SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This revision incorporates the revised roles and responsibilities of the Clinical Quality Division
within AFMOA, the interaction with the MAJCOM/SG offices, and the medical facilities. It
reflects the overarching focus and emerging new standards on patient safety and stresses the
importance of seamless integration with performance improvement, quality, and risk
management. The intent is to work toward establishing a culture in which errors are proactively
identified, incidents reported freely, and patient safety is rooted in the daily operations of the
healthcare organization. It also reflects the ongoing changes in credentialing, privileging, scope
of practice, adverse privileging actions, malpractice processing, and overall clinical performance
improvement and risk management activities. It incorporates numerous interim policy memos
regarding the same. It breaks subject matter into specific chapters, defines roles and
responsibilities to include committees and medical staff functions and reintroduces the role of the
Director of Base Medical Services (Chapter 1), and in a dedicated chapter, introduces new
national standards, guidance, and culture related to Patient Safety (Chapter 2). This instruction
provides integral guidance and tools for improving organizational performance (Chapter 3). It
clarifies licensure requirements for all healthcare providers, to include the difference in
requirements depending on contract types. It also explains the waiver of administrative
requirements for physician licensure, the physician assistant waiver of licensure and the waiver
process for the timeline to obtain licensure processes (Chapter 4), introduces the E-application
for privileges and medical staff appointment, identifies credentials that are obtained off-line and
describes provider documents that must be collected and primary source verified, to include
responsibility and management of the documents that become part of the electronic provider
credentials file (Chapter 5). It better defines responsibilities and processes for the privileging
process, introduces the requirements for completion of the E-application and adopts standard
business processes (Chapter 6). It describes in full the allied health professionals’ educational
background, scope of practice, and supervision requirements and supports the independent
collaborative role of the advanced practice nurse (Chapter 7). It establishes and clarifies the
AFMS’ peer review processes and expectations to include using focused professional practice
evaluations and ongoing professional practice evaluations for privileged providers and outlines
the ongoing peer review process for non-privileged staff. The competency assessment folder
guidelines are standardized and outlined for all officer, civilian, contractor and volunteer staff
(Chapter 8), and the DoD standardized business process is adopted for adverse actions which
standardized the adverse action processes for privileged and non-privileging providers and added
an additional step with a peer review panel to validate clinical implications before the
commander proceeds with the proposed adverse action, provides greater discussion of the
definition and management of impaired professionals and clarification of administrative and
clinical adverse actions, outlines AFMS code of conduct and approach to address intimidating

and disruptive behavior of healthcare professionals (Chapter 9). Provides guidance on the
appropriate management of and the release of quality assurance material and disclosure. Realigns
all risk management processes in one chapter, defines requirements for management of
potentially compensable events, active duty disability and active duty death cases where medical
care provided may have contributed to the outcome, and medical malpractice claims. Defines the
roles and responsibilities in the re-engineered malpractice process (Chapter 10).

Section 1B—Committees and Functions

1.24. AFMS Policy on the Use of Functions. AFMS policy encourages the use of functions
rather than committees to fulfill the requirements for accreditation. Many committees (which
require a charter and formal minutes) have been changed to functions. Functions only require a
summary report (not minutes) be given to the oversight leadership authority. This gives
healthcare facilities greater latitude in how they manage these important activities by reducing
administrative time in meetings, eliminating voluminous minutes, and encouraging creative cost-
saving methods to achieve the desired purpose.
1.25. Functional Review (Summary) Reports. Summary reports should contain a purpose
statement, be simple, factual, and not include voluminous attachments. They should include only
meaningful information (not just data) for reviewers to use to make informed decisions about
facility operations. They should include quantifiable data that is mostly longitudinal and can give
a good comparison over time. For example, describing the monthly or quarterly medication
events is meaningless unless you use comparative data (historical, benchmarks or industry
standards) and explain the reasons for improvement or the opportunities that need to be
addressed. The summary reports should also address both process and outcome. The reports
should be routed to the oversight authority designated by the MTF. (See Kx Toolkit for
templates.)
1.26. Required Committees:
   1.26.1. MTF (for ARC: RMU or MDG) Executive Committee
   1.26.2. Executive Committee of the Medical Staff (ECOMS) (N/A to ARC)
1.27. Recommended Functions: Functions will be applicable within the MTF to include
Limited Scope Medical Treatment Facilities (LSMTFs) (for ARC: RMU or MDG)-defined scope
of care, and may be ad hoc or included as an agenda item in an oversight committee as outlined

                                           Chapter 2

                                      PATIENT SAFETY

2.1. Framework for Safer and More Effective Healthcare.
   2.1.1. A culture of patient safety is demonstrated by an organizational commitment to
   provide safe, high quality patient care via a focus on collaborative teamwork, communication
   and effective processes. This commitment must be shared by leadership and staff members at
   all levels. Organizations with a culture of patient safety acknowledge that medical errors can
   and will occur and strive to identify and reduce risk before it results in harm.
   2.1.2. Patient safety proactively and retroactively identifies potential and actual risks to
   safety, identifies underlying causes and makes the necessary improvements to reduce risks. It
   establishes processes in response to sentinel events and adverse incidents by identifying risks
   through a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and implementing process improvements. Patient
   safety, in collaboration with other activities including performance improvement and risk
   management, promotes a culture of safety in which errors are identified and reported freely
   without retribution. The goal is to reduce variability and vulnerability for error in processes.
   Safety is rooted in the daily operations of the healthcare organization where proactive risk
   identification, assessment and control are the foundation for safe and effective healthcare.
   2.1.3. This systems-based approach to advance a culture of safety, reduce vulnerability, and
   promote competent patient-centered care is driven by the leadership at each medical
   organization through the endorsement and active support of commanders, medical and
   nursing leadership. These concepts are anchored in the organization’s mission, vision,
   prioritization plan, guidance and policies. Leadership will:
      2.1.3.1. Model the behaviors and beliefs as well as speak the language of patient safety.
      2.1.3.2. Advocate for an environment of non-blame and reduction of the fear of
      retribution through recognizing and encouraging good catch, near miss, and event
      reporting, conducting leadership rounds, and encouraging proactive approaches to
      problem solving with the end goal of process improvement.
      2.1.3.3. Promote compliance with National Patient Safety Goals (NPSGs) and initiatives
      working closely with the Patient Safety Manager (PSM) and goal champions.
      2.1.3.4. Focus on prospective and retrospective analysis of events, new and revised
      processes and systems to identify areas of high risk, high volume and high costs.
      2.1.3.5. Reinforce responses to alerts and NOTAMs through thorough assessment of
      impact to the facility.
      2.1.3.6. Ensure that the PSM is involved in key activities and provide advisement and
      consultation to staff.
   2.1.4. Every member of the AFMS strives to create a non-punitive, learning culture by
   focusing on improved communication and cooperation, teamwork, systems and processes
   rather than blame, and prevention rather than punishment.
   2.1.5. Adverse events are avoidable when preventive measures are shared and practiced.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                       29


   2.1.6. Patient Safety is essential to all AFMS operations, including Aeromedical Evacuation
   and deployed locations.

Figure 2.1. The Components of a Patient Safety Program (N/A to ARC).




DoD Healthcare Team Coordination Program (HCTCP). TeamSTEPPS
2.2. Regulatory Compliance.
   2.2.1. All MTFs regardless of accrediting organization will adhere to The Joint Commission
   (TJC) NPSGs including when the goals convert into TJC standards. These goals are designed
   to enhance the safety and quality of care provided, highlight problematic areas in healthcare
   and describe evidence and expert based consensus on solutions to these problems. The
   NPSGs shall be documented in MedFACTS for outpatient MTFs. The Joint Commission’s
   approved self-assessment tool, Periodic Performance Review (PPR) will be used by inpatient
   MTFs to document compliance with the NPSGs.
   2.2.2. All MTFs will utilize each patient’s full name and date of birth as the two standard
   identifiers associated with NPSGs. Use these two patient identifiers at a minimum when
   providing care, treatment or services. The intent of this goal is to reliably identify the
   individual as the person for whom the service or treatment is intended and to match the
   service or treatment to that individual. These same two identifiers must be directly associated
   with medications, blood products, specimen containers and treatments or procedures.
   Standardization of this goal across the AFMS is intrinsic to the delivery of safe, high quality
   healthcare and system-wide solutions.
   2.2.3. All MTFs will adhere to the NPSG for Universal Protocol (UP). UP applies to all
   surgical and non-surgical invasive procedures as determined by the MTF. MTFs will ensure
   UP compliance by developing facility specific processes that utilize the UP Surgical
   Checklist and incorporate elements of the Non-Operating Room Procedure Verification
 30                                                                 AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   Checklists into established processes. The checklist templates are located in the Patient
   Safety Handbook posted on the Kx.
   2.2.4. Each inpatient facility should develop and activate a Rapid Response Team (RRT).
   This is a patient safety initiative designed to speed the identification of and care to patients
   with signs of clinical deterioration or factors suggesting impending deterioration. The facility
   should create an operating instruction with procedures for the team to function within. (See
   Kx Patient Safety website for suggested template). The team is considered a 24-hour asset
   that will respond to calls rapidly.
      2.2.4.1. Inpatient facilities will utilize the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) as a
      component of the RRT activation. The MTF will assign individual responsibilities to
      ensure MEWS compliance, and complete the MEWS on all adult inpatients at least every
      shift.
2.3. Organizational Sharing and Collaboration.
   2.3.1. The PSM will collaborate with other facility functions including Infection Control,
   Facilities and Environment, Medical Equipment Repair and Medical Logistics to ensure the
   full scope of patient safety issues are identified and acted upon.
   2.3.2. When a PCE is identified, the RM will share the event information with the PSM who
   will research the event for process related issues. If after research the event meets the criteria
   for a RCA as outlined in paragraph 2.6, the PSM will then take the appropriate actions to
   initiate a RCA as outlined in the Patient Safety Handbook. If a RCA is not indicated, the
   findings and any corrective actions will be shared with the appropriate MTF leadership and
   forwarded to AFMOA.
   2.3.3. MTFs are encouraged to participate in AF/DoD approved innovations, submit data
   and participate in learning forums to share lessons learned. MTFs are encouraged to
   collaborate with other MTFs and civilian organizations to share best practices and discuss
   patient safety issues for problem solving purposes. MTFs can use benchmarks from other
   agencies to enhance the MTF program and reduce or avoid risk. Specific MTF data cannot be
   shared with civilian organizations without coordination through AFMS leadership.
   2.3.4. MTFs will participate in the Patient Safety Culture Survey, sponsored by the DoD
   Patient Safety Program, at periodic intervals. The survey is designed to evaluate the
   development of a culture of safety within DoD MTFs. The results of the survey will drive
   decision making at the local, AF, and DoD levels. The PSM is responsible for advertising the
   survey and encouraging participation, sharing results with leadership and patient safety
   champions within the organization, and developing, implementing and evaluating action
   plans based on the results.
2.4. Innovations and Lessons Learned.
   2.4.1. Lessons learned are developed at AF and DoD levels using information from MTFs,
   government and civilian agencies. This information can be communicated through
   NOTAMs, alerts, focused reviews and periodic summaries. PSMs will ensure appropriate
   dissemination of information, discussion at the local MTF and action planning as required.
   2.4.2. PSMs, in conjunction with the MTF executive leadership, provide a safe and open
   environment where anyone can share concerns and lessons learned without fear of retribution
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                          31


   and encourage error reporting to promote a culture of safety. Transparency is a key
   ingredient in promoting a non-blame environment and sharing lessons learned.
   2.4.3. MTFs have the opportunity to submit patient safety innovations for consideration of
   AF and/or DoD patient safety awards. AFMS award specifications are IAW AFI 36-2856,
   Medical Service Award. The Office of the Chief Medical Officer (OCMO) at TRICARE
   Management Activity (TMA) sponsors the DoD Patient Safety Awards in conjunction with
   the annual Military Health System (MHS) Conference. The application is located on the DoD
   Patient Safety website.
2.5. Proactive Risk Identification. (N/A to ARC) A proactive risk assessment (PRA) is a
systematic, proactive method for evaluating a process to identify where and how it might fail,
and to assess the relative impact of different failures in order to identify the parts of the process
that are most in need of change. Selected teams of cross-functional healthcare professionals may
use a FMEA as their PRA to evaluate processes for possible failures and to prevent them by
correcting the processes proactively rather than reacting after failures have occurred. PRA is
useful in evaluating a new process prior to implementation and in assessing the impact of a
proposed change to an existing process. Every 18 months each MTF will complete and submit to
AFMOA/SGHQ at least one healthcare PRA. Refer to the Patient Safety handbook for specific
requirements. Leadership direction will be sought for topic selection. The method used is IAW
DoD Patient Safety Program guidance. The MTF PSM will facilitate the PRA process and
provide current DoD PRA tools.
   2.5.1. MTFs may submit a clinically focused AFSO21 process improvement activity as their
   PRA. AFSO21 tools are derived from Lean and Six Sigma methodologies to build in
   efficiencies through the elimination of waste. At no time should patient safety be
   compromised to improve efficiency. After completing an AFSO21, organizations will review
   it to ensure safeguards were not omitted and that streamlining a process will not lead to
   unintended and potentially harmful consequences. Note: Within the AFSO21 Continuous
   Process Improvement-Management Tool (CPI-MT), products containing medical quality
   assurance protected data will be stored in the secure folder with controlled membership to the
   ―Users Group-SG‖.
   2.5.2. The MTF PSM or designee must track outcome measures and report to executive
   leadership no less than quarterly to ensure the success of the PRA.
2.6. RCA. (N/A to ARC)
   2.6.1. An RCA is a retrospective process for identifying the basic or contributing causal
   factors associated with adverse events and near misses. The goal of the RCA is to identify
   systems factors that led to the event and solutions that can prevent or reduce the likelihood of
   similar events in the future. The product of the RCA is the action plan, consisting of specific,
   measurable steps designed to eliminate or minimize the root causes of the event and improve
   safety of the process. The focus is on human factors, processes and systems rather than
   individual blame.
   2.6.2. RCAs will be completed on all sentinel events (as defined by TJC), adverse incidents
   (as defined by the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Healthcare (AAAHC) and those
   events meeting DoD requirements. In addition, RCAs are required on events with increased
   severity of harm and likelihood of reoccurrence. RCAs may also be appropriate for events of
32                                                                 AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


  lesser severity (near misses, good catches, close calls) or when there is a potential for a future
  catastrophic event. In these situations, the decision to complete an RCA will be at the
  discretion of the MTF Commander with guidance from the AFMOA/SGHQ.
  2.6.3. Under the direction of the SGH, the MTF designee will notify their respective
  MAJCOM and AFMOA/SGHQ of all sentinel events, adverse incidents and other events as
  required by DoD. MTFs must complete and forward the Event Notification Form within 48
  hours (see template in the Patient Safety Handbook). MTFs will comply with AF and DoD
  guidelines regarding notification and RCA submission to TJC and DoD.
  2.6.4. The RCA team will be comprised of clinical leaders and subject matter experts
  (SMEs) to review the processes and systems surrounding the event. The team membership
  will vary according to the type of event analyzed with the team’s goal to complete a thorough
  and credible interdisciplinary action plan.
  2.6.5. The RCA and action plan will be completed within 45 calendar days from the date the
  organization first became aware of the event. Organizations shall use the format and
  methodology specified by the DoD Patient Safety Program. Any deviation from this
  requirement must be coordinated with AFMOA/SGHQ. RCAs will not contain identifying
  information on patients or individual healthcare personnel. RCAs are maintained as
  confidential quality assurance records protected by 10 U.S.C. §1102.
  2.6.6. The team shall formally brief the MTF commander and senior leadership upon
  completion and obtain written approval of the RCA and action plan. This briefing provides
  the commander and other leadership the opportunity to interact with the RCA team for
  clarification and necessary changes.
  2.6.7. The action plan shall be implemented and outcome measures tracked and reported to
  the Executive Committee to ensure plan effectiveness. In addition, a follow-up report in
  response to the intervention(s) listed in the action plan will be forwarded to AFMOA/SGHQ
  by the four month due date.
  2.6.8. MTFs will forward a copy of all RCAs to AFMOA/SGHQ for review and feedback by
  the due date. Inpatient MTFs will submit RCAs to TJC as required.
  2.6.9. Leaders recognize that conscientious healthcare workers who are involved in sentinel
  events or adverse incidents are themselves victims and require support. To that end, support
  systems at the MTF should provide those staff involved in the event with additional help and
  resources as needed.
  2.6.10. If, during the course of an RCA, the competence of an individual involved in the
  medical event is in question, the team will also determine if the healthcare system provided
  every opportunity for the individual to succeed. It is crucial to identify process or system
  obstacles that may have affected a patient outcome. If professional competency is questioned
  or the event is identified as a PCE, the team leader will refer the matter to the respective
  corps chief(s). This is a separate process from an RCA and not under the purview of the
  Patient Safety program (see Chapter 8, paragraph 8.8.3 and Chapter 10).
  2.6.11. The RCA team leader and the PSM will refer intentional unsafe acts to leadership to
  be addressed administratively. However, the RCA team should continue to review the event
  to determine if processes or systems contributed to the outcome.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                       33


2.7. Reporting and Data Collection.
   2.7.1. Event, Near Miss, and Good Catch Reporting. Event, near miss and good catch
   reporting contributes to organizational performance improvement and is everyone’s
   professional responsibility. Reporting will be non-punitive and reprisal or administrative
   action should not be taken against the reporter. The organization will maintain a mechanism
   for staff, patients and patients’ families to report events, near misses and any other
   conditions, practices and/or situations which they believe are unsafe. The AFMS shall
   comply with DoD mandated safety reporting systems for both medication and non-
   medication events.
   2.7.2. Reporting is designed to capture and analyze events to determine systems problems
   and minimize harm from medical errors.
   2.7.3. Completing an event report does not signify blame. It is the responsibility of the
   person discovering the event/near miss/good catch to initiate the report process. The
   reporting process requires the person most knowledgeable of the event to record information
   related to what, when, where, how, and any known contributing factors leading to the event.
   Further analysis and review will be required and routed by the PSM to the appropriate
   leadership. Only event facts shall be addressed, personal opinion shall not be included.
   2.7.4. Medication/near miss events will be captured and reported electronically using the
   approved DoD/AF monthly summary reporting system. Events from the pharmacy and
   patient care areas are equally reportable.
   2.7.5. Do’s and Don’ts to Event Reporting:
      2.7.5.1. Do notify the PSM or designee by next duty day after becoming aware of the
      event. The PSM will notify chain of command within two (2) duty days of event
      awareness. (Sentinel Event/Adverse Incident notification shall occur immediately.)
      2.7.5.2. Do report at a minimum the patient demographic information (age, sex, military
      branch and status), facility related information (admission date, admitting diagnosis, unit,
      etc.) and factual description of the event and extent of injury.
      2.7.5.3. Do route event review form (paper or electronic) to PSM who will then route to
      other departments as appropriate.
      2.7.5.4. Do maintain the confidentiality of the event review form and stamp with the
      Quality Assurance protection statement which protects this information from public
      disclosure under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. §1102.
      2.7.5.5. Don’t indicate in the patient’s medical record that an event review form was
      completed and do not allow the event review form to become part of the medical record.
      Do record a factual account of the patient’s condition in the medical record.
      2.7.5.6. Don’t assign blame or admit liability on the event review form or in the medical
      record.
      2.7.5.7. Don’t delay routing event review form for extra review and/or signatures.
      2.7.5.8. Don’t make copies of the event review form.
 34                                                                AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


2.8. Event Analysis. After gathering data and information regarding processes and events, it is
essential for the organization to assess and analyze the risk(s) and determine where best to focus
activities/changes for improvement. The organization will use a harm and severity scale as
outlined in the Patient Safety Handbook to determine the level of assessment required. Less
serious events may be subject to a review such as the 8-step process or RCA while events
resulting in significant harm will require an RCA.
2.9. Categorizing Reported Events. Upon receipt of event reports, the PSM classifies the
event using one of the following categories and helps determine the level of assessment required.
The following terms are defined in the Patient Safety handbook.
   2.9.1. Near Miss/Good Catch.
   2.9.2. Actual Event.
   2.9.3. Sentinel Event (SE)/Adverse Incident.
   2.9.4. Intentional Unsafe Act.
2.10. Tracking and Trending. PSMs will collect, collate, analyze and display data from event
reviews, near misses, good catches, RCAs, FMEAs and other sources. PSMs will disseminate
information to appropriate MTF committees/functions, quality managers and other individuals
for patient safety improvement purposes and awareness.
2.11. Research and Development. PSMs need to be well versed in performing a literature
search for current research and development models in areas relating to patient safety initiatives
or requests from clinical staff. Initiatives include but are not limited to RCAs, FMEAs,
implementation of new patient safety goals and facility process improvements.
2.12. Reporting and Documentation.
   2.12.1. Summary Reports. The PSMs at the MTFs will complete a monthly report using the
   authorized web-based DoD patient safety reporting system. The report will contain a
   summary of events, near misses, good catches and safety initiatives that occurred in the
   previous month. The report is then forwarded through AFMOA/SGHQ Patient Safety to the
   DoD Patient Safety Center. The summary reports shall be used to discern lessons learned and
   improvement opportunities to support the organizations.
   2.12.2. Quarterly Reports to the Executive Staff. The PSM will provide quarterly updates to
   the Executive Staff on organizational patient safety activities, policies and procedures to
   ensure program effectiveness. Content should include NPSG compliance, progress on
   initiatives, and analysis of events and near misses, including efforts to promote reporting.
   2.12.3. Annual (CY) Evaluation/Report. The PSM shall complete an annual evaluation of
   the organization’s patient safety program and provide the evaluation to their MTF Executive
   Leadership. At a minimum, the report shall include education and training on PS, analysis of
   data collected, lessons learned and opportunities to improve, identified results from patient
   safety activities, initiatives taken to eliminate or reduce risk to patients and results of these
   improvements. The report shall also include an appraisal of the adequacy of the MTF’s
   patient safety activities, policies and procedures to ensure program effectiveness. A copy
   shall be sent to AFMOA/SGHQ Patient Safety. The due date for these reports is defined in
   the Patient Safety Handbook.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                          35


   2.12.4. Risk Control. Many existing activities within the delivery of healthcare serve to
   either reduce or eliminate risk. These include, but are not limited to, policy/procedure review
   and revision, staff education/training/orientation, patient/family education, biomedical
   equipment maintenance, etc. All personnel shall be educated about the DoD and the AF
   Patient Safety Program, to include MTF-related risk assessment activities.
2.13. Education and Training.
   2.13.1. PSM Training. The PSM will attend an approved DoD Basic Patient Safety Manager
   course upon hire. Sustainment patient safety training courses are also available on line
   through various sources. Additional training is provided at the AFMS’ Quality Systems
   Program Assessment Review (QSPAR).
   2.13.2. Executive leadership is highly encouraged to attend the DoD Basic Patient Safety
   Manager course. Patient safety elements are embedded in other Air Force leadership courses.
   2.13.3. The organization shall educate all personnel on patient safety concepts and
   implementation. The PSM shall coordinate with the Group Education and Training Officer to
   establish a mechanism to orient and educate all staff on proactive risk identification,
   assessment and control principles and practices. Training shall include, but is not limited to,
   elements of a patient safety culture, its relevance to their position, their personal role in
   ensuring patient safety as a high priority, identification and reporting of patient safety events
   and near misses/good catch, medical team training, and basic concepts of patient safety. The
   PSM is a resource to identify and encourage specific staff members to pursue additional
   patient safety training. Training is available through the DoD Patient Safety Center and the
   DoD HCTCP.
   2.13.4. Patient safety elements must be included in routine Leadership rounds.
   2.13.5. Patient safety must be included in the MTF newcomers’ orientation training.
   2.13.6. Patient safety must be included in the MTF annual recurrent training.
   2.13.7. Patient Safety Awareness Week provides an opportunity to highlight
   accomplishments and increase awareness in patient safety in a creative manner. Activities
   should be planned to focus on both patients and staff.
2.14. Team Training. (N/A to ARC) Working toward a culture of safety through improved
communication and teamwork, organizations shall deploy the DoD HCTCP TeamSTEPPS IAW
DoD 6025.13-R. TeamSTEPPS is an evidence-based comprehensive initiative designed to
improve quality and safety in healthcare and is rooted in over three decades of research in high-
stress, high-risk industries. TeamSTEPPS implementation shall be based on the specific mission,
needs and desires of the organization. Training shall be provided to multidisciplinary teams to
facilitate team collaboration and communication throughout the MTF. High risk areas and those
identified through MII or RCA will have priority for implementation. As part of the
implementation plan, each facility will identify a means to orient new staff to the tools, strategies
and behaviors of TeamSTEPPS adopted by the facility as well as sustainment actions. The AF
TeamSTEPPS program manager will coordinate with the facility POC to provide ongoing
consultation, coaching and follow-up evaluations of the initiative. The MTF PSM or POC will
coordinate with the AF Patient Safety Office at AFMOA/SGHQ and the AF TeamSTEPPS
program manager regarding information for initial implementation. TeamSTEPPS specific

information may be found on the DoD Patient Safety website (see Patient Safety Handbook), the
Patient Safety Learning Center (PSLC) or the AHRQ website.
2.15. Patient Safety Education.
   2.15.1. Patients and families can help participate in their own safety. Communication with
   patients and families about all aspects of their care, treatment, or services is an important
   characteristic of a culture of safety. When patients know what to expect they are more aware
   of possible errors and choices. Patients can be an important source of information about
   potential adverse advents and hazardous conditions. Every opportunity should be afforded to
   maximize patient education and engage the patient in their health care. Suggestions to
   facilitate this include ―Right Start‖ and including patient safety as an agenda item of the
   Health Care Consumer Advisory Council.
   2.15.2. Patients and families are educated on methods to report patient safety concerns and
   are encouraged to do so.
2.16. Evidence Based Design (EBD). (N/A to ARC) EBD is a process used in the planning,
designing, and construction of buildings. It is uniquely suited to healthcare because of the
unusually high stakes and major issues of safety and improved clinical outcomes. A natural
parallel and analog to Evidence Based Medicine is currently being used in the healthcare
industry to help convince decision makers to invest the time and money to build better buildings.
The PSM along with infection control, environmental safety, and facility managers are integral
members of the facility’s planning and design team. A team consisting of the PSM, infection
control, facility safety and executive leadership are encouraged to perform periodic facility
rounds to identify safety concerns.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                       37

                          PERFORMANCE

Section 3A—Accreditation (N/A to ARC)

3.1. Medical Treatment Facilities Requiring Accreditation. AFMS MTFs, to include
LSMTFs, are expected to provide safe, quality healthcare to all assigned beneficiaries. All active
duty fixed hospitals and free-standing ambulatory clinics will maintain civilian accreditation by
nationally recognized agencies.
   3.1.1. TJC is the civilian accrediting agency for AF inpatient facilities.
   3.1.2. AAAHC is the civilian accrediting agency for AF outpatient facilities.
   3.1.3. By close of business on the same day as the exit conference from an Air Force
   inspection or civilian accreditation survey, the MTF/CC will ensure a copy of all preliminary
   reports is faxed or sent via e-mail to AFMOA/SGHQ.
3.2. Policy Conflict with Accrediting Agencies. The AF fully supports accreditation by
civilian agencies. When the military mission requirements result in a conflict with agency
standards, the AF policy prevails. AFMOA/SGHQ or another appropriate authority will pursue
resolution of any conflicts with the accrediting agency.
   3.2.1. MTF will immediately notify AFMOA/SGHQ via phone if any type of no-notice
   survey or inspection occurs.

following equivalencies apply to AFMS:
   3.3.1. HQ USAF/SG is the governing body for all AF MTFs.
   3.3.2. Applicable federal law, DoD, AF directives/instructions, SG policies, MAJCOM
   directives/policies, and local operating policies serve as the bylaws. MTFs may develop
   separate operating instructions for matters not covered by AF policy directive (AFPD), Air
   Force Instruction (AFI), or other regulatory guidance.
   3.3.3. The MTF’s strategic plan describes its purpose, goals, vision, and community
   responsibilities.
   3.3.4. The MTF/CC acts as the chief executive officer and represents the governing body
   locally.
   3.3.5. The MTF/CC designee serves as the chief operating officer (i.e., Deputy MTF/CC or
   another executive committee member).
   3.3.6. The chief of the medical staff (SGH) is the president of the medical staff.
   3.3.7. The chief nurse (SGN) is the nurse executive.
   3.3.8. The MTF administrator (SGA) is the administrator.
 38                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   3.3.9. The MTF Executive Committee formally links the functions of the governing body
   representatives, the chief operating officer, and the medical staff. MTF Executive Committee
   minimum membership is referenced in the AFMS Flight Path.
   3.3.10. Executive Committee of the Medical Staff (ECOMS) or equivalent monitors medical
   staff functions and clinical improvement activities.

Section 3B—Self-inspection

3.4. General. Self-inspection at the MTF, to include LSMTFs, is a tool for leadership to
evaluate programs and processes that impact the delivery of safe, quality healthcare in their area
of responsibility. Most standards for self-inspection are updated at least annually by their
accrediting source and require vigilant attention to ensure we meet our beneficiary and AFMS
expectations for the highest quality of healthcare. The MTF leadership will ensure a continuous
self-inspection process is in place for monitoring accuracy and completion of compliance
standards as outlined by AFMOA, the MAJCOMs, and other national accreditation bodies as
required. RMUs will comply with AFRC Self Inspection guidance and AFI 90-201, Inspector
General Activities.
3.5. Follow Up for Non-Compliance. MTFs will follow up on non-compliance with civilian
accreditation standards and Health Services Inspection (HSI) criteria.
   3.5.1. MTFs accredited with TJC will follow the process directed by TJC.
   3.5.2. MTFs accredited with AAAHC will follow the process directed by AFMOA/CC. See
   Kx Clinical Quality toolkit for more information.
   3.5.3. MTFs will follow the process directed by AFIA for non-compliance with HSI criteria.
3.6. MTF or for ARC: RMU/MDG Coordination with Wing Compliance Inspections.
MTFs or for ARC: RMUs/MDGs will coordinate with their associated Wing and MAJCOM
leadership in regards to required compliance inspections concerning readiness, nuclear surety,
environmental and occupational assessments.
3.7. Self-Inspection Program Manager Appointment. MTF/CC will appoint in writing a
MTF self-inspection program manager(s) to coordinate within the MTF all of the functions in the
assessment and reassessment of all standards applicable to the MTF.
3.8. New Self-Inspection Requirements. Commanders will ensure new section chiefs
(officers and enlisted) accomplish self-inspections of their areas of oversight within 60 calendar
days of assuming duty utilizing the mandated automated self-inspection tool (Refer to paragraph
3.11). Each MTF defines the applicable section(s) with flight level as the minimum requirement.
3.9. Ongoing Self-Assessment Reports. At a minimum, MTF staff annually assesses each
compliance item and provides a status report to the MTF Executive Committee. All inpatient
facilities will submit the automated Periodic Performance Review (PPR) to TJC annually as a
requirement of TJC accreditation.
3.10. Compliance Oversight. The MTF Executive Committee is responsible for the evaluation
of the organization’s overall compliance and progress of action plans for non-compliant
standards and elements. This oversight will be documented in committee minutes.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        39


3.11. Automated Self-inspection Tools. All AFMS MTFs, to include LSMTFs, will use
MedFACTS (Medical Facility Assessment and Compliance Tracking System) to score all
applicable elements of the current AD Health Services Inspection (HSI) guide. Ambulatory
MTFs will use MedFACTS to score the applicable national patient safety goals and current
AAAHC standards. MTFs are allowed to utilize MedFACTS to track other standards, such as
Unit Compliance Inspections, though each MTF will need to enter the standards into their
individual folder. MTFs determine staff access, though MedFACTS visibility includes AFIA
inspectors, HQ functional experts and MAJCOM staff. Note: ANG will use the Self-Inspection
Database (SID) in accordance with AFI 90-201.
   3.11.1. When an element or standard is in compliance, a brief statement to indicate evidence
   of compliance will be entered in MedFACTS. The statement may reference the location
   where further evidence of compliance may be viewed, such as shared drives, meeting
   minutes, or binders. Documents with further evidence of compliance may be uploaded into
   MedFACTS.
   3.11.2. When an element or standard is not in compliance, an action plan(s) will be
   documented in MedFACTS. Documents containing further explanation of the action plan(s)
   can be uploaded in MedFACTS. Reference can be made to where other information about the
   action plan(s) may be viewed such as shared drives, meeting minutes, or binders.
   3.11.3. When an element or standard is not in compliance, the executive leadership will
   receive an initial action plan update at least 60 days after the date the standard was
   determined non compliant. Executive leadership will continue to receive periodic reports (as
   determined by MTF leadership) on the status of action plans until the element or standard is
   in compliance.
   3.11.4. MedFACTS will contain the current and previous three years of self-inspection
   documentation. All other self-inspection documentation will be maintained in accordance
   with AFMAN 33-363 and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition
   Schedule (RDS) located in the AF Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) at
   https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims/cfm.
   3.11.5. Every person granted permission to use MedFACTS will maintain a unique user
   name and secure password, such as first initial with last name versus position or title. Further
   guidance can be obtained from the MedFACTS help desk.
   3.11.6. MedFACTS self-paced training is available via the MedFACTS website. Requests
   for additional training need to be submitted through the MedFACTS help desk.
   3.11.7. Help desk functions, system upgrades and releases, the inputting/updating of HSI
   elements, NPSGs, AAAHC standards will be handled by the technical development team
   located at Gunter AFB. The MedFACTS website contains relevant contact information.

Section 3C—Improving Organizational Performance

3.12. Improving Organizational Performance. The facility maintains an active, integrated,
organized, peer-based program of quality management and improvement that links peer review,
quality improvement activities, and risk management in an organized systematic way.
Performance improvement is a continuous activity and involves measuring the function of
important processes and services, and when indicated, identifies changes that enhance
 40                                                                 AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


performance. These changes are incorporated into new or existing processes, products or
services, and are monitored to ensure improvements are sustained.
   3.12.1. AFSO21 is a dedicated effort to maximize value and minimize waste in our
   operations. The mission of AFSO21 is to strengthen the ability of every Airman to improve
   mission performance in line with the Air Force strategic goals and objectives through
   continuous process improvement, enhance management effectiveness, and shape mindsets
   and behaviors. AFSO21 is a culture change that focuses on processes, not tasks. It evaluates
   the usefulness of a series of linked processes from start to finish, looking at the end-to-end
   system, not just a series of stand-alone processes. AFSO21 does not just look at how we can
   do each task better, but asks the tougher and more important questions: Why are we doing it
   this way and is each of the tasks relevant, productive and value added? In other words, is it
   necessary at all? AFSO21 is about eliminating tasks and processes that do not add value. It is
   about results and is to be used by commanders and personnel at all levels.
   3.12.2. More information about AFSO21 is located on the AF Portal as listed in the
   reference appendix.
3.13. Performance Improvement. Performance improvement focuses on clinical,
administrative, and cost-of-care issues, as well, as patient outcomes (results of care). The leaders
establish a planned, systematic and organization-wide approach, set priorities and ensure
disciplines representing the scope of care and services across the organization work
collaboratively to plan and implement improvement activities. The fundamental components of
PI include staff education, measuring performance through data collection, assessing current
performance, utilizing the data collected to improve organizational processes, services, and
overall performance and re-education.
   3.13.1. PI includes evaluating the following attributes: efficacy, appropriateness, availability,
   timeliness, effectiveness, continuity, safety, efficiency, respect, and caring.
   3.13.2. The AFMS has developed a process to identify key indicators/metrics for evaluation.
   These metrics, located on the Executive Global Look (EGL) website, enable the MTFs to
   compare practices to other similar organizations within the AF and nationally with civilian
   facilities through the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) benchmarks. This
   website provides benchmarks for performance measurement improvement efforts. The EGL
   performance metrics is an integral tool in the USAF/SG’s efforts to promote continuous PI
   throughout the AFMS. The strategy is to measure success in the operation of the Air Force
   MTFs and drive performance standards, baselines, and best practices.
   3.13.3. The MTF leadership will utilize AFMS benchmarks as a baseline for facility PI. The
   goal of facility PI is to ensure the organization designs processes well and systematically
   monitors, analyzes, and improves its performance to improve patient outcomes. The MTF
   Executive Committee analyzes results of key performance activities and metrics to guide
   tactical and strategic planning. Key performance activities are not limited to direct clinical
   care (e.g., logistics, patient administration, medical record availability and other support
   activities). Unless dictated by a higher AF authority, the organization shall select a model for
   process improvement such as the Eight Step OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) Loop
   AFSO21 problem solving cycle, Six Sigma, FOCUS-PDCA (F-Find a function to improve,
   O-Organize the team that knows and cares, C-Clarify and understand the process, U-
   Understand the sources of variation in the process, S-Select a strategy to improve the process
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        41


  and outcome; P-Plan, D-Do, C-Check, A-Act), Design-Measure-Assess-Improve, or 7-Step
  Process. AFSO21 includes these and other corporate developed principles and tools for PI. In
  addition, AFSO21 can be used as a resource and reference for any PI initiative. Note: Within
  the AFSO21 Continuous Process Improvement-Management Tool (CPI-MT), products
  containing medical quality assurance protected data will be stored in the secure folder with
  controlled membership to the ―Users Group-SG‖.
     3.13.3.1. LSMTFs will review/evaluate specific measurable data for the organization
     based on the population and community served and report such data to their professional
     staff to review for trends and to monitor the health of their population, etc. Data that is
     not applicable would be specified and not required. If the LSMTFs require support from
     another agency a memorandum of agreement will define each entities roles and
     responsibilities. Any supporting agency will provide ongoing consultancy and guidance,
     as needed.
  3.13.4. PI activities, based on facility scope of practice and capability, are focused on high-
  risk, problem prone, high volume/top ten diagnoses and high cost areas but are not limited to
  those areas. Examples of potentially high-risk patient processes include blood/blood product
  use, surgical case review, medication administration, and emergency services. High
  volume/top ten diagnoses can be determined from multiple sources, i.e., coding data,
  Biometric Data Quality Assurance Service (BDQAS). Problem prone sources may be
  determined by event reporting; NOTAMs, FMEA, current literature and lessons learned from
  medical malpractice issues. Examples of high cost areas include medication utilization,
  radiology/laboratory studies, follow-up care, referral management, and surgical procedures.
  3.13.5. When determining an appropriate sample size for measuring facility processes rather
  than an individual practice review, the sample size should be large enough to be statistically
  significant if possible. The following sample sizes are recommended:
     3.13.5.1. Sample size of 30 cases for a population size of up to 100 (if the population
     size is less than 30 cases, sample 100% of available cases).
     3.13.5.2. Sample size of 50 cases for a population size of 101 to 500 cases.
     3.13.5.3. Sample size of 70 cases for a population size of greater than 500 cases.
  3.13.6. Data is aggregated and analyzed over time. Statistical tools are used to analyze and
  display data such as run charts, control charts, bar graphs, etc.
  3.13.7. Internal and external comparative analysis is an effective method to identify
  improvement opportunities. Leadership is key to PI and has responsibility for the accuracy of
  data collected for review and comparison with internal and external organizations, i.e.,
  ORYX®; TJC Quality Check, and HEDIS measurements.
  3.13.8. Analysis occurs for those topics chosen by leaders as PI priorities and analysis is
  performed when an undesirable variation occurs which changes priorities. Collected and
  analyzed data and lessons learned may be used to make decisions or changes that improve
  performance and patient safety. Results of data analysis may include: no action, more data
  collection, or development of an action plan.
  3.13.9. Ongoing, proactive Patient Safety and Risk Management programs are essential in
  reducing unanticipated adverse events and safety risks to patients and are a critical part of PI.

   3.13.10. Performance improvement studies submitted for quality awards must be routed
   through AFMOA/SGHQ before release to external organizations.

Section 3D—Tools and Information Sources

3.14. Assessment of MTF Clinical Quality. MTF clinical quality can be assessed by
benchmarking nationally recognized measures. AFMS performance measurement tools (PMTs)
are a major step toward improved information for better resource allocation, quality, and
demand/disease management decisions at all levels. Performance is currently assessed in three
major areas of healthcare: technical outcomes (readiness and managed care), customer service,
and financial performance. The PMTs use standardized metrics and, where possible, automated
data collection. These ―foundation-building‖ metrics include promoting data integrity to ensure
enrollment data is correct as well as identifying functional and technical deficiencies early and
addressing them quickly. The goal is to make data collection, analysis, and use as easy as
possible to support AFMS continuous PI. The ―desired‖ end state is an accountable, transparent
health plan with data-driven performance improvement.
3.15. The Knowledge Exchange. (https://kx.afms.mil) The Knowledge Exchange (Kx) is the
AFMS intranet site. The Kx is designed to store, share, and exchange information among all
members of the AFMS. At the heart of the Kx is an industrial strength document repository,
complete with a robust security model and capacity to store terabytes of documents. The Kx
contains over 350 distinct sites. They are arranged in hierarchical manner and organized by
formal organization and AFMS function. These sites are referred to as ―Knowledge Junctions‖
because each site is designed to bring together documents, people, and other sources of
knowledge useful to a particular group within the AFMS.
3.16. EGL. (https://kx.afms.mil/decisionsupport) This website displays the performance
measurement improvement efforts within AFMS. The EGL performance metrics is an integral
tool in the USAF/SG’s efforts to promote continuous PI throughout the AFMS. The strategy is to
measure success in the operation of the AF MTFs and drive performance standards, establishes
baselines, and best practices.
3.17. Military      Health        System       Clinical     Quality      Management   (MHS-

Council. Clinical practice guideline development initially evolved in response to studies
demonstrating significant variations in risk-adjusted practice patterns and costs. Researchers
hypothesized that establishing criteria for the appropriate use of procedures and services might
decrease inappropriate utilization and improve patient outcomes. While definitive evidence is not
yet available, these clinical practice guidelines appear to be having an appreciable impact on
medical care. Guidelines, act as generic tools to improve the processes of care for patient
cohorts, serve to reduce errors, and provide consistent quality of care and utilization of resources
throughout the system. Guidelines also are cornerstones for accountability and facilitate learning
and the conduct of research.
3.20. AFMOA/SGHQ Website. (https://kx.afms.mil/clinicalquality) This website for the
AFMOA/SGHQ, a Field Operating Agency (FOA) whose commander reports to the AF/SG. It is
used as a primary communications tool to announce and centralize information pertaining to the
field units of the AFMS. Its various sections range from the urgent to the historical and from
specific AFIs to general items of information over the entire spectrum of Clinical Quality
Management for the AF to include Credentials and Privileging, Risk Management, Clinical
Consultants, Policy, Clinical Practice Guidelines, Continuing Education and more.
3.21. Centralized              Credentials      Quality         Assurance            System
(CCQAS). (https://ccqas.csd.disa.mil) CCQAS is a worldwide, web-based Tri-Service DoD
database that contains credentialing, privileging, adverse actions, and risk management
information designed to assist MTFs in managing their assigned healthcare providers. CCQAS
assists the MTF in managing the credentialing/privileging/risk management processes and
generates reports and letters.
3.22. Health Services Inspection (HSI). (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.
asp?Filter= OO-SG-AF-80) HSIs are conducted under the authority of the USAF/IG by the Air
Force Inspection Agency (AFIA). HSI teams assess the ability of AF medical units to fulfill their
peacetime and wartime missions. AFIA does not create health services policy. These policies are
developed by the Offices of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, USAF/SG,
MAJCOMs and various civilian medical oversight agencies. The AFIA inspects compliance with
existing policies and community standards of clinical practice. The most current HSI Guide is
available at the AFIA website. The Elements are annually loaded into MedFACTS to assist units
in their self-inspection program.

                                          Chapter 4

   LICENSURE, CERTIFICATION, AND/OR REGISTRATION OF HEALTHCARE
                             PERSONNEL

Section 4A—Personnel Required to be Licensed, Certified, and/or Registered

4.1. Professional Groups Requiring License, Certification, and/or Registration:
   4.1.1. The following healthcare practitioners must possess and maintain an active
   (characterized by present activity, participation, practice, or use); current (not revoked,
   suspended, or lapsed); valid (the issuing authority accepts and considers professional
   performance and conduct in determining continued licensure); and unrestricted (not subject
   to state imposed stipulations or restriction pertaining to the scope, location, or type of
   practice ordinarily granted to all other applicants for similar licensure in the granting
   jurisdiction) license from a US jurisdiction before practicing independently within the
   defined scope of practice for their specialty: audiologists, chiropractors, clinical
   psychologists, clinical social workers, dentists, dental hygienists, occupational therapists,
   optometrists, pharmacists, physical therapists, physicians, physician assistants (non-personal
   service contract only), podiatrists, practical/vocational nurses, registered nurses (RN),
   advanced practice nurses (RN and APN license, see paragraph 4.1.1.6 for more detail), and
   speech pathologists. See paragraph 4.4.5. for further discussion of an unrestricted license.
       4.1.1.1. State licensing boards and other national agencies issue and may revoke
       authorizing documents to practice (licensure, registration, certification). When an action
       is taken against a provider’s ability to practice, the AF informs the appropriate state
       licensing boards and other national agencies IAW DoD 6025.13-R and Federal law (as
       outlined in paragraphs 9.71., 9.73., and 9.74.2.).
       4.1.1.2. Physician Assistants (PAs) must possess and maintain an active, current, valid,
       and unrestricted nationally recognized certification. In addition, non-personal service
       contract PAs are required to be licensed in the state of practice.
          4.1.1.2.1. PAs (other than non-personal services contract PAs) are exempt from the
          licensure requirement due to the fact that most states have specific supervision
          requirements that are impractical, if not impossible, to meet given the diverse and
          mobile population in DoD medical operations. In response, Assistant Secretary of
          Defense for Health Affairs has exercised the authority to waive the license
          requirement, as long as the PA has successfully met the criteria outlined in paragraph
          7.16., when privileges are initially granted or renewed. Therefore, PAs who have
          been granted privileges within the MHS by an authorized privileging authority will be
          automatically granted a waiver. This waiver is automated and the information is pre-
          populated in CCQAS under the licensure tab. The waiver date matches the date
          privileges were granted and expires with privileges or the expiration date of the
          national certification, whichever comes first. The waiver is automatically reissued
          based on renewal of privileges and/or national certification. Monitoring for
          compliance will be accomplished by the Standard Unlicensed Provider Report in
          CCQAS; therefore, the unlicensed tab within CCQAS should be completed.
 46                                                              AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


      4.1.1.3. Newly accessed military clinical social workers must, at a minimum, have a
      Master of Social Work (MSW) level of state license and be working toward obtaining a
      license that allows practice of clinical social work without supervision. Non-military and
      Reserve clinical social workers must have the level of state licensure that is unrestricted
      and allows independent clinical practice without supervision. (Refer to paragraph 7.10.
      for additional information).
      4.1.1.4. Certified alcohol and drug abuse counselors (CADAC) must possess and
      maintain an active, current, valid, and unrestricted nationally recognized certification
      (refer to paragraph 7.22.).
      4.1.1.5. Clinical dietitians must possess and maintain an active, current, valid, and
      unrestricted nationally recognized registration (refer to paragraph 7.7.).
      4.1.1.6. The following advanced practice registered nurses must possess and maintain a
      current, valid, and unrestricted RN license from a US jurisdiction (as described in
      paragraphs 4.1.1. and 4.4.5.2.) as well as an AF approved national specialty certification:
      nurse anesthetists, nurse-midwives, and nurse practitioners. Advanced practice registered
      nurses in the AFMS must be licensed to the advanced practice level IAW the US
      jurisdiction requirements of their currently held RN license. Some US jurisdictions
      provide a separate license for the advanced practice specialty; others provide only one
      license which indicates an advanced level of practice.
      4.1.1.7. Refer to Chapter 7 for further information about licensure, registration, and/or
      certification requirements for healthcare professionals.
4.2. Authorizing Document to Practice.
   4.2.1. Scope of Licensure Requirement. Military, civil service, personal services contract
   personnel, and volunteers (reference DoDI 1100.21, Voluntary Services in the Department of
   Defense) who require a license to perform their duties must maintain a license from any US
   jurisdiction. Non-personal services contract personnel providing care within the MTF must
   be licensed in the jurisdiction in which the MTF is located.
   4.2.2. Other Authorizing Documents to Practice. For those whose authorizing document to
   practice is a national certification (physician assistant, substance abuse counselor) or
   registration (dietitian); they are exempt from maintaining a license from a particular
   jurisdiction (i.e., US state/territory).
   4.2.3. Deployed personnel must possess and maintain an active, current, valid, and
   unrestricted license or other required authorizing document to practice (i.e., national
   certification) and be privileged to practice independently.
   4.2.4. Assignment to a position not involving direct patient care within or outside an MTF
   does not eliminate the requirement to maintain an active, current, valid, unrestricted license
   and/or authorizing document to practice.
   4.2.5. Contract Providers. The type of contract determines the licensure requirement for
   contract personnel, whether it is personal services or non-personal services. The best way to
   differentiate between these types of contracts is to consider the relationship between the MTF
   and the individual.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                      47


     4.2.5.1. Personal services contract employees are managed and supervised as if they are
     civil service or active duty. For purposes of liability they are considered government
     employees. Personal services contract employees must maintain a current, active,
     unrestricted license from any US jurisdiction or an authorizing document to practice as
     outlined in paragraph 4.1.1.
     4.2.5.2. Non-personal services contract personnel are independent contractors and are
     required to carry professional liability insurance. The Federal Tort Claims Act does NOT
     cover this individual. The contractor is responsible to ensure that the individual has
     malpractice liability coverage and often indemnifies its employee. Non-personal services
     contract employees must maintain a current, unrestricted, active license from the state in
     which they are practicing and, if required, a certification or registration when caring for
     patients within the MTF.
     4.2.5.3. Non-Personal Services Contract Providers Involved in Telehealth. Non-personal
     services contract providers engaged in telehealth need to comply with the licensure
     requirements for telehealth in the state in which the patient is located.
     4.2.5.4. Non-Personal Services Contract Physician Assistants (PAs). Depending on the
     specific state, this provider may have supervision requirements imposed by the state
     board of licensure that exceeds AF requirements. For those PAs who require additional
     supervision, there are three possible methods to meet this need, listed in the order of
     preference: 1) The contractor is responsible to provide the additional supervision. In this
     case, the MTF would cooperate by providing copies of records for this external review
     ensuring HIPAA requirements are met; 2) The MTF petitions the state board of licensure
     to honor licensure portability (refer to 10 U.S.C., §1094) to allow the MTF physician
     supervisor to provide all of the necessary supervision; 3) A physician assigned to the
     MTF meets the state licensure requirements to provide the supervision. When a MTF
     provider is providing supervision they are obligated to meet the state’s supervision
     requirements even if it exceeds the AFMS’ requirements as described in paragraph 7.16.
     Ideally, should the MTF need to utilize contracted PAs, it is recommended they be hired
     via personal services contracts.
     4.2.5.5. Non-Personal Services Contract Nurses. In 1999, the National Council of State
     Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) developed the Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC). The NLC
     legislation allows for US states and territories to enter into a mutual recognition compact
     for      nurses       licensed     across      jurisdictional     borders       (refer    to
     http://www.ncsbn.org/nlc/index.ast). A nurse who resides in a compact state/territory
     receives his/her license in that home state and can practice on that privilege in other NLC
     jurisdictions. The nurse is bound to practice under that state's nursing practice act where
     care is actually delivered.
        4.2.5.5.1. If a contract nurse is licensed in a state not included in the NLC and is
        practicing in a MTF he/she must be licensed according to the regulatory requirements
        of the state in which they are practicing.
     4.2.5.6. Contract providers who practice exclusively outside the MTF are not
     credentialed or privileged by the MTF, for example, optometrists contracted by AAFES.
     All contract providers who perform their duties in the MTF must be credentialed and
     privileged by the MTF according to AF requirements and, if non-personal services
 48                                                                 AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


       contractors, must be licensed according to the regulatory requirements of the State in
       which they are practicing. EXCEPTION: Providers contracted for interpretative services,
       reference paragraph 6.39.
   4.2.6. American Citizens Hired Overseas. In order for an MTF located outside the US
   jurisdiction to hire an American citizen under a non-personal services contract, the MTF
   must obtain a waiver from the host country. This waiver must include a statement that the
   individual is to provide services only on the US Federal enclave and is required to be
   licensed in any US jurisdiction rather than the host nation. Another option is for the
   individual to obtain a license, or other authorizing document, from the host nation via
   endorsement or reciprocity.
4.3. Obtaining and Maintaining Licenses. Obtaining and maintaining a license or other
authorizing documents to practice is the professional and personal responsibility of each
healthcare professional, regardless of whether they are functioning in a clinical, non-clinical or
administrative role.
   4.3.1. Permissive temporary duty is authorized for military personnel taking license
   examinations. Civilian employees will be in official duty status when obtaining and renewing
   professional credentials, to include professional accreditation, state/municipally-imposed
   professional licenses, professional certifications and examinations to obtain such credentials
   IAW AFI 36-815, Absence and Leave.
   4.3.2. All civilian healthcare personnel considering employment or other affiliation with the
   AFMS, must obtain and maintain an active, current, valid, and unrestricted license,
   certification, or registration as a condition of employment. Personnel cannot use appropriated
   funds to pay fees for obtaining and maintaining a license except in the following instances:
       4.3.2.1. When the MTF requires military providers to participate in an external resource
       sharing agreement with a civilian institution that does not recognize the licensure
       portability statute (described in paragraph 4.8.), the military provider must be licensed in
       the state of practice. In this instance, Federal Statute, Title 10 United States Code Section
       1096, allows the Secretary of Defense to reimburse the military member up to $500.00
       (of the amount of the license fee paid by the member) from local MTF funds toward
       obtaining said license.
       4.3.2.2. Active duty dental hygienists may submit a voucher for reimbursement of costs
       associated with obtaining and maintaining state licensure. MTFs can use DHP O&M
       appropriated funds to provide reimbursement.
   4.3.3. Refer to AFI 41-104, Professional Board and National Certification Examinations,
   for guidance on circumstances in which a military member may be reimbursed for fees and
   expenses associated with taking professional board and national certification exams.
   4.3.4. The status of individual professional licensure, certification, and/or registration for all
   healthcare practitioners will be monitored at the MTF or for ARC: RMU/MDG level on a
   regular basis (see paragraphs 5.3.3. through 5.3.5.) for those healthcare professionals
   required to be entered in CCQAS. Those healthcare professionals who have not yet obtained
   the required authorizing document to practice must have a written explanation documented in
   the    provider’s     CCQAS       record     on     the    unlicensed      tab     within     the
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                         49


   licensure/registration/certification section. Monitoring of the licensure, registration, and/or
   certification status may be accomplished utilizing the standard CCQAS reports.
      4.3.4.1. The status of authorizing documents to practice for healthcare professionals who
      are required to maintain a license, registration, or certification but are not currently
      mandated to be entered in CCQAS (see paragraph 5.3.2.) will be monitored in accordance
      with MTF or for ARC: RMU/MDG local policy. CCQAS could be used to track the
      license, registration or certification of these individuals.
   4.3.5. AFMOA/SGHQ oversees the quality of data in CCQAS and works directly with the
   MTF or ARC POC to identify unlicensed providers and provide guidance on resolution.

Section 4B—Management of Licensure Issues

4.4. Guidance on Licensure Requirements:
   4.4.1. Those active duty personnel accessed from professional training or who complete
   other training and require a license, certification, and/or registration to practice, must obtain
   such authorizing documents within 1 year of the date when all required didactic and clinical
   requirements are met or within 1 year of completion of postgraduate year one (PGY-1) for
   doctors of medicine (MD) and doctors of osteopathy (DO). Failure to meet this requirement
   will be handled as described in paragraph 4.6.
      4.4.1.1. For physicians to be eligible for licensure, they must successfully complete Step
      III of the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) (Comprehensive Osteopathic
      Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX) for DOs) and complete 1 year of
      postgraduate (PG) training. In order to meet the AF requirement, physicians who choose
      to be licensed in a state that requires more than 1 year of PG training must also obtain a
      license from another state that requires only 1 year of PG training.
   4.4.2. According to DoD 6025.13-R, healthcare providers who do not yet meet licensure,
   certification, and/or registration requirements may practice only under a written plan of
   supervision. Within the AFMS, those healthcare practitioners who do not meet the licensure,
   certification and/or registration requirements may be granted supervised privileges and are
   required to have a written plan of supervision. The supervision provided must be from a
   licensed, fully qualified, independently practicing, and, if appropriate, privileged provider of
   the same or similar specialty. (See paragraph 6.28.2. for further information and Attachment
   1 for definition of supervised privileges.)
   4.4.3. Licensure Requirements for Clinical Psychologists. Clinical psychologists who have
   not been awarded their doctoral degree (N/A to the ARC) are required to make continual
   progress toward completion of their doctoral dissertation and state licensure requirements
   throughout the period of their initial contract with the AF. Those who have been awarded
   their doctoral degree are required to make continual progress toward state licensure
   requirements throughout the period of their initial contract with the AF (N/A to the ARC).
   Due to differences in dissertation requirements, no specific guideline can be defined for all
   clinical psychologists. In most cases, the time required is 20 months. The majority of states
   require 1 year of postdoctoral supervision before a clinical psychologist is eligible for testing
   and licensure. Clinical psychologists are allowed 3 years from the date the doctoral degree is
   awarded or the date the clinical internship is completed (whichever is earlier) to obtain a state
50                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


  license to accommodate the variation of state licensing requirements. (Reference paragraphs
  7.9.4. and 7.9.5. for information regarding supervision and privileging requirements.)
  4.4.4. Licensure Requirements for Dentists, New Dental Accessions, Health Professions
  Scholarship Program (HPSP) Dental Graduates, and Advanced Education in General
  Dentistry (AEGD) Residents. Dentists must hold a current, active, unrestricted license to
  practice dentistry in a state or jurisdiction of the US except as noted below:
     4.4.4.1. Direct accession dentists must show proof of having passed both Part 1 and Part
     2 of the National Board and a state or regional licensing clinical board exam. In addition,
     they must show proof of having applied for a license to practice dentistry prior to
     entering AD. An unrestricted active license must be obtained within 1 year of arrival at
     the first permanent duty location.
     4.4.4.2. Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) graduates who must serve an
     AD service commitment, and other new dental graduates entering an AF PGY-1 program
     must show proof of having passed both Part 1 and Part 2 of the National Board and of
     having taken a state or regional licensing clinical board exam prior to entering AD. A
     license must be obtained within 1 year of arrival at the first permanent duty station for
     members not completing a PGY-1 program. PGY-1 program graduates who are applying
     for licensure based on the completion of PGY-1 program have an additional 6 months to
     obtain licensure.
     4.4.4.3. Failure to obtain a license within the time frames outlined above may result in
     administrative discharge actions IAW AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers.
     (Reference paragraph 4.6. for further information).
  4.4.5. Meaning of Unrestricted License:
     4.4.5.1. For non-physician professionals who are members of the Biomedical Sciences
     Corps (BSC) and Dental Corps (DC), an unrestricted license (meaning authorizing
     document) is one in which the individual has met all clinical and professional
     requirements, has no clinical limitations or restrictions, and is able to practice full scope
     of care in the jurisdiction once all administrative requirements are met. Therefore, for
     non-physicians, state waiver of renewal fees, malpractice insurance, payment into risk
     pool, etc., may be accepted as long as the license is clinically and professionally
     equivalent to the individual’s civilian counterpart’s license.
     4.4.5.2. For Nurse Corps (NC) and Medical Corps (MC) healthcare professionals an
     unrestricted license is one in which the individual has met all clinical, professional, and
     administrative requirements, and has no clinical limitations or restrictions. The healthcare
     professional must be able to practice in the jurisdiction of the issuing agency immediately
     seeing non-DoD beneficiaries without first taking any additional action (i.e., pay a
     renewal fee) on the license.
     4.4.5.3. A non-personal services contract physician working within the MTF must have a
     medical license that meets all clinical, professional, and administrative requirements of
     the issuing state and be no different than his or her civilian counterpart’s license
     (reference paragraph 4.5.2. for exceptions).
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                          51


      4.4.5.4. This requirement applies to physicians in residency programs, once they become
      eligible for licensure as described in paragraphs 4.4.1. and 4.4.1.1.
4.5. Waiver of Administrative Licensure Requirements for Physicians (Not Applicable for
Non-Personal Services Contract Physicians):
   4.5.1. DoD 6025.13-R outlines the provisions for implementation of 10 U.S.C. §1094 which
   allows a waiver of the unrestricted scope requirement only in ―unusual circumstances.‖ The
   ASD (HA) permits waiver of administrative licensure requirements that are unusual,
   substantial, and inharmonious with Federal policy. Examples include payment of
   malpractice/risk pool fees or requirement to reside or to be practicing in the state of licensure.
      4.5.1.1. If the only administrative requirement is payment of renewal fees, this will not
      be waived.
      4.5.1.2. Waiver of permissible administrative requirements is not automatic. Once
      determined to be eligible for waiver, each physician must submit an application for
      waiver (see Attachment 3). Once the waiver is granted, it is only good for that licensure
      renewal period. The physician must submit a new application for each licensure renewal
      period. Waivers are not renewed upon PCS unless it coincides with that licensure renewal
      period.
          4.5.1.2.1. Approved waivers are scanned as the second page of the provider’s license
          document, named IAW the document naming conventions located in the Kx C&P
          toolkit, uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF (CCQAS record) and annotated in
          CCQAS. Waivers approved prior to the completion of the provider’s 1st E-application
          were filed in Section VI of the PCF with the copy of the provider’s license.
      4.5.1.3. If a physician has, and intends to maintain, two or more licenses with state-
      exempted administrative requirements, and the licensure requirement can be met by
      paying renewal fees (versus applying for waiver as just described), he or she is not
      eligible for waiver of administrative licensure requirement. In addition, the waiver is not
      required if the provider has a current, valid and unrestricted license from another US
      jurisdiction.
      4.5.1.4. The HQ USAF/SG has delegated waiver authority to the MTF/CC. For
      physicians attending AFIT programs the delegated waiver authority will be HQ
      AETC/SG. For physicians in deferred/re-deferred training programs the delegated waiver
      authority will be AFPC/DPAM. Waivers will be granted for only those states approved
      by ASD/(HA). (See Attachment 3 and the Kx C&P toolkit for list of approved states.)
      4.5.1.5. If a state has an unusual and substantial administrative licensure requirement, not
      previously identified by DoD, a waiver request package may be generated by the MTF.
      This package contains the waiver request memorandum (see Attachment 3 and the Kx
      C&P toolkit for waiver request memorandum template) and detailed information along
      with supporting documentation from the state licensing board. The complete package is
      forwarded to AFMOA/SGHQ to coordinate the HQ USAF/SG review. If HQ USAF/SG
      determines there is merit, the request will be submitted to the ASD(HA) for
      consideration. The ASD(HA)’s decision will then be disseminated to the MTF/CC.
 52                                                                  AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   4.5.2. Overseas Local Hire Healthcare Providers Caring for DoD Beneficiaries. Healthcare
   personnel from jurisdictions other than the US require written practice authorization
   (permission to practice) to fulfill the requirements in paragraphs 4.1. through 4.2.1. and are
   required to have documented proof of English language competency and current clinical
   skills. Newly employed healthcare personnel shall practice with supervised
   privileges/practice for 1 year. Focused and ongoing professional practice evaluation will
   provide evidence of current competence to serve as the basis for continuation of practice.
   During this time, continued practice authorization must be obtained based on the following:
       4.5.2.1. Certification by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates
       (ECFMG) (for physicians), certification by the Commission on Graduates of Foreign
       Nursing Schools (CGFNS) (for nurses), or
       4.5.2.2. Demonstration of all of the following:
          4.5.2.2.1. Comprehension and proficiency in oral and written use of the English
          language provided by an external agency.
          4.5.2.2.2. Clinical competency documented and assessed by objective performance
          measures.
          4.5.2.2.3. Possession of either a current, valid, unrestricted license, certification,
          registration, or other authorizing document to practice in the country of employment
          (host nation) or a license, certification, or registration accepted by the US as a basis
          for employment and practice in that country.
   4.5.3. Foreign National Physicians and Dentists Whose Practice Is Limited to Foreign
   National Employees of the US at Overseas Locations. These providers are exempt from the
   requirements of paragraph 4.5.2. but must possess a license or equivalent that would enable
   them to care independently for patients in the country of residence (host nation). Note: This
   applies only to MTFs located overseas.
4.6. Failure to Obtain or Maintain a License, Certification, or Registration.
   4.6.1. A healthcare professional who does not obtain an active, current, valid, unrestricted
   license or other authorizing document will not practice independently (see paragraph 4.4. for
   guidance on requirements).
   4.6.2. Healthcare professionals who fail to maintain a license, registration or certification
   will be removed from independent practice and privileged providers will be placed in
   abeyance. If time exceeds 30 days of abeyance, the provider will be placed in summary
   suspension IAW paragraph 9.20. until the license, registration or certification is renewed.
   Issuing agency grace periods are not honored by the AFMS when renewing a license,
   certification, or registration.
   4.6.3. One or more of the following actions will be taken when a healthcare professional
   fails to obtain or maintain a required license, certification, or registration within the specified
   time frame:
       4.6.3.1. Subject to the needs of the AFMS, the individual may be cross-trained into
       another career field or revert to previous AFSC, if applicable.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        53


       4.6.3.2. MTF/CCs should take action to withdraw the provider’s additional special pay
       and incentive special pay (if applicable). Related references: Medical Officer Specialty
       Pay Plan, published yearly, and AFI 41-109, Special Pay for Health Professionals.
       4.6.3.3. Regular and Reserve officers on extended AD may be involuntarily separated
       under AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures for Commissioned Officers, or
       AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers, or both.
       4.6.3.4. The MTF/CC may request a waiver of the timeline to obtain licensure,
       certification, and/ or registration.
           4.6.3.4.1. The MTF forwards the package containing the MTF/CC’s recommendation
           along with supporting justification for either a waiver of the timeline to obtain
           licensure, certification, and/or registration (see paragraph 4.4.) or request for
           separation/discharge to AFMOA/SGHQ.
           4.6.3.4.2. AFMOA/SGHQ will ensure appropriate documentation and coordination
           of the waiver package and present the case to AFMOA/CC. AFMOA/CC may
           approve waivers up to 12 months. Waivers disapproved by AFMOA/CC or exceeding
           12 months will be submitted to HQ USAF/DSG for disposition with informational
           copy to MAJCOM/SG. If the HQ USAF/DSG recommends separation/discharge, the
           package will be forwarded to AFPC/DPAM for disposition.
   4.6.4. ARC providers who fail to maintain their required license, certification, or registration
   may be separated under AFI 36-3209, Separation and Retirement Procedures for Air
   National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members.
       4.6.4.1. For Reserve Personnel Only: National Registry of Emergency Medical
       Technician (NREMT) certification for the award and retention of AFSCs 4N0XX is
       required. Personnel who have not maintained their certification will be entered into
       training status code ―T‖ for a 90 day period. These individuals will not be a deployable
       asset (SORTS reporting will reflect this action) nor will they be allowed to perform duties
       which require patient care. Individuals in Training Specialty Code ―T‖ are ineligible for
       reassignment, reenlistment or promotion. Their commander will evaluate members after
       the 90-day period and those individuals who have not obtained the required certification
       will initiate action to withdrawal their AFSC IAW AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military
       Personnel (Officers and Enlisted). If the members do not voluntarily retrain, the
       commander may initiate involuntary retraining or re-assign to the Inactive Ready
       Reserve.
   4.6.5. Civil service personnel may be terminated under AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse
   Actions. All MTFs will consult with their supporting civilian personnel office for potential
   actions with civil service or local-hire personnel.
   4.6.6. Contract personnel who failed to maintain required authorizing document to practice
   may be terminated under their contract. All MTFs will consult with their local contracting
   officer for consideration of termination of contract.
4.7. Clinically Restricted Licenses. All individuals who are licensed or maintain certification
or registration must immediately notify their clinical supervisor and MTF senior corps
representative when an agency is considering or has imposed a clinical or professional restriction
 54                                                                 AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


on their license, certification, or registration. For privileged providers, the credentials function
will evaluate the proposed or actual clinical or professional restrictions imposed on the
individual’s license/certification/registration and take appropriate action.
4.8. Portability of State Licensure. DoD 6025.13-R establishes procedures under Title 10
U.S.C. §1094(d) to permit licensed military physicians and other military healthcare
professionals to perform DoD official duties in authorized locations. AFMS officials responsible
will, prior to assigning licensed providers to off-base duties, follow the procedures established in
this AFI to promote cooperation and goodwill with State licensing boards. Off-base duties
include, but are not limited to, training or skill maintenance duties in non-DoD healthcare
facilities; professional activities performed under the authority of the military-civilian health
services partnership program; and telemedicine services involving a patient outside an MTF and
any military installation. Off-base duties do not include participation in approved post-graduate
training of physicians.
   4.8.1. Qualifications. To be eligible for assignment of off-base duties, the healthcare
   professional will:
       4.8.1.1. Have and maintain a current, valid, and unrestricted license or other authorizing
       document (i.e., certificate or registration, reference paragraph 4.2.) that encompasses the
       professional activities involved in the off-base duty assignment.
       4.8.1.2. Not be assigned to off-base duties if there is an unresolved allegation, which, if
       substantiated, would result in an adverse licensing or privileging action.
       4.8.1.3. Have current clinical competence to perform the professional duties assigned.
       4.8.1.4. In the case of physicians and other privileged providers, current clinical
       privileges will be granted and maintained IAW Chapter 6. Alternatively, if such duties
       are outside the scope of clinical privileges granted by the applicable privileging authority,
       the provider will have clinical competence sufficient for such privileges.
       4.8.1.5. In the case of physicians, the following additional qualification requirements
       apply:
           4.8.1.5.1. The physician will have completed at least three years of approved post-
           graduate training (including completion of PGY-3) or have achieved American Board
           of Medical Specialties (ABMS) or American Osteopathic Association (AOA)
           specialty board certification.
           4.8.1.5.2. The physician will have maintained current competence, in that if ten years
           or more have passed since completion of the licensing examination, the physician
           must have ABMS/ AOA specialty board certification.
           4.8.1.5.3. The physician will be current with applicable continuing medical education
           requirements as delineated in AFI 41-117, Medical Service Officer Education.
       4.8.1.6. In all cases in which the off-base duty will be performed in a non-DoD
       healthcare facility, the healthcare professional will follow the rules and bylaws of such
       facility; to the extent they are applicable to the professional.
   4.8.2. Coordination with State Licensing Boards Prior to Performing Assigned Duty
   locations. Prior to a healthcare professional performing off-base duties under the authority of
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                   55


  10 U.S.C. 1094(d), the AFMS official responsible (MTF/CC) will notify the applicable
  licensing board of the host State of the duty assignment involved. Such notification will
  include the name of the healthcare professional; the healthcare professional’s State(s) of
  licensure; the location and expected duration of the off-base duty assignment; the scope of
  duties; the healthcare professional’s commanding officer (MTF/CC); and the MHS liaison
  official (MTF/CC or designee, such as the SGH) for the licensing board to contact with any
  questions or issues concerning the off-base duty assignment. The notification will also
  reference 10 U.S.C. §1094(d) and DoD 6025.13-R as underlying authority and will include a
  statement that the healthcare professional meets all qualification standards of paragraph
  4.8.1. (See Kx website C&P toolkit for notification letter template).
  4.8.3. Investigations and Reports. Refer to DoD 6025.13-R in the event of any allegation of
  misconduct on the part of the military healthcare professional arising from the healthcare
  professional’s performance of the off-base duty assignment. All individuals who are licensed
  or maintain certification or registration at the MTF must immediately notify their clinical
  supervisor and MTF senior corps representative when a Federal/state agency or facility, to
  which they are assigned off-base, is conducting an inquiry or investigation regarding their
  performance or conduct.
 56                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


                                           Chapter 5

 THE CREDENTIALING PROCESS (APPLIES TO HOSPITALS, CLINICS, AND ARC
                        MEDICAL UNITS)

Section 5A—Centralized Credentialing

5.1. AF/SG’s Vision of Centralized Credentialing. To accomplish the AF/SG’s vision of
centralized credentialing and meet the AF/SG’s goal of putting healthcare practitioners to work
as soon as possible, the AFMS has implemented a multi-factorial solution through the
establishment and implementation of the Air Force Centralized Credentials Verification Office
(AFCCVO) coupled with the use of the Centralized Credentials Quality Assurance System
(CCQAS).
5.2. Air Force Centralized Credentials Verification Office (AFCCVO). The AFCCVO is the
designated AFMS agent to be used for primary source verification (PSV) of healthcare provider
credentials and queries. The AFCCVO’s principle function is support of the credentialing and
privileging processes at AF MTFs and ARC medical units.
   5.2.1. AFMOA/SGHQ will identify credentialing and privileging requirements, develop
   implementation guidance and resolve credential verification issues as they arise.
   5.2.2. The AFCCVO will complete PSV on provider credentials and conduct appropriate
   queries for accessions and providers graduating from civilian training programs (AFIT, FAP,
   Health Professional Scholarship Program (HPSP), deferred, re-deferred, AFRC Health
   Professions Stipend Program). In addition, the AFCCVO will be the central repository for the
   PCFs/CCQAS files for providers attending AFIT and other civilian training programs and
   providers not assigned to an MTF that are in non-clinical, administrative, and special duty
   assignment positions and do not hold privileges at an MTF or medical unit.
   5.2.3. The AFCCVO enters the provider’s information into CCQAS, maintains the provider
   credentials documentation and CCQAS file until the provider receives orders to an MTF. If
   the provider is not assigned to an MTF but is in a non-clinical, administrative or special duty
   assignment, the AFCCVO maintains the file until the provider requests privileges at an
   associated MTF. Upon notification of assignment the AFCCVO will perform PSV of
   authorizing documents to practice and conduct data bank queries and forward the historical
   PCF, if applicable to the gaining MTF or ARC CM. Any credentials the AFCCVO collects or
   generates to include verifications and query results will be scanned, appropriately named, and
   uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF. Hard copy documents will be maintained in a
   temporary file for 2 years after the CCQAS record is PCSd to the MTF or unit of assignment.
   Note: The AFCCVO performs PSVs/queries on behalf of the MTF, therefore, the MTF CM
   does not re-accomplish this work. However, the MTF CM (for ANG unit: ANG CM) is
   responsible for appropriately identifying and investigating all ―red flags‖ in the
   documentation provided from the AFCCVO and in the provider’s application for
   privileges/medical staff appointment.
   5.2.4. The AFCCVO performs PSV and applicable queries upon request by the MTF or for
   ARC: RMU/MDG (new contract and civil service employees, providers PCSing to/from
   MTFs/RMUs/MDGs, or providers undergoing annual or biennial review).
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                     57


   5.2.5. During the accession process for AD and ARC providers, the AFCCVO will perform
   the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB)/Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank
   (HIPDB) queries. The NPDB/HIPDB will re-queried upon notification of accession with the
   MTF assignment before the individual is initially granted privileges. The CM will request the
   AFCCVO query the NPDB/HIPDB as part of the annual or biennial review process
   (reference paragraph 5.4.6.1.). The query results will be scanned, appropriately named and
   uploaded to the provider’s CCQAS record. The CCQAS record will be updated and if
   required, transferred (PCSd) to the MTF of assignment. The AFCCVO’s electronic query
   results will be maintained at the AFCCVO for a period of two years.
   5.2.6. The AFCCVO will process all Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) queries, if
   required. The CM will request the query be performed via CCQAS. On the
   NPDB/HIPDB/FSMB tab, in the ―FSMB Information‖ section, click the ―Request Query‖
   block (reference paragraph 5.4.6.2. to determine when it would be appropriate to request a
   FSMB query). Upon completion, the AFCCVO will update the results in CCQAS, scan and
   upload the query documentation to the provider’s electronic PCF.
   5.2.7. AFCCVO contact information is available on the AFCCVO public access website and
   on the Kx under the C&P toolkit. The AFCCVO public access WWW site at:
   http://airforcemedicine.afms.mil/afccvo contains additional information, references, and
   request forms.
5.3. Centralized Credentials Quality Assurance System (CCQAS). CCQAS is a DoD-
mandated MHS web-based, secure, worldwide provider credentialing, privileging, adverse action
and risk management application used in the provider credentialing and privileging process.
   5.3.1. The CCQAS database contains QA records created by or for the DoD, as part of the
   medical QA program. These records are confidential, privileged, and protected from
   disclosure IAW 10 U.S.C. §1102.
       5.3.1.1. The CCQAS electronic PCF will be initiated and updated IAW the CCQAS
       User’s Manual which can be found in the CCQAS ―Help‖ menu and as outlined in the
       tools available on the Kx C&P toolkit.
   5.3.2. In accordance with DoD policy the following list of healthcare providers,
   practitioners, and ancillary personnel must be included in CCQAS. Unless otherwise
   specified, the requirement applies to AD (including trainees in service programs, service-
   sponsored training, or long-term civilian schooling; anyone counting against end strength),
   reserve components, Federal civilians, civilian contractors, those providers working under
   contractual agreements within the MTF, and volunteers.
       5.3.2.1. Physicians
       5.3.2.2. Dentists
       5.3.2.3. Advanced Practice Nurses
       5.3.2.4. Physical Therapists
       5.3.2.5. Podiatrists
       5.3.2.6. Optometrists
       5.3.2.7. Clinical Dieticians
 58                                                                 AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


       5.3.2.8. Clinical Social Workers
       5.3.2.9. Pharmacists
       5.3.2.10. Clinical Psychologists
       5.3.2.11. Occupational Therapists
       5.3.2.12. Audiologists
       5.3.2.13. Speech Pathologists
       5.3.2.14. Physician Assistants
       5.3.2.15. Chiropractors
       5.3.2.16. Dental Hygienists
       5.3.2.17. Mental Health Counselors (to include CADACs)
       5.3.2.18. Professional Counselors
       5.3.2.19. Marriage and Family Therapists
       5.3.2.20. Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, Licensed Vocational Nurses
       (within timeline required by revised DoD Manual or 2 years from the date of this
       publication, whichever is earlier).
   5.3.3. The CCQAS database is web-based and accessible by MAJCOMs, AFMOA, HQ
   USAF/SG, and DoD for policy decisions. It is paramount that the information entered is
   current, complete, and accurate, and any comments entered in any ―Remarks‖ section must
   be factual, objective, and professional. CCQAS contains the provider’s electronic PCF and
   the provider may access his/her PCF.
   5.3.4. The credentials managers, AFCCVO staff, education and training and graduate
   education program office representatives are expected to ensure the data quality of
   information entered in CCQAS. When appropriate, the data contained within CCQAS and
   the PCF/training record will be reviewed and reconcile. The provider electronic PCF will be
   updated appropriately whenever there is an updated credential (i.e., training, licensure, risk
   management documents).
   5.3.5. The MTF/RMU/MDG CM will run periodic reports from CCQAS to assist the MTF
   leadership with effective management of the credentialing and privileging process and to
   ensure high data quality.

Section 5B—Provider Credentials

5.4. Documents Used in the Credentialing Process. Credentialing is the process of obtaining,
verifying, and assessing the qualifications of healthcare practitioners to provide safe patient care
services. This assessment serves as the basis for decisions regarding delineation of clinical
privileges as well as appointments and reappointments to the medical staff. The required
information should include qualification data such as relevant training and experience, current
licensure, specialty certification (if applicable) as well as performance data such as current
competence and the ability to perform privileges requested. This data is collected, verified and
assessed initially and on an ongoing basis and requires the following documents:
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                       59


  5.4.1. AF Form 1540, Application for Clinical Privileges/Medical Staff Appointment. A
  provider who does not have an approved E-application on file will be required to initially
  complete an AF Form 1540. The provider must have an approved application (either a paper
  application or the E-application) and be awarded privileges prior to initiating practice in the
  AFMS. Providers requesting privileges and medical staff appointment previously awarded
  privileges within the AFMS who are not able to complete an E-application will complete an
  AF Form 1540A, Application for Clinical Privileges/Medical Staff Appointment Update, see
  paragraph 5.4.2.
     5.4.1.1. The AF Form 1540 must be filled in completely, with no unexplained time gaps
     in work history from the date of completion of professional education/training.
     5.4.1.2. On the AF Form 1540 applicants must list all licenses and/or other authorizing
     documents and narcotics registration(s) ever held, both active and inactive. In addition,
     applicants must provide an explanation of all licenses and narcotics registrations that are
     not current, involuntarily relinquished, or subjected to disciplinary action, voluntary or
     involuntary limitation, suspension, or revocation.
     5.4.1.3. Applicants must provide explanation of any voluntary or involuntary termination
     or refusal of medical staff appointment.
     5.4.1.4. Applicants must provide explanation of any voluntary or involuntary suspension,
     restriction, or reduction on clinical privileges, including requests for privileges that have
     been denied or granted with stated limitations or restrictions.
         5.4.1.4.1. Section VIII, Question B asks, ―Have you ever had a voluntary or
         involuntary limitation, reduction, revocation, suspension, denial, or loss of clinical
         privileges?‖ This applies to both temporary and permanent actions. Note: Suspension
         is a temporary removal or restriction of all or a portion of privileges, one whose
         privileges have been suspended must answer ―yes‖ to this question. (For further
         information, refer to Chapter 9, Adverse Actions).
     5.4.1.5. Medical Malpractice Documentation. If the answer to Section VIII, Question E
     is ―yes,‖ applicants must provide written disclosure to the AFMS of their entire medical
     malpractice history and supply the following documentation:
         5.4.1.5.1. A copy of the complaint and answer, including amendments.
         5.4.1.5.2. A medical legal opinion stating the standard of care (SOC) determination,
         nature of claim, status of claim, and amount (if paid). This document must be
         obtained directly from the provider’s lawyer, the court, or the insurance company, to
         include a statement that a SOC determination does not exist if that is the case.
     5.4.1.6. Adverse Action Documentation. If there is any evidence of an adverse action
     (adverse privileging/practice, DHHS/TRICARE sanction action or a HIPDB report) at
     any healthcare facility, the applicant must supply information on that action.
     5.4.1.7. Additional information for newly accessed ARC personnel:
         5.4.1.7.1. When applicant completes Section IV, Present and Military and Civilian
         Assignments, on the AF Form 1540, he/she must include previous and current AD,
         civilian and ARC assignments.
60                                                             AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


         5.4.1.7.2. For Section VII, References, list individuals most familiar with the
         provider’s professional skills and capabilities. References may be from an
         individual’s previous MTF or a civilian facility in which he or she most recently held
         privileges or was employed.
         5.4.1.7.3. For ARC privileging issues see paragraph 6.18.
  5.4.2. AF Form 1540A, Application for Clinical Privileges/Medical Staff Appointment
  Update (if applicable). Providers requesting privileges and medical staff appointment
  previously awarded privileges within the AFMS who are not able to complete an E-
  application will complete this form at the time of reappointment or renewal of clinical
  privileges at the current MTF/RMU/MDG, or at the time of change in privileges at the
  current MTF/RMU/MDG. The applicant must review the most recent completed application,
  whether an E-application (filed in the provider’s historical 6-part PCF) or the AF Form 1540
  and complete a new AF Form 1540A as required. This form will only be used when the
  provider is unable to complete an E-application.
     5.4.2.1. The AF Form 1540A will be placed with the previously completed AF Form
     1540 and any subsequent AF Forms 1540A completed since the initial application. These
     documents become part of the permanent documentation in Section I of the PCF. This
     documentation will be scanned, named IAW the standard naming conventions, and
     uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF (see Kx C&P toolkit).
  5.4.3. Provider’s Health Status Documentation:
     5.4.3.1. An applicant completing an application (off-line or E-application) must attest to
     their health status by answering questions and providing additional remarks for any
     affirmative response.
     5.4.3.2. An applicant’s physical, mental, and emotional fitness to perform requested
     privileges must be evaluated. This is accomplished during the provider’s initial
     application for privileges and upon each annual or biennial renewal. The provider
     completes the applicable application: AF Form 1540, Section IX, Health Status, AF Form
     1540A, Section VI, or the Health Status questions in the E-application and provides
     information addressing affirmative responses. The provider may be required to provide
     additional information, e.g., a statement of diagnosis, prognosis, and implications for
     clinical performance from the primary physician treating the provider or an additional
     medical evaluation may be directed as needed.
         5.4.3.2.1. The clinical supervisor confirms the provider’s physical and mental ability
         and qualifications to perform the requested privileges. For initial privileges and
         medical staff appointment, additional documentation may be required to be able to
         confirm the provider’s health status and ability to perform the requested privileges.
         Reviewers’ recommendations for privileges/medical staff appointment in the E-
         application process are based on the provider’s health status information contained
         within the E-application. If adequate information is not available to make a
         recommendation for privileges/medical staff appointment the reviewer will return the
         application without action to enable the concern to be adequately addressed.
         5.4.3.2.2. Refer to AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management, for information on
         providers with specific infectious diseases.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                     61


  5.4.4. AF Forms 1562, Credentials Evaluation of Health Care Practitioners:
     5.4.4.1. For providers accessed from the civilian sector, two AF Forms 1562 must be
     completed. Preferably these forms are completed by the provider’s clinical supervisor and
     the chief of the medical staff. These peer references are used to document current clinical
     competency and are completed by individuals who have knowledge of the applicant’s
     clinical performance.
         5.4.4.1.1. If newly accessed providers are not a member of any hospital’s medical
         staff but are members of a group practice, equivalent individuals in the group who are
         familiar with the applicants’ practice will complete these forms.
         5.4.4.1.2. If newly accessed providers are not associated with a group practice,
         applicants must have peer providers familiar with their practice complete the AF
         Forms 1562.
         5.4.4.1.3. Letters of professional reference are acceptable in lieu of an AF Form 1562
         if the civilian evaluator adequately addresses all requested elements on the AF Form
         1562. At a minimum, this evaluation must address relevant training and experience,
         current competence, and any effects of health status on privileges being requested.
     5.4.4.2. For providers completing an AFMS training program, one AF Form 1562 must
     be completed by the training program director and forwarded to the gaining MTF, along
     with any AF Forms 494 from the training program. Program directors for the Residency
     in Aerospace Medicine (RAM) training, Pharmacy Residency and Clinical Psychology
     Residency may submit an AF Form 475 in lieu of the AF Form 494. For dental residents,
     an AF Form 475 or a letter may be submitted in lieu of AF Form 494.
     5.4.4.3. For providers completing civilian training programs, the program director and a
     senior level staff provider must each complete an AF Form 1562.
     5.4.4.4. Providers PCSing or transferring from a DoD MTF/RMU/MDG, require two AF
     Forms 1562 and the AF Form 22, Clinical Privileges Evaluation Summary. The AF Form
     22 will be completed by the clinical supervisor.
  5.4.5. Since the PSV of the credentials document is the critical component in credentialing,
  copies of the following credentials no longer need to be submitted with applications for
  privileges as long as the data regarding the credential is supplied in the AF Form 1540:
     5.4.5.1. Qualifying degree, Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates
     (ECFMG) certificate or Fifth Pathway certificate for individuals who obtained
     premedical education in the US and received undergraduate medical education abroad.
     (See Attachment 1 for detailed definitions of ECFMG and Fifth Pathway). This
     information must be PSVd as indicated in paragraph 5.5.
         5.4.5.1.1. Note: The foreign medical school degree must be PSVd with the issuing
         institution if an ECFMG certificate was issued prior to 1986 because medical school
         graduation was not verified by the ECFMG prior to that time.
     5.4.5.2. Postgraduate training certificates (i.e., internship, residency, fellowship,
     Aerospace Medicine Primary (AMP) course, or nurse anesthesia, nurse midwifery, nurse
     practitioner programs). This information must be PSVd as indicated in paragraph 5.5.
     with the following exception: Postgraduate training completed at a DoD MTF may be
62                                                                AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


     verified by review of the applicant’s military personnel record or an officer SURF from
     the Air Force Personnel Center web site, any of which must be annotated appropriately as
     described in paragraph 5.5.
     5.4.5.3. All current professional licenses, registrations, and certifications, as well as ones
     the provider previously held that are now inactive, expired, and/or suspended. These
     documents must be PSVd.
        5.4.5.3.1. The AFCCVO, on behalf of the MTF/RMU/MDG, must PSV (as indicated
        in paragraph 5.5.) the license/certification/registration at the time of appointment,
        initial granting of clinical privileges, at reappointment or renewal or any revision of
        clinical privileges, and at the time of license/certification/registration expiration.
     5.4.5.4. Specialty board certificates upon certification and recertification, if applicable.
     This information must be PSVd as indicated in paragraph 5.5. See paragraph 5.7.1. for
     additional information on verification of specialty board recertification.
     5.4.5.5. State Controlled Substance Registration (CRS), if applicable. This information
     must be PSVd as indicated in paragraph 5.5.
     5.4.5.6. Emergency Resuscitation Training Documentation. Resuscitation training
     requirements for personnel involved in direct patient care are outlined in AFI 44-102.
     5.4.5.7. Continuing Health Education (CHE) Documentation. Continuing education is an
     adjunct to maintaining clinical skills and current competence. Therefore, all providers
     must participate and produce evidence of accumulated CHE at initial appointment and at
     least 60 days prior to reappointment. For specific continuing education requirements,
     refer to AFI 41-117. Note: CHE that results in awarding specific privileges or that
     constitutes ―Additional Qualifying Training‖ must be PSVd (e.g., Aerospace Medicine
     Primary course; conscious sedation training). Documentation of the PSV of the CHE
     upon which privileges are awarded will be scanned, named IAW standard naming
     conventions and uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF. An entry is also required
     within CCQAS under the post graduate training tab.
     5.4.5.8. Prior Clinical Privileges Lists.
        5.4.5.8.1. The AFRS (for military accessions) and the MTF (for civilian accessions)
        will obtain copies of privileges awarded by the healthcare facility where the
        provider’s most recent practice took place. For providers coming directly from a
        training program, applicable AF clinical privileges forms completed by the training
        program clinical supervisor meet this requirement. These forms reflect what the
        training program clinical supervisor deemed the applicant is qualified to perform.
        (See Attachment 1 for list of available clinical privileging forms).
        5.4.5.8.2. For newly accessed providers from civilian practice, if the provider had
        privileges for less than one year at the prior healthcare facility, then privileges need to
        be obtained from another healthcare facility where the provider practiced prior to that
        year, if applicable. If the provider does not hold privileges at a healthcare facility,
        he/she must provide an applicable AF clinical privileges form completed by a peer
        familiar with the applicant’s clinical practice. An applicant who is in private practice
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                      63


         and is not privileged at a civilian facility is required to submit a memorandum stating
         this fact.
         5.4.5.8.3. Privileges for ARC personnel are based, in part, upon the applicant’s
         civilian practice. A copy of the privileges lists from all current places of civilian
         practice must be provided. If the provider is in private practice and has no privileges
         or medical staff appointment with any civilian institution, a memorandum from the
         provider stating this fact must be provided.
     5.4.5.9. Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) Documentation:
         5.4.5.9.1. For those MTFs who offer mammography services, radiologists will abide
         by MQSA requirements and submit appropriate documentation (refer to Department
         of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, 21 CFR, Part 900,
         Quality Mammography Standards, Final Rule; published in the Federal Register, Vol.
         62, No. 208, Tuesday, October 28, 1997, effective 28 Apr 99). Written documentation
         that the provider meets MQSA requirements will be filed in Section VI of the PCF
         prior to the provider completing an E-application. Once the provider completes an E-
         application this documentation will be scanned, named IAW standard naming
         conventions, and uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF (see Kx C&P toolkit).
         The Federal Register regulation, as well as guidance documents, can be obtained from
         the                 following                 website:http://www.fda.gov/Radiation-
         EmittingProducts/MammographyQualityStandardsActand Program.
     5.4.5.10. National Provider Identifier (NPI) Registration. The NPI is a unique health
     identifier for healthcare providers. This will be required for all privileged providers,
     residents, IDMTs and clinical nurses providing billable services (reference paragraph
     6.40. for application process/ additional information).
     5.4.5.11. Any Federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration(s) and/or
     the DoD fee-exempt DEA original certificate (reference paragraph 6.41.). Fee-exempt
     DEAs are issued to physicians, dentists, podiatrists, optometrist, and prescribing
     psychologists. Physician assistants and advanced practice nurses who hold a state license
     as a mid-level practitioner are also eligible for a fee-exempt DEA. See Kx C&P toolkit
     for the latest DEA guidance for issuance of fee-exempt DEAs.
  5.4.6. Data Bank Queries:
     5.4.6.1. NPDB/HIPDB Queries. NPDB/HIPDB queries will be made by the AFCCVO
     on behalf of the MTF/RMU/MDG (reference paragraph 5.2.5.) at the time of initial
     medical staff appointment, initial granting of clinical privileges, renewal of privileges or
     when expanding privileges or requesting to add new privileges. There may be other
     circumstances in which it would be appropriate to query the NPDB/HIPDB.
     5.4.6.2. FSMB Queries. Effective 1 May 04, FSMB queries are only required one time
     for physicians or physician assistants with a practice history prior to 1 Jan 95. This
     change is due to the redundancy of information contained in the NPDB and extremely
     low positive FSMB query results obtained. If there is a question concerning a provider’s
     clinical practice history, an FSMB query may be requested through the AFCCVO
     (reference paragraph 5.2.6.).
64                                                              AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


     5.4.6.3. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and TRICARE Sanction
     Provider Listings. DHHS maintains sanction authority on behalf of government agencies
     (32 C.F.R.) and maintains the listing of providers who have been sanctioned (reference
     sanction listing at http:// exclusions.oig.hhs.gov/). TRICARE may initiate its own
     sanction action against a provider and maintains a list of sanctioned providers located on
     the following website: www.tricare.osd.mil/ fraud. It is important to review both the
     DHHS and TRICARE listings to identify sanctioned providers who have entered into
     contracts or are applying for employment (accessions, civil service, etc.) with the AFMS.
     Paying funds to a sanctioned provider is against federal law and carries serious penalties
     and fines.
         5.4.6.3.1. When a company is hired to provide healthcare providers, whether under a
         non-personal or personal service contract, the company is required to perform the
         appropriate sanction checks prior to presenting an otherwise qualified candidate. The
         company will provide the website printout of the query results annotated IAW para
         5.5.4.7. The MTF/RMU/MDG CM will scan the query results, name IAW standard
         naming conventions, and upload the documents to the provider’s electronic PCF (see
         Kx C&P toolkit).
         5.4.6.3.2. AFCCVO will query the listings for accessions, providers graduating from
         out-of-service training programs, and other providers at the MTF/RMU/MDG
         request. The query results will be scanned, named IAW standard naming conventions,
         and uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF (see Kx C&P toolkit).
         5.4.6.3.3. The MTF/RMU/MDG is responsible to review these exclusion lists to
         ensure there is not a sanction against any provider seeking employment through
         federal government service. The website printout of the query results will be
         annotated IAW para 5.5.4.7, scanned, named IAW standard naming conventions and
         uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF (see Kx C&P toolkit).
     5.4.6.4. Defense Practitioner Data Bank (DPDB) Queries. AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk
     Management Operations, will upload the document indicating a positive DPDB report to
     the provider’s credentials record under Document tab File type ―DPDB Report‖ as
     outlined in the document naming convention (see KX C&P toolkit). The AFCCVO (if E-
     application was routed to the CVO for PSV) or the MTF/RMU/MDG CM will review the
     provider’s documents within CCQAS to identify whether a positive DPDB query is
     entered. The AFCCVO (if application routed to the CVO for PSV) or the
     MTF/RMU/MDG CM will enter a comment under the Comments tab in the provider’s E-
     application to indicate: ―No DPDB report on file in the document section‖ or ―DPDB
     report on file, see document section for additional information.‖ The query will be
     performed at the time of privileging (if the provider has previously been privileged within
     a DoD MTF/RMU/MDG) and renewal of privileges (IAW DoD 6025.13-R), any positive
     results will be considered, as part of the provider’s application during the privileging
     process. Types of reports generated by the DPDB queries include Ferres Barred,
     malpractice reports, and disability awards when associated with medical negligence.
  5.4.7. Criminal History Background Checks (CHBC). CHBCs are required for all contract
  and volunteer providers caring for children under the age of 18 on a ―frequent and regular‖
  basis. The AFMS defines frequent and regular as patient workload of greater than 20% under
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                    65


  the age of 18 based on empanelled population or historical clinical information. Those
  contract or volunteer providers working in emergency services will be required to have
  CHBCs regardless of patient workload percentages. AD, ARC, and civil service providers do
  not require a CHBC, since background checks are completed on these providers prior to
  accession. CHBCs are based on fingerprints obtained by a government law enforcement
  officer, as well as inquiries conducted through the Federal Bureau of Investigation and State
  Criminal History Repositories.
     5.4.7.1. For non-personal service contract personnel, the contractor is responsible for
     initiating the Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry and completing the state criminal
     history inquiry portion of the CHBC. For personal service contract and volunteer
     personnel, the MTF security manager is responsible for initiating and completing the
     CHBCs. The MTF CM coordinates with the security manager to track the status and
     completion of the CHBC. For further information, reference DoDI 1402.5, Criminal
     History Background Checks on Individuals in Child Care Services.
     5.4.7.2. The original or certified copy of the final results of the CHBC is required and
     must be kept in the PCF for the life of the contract.
     5.4.7.3. CHBCs must be revalidated every 5 years. The revalidation consists of the
     installation records check and the Defense Central Investigative Index name check and
     covers the time period since the completion of the last background check.
     5.4.7.4. CHBCs are to go back as far as possible, to age 18.
     5.4.7.5. If there has been a break in government service, a complete CHBC must be re-
     accomplished, even if the individual has had a security clearance and/or recent CHBC.
     5.4.7.6. Per DoD guidance, pending the completion of the CHBC, the AF/SG requires
     the privileged provider to have close clinical supervision. The MTF/CC will determine
     what constitutes ―close clinical supervision.‖
     5.4.7.7. The MTF/CC (for ARC: RMU/CC or MDG/CC) may request a CHBC on any
     personnel in their command at his/her discretion.
  5.4.8. Utilizing the ICTB in Lieu of AF Form 1540. The ICTB facilitates transfer of
  credentials used by the receiving facility/deployed locations when privileged providers are
  assigned for temporary duty. The sending MTF/RMU/MDG conveys pertinent credentials
  and privileging information to the gaining MTF/RMU/MDG.
     5.4.8.1. CCQAS Transfer (ICTB) E-application. The CCQAS Transfer (ICTB) E-
     application will be utilized for those providers being sent via ICTB to another DoD
     MTF/RMU/MDG. (Refer to CCQAS User’s Guide for additional information).
         5.4.8.1.1. For routine TDY, annual training, or manning assistance, the ICTB must
         be initiated in CCQAS and the provider must submit their Transfer (ICTB) E-
         application requesting privileges at the gaining MTF/RMU/MDG at least 60 days in
         advance, whenever possible. ARC entities will scan, appropriately name and upload
         to the provider’s electronic PCF the current military and civilian clinical privileges
         lists (see KX C&P toolkit).
         5.4.8.1.2. For ongoing, recurrent TDYs, unless the privileges at the sending
         MTF/RMU/MDG expire or are modified, it is not necessary to generate a new
 66                                                                 AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


           ICTB/AF Form 22/AF Form 1562 for each TDY. The period of the ICTB expiration
           should be concurrent with the privileges/medical staff appointment expiration at the
           sending MTF/RMU/MDG.
           5.4.8.1.3. Upon Conclusion of the CCQAS Transfer (ICTB) E-application. The TDY
           location will obtain a performance evaluation (i.e., AF Form 22 or 1562) and scan,
           appropriately name and upload to the provider’s electronic PCF. This includes ANG
           providers who are returning from Annual Training or other TDY missions at AD
           MTF locations, e.g. ANG CRTCs, etc.
       5.4.8.2. Hard Copy ICTB. Providers going on a temporary clinical assignment at a non-
       privileging UIC (i.e., deployed using ―DEPLOYED‖ UIC or humanitarian mission using
       ―HUMANITY‖ UIC) or to a Veterans Administration (VA) facility will require the
       generation of a hard copy ICTB. To initiate the hard copy ICTB within CCQAS, use the
       generate ICTB button to create the ICTB letter. Note: A CCQAS Transfer (ICTB) E-
       application is not generated or required. The hard copy ICTB package includes the ICTB
       letter, a copy of the provider’s current clinical privileges list(s), and a blank performance
       evaluation form (i.e., AF Form 22 or 1562).
           5.4.8.2.1. The sending MTF/CC, ARC privileging authority, or designee must sign
           the ICTB.
           5.4.8.2.2. For routine TDY, annual training, or manning assistance, the Transfer
           (ICTB) E-application should be completed by the provider and submitted to the
           gaining MTF at least 60 days in advance, whenever possible. ARC entities will
           include current military and civilian clinical privileges lists and via the ICTB e-
           Application the new privileges list prepared by the involved provider to reflect
           requested privileges at the gaining facility. The supporting documentation should be
           scanned, appropriately named and uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF. If the
           provider has an approved E-application on file, the approved privileges may be
           downloaded from the privileges tab within the CRED record.
           5.4.8.2.3. Any hard-copy ICTB initiated after the provider has completed an E-
           application will be scanned, appropriately named and uploaded to the electronic
           provider’s credentials file. If the provider has not completed an E-application,
           maintain a copy of the hard copy ICTB in Section V of the PCF. When possible,
           obtain a performance assessment for the TDY period (i.e., AF Form 22 or 1562).
           Maintain the AF Form 22 or AF Form 1562 completed by the TDY location in
           Section II of the PCF for the biennial period. The performance assessment should be
           scanned, appropriately named and uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF.

Section 5C—Verification of Credentials

5.5. Primary Source Verification (PSV). Primary source is defined as the original source of a
specific credential that can verify the accuracy of a qualification reported by a practitioner or
licensed individual. PSV is required for clinical staff required by the organization or state to have
a license, registration, or certification. Examples include medical school (for qualifying degree),
graduate medical education program (for residency training), and state medical board (for
license). A reasonable effort must be made to verify, with the primary issuing authority, all
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        67


documents identified in Section 5B as requiring PSV. Documents can be verified by one of the
following methods: written verification, verbal via telephone, by obtaining an American Medical
Association (AMA) Master file, American Osteopathic Association (AOA) Master file, World
Wide Web, and, least preferred, touchtone telephone verification. The ―chain of transmission‖ of
the document or information is what distinguishes PSV from secondary source verification. The
document or information must come directly from the issuing authority to be considered a PSV.
Documents delivered and/or provided directly from the practitioner still require PSV. Copies of
diplomas, certificates, licenses, etc. are NOT considered PSV, even if one personally makes the
copy from the original document. Note: A reasonable attempt to PSV the document is defined as
making a second attempt to solicit the necessary information. If still unsuccessful, annotate the
effort, file documentation in Section VI of the PCF, and identify the problem to the MTF SGH or
ARC privileging authority.
   5.5.1. Written Confirmation from the Issuing Authority. For current credentials this
   confirmation is scanned, named IAW standard naming conventions, and uploaded to the
   provider’s electronic PCF (See Kx C&P toolkit). In the case of qualifying degrees, certified
   copies of the final college transcripts are acceptable if the type of degree and the date it was
   conferred are included on the transcript and the document came directly from the issuing
   authority. Reviewing a certified or raised seal copy of the final college transcript submitted
   by the provider is unacceptable and not considered PSV.
   5.5.2. Verbal Telephone Confirmation from the Issuing Authority. This confirmation must
   be annotated on the copy of the document being verified or on a separate memorandum, and
   scanned, named IAW standard naming conventions, and uploaded to the provider’s
   electronic PCF (see Kx C&P toolkit). The documentation of the verification will be filed in
   Section VI of the pre-existing hard copy PCF or if there is not a hard-copy PCF, a provider
   specific folder to hold transitory/temporary credentialing documents. The verification
   annotation will indicate the date of the conversation, agency contacted for the verification,
   agency phone number, name and title of the individual at the agency who verified the
   information, the specific information provided, and the signature and signature block of the
   person who performed the verification. The signature block of the person requesting
   verification will include full name, title, and organizational address and phone number.
   5.5.3. The following are considered designated equivalent primary verifications sources:
       5.5.3.1. The American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Master file may be used
       for PSV of US medical school graduation and US residency program completion. For
       further information and guidance in obtaining an access code, call 1-800-665-2882 or
       access information on-line at http://www.ama-assn.org. There is a fee per profile for
       each of these services. To maximize savings to the AFMS, the AFCCVO will conduct
       this verification when required.
       5.5.3.2. The AOA Master file may be used as PSV for US medical school and US
       residency program completions for osteopathic physicians. The commercial telephone
       number for the AOA is 1-800-621-1773, extension 8145. There is a fee per profile for
       each of these services. To maximize savings to the AFMS the AFCCVO will conduct this
       verification when required.
       5.5.3.3. The Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) for
       verification of physician’s graduation from a foreign medical school. (Refer to paragraph
68                                                             AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


     5.4.5.1. and ECFMG in Attachment 1, Terms for a detailed definition.) To maximize
     savings to the AFMS the AFCCVO will conduct this verification when required.
  5.5.4. Internet or WWW Verifications. The use of a professional organization’s WWW site
  is permitted for PSV of credentials by a healthcare organization (HCO) or its contracted
  Credentials Verification Organization (CVO) if:
     5.5.4.1. The information is obtained directly from the professional organization’s WWW
     site. Use of the WWW site of another recognized professional organization is permitted if
     it is used as the platform to reach the intended site. The HCO and, when applicable it’s
     CVO, must confirm the WWW site used is the professional organization’s official WWW
     site.
     5.5.4.2. The HCO and, when applicable its CVO, will assure itself that the source WWW
     site, when not located at, and under the direct control of, the professional organization,
     receives its information directly from the professional organization’s database through
     encrypted transmission. When the source WWW site is located at, and is under the
     control of, the professional organization, the HCO and, when applicable it’s CVO, should
     assure itself that if the WWW site does not receive its information from the database by
     encrypted transmission, it is protected from alteration by unauthorized individuals.
     5.5.4.3. The information on the WWW site contains all of the information required for
     the PSV process of the specific credential, to include, sufficient information to properly
     identify the applicant. For example, name alone might not be sufficient to distinguish the
     applicant.
     5.5.4.4. The HCO and, when applicable it’s CVO, must know the currency of
     information on the WWW site. Information on the WWW site that is supplemental to the
     information undergoing PSV, such as a state licensing board’s WWW site including
     information on the individual’s specialty, is not to be used as PSV data, although it may
     be useful in evaluating the overall package of information gathered by the HCO on the
     practitioner.
     5.5.4.5. Any discrepancy between information provided by the applicant and that on the
     WWW site must be followed up with the professional organization by correspondence or
     telephone.
     5.5.4.6. The fact that adverse information is not presented on the WWW site does not
     deter the HCO from contacting the professional organization by telephone or written
     correspondence if the other information gathered by the HCO warrants it or if there is a
     discrepancy between what the applicant provided and the information on the WWW site.
     5.5.4.7. The signature block of the person completing verification, along with the date,
     will be placed on the WWW site printout or other record of information and will include
     the individual’s full name, title, and organizational address and phone number. If the
     HCO uses a CVO that gathers information directly from a professional organization’s
     WWW site, they must ensure that the CVO identifies the employee who made the WWW
     site contact and gathered the information along with the date of that action. If that
     information is in turn transmitted electronically to the HCO, the HCO must also identify
     the medical staff specialist who gathered the information from the CVO, along with the
     date.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                       69


   5.5.5. Touchtone Telephone PSV. Touchtone telephone PSV (in which the caller does not
   speak with an actual person; instead, electronically accesses a database) is acceptable only if
   the other methods listed above are not possible and must be annotated as such. Follow the
   procedures outlined in paragraph 5.5.2. for specific guidance and procedures.
5.6. Credential Document Authentication. Annotating authentication true and valid copy of a
credentialing document is not an acceptable method of PSV.
5.7. Actions Following Initial Verification. As long as the provider is continually employed
by the DoD, the following apply:
   5.7.1. Licenses, registrations, certifications must be re-verified as described in paragraph
   5.4.5.3.1. Specialty board certifications with expiration dates must be re-verified (PSV) at
   time of reissue. Specialty boards that have implemented new certification standards which
   specify that ongoing certification with the board is contingent upon meeting the requirements
   of Maintenance of Certification (MOC) will require annual re-verification as outlined by the
   respective board (see Kx C&P toolkit for additional information). Once a diplomate’s
   current, time-limited board certification expires, these individuals will enroll in MOC and
   successfully complete requirements to maintain certification.
   5.7.2. Credentials which do not expire or require reissue, such as qualifying degree, do not
   need to be re-verified as long as the practitioner is continually employed by the DoD.
5.8. Inability to Obtain Necessary Credentials PSV. Inability to obtain necessary credential
verification will be considered when recommending the award of privileges and may result in a
modification of privileges or failure to award privileges. Note: If unable to obtain verification
due to destruction of original documents by fire or natural disaster, annotate the reason the PSV
could not be completed and attempt to at least secondary source verify the information.
5.9. Foreign language (excluding Latin) documents must be translated into
English. ECFMG documents that are from 1985 or earlier must be translated into English and
the qualifying foreign medical degree must be PSVd with the issuing institution. The only
exception is if the qualifying foreign medical degree is from 1986 or later because the ECFMG
PSVs these documents.
5.10. Verification of Board Certification. Specialty board certificates will be PSVd. This can
be done directly with the certifying board or by using one of the approved sources:
   5.10.1. For the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), the following are identified
   and approved as the designated ―official‖ display agents for Board Certification: CertiFACTs
   Online, Elsevier BoardCertifiedDocs and supporting physician data file, and the AMA
   Physician Profile and AMA Master File. Therefore, the ABMS Board Certification
   information provided by these entities are considered a designated equivalent source in
   regard to credentialing standards set forth by accrediting bodies such as the TJC. (Reference
   www.abms.org/bcdata.asp).
       5.10.1.1. MTFs will use the AFCCVO services to fully utilize the AFMS subscription for
       verification of board certification.
       5.10.1.2. According to ABMS, the official ABMS Directory of Board Certified Medical
       Specialists, 37th edition and subsequent print editions will no longer be used for PSV for
 70                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


       credentialing purposes. The ABMS Medical Specialists PLUS CD-ROM was phased out
       in June 2005 for PSV purposes.
       5.10.1.3. According to AOA, the Official Osteopathic Physician Profile Report is
       recognized as providing primary source information on AOA board certifications and
       replaces the Physician Certification Verification Letter and AOA Directory Information
       as official sources for osteopathic physician credentials. (Reference: https://secure.aoa-
       net.org/webprof)
       5.10.1.4. Verifications through ABMS or AOA apply only to those specialty boards that
       are members of the ABMS or AOA. Certification by non-ABMS or AOA boards must be
       verified directly with the respective board. Reference AFI 41-104, Professional Board
       and National Certification Examinations, for listing of approved certifying agencies.
   5.10.2. It is not necessary to delay the award of privileges pending verification of board
   certification, because board certification is not an AFMS requirement for privileging.

Section 5D—AFRS, AFPC/DPAM, and AFMS Postgraduate Training Program Director
Responsibilities for Credentials Documentation

5.11. Provider Accessions through the Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS). Recruiting
personnel will utilize the services of the AFCCVO for PSV of required credentials and to
perform required queries used in the selection process. The AFRS will assemble the required
credentials documents/forms and information as described in paragraphs 5.4. through 5.4.5.11.
The AFRS will then forward all documents to the AFCCVO for processing (see 5.2.7. for contact
information). The AFCCVO enters the provider into CCQAS, performs the PSV of the required
credentials, conducts required queries, and sends a summary report to AFRS. Any red flags
found in the verification and query process must be brought to the attention of AFRS for future
investigation and appropriate clearance. Upon notification of accession and receipt of orders, the
AFCCVO re-PSVs the license, repeats the applicable queries, updates the verifications in
CCQAS and then forwards the CCQAS record electronically to the gaining unit [PCS to gaining
MTF/RMU/MDG Unit Identification Code (UIC)] no earlier than 60 days and at least 15 days
prior to the provider’s report not-later-than date, when date of notification of accession and
assignment allows. See para 5.2.3. for disposition of credentials/forms at the AFCCVO. See
Credentials Table A5.1. in Attachment 5. See 5.21. for non-privileged medical professional
NPDB/HIPDB queries.
   5.11.1. The ARC accession credential requirements are the same as outlined in paragraph
   5.4. This includes Reserve providers participating in the Health Professions Stipend Program
   (see paragraph 5.2.2.). EXCEPTION: The ANG unit will forward the results of the
   AFCCVO’s credentials verifications/queries and the accession package to state’s ―The
   Adjutant General‖ (TAG) office. Copies of credentials documents will be maintained by the
   unit CM and will not be forwarded with the initial package.
5.12. Providers Attending Air Force Postgraduate Education Programs.
   5.12.1. The director of medical education at the MTF that provides training for an individual
   will create and maintain a resident medical training record (as outlined in AFI 41-117) and a
   CCQAS record at the initiation and throughout the duration of training.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                         71


       5.12.1.1. PSVd copies of all applicable credentialing documents will be scanned,
       appropriately named and uploaded into the provider’s electronic PCF.
   5.12.2. When training is completed, the director of medical education at the MTF prepares a
   final evaluation as outlined in AFI 41-117. The following completed documentation will be
   scanned, appropriately named and uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF:
       5.12.2.1. AF Form 1562, Credentials Evaluation of Health Care Practitioners.
       5.12.2.2. AF Form 494, Academic/Clinical Evaluation Report. AF Form 494 is
       completed for physicians by the training program director. Program directors for the
       Residency in Aerospace Medicine (RAM) training may submit an AF Form 475,
       Education/Training Report, in lieu of an AF Form 494. For dental residents and allied
       health programs, an AF Form 475 or a letter may be submitted in lieu of AF Form 494.
       Note: AF Form 475s will be completed for graduating students IAW AFI 36-2406,
       Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems.
       5.12.2.3. Annotated clinical privileges forms. The training program director will indicate
       the student’s ability to perform treatments and procedures by annotating the appropriate
       code in the ―Verified‖ column of the applicable hard copy AF clinical privileges list and
       sign the clinical supervisor block.
       5.12.2.4. An original signed verification (i.e., memorandum, letter, or other document to
       serve as PSV) of successful training program completion. This includes verification for
       those persons completing first post-graduate year (PGY-1) training.
   5.12.3. Following training program completion the credentials, verifications and other
   documents cited above remain at the training institution as part of the medical education file.
   The applicable scanned documents are uploaded to the electronic provider’s credentials file
   and are utilized in the credentialing and privileging process when the provider transfers to a
   new duty assignment.
   5.12.4. The training program director or his/her designee at the losing training site will scan,
   appropriately name and upload the required credentials (which includes documentation of
   PSVs and credentials documents) to the provider’s electronic PCF and transfer the CCQAS
   record to the gaining facility. If there is a pre-existing hard copy PCF (if trainee maintained a
   PCF at a DoD MTF prior to attending training program) it will be transferred to the CM at
   the gaining MTF by certified or express mail to arrive no later than 15 days before the
   provider’s report not-later-than date.
   5.12.5. Reference Credentials Table A5.2. in Attachment 5 for summary of training program
   responsibilities in collection and verification of credentials.
   5.12.6. The training program office will maintain copies of applicable credentialing
   documents IAW AFI 41-117.
5.13. Deferred Providers Attending Residency, Fellowship, or Other Long-Term Graduate
or Other Medical Education Programs in Residence at Civilian Medical
Facilities. Recruiting Service has no further contact with providers who are recruited and then
placed in deferred status to attend civilian training. Guidance concerning graduate education,
licensure, and PSV of graduation from basic educational program is provided by HQ
AFPC/DPAM. See Credentials Table A5.3. in Attachment 5.
 72                                                                AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   5.13.1. Providers in residency programs will be licensed as described in paragraphs 4.4.1.
   through 4.4.1.1.
   5.13.2. AFCCVO will provide an AF Form 1540, two AF Forms 1562, and the appropriate
   clinical privileges form(s) to providers for completion. At completion of training, the
   AFCCVO will PSV credentials IAW paragraph 5.5. and verify proper completion of all
   forms. The AFCCVO will then scan, appropriately name and upload copies of licenses,
   certificate(s) of residency completion, AF Form 1540, two AF Forms 1562, clinical
   privileges form(s), and other credentials documents, to the provider’s electronic PCF no later
   than 15 days prior to report not-later-than date. See Credentials Table A5.3. in Attachment 5.

Section 5E—Provider Credentials File (PCF)

5.14. Electronic PCF. Effective upon the publication of this AFI, the official PCF for a
provider who has been privileged within the AFMS will be the CCQAS record and will be
referred to as an electronic PCF. The 6-part hard-copy PCF will become a historical file only and
the electronic PCF will be subject to compliance inspections. For newly assigned providers
without a historic PCF, a temporary credentials file will be established at the local
MTF/RMU/MDG to store documentation that has been collected at that site. This documentation
must be scanned, appropriately named and uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF upon
receipt, as the electronic CCQAS record is the provider’s official credentials file. The temporary
file is not subject to compliance inspections but serves as a repository of historical documents if
needed in the future. A printed copy of the provider’s current approved E-application will be
maintained in the temporary file in case of inaccessibility of the CCQAS web site. If the provider
is unable to complete an E-application, the approved off-line application for privileges and
medical staff appointment must be scanned, appropriately named and uploaded to the electronic
PCF.
5.15. Handling of the PCF. The Privacy Act of 1974 (as implemented by AFI 33-332, Air
Force Privacy Act Program); 10 U.S.C. §1102; and DoD 6025.13-R govern access and release
of information in PCFs, the temporary file and any provider information from the CCQAS
database.
   5.15.1. The cover of all historical PCFs and any temporary credentials file must contain the
   following two statements: 1) ―Privacy Act of 1974 governs access to this file,‖ and 2) ―This
   is a Quality Assurance document protected from release by Federal Law, 10 U.S.C. §1102.‖
   5.15.2. Historical Hard Copy PCFs and the temporary credentials file will be maintained in a
   secure manner. Providers may review their files, but they may not remove them from the
   control of the CM. Refer to the Kx C&P Toolkit for historical information on the contents of
   the PCF. The provider’s electronic PCF has replaced the hard copy 6-part PCF. Any
   previously established 6-part PCF folders are now maintained and transferred for historical
   purposes only.
5.16. Maintenance of ARC Electronic PCFs. In addition to paragraph 5.14., the following
apply to the ARC:
   5.16.1. Each ARC medical unit commander will appoint, in writing, an officer and/or senior
   non-commissioned officer as the credentials manager/liaison. They should also appoint an
   assistant credentials manager/liaison.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                         73


   5.16.2. The electronic PCF is established and maintained by the MTF CM if collocated and
   at the ARC medical unit of assignment if non-collocated. For IMA reservists the electronic
   PCF is maintained at the unit of attachment. For ARC collocated providers, the electronic
   PCF is maintained by the AD host MTF; however, the ARC CM/liaison will have
   management oversight within CCQAS of the ARC providers for military related duties. The
   privileging authority lies with the location of the electronic PCF. If the provider is working as
   a civilian provider in an AD facility, the AD facility CM will contact the ARC unit and
   determine who will maintain the primary CRED record within CCQAS. An ICTB record will
   be created for the other facility/unit. In this situation the ICTB record provides a mechanism
   within CCQAS to share and track credentials and is used due to the current limitations of
   CCQAS.
      5.16.2.1. ANG medical units collocated with AD MTFs should establish credentialing
      and privileging responsibilities with the MTF Credentials Function via a MOU or HTSA.
      Otherwise, the ANG medical unit will maintain the unit providers’ credentials files and
      grant appropriate privileges.
   5.16.3. Non-collocated ARC medical units will maintain their assigned providers’ electronic
   PCF.
   5.16.4. The host MTF of a geographically separated medical reserve unit will maintain the
   AFRC providers’ electronic PCFs.
   5.16.5. For ARC SMEs and Rapid Engineers Deployable Heavy Operational Repair
   Squadrons Engineer (RED HORSE) units, the electronic PCF is maintained by the host
   medical unit.
   5.16.6. The credentials liaison for the collocated ARC medical units will act as liaison
   between the AD MTF and the ARC medical unit to ensure appropriate PCF documentation is
   provided (reference paragraphs 5.4. through 5.4.5.11.).
      5.16.6.1. The ARC medical unit CC, SGH (or equivalent), unit credentials liaison and
      provider are responsible for forwarding all required credentials necessary to prepare the
      electronic PCF for the privileging process to the active duty MTF CM.
      5.16.6.2. All supporting credentialing documentation for renewals must be submitted to
      the MTF/RMU/MDG CM at least 90 days prior to the privileging expiration date. This
      includes: AF Forms 22s and/or 1562s, civilian privileges lists or memorandum for record
      if the provider does not have civilian privileges and any CHEs documentation that has not
      been previously provided to the CM.
   5.16.7. The AD MTF unit of attachment for Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs)
   and Participating Individual Ready Reserve (PIRR) providers will create and maintain the
   assigned provider’s electronic PCF.

Section 5F—Disposition of PCFs/CCQAS Records and Provider Activity Files (PAFs)

5.17. Disposition of Active PCFs/CCQAS Records When Providers Transfer.
   5.17.1. The losing medical unit will complete a data quality review of the electronic PCF
   ensuring the minimum documents for an E-application are scanned, named IAW standard
   naming conventions, and uploaded (see Kx C&P toolkit). The historical hard copy PCF will
 74                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   be sent by registered, certified or any other accountable mailing source to the gaining
   medical unit to arrive not later than 30 days before the provider’s reporting date, when
   possible. This also applies to providers approved for inter-service transfers. The losing
   medical unit CM will assist the provider in completing the transfer E-application if required.
   The temporary credentials file will be retained at the losing MTF/RMU/MDG for a period of
   two years as it contains copies of documentation that has been scanned, appropriately named
   and uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF.
   5.17.2. When a provider is reassigned, the SGH or ARC physician designee or clinical
   supervisor, and one peer at the losing MTF each complete a separate AF Form 1562 and the
   clinical supervisor completes an AF Form 22 as described in paragraph 5.4.4.4. The losing
   MTF CMs will scan, name IAW standard naming conventions and upload to the provider’s
   electronic PCF. The hard copy forms (AF Forms 1562s and 22s) will be included in the
   historical PCF.
   5.17.3. Providers not assigned to an MTF that are working in administrative positions (i.e.,
   HQ USAF, HQ MAJCOMs, or other staff positions) that do not request privileges at a nearby
   MTF and those providers attending either AFIT-sponsored or non-sponsored (deferred/re-
   deferred) civilian training programs will have their historical PCFs and electronic PCF
   maintained by the AFCCVO. The historical PCF file is sent by an accountable mailing
   source and the provider’s electronic PCF is transferred to the AFCCVO no later than 30 days
   after the provider’s departure. For providers in re-deferred status include a copy of the
   separation orders in the provider documentation sent to the AFCCVO. Once received the
   AFCCVO becomes responsible for maintaining the PCFs for the duration of provider’s
   assignment or if provider applies for privileges, the PCFs are forwarded to the requesting
   MTF/RMU/MDG.
   5.17.4. For providers in administrative positions and those entering re-deferred civilian
   training programs the provider’s electronic PCF is transferred to the AFCCVO Unit
   Identification Code (UIC). For providers attending AFIT-sponsored civilian training
   programs the provider’s electronic PCF is transferred to the AFIT ―WE0JF66J‖ UIC. Note:
   The AFCCVO manages both the CCQAS AFCCVO and AFIT UICs. The losing MTF CM
   notifies the provider of record location.
   5.17.5. Historical and electronic PCFs for providers in military post graduate training
   programs associated with an MTF will be sent to the MTF-specific training program office
   and the appropriate GME UIC (refer to paragraph 5.12. for specific guidance and
   responsibilities). See the Kx C&P toolkit for additional information.
   5.17.6. The provider is responsible to provide licensure, registration, certification, CHE, and
   BLS/ACLS/ATLS recertification updates to the appropriate office managing their electronic
   PCF.
5.18. Disposition of Inactive PCFs, CCQAS Records, and PAFs.
   5.18.1. Medical units will maintain inactive PCFs of retired or separated providers IAW the
   Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), Table 44-7, Rules 3 and 4, in the Air Force
   Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). The AF RDS is available on-line at
   https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                     75


   5.18.2. Disposition of the PCF when providers leave employment. When a provider
   separates, retires, or terminates employment, contractual, or volunteer services, the
   MTF/RMU maintains his or her PCF as described above. The CCQAS record is deactivated
   and the clinical supervisor completes a final AF Form 22 to be placed in the provider’s
   electronic PCF.
      5.18.2.1. If a provider is offered and accepts employment at the same MTF within 30
      days, any appropriate privileges awarded during the original privileging period prior to
      the change in status will automatically continue for the duration of that original
      privileging period without need for renewal. It may be appropriate to change the
      provider’s medical staff appointment if the provider is no longer working full time at the
      MTF. This continuation of awarded privileges also applies to contract providers already
      privileged by the MTF when the contract ends and the provider is re-hired under a new
      contract and returns to work in the MTF without more than a 30 day gap. However, for
      all types of providers, if there is any interim clinical employment outside the MTF, CMs
      must obtain a letter of recommendation from the interim employer. Should the letter of
      recommendation contain cautionary information about the provider, that information may
      be used as a basis for further and broader inquiry, and possibly a reason for denial of
      continuation of previously held privileges. Also, if a contract provider's status changes
      from personal services to non-personal services, licensure and medical malpractice
      insurance requirement must be met. Review the Kx C&P toolkit for guidance on
      deactivation, update and linking of CCQAS records.
      5.18.2.2. If the provider transfers to the ARC, the CCQAS record will be deactivated as
      above. The historical PCF is maintained at the MTF until requested by the ARC and then
      forwarded via the most cost effective accountable mail source. The gaining ARC unit will
      reenter the provider into CCQAS, link with the previous CRED record and update the
      record with the provider’s new role before the new E-application is initiated.
      5.18.2.3. All ANG medical units will forward the inactive historical PCFs to NGB/SG
      with a memorandum stating the reason why the historical PCF is being forwarded and
      deactivate the electronic PCF (i.e., separation, retirement, death, etc.). The NGB/SG will
      maintain historical PCFs as described in paragraph 5.18.1. Historical PCFs will be
      forwarded by the most cost effective accountable mail source to: NGB/SG, Attention:
      Credential Manager, 3500 Fetchet Avenue, Andrews AFB MD 20762-5157.
   5.18.3. All AD facilities will maintain a PAF (see Attachment 7) containing cumulative data
   information on a provider. This data will be used by the supervisor when filling out an
   evaluation of the provider for the 2 year review, etc. Files are kept for 2 year after the
   provider PCSs, separates, retires, or terminates employment and are then destroyed.
      5.18.3.1. Facilities will maintain PAFs for IMA/ Participating Individual Ready Reserve
      (PIRR) providers attached to their MTF.
5.19. Closing Medical Units.
   5.19.1. Inactive historical PCFs will be sent by the most cost effective accountable mail
   source to AFMOA/SGHQ. AFRC unit PCFs will be forwarded to AFRC/SG. ANG units will
   forward PCFs as outlined in paragraph 5.18.2.3. PAFs and other items not ordinarily
   contained within the PCF are not forwarded along with the PCF. However, the contents of
 76                                                                AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   the PAF will be summarized on an AF Form 22 which becomes part of the electronic PCF
   and is filed in the historical PCF forwarded to AFMOA/SGHQ; AFRC/SG; or NGB/SG as
   applicable. The provider’s electronic PCF will be deactivated.
      5.19.1.1. AFMOA/SGHQ will maintain PCFs as described in paragraph 5.19.1. and will
      be responsible for replying to requests from prospective employers for provider practice
      summaries.
   5.19.2. Medical units will attempt to notify providers of the location of their historical PCFs.
   5.19.3. PCFs of active IMA and PIRR providers who have not been reassigned will be sent
   to HQ ARPC/SG.

Section 5G—Non-Privileged Medical Professionals

5.20. PSV for Non-privileged Medical Professionals.
   5.20.1. Non-privileged medical professionals required by the organization, by law, or
   regulation to practice their profession must obtain and maintain an active, current, valid,
   unrestricted license, registration or certification. The organization verifies by primary source
   at the time of hire and upon expiration/renewal of the credentials.
      5.20.1.1. AFRS will accomplish PSV for all medical accessions requiring licensure,
      registration or certification IAW paragraph 5.5.
      5.20.1.2. Each MTF shall determine the office responsible for PSV of licensure,
      registration or certification of non-privileged medical professionals. This applies when
      hiring civil service, personal service contractor, non-personal service contractor, and
      volunteer employees and upon expiration and/or renewal of the licensure, registration, or
      certification. Note: For professionals hired through a non-personal service contract, the
      contractor is responsible to perform the PSVs and forward the documentation to the
      identified MTF office. This information must be primary source verified as indicated in
      paragraph 5.5.
      5.20.1.3. Non-privileged medical professionals must provide information on all licenses,
      registrations, or certifications active, inactive, or lapsed. An explanation for any licenses,
      registrations, certification that are not current, have been involuntarily relinquished, or
      have been subjected to disciplinary action, voluntary or involuntary suspension,
      reduction, restriction, or revocation must also be provided.
      5.20.1.4. For accessions and other employee applicants, any information concerning
      unfavorable actions against any licenses, registrations, certifications will be forwarded
      through the appropriate clinical chain of command to AFMOA/SGHQ, for coordination
      with the Chief Consultant, Nursing Services, for consideration and employment
      recommendation.
5.21. NPDB/HIPDB queries for RNs/LVNs/LPNs.
   5.21.1. AFRS will accomplish a one-time NPDB/HIPDB query for all nurse
   (RNs/LVN/LPNs) accessions except for Nurse Transition Program accessions who have no
   prior nurse experience. For new contract, GS, and volunteer nursing applicants, each
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                       77


   MTF/CC will determine the office responsible for querying the NPDB/HIPDB for nursing
   services.
       5.21.1.1. All positive reports will be forwarded through the appropriate clinical chain of
       command to AFMOA/SGHQ, to the attention of the Chief Consultant, Nursing Services,
       for consideration and employment recommendation.
       5.21.1.2. HQ AFRC/RS will accomplish a onetime NPDB/HIPDB query for all nurse
       (RN/LVN/ LPN) accessions. All positive reports (i.e., those with derogatory information)
       will be forwarded to HQ AFRC/SGO and the Reserve Nurse Career Field Manager for
       consideration and employment recommendation.

Section 5H—Screening Other Personnel Within the MTF

5.22. Shadowing of Medical Personnel in a Military Treatment Facility. Shadowing is a
time-honored recruitment tool, not only for medical professions, but for the Air Force in general.
In recognition of that, and with the increased emphasis on patient privacy and requirements of
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, all MTFs will comply
with the following guidance before allowing civilians to shadow AF medical professionals.
   5.22.1. The MDG/CC is ultimately responsible for the shadow program in their MTF.
   Shadowing is intended for short durations at the MDG/CC’s discretion. The MDG/CC may
   delegate this responsibility to the appropriate MTF Functional Manager(s).
   5.22.2. The MDG/CC or designated representative is/are responsible for the following:
       5.22.2.1. Determine the appropriateness of allowing individuals to shadow medical
       professionals based on age, school affiliations, staff availability and the needs of the
       AFMS within their area of responsibility in coordination with the appropriate squadron
       commander. Note: The shadowing program is not designed to circumvent the
       establishment of a Training Affiliation Agreement (TAA). If the individual will be
       getting credit toward required curricula then a TAA may be required (see AFI 41-108,
       Training Affiliation Agreement Program). The MTF volunteer program (AFI 41-115,
       Authorized Health Care and Health Care Benefits in the Military Health System (MHS),
       10 USC 1588 and DODI 1100.21) may also offer an alternative for interested parties who
       do not meet the recruitment intent of the shadow program or the need for a TAA.
       5.22.2.2. Establish a central in-processing point for all shadowing personnel.
       5.22.2.3. Ensure that a preceptor is identified by name for every shadowing person.
       5.22.2.4. Ensure HIPAA training is completed prior to shadow experience.
       5.22.2.5. Ensure Hospital Employee Health Program requirements are met as applicable
       prior to the shadow experience.
       5.22.2.6. Coordinate with Medical Legal Office as appropriate.
   5.22.3. The designated preceptor will ensure that shadowing personnel:
       5.22.3.1. Do not engage in any type of patient care.
       5.22.3.2. Sign a non-disclosure statement (see Kx C&P toolkit).
       5.22.3.3. Meet Hospital Employee Health Program requirements, as applicable.
78                                                             AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


     5.22.3.4. The designated preceptor will obtain verbal patient consent for observation and
     document consent for observation in the medical record.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        79


                                           Chapter 6

                               THE PRIVILEGING PROCESS

Section 6A—Considerations in Awarding Privileges

6.1. Background. Privileges define the limits of patient care services the provider may render.
They are based upon education, training, experience, health status, demonstrated current clinical
competence, professional behavior, and certifying examinations. The degree of supervised
clinical practice will be considered when awarding privileges.
   6.1.1. Newly accessed military providers who do not have adequate documentation of
   current clinical competence (i.e., sole practice providers with minimal clinical performance
   data), and providers whose duties have not included clinical practice for an extended period,
   should be recommended for supervised privileges. Note: As a condition of employment,
   contract and government civilian providers must meet all applicable credentialing
   requirements outlined in this AFI and be fully qualified to perform within the scope of their
   practice.
   6.1.2. The capabilities of the support staff, equipment, and other resources that may restrict a
   provider’s services will be considered when verifying the delineation of privileges at the
   MTF.
   6.1.3. See Section 6D for discussion of types of privileges.
6.2. General Information.
   6.2.1. Privileges must be appropriate to the training, background, and demonstrated current
   clinical competence of the provider. All providers being considered for a specific privilege
   must be evaluated against appropriate training and qualification standards. All AFRC
   providers must be engaged in direct patient care that meets or exceeds the minimum
   requirements for privileging in their specialty or be officially and temporarily exempted by
   their licensing authority (e.g., for academic or administrative purposes).
   6.2.2. Privileges are both individual and MTF/ARC medical unit specific. Military members
   requesting privileges should hold an AFSC (duty, primary, secondary, etc.) associated with
   that specialty. ARC providers will train to their duty AFSC. ARC providers assigned to unit’s
   during unit training assembly (UTA) will request UTA privileges in addition to duty AFSC
   privileges; however, only UTA privileges are supported during the UTA.
   6.2.3. Providers referenced in paragraph 6.6.1. must be eligible for the award of clinical
   privileges as a condition of employment or continued service with the AF, except for those
   functioning in strictly administrative or non-patient care research positions as their official
   DoD duties.
   6.2.4. Providers who interpret medical data on individual patients must be privileged and
   privileging should require documentation of some regular or periodic clinical practice,
   adequate enough to maintain currency.
   6.2.5. Privileging is not a disciplinary mechanism and will not be used as punishment for
   activities unrelated to clinical practice. It is a program for continually monitoring and
 80                                                                AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   assessing the performance of providers using the results of process improvement, peer
   review, and risk management activities. However, the MTF/CC (for ARC: RMU/CC or
   MDG/CC) must review acts of provider misconduct to determine if the misconduct has an
   impact on patient/staff safety and the provider’s scope of practice.
6.3. Relationship Among Privileges, Medical Staff Appointment, and Authorization to
Admit Patients. Before a provider can admit patients, the MTF/CC must award the provider
appropriate privileges and appoint him or her a member of the medical staff. Under no
circumstances will a provider, not yet given a medical staff appointment, admit patients to an AF
facility. Requirements that specifically authorize providers to admit are privileges appropriate to
inpatient care and medical staff appointment. For additional information, reference Section 6D
and Section 6E.
6.4. Electronic Privileging Process. The privileging module within CCQAS is used to
privilege providers within DoD. In unique scenarios the provider may need to complete a hard
copy (paper) application for privileges and medical staff appointment; however, this should be
the exception (e.g., contractors or individuals who are not issued a Common Access Card [CAC],
or dual status providers who, due to current limitations of CCQAS, are unable to complete
separate E-applications). The hard copy application for providers new to the AFMS may be
utilized to collect data to determine employment eligibility, create the CCQAS credentialing
record, and privilege the provider if unable to complete an E-application. Once providers obtain
their CAC an E-application should be completed. See the Kx C&P toolkit for additional
information on the current rules of engagement for completing the E-application to document the
privileging decision made off-line. The expectation is that the modules within CCQAS are fully
utilized to provide oversight of the credentialing and privileging processes within the MTF. The
MTF/RMU/MDG CM grants providers access to CCQAS to complete the E-application and
reviews and routes the application. See Section 6B and the Kx C&P toolkit for mandated
requirements for the electronic PCF and the electronic privileging process.
6.5. Master Clinical Privileges List. Each AD MTF will maintain master copies (―Strawman‖)
within the CCQAS privileging module and the AF standardized clinical privilege lists. For each
delineated item the verified column reflects (radio button ―Not Supported‖ or code ―3‖) those
privileges that the MTF cannot support due to professional policies or lack of adequate
equipment or personnel. The master strawman for ARC UICs at non-collocated AFRC bases will
reflect ―Not Supported‖ for Duty AFSC privileges (see paragraph 6.2.2.). The master privileges
lists are specific to the MTF and are utilized in verifying and awarding privileges. Any changes
to the master strawman within CCQAS will be reviewed and approved by the credentials
function. Additions and changes to supported capabilities should be approved by the credentials
function before the E-application is routed to the Level 1 reviewer. The master lists (within
CCQAS and off-line) will be reviewed by the credentials function and updated at least annually.
This review will be documented on the printed privileges list and noted in the credentials
function report. Note: It is necessary to maintain the AF standardized clinical privileges lists in
addition to the master privileges lists within CCQAS to accommodate unique scenarios where a
provider does not have a CAC and is unable to complete an online application.
6.6. Providers Affected by the Privileging Process. Each provider with independent authority
to begin, alter, or end a plan of treatment for a patient shall be privileged. Providers must be
privileged before they begin providing patient care services in the AF MTFs and/or ARC
medical units. Only military (AD/ ARC) and civilian (civil service, overseas local hire, contract,
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                          81


volunteer, Department of Veterans Affairs) providers in the following professions may be
awarded privileges:
   6.6.1. Audiologists, chiropractors (only at DoD-designated sites), clinical dietitians, clinical
   pharmacists, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, dentists, certified registered nurse
   anesthetists, certified nurse midwives, nurse practitioners, occupational therapists,
   optometrists, physical therapists, physician assistants, physicians, podiatrists, and speech
   pathologists. Note: Clinical nurses assigned to clinical nurse positions that hold nurse
   practitioner credentials cannot be privileged within the AFMS. The restriction is not
   applicable to the ARC.
   6.6.2. The HQ USAF/SG defines the scope of practice for each category of provider to be
   awarded clinical privileges. Chapter 7 outlines the professional scopes of practice for allied
   health professionals. In addition, the AF Officer Classification Directory outlines
   requirements for professional qualifications for the various specialties.
   6.6.3. The ASD(HA) establishes which professional groups may be awarded privileges. To
   seek approval to add another group, submit written request to AFMOA/SGHQ who will
   review, appropriately staff, and forward to the ASD(HA), if deemed appropriate.
   6.6.4. Privileges are not awarded to interns, residents, or advanced practice nurse students in
   training programs.
   6.6.5. Fellows and physicians attending a second residency (have completed a previous
   residency) and fully qualified in a specialty may be privileged and appointed to the medical
   staff to perform patient care to maintain competency as long as it does not interfere with
   current training.
   6.6.6. Dentists who are licensed in a US jurisdiction but undergoing postgraduate training
   may be granted core privileges. Dentists enrolled in postgraduate training remain subject to
   supervised practice within the requirements of the residency program.
   6.6.7. Privileges are not awarded to social workers in Airman Family Readiness Centers,
   social workers hired as sexual assault prevention and response coordinators, or social
   workers in family advocacy outreach manager positions providing outreach and prevention
   services in family advocacy programs (FAPs).

Section 6B—The Electronic Privileging Process

6.7. CCQAS Credentialing Record. Before the provider is granted access to complete a first
E-application, the CM will conduct a data quality review of the CCQAS credentialing record.
The record will be compared with the historical PCF and updated as required. The designated
minimum documents will be scanned, appropriately named, and uploaded to the provider’s
electronic PCF (CCQAS record) before routing the E-application (See Appendix A and B in the
Kx C&P toolkit). Once the document is uploaded to the electronic PCF, the CM will open the
document to ensure it is appropriately scanned with good image quality, is uploaded to the
correct provider record and is named correctly to include the file type and short file description.
Once the provider completes an E-application, all documents generated outside of the CCQAS
E-application that would have previously been maintained in the 6-part PCF will be scanned,
appropriately named and uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF. The previously established
6-part folder will become a historical repository, appropriately safeguarded and transferred when
 82                                                                  AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


providers are reassigned to another MTF but will no longer be the official record for compliance
with credentialing and privileging requirements. The electronic PCF (CCQAS record) will be the
official PCF. See paragraph 5.14 for requirements to establish and maintain a working file for
providers that have not previously had an established 6-part PCF. Paper documents will be filed
in the historic 6-part PCF or the working file but will not be subject to inspection. The snapshot
of the provider’s approved E-application will be printed (two-sided) and filed in Section 1 of the
historic 6-part PCF or the working file (if provider did not previously have a 6-part PCF) to serve
as a backup if unable to access CCQAS (this serves as a contingency plan if the network is
unavailable).
6.8. Completion of E-application. The CM will grant provider access/initiate application to
CCQAS to complete the E-application. Quick guides are available to assist the provider in
completing the E-application (see Kx C&P toolkit). The provider will E-sign the application and
attest to the validity of the data entered; therefore, it is prudent that the provider review each
section within the application and update as required. The CM will review the submitted
application for completeness and identify potential issues or items requiring additional
information from the provider. The CM review includes if the provider is requesting privileges
and the type of privileges requested. The CM will return the E-application to the provider if
additional information is needed. Once the application has been appropriately primary source
verified and queries performed (see paragraphs 5.2.3. and 5.2.4.), the CM will set up the
electronic routing of the application for review, recommendation and approval. At a minimum,
the application will be routed to the clinical supervisor (Level 1 Reviewer) for the privileges
requested, the Chief of the Medical Staff (Level 5 Committee Chair), and the privileging
authority. If the provider is requesting privileges in more than one specialty the application will
be routed to multiple Level 1 reviewers to obtain a recommendation for award of requested
privileges. See paragraph 6.33 for routing the MTF/CC’s applications and paragraph 6.18 for
non-collocated ARC units CC’s/senior physician’s applications.

Section 6C—The Credentials Function

6.9. Overview of the Process. Routine review and recommendations for award of privileges
and medical staff appointment for applications that do not have any issues can be done
electronically without convening the credentials function. The application will be routed as a
minimum to the clinical supervisor, chief of the medical staff and then the privileging authority.
These individuals are acting on behalf of the medical staff. Any applications with issues
(potential issues) must be addressed off line and the credentials function must be convened. In
addition, at any time during the electronic routing of an application if issues arise, the application
will be taken off line, the issues addressed, and then the application can be completed on line.
The credentials function will be required to meet as least quarterly to provide oversight of the
credentialing and privileging process and validate any applications approved since the function
last met. In addition, the credentials function will be convened to address any applications with
issues. An ad hoc credentials function will be convened IAW chapter 9 to address potential
adverse privileging/practice actions. ECOMS (for non-collocated AFRC: RMU/SGH) provides
oversight of the credentials function.
6.10. Credentials Function Membership. Each MTF with five or more privileged providers
must have a credentials function. If the MTF has fewer than five privileged providers, provider
E-applications will be routed to another facility as directed by AFMOA/SGHQ. The consulting
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                      83


MTF credentials function reviews the E-application and makes privileging recommendations to
the referring MTF/CC. ARC medical units are not required to establish a credentials function.
   6.10.1. Credentials function composition should reflect the diversity of providers practicing
   within the facility, but, at a minimum, there should be representatives from each corps with
   privileged staff members. All privileged providers within the MTF are eligible to serve as
   members of the credentials function. The MTF/CC may have members of the affiliate
   medical staff serve to meet this requirement.
   6.10.2. When the credentials function is validating the award of clinical privileges to an
   allied health provider, the SGH will select at least one member from the same discipline to
   serve as a voting member (if one is locally available). This voting member can be included in
   the routing of the E-application; however, would not be assigned as the Level 1 reviewer,
   which is reserved for the clinical supervisor. There may be a need to confer with someone of
   the same discipline from AFMOA or the referral MTF to ensure privileging
   recommendations are appropriate. Note: This policy is not required for awarding temporary
   or supervised privileges.
   6.10.3. The chief nurse serves as an advisor to the credentials function as a non-voting
   member.
6.11. Credentials Function Procedures.
   6.11.1. The medical staff, through the credentials function, reviews provider requests for
   privileges and medical staff appointment, provider credentials and performance data, and
   recommends privileges and staff appointment to the MTF/CC. The MTF/CC is the
   privileging authority who then awards or denies clinical privileges. (Reference paragraph
   9.27.3.6. denial of clinical privileges.) The credentials function will formally meet at least
   quarterly to maintain appropriate oversight of the entire process (see Kx C&P toolkit for an
   example of a standard agenda). The credentials function must also be convened to review any
   E-application or paper application for privileges and medical staff appointment that warrants
   further review and discussion before a recommendation can be made to the privileging
   authority.
   6.11.2. The process of individually reviewing and making a recommendation on the
   privileges application without convening a credentials function is known as ―fast tracking‖
   and should only be used for ―clean‖ applications. If there are concerns about an individual’s
   request for privileges and, most definitely, for potential adverse actions, the credentials
   function must have the opportunity to engage in a live discussion.
       6.11.2.1. The E-application: Routine applications will be routed electronically within
       CCQAS so the appropriate individuals can review the application and make their
       recommendations to the privileging authority. The application will be routed at a
       minimum to the clinical supervisor (Level 1 Reviewer), chief of the medical staff (Level
       5 Committee Chair) and then the privileging authority. These individuals are acting on
       behalf of the medical staff. The E-application, once completed by the provider, reviewed
       by the credentials manager, and required credentials PSVd, is routed via the CCQAS
       privileging module to the appropriate individuals who thoroughly review and evaluate the
       E-application and make a recommendation to the privileging authority.
 84                                                                AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


       6.11.2.2. Off-line application: If the provider had not completed the E-application, the
       clinical supervisor and chief of the medical staff would need to review the PCF, PAF, and
       the provider’s application for privileges (AF Form 1540/1540A). They vote ―yes‖ on the
       record by signing the AF Form 1540/1540A which is then forwarded to the MTF/CC. If
       the vote is ―no,‖ the credentials function must formally meet to discuss the application.
       6.11.2.3. Validation of Decisions Made on Applications. The credentials function will
       review and validate all applications (to include all fast tracked applications) acted upon
       by the privileging authority since the last scheduled credentials function. The majority of
       the credentials function members eligible to vote should be present or able to be involved
       in the process. In the event that the credentials function recommends modifying the fast
       track privileges that were awarded, this is recorded as an administrative action rather than
       an adverse privileging action.
       6.11.2.4. When evaluating a member of the credentials function, the chairperson must
       excuse the individual from that portion of the meeting or activity. Annotate his or her
       absence in the credentials function summary report.
       6.11.2.5. Whenever it is necessary for the credentials function to meet to review an
       application before a privileging recommendation can be made (e.g., presence of potential
       issues), the majority of the credentials function members eligible to vote should be
       present or able to be involved in the process.
   6.11.3. Credentials function proceedings are documented in the summary report that is
   provided to the ECOMS.

Section 6D—The Privileging Process within the MTF or ARC medical units

6.12. Providers Seeking Privileges.
   6.12.1. Complete and/or review the E-application, for currency and accuracy, answer the
   practice history and health status questions and E-sign the application. Chapter 5 outlines the
   credentials that are used in the credentialing and privileging process to include the
   application forms if the provider was not able to complete an E-application. See quick guide
   for completion of application in Kx C&P toolkit.
   6.12.2. Within the E-application the provider selects and completes the appropriate clinical
   privileges list(s) for his or her specialty(ies). General Medical Officers (GMOs) complete the
   Family Practice privileges list (if required to complete an off-line application use the AF
   Form 2816, Clinical Privileges-Family Practice and Primary Care Physicians). GMOs trained
   in aerospace medicine complete the Preventive Medicine Sub-specialists (Aerospace
   Medicine, Occupational Medicine, and Preventive Medicine) privileges list (if required to
   complete an off-line application: AF Form 4305, Clinical Privileges-Preventive Medicine
   Sub-specialists Aerospace Medicine, Occupational Medicine, and Preventive Medicine).
   ARC providers will complete the Unit Training Assembly privileges list for their corps (if
   required to complete an off-line application use the AF Form 4318, Clinical Privileges-Air
   Reserve Component (ARC)-UTA) and their primary AFSC clinical privileges list. (Note:
   The primary AFSC clinical privileges list will contain all code ―Not Supported‖ or ―3s‖ as
   these functions are not supported on UTA weekends and cannot be verified by the ARC
   medical units). The ARC provider’s completion of the duty AFSC privileges provides
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                      85


  information on what the provider feels they are competent to perform and facilitates award of
  privileges during periods of active duty.
     6.12.2.1. Instructions for completing privileges list: Requested privileges are based on
     education, training, current competency and ability to perform and will not consider any
     known facility limitations. Privileges requested must be substantiated by supporting
     documentation. The provider must indicate a designation for each delineated privilege.
     Note: Contract providers only request privileges within the specialty for the contracted
     service they provide within the MTF. Reserve providers must hold appropriate AFSCs
     for privileges requested.
         6.12.2.1.1. E-application: The applicant selects the appropriate designation: ―Fully
         Competent‖; ―With Supervision‖; or ―Not Requested‖ for each privilege. The
         provider reviews and completes the clinical privileges contained within the E-
         application.
         6.12.2.1.2. Off-line application: The applicant enters the appropriate code number in
         the block marked ―Requested‖ for each privilege. Code ―1‖ for ―Fully Competent‖;
         code ―2‖ for ―With Supervision‖ and code ―4‖ for ―Not Requested‖. Each block must
         have a code number. The applicant signs and dates the form and returns it to the CM.
     6.12.2.2. For those providers who are required to complete the off-line privileges lists
     that include more than one type of profession (i.e., psychiatry includes clinical
     psychologists and clinical social workers), inapplicable sections may be crossed through.
     Because many part-time civilian providers are utilized for very specific skills rather than
     their full scope of care, they may request only those privileges they intend to use at the
     MTF.
     6.12.2.3. Providers who feel they are no longer competent to perform a specific
     procedure should request ―With Supervision‖ (code ―2‖) or ―Not Requested‖ (code ―4‖)
     on the appropriate section of the privileges list. This is not considered an adverse
     statement or action. Once they gain needed training and/or experience and again feel
     competent to provide that care, they may apply for and be granted unsupervised
     privileges in that area. The provider’s clinical supervisor is responsible for determining
     the degree of supervision required for ―With Supervision‖ (code ―2‖) privileges (refer to
     Glossary for definition of supervision).
  6.12.3. Comply with MTF/RMU/MDG by-laws, rules and regulations.
  6.12.4. Maintain appropriate documentation of CHE and promptly provide pertinent CHE
  updates, via copies of specific CHE coursework, to the credentials manager for data input.
  Once updated in CCQAS, the supporting documentation may be returned to the provider
  unless specifically related to the privileges awarded (i.e., conscious sedation). At a minimum,
  providers will produce these documents upon initial application for privileges and at biennial
  renewal. Providers may enter this information when they complete their E-application. Refer
  to paragraph 5.4.5.7. for further information.
     6.12.4.1. If the requested privileges are based on the attainment of continuing education,
     the CM will enter the training on the post graduate training tab within CCQAS. The CM
     will scan, name IAW standard naming conventions (see Kx C&P toolkit) and upload the
     training certificate to the provider’s electronic PCF.
 86                                                                AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   6.12.5. Review performance data as provided in their PAFs, Composite Health Care System
   (CHCS), Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) (described
   in glossary) and/or other applicable databases.
   6.12.6. Provide updates on credentials maintained in the electronic PCF to the CM or ARC
   credentials liaison for non-collocated medical units as changes occur.
   6.12.7. Complete orientation.
   6.12.8. Acknowledge award of privileges.
       6.12.8.1. E-application: Acknowledge award of privileges via the E-application once
       privileges and/or medical staff appointment is granted. Providers may download or print
       a copy of their approved E-application to include approved clinical privileges list.
       6.12.8.2. Off-line application: Complete off-line acknowledgement letter for award of
       privileges/medical staff appointment once the privileging authority grants privileges
       and/or medical staff appointment. The providers will be given a copy of their approved
       clinical privileges list.
6.13. Clinical Supervisors.
   6.13.1. Meet with the applicant (if possible) to discuss clinical capabilities, expectations, and
   unique MTF requirements before the provider completes their clinical privileges list(s). This
   discussion may occur telephonically or via email as the provider may have the opportunity to
   complete the E-application prior to arrival at the MTF if he/she is currently assigned to
   another DoD facility.
   6.13.2. Review the application package.
       6.13.2.1. Clinical Supervisors who lack the expertise to adequately evaluate a provider's
       privileges will ask AFMOA/SGHQ for assistance. AFMOA/SGHQ will coordinate with
       specialty consultants to identify reviewers. The MTF/RMU/MDG is permitted to consult
       directly with an appropriate DoD/VA facility which has the specific specialty required to
       provide an adequate evaluation. Both of these options should be coordinated with the
       MTF/RMU/MDG SGH. Refer to chapter on peer review for consultation.
       6.13.2.2. For senior staff providers, such as the flight commander or chief of the medical
       staff, applying for privileges and/or medical staff appointment, a qualified privileged
       provider in a like specialty acts as the clinical supervisor. This individual serves as the
       clinical supervisor as they possess the clinical expertise to provide appropriate clinical
       oversight of the provider’s practice regardless of the provider’s position or military rank.
   6.13.3. Verify requested privileges after review of the provider’s completed application.
       6.13.3.1. E-application: Ensure appropriate delineation of verified requested privileges.
       Note that the provider’s requested privileges automatically default into the Level 1
       column. (See paragraph 6.13.3.3. for further discussion.) The privileges not supported at
       the MTF are displayed within the E-application. Once the requested privileges are
       reviewed, select the appropriate recommendation and E-sign the application.
       6.13.3.2. Off-line application: Complete the clinical supervisor’s recommendation on
       submitted privilege lists. Review the requested privileges (in conjunction with the
       facility’s master privilege lists to ensure ―Not Supported‖ (code ―3‖) is entered as
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                      87


     required, enter either ―Fully Competent‖ (code ―1‖),‖With Supervision‖ (code ―2‖), or
     ―Not Requested‖ (code ―4‖) as appropriate (reference 6.12.2.1.2.) in the block marked
     ―Verified‖ for each line item, select the appropriate recommendation block, and sign the
     application.
     6.13.3.3. Any differences between the provider’s requested privileges and those that are
     verified by the clinical supervisor shall be reviewed with the provider. One example is
     when the provider requests ―Fully Competent‖ (code ―1‖) but the clinical supervisor
     verifies ―With Supervision‖ (code ―2‖) for some specific privileges. Every attempt should
     be made by the clinical supervisor to educate the provider on the MTF bylaws, rules and
     regulations in an effort to appropriately complete the application for privileges. The
     clinical supervisor will return the E-application without action to allow the provider to
     address the differences. Any remaining differences must be addressed with a comment
     for the delineated item within the E-application or for the off-line application, on the
     applicable AF Form 1540/1540A as a modification of the requested privileges.
     6.13.3.4. Verifying specific privileges as ‖Fully Competent‖ (code ―1‖) or ―With
     Supervision‖ (code ―2‖) is not the same as overall regular or supervised privileges. Refer
     to Section 6E for a full description of the type of privileges that may be granted.
     6.13.3.5. For providers who do not yet have their authorizing document to practice (i.e.,
     license, certification, registration), privileges requested ―Fully Competent‖ or ―With
     Supervision‖ (code ―1‖ or ―2‖) must be verified by the clinical supervisor as ‖With
     Supervision‖ (code ―2‖). The clinical supervisor will be required to enter a comment for
     each delineated item. The comment could be copied and then pasted into each required
     field. In this situation, the provider will be granted supervised privileges with a plan of
     supervision until regular privileges are awarded.
     6.13.3.6. It is possible to have a mixture of various codes and still be granted regular
     privileges. Regular privileges may be granted if the provider does not meet the criteria for
     supervised privileges and is qualified to practice some privileges independently (Refer to
     Attachment 1 for definition of supervised privileges).
     6.13.3.7. The plan of supervision as described in paragraph 6.28.2.1. is not required for
     those providers granted regular privileges but with some specific ―With Supervision‖
     (code ―2‖) privileges. It is possible that the provider does not plan to or need to progress
     to ―Fully Competent‖ (code ―1).‖ The degree and type of supervision for those items
     annotated ―With Supervision‖ (code ―2‖) is at the clinical supervisor’s discretion.
     Privileges may be upgraded to ―Fully Competent‖ (code ―1‖) following credentials
     function review of documented evidence of additional training/education through a
     formal program or via locally planned and executed upgrade training. An E-application
     (Modification E-application or E-application if the provider does not have an approved E-
     application to date) for modification of privileges would be completed.
  6.13.4. The clinical supervisor will check the appropriate block on the AF Form 1540/1540A
  (whichever is applicable), signs and dates the form if an off-line application was completed
  (see paragraph 6.4.).
  6.13.5. After the clinical supervisor reviews the completed application it is routed per the
  established MTF routing schema. It may be routed to the chief of service or the next
 88                                                              AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   privileged provider in the clinical chain of command. At a minimum, it must be routed to the
   chief of the medical staff before routing to the privileging authority for action.
6.14. Chiefs of Service/Department Chairperson.
   6.14.1. E-application. Will review the provider’s E-application, select appropriate
   recommendation, and E-sign the application. ―Return the application without action‖ to
   address any discrepancies off-line. Once the issue is appropriately addressed, continue the E-
   application process.
   6.14.2. Off-line application: The chief of service or the next privileged provider in the
   clinical chain of command reviews the application package, checks the appropriate block on
   the AF Form 1540/1540A, signs and dates the form.
      6.14.2.1. Any discrepancies between the provider’s requested privileges and those that
      are recommended for approval must be addressed on the applicable AF Form
      1540/1540A.
      6.14.2.2. Returns the application package to the CM for routing to the Credentials
      Function chairperson.
6.15. Credentials Function Chairperson (SGH or the ARC Designated Physician).
   6.15.1. Ensure all incoming providers complete orientation to include information on
   applicable DoD, AF, and local instructions, policies, and procedures governing patient care
   and medical staff responsibilities. Providers will also be oriented to continuity of care
   responsibilities, ethics policies, and continuing education requirements and opportunities.
      6.15.1.1. For civilian providers hired directly by the MTF, the SGH is responsible for
      interviewing and orienting new civilian hires. The SGH may delegate this function to
      another active member of the medical staff. Contract groups may also be delegated this
      authority for contract personnel.
      6.15.1.2. The documentation that orientation was completed should be filed in the
      provider’s PAF as this documentation is not needed to make a credentialing and
      privileging recommendation; therefore, it would not be filed in the provider’s electronic
      PCF. Prior to the establishment of the electronic PCF, this documentation was filed in
      Section I of the PCF. It is not necessary to place this documentation in the PAF for
      provider who had previously completed the orientation at the current MTF.
   6.15.2. Will review the provider’s application.
      6.15.2.1. E-application: Select appropriate recommendation and E-sign the application.
      ―Return the application without action‖ to address any discrepancies off-line. Once the
      issue is appropriately addressed, continue the E-application process.
      6.15.2.2. Off-line application: Review the application package, check the appropriate
      block on the AF Form 1540/1540A, sign, and date the form. Any discrepancies between
      the provider’s requested privileges and those that are recommended for approval must be
      addressed on the applicable AF Form 1540/1540A. Ensure the package is forwarded to
      the MTF/CC for approval.
6.16. The MTF/CC or ARC Privileging Authority.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                         89


   6.16.1. Consider the recommendations of the credentials function chairperson (or ARC
   designated physician) and take action to award individual provider privileges.
       6.16.1.1. E-application: ―Return the application without action‖ to address any
       discrepancies off-line is an option available to the privileging authority. Once the issue is
       appropriately addressed, continue the E-application process. Any discrepancies between
       the provider’s requested privileges and those that are recommended for approval must be
       addressed by entering a comment for the delineated privilege item within the E-
       application. If this would result in a potential adverse privileging action, do not approve
       the E-application until the issue is taken off-line and the provider is afforded due process.
       Note: For initial applications, the privileging authority may limit privileges when there is
       no evidence of actual or suspected substandard performance (e.g., the provider has not
       practiced for an extended period of time). This does not constitute a denial of privileges
       and, therefore, is not an adverse privileging action (reference Chapter 9 for further
       information).
       6.16.1.2. Off-line application: Any discrepancies between the provider’s requested
       privileges and those that are recommended for approval must be addressed by entering a
       comment in the Remarks section of the AF Form 1540/1540A. Sign and date the form.
       Note: For initial applications, the privileging authority may limit privileges when there is
       no evidence of actual or suspected substandard performance (e.g., the provider has not
       practiced for an extended period of time). This does not constitute a denial of privileges
       and, therefore, is not an adverse privileging action (reference Chapter 9 for further
       information).
   6.16.2. Provider acknowledgement of privileges awarded.
       6.16.2.1. E-application: Once the privileging authority has E-signed the application, the
       CM will electronically route the application to the provider for acknowledgement of the
       privileges granted. The provider then has 14 calendar days to acknowledge receipt and
       accept or appeal the decision of the privileging authority. For the ARC, the provider has
       60 calendar days to acknowledge receipt and accept or appeal the decision of the
       MTF/CC (for non-collocated ARC: RMU/CC or MDG/CC). This serves as the official
       notification of privileges/medical staff appointment. The provider should review
       privileges granted and may download and/or print a copy of their complete application or
       the approved privileges from the E-application.
       6.16.2.2. Off-line application: Will advise the provider, in writing, of the privileges
       granted. The provider then has 14 calendar days to acknowledge receipt and accept or
       appeal the decision of the privileging authority. For the ARC, the provider has 60
       calendar days to acknowledge receipt and accept or appeal the decision of the MTF/CC
       (for non-collocated ARC: RMU/CC or MDG/CC). The provider should be given a copy
       of their off-line approved privileges.
6.17. Modification of Privileges Revisions and Corrections to Privilege Lists. To change a
designation or code number on the currently approved privilege list or to add privileges not
previously requested, the applicant will consult with the CM as this will be handled via
completion of an E-application. If the provider has an approved E-application on file, they will
request a Modification E-application (see Quick Guide on Kx C&P toolkit) and appropriately
annotate the clinical privileges within the E-application to reflect the modification. Providers
 90                                                                 AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


who do not have an approved E-application on file will complete an E-application to reflect the
modification to their current off-line privileges. The supporting documentation for the
modification of the privileges is forwarded to the CM to be scanned, named IAW the standard
naming conventions (see Kx C&P toolkit) and uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF. The E-
application is then appropriately PSVd (must re-PSV authorizing document to practice
[license/certification/registration] and conduct NPDB/HIPDB queries, routed IAW MTF
established routing for E-applications and then approved by the privileging authority.
6.18. ARC Privileging Process. The privileging authority for reserve collocated medical units
and ARC personnel providing healthcare during the AF training cycle and special assignments
that take place within an AD MTF is the host AD MTF/CC. The privileging authority for non-
collocated medical units is as follows:
   6.18.1. ANG Privileging Authority (MDG/CC) for non-collocated medical units.
       6.18.1.1. The MDG/CC will review the E-application and recommendations by
       designated senior physician and award privileges to assigned providers. If the MDG/CC
       is not a physician; the senior physician in the unit will review the E-application and make
       privileging recommendations to the MDG/CC, who grants privileges to the requesting
       providers. In this case, the privileging authority for the senior physician is extended to the
       State Air Surgeon (SAS).
       6.18.1.2. Each SAS will review the MDG/CCs E-application (within their state) and
       award them privileges. In the absence of an SAS, this authority is extended to the
       NGB/SG.
       6.18.1.3. The NGB/SG will review the E-application and award privileges to SASs and
       is the final privileging authority for the ANG.
   6.18.2. AFRC Privileging Authority (RMU/CC) for non-collocated medical units.
       6.18.2.1. The RMU/CC will review the E-application and recommendations by the SGP
       or SGH and award privileges to assigned providers. If the RMU/CC is not a physician,
       the senior physician in the unit will review the E-application and make privileging
       recommendations to the MDS/CC. In this case, the privileging authority for the senior
       physician is extended to the Regional Support Group (RSG)/SG.
       6.18.2.2. The RSG/SG will review the E-application and award privileges to the
       RMU/CCs within his or her region. If the RSG/SG is not a physician, the senior
       physician in the RSG/SG will review the E-application and make privileging
       recommendations to the RSG/SG. If no RSG physician is available, the reviewer will be
       AFRC/SG.
       6.18.2.3. The AFRC/SG will review the E-application and award privileges to the
       RSG/SG, or senior physician, if applicable, and is the final privileging authority for the
       AFRC.
6.19. ARC Privileging Issues.
   6.19.1. ARC providers will complete the E-application selecting UTA privileges and the
   duty AFSC privileges within the E-application. The AF Form 4318, Clinical Privileges-Air
   Reserve Components (UTA), and duty AFSC privileges list as applicable are available as a
   data collection tool for new accession and as a backup to the E-application. Off-line
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                         91


   applications should not be completed for providers already privileged within the AFMS;
   instead providers should complete E-applications.
   6.19.2. Awarding of the UTA and duty AFSC privileges are based, in part, upon the
   provider’s civilian work experience and duty specific training.
       6.19.2.1. In support of medical readiness, the military duties of ARC personnel should
       focus on their duty AFSC. For example, even though an individual is a general surgeon in
       civilian practice, if his or her military duty AFSC is a flight surgeon, the military
       activities should be as a flight surgeon.
   6.19.3. Providers who are assigned to and who provide patient care services in medical units
   must have a CCQAS record with appropriate verified credentials and be awarded clinical
   privileges before beginning practice.
   6.19.4. Providers will not be privileged or provide any patient care services without
   attending UTAs and maintaining training requirements.
   6.19.5. Providers will not be privileged or provide any medical services while attending
   training unless specifically assigned to a support tasking such as support for an operational
   readiness inspection (ORI), etc.
   6.19.6. Although the ARC medical provider must request duty AFSC privileges when
   completing an application for privileges, the duty AFSC privileges are not supported during
   UTA. Likewise, UTA privileges awarded to ARC medical providers for UTAs will not apply
   when assigned clinical duties in an AEF training cycle, annual tour or on special assignments
   at an AD MTF. The providers should be awarded appropriate AFSC-specific privileges
   supported at the assigned location during this period.
   6.19.7. When an ARC medical unit is collocated with an active duty MTF, the host AD
   MTF/CC awards privileges for ARC providers. These include UTA privileges and activities
   that take place within the AD MTF directly associated with the ARC readiness requirements
   and unit training. A Transfer (ICTB) E-application would be required for the ARC provider
   to perform duty AFSC privileges within the MTF during annual training or on a special
   assignment.
   6.19.8. If Participating Individual Ready Reserve (PIRR) providers do not participate often
   enough for the privileging authority to grant privileges, their files shall be maintained at the
   attached MTF in an inactive status. The file can be reactivated when the provider returns and
   completes an application for clinical privileges which initiates the credentialing and
   privileging process.
6.20. Management of ANG Providers Practicing at Combat Readiness Training Center
(CRTC). This section outlines the specific management of ANG providers providing clinical
care at designated CRTC locations. NGB/SG and AFMOA/CC will designate the AD MTF
responsible to privilege ANG physicians providing clinical medicine at the designated CRTC
locations. Prior to rendering care at the CRTC location, the prospective ANG flight
surgeon/physician must be granted privileges for clinical care by the designated AD MTF. All
non-primary care trained flight surgeons (for example, radiologists, pathologists, etc.) desiring to
practice clinical medicine at the CRTC without sufficient current clinical competency in primary
care must be granted supervised privileges and a physician trained in a primary clinical practice
 92                                                                 AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


field will be identified who can provide clinical supervision and a review of patient care delivery.
The NGB/SG will be responsible for identifying the supervising physician.
   6.20.1. All ANG physicians seeking clinical privileges at the CRTC location must complete
   a Transfer (ICTB) E-application via CCQAS. Documentation supporting current clinical
   competency (to include recent primary care practice experiences when available) must be
   scanned, appropriately named and uploaded into the provider’s electronic PCF. This
   documentation would include current civilian privilege lists or a MFR stating the provider
   does not hold privileges in the civilian sector.
   6.20.2. The scope of practice at the CRTC locations will be defined and approved by the
   NGB/SGP and coordinated with the designated AD MTFs.
   6.20.3. A peer review process for the care delivered by each physician at the CRTC will be
   in effect. The NGB/SG will define criteria to be utilized in the review of the clinical work
   performed at the CRTC location. The NGB/SGP will appoint a clinical peer to review the
   clinical care delivery documentation. If two or more physicians are assigned to the CRTC
   location and are fully competent in the scope of practice provided, then the peer review can
   be accomplished at the CRTC. Documentation of the completed peer review will be provided
   to the NGB/SGP and the designated AD MTF.
   6.20.4. For a solo practicing CRTC physician or if the assigned physicians are not fully
   competent in the scope of practice provided at the CRTC location, records for peer review
   must be copied and forwarded to the NGB/SGP for review.
   6.20.5. The number of records for peer review for each assigned provider is outlined below.
       6.20.5.1. 30 or less patients seen during tour: 100% chart review.
       6.20.5.2. 31-100 patients seen during tour: 30 charts reviewed.
       6.20.5.3. 101-500 patients seen during tour: 50 charts reviewed.
   6.20.6. NGB/SGP will ensure chart review is accomplished in a timely manner and
   forwarded to the designated AD MTF for review/oversight.
   6.20.7. In the event the peer review results indicate a clinical adverse action should be taken,
   the NGB/SG will identify and appoint the investigating officer after consultation with the
   designated AD MTF/CC. The investigating officer will forward the results of the
   investigation to the AD MTF/CC for review and action.
   6.20.8. The NGB/SGP will maintain a template for the support agreements between the
   various CRTC locations and the designated AD MTFs.
6.21. Management of Contract Provider Privileges. Contract healthcare provider privileges
will be managed IAW established DoD and AFMS credentialing, privileging, and medical staff
appointment processes, outlined in this instruction and in DoD directives. Providers who are
assigned to, or who provide care in the MTF must have an electronic PCF and be awarded
clinical privileges before providing medical services. See paragraph 5.18.2.1. for management of
contract providers already privileged by the MTF when the contract ends and the provider is re-
hired under a new contract.
   6.21.1. Contracts impacting credentialed and/or privileged personnel will be coordinated
   with the Chief of the Medical Staff and the CM.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        93


   6.21.2. Contract healthcare providers should participate in medical staff activities.
   6.21.3. Formally assigned and trained Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP), knowledgeable
   about the Performance Work Statement (PWS) for contractor-provided services, will perform
   healthcare contract surveillance. Note: IAW AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics Support, Chapter
   4, work statements must be coordinated through the base contracting offices. HQ
   AFMOA/SGMLC is available at Fort Detrick, MD 21702-5006 (DSN 343-8077) to provide
   advice on preparing PWS, quality surveillance plans, and other documents required to
   procurable medical service contracts.
   6.21.4. According to MTF PI/RM policy, QAP will report issues or incidents involving non-
   personal services contract healthcare providers IAW local policy, to the appropriate MTF
   medical logistics office who, in turn, reports to the base contracting officer or to the
   appropriate TRICARE channels. The QAP will promptly notify the SGH of any quality of
   care issues identified.
6.22. Privileging in a Field Environment during Peacetime Training or in Support of an
Expeditionary/Contingency Mission. When a medical unit deploys for peacetime training or
expeditionary/contingency missions, the scope of practice for its assigned providers is defined as
follows:
   6.22.1. If providers will practice in a fixed MTF, the MTF will review credentials and award
   appropriate privileges. A Transfer (ICTB) E-application will be initiated by the sending
   MTF. To expedite privileging actions, deploying medical units should provide an ICTB at
   least 15 days in advance of the arrival date.
   6.22.2. If providers will not practice in a fixed MTF, the deployed medical commander is
   responsible for the scope of practice of the deployed unit. The sending MTF/RMU/MDG CM
   will initiate an ICTB letter within CCQAS; however, the Transfer (ICTB) E-application will
   not be generated. Providers will deploy with a copy of their ICTB letter and current clinical
   privileges list(s), and civilian privileges lists (or MFR stating they do not hold privileges in
   the civilian sector), as applicable. The senior physician at the deployed location will assist
   non-physician commanders in determining the appropriate scope of practice.
       6.22.2.1. The scope of practice of deployed units providing care in an area, which is
       normally the responsibility of a fixed MTF, must coordinate the level of care provided in
       the field environment with the fixed MTF/CC.
       6.22.2.2. In field locations where a fixed MTF does not have responsibility for care,
       providers should not exceed the privileges defined by their home MTF/ARC medical unit
       and the capabilities of the deployed unit itself.
       6.22.2.3. Deployed personnel will be familiar with the medical, dental, and ancillary
       capabilities of the referral MTF and host country healthcare facilities.
       6.22.2.4. Privileging actions are not appropriate in the field environment. Privileges are
       not granted and adverse privileging actions are not initiated outside of fixed MTFs. If
       necessary, the commander may limit or stop the practice of a provider in the field by
       issuing a verbal or written order to the provider. Should this occur, the commander is
       responsible to report this action to the provider’s home unit. (See paragraph 9.11. and
       Chapter 9 for additional information).
 94                                                                 AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   6.22.3. The C-NAF SG responsible for the deployed location is contacted for further
   guidance/clarification. Waivers for deployed locations will be submitted through the C-NAF
   SG to AFMOA/SGHQ. AFMOA/CC is the waiver authority for policy related to deployed
   units.
6.23. Care in Emergency or Wartime Situations. In emergency or wartime situations where
referral or alternative care is not available, privileged providers must, to the extent allowed by
their licenses, clinical ability, and absent competent refusal to consent, do everything necessary
to save the life of an individual or to avoid serious health impairment.
6.24. Granting Privileges to Short-Term Affiliates using the ICTB. This guidance applies to
manning assistance, consultants, ARC personnel, and other short-term affiliates. A short-term
affiliate applies for clinical privileges only if he or she will perform temporary duties by
providing direct patient care at a gaining AD MTF. (See Section 6E for the medical staff
appointment process). The sending MTF or ARC medical unit conveys pertinent credentials and
privileging information to the gaining MTF using the ICTB which is automated in CCQAS.
(Refer to Attachment 6 for required ICTB format to be used when CCQAS is unavailable. See
the User’s Guide for additional information on CCQAS).
   6.24.1. On-line Transfer (ICTB) Application: Providers requiring an ICTB who do not yet
   have an approved E-application on file must first complete and have an approved E-
   application on file. The CM then initiates the Transfer (ICTB) E-application NLT 60 days
   prior to the TDY. In addition to the Transfer (ICTB) E-application, ARC personnel will have
   the copy of current military and civilian privileges lists (if not privileged in the civilian
   facility, include MFR indicating such). This additional documentation will be scanned,
   appropriately named and uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF. The provider must
   complete the Transfer (ICTB) E-application NLT 30 days prior to the TDY start date which
   will be routed for review and approval at the gaining MTF. Before the provider can practice
   at the ICTB location the provider must have an approved Transfer (ICTB) E-application at
   the receiving MTF.
   6.24.2. Off-line ICTB: Will only be generated when the provider is going to a deployed,
   humanitarian or field location. The sending MTF or RMU/CM initiates the ICTB letter
   within CCQAS. The sending MTF/CC (or designee) or ARC privileging authority must sign
   the ICTB letter. The hard-copy ICTB package (signed ICTB letter, copies of the provider’s
   current approved clinical privileges list, and for ARC personnel civilian privileges lists [if not
   privileged in the civilian facility, include MFR]) is sent at least 60 days in advance by
   registered, certified, or other accountable mailing source to the gaining MTF. In addition,
   some host countries require actual copies of various credentials such as licenses and/or BLS
   or ACLS certification.
   6.24.3. At the gaining MTF:
       6.24.3.1. The Transfer (ICTB) E-application will be reviewed, primary source verified,
       and routed at the gaining MTF as with any other E-application.
       6.24.3.2. At the completion of the provider’s assignment, the clinical supervisor
       completes an AF Form 1562 or AF Form 22, which is then returned to the parent unit.
6.25. Generating ICTB for Telemedicine. The CM will initiate the Transfer (ICTB) E-
application for providers engaged in telemedicine. Refer to paragraph 6.38. to determine if, when
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                          95


initiated, the E-application should be suppressed. If the provider is providing consultative or
interpretative services the E-application is suppressed; however, the receiving facility will review
the sending MTF’s approved application that is available within CCQAS to ensure the provider
has the appropriate credentials to perform the requested services. If the provider is beginning,
altering or terminating care, the provider will need to complete the E-application for the
receiving facility and the application would be routed and approved at the receiving MTF
regardless of the provider’s physical location.
6.26. Generating ICTBs for DoD Providers Working in Veterans Affairs Facilities. The
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the DoD have established a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) to facilitate the credentialing of healthcare providers between the VA and
the DoD. This MOU establishes the guidelines for sharing the credentialing data collected and
verified by one Department with the other which will expedite the appointment process of those
providers who are shared across Departments. The off-line ICTB will be generated from CCQAS
for DoD providers seeking privileges within VA facilities. The off-line ICTB, hard copy of
approved privileges, and copies of the PSVs of non-time limited credentials will be provided to
the VA for DoD providers working in VA facilities under the credentials sharing MOU. VA
facilities will provide a VetPro Coordinator’s Summary in lieu of the off-line ICTB for VA
providers seeking privileges in AFMS facilities. More detailed guidance and the current MOU
can be found in the Kx C&P toolkit.
6.27. Civilian Consultants. Follow procedures outlined below for civilian consultants who are
short-term affiliates. The documents listed below collectively serve as the ICTB:
   6.27.1. A current curriculum vitae, a copy of their current civilian privileges list, an original
   letter from their current institution verifying that their credentials are being actively
   monitored, and proof of medical malpractice coverage/limits of liability. The letter must be
   on the official letterhead of the organization, signed by the chief of medical staff, and dated
   within one year. The letter must list the provider’s credentials, to include NPDB/HIPDB
   query results and health status, and must verify his or her professional degree(s),
   postgraduate training, board certification, and current professional license(s). Note: Civilian
   consultants must comply with the host state licensure laws.
   6.27.2. The AFCCVO, on behalf of the MTF, PSVs the provider’s license/authorizing
   document to practice, obtains a NPDB/HIPDB query and, if applicable, FSMB query and
   DHHS/TRICARE sanctioned provider listing review (reference paragraph 5.4.6.3.).
   6.27.3. The MTF/CC will sign a document containing the following statement and attach it
   to the provider’s ―ICTB‖ as outlined in paragraph 6.27.1.: ―(Provider’s name) is granted
   regular privileges commensurate with those awarded by the (name of the provider’s MTF or
   civilian employer) credentials function while doing duty at (name of visiting MTF) from
   (date) to (date). Privileges are awarded to the extent supportable by the facility’s capabilities.
   (Name of provider) is appointed as an initial-affiliate medical staff member during this time
   period.‖

Section 6E—Types of Privileges

6.28. Procedures and Requirements for Specific Types of Privileges.
96                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


  6.28.1. Regular Privileges. Regular privileges are granted to providers only after full
  verification and review of credentials. Regular privileges allow the provider to independently
  provide medical care within defined limits. These privileges are based upon the individual’s
  education, professional license, professional certifications, experience, competence, ability,
  health, and judgment.
     6.28.1.1. Selecting ―With Supervision‖ (code ―2‖) does not place a provider in the same
     category as a provider granted supervised privileges. Regular privileges may be granted if
     the provider is not in a category that requires a period of supervised privileges and is
     qualified to practice some privileges independently.
     6.28.1.2. Clinical pharmacists, physician assistants and physical therapists (with
     prescriptive authority) are required to have a clinical preceptor appointed in writing and
     may be granted regular privileges according to their scope of practice. Note: Physical
     therapists without privileges for writing prescriptions will not require a physician
     preceptor but a clinical supervisor as with any other privileged provider. (Reference
     Chapter 7 for additional information).
     6.28.1.3. APNs no longer require a physician preceptor be identified in writing but must
     have a physician supervisor available for consultation and collaboration. (Reference
     Chapter 7 for additional information).
  6.28.2. Supervised Privileges. Supervised privileges will be granted to providers who lack
  the necessary licensure or certification for independent practice if all minimal educational
  requirements are met. Providers who fail to maintain licensure will not be placed under
  supervised privileges (reference paragraph 4.4.2.). The credentials function should also
  recommend supervised privileges for recent accessions without adequate documentation of
  current clinical competence, for providers who have not clinically practiced for a period of 2
  years or more, for those providers in an orientation period required to assess competency, or
  at the commander’s discretion, pending completion of the CHBC. The clinical supervisor
  will recommend upgrades to regular privileges when appropriate. Supervised privileges may
  be granted for up to two years and may be renewed by the privileging authority in
  extenuating circumstances.
     6.28.2.1. Supervised privileges are awarded in the same manner as regular privileges
     except that a clinical supervisor with regular privileges in the same scope of practice must
     be named, in writing, at the time privileges are awarded. A written supervision plan (see
     Kx C&P for suggested template) and schedule for periodic progress reports must be
     prepared by the clinical supervisor and acknowledged by all involved personnel. This
     document will be scanned, appropriately named IAW standard naming conventions (See
     Kx C&P toolkit), and uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF. Written periodic
     progress reports must be provided to the CM to be presented at the Credentials Function.
     6.28.2.2. The clinical supervisor determines the required degree of supervision, based on
     the background, experience, and demonstrated skill of the supervised provider. Degrees
     of supervision are described in the glossary under ―Supervision.‖
     6.28.2.3. The clinical supervisor will select ―With Supervision‖ (code ―2‖) for all
     delineated privileges and enter a comment indicating all are performed under supervision.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        97


     6.28.2.4. Supervision for a ―sole practice specialist‖ may be provided in several different
     ways (refer to Chapter 8, Competency Assessment and Peer Review). The provider who
     has the most similar training and experience may clinically supervise the specialist. If the
     clinical supervisor is not qualified to review a specific procedure, the records will be sent
     for review to the regional consultant or other qualified reviewer in that discipline. The
     regional consultant (or other qualified specialist) may be invited to make periodic visits
     to the MTF to review cases or assist with procedures. The supervised provider may be
     sent TDY to a facility that provides the specialty service, or manning assistance in that
     specialty may be requested.
  6.28.3. Temporary Privileges (This is not applicable to the ARC). Temporary privileges are
  awarded on an emergency basis to meet a pressing patient care need when full credentials
  review cannot be performed. They are time limited to 30 days and will NOT to be used to
  extend the renewal period.
     6.28.3.1. Credentials requirements include the following:
         6.28.3.1.1. A copy of the provider’s license must be obtained and primary source
         verified.
         6.28.3.1.2. Verification (documented in the electronic PCF) by the facility where the
         provider holds regular privileges indicating that the individual is a competent, fully
         qualified medical staff member in good standing and that the proposed privileges are
         within the individual’s current scope of practice and privileges.
     6.28.3.2. The credentials function chairperson then recommends granting of temporary
     privileges to the privileging authority. If he/she is not available, the credentials function
     chairperson may grant the privileges. The privileging authority will sign a document
     containing the following statement: ―(Provider’s name) is granted temporary privileges
     commensurate with privileges awarded by the (name of the provider’s MTF or civilian
     employer) credentials function while doing duty at (name of visiting MTF) from (date) to
     (date). Privileges are awarded to the extent supportable by the facility’s capabilities.
     (Name of provider) is appointed as an initial-affiliate medical staff member during this
     time period.‖ This document will be scanned and uploaded to the provider’s electronic
     PCF.
  6.28.4. Disaster Privileges. Disaster privileges may be granted when the emergency
  management plan has been activated and the organization is unable to handle the immediate
  patient needs. This is not accomplished on-line in CCQAS. (For additional information for
  scope of practice see paragraph 6.23.). The privileging authority or the SGH or designee(s)
  has the option to grant disaster privileges, but is not required to do so. The decision to grant
  disaster privileges is on a case-by-case basis at his/her discretion, upon presentation of any of
  the following:
     6.28.4.1. A current picture hospital ID card; or a current license to practice and a valid
     picture ID issued by a state, Federal, or regulatory agency; or Identification indicating
     that the individual is a member of a Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT); or
     Identification indicating that the individual has been granted authority to render patient
     care in emergency circumstances, such authority having been granted by a federal, state,
 98                                                                 AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


       or municipal entity; or Presentation by current hospital or medical staff member(s) with
       personal knowledge regarding practitioner’s identity.
       6.28.4.2. The MTF begins the verification process of the individuals who have received
       disaster privileges as soon as the immediate situation is under control. This verification
       process is identical to the process established for granting temporary privileges (refer to
       paragraph 6.28.3.1.2.).

Section 6F—Medical Staff Appointment (This not applicable to the ANG)

6.29. General. Appointment status reflects the relationship of the provider to the medical staff.
At the time a provider is granted privileges or has privileges renewed, he or she may also be
granted a medical staff appointment, which runs concurrently with the privileges. Privileges must
be granted before a medical staff appointment is made. A provider may not admit patients
without a medical staff appointment. Medical staff appointment may be revoked without
revoking privileges and privileges may be granted without granting a medical staff appointment.
6.30. Types of Medical Staff Appointment. The type of appointment will vary depending on
the privileges to be exercised, the availability of the medical staff member to the facility, and the
reason he or she is practicing at the MTF. Medical staff appointments as defined by DoD are as
follows:
   6.30.1. Initial Medical Staff Appointment. Initial medical staff appointment is granted to a
   provider during his or her first 12 months of privileged practice within the AFMS, or after a
   period of greater than 180 days without an active or affiliate medical staff appointment in a
   DoD MTF. Initial appointments require full credentials function review.
       6.30.1.1. During this period, the medical staff member’s performance will be under close
       review by his/her clinical supervisor for clinical competence as well as for compliance
       with the facility’s policies, procedures, bylaws, and code of professional conduct. During
       this period, the member may also have supervised privileges based on lack of experience,
       lack of necessary licensure, etc., as described in paragraph 6.28.2.
       6.30.1.2. An initial medical staff appointment leads to an active or affiliate medical staff
       appointment and should be designated as such when granted (i.e., initial-active, or initial-
       affiliate). When designated in this way, the appointment indicates the provider’s
       responsibilities associated with the target appointment.
       6.30.1.3. Before the initial medical staff appointment ends, the provider will complete an
       E-application. The CM will grant providers, who had initially completed an off-line
       application, access/initiate application so the provider can complete an E-application.
       CCQAS will automatically generate a renewal application for those providers who had
       initially completed an E-application. The provider will need to update the ―type of
       appointment requested‖ on the position tab to ―active‖ or ―affiliate‖, as applicable. The
       clinical supervisor and the credentials function must review the provider's performance,
       both clinically and professionally as a member of the medical staff, to determine if an
       active or affiliate staff appointment should be awarded and make recommendations to the
       MTF/CC. Note: Professional activities include conduct (behavioral patterns) which may
       or may not directly affect the provider’s ability to perform clinical duties.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                       99


       6.30.1.4. Failure to advance from an initial to active or affiliate appointment shall cause
       the expiration of but not termination of the medical staff membership.
   6.30.2. Active Medical Staff Appointment. Active medical staff appointment assigns
   responsibility to the provider for all functions and duties within the medical staff. Full
   credentials review is required for an active staff appointment. This appointment is granted to
   individuals exercising regular privileges who have completed an initial medical staff
   appointment at a DoD MTF. They are full-time staff members expected to participate fully in
   medical staff duties.
   6.30.3. Affiliate Medical Staff Appointment. Affiliate medical staff appointment is for
   medical staff members whose medical staff responsibilities and duties are reduced or
   eliminated because of limited duty or employment within the MTF. Full credentials review is
   required for an affiliate staff appointment. Affiliate staff appointments may be given to
   individuals exercising regular privileges who have completed an initial medical staff
   appointment at a DoD MTF, who are consultants, or to individuals who work in the MTF on
   a part-time basis.
   6.30.4. Temporary Medical Staff Appointment. Temporary medical staff appointment is
   granted in emergency situations when necessary to fulfill pressing patient care needs and,
   when time constraints will not allow a full credentials review. Temporary medical staff
   appointment is required when providers practicing under temporary privileges will be
   admitting patients. This appointment runs concurrently with and for the same duration as the
   temporary privileges.

Section 6G—Reprivileging and Reappointment Requirements

6.31. General Information. The Credentials Function will continuously evaluate the quality of
each provider’s practice (Reference Chapter 8, Competency Assessment and Peer Review for
additional information). Biennial re-privileging is based upon provider performance data. The
AF Form 22 is used to summarize performance data used in the reprivileging decision. The form
will be scanned, appropriately named and uploaded to the electronic PCF before the renewal
application is routed to the clinical supervisor.
   6.31.1. The Credentials Function will formally review, and the privileging authority must
   reconsider, each provider’s privileges and medical staff appointment at least every 24
   months. Note: Providers awarded an initial medical staff appointment must have their
   privileges and medical staff appointment reviewed and renewed after the initial 12 months.
   6.31.2. If a provider’s privileges lapse prior to renewal, the provider will be removed from
   patient care until the complete reprivileging process is accomplished. There is not a
   mechanism to extend privileges past the expiration date. Unprivileged providers will not
   continue to provide patient care services (Reference paragraph 6.6.). A memorandum should
   be included in the PCF explaining the reason for the privilege lapse. (See Kx C&P toolkit).
   Note: If the provider has been practicing with lapsed privileges, 100% of the provider’s
   records from that period must be reviewed by another privileged provider and countersigned.
   This is a serious risk management issue for the provider, the clinical supervisor responsible
   for review of the records, the MTF, and the AFMS. Management reports contained within
   CCQAS should be used to preclude having providers practice with lapsed privileges.
 100                                                              AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   6.31.3. At a minimum, the clinical supervisor, SGH, and the MTF/CC or ARC privileging
   authority must review each provider’s E-application and recommend renewal of privileges
   and medical staff appointment.
   6.31.4. If any reviewer does not recommend renewal, the E-application will be returned
   without action and the issue addressed off-line. The reviewer must provide an explanation to
   the credentials function chairperson or to the privileging authority. Once the issue has been
   resolved, the E-application process can continue to appropriately document the privileging
   decision.
6.32. Reprivileging and Reappointment Process.
   6.32.1. The CM will, through the parameters set within the CCQAS privileging module for
   providers with an approved E-application on file or by separate correspondence, notify the
   providers of the need to complete their E-application for renewal of clinical privileges, at
   least 90 days in advance of the biennial review. Privileges must be evaluated prior to
   reaching 24 months. At the end of 24 months, privileges expire. Note: Providers initially
   awarded an Initial Medical Staff Appointment will expire after 12 months.
       6.32.1.1. Provider completes the E-application for privileges (reference paragraph 6.4).
       6.32.1.2. ARC providers must also provide current privileges from all civilian practice
       (reference paragraph 5.4.5.8.3.).
       6.32.1.3. The AF Form 22 is required when privileges are renewed. The data for the AF
       Form 22 should include peer review results (reference Chapter 8, Competency
       Assessment and Peer Review), outcome metrics, and other ongoing evidence-based
       competency assessments. The form may be tailored or overprinted to the provider’s
       particular practice patterns through use of the ―Remarks‖ section on the form. (Refer to
       AFMOA/SGHQ website at https://kx.afms.mil/clinicalquality for sample AF Form
       22s). The AF Form 22 is scanned, named IAW standard naming conventions and
       uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF (see Kx C&P toolkit.). This off-line clinical
       performance assessment will be used to summarize and capture data from focused
       professional practice evaluations and on-going professional practice evaluations (see
       chapter 8 for additional information). Note: Future enhancements within the CCQAS
       privileging module may facilitate the completion of an on-line Performance Assessment
       Report (PAR). In the interim, the CM will cancel the on-line PAR and the AF Form 22
       will be used instead. AFMOA/SGHQ will provide updated guidance when the on-line
       PAR replaces the use of the AF Form 22.
          6.32.1.3.1. The provider’s clinical supervisor will use the PAF (refer to paragraph
          6.33. below for additional information), if applicable, to complete an AF Form 22 to
          summarize all pertinent information on the performance and conduct of the provider
          during the period of evaluation.
          6.32.1.3.2. AF Form 22s should be completed by an assigned clinical supervisor for
          deployments, annual tours (for ARC personnel), manning assistance and routine
          TDYs. For ARC personnel: If no AF Form 22 was accomplished then provide an AF
          Form 1562 along with a copy of current civilian privilege list.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                       101


       6.32.1.4. Provider submits new CHE information to CM for updating prior to the
       initiation of the E-application or the provider may enter the information when completing
       the E-application (reference paragraph 5.4.5.7.).
       6.32.1.5. The renewal application is then completed like any other E-application. See
       section 6B for additional guidance.
6.33. Provider Activity File (PAF).
   6.33.1. The PAF contains only temporary QA documents, contents are described in
   Attachment 7. It includes documents such as data collected for performance-based
   privileging during the specified period of time. The Privacy Act of 1974 and 10 U.S.C.
   §1102, governs access to PAFs. The PAF cover must contain the following statement: ―THE
   PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 GOVERNS ACCESS TO THIS FILE‖ and ―QUALITY
   ASSURANCE DOCUMENT EXEMPT FROM DISCOVERY IAW TITLE 10 U.S.C.,
   SECTION 1102. DO NOT RELEASE.‖ The PAF is an extension of the electronic and
   historic PCF. It is maintained in a separate off-line folder and kept in a secure location. This
   file is not appropriate for safety briefings and other human resource documents. Providers
   can review their files, but they cannot remove them from the control of the local custodian.
   With the exception of IMAs, the ARC is not required to maintain a PAF on providers but
   must summarize performance data using AF Form 22 (refer to paragraph 6.32.1.3.).
   6.33.2. Disposition of information within the PAF. The PAF will not accompany the
   electronic PCF or the historical paper PCF when the AF reassigns the provider to another
   MTF. The PAF contents are summarized on the AF Form 22 which is scanned, named IAW
   standard naming conventions and uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF (See Kx C&P
   toolkit). However, all data in the PAF that leads to the restriction, reduction, revocation,
   denial, or voluntary surrender of privileges becomes part of the adverse action case file and is
   maintained in Section III of the historic PCF or if appropriate, the working file. The
   appropriate documents are scanned, appropriately named and uploaded to the provider’s
   electronic PCF. Contact AFMOA/SGHQ for additional information when dealing with
   appropriate disposition of adverse action documentation. For additional details on the
   disposition of the PAF, refer to paragraphs 5.18. and 5.19. Contact AFMOA/SGHQ for
   requests to transfer PAFs to a gaining MTF.

Section 6H—Miscellaneous Privileging Issues

6.34. Management of Impaired Providers. Any medical condition that does (or potentially
could) adversely affect an individual’s ability to safely execute his or her responsibilities in
providing healthcare can be considered an impairment. This includes alcohol or drug
impairment, medical conditions, or mental health disorder. The credentials function will review
individuals who are impaired and determine if their health status hampers their practice. For
further information refer to Chapter 9, Section 9E.
6.35. Awarding/Renewing Clinical Privileges to MTF/CC. The CM will contact
AFMOA/SGHQ CCQAS database administrator to establish the appropriate routing of the E-
application. The local credentials function will review the E-application and make
recommendations. The MTF SGH will be assigned as the Level 5 Committee Chairperson
reviewer. The Inpatient or the Outpatient SGH Consultant at AMFOA will be assigned as the
 102                                                              AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


Level 6 Committee Chairperson reviewer. The AFMOA/CC will be assigned as the Privileging
Authority.
6.36. Providers Assigned to Geographically Separated Units (GSUs). Providers assigned to
GSUs must have an electronic PCF and be awarded clinical privileges and medical staff
appointment by the host unit which is the privileging authority. Note: GSUs are physically
separated from the host unit but are supported by and are under the command and control of the
host unit commander. ARC non-collocated units are not considered GSUs and the individual unit
commander has operational command and control of it’s activities.
6.37. Conscious Sedation for Dentists. Conscious sedation is discussed in AFI 44-102. As
with all procedures, award of specific privileges to perform conscious sedation is based upon
appropriate education, training, and experience. Because this skill is not part of basic dental
education, paragraph 6.22. of AFI 47-101, Managing AF Dental Services, addresses specific
training guidelines that must be met for dentists to be permitted to do conscious sedation. This
training is annotated under the Post Graduate Training tab within the provider’s electronic PCF
and the supporting documentation is scanned, named IAW the standard naming conventions, and
uploaded to the provider’ electronic PCF.
6.38. Telemedicine and Consultative Services.
   6.38.1. A provider who engages in consultation services from a remote site does not have to
   be credentialed and privileged at the referring MTF. However, if this provider directs patient
   care, (i.e., orders a treatment or course of action), then he or she must be privileged by the
   MTF where the care is provided.
   6.38.2. Providers Engaged in Telemedicine Services. The CM at the sending MTF will
   initiate a Transfer (ICTB) E-application within CCQAS. If the provider is only providing
   consultative services at the site where the patient is located the E-application within CCQAS
   is suppressed when the ICTB is initiated. This serves as notice to the receiving MTF that the
   provider is providing consultative services to their facility and provides an opportunity for
   the credentials function to review the snapshot of the provider’s approved application from
   the sending MTF. This serves as the mechanism by which the receiving facility approves
   services provided. If the provider is directing treatment, the Transfer (ICTB) E-application
   would be completed by the provider and routed for approval at the receiving MTF. This
   ICTB E-application is then processed as outlined in paragraph 6.24.
6.39. Interpretive Services Not Covered by Telemedicine Standards.
   6.39.1. Interpretative services are services in which a licensed independent practitioner (LIP)
   provides official readings of images, tracings, or specimens (this may be accomplished
   through a telemedicine link). Examples of practitioners who often perform these services are
   radiologists and pathologists. Usually, these services are obtained under contract.
   6.39.2. For contracted patient care, treatment, and interpretive services, the originating site
   will use both the credentialing information and privileging decisions from the TJC or DoD
   AAAHC accredited distant site if the staff at the originating site knows that the LIP
   providing services holds the appropriate privileges at that distant site.
       6.39.2.1. If the interpretive services are provided by providers at another DoD MTF
       (distant site) an ICTB will be initiated and the CM will suppress the initiation of the
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                       103


       Transfer (ICTB) E-application. The originating MTF (via the CCQAS ICTB record) will
       then have access to review the providers approved privileges and ensure that all services
       provided by the contracted individuals are within the scope of his or her privileges.
       6.39.2.2. All contracts for interpretive services should specify in the contract that the
       contracting entity will ensure that all services provided by the contracted individuals will
       be within the scope of his or her privileges.
       6.39.2.3. If the contracted individuals are not privileged within a DoD MTF (but the
       facility is accredited by TJC or AAAHC), the originating site must obtain a copy of their
       current privileging lists to ensure they are appropriately privileged to perform the
       requested interpretative services.
   6.39.3. Providers providing these types of services that are not privileged within a DoD MTF
   or another TJC or DoD AAAHC-accredited organization must be fully credentialed and
   privileged by the MTF.

Section 6I—Applying for Other Documents Monitored by the Medical Staff Office

6.40. Applying for National Provider Identifier (NPI). Beginning 23 May 05, Public Law
104-191, NPI final rule (45 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 162) mandated the adoption of
standard unique identifiers for healthcare providers and health plans. For DoD purposes, all
healthcare providers who furnish billable healthcare services or those who may initiate and/or
receive referrals must obtain an NPI Type 1. This includes but is not limited to privileged
providers, residents, and IDMTs. NPIs will be assigned at no fee by the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS).
   6.40.1. Providers will apply for and receive only one NPI, which will be a permanent
   identifier and does not need to be renewed. The provider, however, must update any changes
   to his/her demographic information as needed, such as address changes. The initial
   application and updates can be made via the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System
   (NPPES) web site at https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov.
   6.40.2. At the time of application for privileges, the CMs will query the provider to see if
   they have obtained an NPI and, if not; provide guidance on the NPI application process.
   Once the NPI is obtained, the CM will file a copy in the electronic PCF and forward a copy
   to the MTF NPI POC for Defense Medical Human Resource System Internet (DMHRSi). If
   DMHRSi is not yet deployed at the MTF, the MTF CM will forward a copy of the NPI to the
   AFCCVO for input into DMHRSi.
       6.40.2.1. IDMTs will apply for an NPI and forward a hardcopy of their NPI to the IDMT
       Program Coordinator and the MTF POC for entering NPIs into DMHRSi.
       6.40.2.2. For ANG providers, the CM submits a copy of the NPI to ANG/SG, Attention:
       Credential Manager, 3500 Fetchet Avenue, Andrews AFB MD 20762-5157.
   6.40.3. DMHRSi is the database of record for the NPI. Once the NPI number is entered into
   DMHRSi, it is pushed to CCQAS and other applications within the MHS. The NPI cannot be
   released from the 10 U.S.C. §1102 protected CCQAS database or the PCF. Any questions on
   the appropriate release should be forwarded to AFMOA/SGHQ.
 104                                                             AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


6.41. DoD Fee-Exempt DEA Certification. Licensed physicians, residents, dentists,
podiatrists, optometrists and clinical psychologists with prescriptive authority should obtain a
DoD fee-exempt DEA certificate. Licensed physician assistants and licensed advanced practice
nurses are eligible for a fee-exempt DEA. This fee-exempt DEA will only be used for official
duties in the care of DoD beneficiaries and may not be used for any other category of patients.
The number will be used for prescribing and administering only and will not be used for
purchasing or storing of controlled substances. In addition to the DEA application, the provider
will complete and sign the statement of understanding. The MTF CM will verify licensure, sign
the application certifying the provider meets the requirements for a fee-exempt DEA certificate
and forward the application and statement of understanding to the DEA. The original DEA
certificate and a copy of the statement of understanding will be scanned, named IAW standard
naming conventions, and uploaded to the provider’s electronic PCF (see Kx C&P toolkit). A
copy of the DEA certificate will be provided to the provider. The DEA will be reissued when the
provider PCSs (with new practice location address) and will be voluntarily surrendered upon
separation/termination of military service/employment. For specific information on this process
refer to the Kx C&P toolkit.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                              105

Note 1: For each professional group, some general background and educational requirements are
listed. (Educational requirements reflect current accession criteria. Some personnel already
working in the AFMS may not be required to meet the stated criteria; i.e., NPs who were
awarded the 46Y3A (46N3A) or 46Y3B (46N3B) AFSC prior to 1997 as graduates of a
certificate, non-graduate level education program, remain qualified for the AFSC as long as the
national certification remains current). Refer to AFI 36-2005, Appointment in Commissioned
Grade and Designation and Assignment in Professional Categories--Reserve of the Air Force
and United States Air Force, and ANGI 36-2005, Appointment of Officers in the Air National
Guard of the United States and Reserves of the Air Force, for a complete listing of accession
criteria and the Air Force Officer Classification Directory for AFSC qualifications. Scope of
practice and supervision requirements are defined. (See specific privileges lists for further details
regarding scope of practice.) Normally, enlisted medical and dental personnel operate within the
guidelines established by the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) which defines
the enlisted scope of practice. Civilian Medical and Nursing Assistants must function within the
scope of practice as defined by the state where the MTF is physically located. Newly hired
contract personnel are fully qualified within their specialty and must present evidence of current
competency.
Note 2: Privileged-Advanced Practice Nurses (P-APNs): Non-privileged Nurse Practitioners,
Certified Nurse Midwives, and Certified Nurse Anesthetists must first be officially awarded the
appropriate specialty 46YX AFSC, and be assigned to an authorized APN billet to be privileged
and function in a privileged provider role. This restriction is not applicable to the ARC. P-APNs
who move into non-direct patient care positions may function as providers to maintain currency.
The Chief of Medical Staff and Chief of Nursing Services, IAW MTF policies and procedures,
shall establish guidance on the use of these providers. For awarding of the 46YX to Non-AF
sponsored APNs, see AFI 46-101, Nursing Services and Operations (applies to Active Duty
only).
7.2. Acute Care Nurse Practitioners.
   7.2.1. Background. Acute Care Nurse Practitioners (ACNP) are registered nurses who have
   obtained advanced education, training and certification to practice independently, providing
   care to acute, critical and complex chronically ill/injured adults, in the inpatient critical or
   intensive care settings. The ACNP practices within a healthcare system that provides
   consultation, collaborative patient care management, or referral as indicated by the health
   status of the client.
   7.2.2. Education/Licensure/Certification Requirements:
       7.2.2.1. Graduation from a master’s degree program with specialization as an acute care
       nurse practitioner accredited by a national nursing accrediting agency recognized by the
       US Department of Education. By 2015 entry level to practice will be at the doctoral level.
       7.2.2.2. Licensure as addressed in Chapter 4.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        107


       7.2.2.3. National certification in specialty (i.e., certification through the American
       Nurses Credentialing Center [ANCC]).
   7.2.3. Scope of Practice:
       7.2.3.1. ACNPs practice independently and collaboratively in the inpatient critical or
       intensive care setting caring for acute, critical or complex chronically ill or injured adult
       patients. Actively participate in multidisciplinary care meetings and patient rounds, and
       serve as a liaison between nursing and physician staff.
   7.2.3. 2 May participate as a member of a specific specialty or consult service to include a
   specialty-based clinic; however, 80% of practice must be direct patient care in the inpatient
   critical or intensive care setting.
       7.2.3.3. Diagnose and provide ongoing management of medical, surgical and trauma
       patients; order and interpret diagnostic studies; monitor and provide appropriate nutrition
       therapy; teach, counsel and advise patients, families, and staff about current medical
       conditions. Initiate admission, transfer and discharge orders; and perform pre-operative
       and post-operative management.
       7.2.3.4. Perform invasive and non-invasive procedures as defined and approved on the
       provider privileges list; provide on-going ventilation management; initiate and evaluate
       treatment regimens which may include prescribing, monitoring and altering medications
       appropriate for privileged scope of care.
       7.2.3.5. May act independently in areas of demonstrated competency within the
       designated scope of practice, as indicated by ―Fully Competent‖ or code ―1‖ on their
       privileges list.
       7.2.3.6. May pull call and work as sole provider with physician consultation available as
       described in paragraph 7.2.4.1. if these specific privileges have been granted as ―Fully
       Competent‖ or code ―1‖ on the privileges list.
   7.2.4. Supervision:
       7.2.4.1. ACNPs granted MTF privileges must have physician (privileged for the same
       scope of practice) consultation available either in person, by phone, or electronic means
       when they are performing direct patient care activities.
       7.2.4.2. As with any privileged provider, ongoing professional practice evaluation

     outlined in Chapter 8) is required. Periodic review of performance is required at least
     biennially as part of the competency-based privileging process. Examples of competency
     assessment include periodic review of a representative sample of medical records, direct
     observation of performance, and verbal/written assessment of clinical knowledge/skills.
     7.9.4.2. Unlicensed clinical psychologists (N/A to the ARC) who have completed their
     doctorate:
         7.9.4.2.1. May be granted supervised privileges and an initial medical staff
         appointment.
         7.9.4.2.2. Are supervised by a fully qualified licensed provider who will establish a
         plan of supervision based on the unlicensed psychologist’s skills and needs. At a
         minimum, the supervisor will meet with the unlicensed psychologist for at least one
         hour every week to meet state licensure requirements.
         7.9.4.2.3. Supervision can be obtained from one of the following (listed in order of
         preference):
            7.9.4.2.3.1. A privileged mental health provider at the MTF, including a reservist,
            if assigned, or

         7.9.4.2.4. Note: As described in Chapter 6, the clinical supervisor must be a
         provider who has regular privileges in the scope of practice for which he or she is
         supervising. EXCEPTION: A VA provider or civilian psychologist shall have full
         credentials review as a consultant, as described in paragraph 6.27.
  7.9.5. Miscellaneous:

          must be done by a psychologist.
       7.9.5.2. If at all possible, other clinical psychologists will supervise entry level
       psychologists. Most states require this type of supervision.
       7.9.5.3. When a psychologist who is granted ―supervised privileges‖ needs to make a
       recommendation regarding a patient in a special duty program assignment, the
       recommendation should be reviewed by a mental health provider at the local MTF. If this
       is not possible, the review may be accomplished by a privileged mental health provider at
       a different MTF. The supervised psychologist must document his or her discussion with
       the supervisor in the mental health record. This annotation, and any other documented
       recommendations about the special duty program patient, will be cosigned by a
       privileged physician at the local MTF.
7.10. Clinical Social Workers.
   7.10.1. Background. AF social workers facilitate individual, family, and corporate health.
   Clinical social workers are key members of the mental health team, most frequently working
   in mental health clinics, family advocacy programs, and substance abuse treatment services.
   They also provide clinical case management services to enrolled beneficiaries.
   7.10.2. Education/Licensure/Certification Requirements:
       7.10.2.1. Master of Social Work (MSW) degree from an accredited school of social
       work.
       7.10.2.2. Experience in clinical social work, either through a master’s-level practicum or
       two years post-MSW experience.
       7.10.2.3. License/certification from a US jurisdiction. Effective 1 Oct 98, state
       licensure/certification at any MSW level became the qualifying document, while national
       certification became optional. Social workers on AD or employed by the AF, unless
       specifically exempted as an entry-level clinical social worker, must be licensed/certified
       by a US jurisdiction at a level that allows practice of clinical social work without
       supervision. Exception to policy includes those individuals who have yet to complete the
       two years of post-MSW supervised experience (N/A to the ARC) required by state
       licensure that allows independent practice without supervision (i.e., ROTC cadets in
       MSW programs and personnel who have completed MSWs through AF-sponsored or off-
       duty education). Social Workers accessed without an independent clinical practice level
       license (N/A to the ARC) must obtain such license within three years of accession.
       7.10.2.4. Entry level clinical social workers (N/A to the ARC) are individuals who have
       been awarded a state license/certification available to master’s-level social workers with
       less than two years of post-MSW experience. These individuals must be awarded
       supervised privileges.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                     119


         7.10.2.4.1. Note: Clinical social workers with more than two years of post-MSW
         experience will also be considered entry level if they hold a license which would not
         authorize them to practice without supervision in their state of licensure.
     7.10.2.5. Fully qualified clinical social workers are individuals who have completed an
     MSW, a minimum of two years post-MSW social work experience, and possess a state
     license/certification that allows practice without supervision. These individuals may be
     awarded regular privileges.
         7.10.2.5.1. Those AF social workers, who are practicing clinical social work with a
         license that would require supervision for the practice of clinical social work (N/A to
         the ARC), are to be placed on supervised privileges as an administrative (not adverse)
         action until they obtain the necessary level of license.
         7.10.2.5.2. The issue of licensure for clinical social workers is complicated by the
         fact that US jurisdictions have such varied approaches to licensure for social workers.
         Some states do not license social workers until they have a minimum of two years of
         post-MSW experience. Some have multiple levels of licensure which differentiate
         among associates degree, bachelors degree, and MSW-level social workers. States
         with multiple levels of licensure frequently also differentiate between clinical and
         non-clinical (or generalist) social workers. In some states, clinical social workers
         must be designated as "licensed clinical social workers" or "licensed independent
         clinical social worker" in order to be allowed to practice clinical social work without
         supervision. Social workers are instructed that the license they require for a "fully
         qualified" status is a "license that allows the practice of clinical social work without
         supervision." The license must allow the full scope of clinical practice, including the
         diagnosis of mental disorders. If questions about the license remains, the chief of the
         medical staff should review the social worker's licensure status with the consultant for
         clinical social work.
  7.10.3. Scope of Practice:
     7.10.3.1. Conduct clinical interviews and evaluate patients.
     7.10.3.2. Diagnose mental disorders and formulate diagnosis and treatment plans.
     7.10.3.3. Recommend administrative and medical dispositions.
     7.10.3.4. Provide individual, couple, family, and group psychotherapy; hypnosis (refer to
     AFI 44-102); formal sex therapy (refer to AFI 44-102); and biofeedback, when
     appropriately trained to do so. The chief of the medical staff should review the provider’s
     credentials with the consultant for clinical social work if he or she is unfamiliar with the
     credentials requirements.
     7.10.3.5. Admit, treat, and discharge patients, with physician oversight, to/from inpatient
     substance abuse treatment programs.
     7.10.3.6. Perform risk assessments and determine degree of danger posed by the patient.
     7.10.3.7. Screen records and personnel for security clearances and make administrative
     recommendations.

       training required by AFMOA/SGHW).
       7.10.3.12. May act independently in areas of demonstrated competency within their
       designated scope of practice, as indicated by ―Fully Competent‖ or code ―1‖ on their
       privileges list.
   7.10.4. Supervision:
       7.10.4.1. Generally, other clinical social workers will supervise entry-level social
       workers, if at all possible. In order to meet licensure requirements, some states require
       supervision by licensed clinical social workers with a specific number of years of
       experience. The requirement of the specific state in which a license that allows practice
       of clinical social work without supervision shall be considered during the development of
       a social worker’s plan of supervision. Fully qualified psychologists or psychiatrists could
       supervise if an MSW provider is unavailable. Consider utilizing a Reserve or VA social
       worker to provide supervision for someone whose state requires supervision by an
       individual who is licensed in that state.
       7.10.4.2. As with any privileged provider, an ongoing, proactive peer review process (as
       outlined in Chapter 8) is required. Periodic review of performance is required at least
       biennially as part of the competency-based privileging process. Examples of competency
       assessment include periodic review of a representative sample of medical records, direct
       observation of performance, and verbal/written assessment of clinical knowledge/skills.
7.11. Family Nurse Practitioners.
   7.11.1. Background. Family Nurse Practitioners (FNP) are registered nurses who have
   obtained advanced education, training, and certification to practice independently to provide
   primary healthcare for well and sick individuals from birth to advanced age, including
   pregnant and postpartum women. The FNP practices within a healthcare system that provides

       7.17.4.2. SPAs may be assigned to MTFs where there is no physician of the same
       specialty assigned. In such cases, a staff physician in a specialty most closely overlapping
       that of the SPA should be assigned as preceptor. However, to fully practice in the
       specialty, like-specialty physician consultation must be available by phone or other
       electronic means. Arrangements must be made for one or more physician specialist(s)
       from a military MTF to accomplish ongoing performance review and assessment as
       described in paragraph 7.16.4.4. Arrangements may be made either locally or through
       AFMOA/SGHQ. The specialty preceptor(s) will be identified in Section I of the SPA’s

Section 7D—Non-Privileged Allied Health Professionals (NC, Enlisted, Civilian/Contract
Equivalent)

7.22. Certified Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counselors = Substance Abuse Counselors:
   7.22.1. Background. Mental health technicians serve in clinical roles as Certified Alcohol
   and Drug Abuse Counselors (CADACs) in the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and
   Treatment (ADAPT) Program. They provide services in the following 12 core functions
   outlined by the International Certification and Reciprocity Consortium (ICRC): screening,
   intake, orientation, assessment, treatment planning, counseling, case management, crisis
   intervention, education, referral, report and record keeping, and consultation.
   7.22.2. Education and Certification Requirements:
      7.22.2.1. Have a minimum of 270 hours didactic instruction and 6,000 hours within the
      12 core functions of substance abuse counseling, 300 of which must be accomplished via
      direct supervision by another fully qualified CADAC or privileged mental health
      provider.
      7.22.2.2. Have a signed agreement to practice under strict USAF ethical guidelines.
      Note: Ethical guidelines are state/board specific.
      7.22.2.3. Pass a recognized written examination administered by the USAF.
      7.22.2.4. Obtain nationally recognized certification from the ICRC.
      7.22.2.5. Recertify every three years by obtaining 60 hours continuing professional
      education within the behavioral sciences, as outlined by the AF Substance Abuse
      Counselor Certifying Handbook.
      7.22.2.6. The Air Force Substance Abuse Counselor Certification program issues the
      certification and has the authority to revoke certification for cause.
   7.22.3. Scope of Practice/Supervision:
      7.22.3.1. Perform the 12 core functions independently as directed by the ADAPT
      program manager. Provide treatment planning, crisis intervention, and group treatment
      under the supervision of a privileged mental health provider. For initial assessment,
      development of or changing a treatment plan, and crisis intervention, privileged mental
      health providers are responsible for ―eyes on‖ supervision of CADACs. This is defined as
      direct contact with the patient of sufficient length and interaction to validate the
 134                                                                AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


       assessment and recommendation note made in the chart by the CADAC before the patient
       departs the appointment. Supervising privileged mental health providers must document
       supervision in the medical record following each episode supervised.
       7.22.3.2. The ADAPT program manager is responsible for the clinical practice of
       CADACs and is familiar with the training needs of CADACs working in other areas of
       the mental health career field. Therefore, the ADAPT program manager maintains
       training records of all CADACs working in substance abuse. To ensure ongoing training
       and competency assessment for CADACs, the ADAPT program manager, or designee,
       must observe the CADAC while providing individual or group treatment, at least two
       times per month for a total of at least two hours monthly. Competency assessments will
       focus on direct client contact within the 12 core functions of substance abuse counseling,
       and will be documented in the CADAC’s training record. In fulfilling this requirement,
       the observer and counselor will abide by strict ethical standards.
       7.22.3.3. Non-certified 3-level mental health technicians who are in training may
       conduct the 12 core functions only when supervised by a CADAC or privileged mental
       health provider. They will require direct supervision during the entire patient contact. At
       the discretion of the ADAPTPM following a period of direct observation and evaluation,
       non-certified 5-level and 7-level mental health technicians may conduct the 12 core
       functions without direct supervision. A privileged provider is responsible for eyes-on
       supervision before the patient departs the appointment. Eyes-on supervision is defined as
       direct contact with the patient of sufficient length and interaction to validate the
       assessment and recommendation before the patient departs the appointment. The
       privileged mental health provider who performed this supervision must cosign the note in
       the patient record.
7.23. Registered Dental Hygienists.
   7.23.1. Background. Dental hygienists are licensed professionals who work as members of
   healthcare delivery teams. Hygienists use their knowledge and clinical skills to provide
   preventive, educational, and therapeutic services for patients in all military treatment settings.
   They identify, treat, and/or prevent oral diseases such as dental caries, periodontitis, and oral
   cancer. They also recognize, clinically manage, and arrange for referral of patients for
   medical treatment who have clinical signs and/or symptoms of systemic diseases such as
   diabetes mellitus, nutritional disorder, cardiovascular disease, and AIDS. Hygienists with
   advanced training are capable of performing expanded duties such as administering local
   anesthesia, placing and finishing interim/provisional restorations, and making impressions
   for diagnostic casts.
   7.23.2. Education/Licensure/Certification Requirements:
       7.23.2.1. Dental hygienists must demonstrate appropriate skills, training, and experience
       to be authorized to practice. Minimum educational requirements include:
          7.23.2.1.1. Completion of a dental hygiene certificate program accredited by the
          Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. Most
          dental hygiene programs are located at community colleges and grant an associate
          degree after 2 years of training. However, there are also numerous bachelor and
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                      135


         master’s degree programs at colleges and universities that require an additional 2 to 4
         years of education.
     7.23.2.2. License to practice dental hygiene from a US jurisdiction.
     7.23.2.3. Successful challenge of the National Board Dental Hygiene Examination.
  7.23.3. Scope of Practice. Current dental hygiene practice encourages patient treatment that
  should be approached as a continuous process of care rather than a series of delegated duties
  or procedures. Predetermined clinical protocols and performance standards should be
  established to clearly delineate clinical responsibilities. Following are dental hygiene
  competencies commonly used for practice in most USAF treatment settings:
     7.23.3.1. Complete an evaluation of every patient and formulate a dental hygiene
     diagnosis and treatment plan, in collaboration with the dentist and patient.
     7.23.3.2. Complete preventive treatment and education to promote the values of oral and
     general health and wellness to support population health strategies. Common activities
     include dental prophylaxis, hygiene and tissue indices, tobacco cessation counseling,
     professional topical fluoride treatment, oral health counseling, and application of pit and
     fissure sealants.
     7.23.3.3. Provide specialized treatment designed to achieve and maintain oral health.
     Specialized treatment includes scaling and root planning of tooth surfaces, application of
     local chemotherapeutic agents, control of pain and anxiety, continuous evaluation of the
     patient’s response to therapy, provision of long-term supportive dental care, and
     management of medical emergencies.
     7.23.3.4. Provide community oral health services in a variety of settings, depending on
     the local mission, resources, and opportunities for community involvement. Community
     outreach programs are often associated with special and recurring events such as national
     children’s dental health month, health fairs, oral cancer screening programs, tobacco
     cessation classes, and prenatal counseling programs.
  7.23.4. Supervision:
     7.23.4.1. Dental hygienists function under the indirect or general supervision of a dentist,
     as defined by the American Dental Association. This requires that a dentist must diagnose
     conditions to be treated, must personally authorize the procedures, and must evaluate the
     performance of the dental hygienist and give clinical feedback.
     7.23.4.2. Indirect supervision requires the dentist to be in the clinic or treatment facility
     and to be physically available to provide consultation and oversight. General supervision
     does not require the dentist to remain in the clinic or treatment facility, but the dentist
     must be available for consultation by phone while the hygienist is performing direct
     patient care activities.
     7.23.4.3. The degree of supervision required varies with the nature of the procedure and
     the medical and dental history of the patient. Appropriate levels of supervision must be
     chosen that will not jeopardize the systemic or oral health of the patient.
     7.23.4.4. As with any healthcare professional, an ongoing, proactive peer review process
     and periodic review of performance is required and is accomplished at least annually as
 136                                                             AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


       part of the performance review process. Examples of competency assessment include
       periodic review of a representative sample of dental records, direct observation of
       performance, and verbal/written assessment of clinical knowledge/skills.
7.24. Licensed Registered Nurses.
   7.24.1. Background. Registered Nurses (RNs) have completed education and training in
   professional nursing practice. The American Nurses Association defines nursing as the
   protection, promotion, and optimization of health and abilities, prevention of illness and
   injury, alleviation of suffering through the diagnosis and treatment of human response, and
   advocacy in the care of individuals, families, communities and populations.
   7.24.2. Education/Licensure/Certification Requirements:
       7.24.2.1. Active duty registered nurses must have graduated from a baccalaureate degree
       program in nursing (BSN) accredited by a national nursing accrediting agency recognized
       by the US Department of Education. Registered nurses who are graduates of associate
       degree in nursing (ADN) or diploma programs and do not have a BSN are not eligible
       unless they also have a post-baccalaureate (masters or doctorate) degree in nursing.
       7.24.2.2. Civilian and contract registered nurses must have graduated from an associate
       degree (AD) or a baccalaureate degree program in nursing (BSN) accredited by a national
       nursing accrediting agency recognized by the US Department of Education. By 2020
       entry level to practice in the AF will be at the baccalaureate level of education.
       7.24.2.3. Licensure is addressed in Chapter 4.
       7.24.2.4. National certification by an AF SG1 approved certifying organization is highly

                   COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT AND PEER REVIEW

Section 8A—Competency Assessment

8.1. Staff Competency Assessment. Competency assessment is a continuous process that
includes but is not limited to MTF and work center orientation, license verification, certification
maintenance, in-service training, continuing education and skills/task performance. Competency
assessment is required of all clinical and non-clinical staff members. The MTF staff is defined as
all military (officer and enlisted), civilian, contract, volunteer personnel and to include students
working under educational support agreements. The right skill mix, job knowledge, and
appropriate competency levels of staff are critical factors in providing quality patient care and
customer service. Competence is the ability of a staff member to apply decision-making,
psychomotor, and interpersonal skills at the level of knowledge expected for the current duty
position. Competency is demonstrated by performance in a designated setting, consistent with
established standards of performance that are determined by the work setting and the individual’s
role in that setting.
8.2. MTF Leadership Ensures Appropriate Individual Skill Mix. MTF leadership ensures
individuals with the appropriate skill mix fill the correct role within the organization. The leaders
are responsible for assessing, maintaining, and improving staff competency through an ongoing
series of activities. The education and training staff:
   8.2.1. Provides an organization wide and work center specific orientation for all new staff.
   8.2.2. Assesses and documents current staff competency levels on an on-going basis.
   Competency documentation for all non-privileged staff will be maintained in the
   Competency Assessment Folder (CAF) or an electronic training record such as the Air Force
   Training Record (AFTR) in use by all enlisted personnel.
   8.2.3. Reports the percentage of staff that completes documentation of their competency
   assessment to MTF leadership on a quarterly basis.
   8.2.4. Identifies the competencies, which should include the needs of the patient population,
   types of procedures performed, conditions or diseases treated and equipment used in the
   facility, which each staff member requires to perform the assigned job. Note: Specific
   guidance on competency assessment criteria for enlisted members is found in the respective
   Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP).
   8.2.5. Provides feedback to staff of expectations and objective criteria to perform, improve,
   or enhance job performance. This includes reviewing job descriptions and performance
   standards on an annual basis.
   8.2.6. Implements programs that enable staff to meet the competencies and performance
   standards established by the organization.
   8.2.7. Completes and presents annual status of the training report to the MTF Executive
   Committee for evaluation. The annual training report should include at a minimum, but is not
   limited to, education and training process improvements, status of life support training,
   orientation process and completion, Enlisted Specialty Training (EST), in-service education,
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        141


   competency assessment, Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) training, Independent Duty
   Medical Technician (IDMT) training, other AFSC specific training and continuing education.
8.3. Staff Member Competency Assessment. Each staff member’s competence is assessed by
the organization, usually by the person who directly supervises the individual's day-to-day work.
These assessments are analyzed for patterns or trends. Based upon these trends and analyses,
additional training or education may be needed. Individual competency assessments may indicate
more formal corrective action is needed. The MTF develops and implements a plan when further
individual education or training is indicated.
8.4. Staff Orientation and Ongoing Competency Training. Orientation to the MTF,
continuing education, in-service education, readiness skills verification, work-center specific
competency-based orientation and just-in-time training are provided to assist all staff in
acquiring, maintaining, and improving competence. All staff, throughout their tenure with the
organization, should receive information on new or revised policies, new performance
expectations, new procedures, and training on new equipment.
8.5. Competency Assessment Folder Requirements.
   8.5.1. Non-Privileged Providers. All officer, civilian, contract and volunteer non-privileged
   healthcare staff will maintain a CAF or an electronic equivilant. If the electronic equivalent is
   not accessible to locations where a training folder is required, the CAF will be
   used/maintained IAW location specific requirements. See A2.1. in Attachment 2, Officer,
   Civilian, Contract and Volunteer Personnel (Privileged and Non-Privileged)—
   Competency Assessment Folder guidelines. All enlisted medical personnel (X4XXXXX)
   will utilize the AFTR in lieu of a hard copy competency assessment folder to document
   competency. Documentation guidance for enlisted training is found in AFI 36-2201, Air
   Force Training Program On-The-Job Training Administration, and the individual’s
   respective CFETP. Competency assessment documentation for enlisted personnel will be
   maintained in AFTR.
       8.5.1.1. Active Duty Air Force MTF education and training staff will have a grace period
       of 180 days from the publication date of this AFI to comply with the transition to the
       revised Officer, Civilian, Contract and Volunteer Personnel (Privileged and Non-
       Privileged) — Competency Assessment Folder. The Air Force Reserve Component and
       the Air National Guard will have 365 days from publication date to comply.
   8.5.2. In addition to requirements found in AFI 36-2201, all medical enlisted personnel
   (AFSC X4XXXXX), regardless of assignment or duty location, will also comply with the
   following:
       8.5.2.1. All CMSgts and below will have an active AFTR record. At a minimum, records
       for fully qualified individuals (7 levels and higher), will include work center
       orientation/training documentation on an AF Form 623A, On-The-Job Training Record
       Continuation Sheet, inservice and any applicable recurrent training on AF Forms 1098,
       Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, and any other continuing education
       documentation/certification requirements mandated by the individual's Career Field
       Manager (CFM).
       8.5.2.2. All Senior Noncommissioned Officers (MSgt – CMSgt) who are providing
       patient care will maintain a current specialty training standard (STS) and appropriate AF
142                                                            AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


      Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS, or AF Form 1098
      documentation. All clinical tasks being performed will be signed off on the individual’s
      STS/AF Form 797 or AF Form 1098 in AFTR.
      8.5.2.3. Independent Duty Medical Technicians (IDMTs) Assigned To Non-Medical
      Units.
         8.5.2.3.1. AD IDMTs assigned to non-medical units will be enrolled in AFTR at the
         MTF where sustainment training is accomplished. Unit training managers (UTMs)
         will create IDMT workcenters, assign non-MDG IDMTs to the workcenter and give
         IDMT trainers access to the work center via the Profile II screen in AFTR. This does
         not negate the requirement for an IDMT competency assessment folder IAW AFI 44-
         103, The Air Force IDMT Program.
         8.5.2.3.2. AFRC IDMTs assigned to non-medical units will be enrolled in AFTR and
         assigned to the respective unit. If the unit is not represented in AFTR the IDMT will
         be assigned to an IDMT workcenter in the Aerospace Medicine Flight (AMDF),
         Aerospace Medicine Squadron (AMDS), or Medical Squadron (MDS) on their
         assigned base. Non-medical UTMs will create an IDMT workcenter and will transfer
         IDMT training record to the medical unit UTM where clinical/sustainment training is
         accomplished. Medical UTMs will give IDMT trainers access via Profile Screen II in
         AFTR. This does not negate the requirement for an IDMT competency assessment
         folder IAW AFI 44-103.
  8.5.3. The following items (as applicable) will be scanned (set scanner to lowest legible
  resolution) and attached into AFTR (under the user record tab) medical enlisted personnel
  (AFSC X4XXXXX), regardless of assignment or duty location:
      8.5.3.1. All AF Forms 623A accomplished at the current duty station. Note: Previous
      assignment AF Forms 623A will be uploaded if AF Forms 623A documents training
      received at previous duty assignment and still relevant to current duty position task
      qualification or any historical 623A documentation related to upgrade training if the
      member is still in upgrade training.
      8.5.3.2. AF Form 803, Report of Task Evaluations (Remove IAW AFI 36-2201).

     note documenting the nature of the scanned/deleted document must be made on an AF
     Form 623A. Documents should be individually scanned, dated, and named based on
     document content, e.g., ―CPR card_EXP date_JAN 2010.‖
144                                                             AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


      8.5.4.2. Documentation indicating where the AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health
      Record, is maintained. Annotate, ―The AF Form 55 is maintained in the section safety
      binder.‖ The AF Form 55 will be given to the individual to hand-carry when they deploy
      or permanently change station (PCS).
      8.5.4.3. When personnel PCS, the MTF UTM will transfer the individual’s AFTR file to
      the gaining unit. All base medical enlisted personnel will in and out process with the
      MTF UTM.
      8.5.4.4. When personnel are separating, retiring, retrained to a non-medical AFSC, or
      PCSing to a non AF unit, UTMs will download a copy of the individual’s AFTR file (to
      include all attachments) onto a CD ROM and export (print) a hard copy of the
      individual’s record, to include all attachments. The UTM will give the CD ROM and
      printed record to the member. Once this is completed, the record can be archived within
      AFTR.
  8.5.5. Privileged Providers. Electronic PCFs in CCQAS hold credentialing and privileging
  documents for privileged providers. The electronic PCF is maintained by the MTF CM. The
  6-part PCF is retained and secured by the CM for historical purposes. For detailed
  information on the electronic PCF refer to Section 5E. Provider performance documents are
  maintained in the PAF (reference Attachment 7 for details). Privileged healthcare providers
  will also maintain a two-part CAF, which should be kept by the individual’s clinical
  supervisor in the work center to which the individual is assigned and be made available to the
  individual for periodic update and review. The privileged personnel’s CAF will include those
  mandatory training items not included in the individual’s electronic PCF and PAF. See A2.1.
  in Attachment 2, Officer, Civilian, and Volunteer Personnel (Privileged and Non-
  Privileged) — Competency Assessment Folder.
      8.5.5.1. Competency assessment for initial privileges and biennial renewal is
      accomplished through the credentialing process and is based on performance measures
      established by the MTF Credentials Function (CF).
         8.5.5.1.1. Initial competency assessment is based on documented training and/or
         clinical expertise. Evidence of training includes verifiable items in the AF Form 1540,
         Application for Clinical Privileges/Medical Staff Appointment; AF Form 22, Clinical
         Privileges Evaluation Summary; AF Form 475, Education/Training Report; AF Form
         494, Academic/Clinical Evaluation Report; AF Form 1541, Credentials Continuing
         Health Education Record; and AF Form 1562, Credentials Evaluation of Healthcare
         Practitioners. These forms provide documentary evidence of competency when
         completed by peers, supervisors, and the chief of medical or dental staff as
         appropriate. Optimally letters of recommendation and/or supervised practice should
         be from a peer sharing a similar AFSC or specialty.
         8.5.5.1.2. The biennial credentials renewal process integrates output from
         performance-based determinants collected on an ongoing basis. Examples of these
         elements of performance include analysis of variance derived from focused and
         ongoing professional practice reviews, comparable data analysis, and Executive
         Global Look (EGL) metrics. The PAF acts as a repository for information to be
         reviewed and evaluated but is not appropriate for containment in the electronic PCF.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                      145


Section 8B—Professional Practice Evaluation Process (Applicable to Privileged Providers
Only)

8.6. General.
   8.6.1. Professional practice evaluation or peer review is the evaluation of an individual’s
   professional performance for all relevant performance dimensions using multiple sources of
   performance data. It should include the identification of opportunities to improve care.
   Professional practice evaluation is part of an ongoing performance improvement process that
   ensures competence and improves performance.
   8.6.2. The goal of professional practice evaluation is to improve the overall provision of
   healthcare by assessing competency and analyzing data for evidence-based professional
   practice.
   8.6.3. The dimensions of performance that must be measured include:
       8.6.3.1. Patient Care: Provide patient care that is compassionate, appropriate, and
       effective for the promotion of health, the prevention of illness, the treatment of diseases
       and at the end of life. Measures include how quickly the provider responds to calls,
       timeliness of his or her consultations and whether documentation is thorough, timely and
       legible.
       8.6.3.2. Medical Knowledge: Demonstrate current clinical knowledge and skills. The
       medical staff establishes expectations regarding skills, patient outcomes, and specific
       clinical processes. Use evidence-based guidelines, when available, as recommended by
       the appropriate specialty and approved through the MTF, in selecting the most effective
       and appropriate approaches to diagnosis and treatment.
       8.6.3.3. Practice-based Learning and Improvement: Use scientific evidence and methods
       to investigate, evaluate, and improve patient care.
       8.6.3.4. Interpersonal and Communication Skills: Demonstrate interpersonal and
       communication skills that enable them to establish and maintain professional
       relationships with parents, families, and other healthcare team members.
       8.6.3.5. Professionalism: Act in a professional and respectful manner at all times and
       adhere to a code of conduct. (See Kx Toolkit for a sample code of conduct and operating
       instruction template.) Respond promptly to requests for patient care needs. Completing
       medical records and documentation on time, committee work and attending meetings,
       cooperating with programs such as peer review and credentialing.
       8.6.3.6. Systems-based Practice: Demonstrate both an understanding of the context and
       systems in which healthcare is provided and the ability to apply this knowledge to
       improve and optimize healthcare. Participate in the MTF’s effort and policies to maintain
       a patient safety culture, reduce medical errors, meet National Patient Safety Goals, and
       improve quality.
8.7. Medical Staff Oversight. The Medical Staff is responsible for the Professional Practice
Evaluation Process. The Credentials Function is responsible for monitoring compliance with this
policy and procedures. The Credentials Function receives regular status reports from each
medical director related to the progress of all providers on focused professional practice
 146                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


evaluation (FPPE) and any problems identified during ongoing professional practice evaluation
(OPPE). The SGH will notify the provider in writing of the results of the FPPE and this
review/form is placed in the PAF as outlined in Chapter 5. Feedback from the OPPE will be
reviewed with the provider as described in paragraph 8.9.4. and maintained in the PAF.
8.8. Focused Professional Practice Evaluation (FPPE).
   8.8.1. FPPE provides a process whereby the procedure/privilege specific competence of a
   provider without documented evidence of competently performing the requested privileges at
   the MTF is evaluated. This process may also be used when a question arises regarding a
   currently privileged provider’s ability to provide safe, high-quality patient care. FPPE is a
   time-limited period during which the MTF evaluates and determines the provider’s
   professional performance.
       8.8.1.1. When a provider is granted privileges for the first time, either at initial
       appointment or as a current member of the medical staff, the provider will undergo an
       initial period of focused evaluation. FPPE is required for low volume providers
       requesting renewal of privileges when they next exercise the low volume privilege. FPPE
       is also required when there is a concern regarding the provider’s current competency.
       8.8.1.2. Relevant information resulting from the FPPE process will be integrated into
       performance improvement activities, consistent with policies and procedures that are
       intended to preserve confidentiality and privilege of information.
       8.8.1.3. A provider undergoing FPPE will be notified and informed of the findings and
       any follow-up steps or plans for ongoing monitoring, if indicated.
   8.8.2. A FPPE plan will consider the sources of data and how it will be collected, the
   duration of the monitoring period and reporting the outcomes.
       8.8.2.1. Sources of data and collection:
          8.8.2.1.1. Each department within the privileging organization shall define the
          appropriate monitoring method, number of cases, and duration of proctoring period to
          determine what constitutes a provider’s current competency.
          8.8.2.1.2. This monitoring may be performed using prospective, concurrent, or
          retrospective approaches, as determined to be most appropriate given the provider’s
          education, training, board certification and years of professional practice experience.
          Data can be obtained for all dimensions of provider competence from multiple data
          sources. Data may be individual care specific or rate data from multiple cases.
          Information sources may include: detailed medical records review, monitoring
          clinical patterns, simulation, proctoring, external peer review, on-site interviews or
          TDY of a provider to another location.
          8.8.2.1.3. The data obtained will be recorded in an appropriate proctoring form.
       8.8.2.2. Duration of Monitoring Period. The Credentials Function in conjunction with the
       individual medical directors will establish the criteria and duration of the FPPE. Duration
       should be based on number of records, cases, or procedures reviewed instead of a specific
       timeline. If during this period of FPPE, issues are identified that may result in significant
       deviations from standards of care, the monitoring period may be extended. Similarly, if
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                      147


     initial concerns are raised that require further evaluation or there is insufficient activity
     during that time, the monitoring period may be extended.
     8.8.2.3. For those specialties where another provider may not be available to proctor
     initial procedures, 100% chart review of invasive procedures will be performed during
     the FPPE. For facilities that have single providers practicing a specialty the FPPE can be
     accomplished by sending records to another MTF. If the facility cannot arrange review
     contact the AFMOA SGH consultant for assistance.
     8.8.2.4. The proctor’s role is that of an evaluator, to review and observe cases, not of a
     supervisor or consultant. The proctor must be a member in good standing of the medical
     staff and have unrestricted privileges for the scope of care being proctored. Proctors will
     evaluate sufficient portions of the medical care rendered by the provider to be able to
     judge the quality of care provided in relationship to the privilege(s) requested. In addition
     to specialty and privilege specific issues, proctoring will address the six dimensions of
     performance.
     8.8.2.5. The medical director or designee will determine changes to improve
     performance based on results of FPPEs, including proctoring, and implementation of
     provider-specific performance improvements plans, as appropriate for providers who
     complete the FPPE. The Medical Director will provide a report to the Credentials Office
     once a provider has successfully completed FPPE. (See Kx C&P Toolkit). The
     Credentials Function will be notified of the extension and consideration should be given
     for M&E if the concern requires further evaluation.
  8.8.3. FPPE of a provider’s performance may occur when issues are identified that may
  affect the provision of safe, high-quality medical care. The following criteria may trigger the
  need for this focused evaluation:
     8.8.3.1. There is aggregate, valid, provider-specific data that demonstrates a significant
     adverse variation from internal or external benchmarks or performance.
     8.8.3.2. There is a problematic pattern or trend identified as a result of the OPPE of the
     provider.
     8.8.3.3. There is a serious complaint or quality of care concern raised against the
     provider.
     8.8.3.4. There is evidence of behavior, health, and/or performance issues that carry an
     immediate threat to the health and safety of the patient, public, or other members of the
     healthcare team.
  8.8.4. M&E, as one type of FPPE, is a specific recommendation of the Credentials Function
  when the function is uncertain as to the competency of at least part of a provider’s practice.
     8.8.4.1. M&E is a well defined, time-limited, well-documented plan for FPPE to confirm
     that a provider possesses the requisite knowledge, skill, and training to render safe and
     appropriate patient care within their scope of practice. The plan will include a list of
     specific questions, procedures, and concerns to be evaluated during the period of M&E
     and clear expectations and measures of success. The plan shall be coordinated through
     AFMOA/SGHQ.
 148                                                              AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


       8.8.4.2. M&E consists of a formal monitoring plan for the provider either at the assigned
       MTF or another facility.
       8.8.4.3. The duration of M&E is variable, but often will last 2-3 months.
       8.8.4.4. The supervising peer is expected to conduct constructive feedback with the
       provider throughout the M&E. The progress documentation shall be reviewed bimonthly
       by the SGH with ongoing updates to the Credentials Function. The supervising peer will
       provide a specific written assessment of the skills in question to the Credentials Function
       at the end of the period. (See Kx Toolkit for template.)
       8.8.4.5. The SGH will notify the provider in writing of the results of the M&E and this
       review is placed in the PAF/PCF as outlined in Chapter 5. If the M&E finds concern, an
       adverse action may be initiated if warranted.
8.9. Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation (OPPE).
   8.9.1. OPPE is the continuous evaluation of the provider’s professional performance, rather
   than an episodic evaluation. It is intended to identify and resolve potential performance
   issues as soon as possible, as well as foster a more efficient, evidence based privilege
   renewal system. OPPE allows the MTF to identify professional practice trends that impact on
   quality of care and patient safety. The information, gathered in accordance with the criteria
   established by the medical staff, is integrated into performance improvement activities,
   utilized in maintaining current privileges, revising existing privileges, or, if necessary,
   revoking an existing privilege prior to or at the time of renewal.
   8.9.2. OPPE applies to all military and civilian providers who have been granted privileges
   by the MTF privileging authority. This requirement also applies to deployed providers.
   8.9.3. OPPE will begin immediately after appointment to the staff and provide continuous
   monitoring of providers’ performance. Effective OPPE is the use of systematic measurement,
   evaluation and follow-through. This data shall be used by the credentials function to assess
   clinical currency and to renew provider’s privileges. This information is stored in the PAF
   (see Chapter 5) and is privileged and protected from disclosure under 10 U.S.C. §1102.
   8.9.4. Feedback to the provider will occur at least semiannually. When practice variances
   (both positive and negative) are noted, feedback must occur more frequently. For example,
   when rules (i.e., practice standards) are broken, immediate feedback is warranted along with
   continued review to trend data. If review shows continued deviation from the norm, further
   evaluation and referral to the Credential Function is warranted. With unusual or adverse
   events, immediate review and action is necessary.
   8.9.5. Elements for review may include: pharmacy profiles, medical record completion,
   blood and drug utilization evaluations, known procedure complications, Incident/Adverse
   Event information, morbidity and mortality summaries, infection rates, HEDIS and ORYX
   measures, patient satisfaction/complaints, patient advocacy information and additional
   elements as defined by the clinical department or medical staff.
   8.9.6. There are many sources of performance data and no set number of charts to review.
   The number should be adequate to compare providers, as determined by the SGH or
   department chair. For low volume/high-risk activities, 100% chart review would be
   appropriate. For high volume activities, 5% chart review would be adequate. The provider
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        149


   and departments must receive data and feedback. This information may be obtained through
   periodic medical record review, direct observation, monitoring of diagnostic and treatment
   techniques and/or discussion with other individuals involved in the care of each patient.
   Much of this data can be collected by clinical and administrative support staff. This
   information is stored in the PAF (see Chapter 5) and is privileged and protected from
   disclosure under 10 U.S.C. §1102.
   8.9.7. Summaries of OPPE review and findings will be evaluated by the Credentials
   Function every 6 months and presented to the ECOMS.
8.10. Standard of Care Review (SOC). SOC review is a focused quality of care evaluation of
a specific case. It is initiated in response to a concern about the SOC in a specific case. As such,
it results in a specific SOC determination of ―met, not met or indeterminate‖ by the reviewer. A
peer is defined as someone of the same AFSC or specialty. This peer may be within or outside of
the MTF. The provider must be notified before the SOC review is initiated and must be notified
of the results. The SGH will notify the provider in writing of the results of the SOC and this
redacted review is placed in the PAF/PCF as outlined in Chapter 5. A result of ―not met‖ may
necessitate a FPPE and uncommonly initiate an adverse action. Morbidity and Mortality
conferences could be the basis for a formal SOC review that would be reported separately.
8.11. Expert Review. Expert Review is an external quality of care review with a SOC
determination of a specific case in preparation for a malpractice case against the government.
The Air Force Legal Operations Agency, Tort Litigation Division (AFLOA/JACC) directs expert
reviews (reference Chapter 10).

Section 8C—Non-Privileged Providers (NPP) Peer Review Process

8.12. General. Peer Review is the activity of looking objectively at the quality of care and
practice of a NPP. This is accomplished by peers looking at performance-based clinical practice,
records and other applicable data. There are two main types of peer review: proactive and
responsive. Proactive review is ongoing and is designed to monitor and validate if NPPs are
providing safe and effective healthcare and to potentially identify healthcare related problems
early, including individual and system performance improvement opportunities. Responsive peer
review occurs after a clinical competency problem has been suspected or identified. The
concepts of peer review are applicable across all disciplines and should be applied as
appropriate. The respective Senior Corps Representatives and Enlisted Functional Managers are
responsible for peer review in the medical treatment facilities. Peer reviews are privileged and
protected from disclosure under 10 U.S.C. §1102.
8.13. Proactive Peer Review.
   8.13.1. Clinical Skills Review. A clinical skills review is routine and not adverse in nature.
   This review focuses on individual clinical performance and is performed by a peer. A peer is
   an individual with similar education, experience and background. An example is an
   ambulatory care nurse reviewing telephone triage encounters of another ambulatory care
   nurse against approved telephone triage protocols. Criteria for review should be selected by
   the local MTF.
   8.13.2. Criteria must be clinical and defined by current standards of practice/care (i.e.,
   approved Telephone Triage protocols/guidelines; or local Support Staff Protocols). NPP peer
 150                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   review should occur quarterly. Reviews can either be random charts or more focused in
   nature. There is no set number of charts to review; however, the number should be adequate
   to assess clinical skills in a specific area (not for statistical analysis). For low volume/high-
   risk activities, 100% chart reviews might be appropriate. For high volume activities 5% chart
   review might be adequate. Results of clinical skills review should be presented to the
   individual reviewed, Senior Corps Representative, and the Enlisted Functional Manager, if
   applicable. This information should be stored in the individual’s Competency Assessment
   Folder (CAF), or on AF IMT 803, Report on Task Evaluations, in the enlisted Air Force
   Training Record (AFTR).
   8.13.3. For facilities that have single NPPs in a particular specialty (i.e., Clinical Case
   Manager or Allergy/Immunizations Technician) clinical skills review can be accomplished
   by establishing an agreement with another MTF to conduct the peer review. It may also be
   conducted with an agreement with another military service MTF. If the facility cannot
   arrange an entity to conduct their peer review, it should contact the MAJCOM/AFMOA
   functional for assistance.
8.14. Responsive Review. Responsive reviews are accomplished in response to any concern
related to clinical performance. These reviews are done in coordination with the Senior Corps
Representative, the Enlisted Functional Manager, if applicable, and the SGH. Responsive
reviews consist of individual practice reviews, standards of care reviews, and expert peer
reviews.
   8.14.1. Individual Practice Review (IPR) is a peer review of an individual’s practice through
   records, on-site interviews and observations. It may be independent or part of an inquiry.
   8.14.2. Standard of Care Review (SOC) is a peer review of a specific incident of care and is
   initiated in response to a concern about individual clinical performance and a potential
   breach in the standard of care.
   8.14.3. Expert Peer Review is an external peer review of a specific incident of care in
   preparation for a medical malpractice case against the government. Expert peer reviews are
   arranged with the Expert Peer Review Manager in AFMOA, Risk Management Operations.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        151


                                            Chapter 9

     ADVERSE CLINICAL, ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS RELATED TO THE
  PROVISION OF HEALTHCARE AND RELATED PROFESSIONAL STAFF ISSUES

Section A—Overview of Clinical Adverse Actions

9.1. General. This section describes the management of clinical adverse actions for both
privileged and non-privileged providers. A clinical adverse action is an action invoked against a
healthcare provider (privileged or non-privileged), where the authority to practice healthcare for
the AFMS is adversely affected. This action is taken in response to a threat to patient safety or to
the integrity (bring discredit or unfavorable scrutiny) of the AFMS related to clinical
incompetence, professional misconduct, or impairment. The process has five steps: inquiry
period/quality assurance investigation as needed, professional review process (credentials
function or other peer review function), hearing procedures, appeal procedures through the
Medical Practice Review Board (MPRB), and final AF/SG review. See detailed flowchart on the
adverse actions process posted on the AFMOA/SGHQ website. AFMOA/SGHQ will provide
consultative support to the MTF. AFMOA/CC will ensure compliance with this policy by the
MTFs. Note: All documents generated pursuant to the adverse action process are quality
assurance documents. Therefore, the documents are protected IAW Title 10 U.S.C. §1102. These
documents will be labeled, citing this statute. Do not release these documents without proper
authority.
9.2. Differentiate Clinical and Administrative Adverse Actions. MTF/CC and their local
SJA and MLC, in consultation with AFMOA/SGHQ, will ensure that a clinical adverse action is
taken, when appropriate. Clinical adverse actions are considered appropriate when there is
evidence of incompetence, unprofessional conduct, or impairment that could or has created a risk
to patient(s)/staff safety or to the integrity of the AFMS. For example, evidence may indicate
deficits in competence (medical knowledge, expertise, or judgment); conduct (e.g., disruptive
behavior that negatively affects the working environment for staff and/or patients,
unprofessional, unethical, or criminal conduct); or impairment (medical conditions, mental
health conditions, or alcohol/drug abuse/dependence) that reduce or prevent the provider’s ability
to safely execute his or her responsibilities in providing safe healthcare. Matters that do not meet
these criteria shall be handled administratively. Administrative adverse action may be taken
against the provider in addition to a clinical adverse action. See Attachment 9 for examples of
administrative adverse actions. Contact the SJA or MLC for advice. Note: When the MTF
consults with legal and AFMOA/SGHQ regarding the management of an adverse action and
receives conflicting guidance a telecon must be held between the MTF, legal and
AFMOA/SGHQ to discuss the case to ensure the MTF/CC has information needed upon which
to base a decision.
   9.2.1. A clinical adverse action must be taken when appropriate, regardless of the
   individual’s contract or other duty status within the MTF. Severing the employment
   relationship (to include PCS, separation, resignation, or retirement), or negotiating a
   contractual/employment settlement in lieu of taking an adverse action that is indicated, is not
   appropriate.
 152                                                              AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   9.2.2. Clinical adverse actions are taken by the MTF privileging authority and follows the
   MTF service chain of command regardless of the provider’s service affiliation. The Surgeon
   General responsible for the MTF taking the adverse action will make the final decision and
   direct reporting to the NPDB and other regulatory agencies as appropriate. See paragraph
   9.38.2. for additional information regarding processing an adverse action on members from
   other services.
9.3. Purpose of Taking Clinical Adverse Actions:
   9.3.1. To protect our patients.
   9.3.2. To enhance the quality of care and protect the integrity of the AFMS.
   9.3.3. To protect the rights of the provider(s) pending adverse actions.
   9.3.4. To ensure timely resolution of the issues.
   9.3.5. To allow timely reporting of individuals to professional regulatory agencies if
   required.
9.4. Consult with Legal Counsel. Prior to proceeding with any action listed in this section, for
either privileged or non-privileged providers, consultation shall occur with the wing SJA and
regional MLC. This will ensure compliance with due process requirements. This includes
invoking an abeyance, conducting investigations/inquiries, removing a provider from patient
care, and all notification letters.
9.5. Coordination with MTF Executive Leadership. Coordination of the action shall occur
amongst the appropriate MTF executive leadership. For example, if an action against a
privileged advanced practice nurse is contemplated, the clinical supervisor, SQ/CC, SGN,
Credentials Function Chairperson (SGH), and MTF/CC will be key personnel involved in the
action.
9.6. Early Notifications:
   9.6.1. Notify AFMOA/SGHQ at the onset of the inquiry or adverse action process for
   guidance on procedures and plan of action. AFMOA/SGHQ key personnel include the SGHs,
   Chief, Risk Management Operations, and Chief, Professional Staff Management.
   9.6.2. Federal Civil Service Employees: Consult with the employee relations specialist
   (Civilian Personnel Office) when an adverse action involving a civil service employee is
   contemplated. This consultation must be done to ensure that civilian employee guidelines are
   met.
   9.6.3. Contract Employees: If an inquiry or adverse action invoking a contract employee is
   contemplated, consult with the contracting officer and Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP) as
   the action is initiated, IAW the provisions of the contract.
   9.6.4. Host Nation Providers: If an inquiry or adverse action against a host nation contract
   employee is contemplated, consult with the contracting officer as the action is initiated, IAW
   the provisions of the contract. National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) reporting is not
   applicable; however, a report shall be placed in the Defense Practitioner Data Bank (DPDB).
   All due process procedures herein apply.

9.8. Providers Ending Affiliation with the Air Force Medical Service after Initiation of an
Abeyance or an Adverse Action.
   9.8.1. The MTF/CC must inform individuals who separate or end affiliation with the AFMS
   while under an abeyance or an adverse action review in writing of the implications of their
   actions and their right to request the due process procedures to be continued. Note: If the
   provider has already been notified, in writing, of the implications of leaving, then it is not
   necessary to repeat this notification.
   9.8.2. The provider may ask that due process procedures be continued after the change in his
   or her employment status with the AFMS or MTF. If the provider chooses to have the due
   process continued, he or she must send a written request to the MTF/CC within 10 calendar
   days following his or her knowledge of the change in affiliation status. A report is not made
   to regulatory agencies until due process procedures are complete, and the final action is a
   reportable action.
   9.8.3. If the provider chooses not to continue the adverse action due process, the MTF/CC’s
   decision becomes the final action and is forwarded to AFMOA/SGHQ for review and
   reporting as indicated.
9.9. Adverse Actions for Providers No Longer Affiliated with MTF. Adverse actions may be
considered for up to 12 months following cessation of a provider’s affiliation with an MTF for
 156                                                              AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


issues that arose during the time the provider had practiced at that MTF. The MTF will notify the
provider of the allegations under review and will give the provider the opportunity to provide
information on his or her behalf. All due process procedures within this instruction apply. If the
MTF has closed, AFMOA/SGHQ assumes responsibility for the action.
9.10. Air Reserve Components (ARC). When a ARC provider (privileged or non-privileged)
practicing in an AFMS unit or facility displays evidence of incompetence, professional
misconduct, or impairment that affects the safety of patients or the integrity of the AFMS, the
due process procedures in the instruction apply. The appropriate active duty Senior Corps
Representative/Credential Function Chairperson will coordinate with the appropriate reserve
counterpart throughout the adverse action process.
9.11. Theater of Operations. If an adverse action is being considered on a privileged or non-
privileged provider in the theater of operations, the deployed MTF/CC will consider all available
information found during a QA investigation and make the decision on whether to return the
provider to the MTF from which the provider was deployed (permanent station) for definitive
action. Due to resource constraints in the theater of operations, adverse action due process is
conducted by the permanent station MTF. The deployed MTF/CC will forward all evidence and
recommendations to the permanent station MTF/CC. The permanent station MTF/CC will
review the information to consider an appropriate action. The provider will be automatically
placed in abeyance while non-privileged providers will be removed from practice upon return to
duty at the permanent station MTF, during which time an inquiry will be conducted. When a
deployed ARC member is returned to the ARC unit from the theater of operations, the ARC Unit
Commander/Senior Corps Representative/Credentials Function Chairperson will coordinate with
the respective HQ AFRC/SGP/HQ NGB/SG to conduct a QA investigation and initiate a clinical
adverse action process as prescribed in this instruction.
9.12. Actions Involving the Medical Group Commander. When information arises on a
privileged MTF/CC’s conduct or condition, which affects his or her ability to practice safe
healthcare, the Credentials Function Chairperson will notify AFMOA/SGHQ. AFMOA/CC will
initiate the adverse action following coordination with the HQ MAJCOM/SG and be responsible
for the due process procedures. The HQ MAJCOM/SG will notify the commanding line officer.
All non-clinical issues involving the MTF/CC will be managed by the commanding line officer.
9.13. All providers practicing within an AFMS MTF will be subject to the adverse action
process prescribed within this instruction. Air Force providers privileged or granted the right
to practice by other entities (e.g., other DoD services, Department of Veterans Affairs, and
civilian entities [External Resource Sharing Agreements], Training Affiliation Agreements) are
subject to the adverse action bylaws of that entity.
   9.13.1. When an adverse privileging action is being considered on a contract employee (to
   include host nation contract employees) consult with the assigned Quality Assurance
   personnel assigned to the contract and medical logistics/base contracting office when the
   action is initiated IAW the provisions of the contract.
9.14. Use of Timelines. All timelines will be specified in calendar days. If the final day for any
specified timeline falls on a weekend or Federal holiday, the timeline will be extended to the
next business/duty day for the MTF. Timelines are designed to allow a provider adequate time to
prepare for a hearing and to facilitate timely resolution of the adverse action. The MTF/CC may
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                          157


grant timeline extensions on the provider’s behalf for good cause. The AFMOA/CC may grant
summary suspension extension after review by AFMOA/SGHQ.

Section 9B—Clinical Adverse Actions for a Privileged Provider

9.15. General. When a privileged provider’s conduct, condition, or performance requires
immediate action to protect the safety of patient(s)/staff or the integrity (threat to discredit or
bring unfavorable scrutiny) of the AFMS, the Credentials Function Chairperson shall remove the
provider from patient care duties (abeyance/summary suspension) in accordance with the
provisions below while a QA investigation is conducted. The QA investigation allows gathering
of factual information regarding the extent of the issues affecting the provider’s ability to safely
practice healthcare. If a QA investigation is not needed because the evidence (substantive matter)
is obvious, the Credentials Function Chairperson will forward the information to the credentials
function for review and due process procedures will continue accordingly. Prior to the issuance
of any notification under this section, coordination with the appropriate legal office will be
accomplished.
   9.15.1. While under abeyance or summary suspension of all clinical privileges, the provider
   will not be reassigned to other clinical duties (another clinic seeing patients, etc.), a different
   MTF, or PCS’d to another MTF. In cases of abeyance or summary suspension of a portion of
   the provider’s privileges, the provider may continue those privileges not affected by the
   abeyance or summary suspension.
   9.15.2. Withdrawal of Permission to Engage in Off-Duty Employment. The MTF/CC or
   designee will withdraw any permission for the provider to engage in clinically-related off-
   duty employment from initiation of abeyance or summary suspension until all due process
   procedures are completed.
       9.15.2.1. The MTF/CC will notify other MTFs or civilian medical treatment facilities
       where the provider is practicing, as identified in the provider’s off-duty employment
       request, when the abeyance or adverse action is initiated.
       9.15.2.2. The MTF/CC must withdraw permission for off-duty employment, if a provider
       is being investigated for any item listed in Attachment 9.
       9.15.2.3. New applications for off-duty employment, during any adverse action review,
       will not be approved until the privileges of the individual have been restored.
   9.15.3. As part of the notification process, the MTF/CC notifies the contracting officer for
   contract providers or the Civilian Personnel Office for a federal civilian employee.
   9.15.4. Contract (including host nation contract employees). If an adverse practice action is
   being considered on a contract employee, consult with the assigned Quality Assurance
   personnel assigned to the contract and medical logistics/base contracting office when the
   action is initiated IAW the provisions of the contract. (See paragraph 6.21. for details on
   managing contract providers).
Privileged Provider—Inquiry/Quality Assurance (QA) Investigation Step, Invoking an Abey-
ance and/or Summary Suspension
9.16. Invoking an Abeyance. An abeyance is not an adverse privilege action; however, the
provider is formally ―on notice‖ that an investigation into his or her practice has begun that may
 158                                                                AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


result in a clinical adverse action or other administrative action. If the provider’s privileges are
due to expire during the abeyance, the affected privileges do not lapse. Therefore, no renewal
action will be taken on the affected privileges. The affected privileges are considered ―static‖
during the abeyance. Unaffected privileges may be renewed if appropriate. Abeyance is used
when available information may be insufficient to summarily suspend privileges or the potential
risk to patient safety is not well understood, yet prudence dictates that the provider not render
patient care until the quality investigation and its review is complete. It is normally imposed by
the Credentials Function Chairperson, under the direction of the MTF/CC. It is valid for 30
calendar days. If the QA investigation is not complete and the MTF/CC has not made a
disposition on the provider’s privileges within the 30-day period of abeyance, the abeyance
automatically becomes a summary suspension.
   9.16.1. Provider Notification. The provider is notified, in writing, by the Credentials
   Function Chairperson, that his or her privileges have been placed in abeyance (including the
   basis and duration for the action), and that a QA investigation is being conducted (see
   Attachment 10). If only a portion of the provider’s clinical privileges are being placed in
   abeyance, the notification letter must state what privileges are affected. The notification to
   the provider must state that the findings of the QA investigation will be reviewed by the
   Credentials Function. In addition, the notification must state if the abeyance is not resolved
   within 30 calendar days, or if the provider ends his or her relationship with the MTF and has
   not requested a continuation of the due process, the abeyance will become a summary
   suspension. Note: During the period of abeyance the provider shall not practice under the
   privileges affected, even under supervision.
9.17. QA Investigation Procedures. The QA investigation is initiated by the MTF/CC or
designee, when needed to investigate any allegations of clinical incompetence, misconduct, or
impairment. An investigating officer is appointed in writing (may be appointed by MTF/CC,
SGH, or other appropriate MTF executive leader) and should be a peer (similar clinical
privileges/specialty, education, and training) of the provider under investigation. The SGH
cannot serve as the investigating officer. The MTF may consult with AFMOA/SGHQ to seek
assistance with the investigating officer appointment. For example, an investigating officer may
be an independent reviewer from another MTF. The purpose and scope of the QA investigation
will be explicit in the written appointment. After completing the QA investigation the
investigating officer will submit a written report to the Credentials Function for review. The
report will organize the factual findings of the QA investigation, and include the investigating
officer's conclusions and recommendations. The QA investigation report and other relevant
information collected will form the basis of the credential’s function review.
9.18. Command Directed Evaluations. For military members a Command-directed evaluation
(CDE) may be necessary to evaluate a mental condition that could be affecting the provider’s
ability to practice safely. If the provider’s mental health status is in question then it shall be
evaluated via a CDE, as appropriate. The commander directed mental health evaluation will be
conducted IAW AFI 44-109, Mental Health, Confidentiality, and Military Law. It may be
necessary to have the evaluation completed at a different MTF to remove any appearance of bias.
9.19. Disclosure of Abeyance. An abeyance is not a reportable action, nor is it an adverse
action the provider must self-report or disclose as an adverse action.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                       159


9.20. Invoking a Summary Suspension. Summary suspension is a temporary clinical adverse
action used to protect patient/staff safety or the integrity of the AFMS while an investigation is
ongoing. If a provider under abeyance is not reinstated within 30 calendar days, the abeyance
automatically becomes a summary suspension. In cases where the provider’s misconduct,
clinical incompetence, or impairment is obvious and poses a significant threat to patient safety or
well being, summary suspension shall be the initial action. Summary suspensions may be
imposed by the MTF/CC or delegated to the Credentials Function Chairperson. If the provider’s
privileges are due to expire during the summary suspension, the affected privileges do not lapse.
Therefore, no renewal action will be taken on the affected privileges. Note: During the period of
summary suspension the provider shall not practice under the privileges affected, even under
supervision.
   9.20.1. Provider Notification. The provider will be notified, in writing, by the Credentials
   Function Chairperson, that the provider’s clinical privileges have been summarily suspended,
   and that the basis for the summary suspension be reviewed by the Credentials Function
   (Attachment 11). If only a portion of the provider’s clinical privileges are being summarily
   suspended, the notification letter must identify those privileges that are suspended. The
   summary suspension notification letter should state the implications of leaving the service or
   employment while a clinical adverse action is underway. A summary suspension remains in
   effect for up to 6 months. A request (for good cause) to extend the summary suspension
   beyond 6 months must be sent through AFMOA/SGHQ to the AFMOA/CC or designee for
   approval.
   9.20.2. Disclosure of Summary Suspension. A summary suspension is a clinical adverse
   action and, therefore, it may be necessary for a provider to disclose this action to any agency
   inquiring about suspensions or adverse clinical actions. This includes applications for future
   privileges, licensure/certification/registration, or insurance. When disclosure is required, the
   summary suspension must be disclosed even if the provider’s privileges were reinstated. The
   Credentials Function Chairperson shall advise the provider of this requirement.
9.21. Notification to HQ MAJCOM/SG. The MTF notifies HQ MAJCOM/SG and
AFMOA/SGHQ when a provider’s privileges are placed in summary suspension. The MTF must
initiate a DD Form 2499 to document the action. This form shall be placed in the adverse action
file and a copy in the electronic PCF.
   9.21.1. Notification of adverse actions of a sensitive or potentially notorious nature:
   MTF/CC will ensure AFMOA/SGHQ and HQ MAJCOM/SG are notified. AFMOA/CC will
   be responsible for providing information to HQ USAF/SG leadership, as appropriate.
   9.21.2. Notification for Contract (including Host Nation contract) Providers. If the provider
   is a member of a contract group, the Credentials Function Chairperson shall provide a copy
   of the notification letter, and any subsequent correspondence, to the contracting officer.
   9.21.3. Notification for Federal Civilian Providers. If the provider is a Federal civilian
   provider, the Credentials Function Chairperson shall provide a copy of the notification letter
   and any subsequent correspondence, to the Civilian Personnel Office (CPO). CPO shall be
   kept informed throughout the adverse action process.
Credentials Function Review (CFR)

9.22. General. Professional review activities for privileged providers are performed by the
Credentials Function. This review may be conducted by an ad hoc sub-committee ensuring
appropriate impartial representatives with appropriate peer composition (at least one peer, which
is a provider with similar awarded privileges/clinical specialty, level of training and experience,
may be assigned to a different MTF). The role of the credentials function is to examine
information obtained from the QA investigation, CDE if accomplished, and/or other sources
(e.g., OSI report), and to make recommendations to the MTF/CC regarding the provider’s ability
to safely execute their clinical privileges. The focus of this professional review must be on the
facts/evidence of the clinical deficits/incompetence, misconduct, or impairment that impact the
provider’s ability to practice safely. The provider under review does not have the right to attend
the meeting; however, the provider may be asked to provide a written statement. The provider is
free to consult with legal counsel at any step in an adverse action; however, the credentials
function is not a legal proceeding.
9.23. Composition of the Credentials Function. The credentials function must be composed
of at least three privileged providers. At least one provider shall be a peer (similar awarded
privileges/clinical specialty, level of training and experience) of the individual who is the subject
of the action. Providers from a different MTF may participate via video teleconferencing, audio,
or in person to meet this requirement, and/or to add objectivity to the review. These providers
must have the same ability to review all information/evidence as the providers physically present
at the Credentials Function meeting.
9.24. Ensuring Impartiality in Credentials Function. The Credentials Function review
process is a professional practice review. Personnel participating in the review must be able to
impartially review the case. In an adverse action case, the personnel listed below will not
participate in the credentials function review:
   9.24.1. The individual’s direct supervisor.
   9.24.2. Subordinates of the provider under review.
   9.24.3. The individual who summarily suspended or placed the provider’s privileges in
   abeyance, or who recommended the provider’s discharge from active duty.
   9.24.4. Investigation officers.
   9.24.5. Any person whose testimony plays a significant part in the case.
   9.24.6. Any officer/provider who is participating, or has participated, in other administrative
   proceedings (courts-martial board or administrative review board) regarding the provider
   under review.
   9.24.7. Any member who is reviewing, or has reviewed, the provider’s actions under
   consideration by the Credentials Function.
9.25. Credentials Function Recommendations. The credentials function considers the QA
Investigation report and recommends an action to the MTF/CC regarding the provider’s clinical
privileges. If additional information is required, they may refer the case back to the
investigator(s) for further inquiry. The Credentials Function Review process is deliberative in
nature and the documents reflecting the deliberation are protected from release (i.e., the
deliberations are not disclosed to the provider, only the findings and recommendations and the
allegations considered). The Credentials Function Chairperson may make other
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                          161


recommendations under separate cover, to the MTF/CC. Credentials Function recommendations
will be forwarded to the MTF Commander within 10 calendar days of function review
completion and may include:
   9.25.1. Reinstatement. The return of the provider’s regular clinical privileges.
   9.25.2. Reinstatement with Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). M&E is a well-defined,
   time-limited, well documented plan for Focused Professional Practice Evaluation to confirm
   that a provider possesses the requisite knowledge, skill, and training to render safe and
   appropriate patient care within their scope of practice. It must include a documented plan (list
   of concerns/procedures to be evaluated during the period of M&E) with delineation of clear
   expectations and clear measures of success that shall be coordinated through
   AFMOA/SGHQ. The progress documentation shall be reviewed bimonthly by the SGH and
   by an ad hoc credentials function as necessary. Note: M&E is not a substitute for retraining.
   M&E is distinct from supervised practice since there is no restriction or control placed on the
   provider’s clinical practice. It is a period to monitor the provider’s practice and give
   feedback. It is not reportable to the NPDB. Providers shall acknowledge the conditions of the
   M&E in writing.
   9.25.3. Convene a peer review panel.
9.26. MTF/CC Action on Credentials Function Recommendations.
   9.26.1. The MTF/CC has 10 calendar days from receipt of the Credentials Function
   recommendations to determine what action to take; reinstate, reinstate with M&E, or convene
   a peer review panel. The MTF/CC is not bound by the recommendation(s) of the Credentials
   Function.
   9.26.2. If not previously invoked, the MTF/CC may place the provider in summary
   suspension while the process continues. The provider is given written notice of the summary
   suspension. If the MTF/CC is convening a Peer Review Panel, the provider will receive
   written notification (see Attachment 12) of such and be provided a copy of the
   documentation (evidence) that will be reviewed by the Peer Review Panel.
   9.26.3. The MTF/CC will provide written notification to the provider of his/her decision
   (reinstate, reinstate with M&E, or convene a peer review panel). The MTF/CC will provide
   written rationale for any action different from the Credentials Function. If the provider is a
   contractor, a copies of the notification letter are sent to the AF contracting office responsible
   for the contract and to the contract employer. For a Federal civilian provider, a copy of the
   letter is sent to the employee relations specialist (or other point of contact if specified) in the
   CPO.
   9.26.4. The provider must have access to all information considered by the Credentials
   Function during the review process. Copies of these records are releasable to the provider
   and his/her legal counsel. They are released under protection of the Privacy Act of 1974,
   Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (Title II) of 1996 and Title 10 U.S.C.
   §1102.
9.27. Peer Review Panel. The Peer Review Panel will be composed of at least three clinical
peers of the involved provider (similar clinical specialty, education, and training). If the MTF
 162                                                                AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


does not have three peers available to conduct this review, it may be accomplished using peers
from other MTFs; either in person or via video or teleconferencing.
   9.27.1. The provider may provide written comments to the Peer Review Panel, but does not
   have the right to attend this meeting. The peer review panel is not a legal proceeding.
   9.27.2. The Peer Review Panel will convene within 14 calendar days after receipt of the
   MTF/CC’s decision, the QA investigation and relevant evidence to make and forward a
   recommendation to the Credentials Function.
   9.27.3. The recommendations may include:
       9.27.3.1. Reinstatement. (See paragraph 9.25.1. for definition.)
       9.27.3.2. Reinstatement with M&E. (See paragraph 9.25.2. for definition.)
       9.27.3.3. Restriction. Restriction is a temporary or permanent limit placed on all or a
       portion of the provider’s clinical privileges, so that the provider is required to obtain
       concurrence before providing all or some healthcare procedures within the scope of
       his/her certification, license, or registration. The restriction requires some form of
       supervision. Restriction of privileges is reportable to the NPDB.
       9.27.3.4. Reduction. Reduction is the permanent removal of a portion of a provider’s
       clinical privileges. Reduction of privileges is reportable to the NPDB.
       9.27.3.5. Revocation. Revocation is the permanent removal of all of the provider’s
       clinical privileges and the provider is removed from all patient care duties. Revocation is
       reportable to the NPDB.
       9.27.3.6. Denial. Denial of privileges is the refusal to grant any or all of the provider-
       requested clinical privileges. This may occur at initial application for privileges or when
       renewal of privileges is requested. Denial of privileges is reportable to the NPDB.
9.28. Credentials Function. The Credentials Function will reconvene within 10 calendar days
to review the Peer Review Panel’s findings and recommendations, and then forward its final
recommendation to the MTF/CC. The available recommendations are the same as set forth in
paragraph 9.27 above.
   9.28.1. The MTF/CC will give written notification (within 10 days of receipt of Credentials
   Function final recommendation) to the provider of the MTF/CC’s proposed action and the
   basis (allegations) for the action. If the proposed action is to restrict, reduce, revoke, or deny
   the provider’s privileges; then the MTF/CC must advise the provider of his/her right to a
   hearing and appeal rights in writing. The provider must have access to all information
   considered by the Credentials Function and the MTF/CC, which resulted in the basis of the
   proposed action.
9.29. Hearing Process. Any provider whose clinical privileges the MTF/CC intends to deny,
reduce, restrict, or revoke is entitled to a hearing. The provider has 30 calendar days after receipt
of the clinical adverse action notification letter to request a hearing. The commander may extend
this time period if appropriate. The provider may participate in person, through a representative,
and/or by other means (e.g., written deposition or teleconferencing) at their expense.
   9.29.1. If no hearing request is received in 30 calendar days (or allotted time), or the
   individual gives written notice waiving his or her right to a hearing, then hearing rights are
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        163


   waived. When the hearing is waived the appeal rights are also waived. If hearing rights are
   waived, then the MTF/CC acts on the provider’s privileges as proposed and communicates
   this action, to the provider in writing. This is the MTF/CC final action. The MTF/CC will
   forward two copies of the case to AFMOA/SGHQ. AFMOA/SGHQ will review, ensure
   completeness, and prepare a case summary for the HQ MAJCOM/SG and AFMOA/CC. The
   case file is then sent to Chief, Risk Management Operations for coordination to the AF/SG,
   who directs reporting to appropriate agencies as required. Adverse actions without an appeal
   are not reviewed or deliberated by the MPRB.
   9.29.2. If the provider requested a hearing but fails to appear for the scheduled hearing, the
   MTF/CC may choose to proceed with the hearing or consider the hearing waived and act on
   the provider’s privileges as intended in the written notice of the proposed action. The appeal
   rights are also considered waived.
       9.29.2.1. The MTF/CC will then notify the provider, and forward two copies of the case
       to AFMOA/SGHQ, who will prepare and send a case summary to the HQ MAJCOM/SG
       and AFMOA/CC. The case is then sent to Risk Management Operations who will
       coordinate to the AF/SG and report to appropriate agencies as directed. Note: For
       providers working in other services’ MTFs the adverse action process follows the Service
       chain of command of the involved MTF. The provider’s service SG office will be
       provided information throughout the process. Before the MTF’s service SG makes the
       final decision, the case file will be forwarded to AFMOA/SGHQ. AFMOA/SGHQ will
       prepare a summary of the case for the HQ MAJCOM/SG (if the provider is also working
       in AF MTF) and AFMOA/CC. AFMOA/SGHQ will coordinate input to be provided to
       the MTF’s service SG who will make the final decision and direct reporting to the NPDB
       and other regulatory agencies.
9.30. Provider Notification of Hearing. If the provider requests a hearing, the MTF/CC or
chairperson of the credentials function gives the provider written notice of the hearing within 10
calendar days from the date of the provider’s request. (see Attachment 14). This written notice
must include:
   9.30.1. The date, time, and location of the hearing, which must be no sooner than 30
   calendar days from the date of the notification, but scheduled within 60 calendar days. (This
   gives the provider an opportunity to prepare for the hearing.)
   9.30.2. The right to have a military counsel (Area Defense Counsel) appointed to assist the
   provider (if the provider is military). In addition the provider may hire a representative or be
   represented by another person of the provider’s choice at their own expense.
   9.30.3. The provider’s right to present evidence and to call witnesses. The provider must
   arrange for the presence of his or her witnesses at his or her own expense.
   9.30.4. The names of MTF’s witnesses to be called to testify at the hearing. The right to
   cross-examine these witnesses. The provider shall disclose the names and contact
   information for all witnesses testifying on his or her behalf within 15 calendar days of the
   date the provider was notified of the hearing date.
   9.30.5. The provider may request a delay of the hearing for good cause. Absent compelling
   circumstances (i.e., severe illness) delays will not be granted if the request is received by the
   SGH less than 5 calendar days prior to a scheduled hearing. The credentials function
 164                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   chairperson evaluates the request and determines whether or not to grant a delay. The
   chairperson will promptly notify the provider, in writing, of his or her decision and the new
   date/time of the hearing, if changed.
   9.30.6. Hearing is closed and confidential.
9.31. Hearing Panel Composition. When a hearing is requested, the Credentials Function
Chairperson will appoint a hearing panel in writing. The provider will be notified of the hearing
panel composition prior to the start of the hearing. The senior ranking member of the panel will
act as chairperson unless otherwise designated in the appointment letter. To facilitate an
impartial review, members who participated in the Credentials Function review or Peer Review
Panel will not be appointed to the hearing panel. In smaller facilities with limited staff, hearing
panel members may be requested from other MTFs. The panel will include a minimum of three
privileged providers. At least one member shall be a professional peer (with similar awarded
privileges, clinical specialty, and level of training and experience) as the provider under review.
   9.31.1. If the MTF/CC is the provider being evaluated, or is disqualified from acting in the
   case, the AFMOA/CC will coordinate with the HQ MAJCOM/SG before designating a
   senior physician to act as the privileging authority for the case. The personnel listed below
   shall not serve on the hearing committee:
       9.31.1.1. The individual’s direct supervisor.
       9.31.1.2. Subordinates of the provider under review.
       9.31.1.3. The individual who placed the provider in abeyance or summarily suspended
       the provider’s privileges or who recommended the provider’s discharge from active duty.
       9.31.1.4. Investigation officers or officers in the Peer Review Panel.
       9.31.1.5. Any person whose testimony plays a significant part in the case.
       9.31.1.6. Any officer/member who is participating, or has participated, in other
       administrative proceedings (courts-martial board or administrative review board)
       regarding the provider under review.
       9.31.1.7. Any member who is reviewing, or has reviewed, the provider’s actions under
       consideration by the credentials function.
       9.31.1.8. The Credentials Function Chairperson.
9.32. Legal Advisor. The legal advisor will either be an MLC, judge advocate, or civilian
attorney employed by the AF. The base SJA will appoint the legal advisor, and an attorney to
present evidence on behalf of the MTF.
9.33. Obtaining Court Reporting Services. The MTF is responsible for obtaining court
reporting services for the hearing. Court reporters may be used from the SJA office, if available,
to document the hearing process and results. Obtaining court reporting services through other
means is at the cost of the MTF and not the legal office. Regardless of the source of the court
reporter, the MTF must ensure that the transcript (paper or electronic) is available within 30
calendar days. If a non-DoD court reporter is retained, a business associate agreement is required

Act (Title II) of 1996.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                      165


9.34. Hearing Overview.
   9.34.1. Roles and Responsibilities.
      9.34.1.1. Chairperson. The chairperson of the hearing panel shall preside over the
      proceeding, and must consult with the appointed legal advisor to assure compliance with
      this section before conducting the hearing. The chairperson will rule on challenges
      against the legal advisor. The chairperson, with the help of the legal advisor, will arrange
      for the orderly presentation of evidence. The chairperson, in consultation with the legal
      advisor, will rule on the relevance and admissibility of substantive clinical matters.
      9.34.1.2. Legal Advisor. Will ensure due process and the provider is given adequate
      notice and an opportunity to be heard. Once appointed, the legal advisor may rule on any
      procedural issues that are raised prior to or during the hearing. The legal advisor shall
      administer oaths to the hearing panel and witnesses, and will rule on challenges for cause,
      except those against the legal advisor.
   9.34.2. Hearing Proceedings. These proceedings are not bound by formal rules of evidence
   or a strict procedural format. The chairperson and legal advisor to the hearing panel may use
   the hearing script on the Knowledge Exchange in the adverse action tool kit. The hearing
   panel may question witnesses and examine documents. The results of concurrent or previous
   administrative or legal proceedings shall not be presented at the hearing unless they are
   relevant to the provider’s clinical practice and were part of the allegations being examined by
   the hearing panel. Any witness with knowledge relevant to the specific allegations under
   consideration at the hearing, including but not limited to, the investigating officer and the
   provider’s supervisors, may testify before the hearing panel. At the close of the presentation
   of all of the evidence and closing statements the hearing panel will deliberate and make
   findings as to each allegation outlined in the notification letter and make a recommendation
   to the MTF/CC. The panel’s deliberations are not on the record. The recommendation(s)
   must be one or more of the following (as defined in paragraph 9.27.3.) Reinstatement;
   Reinstatement with M&E; Restriction; Reduction; Revocation; or Denial. The
   recommendation(s) can include comments, rationale, and conclusions to explain the
   recommendation.
   9.34.3. Presentation of New Information at Hearing. Additional information relevant to the
   allegations contained in the notification letter and not used in the original Credentials
   Function Review may be presented at the hearing. However, the provider must be informed
   of the additional information as soon as possible, and must be afforded reasonable time to
   review the information. The provider shall have access to copies of records upon which the
   additional information is based, so that he or she may prepare to refute it. Once the provider
   has reviewed the information, it must be clear on the record that the provider had adequate
   time to review and prepare response. Unfair surprise of new information at the hearing shall
   not be allowed. Note: New information that rises to the level of a new allegation, as
   determined by the legal advisor, requires adherence to the notification provisions.
   9.34.4. Hearing Panel Findings and Recommendation. The hearing panel findings must be
   supported by a preponderance of the evidence. The term ―preponderance of the evidence‖
   simply means the greater weight of credible evidence or that the factual allegation by the
   Medical Group is more likely than not true. There is no requirement to prove any allegation
   beyond a reasonable doubt. Use best judgment, experience, and common sense in resolving
 166                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   disputed and conflicting evidence. Consider the probability or improbability of each piece of
   evidence, and select only that evidence which is most worthy of belief. The hearing panel
   recommendation must be supported by the findings. The recommended action must be made
   by majority vote and in good faith, is required to be based upon prevailing professional
   standards and on the findings and conclusions from the evidence. Allegations shall be
   substantiated through identified incidents or situations. Reference any pertinent section of the
   hearing record/exhibits as needed to support the findings. A findings and recommendations
   worksheet shall be provided to the hearing panel prior to the deliberations (see Kx Adverse
   Action Toolkit). The findings and recommendations worksheet shall be signed by all hearing
   panel members. Any hearing committee member may accomplish a minority report. The
   minority report shall state who made the minority opinion (i.e., peer of the subject), be
   entered into the record, and be included in the hearing transcript.
   9.34.5. Timeliness of Findings and Recommendations. The hearing committee will provide a
   report of their findings on each allegation and their recommendation for action to the
   MTF/CC. This report will be given to the provider within 30 days of the hearing completion.
   9.34.6. Hearing Transcription. A verbatim record of the proceedings is required. In order to
   facilitate transcription, documentation must be made available to the recorder in an orderly
   fashion, with exhibit items listed and numbered as they are presented throughout the hearing.
   The transcript and all exhibits, once accomplished, shall include the following language at
   the bottom of each and every page, ―This is a quality assurance document protected from
   release by Federal Law, Title 10 U.S.C., §1102.‖ One original and three copies of the
   transcript must be prepared (may provide the hearing transcript and exhibits in electronic
   medium). A copy of the exhibits shall accompany each transcript. The transcript must
   include the hearing panel findings and recommendations to the MTF/CC. Note: The original
   transcript and one copy is forwarded to AFMOA/SGHQ. One copy is given to the provider
   and the last copy remains with the MTF.
   9.34.7. Forward Recommendations. The hearing transcript shall be completed and all copies
   provided to the Credentials Function Chairperson within 30 calendar days of the hearing. If
   this cannot be accomplished within 30 calendar days the Credentials Function Chairperson
   shall notify, in writing, the provider and legal counsel of the delay.
       9.34.7.1. The Credentials Function Chairperson gives a copy of all hearing panel
       findings and recommendations, additional recommendations, and the hearing transcript to
       the provider. The provider shall be informed these documents are protected IAW Title 10
       U.S.C., §1102 and can only be released with proper authority.
9.35. Provider Statement of Exceptions and Corrections. After the provider has received the
hearing transcript, including all exhibits, the findings and recommendations worksheet and any
additional recommendations, he or she has 10 calendar days to prepare and submit a written
statement of exceptions and corrections they want to present to the MTF/CC. The provider’s
statement should be forwarded to the MTF/CC through the Credentials Function Chairperson. If
the provider requests additional time to prepare the statement of exceptions and corrections, the
request must be made in writing to the Credentials Function Chairperson before the time limit
has expired. Extensions may be granted (in writing) for good cause.
9.36. Commander’s Decision and Provider Notification. The MTF/CC makes a decision
within 10 calendar days of receiving all documentation (the hearing panel’s findings/
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        167


recommendations, hearing transcript, credential function comments, and the provider’s statement
of exceptions and corrections). The MTF/CC may consult with legal counsel, AFMOA/SGHQ,
and MAJCOM/SG during this process. The MTF/CC is not bound by the findings and
recommendations of the hearing panel. The time may be extended if mission requirements
dictate, but the provider must be notified immediately in writing of this extension.
   9.36.1. The MTF/CC must provide written notification to the provider of the decision
   (reference Attachment 16). This written notification must include the action and the reasons
   for the action. If the MTF/CC’s action is different from the hearing panel’s recommendation,
   an explanation of the rationale for the different action must be given to the provider. If the
   action includes denying, reducing, restricting, or revoking privileges, the provider must also
   be notified of the right to submit a written appeal to the decision to AF/SG through the
   MTF/CC to AFMOA/SGHQ. In addition, the provider must be notified that the action may
   be reportable to regulatory agencies IAW DoD directives. The commander’s decision is
   effective immediately and will require the provider to submit a modification in CCQAS of
   their clinical privileges to reflect the MTF/CC decision.
Provider’s Appeal Following a Hearing
9.37. Provider’s Appeal. The provider may make a written appeal of the MTF/CC’s decision
to the AF/SG. The provider must submit the appeal to the MTF/CC where the action occurred,
within 10 calendar days of receiving notice of the MTF/CC's final decision. The time limit may
be extended by the MTF/CC for good cause. The MTF/CC notifies AFMOA/SGHQ of any
extensions granted and provides a new date when the provider’s appeal can be expected. The
commander will review and may consider the provider’s written appeal. If the MTF Commander
does not grant the appeal, it will be forwarded to the AF/SG following review by the MPRB.
   9.37.1. The MTF/CC may respond and offer rebuttal evidence to any issues raised by the
   provider on appeal. The MTF/CC's decision remains in effect during the appeal process.
   Note: The provider’s right to appeal is to the Surgeon General of the MTF Service.
   9.37.2. Forward Documentation to AFMOA/SGHQ. The MTF will send two copies of all
   documentation related to the action directly to AFMOA/SGHQ, arranged according to the
   template, Arrangement of Adverse Action Case File on the Knowledge Exchange in the Risk
   Management section. A final DD Form 2499, documented the commander’s decision, will be
   completed and placed at Tab 3 within the case file. The MTF will wait until receipt of the
   provider’s appeal, or validate that the provider will not appeal, before sending the case file to
   the AFMOA/SGHQ. The provider’s appeal will be placed at Tab 2 or under separate cover,
   as needed. AFMOA/SGHQ will notify the respective MAJCOM/SG that an adverse action
   has been received and will forward the complete file to AFMOA/SGHQ, Chief, Risk
   Management Operations within 10 calendar days of receipt from the MTF. The MTF will
   use the DD Form 2499, and if necessary a separate cover letter, to forward information on the
   current status of the provider and to identify any associated administrative actions taken. This
   information will be placed at Tab 3 in the case file. The requested information will include:
       9.37.2.1. Specialty Pay status.
       9.37.2.2. Promotions halted.

       9.37.2.8. Removal of AFSC.
       9.37.2.9. Contract Status (if applicable).
9.38. Appeals Review Process. Appellate review is based on sufficiency of due process and
reasonableness of the findings and the MTF/CC’s action. Provider appeals made to the AF/SG
will be reviewed by an AF attorney, who will provide comments on the legal due process and
administrative aspects of the case.
   9.38.1. AFMOA/SGHQ will have a peer review the clinical evidence/substance of the action
   and the appeal.
   9.38.2. If the provider is a member of a different Service, inclusion of a privileged provider
   from the member’s Service on the MPRB should be considered. Prior to final review and
   action, input (review and comments) will be requested from the Surgeon General’s office of
   the provider’s Service. The Service of the provider must respond with their input within 30
   days. To accomplish this, a copy of the file will be sent to the appropriate Surgeon General’s
   office.
   9.38.3. The case is then presented to the MPRB. The MPRB reviews the clinical evidence,
   legal due process of the case, provider’s appeal, and other Service input (if submitted) and
   makes a final action recommendation to AF/SG.
AF/SG Review
9.39. AF/SG Review and Final Action. Chief, Risk Management Operations will prepare the
case for AF/SG review and final action. The AF/SG will make the final decision in the case. The
AF/SG may make an alternate decision and will provide written rationale for the alternate
decision. The AF/SG will direct NPDB reporting IAW DoD directives. AFMOA/SGHQ, (Chief,
Risk Management Operations) will submit the required agency reports (NPDB, FSMB, States of
known licensure, and other professional/regulatory organizations IAW DoD directives).
9.40. AFMOA/SGHQ Notifications. AFMOA/SGHQ, Chief, Risk Management Operations,
will prepare the final documents for the Chief, Clinical Quality Management Division
(AFMOA/SGHQ) to notify the provider, his/her legal counsel if represented, MTF/CC, HQ
MAJCOM/SG and AFMOA/CC. If a report is made to the NPDB, the provider will be notified
by the NPDB and provided a copy of the report.
   9.40.1. The provider will be given written notice of the AF/SG’s final decision. When the
   provider is a member of a different service from the one who took the adverse action, the
   provider’s service Surgeon General’s office will be notified of the final decision.

Section 9C—Adverse Action Documentation and Record Keeping

9.41. Abeyances and Summary Suspensions Documentation.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                       169


   9.41.1. Abeyance Leading to Reinstatement. Notification of abeyance and reinstatement of
   privileges will be kept in the PAF since it is not an adverse action. A summary to include
   reason for abeyance, findings and conclusions, and date of reinstatement will be annotated
   and maintained in the PAF.
   9.41.2. Summary Suspension Leading to Reinstatement. Notification of summary suspension
   and reinstatement of privileges will be kept in the PCF. A summary to include reason for
   suspension, findings and conclusions, and date of reinstatement will be annotated on the AF
   Form 22 and maintained in the electronic PCF.
   9.41.3. Abeyance and Summary Suspension Action Leading to Adverse Action. Action that
   results in restriction, reduction, revocation, or denial of privileges must be placed in the PCF
   along with the final documentation of the reported clinical adverse action. Clinical adverse
   action documentation is maintained by the last MTF where the provider was assigned for a
   minimum of 10 years from the date the provider ends their affiliation with the AFMS and
   then forwarded to AFMOA/SGHQ for archiving. Adverse action documentation is not
   destroyed.
9.42. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Documentation.
   9.42.1. M&E Leading to Reinstatement. If no adverse action is recommended, the M&E
   documents are filed in the PAF. The M&E plan with clear timelines, goals, and objectives
   must be documented. Regular written and verbal feedback must be given to the provider
   during the period of M&E.
   9.42.2. M&E Leading to Adverse Action. If the M&E documents become evidence in an
   adverse action proceeding, these documents become part of the adverse action case file and
   are filed in the PCF. The AF Form 22 may be used to summarize the provider’s performance
   during the M&E period.

Section 9D—Non-Privileged Providers Adverse Practice Actions

9.43. General. When a non-privileged healthcare provider’s conduct, condition, or performance
requires immediate action to protect the safety of patient(s)/staff or the integrity (threat to
discredit or bring unfavorable scrutiny) of the AFMS, the Senior Corps Representative, in
consultation with the squadron and flight commander and the individual’s supervisor, shall
remove the individual from all or a portion of their patient care duties. This action protects
patient(s)/staff safety while a QA investigation into the non-privileged provider’s practice,
conduct, or possible impairment is conducted. The Senior Corps Representative will consult with
the MLC and AFMOA/SGHQ when a QA investigation or adverse practice action is being
considered. The Senior Corps Representative will advise the MTF/CC throughout the adverse
practice action process. Non-privileged providers who are required to be licensed, certified, or
registered by a U.S. jurisdiction are subject to this process. Reports of adverse actions for these
providers will be to state licensing agencies and/or other agencies as appropriate to the specialty
of the provider. These actions are known as adverse practice actions.
   9.43.1. Notification. A healthcare provider may be removed from patient care duties while a
   professional QA investigation is conducted or the MTF/CC is reviewing the matter to make a
   decision whether or not to proceed with an adverse practice action. The non-privileged
   provider is given written notification (see Attachment 18) by the Senior Corps
 170                                                                AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   Representative, that the provider has been removed from clinical practice and the reason for
   the removal (purpose of the QA investigation).
       9.43.1.1. If the provider is removed from only a portion of their patient care duties, the
       letter must state what duties are affected. The notification to the provider must state that
       the findings of the QA investigation will be reviewed by the Credentials Function and
       may be referred to a Peer Review Function.
       9.43.1.2. As part of the notification process, the MTF/CC notifies the contracting officer
       for contract providers or the CPO for a federal civilian employee.
       9.43.1.3. Contract (including host nation contract employees). If an adverse practice
       action is being considered on a contract employee, consult with the assigned Quality
       Assurance personnel assigned to the contract and medical logistics/base contracting
       office when the action is initiated IAW the provisions of the contract.
   9.43.2. Withdrawal of Permission to Engage in Off-Duty Employment. When a non-
   privileged provider is removed from patient care or an adverse action is initiated the guidance
   in paragraph 9.15.2. is also applicable.
QA Investigation Procedures for the Non-Privileged Provider
9.44. QA Investigation. The QA investigation is initiated by the MTF/CC or designee when
needed to investigate any allegations of clinical incompetence, professional misconduct, or
impairment. An investigating officer is appointed in writing (may be appointed by MTF/CC,
Senior Corps Representative, or other appropriate MTF executive leader) and should be a peer
(similar clinical specialty, level of education, and training) of the provider under investigation.
The MTF may consult with AFMOA/SGHQ to seek assistance with the investigating officer
appointment. The purpose and scope of the QA investigation will be explicit in the written
appointment. After completing the QA investigation the investigating officer will submit a
written report to the Credentials Function for review. If the investigating officer is reviewing
clinical competency of the provider, the investigating officer shall be a peer of the subject and
review relevant patient medical records, orientation/training folders, skill verification documents,
professional practice reviews/evaluations, Officer Performance Reports, patient surveys, etc. If
clinical practice deficits were identified while in orientation/training, the investigating officer
shall determine if the provider was put on notice of the clinical practice deficiencies and offered
opportunities to improve. The report will organize the factual findings of the QA investigation,
and include the investigating officer's conclusions and recommendations. The QA investigation
report and other relevant information collected will form the basis of the Credentials Function
review.
9.45. Command Directed Evaluations. The provisions for a CDE as outlined in paragraph
9.18. is also applicable for non-privileged providers.
9.46. The Credentials Function Review (CFR). The CFR will convene and review the QA
investigation findings and make an action recommendation to the MTF Commander. Legal
counsel involvement is recommended. The Credentials Function composition will include at
least one peer of the provider under review. See paragraph 9.23. through 9.24. for CFR
composition. The Credentials Function participants must be fair and impartial. The provider
under review does not have the right to attend this meeting; however, he or she may provide
written comments if desired. Credentials Function recommendations will be forwarded to the
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        171


Senior Corps Representative and MTF/CC within 10 calendar days of the function’s review
completion and may include:
   9.46.1. Reinstatement. Return to clinical duties.
   9.46.2. Reinstatement with M&E. (See paragraph 9.25.2. for definition.)
   9.46.3. Convene a peer review panel.
9.47. Notification to Non-Privileged Provider. The MTF Commander has 10 calendar days
from receipt of the Credentials Function recommendations to make a determination on what
action to take; reinstate, reinstate with M&E, or convene a peer review panel. The MTF/CC is
not bound by the recommendation(s) of the Credentials Function or Senior Corps Representative.
9.48. Adverse Practice Action Notification to AFMOA/SGHQ and AFMOA/SGNP. Once
the MTF/CC makes the decision to pursue an adverse practice action, the MTF will initiate a DD
Form 2499 to document the action. This form and all documents produced for the adverse
practice action are placed in the risk management case file and maintained by the MTF. The
MTF key personnel (e.g., SGN, SGH, RM) will notify and maintain communication with
AFMOA/SGHQ and AFMOA/SGNP of the adverse practice action progress.
Non-Privileged Provider Peer Review Panel
9.49. Peer Review Panel. The Senior Corps Representative is responsible for coordinating the
Non-Privileged Provider Peer Review Panel. The Peer Review Panel will be composed of at least
three clinical peers of the involved provider (similar clinical specialty, level of education and
training). If the MTF does not have three peers available to conduct this review, it may be
accomplished using peers from other MTFs; either in person or via video or teleconferencing.
The provider will receive written notification of the date of the Peer Review Panel and be
provided a copy of the documentation/evidence that will be reviewed by the Panel. The provider
may submit written comments to the Peer Review Panel, but does not have the right to attend this
meeting. The Peer Review Panel is not a legal proceeding. The Peer Review Panel shall convene
within 14 calendar days after receipt of the MTF/CC’s decision, the QA investigation report, and
relevant evidence to make and forward a recommendation to the Credentials Function. The
recommendations may include:
   9.49.1. Reinstatement. Return to clinical duties.
   9.49.2. Reinstatement with M&E. M&E is a well-defined, time-limited, well documented
   plan of Focused Professional Practice Evaluation monitoring to confirm the provider
   possesses the skill, knowledge, and ability to render safe and effective healthcare. The
   documented plan of M&E shall include clear expectations and measures of success that will
   be routinely reviewed throughout the period of M&E. M&E is distinct from supervised
   (restricted) practice since there is no restriction or control placed on the provider’s clinical
   practice. It is a period to monitor the provider’s practice and give feedback. This is neither an
   adverse action nor reportable to regulatory entities.
   9.49.3. Restriction. Restriction is a temporary or permanent limit placed on all or a portion
   of the provider’s clinical practice, so that the provider is required to obtain concurrence
   before providing all or some clinical duties within the scope of his/her certification, license,
   or registration. The restriction requires some form of supervision. Restriction of practice is
   reportable to the appropriate regulatory agencies.
 172                                                                AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   9.49.4. Reduction. Reduction is the permanent removal of a portion of a provider’s clinical
   practice. Reduction of practice is reportable to the appropriate regulatory agencies.
   9.49.5. Revocation. Revocation is the permanent removal of all of the provider’s clinical
   practice and the provider is removed from all patient care duties. Revocation is reportable to
   the appropriate regulatory agencies.
9.50. Credentials Function. The Credentials Function will reconvene within 10 calendar days
to review the Peer Review Panels’ findings and recommendations, and then forward their final
recommendation to the Senior Corps Representative and the MTF/CC. The recommendations are
the same as paragraph 9.49. above. The Senior Corps Representative may make a
recommendation to the MTF/CC under separate cover; however, it is the MTF/CC who will
make the final decision.
9.51. The MTF/CC has 10 calendar days from receipt of the Credentials Function
recommendations to make a determination on what action to take. The MTF/CC is not
bound by the recommendations of the CFR, Provider Peer Panel or those of the Senior Corps
Representative.
   9.51.1. The MTF/CC will give written notification (within 10 calendar days of receipt of
   Credentials Function final recommendation) to the provider of his/her proposed action and
   the basis (allegations) for the proposed action. If the proposed action is to restrict, reduce, or
   revoke, the provider’s clinical practice; then the MTF/CC must advise the provider in writing
   of the right to a hearing and appeal. The letter will include the specific allegations that
   constitute the grounds for the proposed action, include dates and pertinent medical records as
   appropriate. The provider must have access to all information considered by the CFR, the
   Peer Review Panel and the MTF/CC which resulted in the proposed action. Copies of these
   records are releasable to the provider and his/her legal counsel. They are released under
   protection of the Privacy Act of 1974, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
   (Title II) of 1996, and Title 10 USC §1102.
   9.51.2. If the individual is a contract employee, a copy will be sent to the AF contracting
   office responsible for the contract and a letter to contractor. For the federal civilian
   employee, a copy of the letter is sent to the employee relations specialist in the CPO.
Hearing Process for the Non-Privileged Provider
9.52. General. Any non-privileged provider who is removed from all or a portion of patient
care duties may request a hearing. This includes proposed actions to reduce or revoke practice.
The timelines to request a hearing and the management of the adverse practice action and case
file if the non-privileged provider does not submit a request for a hearing, waives their right to a
hearing or fails to appear for a scheduled hearing is the same process as for a privileged provider.
See paragraphs 9.29. through 9.33. for detailed guidance that is applicable to non-privileged
providers. The Senior Corps Representative acts in place of the SGH in the management of non-
privileged providers.
9.53. Hearing Panel Process. The hearing process is the same as described for privileged
providers in paragraph 9.34. For Non-Privileged Providers the Senior Corps Representative
assumes the roles and responsibilities of the Credentials Function Chairperson in this process.
The hearing panel recommendations for non-privileged providers address clinical practice
instead of clinical privileges and may include:
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                      173


   9.53.1. Reinstatement.
   9.53.2. Reinstatement with M&E.
   9.53.3. Restriction.
   9.53.4. Reduction.
9.53.5. Revocatio
9.54. Provider Statement of Exceptions and Corrections. The provisions for non-privileged
providers submitting a statement of exceptions and corrections is the same as those outlined in
paragraph 9.35. for privileged providers. The senior corps representative acts in lieu of the SGH.
9.55. MTF/CC Decision and Provider Notification. The provisions for the MTF/CC decision
and provider notification is the same as for privileged providers as outlined in paragraph 9.36.
9.56. Providers Appeal Following a Hearing. The provisions for the provider’s appeal
following a hearing are the same as for privileged providers as outlined in paragraph 9.37.

decision is the same as for privileged providers as outlined in paragraph 9.39.
9.59. AFMOA/SGHQ Notifications. The provisions for the AFMOA/SGHQ Notification is
the same as for privileged providers as outlined in paragraph 9.40.
9.60. Non-Privileged Provider Documentation Requirements. All adverse action document-
ation (DD Form 2499, Non-Privileged Provider Peer Review Function, and hearing documents,
etc.) on non-privileged staff will be maintained and secured by the MTF risk manager/designee.
The non-privileged provider’s CAF or electronic equivalent will be secured/maintained by the
MTF risk manager/designee during adverse action proceedings. If the non-privileged provider
separates or terminates employment, the adverse action file, along with the individual’s CAF or
electronic equivalent, will be maintained for 10 years at the MTF (similar to the credentials
folder for privileged staff), then forwarded to AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management Operations,
for archiving. AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management Operations, will maintain an adverse action
file in CCQAS with all mandatory data fields complete. If the provider PCSs, all adverse action
documentation will be forwarded by certified mail to the gaining MTF. Note: These documents
will not be handcarried by the provider.
9.61. Removing Nurses from the Nurse Transition Program. Registered nurses who are
removed from the Nurse Transition Program (NTP) for substandard clinical performance or for
unprofessional conduct may be reported to state regulatory agencies. The MTF will complete a
DD Form 2499, along with supportive documentation, and forward this to AFMOA/SGHQ.
AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management Operations will prepare the case for review by SG1 and
AF/SG.
9.62. Removing Unlicensed Technicians from Clinical Practice. Unlicensed Technicians
who hold certifications that are required for the performance of their duties (that are not
otherwise included as a non-privileged provider) shall be afforded due process when removed
from clinical practice due to issues regarding clinical competence, misconduct or impairment.
Due process shall include a QA investigation (if necessary) and peer review, as outlined below,
 174                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


of the clinical substance and circumstances surrounding the reason for removal. A peer review
will be conducted and the technician notified of the peer review results no later than 30 calendar
days from the date the technician was suspended from practice. The technician will have an
opportunity to provide a written rebuttal to the peer findings. Rebuttal must be submitted no later
than 15 calendar days following notification of peer review results. Once the MTF/CC takes
final action, the technician may appeal the decision to AFMOA/SGHQ within 10 calendar days
of the final decision. Note: Certified technicians may include, but not limited to: CADAC,
Registered Respiratory therapists, Mammography technicians, Histopathology and Optometry.
   9.62.1. Peer review will be by technicians of similar grade and experience, and hold the
   same certification as the one in question. At least two peers must be used in the review.
   9.62.2. There is no clinical due process requirement for unlicensed technicians who do not
   require a certification to perform their clinical duties.
   9.62.3. Decertification procedures for Independent Duty Medical Technicians are found in
   AFI 41-103.

Section 9E—Management of Impaired Privileged/Non-Privileged Providers

9.63. General. Any medical or mental condition that prevents or that significantly reduces an
individual’s ability to safely execute his or her responsibilities in providing health care may be
considered an impairment. This includes alcohol or drug/substance impairment, or mental health
disorder not responsive to treatment or provider refuses treatment. The Credentials Function or
Senior Corps Representative will review individuals who may be impaired and determine if their
health status adversely affects their clinical practice and patient safety.
9.64. Alcohol or Drug Impairment.
   9.64.1. Voluntary Self-disclosure. A provider may self-disclose an alcohol or drug
   impairment and request treatment. The treatment may require hospitalization or travel away
   from the MTF. Voluntary removal from patient care duties while seeking treatment is not an
   adverse privilege/practice action under these circumstances, and is not reported as an adverse
   action to any regulatory agency. However, the removal related to the impairment may be
   required to be reported to regulatory agencies (e.g., State Medical Board). Any associated
   administrative/UCMJ action that results from alcohol or drug impairments may also be
   reported to regulatory agencies. Self-disclosure after notification that a QA investigation is
   being conducted does not meet the intent of voluntary self-disclosure as described in this
   paragraph. IAW DoD 6025.13-R, the AF/ SG shall report clinical adverse actions taken
   against providers with alcohol and/or chemical-related impairments who do not self-refer
   into a rehabilitation program, or those who self-refer, but do not complete the rehabilitation
   program or have evidence of relapse following completion of the program.
   9.64.2. Determining If Adverse Action Is Needed. The MTF will consult with their MLC to
   review the facts of the case. The MLC will provide guidance to the MTF on adverse actions
   related to impairments. The base SJA advises on possible criminal violations related to
   impairments and will be consulted prior to questioning the provider.
   9.64.3. The MTF/CC will direct a QA investigation into reports of provider impairment.
   Abeyance or summary suspension should be considered. The QA investigation may consider
   all information, which evaluates the impact of the impairment on the provider’s ability to
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                       175


  deliver safe healthcare. This may include Command-directed mental health evaluation, blood
  alcohol levels, police reports, a statement from the immediate supervisor addressing any
  performance problems, or information from substance abuse counselors on the nature and
  extent of the problem and proposed treatment plan, etc. If the QA investigation determines
  that the impairment does not affect clinical practice and the ability to deliver safe healthcare,
  the Credentials Function Chairperson or Senior Corps Representative will forward the
  recommendation to the MTF/CC. The MTF/CC makes the final decision.
  9.64.4. Any alcohol or drug event that occurs while a provider is on duty or on call must be
  considered for adverse privilege/practice action since it raises a significant patient safety
  concern. The adverse privilege/practice action process for impaired providers is as prescribed
  by this instruction.
  9.64.5. Returning to Practice Following Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Aftercare.
  Clinical personnel who have undergone treatment for a substance use disorder must
  demonstrate a period of clinical stability without relapse before returning to clinical duties.
     9.64.5.1. Aftercare Program. Following treatment, it is mandatory that providers
     participate in an aftercare program as part of a recovery/relapse prevention plan. The
     provider must be actively engaged in a post-treatment aftercare program during this post-
     treatment period.
         9.64.5.1.1. Substance Dependence. A minimum period of six months stability
         following completion of treatment is mandatory for personnel recovering with a
         diagnosis of substance dependence before returning to clinical duties. During the six
         month time period, the provider will be participating in an aftercare program. It may
         be recommended that the provider continue to attend an aftercare program after the
         six month time period based on the medical needs of the provider. The required six
         months of stability begins after the completion of the treatment program.
         9.64.5.1.2. Substance Abuse. A minimum period of three months stability following
         completion of treatment is mandatory for personnel recovering with a diagnosis of
         substance abuse before returning to clinical duties. During the three month time
         period, the provider will be participating in an aftercare program. It may be
         recommended that the provider continue to attend an aftercare program after the three
         month time period based on the medical needs of the provider. The required three
         months of stability begins after the completion of the treatment program.
     9.64.5.2. Following successful completion of the recovery/relapse prevention plan
     (treatment and aftercare), the provider’s case will be presented to the Credentials
     Function for reevaluation with potential partial or complete restoration of clinical
     privileges at that time.
         9.64.5.2.1. As part of the information presented to the Credentials Function for
         review, input from the ADAPT program manager must be obtained as to the
         individual’s diagnosis, prognosis, and implications for clinical performance. This
         includes information regarding the individual’s medical stability, readiness to return
         to clinical duties, and risk of relapse.
         9.64.5.2.2. Consultation with the MTF ADAPT Program Manager or the AFMOA
         ADAPT/ DDR Branch staff is strongly recommended.
 176                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


          9.64.5.2.3. The Credentials Function or Senior Corps Representative in consultation
          with the SQ/CC and individual’s clinical supervisor shall also define a period of
          monitoring and evaluation, with regular feedback sessions documented.
   9.64.6. Evidence of Relapse. Any identified relapse will be reported immediately to the
   Credentials Function Chairperson and/or Senior Corps Representative. The individual will be
   removed from patient care duties while a full reassessment is accomplished.
   Recommendations regarding the status and management of the provider will be made by the
   Credentials Function Chairperson or Senior Corps Representative and forwarded to the
   MTF/CC. If an adverse action is proposed, due process procedures as prescribed by this
   instruction will apply. Impairment relapse is reportable to the NPDB and other regulatory
   agencies.
   9.64.7. Actions Involving Civilian Personnel. The supervisor of Federal civil service
   providers/ employees will contact the CPO, Employee Relations Branch, for advice prior to
   questioning the employee.
   9.64.8. Actions Involving Contract Providers. The supervisor of contract staff will contact
   the QA personnel assigned to the contract and the base contracting officer to ensure that the
   contractor’s employer is informed about the conduct or performance of a contract employee.
   9.64.9. Severing the employment relationship in lieu of taking the adverse
   privileging/practice action that is indicated by evidence of impairment is not in compliance
   with this instruction.
9.65. Physical/Mental Impairments.
   9.65.1. Temporary Impairments. Temporary impairments (i.e., broken arm or leg,
   pregnancy, scratched cornea, medication use which impacts lucid thought) will be noted on
   an official duty limiting condition report by the primary/treating healthcare provider. It will
   include an explanation regarding the prognosis and how the medical impairment/condition
   limits or affects the provider’s clinical practice. (For example: can’t operate with a broken
   finger, should not deliver babies with a broken arm or temporary nerve damage or loss of
   strength, etc.) The duty limiting condition report should also specify, to a reasonable degree
   of medical certainty, the length of time the duty limiting condition report is expected to be in
   effect. This duty limiting condition report should immediately be brought to the attention of
   the individual’s supervisor and the Credentials Function Chairperson and/or Senior Corps
   Representative. A copy should be placed in the PAF for privileged providers or comparable
   record for non-privileged providers. While a provider is on a duty limiting condition report,
   restriction on the provider’s practice consistent with the duty limiting condition report is not
   an adverse action and is not reported to regulatory agencies.
   9.65.2. Permanent and Long-Term Impairments. Permanent or long-term impairments (as
   documented by the healthcare professionals treating the provider) shall be reviewed by the
   Credentials Function for privileged providers with consideration towards permanent
   reduction/restriction/revocation of privileges. For non-privileged providers, the Senior Corps
   Representative, in conjunction with the flight commander and individual’s supervisor, will
   review long-term impairments to consider permanent practice action. These reviews will
   result in a written recommendation to the MTF/CC who will decide if an adverse action is
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                       177


  warranted. If a provider voluntarily requests a restriction/reduction/revocation of their
  clinical privileges/ practice, an adverse action is not required.
  9.65.3. Voluntarily Restricting Practice Related to a Medical Condition. A provider may
  voluntarily restrict/reduce/revoke their clinical privileges/practice when a medical condition
  interferes with ability to perform the full scope of duties. A written request to
  restrict/reduce/revoke clinical privileges/ practice must be made (before an abeyance or any
  other adverse action process has been initiated) to the Credentials Function or to the Senior
  Corps Representative. This voluntary action is not an adverse privileging/practice action and
  is not reported as an adverse action to any state regulatory agency. The Credentials
  Function/Senior Corps Representative must approve the voluntary action and forward their
  recommendation for approval to the MTF/CC. Following MTF/CC concurrence, the clinical
  privileges/practice will be changed, as appropriate. AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management
  Operations, may be required to report the medical condition to the individual’s state licensing
  board. The MTF will complete the template letter, located at Attachment 22 and forward this
  information to AFMOA/SGHQ. AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management Operations will then
  report the voluntary restriction (not an adverse action) as directed.
  9.65.4. Determining if Adverse Action is Warranted. The Credentials Function or Senior
  Corps Representative in consultation with the SQ/CC, the individual’s supervisor and the
  MLC may conduct a QA investigation into reports of physical/mental impairment. (This is
  not necessary if a provider self-discloses as stated above.) Abeyance or summary suspension
  should be considered. The purpose of the QA investigation is to determine the extent of the
  possible impairment/medical problem and whether the impairment or condition affects the
  provider’s ability to deliver safe patient care.
     9.65.4.1. The review process may consider how the impairment or condition was
     discovered or disclosed, a statement concerning the current clinical performance from at
     least one clinical or administrative supervisor, and a statement of diagnosis, prognosis,
     and implications for clinical performance from the primary physician treating the
     provider. Additional medical evaluations may be directed as needed.
     9.65.4.2. If the QA investigation determines that the provider’s condition does not affect
     clinical practice, the Credentials Function Chairperson or Senior Corps Representative
     will forward this recommendation to the MTF/CC.
     9.65.4.3. The MTF/CC makes the final decision. If the provider is removed (not
     voluntarily) from all or a portion of their patient care responsibilities because the medical
     condition affects his or her ability to render safe patient care, then the provider is offered
     full due process procedures as directed in this instruction.
  9.65.5. Medical Evaluation Board/Physical Evaluation Board (MEB/PEB). The MEB/PEB
  process is not designed to decide if a provider is capable of providing safe healthcare--it is a
  process to decide whether the provider is fit for military duty. Some medical conditions can
  produce a significant level of disability that markedly interferes with functional ability. These
  conditions may require a provider to voluntarily restrict/reduce/revoke one’s practice or be
  subject to a possible restriction/reduction/revocation in privileges/practice. Action to curtail
  the privileges/practice of a medically impaired provider must be taken when appropriate.
 178                                                              AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   9.65.6. Reassessment of Impairment Status. Impairment status and rehabilitation should be
   reviewed at least monthly, with input from the treating healthcare professional. The
   Credentials Function/Senior Corps Representative will assess each situation, on a case-by-
   case basis, to determine if a formal action against privileges/practice is warranted. In cases
   initially deemed temporary impairments, evaluations should address possible reclassification
   of the impairment as permanent or long-term, if initially projected recovery times are
   surpassed. Worsening of a condition shall be monitored and documented. Reevaluation and
   updating the duty limiting condition report may be indicated. Reevaluation of the provider’s
   clinical privileges/practice is also indicated.
9.66. Management of Individuals with Communicable Diseases that Could Affect Patient
Safety.
   9.66.1. Determining Extent of the Exposure Risk. The Credentials Function or Senior Corps
   Representative (for non-privileged providers) must review the scope of practice of the
   provider and consult with infectious disease or preventive medicine specialists to determine
   the risk of transmission for the assigned AFSC of the individual. The Credentials Function or
   Senior Corps Representative will identify any specific exposure prone procedures (EPP)
   within the scope of practice for the provider (based on the provider’s AFSC) and make a
   recommendation to the MTF/CC whether any restriction on the provider’s clinical practice is
   warranted.
   9.66.2. Voluntary Restriction of Practice. A provider may voluntarily restrict/reduce/revoke
   one’s practice related to medical condition/communicable disease. A written request to
   restrict/reduce/revoke clinical privileges/practice must be made to the Credentials Function
   or to the Senior Corps Representative. This voluntary action is not an adverse action and is
   not reported as an adverse action to any state regulatory agency. The Credentials Function or
   Senior Corps Representative must approve the voluntary action and forward the
   recommendation for approval to the MTF/CC. Following MTF/CC concurrence, the clinical
   privileges/practice will be changed, as appropriate.
   9.66.3. Restriction of Practice. If the MTF/CC determines that the individual’s clinical
   practice must be restricted, reduced, or revoked due to concerns about the transmission of the
   disease while delivering healthcare, the removal of the provider from patient care duties is
   not an adverse privilege action. In addition, this removal is not reported as an adverse action
   to the NPDB or to regulatory agencies. However, the medical condition may be reported to a
   state licensing agency as outlined in paragraph 9.65.3.

Section 9F—Other Management Issues Related to Adverse Actions

9.67. Simultaneous Adverse Action and UCMJ Action. For some types of misconduct,
criminal investigative actions may coincide with an adverse privileging/practice action. Although
such actions can proceed simultaneously, a request may be made to have one action proceed over
another (i.e., UCMJ action prior to adverse action). The adverse action will proceed no later than
action by the courts-martial convening authority (clinical adverse action should not be deferred
pending administrative appeal). Individuals serving on a panel for the UCMJ action will not be
appointed to a Peer Review Panel or to the hearing process for the adverse action.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        179


   9.67.1. When Office of Special Investigations (OSI) is investigating a healthcare
   professional for an issue which is also the basis for an adverse privileging/practice action, the
   adverse privileging/practice action should be placed on hold while the OSI completes their
   investigation. The MTF will notify the provider in writing that the adverse
   privileging/practice action process is ―on hold‖ until the OSI investigation is complete and
   the MTF/CC receives the findings of the OSI investigation. Note: Typically the provider’s
   privileges are placed in summary suspension, or removed from clinical practice for the non-
   privileged provider during the OSI investigation. The provider is given written notice of
   such. The OSI may be given certified copies of relevant records. The MTF must have a
   receipt of all records that are given to the OSI. The OSI is obligated to return all records and
   any other medical evidence the MTF provides. MTF personnel must not interfere with the
   OSI investigation.
   9.67.2. If there is a conflict between the MTF and other investigating agencies regarding the
   continuation of an adverse action process, the base SJA will decide whether the adverse
   action will be postponed.
   9.67.3. When the basis of an adverse action is a criminal conviction the provider is not
   permitted to challenge the finding of guilt.
9.68. Administrative Denial of Privileges. The Credentials Function may recommend a denial
of initial privileges or denial of a renewal of clinical privileges when providers do not meet the
established requirements of the accrediting entities, AFMS, or the MTF. This includes providers
who have not met AF continuing education requirements, or providers who cannot provide
objective data to demonstrate current clinical competence. It also includes denial based on lack
of facility support for the requested privileges. These denials are not adverse privileging actions
and do not require the facility to offer due process procedures.
9.69. Removing Residents from Patient Care Responsibilities. In situations where a resident
is removed from a residency training program for substandard clinical practice or professional
misconduct that may impact patient care, the resident may be reported to the Federation of State
Medical Boards, after due process is afforded. AFI 41-117 governs the due process procedures
for residents. All professional actions involving residents being permanently removed from
patient care and/or removed from their residency program must be forwarded to
AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management Operations, for immediate reporting to the FSMB. HQ
AFPC/DPAM must forward the adverse action file, with all supporting documentation
demonstrating due process (i.e., faculty board minutes, hearing, appeal, etc.). AFMOA/SGHQ,
Risk Management Operations, is the releasing authority for information related to the FSMB
report. The involved resident may appeal only the report language to AFMOA/SGHQ. The
resident may appeal the action leading to the report to HQ AFPC/DPAM. The residency director
may be required (by State Medical Boards and other regulatory entities) to report adverse actions
taken on medical residents. In such cases, the residency director will notify AFMOA/SGHQ,
Chief, Clinical Quality Management Division, before submitting such reports. AFMOA/SGHQ
and SGJ will review and approve prior to any reports submitted.

Section 9G—Reporting and Releasing Adverse Information to National and Regulatory
Agencies
 180                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


9.70. Responding to Written Requests for Information. MTFs should reply directly to
civilian medical facilities, credentialing agencies, or other official medical entities on requests
for information on a provider’s current practice/privilege information. All requests for
information on medical malpractice claim history or adverse privilege/practice actions (clinical
and administrative-HIPDB) shall be referred to AFMOA/SGHQ, Chief, Risk Management
Operations. AFMOA/SGHQ is the releasing authority for such information.
9.71. Reporting Misconduct. Reports may be made, by AFMOA/SGHQ, to State
Licensing/Certification Boards where a member holds license or certification to practice if the
provision of the state(s) either mandate or allow proactive reporting, specified under state
licensing policy, for individual or organization reporting of allegations of misconduct where
there is reasonable cause (such as an arrest) that could have a serious impact on patient/staff
welfare or safety. Such required reports will be forwarded to AFMOA/SGHQ for reporting.
9.72. Disposition of Reports and Actions When MTFs Close. Closing MTFs shall forward all
archived and pending adverse action cases to AFMOA/SGHQ. Risk Management Operations
assumes responsibility for managing these cases.
9.73. AFMOA/SGHQ Responsibilities in Reportable Actions. AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk
Management Operations is responsible for reporting to regulatory agencies outside of the AF and
releasing information related to medical malpractice claims history, clinical adverse actions,
NPDB, and HIPDB reports.
9.74. NPDB Reporting of Adverse Actions. Only AFMOA/SGHQ makes reports to external
regulatory agencies, unless directed to make such reports by AF/SG or a designee.
   9.74.1. Privileged providers will be reported to the NPDB within 30 calendar days of the
   AF/SG final decision when:
       9.74.1.1. Clinical privileges have been denied, restricted, reduced, or revoked for
       substandard performance, impairment, or unprofessional conduct.
       9.74.1.2. A provider voluntarily surrenders clinical privileges while under investigation
       for issues of clinical incompetence or misconduct, or in return for not conducting such an
       investigation or proceedings.
       9.74.1.3. Provider separates, retires, moves PCS, or terminates employment, contract, or
       volunteer services with their privileges summarily suspended.
   9.74.2. A copy of the NPDB report will be sent to states of known licensure, the FSMB for
   physicians, and/or the American Association of Dental Examiners (AADE) for dentists, and
   other regulatory/professional organizations IAW DoD directives.
   9.74.3. The following agencies will receive a notification of the final adverse action: HQ
   MAJCOM/SG, MTF/CC, to the subject of the action at his or her last known address and as
   appropriate HQ AFPC/DPAM, ANG/SG, HQ AFRC/SG, and HQ ARPC/SG.

Section 9H—Administrative Adverse Actions

9.75. Reporting to the HIPDB. This instruction serves as policy for implementing the HIPDB
reporting requirement IAW the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and DoD
6025.13-R. The HIPDB is a national healthcare fraud and abuse data collection program for
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                       181


reporting and disclosing adverse administrative actions against personnel involved in the
delivery of medical services. By direction of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of
Defense/Health Affairs (ASD/HA), all personnel assigned to the AFMS, including active duty,
reserve, Air National Guard, civil service, and personal service contract personnel, are subject to
reporting to this data bank. The AF/SG has the authority to report those employed by the AFMS.
Non-personal services contractors are not employees of the AFMS. If the non-personal services
contractor commits an offense that meets the requirement for reporting to the HIPDB, the
MTF/CC will submit the appropriate documentation to the contracting employer. It is the
responsibility of the contractor to report the action to the HIPDB.
9.76. Roles/Responsibilities:
   9.76.1. The AF/SG is responsible for reports regarding reportable administrative adverse
   actions taken against healthcare providers, suppliers, or practitioners providing healthcare
   services to active duty members or any other MHS beneficiaries in MTFs or as a part of any
   military unit. AF/SG has delegated broad oversight of this program to AFMOA/SGHQ, but
   the AF/SG makes the final decision to report to the HIPDB.
   9.76.2. AFMOA/SGHQ provides oversight and consultation for HIPDB reporting. Risk
   Management Operations processes these actions for review and reporting and notifies, in
   writing the MTF/CC, MAJCOM/SG, and the individual of the final action.
   9.76.3. AFMOA/SGHQ is responsible for reviewing cases for substantive matters,
   completion of required process, and forwarding to AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management
   Operations.
   9.76.4. When the MTF/CC receives reports on administrative actions to determine whether
   the action should be forwarded for reporting to the HIPDB, it is imperative that the effect the
   action has on the provision of healthcare be clearly and completely ascertained and
   documented. The MTF risk manager (or Commander directed designee) shall be responsible
   to oversee processing of administrative actions considered for HIPDB reporting by the
   MTF/CC. Once the MTF process is completed, the entire package will be forwarded for
   reporting as indicated in this instruction.
   9.76.5. SQ/CC, First Sergeants, and supervisors of medical personnel are responsible for
   identifying, and reporting to the MTF/CC, actions that may potentially be reported to the
   HIPDB (Article 15, Courts-Martial, etc.).
   9.76.6. Contractor Quality Assessment Personnel will serve as the liaison between the MTF
   and the contractor, and will monitor the process to ensure the requirements outlined in the
   contract are fulfilled. Any contract Termination for Default will be reviewed and considered
   for reporting to the HIPDB.
   9.76.7. For actions involving Federal civilians, the MTF Civilian Personnel Liaison is
   responsible for working with the CPO to ensure that local bargaining obligations have been
   met.
   9.76.8. The MLC and SJA are responsible for providing legal consultation to the MTF.
   9.76.9. The Credentials Function Chairperson will report those cases that meet criteria for
   HIPDB reporting to the MTF/CC for privileged providers. The SGH is responsible for the
   preliminary determination of clinical applicability (how the member’s action affects the
 182                                                              AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   provision of healthcare) and providing guidance to the risk manager for the process to make a
   reporting recommendation to the MTF/CC. The risk manager will ensure necessary
   documentation is contained in the HIPDB file: SGH notification letter, MTF/CC notification
   letter(s), DD Form 2499, final administrative action report(s), supporting documentation/
   evidence, and provider statement (if submitted).
   9.76.10. The Senior Corps Representative will report those cases that meet criteria for
   HIPDB reporting to the MTF/CC for actions involving non-privileged providers. This
   individual is responsible for the initial preliminary determination of clinical applicability
   (how the member’s action affects the provision of healthcare) and providing guidance to the
   risk manager for the process to make a reporting recommendation to the MTF/CC on and
   completing paperwork necessary for reporting for non-privileged providers.
   9.76.11. The First Sergeant and Medical Group Superintendent will report those cases that
   meet criteria for HIPDB reporting involving enlisted members to the MTF/CC. The Medical
   Group Superintendent is responsible for the initial determination of clinical applicability
   (how the member’s action affects or could affect the provision of healthcare) and providing
   guidance to the risk manager for the process to make a reporting recommendation to the
   MTF/CC on enlisted members.
9.77. Reportable Actions:
   9.77.1. Military Personnel: Reportable actions are courts-martial convictions, once approved
   by the courts-martial convening authority, and non-judicial punishment imposed under
   Article 15 of the UCMJ, provided the convicted/punished member is a healthcare provider,
   supplier, or practitioner. These acts or omissions for which the member was convicted or
   punished must be related to the delivery of a healthcare item or service that could have
   affected the provision of healthcare. These include, but are not limited to, fraud, drug or
   alcohol-related incidents, assault, homicide, sexual misconduct, and theft. Reportable actions
   also include any administrative action resulting in separation, reduction in grade, involuntary
   military occupational specialty reclassification or other administrative action when such
   action is related to the delivery of a healthcare item or service. The MTF/CC will determine
   further reportable actions individually as they relate to the provision of healthcare.
   9.77.2. Federal Civilian Personnel: Reportable actions include adverse personnel actions
   related to misconduct, based on acts or omissions negatively impacting the delivery of a
   healthcare. These include, but are not limited to, fraud, drug or alcohol-related incidents,
   assault, homicide, sexual misconduct, and theft. Adverse disciplinary actions include
   suspension of more than 14 calendar days, removal from Federal employment, and change to
   lower grade based on disciplinary procedures. Actions such as furlough without pay and
   reduction in grade or removal based on performance are not reportable, unless related to the
   delivery of a healthcare.
   9.77.3. Contract Personnel: Reportable actions include contract termination for default taken
   by an MTF or medical command against a personal services or non-personal services
   contractor.
9.78. Procedures:
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                             183


   9.78.1. Upon imposition of an adverse administrative action, the SQ/CC must notify the
   individual in writing within 10 calendar days that the action may be reportable to the HIPDB
   (see sample at Attachment 23).
   9.78.2. The individual involved has 10 calendar days to submit a reply stating why he/she
   feels the action should not be reported. If the tenth day falls on a weekend or holiday, the
   response is due the individual’s next scheduled duty day. If no response is received within 10
   calendar days, the process will continue.
   9.78.3. The SQ/CC (or designee) will make a preliminary determination as to whether the
   act or omission did or could have a potential to adversely effect the provision of healthcare.
   The risk manager or designee will complete a DD Form 2499 indicating in Section 12 the
   effect the action does or could have on the provision of healthcare. Forward the paperwork to
   the MTF/CC within 10 calendar days of receipt.
   9.78.4. The MTF/CC will make the final determination as to the effect on healthcare and
   whether the individual shall be considered for reporting to the HIPDB. He/she must notify
   the individual in question in writing within 10 calendar days as to the final decision (see
   sample letter at Attachment 23).
   9.78.5. Forward two copies of the case file to AFMOA/SGHQ. Case files must contain:
       9.78.5.1. SQ/CC notification letter and Commander’s final letter to recommend reporting
       to the HIPDB and how the member’s action affected or could have affected on the
       provision of healthcare.
       9.78.5.2. For military members, AF Form 3070, Record of Non-Judicial Punishment, or
       copy of courts-martial order announcing the convening authority’s initial action; for
       Federal civilian employees, a copy of the decision letter and Standard Form 50, Notice of
       Personnel Action, affecting the action.
       9.78.5.3. DD Form 2499.
       9.78.5.4. Member’s written statement (if submitted). A memorandum for record, or other
       documentation, if the member declined to submit a statement.
       9.78.5.5. Initial letter of notification to individual of potential to report to the HIPDB.
9.79. AFMOA/SGHQ Review. AFMOA/SGHQ will review the case file for completeness and
forward the original to AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management Operations, for processing to the
AF/SG, and reporting to the HIPDB.
9.80. Maintenance of HIPDB Case File at MTF. A copy of the HIPDB case file shall be
maintained by the MTF for a minimum of ten years. When/if a provider PCSs, the file is
forwarded to the gaining MTF. Adverse action files should be filed with a case number
(example: MTF name/10-001). After ten years the file is forwarded to AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk
Management Operations, for archiving. Note: The provider is not allowed to have possession of
the file, but may be provided a copy of the file.
9.81. Courts-Martial or Federal Civilian Adverse Action Appeal. If the case involves a
Courts-Martial or Federal civilian adverse action, and the individual intends to appeal, the
HIPDB reporting process must continue, regardless of the status of the appellate process. A
report may be made regardless of the appeal status. If the decision is overturned or modified on
 184                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


appeal, and the individual had been reported to the HIPDB, an amended report will be made. An
amended report will also be made in the event a non-judicial punishment action against a
military member is subsequently set aside. MTF/CC should submit amended reports or requests
to rescind reported actions that have been overturned according to the same procedures as
outlined in this section for initial reporting.
9.82. Queries. When the NPDB is queried, a HIPDB report is given automatically. Queries are
required for privileged providers when making privileging recommendations. See paragraph
5.21. which outlines a one-time query requirement for new RNs, LVNs and LPNs. An initial
query could be completed on other non-privileged providers.

Section 9I—AF Clinical Code of Conduct

9.83. AF Clinical Code of Conduct. To ensure optimum patient care, the health care
organization must promote a safe, cooperative, and professional environment. Staff, patients, and
visitors must be treated with courtesy, respect, and dignity. It is expected that all AFMS
personnel will adhere to and be accountable to this AF Clinical Code of Conduct by holding
themselves and other members to these conduct standards. The AFMS has ―zero tolerance‖ of
intimidating and disruptive behaviors.
   9.83.1. To support the AF Clinical Code of Conduct each MTF will:
       9.83.1.1. Have an organizational process to identify and report AF Clinical Code of
       Conduct violations, such as intimidating and disruptive behaviors.
       9.83.1.2. Utilize prevention strategies, including skills-based training and coaching.
       9.83.1.3. Staff assistance procedures.
       9.83.1.4. Corrective and disciplinary action plans, including documentation of all
       attempts to address intimidating and disruptive behaviors.
       9.83.1.5. Healthcare staff education plan.
   9.83.2. Appropriate Behavior to support AF Clinical Code of Conduct includes, but is not
   limited to:
       9.83.2.1. Constructive criticism communicated in a professional, meaningful, and
       reasonable manner, offered in good faith with the aim of informing, educating, and
       improving patient care and safety. This communication should not include blame and
       invoke shame
       9.83.2.2. Clear communication techniques
       9.83.2.3. Teamwork; cooperative approaches to communicate, resolve problems, and
       express concerns
       9.83.2.4. Expression of dissatisfaction with organizational policies/practices through
       appropriate forums and/or chain of command for the betterment of healthcare delivery
   9.83.3. Disruptive and intimidating behavior will not be tolerated in the AFMS. Disruptive
   behaviors include, but are not limited to:
       9.83.3.1. Verbal outburst, name calling, and physical threats or threats of retribution.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                     185


     9.83.3.2. Sexual harassment.
     9.83.3.3. Throwing of items in the work environment.
     9.83.3.4. Refusing to perform assigned tasks.
     9.83.3.5. Uncooperative attitudes during routine healthcare activities.
     9.83.3.6. Reluctance or blatant refusal to answer questions or staff requests, return calls
     or pages.
     9.83.3.7. Condescending language or voice intonation.
     9.83.3.8. Berating or belittling statements.
     9.83.3.9. Use of profanity or disrespectful language.
     9.83.3.10. Degrading or demeaning comments regarding patients, family members, staff,
     or the AFMS.
  9.83.4. Surveillance. Staff will report any violations of the Code of Conduct through their
  chain of command, risk manager, patient safety manager, or other designee.
     9.83.4.1. Complaints alleging disruptive or intimidating behavior shall be made in
     writing, signed by the individual submitting the complaint and/or witness and submitted
     to supervisor, risk manager, or patient safety officer. The written report should contain
     the following information (see Kx AA toolkit for a template) and be maintained in a
     designated file such as the PAF, CAF, CFETP, etc.
         9.83.4.1.1. Date, time, and location of the disruptive behavior.
         9.83.4.1.2. Name of the person committing the disruptive behavior.
         9.83.4.1.3. A factual description of the disruptive behavior and circumstances

         time, place and names of those intervening.
  9.83.5. Interventions when disruptive behavior is identified:
     9.83.5.1. Addressing disruptive behavior should be non-adversarial and focus on
     resolution of the discord, establishing accountability for the disruptive behavior, behavior
     modification strategies, and protection of safe patient care.
     9.83.5.2. Apology statement.
     9.83.5.3. Tiered approach to corrective action if appropriate; such as warning, LOC,
     LOR.
186                                                             AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


      9.83.5.4. If disruptive behavior is egregious and/or affects the safety and well-being of
      patients and/or staff, the member committing the disruptive behavior may be removed
      from duties and afforded due process IAW this instruction, the adverse actions process.
      9.83.5.5. Any criminal behavior shall be immediately reported to the MTF leadership
      and local legal authorities.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        187


                                           Chapter 10

                           HEALTHCARE RISK MANAGEMENT

Section 10A—Risk Management Program

10.1. Healthcare Risk Management. A series of ongoing, interrelated activities designed to
identify, assess, manage, and monitor events and risks associated with the healthcare
organization. Healthcare RMs must collaborate and coordinate these activities with patient
safety, performance improvement, quality management, and other relevant functional managers
throughout the organization. The goal of risk management is, after events and risks have been
identified and assessed, that the organization can develop prioritized risk reduction strategies and
performance improvement activities to provide safe, high-quality patient care. In addition there is
information on appropriate disclosure, patient communication, and handling of QA information
and documentation.
10.2. Risk Management Program. Each MTF shall have a risk management program, which
focuses on identification, mitigation, and prevention of harmful patient and staff events through a
process of risk reduction strategies. Risk management processes encompass activities to reduce
risk to the patient(s) and family, government, healthcare personnel, and visitors.
   10.2.1. Medical involvement and oversight of the risk management program must be
   structured, including processes to identify and analyze adverse patient events.
   10.2.2. The medical staff will review variations from established standards of care/practice,
   implement corrective actions to reduce risk, and provide educational processes to improve
   care. This is accomplished either in a formal Risk Management Committee or within the
   ECOMS. Similarly the effectiveness of the MTF risk management program will be reviewed
   by the organization’s committee responsible for quality assurance activities.
   10.2.3. The healthcare risk management process includes 5 steps: 1) identify and analyze
   risk/ loss exposure, 2) consider alternative risk reduction techniques, 3) select optimal risk
   management technique or combination of techniques, 4) implement the selected risk
   management technique and 5) monitor/evaluate risk reduction technique response and
   process improvement outcomes.
10.3. Healthcare Risk Manager (RM).
   10.3.1. The RM shall have competence in clinical risk management standards and policy,
   general healthcare risk management administration, competence with patient safety program
   and initiatives, basic knowledge of clinical disease processes, medical terminology, risk
   prevention and performance improvement processes. Competence must be evidenced by
   appropriate education or by at least one year of practical experience in clinical healthcare risk
   management.
   10.3.2. The SGH shall support the RM with event identification and analysis (including
   PCEs, SEs, etc.), Medical Incident Investigations (MIIs), medical malpractice claim
   management, quality of care reviews with SOC determinations, adverse actions, and other
   risk management activities.
 188                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


Section 10B—Disclosure, Patient Communication, and Handling of Quality Assurance
Information and Documentation

10.4. Disclosure and Patient Communication and Immediate Actions Following an
Unexpected Occurrence Causing Unanticipated Outcomes. Primary providers responsible
for the patient shall disclose adverse event outcomes to patients and when appropriate, to their
family members. Current research and professional literature demonstrate that appropriate
disclosure of adverse outcomes may thwart rather than encourage medical malpractice action by
patients. Disclosure, like an effective informed consent process, is an effective mode of patient
communication.
   10.4.1. Research further suggests patients’ desire: 1) truthful disclosure of what happened
   and why (objective statement of the known facts), 2) a sincere apology and 3) commitment
   by the facility (system) to investigate the event to prevent recurrence. Proper disclosure does
   not suggest the provider(s) have committed medical negligence, but rather informs the
   patient/family that an unanticipated outcome has occurred, shares known facts to include the
   patient’s current status, ongoing treatment and follow-up plan.
   10.4.2. Staff may be concerned about the protection of 10 USC §1102 (quality assurance)
   materials. This concern should not prevent proper disclosure. Since disclosure is done as
   soon as possible following awareness of the adverse or unanticipated outcome the
   information provided in the disclosure discussion is not the result of a medical quality
   assurance investigation or process.
   10.4.3. The intent of disclosure in this instruction is that the patient and patient’s family (if
   appropriate) will receive cogent, factual event information without blame or fault attributed
   to someone. Disclosure must be understandable for the patient and family and avoid medical
   jargon that may confuse the patient and family. Disclosure shall be timely, acknowledge the
   adverse event when it is apparent and communicate when sufficient facts are available. If a
   language barrier exists between the provider and the patient and/or family, the MTF shall
   arrange for an interpreter.
   10.4.4. Proper full disclosure shall address:
       10.4.4.1. The immediate needs of the patient to minimize injury. The event shall be
       reported IAW this AFI (i.e., SE reporting if applicable, PCE, etc.).
       10.4.4.2. Staff shall seek (time and circumstance permitting) advice, if needed or as
       appropriate, of the SGH, Chief Nurse, PSM, RM, and the base SJA or regional MLC
       prior to discussing the unanticipated outcome with the patient/family. The responsible
       provider shall have another healthcare team member attend the disclosure conference
       with the patient/family. The disclosure discussion should be directed by the primary
       responsible provider.
       10.4.4.3. Disclosure communication shall be done in a location to afford privacy to the
       patient and family and eliminate interruptions (cell phones, pagers, etc.).
       10.4.4.4. Recognize cultural, religious, and language factors of the patient and family;
       plan for accommodations if necessary, i.e., interpreters, sign language, etc.
       10.4.4.5. Full disclosure communication includes: (1) the clinical facts known at that
       time, (2) empathy and education for the patient/family, (3) addressing the patient/family’s
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                       189


       anger and concern, (4) confirmation the patient/family understand the facts, (5) timely
       and adequate documentation of the disclosure in the medical record, and (6) state the next
       steps; follow-up instructions and resources to contact.
10.5. Medical Quality Assurance Program and Materials: United States Code, Title 10,
Section 1102. As defined by the statute; ―medical quality assurance program‖ means any activity
carried out before, on, or after November 14, 1986 by or for the Department of Defense (DoD) to
assess the quality of medical care, including activities conducted by individuals, military medical
or dental treatment facility committees, or other review bodies responsible for quality assurance,
credentials, infection control, patient care assessment (including treatment procedures, blood,
drugs, and therapeutics), medical records, health resources management review and
identification and prevention of medical or dental incidents and risks.
   10.5.1. ―Medical quality assurance record‖ means the proceedings, records, minutes, and
   reports that emanate from quality assurance program activities described above and are
   produced or compiled by the DoD (which includes the AFMS) as part of a medical quality
   assurance program. Examples include but are not limited to: risk management work products,
   patient safety work products, credentialing/privileging documents, peer review documents,
   and medical incident investigations.
   10.5.2. Medical quality assurance records created by the AFMS as part of a medical quality
   assurance program are confidential and privileged. Such records may not be disclosed to any
   person or entity, except for the following exemptions allowed under this statute:
       10.5.2.1. To a Federal executive agency or private organization, if such medical quality
       assurance record or testimony is needed by such agency or organization to perform
       licensing or accreditation functions related to DoD healthcare facilities or to perform
       monitoring, required by law, of DoD healthcare facilities.
       10.5.2.2. To an administrative or judicial proceeding commenced by a present or former
       Department of Defense healthcare provider concerning the termination, suspension, or
       limitation of clinical privileges of such healthcare provider.
       10.5.2.3. To a governmental board or agency or to a professional healthcare society or
       organization, if such medical quality assurance record or testimony is needed by such
       board, agency, society, or organization to perform licensing, credentialing, or the
       monitoring of professional standards with respect to any healthcare provider who is or
       was a member or an employee of the DoD.
       10.5.2.4. To a hospital, medical center, or other institution that provides healthcare
       services, if such medical quality assurance record or testimony is needed by such
       institution to assess the professional qualifications of any healthcare provider who is or
       was a member or employee of the DoD and who has applied for or been granted authority
       or employment to provide healthcare services in or on behalf of such institution.
       10.5.2.5. To an officer, employee, or contractor of the DoD who has a need for such
       record or testimony to perform official duties.
       10.5.2.6. To a criminal or civil law enforcement agency or instrumentality charged under
       applicable law with the protection of the public health or safety, if a qualified
 190                                                             AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


       representative of such agency or instrumentality makes a written request that such record
       or testimony be provided for a purpose authorized by law.
       10.5.2.7. In an administrative or judicial proceeding commenced by a criminal or civil
       law enforcement agency, but only with respect to the subject of such proceeding.
   10.5.3. When medical quality assurance documents are appropriately released IAW 10
   U.S.C. §1102 the documents must be labeled as such and protected under cover which states
   the medical quality assurance protection continues to the recipient. Documents that are not
   produced for the purpose of medical quality assurance should not be labeled citing this
   statue.
       10.5.3.1. Label may read as such: ―This is a quality assurance document protected from
       release pursuant to 10 U.S.C. §1102. Do not release without proper authority‖.
   10.5.4. Sharing medical quality assurance data. The release authority for medical quality
   assurance data/material (except for release to appropriate exemptions noted above) is Office
   of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Health Affairs (OSD/HA). The request (see the toolkit
   on the Kx clinical quality website for an example) must be completed and submitted to
   OSD/HA Chief Medical Officer through AFMOA/SGHQ.
       10.5.4.1. Aggregate statistical medical quality assurance data are expressed in the form
       of a number, including whole numbers, fractions or percentages. Numerical data that is
       derived from records within the DoD medical quality assurance program must also be in
       such demographic groupings that the release of the information would not lead to the
       identification of the patient or the provider involved in providing care. The data must be
       de-identified.
       10.5.4.2. Office of Management and Business (OMB) required each federal agency to
       determine the lowest number for a grouping (―threshold rule‖) which must exist before
       data can be released.
       10.5.4.3. The ―threshold rule‖ as defined by OMB and as it pertains to the release of
       information from the MHS is three (3). This means that if the grouping for the aggregated
       data includes several types of demographic, such as age, sex, race, active duty status,
       rank or service the population or number of persons meeting all of the demographics in
       the grouping must be greater than 3.
   10.5.5. Exemption from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Medical quality assurance
   records may not be made available to any person under the FOIA. However, IAW FOIA
   regulation, DoD 5400-7/Air Force Supplement (current edition), medical quality assurance
   documents responsive to the request must be provided to the FOIA office after legal review
   and attached to the denial letter.
   10.5.6. Penalty. Any person who willfully discloses a medical quality assurance record,
   knowing that such record is a medical quality assurance record, shall be fined not more than
   $3,000 in the case of a first offense and not more than $20,000 in the case of a subsequent
   offense.

Section 10C—Risk Management Program Implementation
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                      191


10.6. Notifications. All serious adverse events are considered a potentially compensable event
(PCE) and will be captured in the PCE module within CCQAS. They will be promptly
investigated by the risk manager and other appropriate staff as necessary (Patient Safety Officer,
Infection Control Officer, PI, etc.).
   10.6.1. Any adverse event involving significant morbidity or death shall be immediately
   reported through the facility chain of command to AFMOA/SGHQ and HQ MAJCOM/SG.
   AFMOA/CC will notify HQ USAF/SG as appropriate.
   10.6.2. Immediate action shall be taken to ensure the patient is protected from additional
   injury and to mitigate the untoward effects of the event. The patient will be informed of the
   effects of the adverse event and the prognosis. See Section 10B for guidance on disclosure
   and release of quality assurance information.
   10.6.3. When an adverse event occurs, the person in charge of the clinical area where the
   event occurred shall ensure chain of command notification within 24 hours, including head of
   the service (nurse supervisor, flight commander), SGH, SGN and SQ/CC.
   10.6.4. If death or life-threatening injury has occurred the commander shall also be notified.
   10.6.5. This event notification is forwarded to the risk manager no later than the next duty
   day.
   10.6.6. Adverse event notification shall contain the facts of the event and avoid conjecture
   about the cause of the event.
   10.6.7. The risk manager will ensure the patient safety officer is informed of all events and
   collaborate on event analysis, risk reduction, and process improvement activities.

Section 10D—Risk/Event Identification

10.7. Identification. The RM will develop processes to identify potential and real events/risks
within their organization. There are many formal and informal methods to identify the spectrum
of system issues and patient and staff events/risks; some of which are requirements within the
patient safety program (e.g., near miss, event identification, FMEA, RCA). Refer to chapter 2,
paragraphs 2.6. through 2.8. for more information. Healthcare RMs and PSMs will implement
and coordinate adverse event identification and assessment processes. The risk management and
patient safety event analysis processes are distinct and generate different products. Risk
management products include (but are not limited to): event reports, PCEs, MIIs, quality of care
reviews with SOC determination, identification of significantly involved providers (SIPs),
lessons learned, and other performance improvement/risk reduction strategies.
   10.7.1. A SIP is one who actively delivered care (based on clinical record entries) in either
   primary or consultative roles during the episodes of care that gave rise to the allegation,
   regardless of SOC determination. Additional defining characteristics include providers who
   had the authority to start, stop or alter a course of treatment; who had the authority to
   recommend to start, stop, or alter a course of treatment; or who had the responsibility to
   implement a plan of evaluation or treatment. Authority to recommend means input was
   solicited and legitimate (i.e., the individual making the recommendation was acknowledged
   to have special expertise or other specific standing in the clinical issues). This term is not
   meant to include the providers who had only peripheral, yet appropriate, patient interaction,
192                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


  nor those providers whose patient involvement was not reasonably related to the specific
  allegations of sub-standard care and injury. SIP is not dependent upon standard of care.
  10.7.2. Event/Incident Reporting. The reporting process requires the person most
  knowledgeable of the event to record information related to what, when, where, how, and any
  known contributing factors leading to the event. Only event facts shall be recorded; personal
  opinion or conjecture shall be avoided. The AF Form 765, Medical Treatment Facility
  Incident Statement, or other tool may be used to capture event reporting. All events are also
  reported to the PSM. The following Do’s and Don’ts apply to event/incident reporting:
      10.7.2.1. Do notify the RM and PSM by next duty day of becoming aware of an adverse
      event. The risk manager will notify the chain of command of serious adverse events and
      events of a notorious nature immediately. (This includes all sentinel events, never events,
      and unanticipated deaths).
      10.7.2.2. Do report at minimum the patient demographic information, facility related
      information (admission date, admitting diagnosis, unit, etc.) and factual description of the
      event and extent of injury.
      10.7.2.3. Do route event identification form to patient safety manager (if not already
      informed).
      10.7.2.4. Do maintain the confidentiality of the event identification form and stamp with
      the Quality Assurance protection statement, which protects this information from public
      disclosure under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. §1102.
      10.7.2.5. Don’t indicate in the patient’s medical record that an event identification form
      was completed, do not allow the event identification form to become part of the medical
      record. (Do record a factual account of the patient’s condition in the medical record.)
      10.7.2.6. Don’t assign blame or admit liability on the event identification form or in the
      medical record.
      10.7.2.7. Don’t delay event identification and assessment process.
      10.7.2.8. Don’t make copies of the event identification form.
  10.7.3. Occurrence Screening. Another method to identify adverse events or process
  deviations is occurrence screening. This method uses clearly defined lists of clinical
  occurrences or processes with which patient medical records are screened. The screeners
  review the medical record against the predefined clinical or administrative criteria (event,
  clinical practice guideline, or process) and identify if an event occurred or there was a
  process deviation which could have resulted in risk to the patient.
      10.7.3.1. Criteria for the screens are established by the facility and based upon high-risk,
      problem-prone, or low-volume clinical areas. Examples may include:
         10.7.3.1.1. The operating/surgical suite may develop criteria to screen for proper
         informed consent process and documentation,
         10.7.3.1.2. The ambulatory surgical unit may develop criteria to screen records for
         proper discharge instructions and follow-up and
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                       193


          10.7.3.1.3. The emergency room may use occurrence screening to review all patients
          who re-visit the emergency room within 72 hours, missing or inadequate discharge
          instructions or failure to give patients ordered prescriptions.
       10.7.3.2. Administrative occurrence screening is also beneficial to identify process
       deviations that may impact the delivery of healthcare. For example, screening for
       inadequate or missing medication reconciliation, wait times, medical record availability
       or staffing patterns.
       10.7.3.3. Benefits of the occurrence screening process are that the screen may identify
       missed events or process deviations which may have or could affect patient care.
       10.7.3.4. Occurrences are shared with patient safety and performance improvement for
       system-wide process improvement. The data collected via the occurrence screening
       should be aggregated and shared with patient safety, quality management, and
       performance improvement.
   10.7.4. Patient and Staff Surveys. Patient surveys (satisfaction and complaints) can offer
   valuable information and it is unique since it is from the patient’s perspective. Early
   identification of patient dissatisfaction offers the risk manager and facility leadership the
   opportunity to review the incident of care and attempt to reduce the patient’s dissatisfaction.
   It is well established that medical malpractice litigation often is a result from patient
   dissatisfaction and anger.
       10.7.4.1. Staff surveys may be obtained by informal and formal methods. Since the
       healthcare team is the ―sharp‖ end of the healthcare delivery system, it is critical to have
       their input regarding the risks within our system. The healthcare team is affected by the
       ―blunt end‖ of the care system including the policies, procedures, regulations, and
       resources. The team’s input and feedback must be collected, analyzed, and integrated into
       the risk management and performance improvement processes. This will facilitate staff
       involvement and result in more effective system improvement.

Section 10E—Risk Assessment

10.8. Risk Assessment. After gathering data and information regarding system processes and
events it is essential to assess or analyze the risk and determine where best to focus
activities/changes for improvement. Risk assessment occurs at all levels of patient care. The
organization shall institute mechanisms to determine what level of assessment is required; this
will be accomplished using the AHRQ Event Classification taxonomy (see Kx Clinical Quality
website). This is done in collaboration with the PSM. Risk management review and analysis of
identified risks and/or events is separate from the patient safety processes. The process tools
from each respective program will be separate; however, the aggregated data, corrective action
plans and performance improvement activities will be done collaboratively.
   10.8.1. Occurrence Screening: As mentioned above, occurrence screening is a risk/event
   identification and assessment tool that may be used on an ongoing basis. It is well suited to
   identify near misses, actual events and process deviations. Data collected from occurrence
   screens may be used for peer review activities and are also helpful to monitor clinical
   practice across both professional and para-professional disciplines.

  10.8.2. PCEs. A PCE is an adverse event that resulted in temporary or permanent harm to
  the patient and presents a possible financial loss (disability payment, malpractice claim
  payment or death benefit payment) to the Federal Government.
      10.8.2.1. All PCEs will be identified and classified using the AHRQ Common Formats
      for event classification. The MTF RM will ensure the PSM is notified of the PCE. (The
      PSM will review the event and determine the level of analysis for the event, e.g., RCA.)
      Events meeting the following AHRQ categories will be identified as a PCE: Death,
      Severe Permanent Harm, Permanent Harm, Temporary Harm, Additional Treatment, and
      Emotional Distress/ Inconvenience. The AHRQ Common Formats tool is posted at
      https://kx.afms.mil/ .
      10.8.2.2. Utilize the following criteria to determine if patient harm has occurred in the
      event:
         10.8.2.2.1. May have contributed to or resulted in temporary harm to the patient and
         required intervention,
         10.8.2.2.2. May have contributed to or resulted in temporary harm to the patient and
         required initial or prolonged hospitalization,
         10.8.2.2.3. May have contributed to or resulted in permanent patient harm,
         10.8.2.2.4. Required intervention necessary to sustain life,
         10.8.2.2.5. May have contributed to or resulted in the patient’s death,
         10.8.2.2.6. Was an unexpected adverse patient outcome of a member of the armed
         forces that suggests a potential disability separation or retirement of the member as a
         result of the outcome, or
         10.8.2.2.7. Was an episode of care in which the patient/family communicated angst
         or raised serious concern about the episode of care.
      10.8.2.3. All sentinel events (SEs) (as defined by TJC), adverse events (as defined by
      AAAHC), never events, unanticipated deaths, and medically-related active duty deaths or
      disability separations associated with the failure of a healthcare provider to meet the SOC
      will be considered a PCE and all applicable review activities will apply.
      10.8.2.5. PCEs will be investigated by the Risk Management Office and includes the
      following activities:
         10.8.2.5.1. All evidence relevant to the event will be sequestered and maintained by
         the risk management office, including but not limited to, medical records and
         telephone consults, radiology reports/exams/films/recordings, fetal monitor strips,
         ancillary recordings from medical monitoring devices such as anesthesia, cardiac
         monitors, etc. Note: It is critical to sequester medical equipment and recordings
         immediately following the event. The risk manager and SGH will ensure this process
         is briefed to all staff annually. (See paragraph 10.8.5. on products liability).
         10.8.2.5.2. SGH will ensure appropriate disclosure (see paragraph 10.4.4.) and
         continuity of care is arranged for the patient.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                     195


        10.8.2.5.3. Formal QOC review with SOC determination(s) (see Kx RM toolkit for a
        suggested template) shall be completed by an individual designated by the SGH and
        be initiated within 30 days of the event. The QOC review summarizes the event of
        care and contains several subcomponents including: event facts, chronological
        summary of care, identification of SIPs, determination of the SOC for each SIP, list
        of references/literature used to establish the SOC, identification of system issues that
        may have contributed to the event, and proposed recommendations for performance
        improvement and risk reduction activities as appropriate. The QOC review supports
        the MTF risk reduction and performance improvement activities and provides the
        necessary information should litigation result. The MTF RM will coordinate risk
        reduction and performance improvement activities with the PSM and other quality
        personnel as appropriate. PCE review procedures are completed within 180 days from
        event notification.
        10.8.2.5.4. The RM will enter the PCE into CCQAS PCE module immediately
        following the event identification. The event will be entered using the following
        taxonomy: Base name-PCE- Yr-number. Example: Bolling-PCE-10-01. All data
        fields shall be completed within the CCQAS PCE module for each PCE.
        Additionally, the RM will create a file to maintain the paper documents produced for
        the PCE process since the CCQAS PCE module does not support scanning and
        uploading paper documents. A certified copy (paper and/or electronic) of the medical
        records and ancillary reports (X-rays, etc.) will be maintained as part of the PCE file.
        The PCE file is maintained for 10 years and the CCQAS PCE is a permanent record
        and is not deleted from the system.
        10.8.2.5.5. SIPs should be encouraged to submit a memorandum for record following
        the event. This facilitates capturing the facts soon after the event. The memorandums
        are protected IAW Title 10 U.S.C., §1102 and maintained within the risk
        management PCE file.
        10.8.2.5.6. All SIPs (privileged and non-privileged) will have a quality of care
        (QOC) review with SOC determination completed. The SOC reviews will be
        arranged by the risk manager and SGH and Senior Corps Representative as required.
        SOC reviews are completed by peers internal or external to the MTF. The event of
        care is measured using current standards and the review must articulate how the care
        met or did not meet the current standards. In some circumstances SOC may be
        indeterminate due to lack of information such as missing records or lost evidence.
           10.8.2.5.6.1. QOC reviews will include at a minimum: summary of the event,
           provider(s) involvement, provider(s) status, i.e., attending, resident, etc., relevant
           date/times, care measured against current standards, and system issues that
           contributed to the event. References used in the review should be cited.
           10.8.2.5.6.2. A notification letter and a copy of the SOC determination (reviewer
           name redacted) is given to the provider to inform them of their involvement in the
           PCE, their SOC determination, and the PCE process. The SGH and/or other
           applicable clinical leadership will present the QOC review including SOC
           determination with the SIP as an opportunity to provide feedback and mentoring,
           and to discuss the PCE process.
196                                                            AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


         10.8.2.5.7. Any documents produced by the MTF for the PCE file are protected by
         10 U.S.C. §1102 and shall be marked accordingly.
  10.8.3. SEs are unexpected occurrences involving death or serious physical or psychological
  injury or risk there of (TJC definition). The AAAHC uses the term ―adverse incident‖ and
  defines it as an adverse incident, that at a minimum includes: 1) an unexpected occurrence
  during a healthcare encounter involving psychological injury or illness, including loss of
  limb or function, not related to the natural course of the patient’s illness or underlying
  condition, 2) any process variation for which a recurrence carries a significant chance of a
  serious adverse outcome, 3) events such as breaches resulting in a negative impact on a
  patient, even where death or loss of limb or function does not occur.
      10.8.3.1. The RM will identify and analyze SEs IAW the PCE procedures; identify SIPs,
      obtain and secure provider memorandums (if provided), QOC reviews including SOC
      determinations and contributing system issues, and corrective action plan/performance
      improvement activities.
      10.8.3.2. The QOC reviews will be given to the appropriate leadership (SGH, SGN,
      SGD, clinical Dept Chiefs, etc.) to be used for feedback and mentoring opportunity with
      SIPs.
  10.8.4. Medical Incident Investigation (MII). (AFRC/SGP Review for Reserve MII.) The
  primary purpose of a MII is to find out how the system contributed to the adverse outcome
  by thoroughly investigating the facts in a non-punitive way. The ultimate goal is to learn
  from the event and improve healthcare by recommending system changes to reduce the risk
  of recurrence, thereby decreasing harm to patients.
      10.8.4.1. The MII will provide a comprehensive, unbiased review of an event by a
      clinical team external to the MTF. The MII process is focused upon prevention, not
      punishment, and on improving healthcare processes to prevent recurrence of events.
      10.8.4.2. The MII process may be completed in addition to an RCA. The MII and RCA
      may occur concurrently and there is no mandate to complete one before the other. In
      addition, if both an RCA and MII are performed on an event, the RCA and MII teams
      shall not share the findings and recommendations between the teams until both processes
      are complete. This ensures neither team is biased by the others investigation and
      conclusions. MIIs are protected from disclosure under 10 U.S.C. §1102 and the Privacy
      Act of 1974. The MII will not be released to external organizations without permission
      from the HQ USAF/SG office. Clinical lessons learned are extrapolated from the MII and
      RCA reports and then may be shared with MTF staff for educational and performance
      improvement purposes. The MII and RCA reports are not releasable to the MTF staff, the
      patient, or the patient’s family.
      10.8.4.3. The MII will be conducted IAW with this instruction and using the MII toolkit
      on the Kx at https://kx.afms.mil/clinicalquality.
      10.8.4.4. The Unit/Wing Commander may order a Command Directed Investigation
      (CDI) that may be accomplished in parallel with an MII. The purpose of the CDI shall be
      explained to MTF personnel involved (interviewed). The CDI is not conducted for
      medical quality assurance purposes; therefore, it is not 10 U.S.C. §1102 protected. The
      CC will assign an investigating officer to conduct the CDI and the report will be
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                   197


     submitted to the requesting CC. The CDI and MII process and products will remain
     separate and apart at all times.
     10.8.4.5. Major Incidents Suggesting an MII. AFMOA/CC initiates an MII after
     coordination with the MTF/CC and HQ MAJCOM/SG. The MTF/CC, Inspector General,
     or the chain of command for the MTF/CC may request AFMOA/CC initiate an MII. The
     MII will begin within 30 calendar days of the incident. The following incidents may
     warrant initiation of an MII (list is not all-inclusive):
        10.8.4.5.1. Inpatient suicides or active duty member suicides when the member was
        receiving care in Mental Health Clinic (ADAPT, Family Advocacy Program and/or
        mental health clinic) or other healthcare setting when under care for related
        illness/treatment.
        10.8.4.5.2. Sentinel events as defined by TJC; adverse events as defined by AAAHC;
        and ―Never events‖ as described by the National Quality Forum.
        10.8.4.5.3. Those incidents where a full objective evaluation cannot be accomplished
        internally at the organization or base level.
        10.8.4.5.4. Incidents with media attention or of a notorious nature, and incidents with
        high-level interests (i.e., IG complaint).
        10.8.4.5.5. Any other event or series of events which either caused, or could cause,
        injury or death to a person who, in the opinion of the MTF/CC, AFMOA/CC or HQ
        MAJCOM/SG, will benefit the patient and organization from a formal investigation.
        10.8.4.5.6. Those incidents where the findings of such an investigation are likely to
        be applicable throughout a MAJCOM or on an AFMS-wide basis.
     10.8.4.6. Selection of Medical Incident Investigators. AFMOA/CC will select the MII
     team members and sends the MII team member appointment letters. The following
     criteria are used to select the medical incident investigator:
        10.8.4.6.1. Is not on staff at the MTF where the incident occurred.
        10.8.4.6.2. Does not have a personal interest in the investigation, or with the staff

         10.8.4.7.8.12. Identifies implications for the AFMS and suggest policy/procedure
         changes, clinical lessons learned, and NOTAMs.
         10.8.4.7.8.13. Possible Criminal Behavior. Notifies MTF/CC if criminal behavior
         is potentially identified during the investigation process. Note: If during an
         interview information is provided which gives the investigator reason to suspect
         the interviewee or someone else they are referring to may have committed a
         criminal offense, STOP the interview and contact the MTF/CC.
      10.8.4.7.9. Medical Incident Investigators:
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                   201


           10.8.4.7.9.1. If concerned about the quality of care delivered (acts and
           omissions), refer their concern to the SGH, who will ensure an appropriate review
           of the care is conducted.
           10.8.4.7.9.2. Complete a credible, thorough and unbiased investigation.
           10.8.4.7.9.3. Complete a preliminary MII report before departure from the MTF.
           10.8.4.7.9.4. Assist the MII Team Chief to prepare a brief to the MTF/CC with
           the findings and conclusions of their investigation.
           10.8.4.7.9.5. Return all evidence (e.g., medical records, x-rays, equipment) to the
           MTF/CC (or designated individual) for safeguarding. EXCEPTION: In certain
           cases, especially those involving suspected criminal activity, the applicable law
           enforcement agency or SJA may maintain some, or all, of the evidence.
        10.8.4.7.10. MII Process. Several factors influence the scope of the investigation,
        including the severity of the injury and the possibility of recurrence. The MII process
        is best accomplished in a systematic manner determining the sequence of events,
        contributing or causal factors, and recommending methods to remove or mitigate the
        contributing factors to prevent recurrence of the incident. The MII process includes
        the following steps:
           10.8.4.7.10.1. Determine the sequence of events; through a review of the medical
           records and any witness statements; map out the flow of what happened, and
           when they happened based on their initial understanding of the events. Flow
           charts can immediately assist the team to decide what additional information is
           needed and later will assist the team in developing recommendations for PI.
           Complete initial flow chart of the event with details discovered after review of
           physical evidence and completion of witness interviews.
           10.8.4.7.10.2. Compile physical evidence for review (medical records, laboratory
           studies, x-rays, EKGs, policies, procedures, emails, etc.).
           10.8.4.7.10.3. Conduct witness interviews. Include those involved in the incident,
           those who saw or heard it, and those who’s training and experience qualify them
           as experts. Witnesses may include: all involved staff, MTF leadership, patient,
           patient’s family members (with their permission), significant others, or friends,
           co-workers, patient’s military chain of command, civilian providers, etc. Note:
           Family, significant others, friends and co-workers may be appropriate witnesses
           in certain incidents, especially with suicide incidents.
               10.8.4.7.10.3.1. It is important to note that the documents/results from the
               MII are not releasable to the patient and family since the investigation is a
               medical quality assurance document protected IAW 10 U.S.C. §1102.
               10.8.4.7.10.3.2. It is not recommended to record witness interviews. If done,
               the witness must be informed and consent to the recording. Investigators
               should annotate relevant facts provided by the witnesses and summarize the
               interviews in the MII report.
               10.8.4.7.10.3.3. Witnesses are not required to testify under oath and are not
               sworn in. Before performing the interview, the witnesses must be advised on
202                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


                 the purpose of the investigation and the limited confidentiality of their
                 statements. The interview documents are part of the MII report and are
                 protected quality assurance documents IAW 10 U.S.C. §1102.
                 10.8.4.7.10.3.4. MII team identifies any contributing factors, including
                 human factors (see tools in MII toolkit on knowledge exchange) which may
                 have culminated in the event.
                 10.8.4.7.10.3.5. Analyze      each     contributing     factor to propose
                 recommendations to prevent recurrence of the event. MII report must be
                 consistent with the findings and not contradict itself.
                 10.8.4.7.10.3.6. Summarize facts,   findings, contributing factors,
                 recommendations, and corrective action plan in the MII report and
                 PowerPoint brief.
             10.8.4.7.10.4. Human Factors Analysis. There are many potential human factors
             that need to be assessed during a MII. In addition to the MII toolkit, the DoD
             Human Factors Guide (reference, DoDI 6055.7, Accident Investigation,
             Reporting, and Record Keeping) provides information for those who investigate,
             report, and analyze medical mishaps. This methodology and the tools will be
             utilized when conducting an MII. Human factors should be considered and
             addressed in the investigation.
  10.8.5. Medical Devices and Products Liability.
      10.8.5.1. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) of 1997,
      amended by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. §321 requires
      manufacturers track certain devices when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      orders them to do so. Tracking is intended to facilitate notification and recall in the event
      a device presents a serious risk to health that requires prompt attention. Each MTF must
      comply with medical device tracking and reporting IAW these regulations and establish
      current guidance to demonstrate compliance.
         10.8.5.1.1. The FDA has issued orders to manufacturers to track implantable devices
         and devices used outside a facility and publishes this information in Title 21 Code of
         Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 821. Tracking records must be maintained for the
         useful life of the device, even if a patient is lost to follow up. Tracking is no longer
         required when documentation show that the device is returned, destroyed, explanted,
         or the patient dies. MTF process must support these tracking requirements
         (documentation must be maintained to meet regulation requirements).
         10.8.5.1.1. 2. Medical Logistics will track life sustaining or life supporting supplies
         used within and outside the medical facility. Standard Form 380, Reporting and
         Processing Medical Materiel Complains/Quality Improvement Report, is used for
         complaints involving medical supplies.
             10.8.5.1.1.3. Biomedical Equipment coordinates investigation of medical devices
             (equipment) with the SGH, MTF RM, PSM, and Medical Logistics. Uses FDA
             forms and ECRI Computerized Product Reporting system (CPRS) to report
             medical device information.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                          203


               10.8.5.1.1.4. MTF will have a forum to provide oversight of the medical device
               and implant tracking and reporting process, e.g., Facilities and Environment
               Function.
       10.8.5.2. Risk Management Processes: A product liability case can arise from injuries
       caused by defective medical appliances, equipment, organ transplants, prosthetic devices,
       surgical implants, surgical equipment, hospital supplies, diagnostic equipment and
       hearing and visual aids. Any of these products can be the subject of a products liability
       lawsuit if they cause injury to a patient.
       10.8.5.3. The SGH or designee will ensure the investigation and documentation of
       whether the involved medical devices were used in full compliance of the manufacturers’
       requirements. It may be necessary to utilize a clinical expert who understands the medical
       condition the device was intended to improve and the role of the device. In addition to
       statutory tracking and reporting requirements noted above, this review will be
       documented in the MTF quality of care review and maintained in the PCE file.
       10.8.5.4. In any actual or potential medical device/products liability case, the RM will
       ensure all evidence (e.g., any medical device, needles, pumps, supplies, drugs, vials) are
       immediately sequestered and preserved following the event. All equipment and/or
       medical appliances shall be removed from the clinical area, marked that it is out of
       service, and preserved for testing by biomedical engineering and the manufacturer. The
       relevant maintenance documents, purchase orders, and manufacturer’s literature shall
       also be secured for review.
       10.8.5.5. When surgical area medical devices and equipment are involved in a medical
       event (ambulatory surgery, inpatient operating room, etc.) the equipment shall be
       immediately removed from service and inspected by a qualified government employee
       (biomedical engineer) to determine whether there was a malfunction or a design flaw, and
       to decide whether an independent appraisal is necessary. The MTF RM will coordinate
       with Biomedical Equipment and Logistics. The supplier and manufacturer shall be
       notified and provided an opportunity to inspect (while supervised by a qualified
       government employee) the equipment and the actual parts involved. The SJA/legal
       counsel shall be notified prior to any inspection by government employees, contractor, or
       supplier employees. The equipment shall not be returned to service prior to inspection.
       Any parts replaced in the equipment involved shall be secured by the chief of the logistic
       division for possible evidentiary use. All original maintenance and purchase records shall
       be secured and photographs taken of the equipment and actual parts involved.

Section 10F—Risk Control and Risk Reduction Strategies

10.9. Risk Control and Risk Reduction. Risk identification is the foundation for safe and
effective healthcare. But once the risk is identified, action is necessary to reduce or eliminate that
risk. Many existing activities within the delivery of healthcare serve to either reduce or eliminate
risk. These include, but are not limited to: policy/procedure review and revision, staff
education/training/orientation, team training, patient/family education and biomedical equipment
maintenance.
   10.9.1. Elements of risk control include but are not limited to:
204                                                                 AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


      10.9.1.1. Competency Assessment. See chapter 8 for additional guidance on competency
      assessment. The MTF must ensure healthcare personnel are clinically current and
      competent. This is accomplished with an active, ongoing review of clinical performance.
      10.9.1.2. Education and Training Activities. The organization shall have a facility and
      unit orientation program for all staff members, including educating staff on risk
      identification (e.g., near miss events, potential unsafe medical devices, adverse events),
      risk assessment (e.g., participation in event analysis, quality of care reviews), and risk
      control principles and practices.
         10.9.1.2.1. Ongoing staff education/in-services should include: equipment training,
         mock drills (especially emergency-type procedures, high risk/low volume
         procedures), simulation training.
      10.9.1.3. Efforts to improve healthcare team communication; formal team training and
      patient handover protocols, grand rounds, and patient care conferences.
      10.9.1.4. Standardization; developing standard work processes, protocols, and equipment
      (using the same type of medical device (e.g., IV pump) within an MTF.
      10.9.1.5. Checklists (surgery site verification checklist, central line care).
      10.9.1.6. Simplification (simplify key work processes, use of flowcharts).
      10.9.1.7. Avoid or reduce reliance on memory (procedure algorithms).
      10.9.1.8. Forcing functions or constraint functions to avoid error (tubing connections,
      alarms).
      10.9.1.9. Separating ―look alike‖ and ―sound alike‖ medications.
      10.9.1.10. Use of evidence-based protocols or current clinical guidelines
      10.9.1.11. Adequate medical record keeping; documentation must be legible, timely,
      accurate, and complete, including but not limited to patient complaint/concern, patient
      assessment, diagnosis, treatment plan, test results, follow-up strategies, and patient
      education.
      10.9.1.12. Adequate supervision protocols and staff is educated on the protocols.
      10.9.1.13. Adequate informed consent process.
      10.9.1.14. Focusing care; appropriate resourcing where care is needed most; including
      appropriate number and type of staff (staff mix to support more junior staff, especially in
      high-risk clinical areas).
  10.9.2. SG NOTAMs and Clinical Quality ―Lessons Learned‖. A NOTAM will be released
  to the AFMS by AFMOA/SGHQ as a means of identifying clinical concerns and sharing
  lessons learned from malpractice claims, adverse actions, MIIs and SEs. A NOTAM may be
  released for any topic of high interest and broad application within the AFMS and DoD.
  Upon receipt, the organization risk manager/quality manager will disseminate the NOTAM
  throughout the facility. The responsibilities for NOTAM generation and dissemination are
  discussed below. MTF personnel shall review the suggested risk reduction strategies and
  incorporate quality improvement changes into their current healthcare practice. SG

   calendar days from payment notification date to coordinate AF/SG final SOC determination
   for all significantly involved provider(s) and submit the required DPDB and NPDB
   malpractice reports (DoDM 6025.13).
      10.10.3.1. If the final AF/SG determinations are not made within 180 calendar days of
      payment notification, AF/SG is to report all SIPs to the DPDB and NPDB for the
      payment.
          10.10.3.1.1. If at a later date the final SOC determination finds any of the provider(s)
          met the SOC, an amendment will be submitted to the DPDB and NPDB for those
          reports.
      10.10.3.2. Upon notification of an AD death (death benefit payment) or disability
      payment, AFMOA/SGHQ has 180 calendar days from payment notification date to
      coordinate AF/SG final SOC determination for all SIP(s).
          10.10.3.2.1. If the final AF/SG determinations are not made within 180 calendar days
          of payment notification, AF/SG is to report all significantly involved providers to the
          DPDB and NPDB for the payment.
             10.10.3.2.1.1. If at a later date the final SOC determination finds any of the
             provider(s) met the SOC, an amendment will be submitted to the DPDB and
             NPDB for those reports.
10.11. Roles and Responsibilities for Management of Malpractice Claims, Medically-
Related AD Deaths, and Disability Cases.

  separate or retire the member due to a disability associated with or aggravated by substandard
  medical care.
  10.12.3. If the SOC is other than ―met,‖ the case will be marked ―deferred‖ on the
  Worksheet and referred to a peer for a formal QOC with SOC review. Forward the case to
  AFMOA/SGHQ, who will coordinate the formal SOC review.
  10.12.4. If the MEB case has a SOC determination other than ―met,‖ the MTF will deem it a
  PCE, and all PCE procedures apply.
  10.12.5. All MEBs with a SOC ―not met, ―indeterminate‖ or ―deferred‖ will be referred to
  the MTF RM for immediate entry into CCQAS PCE module and will be sequentially

  directed by the AF/SG; when it is determined the disability/death payment was made for the
  provider’s failure to meet the SOC, which caused or contributed to the death or disability.
  10.12.13. If not completed within 180 days of disability payment notification, cases will be
  forwarded for reporting to the DPDB and NPDB as required. If at a later date the final SOC
  determination finds any of the provider(s) met the SOC, an amendment will be submitted to
  the DPDB and NPDB.
 214                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   10.12.14. In cases where probable disability payment will be invoked at a later time
   (member was injured as a result of substandard care yet desires to remain on active duty) and
   after the SOC reviews are completed and the AF/SG has determined that the SOC was not
   met, the AF/SG will direct reporting to the DPDB and NPDB other compensation program
   and financial payments made during the first year following the adverse event which resulted
   in injury to the member. The payments may include, but are not limited to: medical care,
   supplemental care costs, rehabilitative care, associated handicap provisions (wheelchairs,

   (radiology films, EKGs, monitoring equipment recordings, fetal monitor strips, etc.) involved
   in the incident of care that gave rise to the claim. Note: A certified copy of the medical
   records is sequestered; the original medical records remain in the medical record section for
   appointment availability.
   10.13.2. The medical records will be copied, numbered and then scanned onto CD-ROM
   (label CD with 10 U.S.C. §1102, HIPAA, and Privacy Act protection statements) for legal
   adjudication and clinical quality review processes as follows:
       10.13.2.1. For outpatient records, number the pages on the bottom right hand side from
       the earliest entry to the latest (most current) before copying and scanning the record.
       10.13.2.2. For inpatient records, number the pages on the bottom right hand side, from
       the latest (most current) entry to the earliest before copying and scanning the record.
       (This numbering is opposite from the outpatient record.)
   10.13.3. MTF RM organizes a QOC review with SOC determinations on every medical
   malpractice claim, medically-related AD death, and referred disability case (if not completed
   for the PCE process) to identify lessons learned, opportunities to improve care, and examine
   the systems, processes, and factors leading to the claim/case outcome.

  10.13.8. The MTF RM submits requested documents and evidence to the MLB at
  AFLOA/JACC or, for claims arising outside the 50 states, to the base legal office. These
  documents shall be scanned on a CD-ROM and include (but are not limited to):
     10.13.8.1. MTF QOC review to include SOC determinations on significantly involved
     provider(s), also include any medical literature used to support the standard of care
     determinations.
     10.13.8.2. List of significantly involved providers and their SOC reviews.
     10.13.8.3. DD Form 2526 on each significantly involved provider.
     10.13.8.4. Provider statement or memorandum for record (if submitted).
     10.13.8.5. Witness locator list (to include a permanent address, phone number, DEROS
     and/or separation date, if applicable).
     10.13.8.6. Applicable medical records and relevant evidence (staff schedules, on-call
     schedules, radiology films, consultation reports, etc), and relevant wing/medical group
     instructions, policies, and/or protocols.
  10.13.9. AFLOA/JACC will notify AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management Operations of final
  legal outcomes/settlements when received.
  10.13.10. MPRB Review Process. The MPRB reviews all SIPs by expert peer review.
  Following deliberations, the MPRB forwards SOC, DPDB, and NPDB reporting
  recommendations to the AF/SG. The AF/SG has final authority for SOC determination and
  reporting to the DPDB, NPDB, and other official agencies. AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk
 216                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   Management Operations will make reports to the DPDB, NPDB, and state regulatory
   agencies at the direction of the AF/SG.
       10.13.10.1. For each claim/case the MPRB will identify system issues, clinical lessons
       learned, and suggest policy initiatives, and clinical NOTAMS. This information will be
       sent to the MTF RM via closure documents.
       10.13.10.2. If MPRB determines a provider is not significantly involved in a claim, the
       provider will be removed from the claim, all documents (DD Form 2526, etc.) are
       destroyed and the provider is removed from the claim file in CCQAS. The MTF RM will
       be informed when a provider is removed, and will delete the document from the
       electronic PCF or destroy the paper DD Form 2526 if one was generated. The MTF RM
       will then notify the provider he/she has been removed from the claim.
   10.13.11. AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management Operations communicates final SOC
   determination and claim status via CCQAS Risk Management Claims Management Module
   to the MTF RM.
   10.13.12. AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management Operations reports to the DPDB and NPDB as
   directed by the AF/SG when the AF/SG determines the disability/death payment was made
   on behalf of the provider who fails to meet SOC.
10.14. Management of SOC Indeterminate in Paid Malpractice Claims, and Medically-
Related AD Death or Disability Cases. If the expert review of the claim/case finds SOC
indeterminate for a provider, AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management Operations will attempt to
obtain necessary documents (i.e., medical records, radiographs, etc.) to facilitate the expert peer
review. However, if SOC is indeterminate due to unavailable medical records or other relevant
evidence, this claim will be reviewed by the MPRB. If the MPRB concurs the SOC cannot be
determined, then a SOC indeterminate will be the final SOC recommendation to the AF/SG.
SOC indeterminate findings are not reported to the DPDB, NPDB, or other regulatory agencies.
10.15. External Agency (Civilian) Review of Medical Malpractice Claims.
   10.15.1. AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management Operations will forward a copy of each paid
   malpractice claim and Medically-Related AD deaths/disability cases when the SOC
   determination is deemed to be met or a system problem is identified (no individual breaches
   in the SOC identified), to an external agency for review IAW DoD 6025.13-R.
   10.15.2. AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management Operations will receive a written report from
   the external agency with a SOC determination on each SIP. If the SOC is determined not met
   by any individual provider(s), the provider(s) will be contacted by AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk
   Management Operations and afforded an opportunity to respond to this SOC determination,
   as outlined in paragraph 10.11.5.4.
   10.15.3. Any medical malpractice claim, Medically-Related AD death/disability case, with
   SOC not met determinations; will be processed through the MPRB. The AF/SG will review
   the MPRB recommendations and render the final decision on SOC determination and direct
   reporting to the DPDB, NPDB, and other regulatory agencies as appropriate.
10.16. Management of DD Form 2526 and Case Closure Documents:
   10.16.1. AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management Operations will annotate claim status and final
   SOC determination on the DD Form 2526. The completed form is available for the MTF RM
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                      217


   to download from the letters within the CCQAS RM module (not available from the PCE and
   disability sub-modules). Additionally, the final expert SOC reviews, closure documents, and
   lessons learned will be forwarded to the MTF RM.
   10.16.2. The MTF RM or designee will inform the SIPs of the final SOC determination, the
   claim outcome, and provide them a copy of their final DD Form 2526. The DD Form 2526
   will be sent, by certified mail, to last known address, if the provider has left employment
   with the Air Force. If the SIP has changed permanent stations, the current MTF RM will be
   responsible for sending the closure documents to the new MTF RM at the appropriate base. If
   the MTF is unable to locate the provider, notify AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management
   Operations for assistance with this notification process.
   10.16.3. The MTF RM will ensure the DD Form 2526 is uploaded to the provider’s
   electronic PCF. Non-privileged healthcare professional’s DD Form 2526 will be maintained
   in a folder by the MTF RM in a secure location (this file will be regulated like the PCF is for
   the privileged provider).
   10.16.4. For residents, a copy of the DD Form 2526 will be maintained in the training folder
   and a copy forwarded to the residency program director. If the resident has completed the
   residency program and PCSd as a privileged provider, a copy of the DD Form 2526 will be
   forwarded to the gaining MTF for placement in the electronic PCF.
   10.16.5. Providers found to be not significantly involved by the AF/SG shall be notified that
   they have been removed from the claim. MTF RM will ensure the credentials office is
   notified and the DD Form 2526 is removed from the provider’s electronic credential file (or
   an appropriate folder for non-privileged providers). Providers are not obligated to report
   claims in which they have been found not significantly involved. Both the electronic PCF
   and CCQAS files will be revised to remove this claim information.
   10.16.6. The MTF medical malpractice claim, medically-related AD death, and disability
   payment case documentation shall be maintained for a minimum of ten years after closure
   (medical records are returned to medical records administration circulation after the
   claim/case is closed). Maintaining claims/cases is necessary for future responses to claim
   histories for healthcare providers. After that time period, the claim/case documentation will
   be shredded. AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management Operations will archive a complete copy of
   the claim/case.
10.17. NPDB, DPDB, and Regulatory Agency Reporting.
   10.17.1. The AF/SG has sole responsibility for reporting malpractice claims, medically-
   related AD death, and disability cases to the DPDB, NPDB, State Licensing Boards, and
   other regulatory agencies. Malpractice claim cases are also reported to the NPDB for all
   privileged and non-privileged SIPs found not to meet the SOC. By law, claims under the
   FTCA and MCA are brought against the United States and not individual providers within
   the AFMS. Due to these unique legal circumstances, DoD identifies SIPs and makes SOC
   determinations for those providers, before reports are made to the DPDB and NPDB as
   outlined in the formal agreement with Department of Health and Human Services. Reporting
   to the DPDB and NPDB applies to physicians, dentists, nurses and other healthcare providers
   who are required to possess a state license, registration, or certification to perform patient
   care duties or anyone who holds themselves out to be authorized to deliver healthcare.
 218                                                                AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   10.17.2. All healthcare workers reported to the DPDB and NPDB will be notified by
   AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management Operations of the report and will receive a copy of a
   report from the NPDB. The MTF will also obtain and maintain a copy of the NPDB report in
   the appropriate file (PCF or secured risk management file for the non-privileged provider).
   The NPDB report is also annotated in CCQAS credentials file and risk management module
   (DPDB).
10.18. Reports to State Boards of Licensure. In every malpractice claim or medically-related
active death/disability case, when a report is sent to the DPDB and NPDB, a duplicate report is
sent to the individual’s state board(s) of licensure. Only AFMOA/SGHQ may make a report to a
state board of licensure, unless it specifically delegates that authority in specified circumstances.
10.19. Reporting Healthcare Trainees and Clinical Supervisors to the NPDB. A healthcare
trainee is defined as any resident, intern, or other healthcare provider in a formal healthcare
training status. In malpractice claims that involve residents, both the healthcare trainees and their
respective clinical supervisor may be identified as SIPs. Therefore, both healthcare trainees and
clinical supervisors are afforded a right to respond to the claim. The following guidance will be
used in determining DPDB and NPDB reporting of these providers.
   10.19.1. If the AF/SG determines that a payment was made on behalf of a healthcare trainee,
   and the SOC was not met, the attending provider responsible for the care delivered will be
   reported to the DPDB and NPDB. In such cases, the trainee will not be reported.
   10.19.2. If the AF/SG makes a specific finding that the attending provider clearly met all
   reasonable standards of supervision and the trainee’s act or omission was outside their scope
   of practice, and the care did not meet standards and was not reasonably foreseeable by the
   attending practitioner, then the trainee (not the attending practitioner) will be reported to the
   DPDB and NPDB.
10.20. MTF Actions When Providers Separate While a Medical Malpractice Claim,
Medically-Related AD Death/Disability Case is Under Review:
   10.20.1. Separating providers, privileged or non-privileged, with medical malpractice claims
   or medically-related AD death/ disability cases pending must provide the RM/CM with a
   permanent address (home of record), phone number, and all active/inactive state license
   numbers. This information shall be maintained in CCQAS and/or other credentials/risk
   management files.
   10.20.2. If the base closes under BRAC, the MTF/CC or designee must ensure the entire
   claim file is sent to AFMOA/SGHQ, Risk Management Operations with the current address,
   phone number, and states of licensure of the healthcare worker.
10.21. Provider Responsibility for Notifying Future Employers of Malpractice
Claims. Regardless of the outcome of a malpractice claim SOC determination, healthcare
providers must disclose involvement in malpractice claims, as required by licensing or clinical
privileging entities and any professional liability carrier with whom they have personal liability
coverage. Although claims are filed against the government under the FTCA and MCA, and not
against individual providers, a provider may be required to disclose that he or she was
significantly involved in a claim(s) filed against the USAF.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                         219


10.22. Non-Personal Services Contract Providers. AF/SG has no authority to report these
providers to the NPDB for malpractice claims payment since they are independent contractors
and not DoD employees. The AF does not provide liability insurance coverage for non-personal
contract providers and, therefore, has no jurisdiction regarding NPDB reporting for medical
malpractice payments. These providers will be afforded the same rights to be notified of
involvement in malpractice claims made against the Air Force, including the right to respond to
AFMOA/SGHQ regarding an adverse SOC determination. AFMOA/SGHQ will notify the
MTF/CC and RM of the final SOC determination made on non-personal services contract
providers. The MTF/CC or designee will notify the Quality Assurance Personnel assigned to the
contract and the base contracting office IAW the provisions of the contract.
10.23. Air Force Medical Residents Working in Civilian/Department of Veteran Affairs
(VA) Institutions. Liability for residents working in civilian or VA institutions is governed by
AFI 44-108, Training Affiliation Agreements. Most of these agreements direct that the other
federal or civilian institution provide liability coverage for Air Force medical residents. If an Air
Force medical resident is involved in a malpractice claim and the civilian or VA institution pays
a claim on his or her behalf, then the medical resident is subject to the civilian or VA
institution’s procedures regarding NPDB reporting. The guidelines used by these agencies may
differ from AF procedures related to NPDB reporting.

Terms
Abeyance—The temporary removal of a privileged provider from some or all clinical duties to
non-clinical duties while an internal or external peer review or inquiry is done. It cannot exceed
30 days and is not considered an adverse action.
Active Medical Staff Appointment—Active medical staff member with all accompanying
responsibilities, functions, and duties within the medical staff. Full credentials review is required
for an active staff appointment. This appointment is granted to individuals exercising regular
privileges who have completed an initial medical staff appointment at a DoD MTF. They are
full-time staff members expected to participate fully in medical staff duties. Appointment status
reflects the relationship of the provider to the medical staff. At the time a provider is granted
privileges or has privileges renewed, he or she may also be granted a medical staff appointment
which runs concurrently with the privileges.
Adverse Events—Occurrences or conditions associated with care or services when they cause
unexpected harm to a patient during such care or services. These may be because of acts of
commission or omission.
Adverse Practice Action—An action against the practice of a non-privileged healthcare
provider. The practice may be restricted, reduced, or revoked, based upon professional
misconduct, impairment, or lack of professional competence that adversely affects the safe
delivery of healthcare. An adverse practice action can only be imposed by the MTF/CC after the
opportunity for a hearing has been afforded.
Adverse Privilege Action—Privileges are denied, suspended, restricted, reduced or revoked
based upon professional misconduct, impairment, or lack of professional competence. An
adverse action can only be imposed by the MTF/CC. The termination of professional staff
appointment based upon conduct incompatible with continued professional staff membership
might also result in an adverse privileging action.
Affiliate Medical Staff Appointment—This appointment is for medical staff members whose
medical staff responsibilities and duties are reduced or eliminated because of limited duty or
employment within the MTF. Full credentials review is required for an affiliate staff
appointment. Affiliate staff appointments may be given to individuals exercising regular
privileges who have completed an initial medical staff appointment at a DoD MTF, to
consultants, or to individuals who work in the MTF on a part-time basis. Appointment status
reflects the relationship of the provider to the medical staff. At the time a provider is granted
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                        233


privileges or has privileges renewed, he or she may also be granted a medical staff appointment
which runs concurrently with the privileges.
Centralized Credentials Quality Assurance System (CCQAS)—A web based for credentials,
privileging, adverse action and risk management database utilized within DoD. The CCQAS
software assists the credentials and risk managers with the control of credentials, managing the
credentialing/privileging process, adverse actions, medical malpractice claim process, report
generation, letter generation, MTF to MTF transfer of the electronic PCF, and inter-facility
transfer briefs. MTF credentials and risk managers use CCQAS information for generating DoD
and congressional reports, personnel management, quality assurance, and for performance
improvement activities.
Certification by National Agency—Recognition by a national certifying agency or association
for a particular professional group that an individual has the necessary training, background,
knowledge, and skill to provide quality care within the boundaries of the profession’s scope of
practice. The agency or association must be recognized as sufficiently rigorous to ensure
certified individuals possess the skills for independent practice within the Air Force Medical
Service, and must be among those listed in AFI 41-104, Professional Board and National
Certification Examinations.
Clinical Supervisor—That person who provides professional review of the clinical activities of
a professional peer/subordinate. This may be the chief of service or senior staff member of like
specialty or clinical service. For purposes of completing the AF Form 22 and recommending
clinical privileges this is a peer (if possible) who is a medical staff member and is the individual
best qualified, on the basis of background and training, to monitor the practice of the provider
under review.
Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS)—The CGFNS is an
internationally recognized authority on education, registration, and licensure of nurses
worldwide. The CGFNS was established to protect the public by ensuring that nurses educated in
other countries, who wish to practice nursing in the United States, are eligible and qualified to
meet licensure and other practice requirements. Further information may be obtained from:
http://www.cgfns.org.
Credentialing—The process of obtaining, verifying, and assessing the qualifications of a health
care provider to deliver patient care services in or for a healthcare organization.
Credentials—The documents that constitute evidence of appropriate education, training,
licensure, experience, and expertise of a healthcare provider.
Credentials Review—The credentials inspection and verification process conducted for
healthcare providers before selection for military service, employment, and procurement. The
credentials review process is also conducted for healthcare providers before medical staff
appointment and granting of clinical privileges, and is repeated at the time of reappointment and
renewal of privileges. This is based on the following four core criteria: 1) current licensure; 2)
relevant education, training, or experience; 3) current competence; and 4) ability to perform
requested privileges.
Credentials, Verified—Documents confirming authenticity has been obtained from the primary
(issuing) source. Confirmation, independent of the provider, is a key criterion. With respect to
credentials that will never change, once verified, confirmation of authenticity with the primary
 234                                                              AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


course need not be repeated during subsequent credentials review. However, State
licenses/certifications/registrations verifications, queries of the NPDB/HIPDB databanks and
current competency shall be accomplished at every granting and renewal of privileges. Note:
DPDB queries are only required upon renewal of privileges.
Current Competence—The state of having adequate knowledge, skills, ability, and behaviors to
perform the functions of a provider in a particular discipline. Current competence is measured by
meeting the following: 1) Authorized to practice a specified scope of care under a written plan of
supervision at any time within the past 2 years; or, completed formal graduate professional
education in a specified clinical specialty at any time within the past 2 years; or, privileged to
practice a specified scope of care at any time within the past 2 years, 2) Actively pursued the
practice of his or her discipline within the past 2 years by having encountered a sufficient
number of clinical cases to represent a broad spectrum of the privileges requested; and, 3)
Satisfactorily practiced the discipline as determined by the results of professional staff
monitoring and evaluation of the quality and appropriateness of patient care.
Defense Practitioner Data Bank (DPBD)—The automated information system maintained as
part of the Risk Management and Adverse Action Modules of CCQAS. It consists of data on the
professional competence and conduct of licensed healthcare providers and malpractice cases
involving the DoD, including all filed and paid claims. It also includes cases in which disability
system or other payments are made because of personal injury or death of a member of a
Uniformed Service caused by the failure of a provider to meet the professional SOC. It is
electronically monitored by the Department of Legal Medicine of the Armed Forces Institute of
Pathology.
Denial of Privileges—Refusal to grant requested privileges. An adverse denial of privileges (i.e.,
based on professional misconduct, impairment, or lack of professional competence) may only be
imposed by a privileging authority after the opportunity for a hearing has been afforded. An
adverse denial of privileges is reportable to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB). For
administrative denial of privileges refer to paragraph 9.27.3.6.
Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG)—Required for
graduates of medical schools located outside the US, Puerto Rico, and Canada. Since 1986,
before awarding ECFMG certification, the ECFMG performs primary source verification of
medical school graduation, requires the candidate to pass an English exam, and verifies the
candidate has successfully completed Parts I and II of the United States Medical Licensing Exam
(USMLE). The ECFMG will provide examination results, ECFMG certificate number, and
period of validity. A copy of ECFMG or Fifth Pathway certificates (if required) for international
applicants is verified through the Correspondence Department.
Failure Mode and Effects Analyses (FMEA)—A systematic, proactive method for evaluating a
process to identify where and how it might fail, and to assess the relative impact of different
failures in order to identify the parts of the process that are most in need of change. Selected
teams of cross-functional healthcare professionals use FMEA to evaluate processes for possible
failures and to prevent them by correcting the processes proactively rather than reacting after
failures have occurred. FMEA is particularly useful in evaluating a new process prior to
implementation and in assessing the impact of a proposed change to an existing process.
Feres Barred—Cases of actual or alleged medical malpractice torts for which Federal court
jurisdiction is not available under the Federal Tort Claims Act based on the Supreme Court
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                          235


decision in Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135 (1950), (and/or similar cases) that the military
disability system and other compensation programs, rather than tort litigation, provided the
exclusive remedies for military members killed or injured incident to Military Service. Although
payments under such military compensation programs that are a result of medical care are not
malpractice payments under NPDB rules, DoD 6025.13-R requires that they be reviewed for
reporting to the Defense Practitioner Data Bank. (Note: Although the "Feres doctrine" applies to
all tort cases, not just medical malpractice cases, the term "Feres barred cases" in DoD 6025.13-
R refers only to actual or alleged torts involving medical malpractice.)
Fifth Pathway—Fifth Pathway certification is equivalent to an ECFMG certification. The Fifth
Pathway program includes 1 year of supervised clinical education in a US medical school for US
college graduates who completed medical school in a foreign country and is administered by the
American Medical Association. For further information, access the American Medical
Association website at http:// www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/10255.html.
Focused Professional Performance Evaluation (FPPE)—The time-limited evaluation of a
provider’s competence in performing a specific privilege. This process is implemented for all
initially requested privileges and whenever a question arises regarding a provider’s ability to
provide safe, high-quality patient care.
Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB)—A national healthcare fraud and
abuse data collection program for reporting and disclosing adverse administrative actions against
personnel involved in the delivery of medical services. By direction of the ASD/HA, all
personnel assigned to the AFMS, including active duty, reserve, air national guard, civil service,
and personal service contract personnel, are subject to reporting to this data bank.
Healthcare Provider/Practitioner—Any physician, dentist, nurse, or healthcare practitioner of
one of the professions whose members are required to possess a professional license or other
authorization.
Healthcare Provider (NON—PRIVILEGED)—Staff members who do not have clinical
privileges, but who do possess a license, certification, or registration required by this instruction,
by other guidance, or by the MTF for practice. This may include pharmacists, clinical nurses
(registered nurses, licensed vocational nurses), emergency medical technicians, dental hygienists,
etc. It may also include practitioners who may be privileged according to this instruction, but
who the MTF has decided not to privilege (i.e., clinical social workers doing discharge planning
duties, dietitians working in the health and wellness center, etc.). It may also include providers in
graduate military education or other training programs who are not awarded clinical privileges.
Healthcare Provider (PRIVILEGED)—Military (active or reserve component) and civilian
personnel (Civil Service and providers working under contractual or similar arrangement)
granted privileges to begin, alter, or end a plan of treatment for a patient.
Healthcare Trainee—Any resident, intern, or other healthcare provider in a formal healthcare
training status.
Host State—The State in which off-base duties are or shall be performed.
Impaired Provider—A privileged or non-privileged provider who, by reason of alcohol or drug
abuse, emotional disturbance, or medical condition, has exhibited unprofessional conduct,
 236                                                                  AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


substandard medical practice, or professional incompetence which is, or is reasonably probable
of being, detrimental to patient safety or to the proper delivery of quality patient care.
Individual Practice Review (IPR)—another term used for focused professional practice
evaluation is a peer review of a provider’s practice through clinical records, on-site interviews
and observation, or TDY of a provider from another location (see paragraph 8.2.1.1. for M&E).
A peer is defined as a professional peer with similar training, clinical experience and AFSC. IPR
may be independent or part of an inquiry, and may or may not lead to an adverse action. If the
IPR finds no professional deficiencies or concerns, no adverse action need occur. If the IPR finds
clinical deficiencies that affect patient safety, an adverse action may be necessary.
Initial Medical Staff Appointment—Appointment status reflects the relationship of the
provider to the medical staff. At the time a provider is granted privileges or has privileges
renewed, he or she may also be granted a medical staff appointment. This medical staff status is
granted to a provider during his or her first 12 months of practice within the Air Force Medical
Service, or after a period of greater than 180 calendar days without an active or affiliate medical
staff appointment in a DoD MTF. During this period, the medical staff member’s performance
will be under review by clinical supervisors for clinical competence as well as compliance with
the facility’s policies, procedures, bylaws, and code of professional conduct. During this period,
the member may also have supervised privileges based on lack of experience or lack of
proficiency in technical skill. An initial staff appointment leads to an active or affiliate staff
appointment and should be designated as such when granted (i.e., initial-active or initial-
affiliate). When designated in this way, the appointment indicates the medical staff
responsibilities of the target appointment. Initial appointments require full credentials review.
Inquiry—Search for, identification, and review of information related to a provider’s conduct or
condition that is, or may be, detrimental to patient care or safety.
Intentional Unsafe Act—Any alleged or suspected act or omission of a provider, staff member,
contractor, trainee, or volunteer pertaining to a patient involving a criminal act; a purposefully
unsafe act; patient abuse; or an event caused or affected by drug or alcohol abuse. Intentional
unsafe acts are matters for law enforcement, disciplinary system, or administrative investigation.
License—A grant of permission by an official agency of a US jurisdiction (a state/the District of
Columbia, commonwealth, territory, or possession of the US) to provide healthcare
independently within the scope of practice for the individual’s discipline within that jurisdiction.
A current, valid, unrestricted license is one which has not expired, been restricted, revoked,
suspended, or lapsed in registration and on which the issuing authority accepts, considers, and
acts on quality assurance information and continuing health education activities in determining
continued licensure or certification.
Unrestricted license, certification, or registration— is one not subject to restriction pertaining
to the scope, location, or type of practice ordinarily granted all other applicants for similar
licensure, certification, or registration in the granting jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions issue no-fee
licenses to Federal employees or military personnel. These licenses are acceptable, for non-
physicians/nurses only, if the issuing authority will exercise professional regulatory control over
individuals with these licenses and if the license is unrestricted. It also includes, in the case of
care furnished in a foreign country by any person who is not a US national, a grant of permission
by an official agency of that foreign country for that person to provide healthcare independently
as a healthcare professional.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                            237


Unrestricted license (for physicians and nurses)—One in which the individual has met all
clinical, professional, and administrative licensure requirements. The physician must have a
license that permits him or her to practice in the state immediately, seeing non-DoD
beneficiaries, without first taking any action on that license.
Unrestricted license (for non—physicians)—One in which the individual has met all clinical
and professional requirements, has no clinical limitations or restrictions, and is able to practice
full scope of care in the jurisdiction once all administrative licensure, certification, or registration
requirements are met. Therefore, for non-physicians, state waiver of renewal fees, malpractice
insurance, payment into risk pool, etc., is acceptable, as long as the license is clinically and
professionally equivalent to that of the individual’s civilian counterpart.
Limited Scope Medical Treatment Facility (LSMTF)—Medical element, flight, or small
medical squadron assigned to a line squadron or group (e.g. Air Base Squadron, Mission Support
Group or Air Base Group) with a credentialed medical provider. The LSMTF does not provide
the scope of services found in a medical group.
Malpractice payment—A monetary award under the authority of the Federal Tort Claims Act,
the Military Claims Act, or the Foreign Claims Act relating to the provision of healthcare
services under the organizational responsibility of the Department of Defense.
Medical Staff—That body of individuals within the MTF who hold privileges and who are
characterized by primary responsibility to the governing body for the quality of patient care
within the MTF.
Medical Staff Appointment—Appointment status reflects the relationship of the provider to the
medical staff. At the time a provider is granted privileges or has privileges renewed, he or she
may also be granted a medical staff appointment which runs concurrently with the privileges. A
medical staff appointment may not be made in the absence of granting privileges. A provider
may not admit patients without also being appointed to the medical staff. Medical staff
appointment may be revoked without revoking privileges. Privileges may be granted with or
without a medical staff appointment. The type of appointment will vary, depending on the
privileges to be exercised, the availability of the medical staff member to the facility, and the
reason he or she is practicing at the MTF. There are four types of medical staff appointment:
initial, active, affiliate, and temporary.
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)—M&E is a well-defined, time-limited, well documented
plan (list of specific questions, procedures, and concerns to be evaluated during the period of
clinical evaluation) of intensified peer review to confirm that a provider possesses the requisite
knowledge, skill, and training to render safe and appropriate patient care within their scope of
practice. It must include a documented plan with delineation of clear expectations and clear
measures of success that shall be coordinated through MAJCOM/SG. It consists of a formal
supervision of the provider either at his own or outside MTF. The duration of M&E is variable,
but often will last 2-3 months. The supervising peer is expected to provide specific written
assessment of the skills in question to the Credentials Function at the end of the M&E period.
Furthermore, the supervising peer is expected to conduct constructive feedback with the provider
throughout the M&E.
Military Health System (MHS)—The combination of military and civilian medical systems
used to provide healthcare to DoD medical beneficiaries.
 238                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB)—An information clearinghouse to collect and
release certain information related to the professional competence and conduct of physicians,
dentists, and, in some cases, other healthcare practitioners. The MHS reports medical malpractice
payment reports and adverse privileging actions to the NPDB.
National Provider Identifier (NPI)—The NPI is a standard unique health identifier for
healthcare providers. Effective 23 May 05 and IAW HIPAA Public Law 104-191, NPI Final rule
(45 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 162) requires that all providers apply for an NPI Type 1 by
23 May 07. This will be required for all privileged providers and residents (reference paragraph
6.39. for application process and additional information). IDMTs are also required to obtain an
NPI.
Near Miss—Any process variation or error or other circumstance that could have resulted in
harm to a patient, but through chance or timely intervention did not reach the patient. Such
events or circumstances have also been referred to as ―close calls‖ or ―good catches‖.
Never Events—A list of occurrences compiled by the National Quality Forum of inexcusable
outcomes in a healthcare setting. The list was compiled by the National Quality Forum. They are
defined as "adverse events that are serious, largely preventable, and of concern to both the public
and healthcare providers for the purpose of public accountability."
No Medical Staff Membership—Status of individuals who are not appointed to the medical
staff and are not members of the medical staff. These individuals do not share medical staff
responsibility to the governing body for medical staff surveillance, review, and performance
improvement activities within the MTF, though they may be significantly involved in these
activities.
Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation (OPPE)—A documented summary of ongoing data
collected for the purpose of assessing a provider’s clinical competence and professional
behavior. This information gathered during this process is factored into decisions to maintain,
revise, or revoke existing privilege(s) prior to or at the end of the two-year privilege renewal
cycle.
Other Authorizing Documents—Mechanism such as registration or certification by a US
jurisdiction (meaning a State/the District of Columbia, commonwealth, territory, or possession of
the US) grants authority to provide healthcare in a specified discipline; or in specialties not
licensed and where the requirements of the granting authority for registration or certification are
highly variable, the validation by a national organization that a provider is professionally
qualified to provide healthcare in a specified discipline; or in the case where healthcare is
provided in a foreign country by any person who is not a national of the United States, a grant of
permission by an official agency of that foreign country for that person to provide healthcare in a
specified discipline.
Peer—A professional peer with similar training, clinical experience and AFSC.
Peer Review—Peer Review is the activity of looking objectively at the quality of care and
practice of a provider. This is accomplished by peers looking at performance-based clinical
practice, records and other applicable data.
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                      239


Peer Review Panel—Panel appointed to review the clinical substantive matters of the case and
offer a recommendation to the credentials function regarding the provider
competency/impairment/misconduct and its effect on the delivery of healthcare.
Potentially Compensable Event—An adverse event that occurs in the delivery of healthcare
and services with resulting beneficiary injury. It includes any adverse event or outcome, with or
without legal fault, in which the patient experiences any unintended or unexpected negative
results. (Reference paragraph 10.8.2.)
Practitioner—See Healthcare Provider (PRIVILEGED).
Privileges—Permission, defining the scope of care, to provide medical and other patient care
services in the granting institution based on the individual’s education, professional license,
demonstrated clinical experience, clinical competence, ability, health, and judgment. Privileges
may be granted with or without an accompanying medical staff appointment.
Privileging (clinical)—The process whereby the MTF/CC or the MAJCOM/SG, upon
recommendations from the MTF credentials function, grants privileges and responsibilities to a
healthcare provider for specified patient care services within the MTF. Clinical privileges define
the scope and limits of practice for individual providers and are based on evaluation of the
individual’s credentials and performance.
Professional Medical Staff—Same as medical staff.
Provider Activity File (PAF)—A quality assurance file containing temporary provider-specific
information and performance data used to support the reprivileging process. It also contains risk
management data to include pending adverse action or potential malpractice data pending
resolution. It is an extension of the PCF and contains active QA documents protected from
disclosure by 10 U.S.C. §1102.
Provider Credentials File (PCF)—A folder or the electronic record within the CCQAS
database containing pertinent information regarding an individual privileged provider to include
credentialing and privileging documents, permanent performance data, medical practice reviews,
continuing health education documentation, and information related to permanent adverse
privileging actions. It is maintained in a secure manner and is protected from disclosure by 10
U.S.C. §1102.
Quality of Care Review With Standard of Care Determination—A process whereby systems
review, patient care, lessons learned, and other information is extracted from the evidence
involved in a PCE, and other medical events that have or could have put patients’ safety at risk
for use in performance improvement activities within the MTF.
Reduction of Privileges/Practice—The permanent removal of a portion of a provider’s clinical
privileges or a non-privileged provider’s practice. A reduction can only be imposed by the
MTF/CC after an opportunity for a hearing has been afforded. Reduction of privileges/practice is
reportable to the NPDB.
Regular Privileges—Privileges which grant the holder permission to independently provide
medical and other patient care services in the MTF, within defined limits. They are based on the
individual’s education, professional license and certification, experience, competence, ability,
health, and judgment. Regular privileges must be renewed at least every 24 months. NOTE:
Marking some privileges with supervision (code ―2‖) does not place a provider in the same

category as a provider granted supervised privileges. As long as the majority of privileges are
exercised independently, then granting regular privileges is the appropriate action.
Reinstatement of Privileges/Practice—A privileged provider or non-privileged provider has
restoration of clinical privileges or practice. Reinstatement may include provisions for
monitoring and evaluation to include the nature and duration of M&E. This is not an adverse
action and is not reportable to regulatory agencies; no hearing or appeal is offered.
Restriction of Privileges/Practice—A limit placed on all or a portion of the provider’s clinical
privileges or non-privileged healthcare professional’s practice so that the individual is required to
obtain concurrence before providing all or some specified healthcare procedures within the scope
of his or her license or registration. The restriction may require some type of supervision.
Restriction can only be imposed by the MTF/CC after an opportunity for a hearing has been
afforded. Restriction of privileges/ practice is reportable to the NPDB.
Revocation—An adverse action that permanently removes all clinical privileges or an individual
from all patient care duties. A revocation may only be imposed by the MTF/CC after the
opportunity for a hearing has been afforded. Revocation of privileges/practice is reportable to the
NPDB.
Root Cause Analysis (RCA)—A process for identifying the basic or contributing causal factors
associated with actual adverse events and near misses. An RCA includes the following
characteristics: the review is interdisciplinary in nature with involvement of those closest to the
process, the analysis focuses primarily on systems and processes rather than individual
performance, the analysis digs deeper by asking ―what‖ and ―why‖ until all aspects of the
process are reviewed and all contributing factors are identified, and the analysis identifies
changes that may be made in systems and processes through either redesign or development of
new processes or systems that may improve performance and may reduce the risk of actual
adverse events or recurrence of near misses.
Sentinel Events—Unexpected occurrences involving death or serious physical or psychological
injury or risk thereof.
Significantly Involved Provider—one who actively delivered care (based on clinical record
entries) in either primary or consultative roles during the episodes of care that gave rise to the
allegation, regardless of SOC determination. Additional defining characteristics include
providers who had the authority to recommend to start, stop, or alter a course of treatment; or
who had the responsibility to implement a plan of evaluation or treatment. Authority to
recommend means input was solicited and legitimate (i.e., the individual making the
recommendation was acknowledged to have special expertise or other specific standing in the
clinical issues). This term is not meant to include the providers who had only peripheral, yet
appropriate, patient interaction, nor those providers whose patient involvement was not
reasonably related to the specific allegations of sub-standard care and injury. For example, if the
allegation of the claim is ―a failure to diagnose‖, the provider who made the correct diagnosis
and treatment plan is not significantly involved in the claim since the provider made the
―correct‖ diagnosis.
Standard of Care—The accepted or correct actions of a provider, taken in order to arrive at a
diagnosis or to implement treatment for a given disease, disorder, or patient problem, adjusted
for the patient’s presentation and other conditioning factors. The standard of care is what is
AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011                                                                      241


generally accepted in the healthcare discipline or specialty involved as reasonable and
appropriate and is determined by peer review.
Substandard Medical Practice or Care—Medical care rendered to a patient that fails to meet
the accepted standard of care.
Summary Suspension—The temporary removal of all or part of a provider’s privileges, taken
prior to the completion of due process procedures, based on peer assessment or command, that
the action is needed to protect patients or the integrity of the command. A summary suspension
may continue until due process procedures are completed. Summary suspension of privileges is
not reportable to the NPDB, unless the final action is reportable.
Supervised Privileges—Privileges granted to providers who do not meet the requirements for
independent practice because they lack the necessary licensure or certification. However, all
minimal educational requirements must be met. They should be granted for recent accessions
without adequate documentation of current clinical competence, for providers who have not
clinically practiced for a period of 2 years or more, for those providers in an orientation period
required to assess competency, or at the commander’s discretion, pending completion of the
CHBC. Supervised privileges may be granted for up to 2 years and may be renewed by the
privileging authority in extenuating circumstances. The procedures for awarding supervised
privileges are the same as for regular privileges except that a clinical supervisor must be named,
in writing, at the time privileges are awarded, and a written supervision plan and schedule for
periodic report on the provider’s progress is outlined. The supervisor must be an MTF provider
who has regular privileges in the scope of practice for which they are supervising. The degree of
supervision required is determined by the clinical supervisor and must be appropriate to the
background, experience, and demonstrated skill of the supervised provider. Degrees of
supervision are described in the glossary, under ―Supervision.‖
Supervision—The process of reviewing, observing, and accepting responsibility for the
healthcare services provided by another healthcare professional. Levels of supervision are
defined as:
Direct Supervision. The clinical supervisor is involved in the decision—making process. This
may be further subdivided as follows: (1) Consultative -The supervisor is contacted by phone, e-
mail, or informal consultation before implementing or changing a regimen of care. The
supervisor conducts face-to-face, e-mail or telephone consultations and evaluations with the
provider over patient care issues on a regular, recurring basis; (2) Physically Present - The
supervisor is physically present through all or a portion of care.
Indirect Supervision.—The clinical supervisor performs retrospective record review of selected
records. Criteria used for review relate to quality of care, quality of documentation, and the
member not exceeding the authorized scope of care.
Note: Unless an individual is in a solo practice with no interface with a hospital or other
healthcare organization, all providers are supervised in some way, because of peer review,
clinical evaluation, and performance—based privileging. Every provider refers patients to
another provider when the case exceeds his or her scope of practice/expertise.
Temporary Medical Staff Appointment—Appointment granted primarily in emergency
situations. Granting of temporary appointments should be relatively rare, and then only to fulfill
pressing patient care needs. Temporary appointments are granted in situations where time
 242                                                                AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


constraints will not allow a full credentials review. Temporary medical staff appointment is
required when providers practicing under temporary privileges will be admitting patients. This
appointment runs concurrently with and for the same duration as the temporary privileges.
Appointment status reflects the relationship of the provider to the medical staff.
Temporary Privileges—Temporary privileges are awarded on an emergency basis to meet
pressing patient care needs when time constraints will not allow full credentials review. They are
time-limited to 5 calendar days. Credentials requirements for temporary privileges are
abbreviated as described in paragraph 6.27.3. to meet the urgent need for privileging. All
temporary privileges must be time-limited.
Unprofessional Conduct—Conduct either beyond or outside professional requirements for
rendering patient care, which adversely affects, or could adversely affect, the health or welfare of
a patient.
Verification—Confirmation of the authenticity of credentials reported by the provider using
primary or secondary sources. Primary source verification is accomplished through written,
telephonic, or electronic contact with the issuing agency (the primary source). The ―chain of
transmission‖ of the document or information is what distinguishes primary source verification
from secondary source verification. The document or information must come from the issuing
authority to be considered primary source verification. An example of secondary source
verification is to review a military provider’s personnel file to validate that postgraduate training
was done at a DoD facility. All verification must be documented.

practice settings, investigations conducted or limitations imposed by state licensing boards,
adverse actions, malpractice, etc.
A6.11. Paragraph 11 Provide the name, title, phone number, and FAX number of the
designated point of contact at the sending facility.
A6.12. General Comments:
   A6.12.1. Paragraphs applicable to healthcare providers from Reserve or Guard components:
   Provide the current civilian position, place of employment or facility where privileges are
   held, and the clinical privileges held by the healthcare provider. If the healthcare provider is
   self-employed, provide the healthcare provider’s office location. If privileges are held at
   several facilities, provide the name and location of the place or places where the majority of
   the practitioner’s practice is conducted and a list of the clinical privileges held which are
   applicable to the assignment prompting the use of the Transfer Brief. Additionally, include
   the address and business and home telephone numbers where the practitioner may be reached
   prior to reporting for the assignment and the name of the military treatment facility (MTF) or
   dental treatment facility (DTF) and dates of the last tour of clinical duty.
   A6.12.2. The Transfer Brief will be valid until expiration of the privileges upon which it is
   based. If the practitioner is assigned temporarily for several brief periods to the same
   location, the Transfer Brief remains valid over the duration of the combined periods, or until
   the privileges at the sending MTF/DTF expires. If other credentials have expired in the
   interim, telephonic or message confirmation of the renewal of the credential with the facility
   holding the PCF will suffice; i.e., a new Transfer Brief when the status of the provider’s
   privileges or medical staff appointment changes (e.g., change from supervised to regular
   privileges, renewal of privileges, adverse clinical privileging actions, etc.).
   A6.12.3. The Transfer Brief is joined with the formal application for privileges and
   supplants sections of applicable Military Service forms containing essentially like
   information. The Transfer Brief serves as PCF and is used in making the decision about
   whether the individual will be authorized to practice within the facility and what the
   individual will be authorized to do within the facility.
   A6.12.4. Credentials Functions in DoD MTF/DTFs will accept healthcare provider
   performance appraisals on other Service’s forms as their own.
   A6.12.5. MTF/DTF commanders may grant privileges based on the approved privileges list
   from the sending MTF/DTF by approving it with or without facility specific modification.
   The gaining facility may use its own customary forms or formats for notifying practitioners
   of their clinical appointments and documenting the same. Privileges applied for but not
   granted due to facility based limitations are not adverse privileging actions.

                    CONTENTS OF PROVIDER ACTIVITY FILE (PAF)

A7.1. The PAF is the principal repository for supporting information and data to validate
privileging of the provider at the institution. This is a QA document protected by 10 U.S.C.
§1102, and is kept separate from the provider credentials file. Data and information in the PAF
should include all practice pertinent materials which support the awarding of privileges. This
includes metric performance data. This information and data is summarized on the AF Form 22
which is maintained in the PCF.
A7.2. Listed below is data which may be included in the PAF. There is no specific format on
how the PAF is to be organized, what items are to be filed, or how data are to be presented in it.
It is not limited to only that information listed below but it should include copies of any pertinent
committee minutes, patient records, patient statements, and counseling statements that concern
the provider. The department or service should select those items which are useful for
monitoring the performance of its providers.
   A7.2.1. Baseline information and metric data:
       A7.2.1.1. For all providers:
           A7.2.1.1.1. Facility specific provider identification number
           A7.2.1.1.2. Attendance at required professional staff meetings
           A7.2.1.1.3. Data on number of duty days, clinical time (i.e., percentage of time spent
           on clinical activities, administration, etc.)
       A7.2.1.2. For outpatient providers:
           A7.2.1.2.1. Average daily/monthly patient load
           A7.2.1.2.2. Total annual visits
           A7.2.1.2.3. Number of emergency visits
       A7.2.1.3. For inpatient providers:
           A7.2.1.3.1. Number of admissions
           A7.2.1.3.2. Number of discharges
           A7.2.1.3.3. Number of procedures by category (i.e., deliveries, surgeries, etc.)
           A7.2.1.3.4. Number of special care admissions
       A7.2.1.4. For emergency providers:
           A7.2.1.4.1. Number of visits
           A7.2.1.4.2. Number of admissions/special care admissions
           A7.2.1.4.3. Number of special procedures (i.e., Thoracotomies)
       A7.2.1.5. For supervised providers
           A7.2.1.5.1. Periodic performance reports as required.
 258                                                               AFI44-119 16 AUGUST 2011


   A7.2.2. Outcome data on mortality, morbidity, and clinical monitoring data on performance
   parameters which may be used to support the AF Form 22 should be maintained and
   expressed in rates when possible. Further items to consider are:
       A7.2.2.1. Transfusion data
       A7.2.2.2. Medication usage
       A7.2.2.3. Department specific
   A7.2.3. Utilization data. Include appropriate data on usage of high cost resources such as
   CT/ MRI, high cost medications, blood product utilization. As UM data becomes more
   available, information on lengths of stay by ICD codes and other useful information on
   utilization should be identified and kept.
   A7.2.4. Risk management data. Synopsis of mortality and morbidity reviews, incident
   reports, serious events, malpractice claims, and applicable peer review materials should be
   included.
   A7.2.5. Patient generated data. Commendations/complaints with relevant reviews attached.
   A7.2.6. Other information:
       A7.2.6.1. Letters of appointment to staff positions/committee duties
       A7.2.6.2. Copy of curriculum vitae including any publications
       A7.2.6.3. Administrative data: rate of chart delinquency, documentation deficiencies,
       etc.
       A7.2.6.4. Participation in activities of benefit to military medicine
       A7.2.6.5. Teaching activities
A7.3. The specific clinical service needs to determine which parameters are most useful to
assess the provider’s performance. Some performance parameters evaluated will have
economic/utilization implications as well as clinical performance implications. It is not necessary
to include the information in both sections of the PAF.
A7.4. The PAF must be kept secure (locked drawer/room, same as historical PCF and working
credentials files). Providers may review the information in their PAF only under supervision.
The PAFs are usually maintained at the clinical supervisory level. However, some facilities may
opt to use a central maintenance method.

              PRIVILEGES (USED FOR PRIVILEGED PROVIDER)

MEMORANDUM FOR Name and Grade of Provider
FROM: Chairperson, Credentials Function
SUBJECT: Notice of Abeyance of Clinical Privileges
You are hereby notified that your clinical privileges are placed in abeyance as follows: (state
what privileges are affected, all, some (if some, state which ones). This action is being taken in
response to (state the issues involved, i.e., clinical deficiencies, substandard care events,
evidence of impairment, evidence of misconduct). These issues have had (or could potentially
have) the following adverse effects on patient safety and healthcare delivery (list the untoward
effects). (Include this sentence and state the duties assigned if provider is removed from all
clinical duties: During this period of abeyance you are assigned to the following duty (state the
duties assigned if the provider is removed from all clinical duties.)
Abeyance is a temporary removal of some or all clinical privileges for up to 30 calendar days.
An abeyance is not an adverse clinical privilege action; therefore, it does not mandate disclosure
in future official applications for state licensure or clinical privileges, nor is it reported to any
regulatory agency. If, at the end of the 30-day abeyance your privileges are not reinstated, the
action automatically becomes a summary suspension. A summary suspension is an adverse
privileging action, therefore, it does mandate disclosure in future applications for state licensure
and when applying for clinical privileges. A summary suspension is not reported to regulatory
agencies unless the suspension is the final action taken by the Air Force Surgeon General
(AF/SG) following due process procedures.
You are also notified that a Quality Assurance (QA) investigation will be conducted regarding
the allegations specified above. If, based on the QA investigation report there is a substantial
cause to proceed, a peer review panel will be conducted to review the evidence and make a
recommendation to the privileging authority. Should a peer review panel be warranted you will
receive written notification including when the panel will convene. The adverse action due
process is found in AFI 44-119, Medical Quality Operations, Chapter 9.
Providers who separate, retire, are discharged, or end employment with the Air Force while an
adverse action review is taking place may be reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank,
Defense Practitioner Data Bank, and state licensing agencies. You may request the review of
your clinical privileges continue following your (Note: Select applicable items: separation,
retirement, discharge, termination of employment, PCS). If you request continuation of the due
process, a report will not be made (if indicated) until completion of the due process. If you desire
a continuation, you must request it in writing prior to your (Note: Select applicable items:
separation, retirement, discharge, termination of employment, PCS). Address your request to me.
Permission to engage in off-duty employment is hereby (Note: Select applicable item: denied or
revoked) until further notice. During the period of abeyance, you will be temporarily assigned to
the duties noted above.
