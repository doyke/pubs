                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This instruction establishes requirements and grading criteria for ground and
flight phases of initial, requalification, and periodic flight evaluations. Aircrew evaluations will
be conducted IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202V2, AFSOCSUPP. Specific areas for
evaluation are prescribed to ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of
aircrews. Flight examiners use this AFI when conducting aircrew evaluations. Instructors will
use this AFI when preparing aircrews for qualification.
1.2. Applicability. This instruction applies to all individuals performing duties on PC-12 and
U-28 aircraft.
1.3. Keywords and definitions.
     1.3.1. “MUST”, “WILL” and “SHALL” indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.3.2. “SHOULD” is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
     accomplishment.
     1.3.3. “MAY” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.3.4. “Note” indicates operations procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
     emphasize.
1.4. Waivers. Waiver authority for the accomplishment of individual aircrew items on a case-
by-case basis is Major Command (MAJCOM) Director of Operations (A3) (e.g., HQ
AFSOC/A3). Waiver requests will be submitted through MAJCOM Standardization and
Evaluation (A3V) channels to the HQ AFSOC/A3. (T-2)
     1.4.1. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units will submit waivers to HQ AFRC/A3V
     for review, and will forward to HQ AFSOC/A3V for coordination and AFSOC/A3 approval.
     (T-2)
     1.4.2. Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk.
        1.4.2.1. “Tier 0” (T-0) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance
        is determined and waived by respective non-Air Force authority.
        1.4.2.2. “Tier 1” (T-1) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance
        may put airman, mission, or program strongly at risk, and may only be waived by the
        MAJCOM/CC or delegate with concurrence of publication approver. When multiple
        MAJCOMs are affected, then T-1 is appropriate.
        1.4.2.3. “Tier 2” (T-2) requirements are reserved for requirements that potentially put
        the mission at risk or potentially degrade the mission or program, and may only be
        waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate.
        1.4.2.4. “Tier 3” (T-3) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance
        has a remote risk of mission failure, and may be waived by the Wing/CC but no lower
        than the OG/CC.
1.5. Supplements. Units are encouraged to supplement this instruction with standard evaluation
profiles that best fit the unit’s mission, equipment, and location. MAJCOMs will forward a copy
AFI11-2U-28V2 9 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      5


of MAJCOM supplements to HQ USAF/A3O-AT, through HQ AFSOC/A3V, for approval.
Units below MAJCOM level will forward one copy of each supplement to their MAJCOM OPR
for pre-publication review. (T-2)
1.6. Evaluation Procedures. Before the aircrew briefing, the evaluator will inform the
examinee of any special requirements. Flight examiners will brief the examinee on the conduct,
purpose, and requirements of the evaluation, as well as all applicable evaluation criteria, prior to
flight. (AFRC only: Any unique evaluator inputs to the planned profile should be
communicated to the examinee no later than 24 hours prior to scheduled mission brief). The
examinee will accomplish all required mission planning. If an Operations Planning Team or
Deployment Planning Team accomplishes mission planning, the examinee is ultimately
responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all mission-planning paperwork. Flight
examiners will be furnished a copy of necessary charts, flight logs, mission folders, and any
additional items they deem necessary. (T-2)
   1.6.1. Flight examiners will ensure all required training and documentation is complete prior
   to initial or requalification evaluations.
   1.6.2. Unless requested by examinee and approved by squadron commander, the examinee
   will be current for all events evaluated during a periodic evaluation. (T-3)
   1.6.3. Flight examiners will not intentionally fail any mission essential subsystem list
   (MESL) equipment during flight evaluations, but may deny the use of systems not affecting
   safety of flight. Systems that can be denied in flight are as follows: Navigational aids or
   displays, Autopilot, Flight Director, flaps for no flap landings, primary trim controls, or the
   Power Control Lever for Manual Override Lever operations. Examiners may use reduced
   engine power settings for simulated engine out maneuvers.
       1.6.3.1. To maximize troubleshooting, flight examiners may fail mission equipment on
       the mission buses. These items are not required for flight, and will not be failed during
       critical phases of flight.
   1.6.4. Flight examiners will thoroughly debrief or critique all aspects of the flight. During
   the critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific
   deviations, area/subarea grades assigned, and any additional training required.
1.7. Grading Instructions. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2,
MAJCOM supplements, and this instruction. Examiners will use the criteria contained in this
volume to accomplish all flight, simulator, and emergency procedures evaluations. (T-2)
   1.7.1. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew
   member in order to successfully achieve the mission objectives and will be graded either Q
   or U. If an aircrew member receives an unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall
   grade for the evaluation will also be unqualified. Critical areas are identified by “(Critical)”
   in the area title. (T-1)
1.8. Evaluation Requirements. Evaluation profiles will reflect a sampling of the unit’s
missions. Evaluation tables are provided to summarize evaluation areas. Areas common to all
crew members are contained in Table 2.1. Instructor evaluation areas are in Table 3.1.
Evaluation areas unique to each crew position are located in their respective chapter. Each crew
specific chapter defines required events. Evaluation methods are identified by notes in the crew
 6                                                            AFI11-2U-28V2 9 OCTOBER 2014


specific tables and include: in flight only; in flight and/or in simulator (see Paragraph 1.8.1);
and in flight and/or alternate methods (see Paragraph 1.8.2). For areas without a note, flight
examiners may evaluate at their discretion if observed. If required events are not observed, then
the evaluation is incomplete and will be accomplished on another flight. (T-2)
     1.8.1. Simulator. Weapon System Trainers (WST) may be used to accomplish any
     evaluations if certified by AFSOC/A3. Do not conduct two consecutive evaluations in the
     simulator.
        1.8.1.1. If an area/subarea was not able to be evaluated in flight, and the event is certified
        for evaluation purposes in the simulator, it can be evaluated in the simulator to complete
        the evaluation. Document in the comments section of AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
        Qualification, which portion(s) of the evaluation were conducted in the simulator.
     1.8.2. Alternate Method. When it is impossible to evaluate an area in flight due to
     equipment malfunctions, operational requirements, scheduling restrictions, or weather, the
     area may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., procedural trainer or verbal examination).
     If, in the flight examiner’s judgment, an item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate
     method, complete the evaluation on an additional flight.
     1.8.3. Grading Criteria. To the maximum extent possible, flight examiners will use the
     grading criteria in this volume and AFSOCI 11-2U-28V2, to determine individual area
     grades. Exercise judgment when the wording of areas is subjective and when specific areas
     are not covered. Flight examiner judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the
     overall grade. Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade. (T-2)
        1.8.3.1. Base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stable
        aircraft. In some cases, momentary deviations are allowable provided the examinee
        applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize safety.
1.9. Unsatisfactory Performance. If the flight examiner observes an aircrew counterpart
jeopardizing safety, the examiner will assume the duties of that aircrew member (provided the
examiner’s basic Flight Duty Period (FDP) has not expired. If the examiner feels the examinee
can continue safely with supervision, the examiner is not required to assume the examinee’s
duties. If the flight examiner assumes the examinee’s duties, assign a Qualification Level 3 (Q-
3) as the overall grade. (T-2).
     1.9.1. Evaluators must report deviations or discrepancies from established procedures or
     directives in any area, regardless of the individual’s crew specialty, to the squadron or group
     commander, along with evaluator’s recommendation for corrective action, IAW AFI 11-
     202V2 and MAJCOM supplements. (T-2)
1.10. Additional Training. Flight examiners are responsible for assigning additional training at
their discretion.
     1.10.1. Additional training may be accomplished on the same flight as the evaluation,
     provided the unique situation presents a valuable training opportunity (i.e., crosswind
     landings), and the discrepancy requiring the additional training will not result in overall Q-3
     evaluation. This option requires flight examiner discretion and judicious application. The
     examinee must be informed when the additional training begins and ends. (T-2)
AFI11-2U-28V2 9 OCTOBER 2014                                                                     7


1.11. Rechecks. Rechecks will normally be administered by a flight examiner other than the
one who administered the original evaluation. (T-3)
1.12. Special Qualifications. Special qualification evaluations are administered for events that
are not universal to all members in that crew position. Special qualification evaluations may be
conducted separately or in conjunction with the qualification or mission evaluations. After
qualification, areas can be graded as part of periodic mission evaluations. There are no requisites
for special qualification evaluations unless specified. Refer to the appropriate crew position for
any special qualification evaluation requirements.
   1.12.1. Special qualifications result in an AF Form 8, documented as a SPOT evaluation.
   Although a unit may maintain 100 percent of its crew members qualified, this documentation
   is still required due to intrafly and permanent change of station issues.
1.13. Flight Evaluation Worksheets. AFSOC Form 48 generated flight evaluation worksheets
or electronic equivalent (Patriot Excalibur) are permitted to assist with the evaluation. If a
worksheet is used, it must be current in relation to requirements outlined in this instruction and
evaluation tables. (T-2)
1.14. Multiple Qualifications. The PC-12 Trainer and U-28 are different in mission design but
the same airframe model. Once differences training is complete, pilots may complete Instrument
(INSTM) and Qualification (QUAL) evaluations in the PC-12 Trainer, U-28, or approved
simulator. Once the INSTM/QUAL evaluation is complete, the qualification will be awarded in
both the U-28 and PC-12 Trainer. Mission (MSN) evaluations must be completed in a U-28 or
approved simulator. CSOs will complete QUAL and MSN evaluations in the U-28 or approved
simulator. (T-2)

                                             Chapter 2

                                      ALL EVALUATIONS

2.1. General. The general grading criteria contained in this chapter applies to all crew positions
and all evaluations. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform required
duties safely and effectively. This includes appropriate aircraft systems operation IAW
applicable technical orders, instructions, and directives. (T-2)
2.2. Requirements. Evaluate all crew members on areas listed in Table 2.1.
     2.2.1. Examinations. All crew members will complete open and closed book examinations
     as a requisite to periodic evaluations. Pilots will complete the instrument examination as a
     requisite to periodic INSTM evaluations. QUAL and MSN examinations may be combined
     and given as one examination. (T-2)
     2.2.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). An EPE is a requisite for all QUAL and
     MSN evaluations except for special qualification evaluations. EPEs may be conducted
     verbally, in flight, in a simulator, or by another method determined by the examiner or unit
     stan/eval. Operations Group Standardization and Evaluation (OGV) may develop EPE
     guides for each crew position for flight examiner use. EPEs should be scenario driven, and
     tailored to the specific crew position. The EPE will include areas commensurate with the
     examinee’s qualification and experience level. Examiners should include other general
     knowledge areas as well. For mission evaluations, evaluate mission-specific equipment and
     situations. EPEs will include sufficient in-flight and ground emergencies to evaluate the
     examinee’s knowledge of systems and procedures to the flight examiner’s satisfaction. (T-3)
        2.2.2.1. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in flight. The
        examinee should accomplish all Critical Actions Procedures (CAP) from memory and
        should provide the initial steps of the emergency procedures that, in the opinion of the
        examiner, would not allow time for reference.
        2.2.2.2. Grading criteria for EPE are outlined in area 5 of General Grading Areas.
     2.2.3. Publications Check. Required for all INSTM, QUAL, MSN, or combined
     evaluations (e.g. INSTM/QUAL/MSN) as outlined in area 12 of General Grading Areas.

     within specific grading criteria (mission planning, airmanship/situational awareness, crew
     coordination, communication, risk management/decision making, task management, and
     briefing/debriefing) and include all of the skills listed on the AF Form 4031, CRM Skills
     Criteria Training/Evaluation Form. Therefore, use of the AF Form 4031 is unnecessary for
     evaluations. (T-2)
