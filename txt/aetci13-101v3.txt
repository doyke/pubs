                                       OPERATIONS

1.1. General. The squadron DO is responsible for ensuring operations personnel are trained,
equipped, and available to execute the tasks associated with the unit’s training mission. (T-2)
This volume, in conjunction with other governing directives, prescribes procedures for DO’s to
employ at AETC’s battle management units under most circumstances. It is not a substitute for
sound judgment. Throughout this document, the term “operations personnel” is defined as all
personnel, to include commanders, operations supervisors, instructors, and students (initial
qualification training [IQT], graduate, and undergraduate) assigned or attached to the unit who
perform battle management duties during live missions.
   1.1.1. Waivers. Policy and procedures are enacted to provide for quality and consistency in
   training and evaluation. Occasionally, unique circumstances may warrant special
   consideration and possible waiver of policy provisions. At the same time, because it is
   important to preserve fidelity of training, evaluation, and policy implementation throughout
   the command, a process must be established for review of proposed waivers. Waivers that
   change the intent of the policy outlined in this instruction are not authorized without
   AETC/A2/3/10 (T-2) approval. Unless otherwise stated in this document, Wing/CCs (T-3)
   are the approval authority for individual personnel exceptions to the policy outlined in this
   instruction caused by special or unusual circumstances.
   1.1.2. AETC units will coordinate waivers through AETC/A3V. (T-2) Squadron
   commanders will submit all T-2 waiver requests through command channels in electronic
   format. (T-2) Waiver requests must provide justification why the individual or unit cannot
   comply with requirements. (T-2) Units will file a copy of approved written waivers to this
   volume according to AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. (T-1) Approved
   waivers affecting crewmembers must be written into the Additional Comments area of the
   AF Form 8. (T-2)
   1.1.3. The OG/CC of local supplements will handle waivers to unit supplemental guidance.
   (T-3)
1.2. Squadron Standards. To ensure unit personnel are familiar with the DO’s mission
execution expectations for students and cadre, each unit will establish and publish Squadron
Standards. (T-2) These standards provide the baseline procedures for conducting mission
planning, briefing, execution, and debriefing. Copies of unit Squadron Standards will be
forwarded to AETC/A3V upon publication. Squadron “voice tell” standards will be IAW United
States Message Text Format (USMTF), and Attachment 3, “Voice Tell Formats”. (T-1)
1.3. Squadron Duty Officer (SDO) Program. (N/A 173 OSS/C2). The SDO program
facilitates coordination between the control facility, Wing scheduling, Supervisor of Flying
(SOF), and fighter units. SDOs make current operations decisions on behalf of the Commander
and DO with regard to mission execution.
   1.3.1. Squadrons will develop and implement their own SDO program to meet the need of
   their specific Wing. (T-2)
 4                                                               AETCI13-101V3 27 MAY 2014


     1.3.2. Squadrons will establish certification criteria for SDOs. (T-2) At a minimum, SDOs
     will be BMC Air Weapons Officers (AWO)/Weapons Directors (WD) (exception, 607 ACS
     1C571Ds may perform duties with SQ/CC approval). (T-2) AR certification is desired (if live
     AR missions are conducted at the unit).
     1.3.3. Squadrons will establish a training program for SDOs. (T-2) At a minimum, review all
     applicable regulations that are related to safe operations and observe two sessions with a
     qualified SDO. (T-2) Squadron Operations Officer and/or Commander will meet with SDOs
     in training to provide guidance and expectations on SDO responsibilities. (T-2) Once all
     established training requirements are complete, certify SDOs on Letter of Xs. (T-2)
     1.3.4. SDOs will assume duty no later than one hour before first scheduled takeoff that the
     unit will control, and remain available through the entire daily flying schedule until the last
     scheduled control mission is handed off to ATC. (T-3)
     1.3.5. SDOs will lead a step brief with all controllers, Weapons Technicians (WT), Interface
     Control Technicians (ICT), Surveillance Technicians (ST), and Electronic Protection
     Technicians (EPT) prior to mission execution. (T-2) At a minimum, SDOs will ensure
     controllers are signed off on latest Flight Crew Information Files (FCIF), Special Interest
     Items (SII), DNIF/DNIC status, Risk Management (RM) checklist, and will notify controllers
     of any applicable mission changes (callsign, timing, airspace, etc.). (T-2)
     1.3.6. If equipment is available, SDOs will monitor the local SOF frequency and should
     have a tunable radio to monitor alternate frequencies. (T-2)
     1.3.7. Controllers or technicians (WT, ICT, ST, and EPT) will notify SDO immediately of
     any abnormal procedures and emergencies for aircraft under control. (T-2) SDOs will be
     prepared to coordinate with SOF, applicable ATC agencies, Wing scheduling, and fighter
     squadron Operations Supervisors (Top 3) as required. (T-2)
1.4. Weapons Control Procedures. Weapons control is defined as the control of offensive and
defensive counter air (OCA/DCA), air refueling (AR) missions, dynamic targeting (DT),
coordination of combat search and rescue (CSAR) operations, reconnaissance, airlift, electronic
attack (EA), special operations, emergency aircraft assistance, and direction of ADA Systems.
All control will be IAW with AFTTP 3-1, AFI 11-214, fighter brief, student syllabus, and
Squadron Standards. (T-1)
     1.4.1. Weapons Team. The Weapons Team will include the appropriate number of
     AWOs/WDs to provide control for all assigned aircraft. (T-1) If applicable, a WT will be
     assigned to assist with handoff and recovery of aircraft IAW applicable letters of agreement,
     as well as any assigned team contracts. (T-3)
        1.4.1.1. Handoff Procedures. Handoff procedures will be IAW applicable letters of
        agreement. (T-2) A member of the weapons team will monitor the handoff frequency
        and/or shout line at all times when performing station assumption duties and while on
        station. (T-2) A member of the weapons team will also monitor UHF Guard (and VHF
        Guard if capable). (T-2)
        1.4.1.2. Symbology and Tracking. During all operations, AWO/WDs will ensure track
        symbology and sensor data of controlled aircraft are within 2 NM of each other. (T-2)
AETCI13-101V3 27 MAY 2014                                                                        5


       1.4.1.3. Controlled Aircraft Emergency Procedures. For aircraft with in-flight
       emergencies, the AWO/WD will follow local wing procedures and FAA guidance. (T-0)
   1.4.2. (607 ACS ONLY) AF Form 4145, Daily Activity Log. The DO designee is
   responsible for the Daily Activity Log. The form is required to be completed and signed at
   the completion of each day and forwarded to the DO for approval and signature. The daily
   activity log provides a complete summary of all crew operations for a particular day and is an
   important tool for data correlation and analysis. (T-3)
   1.4.3. (607 ACS ONLY) AF Form 4146, Mission Briefing Guide. Use the Mission Briefing
   Guide to brief missions, record mission results, and serve as a record of unit control
   activities. AWO/WDs use the form for all control activities conducted and forwarded to the
   crew leader for review and attach to AF Form 4145, Daily Activity Log. (T-3)
1.5. Go/No-Go Procedures. Units will establish a positive control system that ensures all crew
positions participating in live operations have completed all training and stan/eval items required
for mission. (T-2) As a minimum, the Go/No Go system will monitor (T-2):
   1.5.1. The qualification, certification, and currency requirements from AETCI 13-101,
   Volume 1 and Volume 2, required for control.
   1.5.2. Anyone participating in live operations that are Duty Not Involving Flying (DNIF) or
   Duty Not Including Control (DNIC) status.
   1.5.3. Currency on all FCIF items.
   1.5.4. Risk Management (RM) Checklist completion.
1.6. Crew Rest. Minimum crew rest period is eight hours. (T-3) This provides the individual a
minimum of eight hours of uninterrupted rest. If crew rest is interrupted so that an individual
cannot get eight hours of uninterrupted rest, the individual must be afforded eight more hours of
uninterrupted rest. Any interruption must be made only under the most exceptional
circumstances. (T-3) Waivers to this policy are granted on a case by case basis. (T-3) Duty day
requirements are IAW SQ/DO directives but will not normally exceed 16 hours without SQ/CC
approval.
1.7. Controlling While Under the Influence. A person will not participate in operations under
the following conditions:
   1.7.1. While under the influence of alcohol or it’s after effects. Alcohol and its after effects
   can affect control or flight duties that impact safety of flight. No crew member shall consume
   alcoholic beverages during the 12 hours preceding any operational crew duties. (T-1)
   1.7.2. While under the influence of or using a drug that affects the ability to safely perform
   assigned duties. Crew members (13B, 1C5, and GS) will not self-medicate except IAW
   provisions allowed by AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards. (T-1)
   1.7.3. If physical condition is suspect or known to be detrimental to the safe completion of
   crew duties. (T-1)
1.8. Standardized Aviation RM Checklist. The aviation RM checklist is the AETC standard
RM tool for all aviation operations. While RM happens during all phases of the mission, the RM
checklist is the pre-mission tool to identify operational hazards, encourage risk management
strategies, and empower the correct level of leadership in mission decisions.
 6                                                               AETCI13-101V3 27 MAY 2014


     1.8.1. Units will use an individual RM checklist for use on every mission (Attachment 2).
     (T-2) The RM checklist is an individual responsibility. For students, the completed RM
     checklist is the responsibility of the assigned instructor. (T-3)
     1.8.2. Squadron commanders will (T-2):
        1.8.2.1. Identify hazards to mission success to account for unique local, mission, aircraft,
        and personnel hazards.
        1.8.2.2. Assign numerical values to each hazard or hazard category. The numerical value
        reflects the unit commander’s assessment of the probability and severity of ill effects
        potentially resulting from exposure to a hazard.
        1.8.2.3. Quantitatively categorize mission risk as LOW, MODERATE, HIGH, or
        SEVERE based on the assigned risk values.
        1.8.2.4. Direct elevation of the decision authority based on the mission risk category.
     1.8.3. Crew members will (T-2):
        1.8.3.1. Complete the unit’s RM checklist and submit the results to the SDO (senior
        controller for 173 OSF/C2) prior to assuming weapons team duties.
        1.8.3.2. Analyze and apply risk control measures—strategies and controls that reduce or
        eliminate risk—to reduce the probability, severity or exposure of risk.
        1.8.3.3. Elevate the mission decision authority when directed by the unit RM checklist.
        1.8.3.4. When appropriate, include the RM checklist in mission debriefings.
        1.8.3.5. Document mission approval on the RM checklist. The decision authority’s
        initials or an entry on an electronic checklist are adequate.
     1.8.4. Units will maintain the RM checklist for each mission until mission accomplishment.
1.9. Voice Tape Recording. Tape recording live missions is essential to provide necessary
information concerning aircraft accidents, aircraft emergencies, and/or any event resulting in a
subsequent investigation. Tape recording also provides a valuable asset in the formal training
environment. All units will record and maintain audio (and video if able) history for a minimum
of 15 days. (T-2)
1.10. Guest Controller/Technician. Individuals in TDY status to a unit must complete, as a
minimum, the directed training and Stan/Eval requirements below prior to performing
operational duties. (T-2) Unit operations training officers (OTO) must determine whether the
individuals will control/operate in a supervised or unsupervised situation. (T-2) If unsupervised
by a qualified instructor, the guest controller/technician must be qualified by unit stan/eval. (T-3)
If the individual will control/operate in a monitored environment, then a unit certification
managed by the OTO will suffice. As a minimum, guest controllers must provide proof that they
are medically cleared for controlling duties (AF 1042 or equivalent) as appropriate, and are a
qualified Ground Controlled Intercept (GCI) Controller on a battle management system (AF
4143/Form 8 or equivalent). (T-2)
     1.10.1. The OTO will ensure completion of the following (T-2):
        1.10.1.1. Local Procedures briefing
AETCI13-101V3 27 MAY 2014                                                                    7

                         OPERATIONS INFORMATION FILE (OIF)

2.1. General. An OIF is required for the conduct of battle management operations and training
within AETC. The OIF is the organization’s functional publications library for operations-related
publications. The OIF will maintain information essential to the conduct of operations and/or
emergency conditions, and must be available to all operations personnel performing duties or
training involving live flying. (T-2)
2.2. Procedures.
     2.2.1. Units will maintain an OIF consisting of the items listed in Table 2.1 in either
     hardcopy or electronic format. (T-2) The OG/OGV is responsible for OIF standardization for
     subordinate flying organizations and is the focal point for any data to be entered in the OIF.
     (T-3) The OG/OGV may maintain a web-based OIF resource, but is still required to notify
     subordinate units of new items. (T-2) NOTE: If squadrons maintain a separate OIF from
     OGV, they will appoint, in writing, an OIF custodian to ensure proper maintenance as
     directed by this instruction. (T-2)
     2.2.2. Establish an OIF at a central location, preferably current operations, accessible to each
     location where live missions are controlled. (T-2) The squadron operations officer will
     ensure the contents of the OIF are handled discriminately and the required security for the
     files is provided at all times. (T-2)
     2.2.3. Due to space limitations, the squadron operations officers will determine what
     information is required in the appropriate operations rooms to support requirements. (T-2) As
     a minimum, OIF Volume I will be readily accessible in a central location. (T-2) Volumes II-
     V are for reference only and may be kept at a location determined by the squadron operations
     officer. Secure classified material of the OIF in a storage container according to DoD 5200.1-
     R and AFI 31-401. (T-1)
     2.2.4. If other operational documents not specified in this instruction or group supplements
     are maintained, add them in the appropriate indexes, and file them in the appropriate book or
     section. (T-2)

2.3. Volume I, Table of Contents/Current Read File (CRF). Volume I consists of three parts:
A, B, and C. Part A is a table of contents (master index) listing all material contained in OIF
AETCI13-101V3 27 MAY 2014                                                                       9


Volumes I through V, and the appointment memorandum for the OIF custodian. Part B is the
CRF of FCIF messages. Part C is the CRF that contains general information.
   2.3.1. Part A will contain the appointment memorandum for the OIF custodian (OGV or
   squadron) and the Master Index (Table of Contents). (T-2) The Master Index reflects those
   documents required in all volumes of the OIF. List FCIFs, SIIs, memorandums of agreement
   (MOA), and operating instructions individually indicating number, date, and title, as
   applicable. (T-2)
   2.3.2. Part B contains the CRF of FCIF messages. (T-2) FCIF Messages contain information
   temporary in nature, directly pertinent to the safe conduct of flight, and must be read before
   performing live operational duties. (T-2)
      2.3.2.1. FCIF signoff will be accomplished via either a read-and-initial AETC Form
      1138A (or MAJCOM-approved form) or computer-based system, for all operations
      personnel, to indicate understanding and compliance. (T-2) If desired, units may enter
      student class number in the Office Symbol block for all graduate and undergraduate
      students to facilitate tracking. Individuals attached to an AETC air control squadron,
      regardless of period of time, will initial the AETC Form 1138A after reviewing all
      current material before conducting live flying operations. (T-2)
          2.3.2.1.1. List all new material requiring immediate attention, to include publications,
          memorandums, messages, and operations plans and orders, on this form along with
          the date entered; then place the material in the appropriate sections. (T-2)
          2.3.2.1.2. If a document is rescinded prior to an individual’s review (due to
          temporary duty [TDY] or absence from the unit), annotate not applicable (NA) in the
          person’s initial block on AETC Form 1138A. (T-2)
          2.3.2.1.3. Only remove AETC Forms 1138A for graduate and undergraduate students
          enrolled in AETC formal courses after they have graduated and departed for their
          next assignment, to include those in casual status conducting live operations. (T-2)
          2.3.2.1.4. If FCIFs and CRFs are managed electronically (programs such as PEX or
          GTIMS), supplement Part B with an MFR stating how this is managed. (T-2) All
          requirements and controls prescribed for the use of the AETC Form 1138A will apply
          to the computer-based system. (T-2) For example, where there is a requirement for
          personnel to indicate understanding and compliance with new FCIF or CRF items
          through initialing, the computer-based system will track the review of the items by all
