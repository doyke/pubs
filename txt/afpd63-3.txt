2. When appropriate, the Air Force will use effective competition strategies and commercial practices to
obtain the best technical solution, quality, schedule and price attainable. Air Force activities will conduct
market research to determine whether commercial items or non-developmental items are available to
meet the agencyâ€™s requirements.
When available, activities will acquire commercial items or non-developmental items using applicable
commercial practices. The acquisition strategy should reflect consideration of competition and commer-
cial practices throughout the process.
