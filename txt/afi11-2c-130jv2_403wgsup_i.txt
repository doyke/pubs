         1.8.3.1.3. (Added-403WG) Mission evaluation profile binders for all crew positions
         are located in each Squadron DOV. These binders include standard profiles/criteria
         for mission, instrument, qualification evaluations, and EPEs/3862s for each type of
         evaluation. Evaluators will use these binders to ensure the various types evaluations
         are standardized within the squadron/wing.
     1.8.3.2. For units/aircrew with an airdrop requirement, MSN evaluations for all crew
     positions should include actual airdrop loads, if possible. For units/aircrew with a NVG
     requirement, MSN evaluations for all crew positions should be at night utilizing NVGs if
     scheduling permits.
  1.8.4. Instructor (INSTR) Evaluations. See AFI 11-202 Volume 2 for Instructor Evaluation
  requirements. Aircrew members designated as instructors will be evaluated on their ability to
  instruct during all periodic evaluations. Crewmembers may use their initial INSTR
 8                                          AFI11-2C-130JV2_403WGSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013


     evaluation to satisfy the requirements of a periodic evaluation provided all evaluation
     requirements for the periodic evaluation are met. Evaluation may be in WST for pilots and in
     an ATD for loadmasters.
     1.8.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). Use AFI 11-202, Volume 2 and the
     following: Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of emergency procedures (EPs) and
     aircraft systems knowledge for all QUAL and MSN evaluations. The EPE will include areas
     commensurate with the examinee’s graduated training (e.g., initial, line, instructor, or
     evaluator). See specific crew position chapters of this AFI for EPE requirements.
        1.8.5.1. OGVs will develop and maintain a list of EPE program requirements (topics,
        special interest etc.). An EPE guide for each crew position will be developed detailing the
        evaluation areas and conduct of the EPE. Examiners may use one continuous scenario
        throughout the EPE, or may use different scenarios as required to ensure appropriate
        areas are evaluated.
        1.8.5.2. EPEs should not be conducted immediately before or during a flight evaluation.
        When possible, EPEs should be conducted in an ATD. If an ATD is not available, the
        EPE may be verbally evaluated. Examinees may use publications normally available in
        flight. The examinee must recite, perform, or write all Boldface items.
        1.8.5.3. Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified will be placed in
        supervised status until recommended additional training and re-evaluation are completed.
        Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified because of unsatisfactory
        Boldface procedures will not be permitted to fly until a successful re-evaluation is
        accomplished. Accomplish additional training IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
1.9. Grading Policies.
     1.9.1. When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not possible, the area may be verbally
     evaluated. Flight examiners will make every effort to evaluate all required areas in-flight or
     in an ATD before resorting to this provision. If an alternate method is used to complete the
     evaluation, document in the Additional Comments portion of the AF IMT 8. Use of this
     provision must be approved by the examinee’s commander. The commander’s signature on
     the AF IMT 8 acknowledges this provision has been approved.
     1.9.2. Do not verbally evaluate takeoffs, instrument approaches, landings or cargo loading
     that fulfill minimum evaluation requirements listed in and .
     1.9.3. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew member
     in order to achieve the mission objectives successfully. If an aircrew member receives an
     unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will be unqualified.
     Critical areas are identified by “(Critical)” following the applicable area title, and the shading
     of the Q- block on the AF IMT 3862, Flight Evaluation Worksheet. See examples at and .
     1.9.4. Crew Resource Management (CRM). If CRM is downgraded during the evaluation,
     the evaluator will also complete an AF IMT 4031, CRM Skills Criteria
     Training/Evaluation. The completed IMT will be forwarded to OG/OGV, for inclusion in
     quarterly trends, and wing training so that the data can be passed to the MAJCOM CRM
     program manager.
1.10. Conduct of Evaluations.
AFI11-2C-130JV2_403WGSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013                                                         9


   1.10.1. Flight examiners will pre-brief the examinee on the purpose, conduct, requirements
   and general criteria of the evaluation. Flight examiners will then evaluate the examinee in
   each area/sub-area.
   1.10.2. Flight examiners should not evaluate personnel they have primarily trained or
   recommended for upgrade. Flight examiners should normally not evaluate personnel who
   serve as rating officers on their performance reports.
   1.10.3. Aircrew Training System (ATS) contractors will not be in the seat during evaluations
   in an ATD.
   1.10.4. Unless otherwise specified, flight examiners may conduct the evaluation in any crew
   position or seat which will best enable the flight examiner to observe the examinee’s
   performance.
   1.10.5. Evaluators will note discrepancies and deviations from prescribed tolerances and
   performance criteria during the evaluation. They will compare the examinee’s performance
   with the tolerances provided in the grading criteria and assign an appropriate grade for each
   area.
       1.10.5.1. An evaluation will not be changed to a training mission to avoid documenting
       substandard performance, nor will a training mission be changed to an evaluation, with
       the exception of a N/N evaluation.
       1.10.5.2. The judgment of the flight examiner, guidance provided in AFI 11-202,
       Volume 2, and this AFI, will be the determining factors in assigning an overall
       qualification level on the AF IMT 8. The flight examiner should thoroughly critique all
       aspects of the flight. During the critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee’s
       overall rating, specific deviations, area/sub-area grades assigned, and any additional
       training required.
   1.10.6. In the event of unsatisfactory performance, the flight examiner will determine
   recommended additional training requirements. Required additional training will not be
   accomplished on the same flight. EXCEPTION: Additional training on the same flight is
   allowed when unique situations presenting valuable training opportunities exist (i.e.,
   thunderstorm avoidance, crosswind landings). This option requires flight examiner discretion
   and judicious application. When used, the examinee must be informed when the additional
   training begins and ends.
       1.10.6.1. An ATD may be used to accomplish additional training and rechecks. Areas for
       additional training and rechecks should be limited to those areas/sub-areas that can be
       realistically accomplished in an ATD.
       1.10.6.2. The flight examiner who administered the original evaluation should not
       administer the recheck.
       1.10.6.3. (Added-403WG) The flight examiner or squadron chief of Stan/Eval shall
       advise squadron commanders or operations officers on all evaluations where the
       examinee receives an overall grade of Q-2 or Q-3 as soon as possible after the evaluation.
1.11. Use of IMT Form 3862, Flight Evaluation Worksheet. Units (normally the OGV) will
complete the AF IMT 3862, using the examples in and to use as an evaluation worksheet,
entering each title, area number and text (in the order illustrated). Units may add special interest
 10                                       AFI11-2C-130JV2_403WGSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013


items and/or local evaluation requirements. The worksheet should be used in flight to ensure all
required areas are evaluated. The completed worksheet will serve as a temporary record of the
evaluation and will be filed in the aircrew member’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) until the AF
IMT 8 is completed and filed.
1.12. Aircrew Testing.
   1.12.1. Open-Book Exam. An open-book examination is a requisite for QUAL and MSN
   evaluations. The open-book QUAL exam will consist of a minimum of 60 questions. The
   open-book MSN exam will consist of a minimum of 40 questions, at least 25% of which will
   come from tactical doctrine documents related to C-130J combat operations (AFTTP). If a
   combined examination is created for combination evaluations (QUAL/MSN), it will have the
   appropriate number of questions for each portion. For periodic INSTR evaluations, a portion
   of the open-book exam will include instructor questions. A separate (unique) INSTR open-
   book exam is not required.
   1.12.2. Closed-Book Exam. A closed-book examination is a requisite for QUAL evaluations.
   The exam will consist of a minimum of 20 questions from the Master Question File (MQF).
   1.12.3. Boldface exam. A boldface exam is a requisite for any periodic evaluation.
1.13. Typical C-130J Evaluation Profile(s). Unit OG/CC or OG/OGV will determine the
evaluation profiles suitable for aircrew evaluations. These profiles will include all required items
in and and include a sampling of other items.
1.14. Multiple C-130J Model Certifications. Accomplish difference training IAW AFI 11-2C-
130J Volume 1, Aircrew Training (pending). A periodic evaluation may be accomplished in any
aircraft model in which the individual is certified.
AFI11-2C-130JV2_403WGSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013                                                      11


                                           Chapter 2

                                   PILOT EVALUATIONS

2.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic, and re-qualification evaluations,
including requirements for instrument/qualification, mission, and instructor evaluations.
   2.1.1. Flight examiners will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations,
   but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight.
   2.1.2. Under no circumstances will a flight examiner allow the aircraft to slow below one
   engine-out Vmca or exceed aircraft limitations specified in the flight manual, regardless of
   tolerances listed for specific areas.
   2.1.3. If the flight manual recommends a specific airspeed range for performance of a
   maneuver, the flight examiner will apply the grading criteria to the upper and lower limits of
   that range.
   2.1.4. Evaluator pilots may conduct evaluations when scheduled as primary aircrew
   members.
       2.1.4.1. (Added-403WG) Evaluator pilots will not be scheduled as primary
       crewmembers without Squadron DOV approval. Instructor Pilots will normally be
       scheduled to fly with examinees for instrument/qualification evaluations.
   2.1.5. Pilots may be evaluated in either the left or right seat. The term “Pilot” also includes
   Mobility Pilot Development (MPD) pilots. Pilots who are not Aircraft Commanders will
   have a crew position of “FP” on their AF form 8. The “MP” crew position will be used on an
   AF form 8 for Aircraft Commanders and when the evaluation concludes training leading to
   certification as an Aircraft Commander (such as an Operational Mission Evaluation).
   2.1.6. DELETED
2.2. Instrument/Qualification Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Requalification). C-130J
INSTM evaluations will be flown concurrently with QUAL evaluations. The profile will include
the following:
   2.2.1. A minimum of one precision, one non-precision, and one Category II (if qualified)
   approach will be flown. Do not combine the precision and Category II approaches. One of
   the approaches will be flown without use of the autopilot and autothrottles. Initial CAT II
   qualification evaluations require an approach to a missed approach and an approach to a
   landing. CAT II procedures may be evaluated on a CAT I approach. If possible, approaches
   should be flown to airfields other than home station or deployed locations.
   2.2.2. Holding or a Procedure Turn will be accomplished.
   2.2.3. Circling and a VFR pattern are required if weather and traffic permit..
   2.2.4. Simulated Emergency procedures will include: 3-engine instrument approach, 3-
   engine go around, and a 3-engine landing.
   2.2.5. A full (100%) and a partial flap (50% or 0%) landing is required as well as touch and
   go procedures.
 12                                       AFI11-2C-130JV2_403WGSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013


2.3. Mission Evaluations (Initial, Periodic, and Requalification). C-130J MSN evaluations
may be accomplished in conjunction with the INSTM/QUAL evaluation. Depending on the
unit’s mission, or crewmember’s qualification, the MSN evaluation will consist of an airdrop
profile, a maximum effort profile, and/or formation procedures. NVG usage and actual airdrop
loads are desired.
   2.3.1. The maximum effort profile will consist of a maximum effort takeoff, tactical
   approach and maximum effort landing. The tactical approach will consist of either a high or
   low altitude tactical arrival. Landings will be performed on an actual landing zone, if
   available. If not available, a larger runway with clearly identifiable LZ markings (IAW AFI
   13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations) may be used. One go-around is permitted,
   provided the aircraft does not touch down short of the zone (defined as the first 500 feet of
   useable runway).
       2.3.1.1. Pilots should accomplish the maximum effort takeoff and landing from the left
       seat (Exception: Instructor Pilots/Instructor Pilot candidates see paragraph 2.4).
       2.3.1.2. Pilots that only maintain an airland maximum effort qualification (non-airdrop)
       will fly an IFR or VFR high altitude route (minimum of 20 minutes long and 5000’ AGL)
       to a TOA at an airfield. The arrival will consist of either a high altitude tactical arrival or
       a penetration decent to a low altitude tactical arrival. The arrivals will be to a maximum
       effort landing.
   2.3.2. The airdrop profile will consist of a route (30 minute minimum from departure to
   TOT), SKE or visual formation procedures (if applicable), airdrop and recovery. The type of
   formation procedures will alternate for each periodic MSN evaluation. This does not
   preclude units from accomplishing both types of formation procedures on a MSN evaluation.
   The profile will be planned as a two-ship minimum. This does not preclude the completion of
   the evaluation as a single ship due to unforeseen circumstances.
       2.3.2.1. Element Lead Pilot. Accomplish the evaluation in the element lead position.
       2.3.2.2. Flight Lead Pilot. Accomplish the evaluation in the formation lead position.
       Examinee should participate in mission commander duties.
       2.3.2.3. DELETED
   2.3.3. For units/aircrew with a MSN evaluation requirement, Area 49 (Defensive
   Systems/Tactics) and Area 50 (Threat Avoidance) will be evaluated.
   2.3.4. (Added-403WG) 53 WRS Pilot (MSN WX) evaluations will be conducted during a
   MSN (Weather) evaluation. This evaluation may be conducted in conjunction with the
   INSTM/QUAL evaluation or any other flight profile except FCF or OCF missions. Evaluate
   knowledge of weather reconnaissance procedures according to the National Winter Storm
   Operations Plan (NWSOP), the National Hurricane Operations Plan (NHOP) and locally
   published weather procedures.
       2.3.4.1. (Added-403WG) Initial MSN evaluations will be accomplished in-flight on a
       weather overwater training mission, or actual tasked storm mission. The evaluation will
       be conducted as soon as possible after theater indoctrination. The next recurring MSN
       evaluation should be accomplished with the individual’s next INSTM/QUAL checkride
       to align the evaluations.
AFI11-2C-130JV2_403WGSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013                                                        13


           2.3.4.1.1. (Added-403WG) Weather mission procedures may be verbally evaluated
           during recurring MSN evaluations.
           2.3.4.1.2. (Added-403WG) Pilots who were mission qualified may be verbally
           evaluated on mission procedures during their initial aircraft commander evaluation.
2.4. Instructor Evaluations (Initial, Periodic, and Requalification). Flight examiners will
place particular emphasis on the examinee’s ability to recognize student difficulties and provide
timely and effective corrective action. Instructor pilots should be able to brief, observe, assess,
and debrief the student’s overall performance. State that instructional ability was evaluated in the
comments section of the AF IMT 8. List a minimum of two areas instructed by the examinee.
INIT or RQ INSTR evaluations will be conducted with a qualified pilot occupying the other seat.
For initial evaluation, the examinee will occupy the right seat; for recurring or RQs he/she may
occupy either seat.
   2.4.1. During periodic QUAL evaluations, instructors will initiate a simulated aircraft
   malfunction requiring a simulated engine shutdown, simulated engine-out approach and go-
   around. The instructor will be evaluated on his ability to ensure safe simulated engine-out
   operations.
   2.4.2. If airdrop qualified, all INIT and RQ INSTR evaluations require the examinee to
   instruct a SKE or visual low-level route and airdrop.
   2.4.3. All instructor areas/sub-areas must be evaluated.
2.5. Operational Mission Evaluation. Prior to Aircraft Commander certification, all pilots,
except those previously certified as Aircraft Commanders in Mobility Air Forces (MAF) C-130
or C-17 aircraft, will complete an Operational Mission Evaluation. Flight examiners will
evaluate the examinee’s ability to operate in command while performing the unit’s mission. The
flight should be an off-station operational or training mission. OG/CC may substitute a local
mission to preclude lengthy certification delays. Gaining MAJCOM Stan/Eval is the waiver
authority for this evaluation requirement. The evaluation will be documented as a “SPOT” and
the remarks section will include the following: “This evaluation was conducted in conjunction
with Aircraft Commander certification.”
2.6. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE).
   2.6.1. The INSTM/QUAL EPE will cover a cross section of aircraft systems knowledge and
   emergencies. All Boldface procedures will be evaluated. Examinees should demonstrate an
   understanding of aircraft systems beyond the actual steps required for an EP. Category I
   navigation procedures and Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD) knowledge will be evaluated.
   2.6.2. MSN EPEs will include knowledge of C-130J mission employment guidance, airdrop
   emergency procedures, tactics, threats, defensive system operation and the effect of degraded
   systems.
   2.6.3. (Added-403WG) Pilot EPEs will be conducted utilizing the approved 403 OGV Pilot
   EPE guides. AF Form 3862 (403 WG Overprint), Pilot Flight Evaluation Worksheet, will be
   used to annotate discrepancies and trend data. The 403 WG overprint for the AF Form 3862
   will be maintained by the 403 OGV office and is not part of this supplement, but will contain
   the contents of this supplement.
 14                                     AFI11-2C-130JV2_403WGSUP_I 30 AUGUST 2013


    2.6.4. (Added-403WG) Squadron schedulers should coordinate with DOV to ensure pilot
    EPEs are scheduled prior to the actual flight evaluation.

3.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic, and requalification evaluations,
including requirements for qualification, mission, and instructor evaluations.
3.2. Qualification Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Requalification). Qualification
evaluations will consist of aircraft preflight, loading of palletized cargo or rolling stock, in-flight
procedures, cargo offload, and aircraft postflight. If a periodic QUAL evaluation is combined
with a MSN evaluation, an airdrop platform/CDS can be used for evaluating the qualification
loading requirement. If a load is not available for a periodic evaluation, palletized, airdrop
platform, or vehicular cargo will be static loaded upon completion of the flight portion. All
General and Qualification areas/sub-areas are required qualification evaluation items. When in-
flight evaluation of Area 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 30, 31 and 32 are not possible, these areas
may be verbally evaluated.

   3.3.1. Initial and requalification (unqualified over two years) mission evaluations will
   consist of a mass CDS (minimum four containers) or sequential heavy equipment (HE) load.
   If a mass CDS or sequential HE load cannot be dropped for the evaluation, a single HE
   platform may be dropped provided sequential HE and mass CDS airdrop rigging was
   completed during training.
   3.3.2. Periodic and requalification (unqualified less then two years) mission evaluations will
   consist of a minimum of a single CDS container or single HE platform.
   3.3.3. The evaluator will not conduct two separate mission evaluations on the same flight
   with only one airdrop load aboard. An airdrop sortie and evaluation may be credited if an
   unplanned no-drop is called after completion of the Run-In checklist provided the no-drop
   was not due to loadmaster error. All General and Mission areas/sub-areas are required
   mission evaluation items.
   3.3.4. Document initial personnel and heavy equipment restriction when an actual personnel
   or heavy equipment airdrop is not completed during initial mission training on AF IMT 8.

                               NAVIGATOR EVALUATIONS

5.1. (Added-403WG) General. This chapter provides flight examiners, instructors, and
aircrews with local procedures and WC-130J/C-130J evaluation criteria/tolerances to be used
during the administration of flight evaluations. Evaluators will use the guidance in AFI11-2C-
130J, C-130J Aircrew Evaluation Criteria, supplemented by applicable guidance in this
document. The 403 WG overprint for the AF Form 3862 will be maintained by the 403 OGV
office and is not part of this supplement, but will contain the contents of this supplement.
5.2. (Added-403WG) Applicability. This supplement applies to aircrew personnel assigned
and attached to the 403d Wing. Copies should be made available to all 403d Wing aircrew
members operating the WC-130J and C-130J.

   5.4.1. (Added-403WG) Evaluations will be administered on a Category I route or a
   Category II route using Category I navigation procedures. The basic navigation sortie will be
   of adequate scope and duration to perform all procedures and mission tasks normally
   encountered on a Category I overwater mission. The tropical cyclone reconnaissance mission
   for navigators requires a certification and not a qualification (storm certification). This
   certification is accomplished after the initial mission qualification, and does not require a
   separate checkride. Mission evaluations require a profile simulating a winter or tropical
   storm to include in-flight fuel management and weather radar. Storm certified navigators will
   at a minimum be verbally evaluated on Alpha patterns, and on-time criteria. Mission
   qualification may be accomplished on a weather overwater training mission or actual tasked
   storm mission.
5.5. (Added-403WG) Instructor Evaluations (Initial, Periodic, and Requalification). All
instructor areas/sub-areas are required instructor evaluation areas. Flight examiners will place
particular emphasis on the examinee’s ability to recognize student difficulties, provide timely
and effective corrective action, and brief, observe, assess, and debrief the student’s overall
performance including CRM. State that instructional abilities were evaluated in the comments
section of the AF Form 8. List a minimum of two areas instructed by the examinee.
5.6. (Added-403WG) Emergency Procedures Evaluation. An EPE is required for all initial,
requalification, and recurring qualification and mission evaluations. Do not conduct EPEs during
or immediately before a flight evaluation. EPEs should be scenario driven with an emphasis on
emergency procedures and systems knowledge relative to the evaluation type. Boldface
procedures are required to be evaluated for each EPE and other areas/sub-areas evaluated are
determined by the OGV developed EPE scenario selected by the evaluator. Examinees may use
