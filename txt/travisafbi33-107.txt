    (BRAG) meetings as required by AFI 63-124.

11. LMR System Security:
    11.1. LMR systems are considered “radio-telephone communications’ and are not secure. Radio
    transmissions are no more secure than ordinary telephone communications. Even though these sys-
    tems are short range, line-of-sight communications, security is just as vital as that required for long
    distance radio-telephone communications. In the interest of security, transmissions will be as brief as
    possible, consistent with clarity. All personnel must be on guard to the fact that transmissions are sub-
    ject to enemy interception and thus have no security. Any variations from established procedures are
    not allowed because they will often cause confusion, reduce reliability and speed, and tend to negate
    security precautions.
    11.2. Users will observe all OPSEC and transmission security policies when use in any type of PWCS
    systems.

12. Initial Procurement/Increase of PWCS Equipment:
    12.1. PWCS equipment is authorized only if mission essential requirements cannot be met by tele-
    phone or existing communications facilities.
    12.2. For PWCS equipment requests, the unit PWCS manager must submit a completed PWCS
    request package, with required routing and signatures, to base PWCS manager. The base PWCS man-
    ager will provide technical assistance upon request.
    12.3. Upon gaining appropriate approval for equipment procurement; the base PWCS manager will
    provide assistance in determining the best method of procurement. Disapproved requests will be
    returned to the originator without further action.

13. Replacement of PWCS Equipment:
    13.1. Equipment to be replaced must fall under one of four categories.
       13.1.1. Requests for equipment scheduled for replacement under the five-year replacement plan
       will be validated by the base PWCS manager.
       13.1.2. Requests for replacement of equipment damaged beyond economical repair (exceeds 75
       percent of replacement cost) must include letter of authorization from the owning units com-
       mander.
TRAVISAFBI33-107 15 APRIL 2002                                                                      5


      13.1.3. Request for replacement of individual equipment items, which no longer fulfill user’s
      needs, must be approved by the 60 CS/CC.
      13.1.4. Requests for replacement of lost equipment items must be accompanied by some form of
      approval from the owning units commander (i.e., report of survey, letter of authorization).

14. Requests for Frequencies:
   14.1. In order to conserve the frequency spectrum, frequencies should be shared whenever possible.
   14.2. If a new frequency is required; the operating agency will coordinate with the base spectrum
   manager (60 CS/SCXR), and provide necessary information for frequency request in standard mes-
   sage format.

15. Equipment Malfunctions:
   15.1. Unit PWCS manager will notify the base PWCS manager of the outage. The following informa-
   tion is required:
      15.1.1. Type of equipment (base station, console, etc.).
      15.1.2. Location (building, room number, vehicle location).
      15.1.3. Description of malfunction.
      15.1.4. Name and telephone number of point of contact.
   15.2. Outages of portable equipment (i.e., hand-held radios, cellular phones, and pagers) will be
   brought to the base PWCS manager for repair or replacement.

16. Safety:
   16.1. General policy: AFOSH Standard 48-9 establishes an electromagnetic radiation safety standard
   that applies to radio equipment. The following are recommended:
      16.1.1. DO NOT allow antenna to touch exposed parts of the body, especially face or eyes, while
