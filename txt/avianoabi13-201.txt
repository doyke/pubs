SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction incorporates changes made within the revised AFI 13-213 . Restricted area
boundaries and entry control points were defined and indicated in the airfield diagram. The new
Controlled Movement Area (CMA) boundaries were modified to meet International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards. The VFR hold lines were relocated to match the new
CMA. ―Flightline Driving Program‖ was changed to ―Airfield Driving Program‖ and ―Flightline
Driving Program Managers (FDPM) was changed to ―Airfield Driving Program Managers
(ADPM). Runway intrusion was identified as runway incursion. The Wing Commander is now

   2.3.2. Vehicles will be operated single-file on traffic lanes at all times unless in direct
   support of an aircraft or responding to an emergency (see Attachment 3).
   2.3.3. Prior to entering a taxiway or ramp area from any airfield entrance or unpaved surface,
   and prior to driving over FOD shaker devices, all vehicle operators will conduct a roll-over
   FOD Check. Vehicles will be checked by the driver and/or vehicle occupants for foreign
   objects in the tire treads. For a roll-over FOD Check, all portions of vehicle tires must be
   carefully inspected by pulling forward after initial check of visible tire area to inspect the
   remaining tire area. The vehicle must be turned off anytime the driver’s seat is unoccupied,
   i.e. during roll-over FOD checks. If debris is carried onto the airfield, the driver will stop the
   vehicle and pick up all debris before departing the area.
   2.3.4. Normal traffic will yield to emergency vehicles by stopping on the right side of the
   taxiways or by pulling onto other hard surfaces off the taxiway. If it is necessary to drive off
   the paved surface, the operator is responsible for checking the vehicle tires for any FOD
   material and ensuring all tires and the paved surface are clear of FOD. This check will be
   accomplished immediately upon returning to the paved surface.
2.4. Ramp Conditions.
   2.4.1. When fog conditions are prevalent and the visibility on the ramps and taxiways is
   reduced, the Weather Flight (31 OSS/OSW) will notify the Airfield Management Operations
