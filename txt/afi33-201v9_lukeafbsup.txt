SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been revised and needs to be reviewed. The primary change to this

KSV-21. Updates paragraphs 1.3.4.4.1. and 1.3.7.1. Updates attachments numbering sequence.
1.3.4.1.1. (Added) C4 Systems Requirements Document (LUKEAFB 3215) must be
coordinated through the wing Communications Security (COMSEC) Manager, 56 CS/SCXS.
1.3.4.1.2. (Added) Contact 56 CS/SCX with any line requirement (i.e., phone jack installed,
moved, etc.).
1.3.4.4.1. (Added) Establish and conduct initial and refresher secure voice device user training
utilizing Attachment 15. Document training (Attachment 16) and forward a copy to 56
CS/SCXS.
1.3.4.7.1. (Added) Annual CIK inventory will be accomplished during the month of January.
Use the example shown in Attachment 17. Forward a copy to the 56 CS/SCXS, User
Representative (UR).

      SECURE VOICE RESPONSIBLE OFFICER (SVRO) AND USER TRAINING

A15.1. Secure Voice Responsible Officer (SVRO) Training. The SVRO must receive training
on their responsibilities pertaining to secure voice user training, annual CIK/KSV-21 inventory,
and any other responsibilities prescribed by the COMSEC manager.
A15.2. User Training. The SVRO will train each user they support. This training must include
responsibilities pertaining to secure voice devices, protection of CIK/KSV-21, physical security
requirements for the equipment, and any other responsibilities prescribed by the COMSEC
manager.
A15.3. Placing Unclassified Calls: When the secure voice device is in the un-keyed mode, use it
only for placing unclassified calls. Removing the CIK/KSV-21 makes the terminal un-keyed.
A15.4. Placing Classified Calls: When the secure voice device terminal is in the keyed mode
(CIK/KSV-21 inserted) afford protection commensurate with the classification level of the key.
When unauthorized personnel are in the area, keep the keyed secure voice device under the
operational control and within the view of only appropriately cleared personnel.
A15.5. Authentication Display. Pay strict attention to the authentication display, to ensure the
classification level of the conversation does not exceed the highest classification displayed.
A15.6. Expired Key. To ensure the distant end does not have an expired key, scroll as soon as
you go secure to the "expiration date." If the key is expired, do not discuss classified
information and notify the individual accordingly.
A15.7. Discussing Classified Information. Before discussing classified information, the person
making the classified call must verify all personnel in the area are cleared and have a need to
know.
A15.8. Re-keying the secure voice device. Each Secure Voice Device user must call the
Electronic Key Management System Central Facility (EKMS CF) (1-800-635-6301) once each
year to re-key their device. We require you document the re-key date and file the verification
(MFR format) in the unit’s SVRO binder.
A15.9. Storing the CIK/KSV-21. If a secure voice device not operational 24 hours a day, the
CIK/ KSV-21 must be removed at the close of business. Place this action on the end of the day
security checklist (SF-701). Store the CIK/KSV-21 in a GSA-approved security container (if
kept in the same room as the secure voice device). If the secure voice device is used in an
"authorized for open storage" facility, the CIK/KSV-21 may remain in the phone.
A15.10. Reportable COMSEC Incidents. The following are reportable COMSEC incidents that
you must report to the COMSEC manager:
A15.10.1. CIK/KSV-21 left in Secure Voice Device overnight (except 24-hour work centers or
areas approved for open storage of classified material).
A15.10.2. Lost secure voice device.
A15.10.3. Lost seed/operational key/KSV-21 associated cards.
A15.10.4. Unauthorized user making a secure call on a secure voice device.
AFI33-201V9_LUKEAFBSUP 31 DECEMBER 2013                                                       5


A15.10.5. Secure call completed using expired key.
A15.10.6. Any instance where the authentication information displayed during a secure call is
not representative of the distant device.
A15.10.7. Failure to adequately protect or to erase a CIK/KSV-21 associated with a lost
terminal.
A15.10.8. Any instance where the display indicates the distant terminal contains compromised
key.
A15.10.9. Keyed Secure Voice Device (CIK/KSV-21 inserted) left unattended (i.e., no
authorized user present for more than 5 minutes). Exceptions to this are rooms with open storage
authorization.
A15.10.10. Any instance where the display is inoperative and a secure call is completed.
A15.11. Emergency Procedures. In the event of fire, natural disaster, or covert threat, remove
the CIK/KSV-21 from the secure voice device and secure it.
