SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It supersedes
all previous 18 WG publications concerning the 18 WG Orientation Flight Program. Major
changes include: removing all references to Incentive flights as current and forecast budget
constraints have forced HQ USAF to disallow these types of flights; establishes the 18th
Operations Group Director of Staff (18 OG/DS) as the OPR to prioritize and manage the 18 WG
Orientation Flight program; adds to the list of individuals that can expect 18th Wing Commander
(18 WG/CC) approval for Familiarization flights on 18 WG aircraft; updates Orientation Flight
Approval Letter (Attachment 3).
1. 18th Wing Orientation Flight Program. Orientation flights are defined as continuous
flights in DoD-owned aircraft performed within the local flying area and terminating at the point
of origin. The USAF Orientation program consists of Incentive, Familiarization, Distinguished
Visitor, and Spouse flights and may be conducted to provide a better understanding of PACAF
weapon systems and missions.
     1.1. Refer to AFI 11-401, Table 1.1., to determine Orientation flight eligibility, approval
     level, and associated lead times for obtaining approval.
     1.2. Refer to Attachment 5 of AFI 11-401_PACAFSUP for detailed requirements of all
     Orientation flights. It is imperative all organizations, especially the squadron providing the
     flight, know and follow its stipulations.
     1.3. Due to current and forecast budget constraints, the 18 OG will not offer Incentive flights
     until higher-headquarters (HHQ) guidance changes, at which time this document will be
     modified.
     1.4. Each 18 WG Group is required to provide a point of contact (POC) responsible for
     coordination with the 18 OG/DS.
     1.5. Flying squadrons may be tasked to provide POCs responsible for particular missions.
2. Orientation Flight Responsibilities.
     2.1. 18 WG Group POCs. These POCs will receive initial requests for Orientation flights
     from their respective Groups. They will in turn work closely with the 18 OG/DS during the
     concept stage of any planned mission in order to answer any questions or facilitate any
     requests. In any event, the 18 OG/DS should be contacted no later than 45 days prior to the
     mission.
     2.2. 18 OG Director of Staff (18 OG/DS). This individual retains overall supervision and
     is responsible for managing the 18 WG Orientation Flight Program. The 18 OG/DS will
     typically delegate management of Orientation flights to the flying squadron that provides the
     aircraft for the mission.
        2.2.1. 18 OG/DS will coordinate Orientation Flight Approval Documentation, which
        may be in any form that the 18 WG/CC authorizes. A completed copy of the
        documentation will be supplied to the flying unit administering the Orientation flight.
        The Orientation Flight Approval Letter (Attachment 3) is an example of proper
        documentation. Approval documentation is not required for those Familiarization flight
        recipients stipulated in Sections 3.1 and 3.2
KADENAABI11-401 24 JULY 2014                                                                  3


     2.2.2. After receiving individual names from the 18 WG Group POCs, the 18 OG/DS
     will assign missions to the respective flying squadron.
     2.2.3. 18 OG/DS will provide the 18 WG/CC with a quarterly list of Orientation flight
     recipients by name. This list should also include the squadron providing the flight.
     These lists are due to the 18 WG/CC not later than (NLT) the 5th day January, April, July
     and October for the respective preceding quarter.
  2.3. 18th Medical Group/Chief of Aerospace Medicine (18 MDG/SGP) will notify the 18
  OG/DS, and the flying squadron assigned the mission (when known), if the individual is not
  physically qualified to perform the flight, and whether this disqualification is temporary or
  permanent.
  2.4. Squadrons Conducting Orientation Flights. Squadron commanders or directors of
  operations must approve the Orientation flight and the mission’s profile. They will also
  ensure compliance with all command restrictions for carrying passengers.
     2.4.1. Squadrons are responsible for developing an Operations Group Standards and
     Evaluations (OGV)-approved Orientation Flight Checklist for their particular Mission
     Design Series (MDS). This checklist must be reviewed and signed-off by the
     Familiarization flight pilot prior to the actual flight.
     2.4.2. Upon receiving names from the 18 OG/DS, squadrons will coordinate with the
     18th Medical Group Flight & Operational Medicine Clinic (FOMC) for physical exams
     (if necessary), and coordinate directly with the selected individual.
     2.4.3. Notify Orientation recipients of the following: proposed date of flight; flying
     squadron providing the sortie; and if necessary, times for flight surgeon screening, egress
     training, equipment fitting, and any other prerequisite training.
  2.5. Requisite Training. All Orientation flight passengers will receive appropriate life
  support, egress, Emergency Parachute Training (EPT), water survival familiarization and
  emergency procedures training for the appropriate airframe in accordance with AFI 11-301,
  Volume 1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program, and Para A5.4.7, AFI 11-
  401_PACAFSUP, Aviation Management.
  2.6. Orientation Flight Recipients. The individual is responsible for ensuring all
  requirements for the Orientation flight are met. See Attachment 4 for Orientation Flight
  Training Accomplishment Checklist. After completion, return this checklist to the applicable
  squadron’s operations desk NLT 1 hour prior to stepping to the aircraft for the
  Familiarization flight.
     2.6.1. Orientation flight recipients assigned to the 18 WG. These individuals are
     required to notify their supervisor of the flight date and to schedule time-off from their
     primary duty to accomplish any prerequisite training.
     2.6.2. Orientation flight recipients not assigned to the 18 WG. An 18 WG point of
     contact will normally be assigned the responsibility of rendering assistance and ensuring
     the individual attains all necessary training and clearances. This individual (POC) will
     typically be assigned to the squadron that is providing the flight.
 4                                                         KADENAABI11-401 24 JULY 2014


     2.7. Record Keeping. Both the 18 OG/DS and the individual flying squadrons will
     maintain records associated with Orientation flights for one year for historical tracking
     purposes. Required data only includes name and date of flight.
     2.8. Orientation Flights in Non-Fighter Aircraft.             In accordance with AFI 11-
     401_PACAFSUP, Attachment 5, candidates flying in Non-Ejection seat aircraft must fill out
     the Sample Health Statement for Orientation Flight on Non-Ejection Seat Aircraft
     (Attachment 5 of this instruction) within 14 days of the flight.
     2.9. Orientation Flights in Fighter Aircraft.
        2.9.1. Medical Clearance. In accordance with AFI 11-401_PACAFSUP, candidates
        flying in fighter aircraft without a current AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendations for
        Flying or Special Operational Duty, must receive a medical evaluation and current AF
        Form 1042 from a flight surgeon between 14 days and 72 hours prior to the flight.
            2.9.1.1. Individuals either not on current aeronautical orders and/or not possessing a
            current flight physical will be examined/briefed by a USAF flight surgeon.
            2.9.1.2. Further instructions for both civilian and military candidates flying in
            ejection seat aircraft are found in AFI 48-123, paragraph 6.24.5.1.
        2.9.2. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Training. Squadron AFE Officers will
        provide F-15 egress training, and Survival, Evasion, Resistance & Escape (SERE) will
        provide EPT and water survival familiarization training within 72 hours of the flight.
        AFE will provide equipment familiarization and fitting within 72 hours of the flight.
        2.9.3. Passenger Briefing. See Attachment 2 for required briefing items.
3. Familiarization Flights. Familiarization flights are an important tool for providing
individuals with a first-hand look at 18 WG and PACAF missions. Commanders should use
these flights for active duty military members and other eligible individuals listed in AFI11-
401_PACAFSUP. Familiarization flights will be flown using normal training profiles and on a
non-interference basis for the specific weapons system. Squadron commanders of the unit
providing the flight will determine what constitutes interference with unit training. Table 1.1.
(PACAF), Line 12A of AFI11-401_PACAFSUP allows the 18 WG/CC to approve Orientation
Flights for “Active Duty and Reserve Component military (O-6 and below) and DoD civilian
equivalents (unless they are in suspended or duty not involving flying [DNIF] status).” This
delegation to the WG/CC does not apply when aircraft are “chopped” or assigned to a gaining
Combatant Commander. The following sections identify those personnel who are granted
automatic WG/CC approval for Familiarization flights. Individuals in Section 3.1 will have
priority over those in Section 3.2
     3.1. The following individuals have automatic 18 WG/CC approval in any 18 WG
     aircraft, and in the following order of priority:
        3.1.1. 18 WG, 18 AEW, and 353 SOG aircrew on aeronautical orders.
            3.1.1.1. 18 AEW aircrew will typically include, but will not be limited to the aircrew
            of those USAF squadrons operating from Kadena AB as part of HHQ tasking (e.g. 82
            ERS, 390 IS, 5 EAACS, and any USAF fighter deployment to Kadena AB).
KADENAABI11-401 24 JULY 2014                                                                    5


          3.1.1.2. Aircrew specialties will only observe missions utilizing operations in their
          area of expertise (e.g., boom operators should observe missions conducting air
          refueling operations).
       3.1.2. 623 ACF Weapons Directors and Air Weapons Officers.
       3.1.3. MACS-4 Controllers.
       3.1.4. 18 AMDS/SGPT platform instructors on aeronautical orders.
       3.1.5. Officers awaiting pilot training.
   3.2. The following individuals have automatic 18 WG/CC approval for a maximum of
   one (1) Familiarization flight in any 18 WG aircraft, and in the following order of
   priority:
       3.2.1. All 18 WG and Team Kadena unit commanders.
       3.2.2. All 18 MXG members for their respective/supported MDS’s (e.g., an F-15
       maintainer can fly in an F-15, but not in a HH-60). 18 MXG personnel who work on
       multiple MDS’s (e.g. those who work in backshop locations) are allowed their one
       allocated flight in any one of the MDS’s they support.
       3.2.3. All 18 OG and 18 AEW personnel who are not on aeronautical orders.
4. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Flights. DV flights require higher headquarters approval & will
be coordinated through 18th Operational Support Squadron/Current Operations (18 OSS/OSO).
Normally, an 18 WG or squadron POC will be appointed. Spare aircraft should be coordinated.
In all cases, the 18th Operations Group Commander (18 OG/CC) will be advised of mission
details to include: Profile; step, take-off, landing times, and flight lineup.
5. Spouse Orientation Flight Program. Approval to accomplish Spouse Orientation flights is
delegated to the 18 WG/CC in accordance with AFI11-401_PACAFSUP. Spouse Orientation
programs should include the wing command briefing, mission briefing, flight, and debriefing.
Spouse orientation flights will be accomplished in accordance with AFI11-401, Aviation
Management.
   5.1. Spouse Orientation flights will be conducted in non-fighter aircraft only.
   5.2. The flying squadron providing the flight will designate a project officer for coordination
   and control of Spouse Orientation flights. An escort officer will accompany spouses at all
   times. This escort officer will not be a primary crewmember on the mission.
   5.3. Spouses are not permitted to fly the aircraft. In addition, spouses are not permitted to
   fly on the same aircraft when another family member is a crewmember.
   5.4. Any unit wishing to conduct Spouse Orientation flights will coordinate with 18 OG/DS.
 6                                                     KADENAABI11-401 24 JULY 2014



6. Spouse Taxi-Ride Program. Aircraft (including fighter aircraft) not appropriate for Spouse
Orientation flights may be used in a spouse taxi-ride program in accordance with AFI11-
401_PACAFSUP, Section A5.5.
