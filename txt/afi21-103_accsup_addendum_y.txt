This MESL compliments AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting. It
applies to all U-2S/TU-2S ACC units. This Addendum does not apply to Air National Guard
(ANG) or Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units and members. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this document are maintained in accordance with
Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance
with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS). Contact supporting records managers as required. Send recommended changes
or comments on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to HQ ACC/A4C,

applicable OCR. This publication may not be supplemented.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This addendum
provides better alignment of the Basic Systems Listings (BSL) with current mission types and
will help improve the accuracy of aircraft status reporting by updating the system listing and
qualifying notes.

1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the ground
work for reporting the status of aircraft, and in the case of the U-2S weapon system, sensor, data
links and Electronic Warfare systems (hereafter referred to as Mission Systems) capabilities.
The MESL also lists the minimum essential systems and subsystems that are required for flight
based on mission type. Aircraft and Mission System status is determined by maintenance
technicians using applicable system technical orders. The ability to fly an aircraft with
inoperative systems is a risk management decision that must be evaluated by both aircrew and
maintenance subject matter experts and unit command. This MESL shall be used by both
maintenance personnel and aircrew.
     1.1. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness SORTS reporting only and
     denotes Mission Capable (MC) aircraft capable of being configured for a contingency
     mission in accordance with COMACC OMNIBUS Plan.
     1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
     Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC.
     A Non-Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and
     can be configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
     1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Upon actual
     deployment to another MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to
     resource and specify the unit's requirements and resource the differences in support/mission
     equipment.
2. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the system or subsystem stated by work
unit code (WUC) against the Full System List (FSL) and all applicable Basic System Lists (BSL)
across the page. Applicability of BSL columns is determined by mission requirements and
mission specific directives. Note: the Reconnaissance Tactical and Reconnaissance Strategic
columns have been deleted from the U-2 MESL and replaced with Operational Reconnaissance.
For purposes of this instruction, Reconnaissance in Support of Nuclear Operations (RISNO) and
Emergency War Order (EWO) missions are considered operational.
     2.1. The U-2 has three basic mission types: operational, training, and survival launch.
     Operational sorties have the most complicated system degradation acceptability tolerances.
     Training sorties should accept the least risk in system degradation in order to accomplish
     training requirements. Survival launch missions will accept the most risk with degraded
     systems to save the weapon system from serious threat. Survival launch missions operate at
     the discretion of the WG/CC.
     2.2. The U-2 aircraft and Mission Systems are uploaded and downloaded by military and
     contractor maintenance personnel. Mission Systems have an Equipment ID with an SRD
     (Standard Reporting Designator) that is status reportable. Mission System Status will be
     reported whether the capability is loaded on an Aircraft or not. Aircraft undergoing sensor,
     data link, or EWS configuration changes may be reported as FMC unless a discrepancy exists
     affecting the condition of a system as indicated below. If a discrepancy exists, both the
     Aircraft and Mission System Status shall be reported appropriately.
     2.3. The U-2 may be FMC with sub-systems and/or Mission Systems inoperative. The U-2
     is NMC if an item marked in the applicable BSL is completely inoperative. PMC status is
     applicable when the U-2 is still capable of conducting some portion of a mission, but not all
AFI21-103_ACCSUP_ADDENDUM_Y 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                         3


   systems operate (i.e., AN/ASQ-230 inoperative on an imagery mission, or a single MFD
   inoperative). If an aircraft is configured for a system, assign aircraft status whether system is
   installed or not. Do not measure against aircraft that are not configured for system
   installation.
   2.4. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain degraded
   mission systems.
   2.5. U-2 flight authority for inoperative equipment not listed in this AFI supplement is the
   OG/CC. and will not be delegated lower than a flying squadron operations officer.
   2.6. All Mission System malfunctions impacting sensor collection shall be documented in
   IMDS during post-flight maintenance debrief. Mission System malfunctions resulting in an
   inoperative system will have the status updated appropriately. This is critical given the
   distributed nature of the U-2 mission system.

9     System must be able to complete at least 80% of collection plan and any degradation must
      not prohibit image exploitation. System may be PMC if able to collect greater than 80%
      but is not FMC. System must be able to forward processed results to Data Link system.

     must be able to pass PME-2 data to the Data Link system. PME-1 system must be able to
     initialize, load, and maintain ATM communications. PME-2 system must not have
     complete loss of Direction Find or Pulse Measurement Capability. System may be PMC
     with partial degradation in these areas. System must be able to forward processed results to
     Data Link system.
13   System must be able to link with appropriate relay or ground site for at least 80% of
     required on-station time. System may be PMC when able to link for greater than 80% but
