1. General.
     1.1. Compliance and Standardization Requirements Lists (C&SRL) are the primary lists
     used during the HQ ACC/IG Unit Compliance Inspections (UCI) to assess unit compliance
     with established guidance governing each particular area of operations. Items defined in this
     C&SRL are defined by the ACC staff and based upon existing “by-law” requirements,
     Executive Orders, Department of Defense (DoD) directives, AF and ACC guidance, and
     mission areas deemed critical by AF or ACC leadership to assess and assure unit
     organizational health and/or performance. The objective of the C&SRL is to identify
     deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities.
     1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCO) represent the highest priority of inspection items
     and are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCA) and the
     14 missions areas defined in AFI 90-201. Lower tier Core and General Compliance Items
     may be stand alone or subordinate to a CCO. During the UCI, it is the intent of the ACC/IG
     to inspect, as a minimum, 100% of the CCOs that apply to the inspected unit. However,
     C&SRL items listed do not limit the scope of the inspection. Critical, core and general
     compliance criteria are defined as follows:
        1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective. An item where a unit failure to comply with
        established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or serious injury or
        significant mission impact. Key mission areas are:
        - Airman development programs
        - Ability to deploy forces
        - Ability to employ forces
        CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.
        1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). An item or area that requires special vigilance
        and is important to the overall performance of the unit, but are is deemed "Critical."
        Non-compliance would result in some negative impact on mission performance or could
        result in injury or possible litigations. CCIs are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT.
        1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). An item or area deemed fundamental to
        successful overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal
        impact on mission accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible
        litigation. GCIs are shown in sentence case format.
