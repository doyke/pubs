                                           Chapter 1

                 1. TYPES OF PUBLIC ADDRESS SUPPORT AVAILABLE

1.1. The 355th Communications Squadron (355 CS) provides the following levels of PA
support to DMAFB organizations for official functions. Official functions defined in this
instruction, for the purposes of PA support, are military ceremonies and other base sanctioned
events that are free and open to the base populace and do not violate any applicable laws,
directives, or policies. This support is intended to provide the capability of addressing large
audiences and broadcasting official music required for military ceremonies. PA support is not
intended for broadcasting music for morale purposes and 355 CS PA support personnel will not
function as “disc jockeys” during any activities. 355 CS PA support personnel will determine
exactly what equipment is provided and in what configuration based on the requirements of the
requesting unit.
     1.1.1. Full PA support, consisting of the items in the sub-paragraphs below, is provided to
     DMAFB organizations for official base functions. Some examples include, but are not
     limited to: organizational change of command ceremonies, commander’s calls at the group
     level or above, retirement ceremonies for military members O-6 and above or E-9, and
     DMAFB “very important person” (VIP) visits sponsored by 12th Air Force (12 AF) or 355th
     Fighter Wing (355 FW).
        1.1.1.1. Transportation, setup, operation, and tear down of all necessary wireless and
        wired microphones, speakers, compact disc players, and related PA equipment required
        to address large audiences in attendance of official military functions.
        1.1.1.2. Official ceremonial music recorded on compact discs. Examples of music
        provided are: The Star Spangled Banner, Air Force Song, Ruffles and Flourishes, and
        The General’s March.
        1.1.1.3. Due to limited manning and other mission requirements, 355 CS does not
        provide full PA support for practices of official functions that justify full PA support;
        unless supporting 12 AF, Wing, or Group level functions. Exceptions must be approved
        by 355th Communications Squadron Commander (355 CS/CC).
     1.1.2. Limited PA support, consisting of the items in the sub-paragraphs below, is provided
     to DMAFB organizations for official functions that are not covered in paragraph 1.1.1.
     Some examples include, but are not limited to, squadron commander’s calls, retirement
     ceremonies for military members O-5 and below or E-8 and below, and practices for official
     functions listed in paragraph 1.1.1. In addition, other base sponsored, “free entry” events
     may be supported on a non-mission interference basis. Some examples include, but are not
     limited to, the Special Olympics and Heritage Festivals.
        1.1.2.1. Sign out of portable public address systems that include wireless microphones,
        speakers, and compact disk player.
        1.1.2.2. Official ceremonial music recorded on compact discs. Examples of music
        provided are: The Star Spangled Banner, Air Force Song, Ruffles and Flourishes, and
        The General’s March.

1.2. PA support is provided only within the boundaries of DMAFB due to possible legal
conflicts with local unions. Exceptions must be approved by 355 CS/CC and 355th Fighter
Wing/Staff Judge Advocate (355 FW/JA).
1.3. PA support is not provided for functions held within facilities with permanently
installed PA equipment (e. g. Base Theater, Enlisted Club, Officer’s Club). The 355 CS Radio
Frequency (RF) Transmission Systems work center can assist base organizations requiring use of
PA systems within facilities listed above with instructions on how to request and obtain use of
these systems.
1.4. 355 CS provided PA equipment may not be patched with outside audio/visual
equipment with the exception of providing news media output audio feeds from base level
events that the 355 CS is supporting with PA equipment. This prohibition is to prevent
outside equipment from potentially causing damage to Air Force equipment through signal or
impedance mismatching, in addition, prevents possible copyright violations.
1.5. 355 CS does not provide music other than stated in paragraphs 1.
   1.1.2. and 1.
   1.2.2. Copyrighted music may be used with 355 CS PA equipment, but with the following
   restrictions: music must be on the originally purchased media source (e.g. compact disk),
   ceremony must be free to attend, and music must not reflect negatively on the Air Force, be
   contrary to good order and discipline, or generally be considered inappropriate at a military
   ceremony. 355 FW Public Affairs and/or 355 FW/JA should be consulted for clarification on
   what type of music would fall into these categories.
1.6. 355 CS PA support personnel shall rescind PA support at their discretion under the
following conditions, which shall be considered on a case-by-case basis:
   1.6.1. Inclement weather, to include but not limited to, rain, lightning, strong winds and
   snow that could result in damages to 355 CS PA support equipment. The 355 CS RF
   Transmission Systems personnel operating the PA equipment during the supported event are
   responsible for safeguarding these Air Force equipment assets, ensuring that there are no
   damages inflicted by adverse weather. If damage to equipment is likely to result from
   continued operation, these personnel shall immediately take measures to protect PA support
   equipment, unless directed otherwise by the 355th Communications Squadron Commander
   (355 CS/CC).
   1.6.2. Damage has been caused or high probability of damage is likely to result due to unsafe
   and/or improper usage of the PA equipment by the supported unit. This includes making
   adjustments to PA equipment without 355 CS personnel authorization (e.g. moving speakers,
   adjusting audio settings) or mistreatment of equipment that could result in damages.

                                          Chapter 2

                              2. REQUESTING PA SUPPORT

2.1. DMAFB units can request PA support from 355 CS by the following means:
     2.1.1. 355 CS maintains a PA Support SharePoint website with a PA Support Request web
     form that sends email notification to 355 CS Public Address Support personnel when
     submitted. The PA Support web form can be found by visiting the CS Customer Support
     SharePoint                                                                        site
     (https://dm.eim.acc.af.mil/355MSG/355CS/CustomerSupport/default.aspx) and then
     clicking “PA Request Form.”
     2.1.2. In the event the CS SharePoint is non-functional, requests may be initiated by e-
     mailing the request to the 355 CS PA Support group e-mail listing
     (355cs.PASupport@dm.af.mil)
2.2. 355 CS RF Transmission Systems personnel will initiate PA Support coordination with
the requesting unit within 2 duty days from receipt of web form request or email request.
2.3. Requests for PA Support that fall into the scope of paragraph 1
1.1. must be made at least 10 duty days prior to the date the support is required. This lead
time is required to schedule manpower, equipment, and other mission requirements around the
requested support. If a request is made within 10 duty days of the required support date, the
requesting organization’s commander must e-mail their endorsement of the short-notice PA
support request to 355 CS Public Address Support e-mail listed in paragraph 2.1.2.
2.4. Requests for PA Support that fall into the scope of paragraph 1
1.2. are prioritized on a “first-come, first-served” basis. Therefore, requests should be made
with as much lead time as possible.
2.5. PA personnel will typically be dressed in the Airman Battle Uniform (ABUs) when
operating PA equipment at ceremonies. If requesting units require PA support personnel to be
dressed in a service dress uniform, additional setup/prep time will be required for personnel to
change uniforms.

                       3. REQUESTING UNIT RESPONSIBILITIES

3.1. Any organization or person requesting PA support on DMAFB is responsible for
complying with the provisions of this instruction.
3.2. When requesting PA support for events that fall under the scope of paragraph 1
1.1. and the ceremony includes a meal, the requesting organization must provide a meal
for the required PA support personnel in attendance.
3.3. When operating a portable PA system loaned from 355 CS, requesting organizations
are required to observe and adhere to provisions listed in paragraph 1 5. to ensure
applicable copyright laws and directives are adhered to. Failure to comply with this provision
could subject personnel to possible civil fines and/or administrative disciplinary action.
3.4. When signing out portable PA systems from 355 CS, requesting organizations will be
responsible for safeguarding PA equipment from theft and damage in addition to adhering
to restrictions in paragraph 1 4. If PA equipment is damaged while under the care of a
requesting organization, that organization is responsible for reimbursing 355 CS for the repair or
replacement costs of the damaged PA equipment.
