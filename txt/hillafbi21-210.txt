1. Hill AFB Explosive Clear Zone (ECZ). The ECZ consists of the Hill AFB Munitions
Storage Area (MSA) (comprised of Missile and Munitions Storage (MAMS) I and II areas) and
other sited explosives storage and operations areas on Hill AFB as well as Utah Test and
Training Range (UTTR), Little Mountain, and the 649 Munitions Squadron (MUNS)
Detachment 1 Lackland Air Force Base Annex, LAFB. The ECZ serves numerous Air Force
needs such as munitions storage, missile storage, bomb build-up, missile maintenance,
propellant/munitions testing, demolition and contingency operations. The ECZ on Hill AFB is
truly unique and one of a kind within the Air Force in terms of its varied missions and support to

numerous independent missions. The purpose of this instruction and the ECZ Master Plan is to
ensure regulatory compliance and a level of standardization necessary to successfully meet and
exceed the mission requirements of each supported organization.
2. ECZ Program Management.
     2.1. Purpose. To effectively meet the multi-organizational mission requirements of all ECZ
     users, it is essential the unique and critical ECZ resources be used in the most efficient means
     possible. The future of the ECZ and Hill AFB are closely intertwined. Their progression
     through the 21st century must be planned and strategically mapped with innovation and
     excellence. Every opportunity to integrate operations and enhance capabilities while meeting
     Air Force munitions infrastructure strategic goals are assessed and capitalized upon. As a
     critical resource shared by multiple organizations with independent missions, the Hill’s ECZ
     poses unique challenges in inter-organizational cooperation and joint resource utilization.
     The principal concepts that will help assure the successful accomplishment of the multi-
     organizational missions of the ECZ are the preservation, modernization, and efficient
     utilization of explosives storage, staging, and maintenance facilities. Management
     involvement, support, and accountability at all levels of responsibility are critical to the
     successful execution of ECZ Program, Master Plan and associated initiatives.
     2.2. Philosophy. The Center’s strategic philosophy is to maintain the ECZ cloud as it is
     currently; as once it is lost, it is never regained. Any proposal for reductions or alterations of
     the ECZ cloud for any reason must align with the Center’s strategic planning objectives and
     be approved by the ECZ committee and appropriately staffed for approval. No approved
     ECZ Cloud reductions will be made until the approved area is ready for development.
     2.3. ECZ Program Manager. In support of this philosophy the ECZ Program Manager
     (PM) should not be tied directly to any organizational workload or mission performed within
     the ECZ. This segregation of interests enables an overall objective vision of Center priorities
     and long term strategic interests as they relate to all ECZ missions; therefore, it was agreed to
     by Center leadership in 2001, the position would be established within the Ogden Air
     Logistics Center, Plans and Programs office (OO-ALC/XP).
        2.3.1. Roles and Responsibilities: The ECZ PM is the ECZ management focal point for
        the Center. The role of ECZ PM is to chair monthly ECZ Committee meetings for
        developing, implementing, and sustaining ECZ management plan initiatives. As the long
        range strategic planner and ECZ Master Plan developer the ECZ PM will serve as the
        coordination focal point for up-channeling ECZ issues requiring resolution or reporting.
        The ECZ PM’s role includes keeping the Center senior level management informed of
        ECZ critical issues, seeking conflict resolution, and attaining support for key ECZ
        initiatives. The ECZ PM is designated as the single point of contact to represent the
        community ownership of the MSA. The owner/user responsibilities outlined in AFI 31-
        101 will be carried out by/through the ECZ Committee with oversight by ECZ
        Chairperson. This provides the single designated user requirement identified in AFI 31-
        101 and ensures all users are involved in development of policy and procedures as well as
        equal sharing of associated user responsibilities.
3. The ECZ Committee: The ECZ Committee is comprised of representatives from
organizations with missions supported from within the ECZ; (Owners/Users), offices with direct
impact/influence on those missions (Key Members) and offices that provide support to ECZ

   3.3. ECZ Committee Execution Management. From a planning and execution
   perspective, the goal of the ECZ committee is to provide a forum for the mutual benefit of
   each ECZ organization. ECZ committee project oversight/management is focused on those
   significant projects that are categorized as milestone projects or events. Continual
   information exchange on project development should help in problem resolution with a
   collective, effort to sustain, and upgrade facility infrastructure capability within the ECZ to
   meet current and future mission requirements; therefore responsible organizations shall:
      3.3.1. Ensure projects meet ECZ development goals and objectives.
      3.3.2. Develop/integrate development milestones and initiatives that encompass all ECZ
      projects.
      3.3.3. Provide a shared resource forum and mutual assistance in resource support.

       3.3.4. As a committee, manage the execution timelines of development projects through
       priority development and cooperative resource sharing.
       3.3.5. Provide Executive Council briefs as necessary.
4. ECZ Master Plan. The overall purpose of the initiatives and efforts specified within the
ECZ Master Plan are to provide a comprehensive Center Level Management Plan for the
effective and efficient utilization of ECZ resources in terms of land, facilities and infrastructure
in support of the current Center Strategic Plan and future mission requirements. The intent of the
plan is to capture the basic requirements data, current and future, for all Hill AFB organizations
to include Little Mountain, UTTR, and 649 MUNS Det 1 at Lackland Air Force Base Annex, to
develop a road map for transformation to meet future requirements. This facilities plan is a
comprehensive and unified management plan serving as a bridge through the 21st century for the
effective and efficient utilization of the ECZ to support OO-ALC, Air Force, Tenant, and joint
missions. The ECZ Master Plan shall be reviewed annually by all ECZ Committee members and
updated at least every two years.
5. ECZ Facility Planning. Critical process definitions for facility planning within the ECZ are
outlined in detail in Section 5 of the ECZ Master Plan. All new facility requirements are initially
presented to the ECZ Program Manager and 75 ABW/SEW for potential location options and
identification of associated impacts. Once the best options have been identified they are
presented to the ECZ Committee for review and approval. The ECZ Committee approved
requirement and siting is then passed to the Facility Planning Committee (FPC) and Facility
Board (FB) for final approval. All FB approved ECZ sites still require Department of Defense
Explosive Safety Board (DDESB) approval before construction can begin.
