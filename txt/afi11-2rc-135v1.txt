     1.2.3.9. Check quality of training accomplished, identify deficiencies, and advise
     wing/group of additional training needs.
     1.2.3.10. Conduct progress reviews. Notify the gaining unit’s commander when a
     student’s progress during qualification/certification training is considered unsatisfactory
     by the SQ/CC.
     1.2.3.11. Submit a training report during the training cycle as directed.
         1.2.3.11.1. Transmit a Training Health Report every fourth month of the training
         cycle (mid-month Feb, Jun and Oct) via email to ACC/A3CR at
         acc.a3crairborne@langley.af.mil. Squadrons will report RAP health, summarizing
         critical training issues IAW the guidance and examples available on the ACC/A3T
         CoP.
         https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=AC-
         OP-02-66-4-2&Filter=AC-OP-02-66. Reports will be submitted through the OG/CC
         and then sent to ACC/A3CR. Attach a current squadron-training health slide to
         summarize critical training issues.
         1.2.3.11.2. Report only significant shortfalls or LIMFACs of events/sorties that affect
         15 percent or greater of the squadron’s aircrew force. Include planned corrective
         action or specific assistance required as appropriate. ACC/A3CR will coordinate to
         rectify or minimize noted shortfalls or LIMFACs while the training cycle is
         underway.
             1.2.3.11.2.1. Shortfalls occur when required mission training tasks are not
             accomplished due to shortages of equipment, etc. Example: unable to accomplish
             training sorties due to aircraft availability.
             1.2.3.11.2.2. LIMFACS are factors, constraints, restrictions, etc., that degrade
             training effectiveness. Example: unable to accomplish training sorties due to
             aerospace issues.
         1.2.3.11.3. Report training requirement deviations, following proration, to
         ACC/A3CR IAW Attachment 3 of this AFI. This report will include training
         requirements waived by the OG/CC. E-mail training reports to ACC/A3CR RAP
         manager at acc.a3crairborne@langley.af.mil.
  1.2.4. Supervisors will:
     1.2.4.1. Monitor individual assigned/attached aircrew currencies and requirements.
     1.2.4.2. Ensure aircrew members only participate in sorties, events, and tasks for which
     they are adequately prepared, trained, and current.
     1.2.4.3. Identify areas where additional training is needed and direct training
     accordingly.
     1.2.4.4. Ensure mission objectives are pre-briefed, debriefed, and evaluated to determine
     successful accomplishment.
  1.2.5. Individual aircrew members will:

        1.2.5.1. Hand-carry copies of all available training records to assist the gaining unit in
        assessing qualifications and training requirements.
        1.2.5.2. Be responsible for completion of training requirements and currencies within the
        guidelines of this AFI.
        1.2.5.3. Correctly log training events per AF, ACC, and local directives for submission
        to the squadron aviation resource management (SARM) section for input into ARMS.
        1.2.5.4. Participate only in ground and flying activities in which they are current and
        qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor/evaluator possessing like-
        qualification(s).
     1.2.6. The SARM section will ensure all training and qualifications status are correctly
     documented and tracked in ARMS.
     1.2.7. Formal school aircrew training system (ATS) contractor will develop, update, and
     maintain courseware, and perform task and media analysis consistent with the applicable
     ATS contract as managed by ACC/TRSS.
1.3. Processing Changes.
     1.3.1. Refer recommended changes to this instruction to MAJCOM/A3 via an AF Form 847,
     Recommendation for Change of Publication.
     1.3.2. MAJCOMs will forward approved recommendations to ACC/A3 and NGB/A3C.
     1.3.3. ACC/A3 will:
        1.3.3.1. Coordinate all changes to the basic instruction with all applicable
        MAJCOM/A3s.
        1.3.3.2. Address time sensitive changes by immediate action message.
        1.3.3.3. Forward recommended changes to AF/A3O-AI for AF/A3/5 approval, IAW AFI
        11-200.
        1.3.3.4. Determine training requirements for the subordinate units. This includes making
        changes, additions, or deletions to this instruction at any time.
1.4. Aircrew Status. As defined in AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training, all aircrew will
be assigned to CMR, BMC, or BAQ status.
     1.4.1. Combat Mission Ready (CMR). A CMR crewmember is proficient in their
     qualification(s) and certification(s) in all of the primary missions tasked to their unit or
     weapon system. Failure to complete training or maintain currency events, as defined in
     ground and flying continuation training tables, results in regression to Non-CMR (N-CMR)
     status.
        1.4.1.1. CMR Positions. All API-1/2/A/Z positions, FEs, flying SQ/CC, and SQ/DO
        positions will be designated as CMR positions. Chief of Weapons and Chief of Safety
        will maintain CMR unless OG/CC deems it is unfeasible. Other staff crewmembers at the
        82 RS and the 95 RS (including 95 RS, Det. 1) will normally be designated API-6/B and
        maintain BMC rates. The SQ/CC or the OG/CC may increase training currency
        requirements for any crewmembers above the CMR/BMC rate to meet training
AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013                                                                        9


       requirements for any mission tasking. The OG/CC may designate other API-6/B positions
       within the wing as CMR. Exception: If a unit is over-manned, the SQ/CC may elect to
       train the front line of their Unit Manning Document (UMD) APIs-1/2/A/Z to CMR and
       designate the overage BMC. In this case, priority should be given to inexperienced
       crewmembers with at least 50%, if available, designated CMR. Reserve/ANG Drill Status
       FTU graduates will train at a minimum of BMC status. (T-3).
       1.4.1.2. FTU students normally graduate CMR eligible. However, they may be N-CMR
       upon completion if they fail to meet SQ/CC certification requirements (ground and/or
       flight) for the unit’s mission. They will train at the CMR-Inexperienced (CMR/N)
       requirement level to establish lookback requirements and will complete the SQ/CC
       certification requirements. Graduates may fly unsupervised provided they are current and
       qualified for the events or sorties to be flown.
   1.4.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed
   mission qualification training, is qualified in some aspect of the unit mission, but does not
   maintain or has not achieved CMR status. The aircrew member must be able to attain full
   qualification to meet operational tasking within 30 days, or as otherwise specified in this
   volume. A BMC crewmember is qualified and familiar in all core missions of the MDS to
   which they are assigned or attached. They may also maintain proficiency and qualification in
   some of the unit’s other core missions. For those missions for which, they maintain
   familiarization only, BMC aircrew must be able to attain proficiency and qualification in 30
   days or less. BMC aircrew may deploy and may participate in any mission for which, they
   are proficient and qualified, without additional training. The SQ/CC will determine if
   additional training is required for BMC crewmembers prior to each deployment. Failure to
   complete BMC required training results in regression to Non-BMC (N-BMC) status.
       1.4.2.1. BMC Positions: All other wing aircrew positions not identified in paragraph
       1.4.1.1.
       1.4.2.2. FTU instructors are designated BMC positions. BMC designations are assigned
       to aircrew that have a primary job performing FTU duties, wing/NAF supervision or staff
       functions that directly support the flying operation. However, these aircrew members are
       required to provide additional sortie generation capability, either in lieu of, or in addition
       to, the personnel assigned to the flying squadrons. Reserve/Drill Status ANG members
       (API-1/2/A positions and FEs) will maintain a minimum of BMC status.
   1.4.3. Basic Qualification (BAQ). An aircrew member who has successfully completed
   initial qualification training and has passed an in-flight evaluation, but has accomplished no
   mission qualification events in an assigned aircraft. BAQ personnel must accomplish mission
   qualification training prior to designation as BMC or CMR.
   1.4.4. N-CMR/N-BMC. Aircrew members that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status will
   comply with Chapters 2 and 3.
1.5. Training. RC/OC/WC/TC-135 aircrew training is designed to progress aircrew from
initial/mission qualification training (I/MQT), difference qualification training (DQT) or
requalification training (RQT) to continuation training (CT). Training limitation times are listed
in Table 1.1. Training scenarios are based on employment plans, location, current intelligence,
 10                                                         AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013


and threat capabilities. A balanced mixture of flight, simulator, and academic training in each
phase prepares aircrew members for the next phase of qualification.

AC/TC/AMS/AA/DLO
   1.5.1. All formal training combines both IQT and MQT. IQT and MQT progress
   concurrently and provide the training necessary to initially qualify or requalify a
   crewmember in a specific aircrew position and flying duties to perform the mission assigned
   to a specific unit or aircraft model. Completion of I/MQT is a pre-requisite for BMC and
   CMR. I/MQT, apart from CMC students, is accomplished by the 338 CTS in conjunction
   with formal training course attendance.
   1.5.2. Senior staff officers transitioning to the RC-135 will be trained to a Basic Aircrew
   Qualification (BAQ) level. BAQ aircrew members have completed a flight evaluation and
   are qualified to perform basic aircrew duties. Squadron CC/DOs will carefully choose those
   missions on which BAQ aircrew members may fly unsupervised. Without an
   instructor/evaluator, BAQ aircrew members will only fly local training sorties performing
   those duties for which they have been trained and qualified. BAQ aircrew will not participate
   on operational missions or other advanced exercises without an instructor. Except for
   General Officers or General Officer selects at or above the wing level, BAQ is not a long
   term qualification status. Waiver authority for any crewmember, other than General Officers,
   to remain BAQ for longer than 6 months is the MAJCOM A3.
   1.5.3. Mission Certification Training (MCT). MCT is additional training directed by the
   SQ/CC to attain unit specific mission certification(s) in order to be considered CMR for that
   unit and its mission(s). Completion of MCT will be documented via AF Form 1381, USAF
   Certification of Aircrew Training, or equivalent and placed in the member’s training folder.
   1.5.4. Continuation Training (CT). There are two aspects of CT. The first is basic
   proficiency training required to ensure safe operation of the aircraft. The second consists of
   specific mission-related training required to accomplish the unit’s assigned missions.
   1.5.5. Specialized Training. This is additional training that may be identified to meet
   unforeseen tasking that would require specialized training (e.g. low altitude operations
   qualification) or a specific QRC. It may not be required for every aircrew member.
   Specialized training may consist of some continuation training events. Specialized training is
   accomplished after an aircrew is assigned CMR/BMC status, and is in addition to
   CMR/BMC requirements. Aircrew in CMR or BMC positions may hold special capabilities
   and qualifications as long as additional training requirements are accomplished.
1.6. Training Concepts and Policies.
AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013                                                                      11


  1.6.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness
  consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for
  realism against the expected threat, aircrew capabilities, and safety. This instruction provides
  training guidelines and policies to be used with operational procedures specified in applicable
  flight publications.
  1.6.2. Training missions will be designed to achieve combat capability in squadron tasked
  roles, maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. Training
  missions should emphasize either basic combat skills or scenarios that reflect procedures and
  operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and enemy capabilities.
  Crewmembers will practice procedures/actions applicable to combat scenarios or
  reconnaissance operations (e.g. appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures,
  combat tactics, safe recovery procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions,
  an intelligence briefing, and debriefing).
  1.6.3. ACC Training Support Squadron (ACC/TRSS) will develop and validate training
  programs when/where tasked by the ACC/A3. Other MAJCOMs may submit requests for
  training program support to the ACC/A3. If validated, these requests will be prioritized and
  tasked to ACC/TRSS. These syllabi will be coordinated through the OG/CC and submitted to
  ACC/TRSS for coordination and ACC approval. (See ACCI 36-2250.)
  1.6.4. The SQ/CC determines the level of supervision necessary to accomplish the required
  training. If the mission objectives include introduction to tasks or instruction to correct
  previous discrepancies, then an instructor may be required. Use flight evaluators and
  instructors for any phase of training to capitalize on their expertise and experience.
     1.6.4.1. Instructors will comply with the requirements of this instruction. All squadron
     level instructors should be CMR with the exception of instructors at forward operating
     locations, staff instructors assigned to the OSS/ISS and FTU instructors.
     1.6.4.2. The following personnel will be supervised by an instructor possessing like
     qualification(s) when performing aircrew duties:
         1.6.4.2.1. All non-current aircrew members.
         1.6.4.2.2. All aircrew members in initial, difference, upgrade, or requalification
         flying training.
         1.6.4.2.3. Unqualified crewmembers and senior officers as defined in AFI 11-202
         Volume 1 and any other staff personnel the WG, OG, or SQ/CCs designate as
         required to fly with an instructor.
         1.6.4.2.4. For unqualified, non-current, or senior officer pilots, the instructor pilot
         must be at a set of controls during critical phases of flight.
     1.6.4.3. Every attempt should be made to ensure instructor continuity for crewmembers
     in initial mission qualification, requalification, difference training, and upgrade training.
     If the number of instructors exceeds three (flight deck) or five (EWO/IIO/ASE/CMC)
     document the fact with a memo for record in the individual’s training folder. Note:
     Squadron commanders, operations officers and CTS Specialty Chiefs will not be included
     in this limitation.

   1.6.5. The aircrew training cycle is 12 months coincident with the fiscal year. Units will
   complete training requirements during the appropriate training cycle. Training shortfalls
   during this period will be reported IAW paragraph 1.2.4.11.2
   1.6.6. The use of simulators is required to enhance flight training. The Operational Flight
   Trainer (OFT), RIVET JOINT Mission Trainer (RJMT), Mission Crew Training System
   (MCTS), PACER CRAG Tabletop Trainer and operational aircraft with ground power are
   simulators authorized for aircrew training. Aircrew may credit events for currency and
   training cycle requirements in these simulators per OG/CC guidance.
1.7. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP)
1.7.1. RAP is the continuation training (CT) program designed to focus training on capabilities
needed to accomplish a unit’s basic tasked missions. RAP tasking is executed IAW the
RC/OC/WC/TC-135 RAP Tasking Memo. Each RAP qualification level is defined by a total
number of RAP sorties, broken down into mission types and associated events as determined by
the MAJCOM and unit commanders. Aircrew members will receive training in all MDS aircraft
they are qualified in and will be assigned to either a CMR or a BMC position in the unit. The
standard sortie requirements in Table 1.2 establish the minimum number of RAP sorties per
training cycle for BMC and CMR levels of training.

   1.7.2. Progression from Non-experienced (N) to Experienced (E). The fourth letter in each
   crew position designates experience levels. The minimum progression criteria for
   advancement from non-experienced to experienced is listed in Table 1.3. Squadron
   commanders may progress crewmembers at their discretion once crewmembers have met
   these minimum requirements or have acquired sufficient simulator sorties that would
   approximate these requirements.

Notes:
1. Qualified in a C2ISR/EA M/S with like mission and equipment
2. Multi-qualified ASEs may be designated experienced based on their primary assigned
aircraft.
3. Must be certified as CMR/BMC in primary position(s) and assigned for minimum of 6
months, e.g. an AMS may have been qualified for 2 years as a DLO but is not experienced in
their new position as AMS until qualified 6 months as an AMS.
4. Qualified in an ISR M/S with like mission and equipment
5. Up to 500 hours of total flying time can be gained from the use of ATDs
6. Must have at least 1 operational sortie as an SEO. Commander, AFTAC, Detachment 1 has
the final authority for designating experience level.
1.8. Multiple MDS Qualification.
   1.8.1. Qualification in more than one RC/OC/WC/TC–135 aircraft does not require
   MAJCOM/A3 authorization. All –135s are considered the same mission design series (MDS)
   for basic qualification purposes. However, crewmembers flying multiple models (i.e. RC-135
   V/W, RC-135S, and RC-135U) may need to obtain qualification or certifications in the
   various models depending on the requirements listed in this AFI and AFI 11-2RC-135
   Volume 2, RC/OC/WC/TC-135—Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
   1.8.2. Due to the unique duties of Cryptologic Mission Crewmembers (CMCs), Airborne
   Systems Engineers (ASEs) and Information Integration Officers (IIOs) and the various
   service requirements/taskings, CMCs/ASEs/IIOs may be required to augment non-RC-135
   MDS. The OG/CC will forward multiple qualification requests to ACC/A3CR for approval
   IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1 and AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, to allow retention of
   RC-135 qualification while augmenting the additional MDS. The owning squadron of the
   individual requiring a Multiple-MDS waiver will be responsible for generating and staffing
   the waiver through their Group Stan/Eval. All Multiple–MDS waivers will be placed in the
   individual’s flight evaluation folder and will be reviewed annually. Individuals are required
   to complete, at a minimum, all egress, emergency procedures, aircrew flight equipment and
   qualification training for the additional MDS they will qualify in.
   1.8.3. Crew members qualified on multiple models and/or multiple MDS’ will maintain the
   SQ/CC required proficiency level (BMC/CMR) for each aircraft they maintain qualifications
   on. Crew members are only required to update events that are different in order to maintain
   required proficiency level.
1.9. Training Records and Reports.
   1.9.1. Units will maintain crewmember records for individual training and evaluations IAW:

       1.9.1.5. Appropriate MAJCOM directives.
   1.9.2. Track the following information for all aircrew members (as applicable):
       1.9.2.1. Ground training.
       1.9.2.2. Requirements and accomplishment of individual sorties, RAP sorties, sortie
       types, and events cumulatively for the training cycle.
       1.9.2.3. Total RAP sorties for 1-month and 3-month lookback.
       1.9.2.4. Currencies.
   1.9.3. Training Folder Requirements. A training folder will be initiated for all qualification,
   upgrade, and additional training directed by the squadron commander or a flight examiner.
   The training folder will include approved Air Force forms for all training reports and other
   applicable records used in the formal training program. The training documents will be
   placed in reverse chronological order with the most recent on top.
       1.9.3.1. FTU will ensure formal school records will be incorporated into the individual’s
       training folder and delivered to the gaining unit for review within 20 duty days of
       completion of the formal course.
       1.9.3.2. Crewmembers who PCS or PCA will hand-carry any active training folders to
       the gaining unit. Any incomplete training will be clearly identified on appropriate forms.
       Classified portions will be couriered to gaining unit within 20 duty days.
       1.9.3.3. Units will maintain training folders on each aircrew member. Units may keep
       electronic or paper copies of the training history. Training records will be kept by the
       aircrew member’s flying unit for as long as the member flies with the 55 WG.
1.10. Aircrew Utilization Policy.
   1.10.1. Commanders will ensure that wing/group aircrew members (API-1/2/6/A/B/Z) fill
   authorized positions IAW unit manning documents and that crewmember status is properly
   designated. The overall objective is that aircrew members perform combat-related duties.
   Supervisors may assign aircrew to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, FEB/mishap board
   member, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of aircrew
   tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience.
   1.10.2. Commanders will ensure wing/group staff crewmembers (API-6/Bs) perform duties
   justified in HQ ACC manpower standards documents and authorized UMDs.
   1.10.3. Students assigned to the 338 CTS will not be assigned additional duties upon entry
   into syllabus training.
   1.10.4. Aircrew members whose status is “duty not including flying” (DNIF) may log
   ground training events, including simulator, if the member’s physical condition allows it. The
AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013                                                                       15


   flight surgeon should be consulted if the crewmember’s ability to complete training is in
   question. Aircrew members that are on long term DNIF status, or have been suspended from
   flying operations, may perform non-flying related duties regardless of their experience level.
   1.10.5. Aircrew will not perform long-term duties that detract from primary duties of
   training for or performing the unit flying mission.
1.11. Sortie Allocation Guidance.
   1.11.1. Use the following guidance to determine sortie allocation priorities for scheduling.
      1.11.1.1. CMR/API-1/2/A/Z. Currency events required for deploying aircrew members
      to be fully mission capable to perform their duties on operational sorties. Inexperienced
      API-1/2/A/Z aircrew members should receive sortie allocation priority over experienced
      aircrew members.
      1.11.1.2. Syllabus sorties.
      1.11.1.3. CMR/API-1/2/A/Z Proficiency and continuation training events. Non-
      experienced API-1/2/A/Z aircrew members should receive sortie allocation priority over
      experienced aircrew members.
      1.11.1.4. CMR API-6/B.
      1.11.1.5. BMC.
   1.11.2. API-8 (above wing level) personnel flying authorizations will be IAW AFI 11-401
   and HQ ACC guidance. They will fly the BMC rate; however they are not required to
   complete BMC specific missions/events. Units should provide assigned API-6/8/B/D flyers
   adequate resources to maintain minimum training requirements. However, API-6/8/B/D flyer
   support will not come at the expense of the flying squadron’s primary mission. If attached
   units cannot meet attached flyer requirements, they must request relief IAW AFI 11-401.
   Units requiring flying hour adjustments for attached API-8/D and applicable API-6 flyers
   must request program changes IAW AFI 11-102 ACC_SUP, Flying Hours Program
   Management.
1.12. Waiver Authority.
   1.12.1. Waiver authority for all requirements of the RAP tasking memo is the OG/CC.
   Additional guidance may be provided in the memo. For all other provisions of this volume
   and IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1, the waiver authority is MAJCOM/A3. All waivers or issues
   involving ANG personnel will be coordinated with the 170 GP/CC (NEANG).
      1.12.1.1. Submit waivers to the requirements of this AFI via message, memo, fax or
      email through the group training office to the OG/CC, and then to the MAJCOM/A3 for

                                            Chapter 2

                                     FORMAL TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines formal training of aircrew members into RC/OC/WC/TC-
135 aircraft. Formal training, to include initial qualification training (IQT), mission qualification
training (MQT), requalification training (RQT), central flight instructor course (CFIC), faculty
training course (FTC), and senior staff qualification training (SSQT), will normally be conducted
by the 338 CTS. Difference qualification training (DQT) will normally be accomplished by
operational squadrons. Formal training may be conducted or completed in-unit with ACC/A3C
approval. Evaluations for conversion training may be conducted by 645 AESS personnel with
ACC/A3C and unit approval.
   2.1.1. The primary method of qualification training is to attend and complete the appropriate
   formal training course listed in the Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA).
   Completing the appropriate formal course satisfies all qualification training requirements.
   2.1.2. Formal training may be conducted in operational squadrons IAW provisions of this
   chapter and with the approval of OG/CC. The in-unit formal training will be conducted using
   appropriate USAF training syllabus, flow programs, and requirements. Unit training flights
   (DOT) will contact 338 CTS for an approved training program. (T-3).
   2.1.3. Mission training is integrated with qualification training. However, some aircrew
   mission specific training events can be accomplished separately to allow for security
   clearance issues, aircraft model and/or squadron transitions, etc.
2.2. Prerequisites. Each aircrew member must comply with the appropriate formal training
course prerequisites prescribed in the ETCA and the requisite ACC approved syllabus before
entering qualification training. Prior to flight training, aircrew members will meet the following
requirements:
   2.2.1. Egress training.
   2.2.2. Aircrew flight equipment training.
   2.2.3. Flight records review.
   2.2.4. Local area survival training (Initial only). (Not required for TDY personnel.)
2.3. Ground Training.
   2.3.1. 55 OSS will develop and instruct the following ground training:
       2.3.1.1. Aircrew life support equipment training
       2.3.1.2. Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Training
       2.3.1.3. OPLAN 8010 Procedures
           2.3.1.3.1. Each crewmember, IAW RC-135 RAP Tasking Memo, will demonstrate
           satisfactory knowledge of the unit’s assigned mission during the OPLAN 8010
           certification and/or the operational certification to a formal board. Board members
           will be determined by the WG/CC or the OG/CC. The WG/CC will approve, in
 18                                                          AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013


          writing, who is authorized as a certifying official. These certifications may be
          completed prior to graduation from I/MQT, DQT, or RQT course.
          2.3.1.3.2. The mission training events listed in paragraph 2.7.2. will be completed
          prior to OPLAN 8010 certification.
       2.3.1.4. Flash blindness protection
   2.3.2. Squadrons will develop and instruct the following ground training:
       2.3.2.1. Mission Certification Training (MCT) (as applicable)
       2.3.2.2. Special qualifications (as applicable)
   2.3.3. Initial egress training will be accomplished using the aircraft, aircraft diagrams and
   pre-positioned aircrew flight equipment as training aids. For continuation training, see LL03
   in Attachment 2. (See ACCI 11-301 for more information.)
   2.3.4. Ground training accomplished during I/MQT, DQT, or RQT establishes due dates for
   subsequent continuation training.
2.4. Flying Training. The unit(s) must prepare a training program designed to maintain mission
qualification and prevent regression of proficiency. Squadron-developed training programs
should use profiles typical of squadron missions.
   2.4.1. Approved in-unit training must be accomplished according to applicable formal
   training or approved school courseware if available.
   2.4.2. All academic training required for qualification will be completed prior to flight
   evaluation and certification in the unit operational mission. All exceptions will be noted and
   justified in the student’s training records prior to in-flight evaluation.
   2.4.3. BMC or CMR individuals transferring between units will complete mission
   certification training (MCT) or difference training as determined by the gaining unit’s
   SQ/CC. This training should be based on experience, proficiency, currency, and previous
   formal training of the transferring individual. BMC or CMR individuals transferring between
   units must, as a minimum, complete the unit mission briefing (UMB). Use the multiple
   qualification section in Chapter 1 to help determine when an evaluation is required.
   2.4.4. Initial/mission, difference, requalification, upgrade, or special qualification training
   conducted during operational missions will be in accordance with AFI 11-220,
   Reconnaissance Flight Rules and Procedures (a classified document), AFI 11-2RC-135 series
   instructions and specific theater OPORDs and directives. An instructor of like specialty will
   supervise students on these sorties (like specialty for CMC is based on position qualification
   not target specialty). SQ/CC will ensure the training will not impact mission effectiveness
   nor expose crewmembers to unnecessary risks.
   2.4.5. All ground and flight training requirements in ACC approved syllabi will be
   completed prior to the flight evaluation except as annotated in the respective syllabi. All
   CMR ground training requirements must be completed for aircrew to be eligible to be
   certified as CMR by the respective operational squadron commander. CMCs will have 120
   days after completion of qualification training to complete the cryptologic skills proficiency
   test (CSPT) and become eligible to be certified as CMR. Aircrew who will be certified as
AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013                                                                   19


   BMC need only accomplish those ground and flight training events necessary to maintain
   BMC status.
   2.4.6. Flight training events accomplished during I/MQT/RQT/SSQT are not creditable for
   continuation training requirements. Crewmembers undergoing RQT for loss of qualification
   less than one year will have their CT requirements pro-rated IAW Table 3.1. Events
   accomplished IAW 11-202V2 are creditable for continuation training and establish currency.
   DQT, Pre-CFIC, and CFIC instructor upgrade flight training events are creditable for
   continuation training requirements. Pilots enrolled in Pre-PUP training may continue to log
   flight training events flown in the right seat towards continuation training requirements.
   2.4.7. SQ/CC may recommend early upgrade based on time logged in ATDs.
2.5. CMR/BMC Certification. The gaining squadron commander certifies aircrew members as
CMR or BMC when training is complete.
   2.5.1. Qualification documents are filed in the crewmember’s FEF. Certifications will be
   annotated on the AF Form 1381 or equivalent in the crewmember’s training folder.
   2.5.2. A tailored training program will be used to re-qualify aircrew that have regressed from
   BMC or CMR for any reason. This training will specifically address deficiencies which
   caused regression to re-qualify regressed aircrew.
2.6. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). IQT is used for qualifying newly assigned
crewmembers or re-qualifying crewmembers that have been unqualified for more than 8 years.
   2.6.1. The primary method of initial qualification is to attend and complete the appropriate
   formal training course listed in the ETCA. Completing the appropriate formal course satisfies
   all qualification training requirements.
   2.6.2. All initial qualification training will be conducted at the 338 CTS and/or IAW
   approved ACC syllabus. Document all initial qualification training in the individual’s
   training folder.
   2.6.3. 55 WG units will forward the names of candidates to the 338 CTS/CCR to fill
   allocated training quotas no later than 30 days prior to class start date.
   2.6.4. Upon completion of a formal training program (syllabus complete and passed flight
   evaluation), crew members are considered mission qualified.
      2.6.4.1. The FTU will complete required CMR IQT/MQT training events before
      releasing the student to the gaining squadron, unless waived by the gaining SQ/CC.
      When CMR events are not completed during IQT/MQT, the FTU will document those
      items still required on the individual’s AF Form 1381 or equivalent and forward to the
      gaining squadron DOT.
      2.6.4.2. ACLs are not considered CMR after completion of IQT/MQT at the FTU. Part
      of the ACL requirement for CMR is completion of the CSP. Once the individual
      completes the CSP at the gaining unit, they can be considered CMR by the squadron
      commander.
      2.6.4.3. When the crewmember’s training is complete, the unit DOT will accomplish an
      AF Form 4324, IAW AFI11-401 and AFI11-401_ACCSUP, and route through the unit
      Stan/Eval. Stan/Eval will use this to document CMR certification and update the letter of
 20                                                          AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013


       certification (letter of X’s). The crewmember is not considered mission qualified (CMR)
       until all IQT/MQT training is complete and the unit commander signs the letter of
       certification.
2.7. Mission Qualification Training. Most mission qualification training events are integrated
into the aircrew qualification syllabus and are accomplished in conjunction with aircrew
qualification. A separate mission qualification evaluation is not required for RC/OC/WC/TC-135
aircrew; aircrew will be certified in their respective missions by their gaining SQ/CC.
   2.7.1. CMR crewmembers will be required to perform nuclear, conventional SRO, and
   conventional contingency missions based on their respective aircraft mission. BMC
   crewmembers normally qualify/certify on all missions performed by their assigned primary
   aircraft but train to maintain familiarization rather than currency. BMC crewmembers must
   be capable of attaining currency/proficiency in all their assigned primary aircraft’s missions
   within 30 days. The flying SQ/CC determines assigned/attached BMC aircrew utilization.
   2.7.2. The following mission training events are required for OPLAN 8010 Certification:
   OPLAN 8010 Command and Control Procedures (G030), OPLAN 8010 Study (G040),
   OPLAN 8010 Certification Brief (Q006), Aircrew Life Support Equipment (LL06), Initial
   PLZT Goggle Training, if helmet is modified (Pilot/Nav Only) and Alert Start Procedures
   (Pilot Only).
   2.7.3. The following mission training events are required for SRO/Contingency operations:
   US/Russia Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities, Tactics, Aircrew Intelligence, Unit
   Mission Brief, ISOPREP, Operational Certification, Special Survival Training (SERE 220).
   2.7.4. The Cryptologic Skills Program (CSP) is required for 1A8X1 personnel IAW AFI 14-
   125, Cryptologic Skills Program.
   2.7.5. The SQ/CC is the approving authority for mission qualifying/certifying crew members
   on more than one mission aircraft. (ANG: Coordinate through the 170 GP/CC, respective
   ANG SQ/CC and attached active flying SQ/CC.) For example: 45 RS Flight deck personnel
   may qualify and certify on both the COBRA BALL and COMBAT SENT, or both the OPEN
   SKIES and CONSTANT PHOENIX at the discretion of the 45 RS/CC.
2.8. Difference Qualification Training (DQT). DQT is used for two types of training. First, it
can be used to train crewmembers in a different system/tactic (e.g. baseline or avionic upgrades)
within the same/similar aircraft. Second, DQT can be used to train mission crew personnel
already qualified in one crew position in a subsequent crew position within the same MDS and
crew specialty. Difference qualifications/certifications will use formal flight and academic
training prescribed by the formal syllabus (if available) or unit developed training profile.
OG/CC approved difference training may be completed at the FTU or trained in-unit and will be
documented in the individual’s training folder. (T-3).
   2.8.1. The OG/CC will determine whether DQT requires a certification or flight evaluation
   with the exception of the following transitions:
       2.8.1.1. Pilots transitioning between TF-33 and TCTO-509 aircraft require difference
       qualification training and a flight evaluation.
       2.8.1.2. Navigators transitioning between TF-33 and TCTO-509 aircraft require only
       difference certification training and SQ/CC certification.
AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013                                                                 21


     2.8.1.3. Pilots and navigators transitioning between different -135 aircraft or those
     receiving multiple -135 certifications require difference certification training and SQ/CC
     certification, at a minimum.
     2.8.1.4. Pilots and navigators qualified in the KC-135/B-707 and transitioning to the
     RC/OC/WC/TC-135 require a difference course and evaluation.
     2.8.1.5. Electronic Warfare Officers’ difference training is based on mission equipment
     utilization.
        2.8.1.5.1. Crewmembers transferring between or those receiving multiple
        qualifications on -135 aircraft employing like equipment (e.g. AEELS II) require 55
        OG/CC approved difference qualification training. These training programs may be
        conducted in-unit or at 338 CTS. 55 OSS/OST will forward copies of these training
        plans and programs to ACC/A3C.
        2.8.1.5.2. Crewmembers transferring between -135 aircraft required to operate
        different mission equipment require formal difference qualification flight and
        academic training followed by a flight evaluation. Prior to beginning difference
        qualification training of this type, 55 OG/CC will review the training plan and
        forward it to ACC/A3C for final approval.
     2.8.1.6. Airborne Systems Engineer difference qualification training is based on crew
     position.
        2.8.1.6.1. Airborne Systems Engineers transferring between -135 aircraft require
        only difference training.
        2.8.1.6.2. Airborne Systems Engineers obtaining additional position qualifications on
        the same -135 model require formal training at the FTU. Further information can be
        found in paragraph 4.5.
     2.8.1.7. CMC transitioning from RC-135V/W to RC-135 U/S require a difference
     certification. Transition from RC-135U/S to RC-135V/W requires a difference
     qualification.
  2.8.2. The OG/CC in consultation with 645 AESS/CC, will determine what constitutes a
  major or minor system change.
     2.8.2.1. A minor system change within the same MDS requires a difference training and
     certification as a minimum. Document all difference training completion in the
     individual’s active training folder, maintain the folder IAW AFRIMS. Unit
     standardization and evaluation will document the difference certification on the squadron
     letter of certification (letter of Xs).
     2.8.2.2. A major system change will be handled as conversion training and will require a
     difference qualification evaluation. Unit standardization and evaluation will document the
     certification and evaluation on the squadron letter of certification (letter of Xs).
     2.8.2.3. For all system changes, ACC will coordinate with AFMC to ensure adequate
     training resources are provided as part of the acquisition program. ACC/A3CR will assist
     55 OG in developing training programs in concert with 645 AESS. Prior to beginning
 22                                                          AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013


       conversion or difference training for a system upgrade, 55 OG/CC will review the
       training plan and forward it to ACC/A3C for final approval.
2.9. Requalification Training (RQT). Requalification training is used to qualify former
RC/OC/WC/TC-135 crewmembers who are returning to fly mission aircraft or to qualify
crewmembers that are unqualified due to loss of currency (except for touch and go’s). An
individual is considered non-current in an area when they exceed the time requirements for
events as dictated by the specific crew position.
   2.9.1. An aircrew member is unqualified upon either loss of currency exceeding 6 months or
   expiration of the mission/qualification check, whichever occurs first. Requalification
   requirements are as follows:
       2.9.1.1. Loss of currency up to 6 months does not constitute loss of qualification. To
       regain currency, crewmembers will accomplish training as directed by the SQ/CC and a
       proficiency demonstration of the non-current event(s) to an instructor possessing like
       qualification(s). Loss of currency exceeding 6 months results in an unqualified status.
       2.9.1.2. Unqualified up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment, or up to 51
       months at the end of any active flying assignment. Perform training as directed by the
       SQ/CC. Individuals need to requalify only in events required by their training level. A
       flight check by an evaluator qualified in the same crew position is required once certified
       proficient in the non-current or non-qualified event(s) by an instructor of the same crew
       position. Complete a flight evaluation covering the items directed in the training program.
       If the individual’s periodic flight evaluation has expired, a full qualification evaluation
       must be administered.
       2.9.1.3. Unqualified 39 months or more at the end of a non-flying assignment, or 51 or
       more months at the end of any active flying assignment, up to 8 years. Complete the
       appropriate ETCA requalification academic course at the FTU and an in-flight
       evaluation. The requalification academic flying course may be accomplished in-unit, with
       a waiver from ACC/A3C.
       2.9.1.4. Unqualified over 8 years. Complete the appropriate ETCA formal initial
       qualification course. Waiver authority is IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1.
   2.9.2. Basic and instructor requalification may be conducted simultaneously. Consult AFI
   11-202 Volume 2 and AFI 11-2RC-135 Volume 2 for guidance on simultaneous evaluations.
2.10. Senior Staff Qualification Training (SSQT). SSQT is designed for senior staff officers
(colonel selects and above) as well as a small number of certain wing senior staff positions.
   2.10.1. Course prerequisites are listed in the ETCA and the RC-135 SSQT syllabus.
   2.10.2. Senior staff officers will complete SSQT in the appropriate -135 based upon the
   manner they will perform flight duties.
   2.10.3. SSQT graduates will be BAQ qualified and eligible for upgrade to BMC/CMR status
   with HQ ACC/A3 approval.
   2.10.4. Senior officers must complete initial qualification/requalification requirements and
   must maintain BMC continuation flying requirements in the -135, including simulators, to fly
   unsupervised in the assigned -135. Only general officers in commander billets, senior officers
AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013                                                                       23


   in NAF, wing, operations group commander positions and the 170 GP/CC (NEANG)
   position who maintain BMC or higher are eligible to fly in their primary assigned aircraft
   without instructor supervision.
   2.10.5. All formal training courses for senior officers conducted at the 338 CTS require
   approval at the following levels:
       2.10.5.1. Colonel and colonel (selects): ACC/A3C (NGB/A3C for ANG officers only).
       2.10.5.2. General selects and above: ACC/A3.
   2.10.6. Senior officers in training in the FTU are in formal training status. Unit duties will be
   turned over to appropriate deputies or vice commanders until training is completed. ACC/A3
   must approve exceptions to this policy.
   2.10.7. Wing Commanders should qualify in only one of their wing’s aircraft (preferably in
   their wing’s predominant aircraft). Either the WG/CV or OG/CC should qualify in the wing’s
   other aircraft.
2.11. Conversion Training. Conversion training is usually conducted off station with the
engineering specialists responsible for converting to the new system (e.g. new engines, baseline
upgrades, minor system upgrades). These personnel will provide conversion training for the
initial cadre whenever possible. In some instances, it will be necessary for units to form an initial
cadre of personnel for whom certain training requirements may be waived. 645 AESS,
Greenville, TX is considered the primary base for conversion training when new systems come
online which represent significant changes from current aircraft configurations. Initial cadre
completing conversion training will provide DQT to other unit aircrew members at home station.
Coordinate cross-command training/evaluations through OG/CC to ACC/A3C and 645 AESG.
   2.11.1. The following conditions apply to management of initial cadre aircrew qualification:
   Form a nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) to begin aircrew
   conversion. Unless directed otherwise by the OG, the initial cadre will be made up of FTU
   instructors and will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held unless
   previously qualified in the conversion aircraft.
       2.11.1.1. The OG/CC will determine which training events are applicable after
       examining the training and evaluation records of initial cadre.
       2.11.1.2. The OG/CC will review the proposed training qualification plan and forward to
       HQ ACC/A3C for approval prior to beginning conversion training for major system
       changes.
       2.11.1.3. Crewmembers will complete all academic and ground training events before
       starting flight training on new systems.
   2.11.2. Prior to evaluation/certification, complete all training recommended on any
   equipment, systems or crew procedures which differ from that in the mission series (M/S)-
   135 aircraft initial crewmembers are currently qualified.
   2.11.3. Crewmembers will complete closed book qualification examination, prior to
   unsupervised flight when emergency procedures are different.
   2.11.4. Difference qualification or difference certification (as applicable) is the squadron
   commander’s validation that all difference training is complete. Unit standardization and
 24                                                         AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013


   evaluation will document difference qualifications in the individual’s FEF. The host unit
   providing conversion training will document all conversion training and maintain the training
   folder IAW AFRIMS.
2.12. Instructor Training. All instructors must be graduates of a formal instructor course in
order to conduct flight training. Only those instructors who have completed the 338 CTS faculty
training course (FTC) may conduct I/MQT, FTC and SSQT qualification training. Waiver
authority is the 338 CTS/CC. RQT, DQT and CFIC do not require instructors who have
completed the 338 CTS FTC. Chapter 4 further defines the prerequisites for instructor training.
2.13. Faculty Training Course (FTC). A certification training program taught by the 338
CTS, designed to qualify RC/OC/WC/TC-135 instructors for faculty duties in the FTU or
operational squadron. Graduates are fully qualified FTU flight instructors. The 338 CTS/CC will
determine requirements for FTC certification.
2.14. Special Qualifications. The squadron commander may determine certain special
capabilities that crew members will need to maintain to accomplish certain missions. The unit’s
DOT will develop a training program for this capability. The training plan will be forwarded to
OST for coordination and OG approval. OST will direct ARMS to generate event identifiers to
track training and currencies as required. OST will forward copies of these training plans and
programs to ACC/A3C.
2.15. Formal Training Reports. Feedback is an important tool for improving qualification
training programs. All students will complete an ATS contractor generated end of course critique
following completion of the ATS phase of training (as required). ACC TRSS Det 10 will send
post-graduate training critiques to each student and their supervisor approximately three to six
months after graduation. The student and supervisor will complete their respective critiques and
return them to ACC TRSS DET 10. ACC TRSS Det 10 will generate post-graduate critiques for
all RC/OC/WC/TC-135 training conducted in the 55 OG and will maintain the critique findings
and actions taken for 24 months.
AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013                                                                     25

                                CONTINUATION TRAINING

3.1. General. This chapter contains guidance on continuation ground and flying training
requirements for CMR, BMC, and BAQ aircrew.
3.2. Ground Training. Commanders will direct additional training, as necessary, to ensure all
aircrew attain and maintain a state of proficiency which will permit immediate and successful
completion of the unit’s assigned mission. Ground training will be accomplished IAW the
aircrew specific ground training tables in the RTM. Waiver authority for the ground training
specified is IAW the reference directive. This list is intended to be a single source reference for
RC/OC/WC/TC-135 specific ground training only, which will be tracked in ARMS. This list
does not include non-RC/OC/WC/TC-135 specific ancillary training (e.g. SABC, IA training)
which should not be tracked in ARMS. Where discrepancies exist, the reference directive takes
precedence.
   3.2.1. A qualified instructor who instructs a class receives credit for that academic training
   requirement. The instructor must be current on the event prior to teaching the class.
   3.2.2. Ground training accomplished during any phase of qualification training may be
   credited toward continuation training requirements for the training cycle in which it was
   accomplished.
   3.2.3. Crewmembers that enter N-BMC/CMR status because of overdue ground training will
   regain BMC/CMR status upon completion of training.
   3.2.4. Units are encouraged to combine like courses whenever possible and teach only those
   portions applicable to their aircraft and mission. The time allotted for each course listed in
   the aircrew training syllabi should be used as a scheduling guide. The actual time required
   may vary based upon the needs and experience of the class. Course descriptions are listed in
   Attachment 2.
   3.2.5. BMC crewmembers need not maintain currency on CMR ground training events for
   which they maintain familiarization only, but must regain currency on the events prior to
   flying operational or training mission for which that training event applies. Alert status is
   considered an operational flying mission.
   3.2.6. Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT):
       3.2.6.1. This training is not an evaluation, but a review of abnormal/emergency
       procedures and aircraft systems operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. SEPTs
       should be accomplished in small groups so all members may participate to the fullest
       extent possible. Aircrews are highly encouraged to conduct SEPT training during mission
       planning. One crewmember should present an abnormal/emergency situation and the
       group should discuss actions necessary to cope with the malfunction and carry the
       scenario to a logical conclusion. Critical action procedures and squadron special interest
       items should be emphasized.
 26                                                           AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013


       3.2.6.2. SEPT training will be accomplished each calendar month, and the currency will
       expire at the end of the following month. Failure to accomplish by the end of the
       following month will result in grounding until subsequently completed.
       3.2.6.3. 338 CTS student SEPTs may satisfy the monthly SEPT requirement for the
       instructor who administers this training.
       3.2.6.4. Incorporate the following elements into squadron SEPT training programs:
          3.2.6.4.1. SQ/CC or DO involvement in the selection of a monthly SEPT topic.
          3.2.6.4.2. Develop SEPT scenarios using RC/OC/WC/TC-135 mishaps/incidents as
          baseline cases.
       3.2.6.5. Completion of a systems simulator profile satisfies the monthly SEPT
       requirement. Instructing a systems simulator will satisfy the SEPT requirement.
3.3. Flying Training. All aircrew will accomplish the events shown in their respective
continuation flight tables as stated in the RTM. Failure to accomplish these events requires
additional training as determined by the SQ/CC.
   3.3.1. Unit schedulers will tailor sorties to maximize training and use flying time effectively.
   3.3.2. IAW paragraph 2.4.6, flight training accomplished during IQT/RQT is not creditable
   to continuation training requirements, but can be used to establish currency dates. See this
   chapter, Proration of end-of-cycle requirements, for more information. DQT, Pre- and Post-
   CFIC instructor upgrade training, and right seat events in PUP are creditable for continuation
   training and currency requirements.
       3.3.2.1. Individuals enrolled in formal training that hold multiple qualifications may be
       prorated for their current qualification and the position for which they are in training.
   3.3.3. The continuation training program is based on a rotating 12-month period and
   correlates to the fiscal year.
3.4. FTU-Assigned Instructors.
   3.4.1. FTU-assigned instructors will maintain BMC. They may provide simulator training
   while DNIF or N-BMC provided they maintain currency in the simulator.
   3.4.2. Instructors cannot regain currency in any continuation training event they are non-
   current in by dual logging it as an instructor.
   3.4.3. Instructors may credit/dual-log 50% continuation training events on sorties with
   unqualified students. An instructor flying on sortie M-1 may log a proficiency sortie when all
   syllabus demonstrations are completed.
3.5. Pilot Continuation Training. This section describes the pilot flying continuation training
requirements. Currency and events are found in the RTM.
   3.5.1. Pilots that do not meet currency requirements for Landing Reverse Thrust will be
   considered non-current for this event only and will not become unqualified due to loss of
   currency for this event. These pilots may continue all other duties onboard to include landing
   (without the use of reverse thrust) provided they maintain currency in all other events. Pilots
AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013                                                                     27


   may use reverse thrust as required in an emergency. Pilots may regain currency by
   demonstrating proficiency to an instructor.
   3.5.2. Pilots will fly a sortie at least once each 90 days in each aircraft configuration or
   major modification in which they are certified or qualified (1 sortie every 90 days in TF-33,
   PACER CRAG and RIVET GLASS, if so certified). Pilot transition currencies and pilot
   receiver air refueling currencies can be logged in any -135 MDS, but must be flown under IP
   supervision if the individual is not current or qualified/certified in that aircraft model or
   configuration. Pilots will comply with all other currency requirements for each aircraft. See
   Chapter 1 for more information on MDS/model aircraft definitions.
   3.5.3. Instructor pilots must have direct access to the controls of the aircraft or ATD to dual-
   log a training event.
   3.5.4. Instructor pilots may credit a takeoff if they are in the opposite pilot/copilot seat
   supervising the takeoff.
3.6. Navigator Continuation Training. This section describes the navigator flying
continuation training requirements. Currency and events are found in the RTM. For the purpose
of this instruction, the term navigator will be the generic term implying that the guidance is
applicable to both navigators and CSOs. Specific guidance will be listed as an exception.
   3.6.1. Navigator air refueling currencies can be logged in any -135 MDS in which they are
   qualified.
   3.6.2. Navigators maintaining multiple mission qualifications/certifications must complete
   all currency requirements in their primary aircraft and, as a minimum, currencies specific to
   the secondary aircraft and those events determined by the SQ/CC. ARMS will track all
   currencies.
3.7. Electronic Warfare Officer Continuation Training. Currency and events are found in
the RTM.
3.8. Airborne Systems Engineer Continuation Training. Currency and events are found in
the RTM.
3.9. Cryptologic Mission Crew Continuation Training. Currency and events are found in the
RTM.
3.10. Information Integration Officer Continuation Training. Currency and events are
found in the RTM.
3.11. Special Equipment Operator Continuation Training. Currency and events are found in
the RTM.
3.12. Flight Surgeon Continuation Training. Currency and events are found in the RTM.
3.13. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) Requirements.
   3.13.1. Instrument (pilot only) and Qualification Evaluation(s) IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 2,
   and AFI 11-2RC-135 Volume 2.
   3.13.2. All BAQ flight and ground currencies IAW aircrew specific tables in the RTM.
 28                                                         AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013


       3.13.2.1. BAQ pilot members will fly a supervised sortie with an instructor at least once
       every 60-calendar days.
   3.13.3. Aircrew remaining in BAQ status longer than 6 months will be grounded (removed
   from flying), unless waived by ACC/A3. Exception: This does not apply to crewmembers
   that are on extended BAQ status due to lack of security clearance, extended DNIF or senior
   officers.
   3.13.4. Authorized BAQ aircrew will perform all flight duties under instructor supervision
   unless authorized by SQ/CC or DO to fly local training sorties unsupervised IAW
   paragraph 1.4.2.
3.14. Basic Mission Capable (BMC) Requirements.
   3.14.1. Instrument (pilots only) and Qualification/Mission Evaluation(s) IAW AFI 11-202
   Volume 2 and AFI 11-2RC-135 Volume 2.
   3.14.2. All BMC flight and ground currencies IAW aircrew specific tables in the RTM.
   3.14.3. The SQ/CC may direct BMC crewmembers increase flight requirements depending
   on actual flight duties these crewmembers are required to perform, their -135 experience, and
   proficiency.
   3.14.4. Complete squadron developed flight/ground training programs for spin-up prior to
   participation in exercises, deployments or combat missions as required by the SQ/CC.
   3.14.5. Sortie rate (lookback). See Table 1.2 (N/A API-8/D above the wing level).
3.15. Combat Mission Ready (CMR) Requirements.
   3.15.1. Instrument (pilots only) and Qualification/Mission Evaluation(s) IAW AFI 11-202
   Volume 2 and AFI 11-2RC-135 Volume 2.
   3.15.2. All CMR flight and ground currencies IAW aircrew specific tables in the RTM.
   3.15.3. Complete squadron developed flight/ground training programs for spin-up prior to
   participation in exercises, deployments or combat missions as required by the SQ/CC.
   3.15.4. Sortie rate (lookback). See Table 1.2 (N/A API-8/D above the wing level).
3.16. Special Categories.
   3.16.1. Above wing level staff API-8/D aircrew members may be attached to 55 WG flying
   squadrons IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM guidance.
       3.16.1.1. Mission directed training (MDT) for HHQ personnel (other than that conducted
       in support of a formal inspection) requires coordination with the supporting unit.
       MAJCOM directors (division chiefs for flight safety and IG) and NAF/OV are the
       reviewing authorities for assigned personnel. They will:
          3.16.1.1.1. Coordinate with the supporting agency to ensure appropriate ARMS data
          is maintained and provided IAW AFI 11-401.
          3.16.1.1.2. Review API-8/D crewmember accomplishments and currencies prior to
          authorizing crewmembers to participate in MDT.
AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013                                                                      29


           3.16.1.1.3. Provide each API-8/D crewmember with written documentation
           specifying the sortie types and events the crewmember is authorized to fly.
           3.16.1.1.4. API-8/D personnel maintaining BMC status are exempt from academic
           ground training, and special training programs within authorized mission areas.
           Specific currencies will be provided to the host squadron by ACC/A3C to participate
           in squadron scenarios for MDT. API-8/D personnel must complete ground training
           and spin up training as directed by host flying SQ/CC prior to assuming alert duties or
           flying operational missions/deployments as a primary (required) crewmember.
           3.16.1.1.5. API-8/D personnel will be trained to CMR status for the specific
           mission(s) to be performed before deploying in support of RC/OC/WC/TC-135
           operational missions.
       3.16.1.2. Host units will coordinate with the supporting agency to ensure appropriate
       training information is documented in HARMS IAW AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource
       Management, and AFI 11-202 Volume 1.
       3.16.1.3. Aircrew members will:
           3.16.1.3.1. Review accomplishments and currencies for accuracy.
           3.16.1.3.2. Submit qualification/authorization documentation, to include AF Form
           1042, Medical Recommendations for Flying or Special Operational Duty, showing
           current flight medical status, to the supporting SQ/CC or DO prior to flying with that
           squadron.
           3.16.1.3.3. Evaluate the demands of each mission scenario and ensure that their
           ability/proficiency will not be exceeded.
           3.16.1.3.4. Instructor-qualified aircrew members may perform instructor duties with
           the concurrence of the OG/CC if qualified and current for the applicable
           missions/events.
   3.16.2. The flight surgeon will maintain flying rates and requirements IAW AFI 11-202
   Volume 1 and the RTM.
   3.16.3. When all requisites are met, IQT/MQT/RQT graduates may be considered CMR.
   Gaining unit commanders will determine CMR status of newly assigned personnel. Students
   pulled from upgrade training in order to fill temporary operational positions must meet all
   CMR and aircrew requirements for the position they will fill.
3.17. Loss of currency. Crewmembers will not perform a sortie/event they are not current to
perform unless under instructor supervision (direct supervision for pilots in critical phases of
flight). Instructors must be current and qualified in the crew position/sortie/event they supervise.
As a minimum, pilots occupying a crewmember seat will be current for takeoff, landing and air
refueling (if scheduled), unless an IP is occupying the other pilot seat. When EWO loss of
currency is for sortie/RAP sortie only, current and qualified instructor TCs may supervise EWO
crewmembers regaining currency.
   3.17.1. Regaining currency is required whenever a crewmember does not meet the currency
   requirements of this instruction. Training affecting BMC/CMR status will require regression
   to N-BMC/CMR until the appropriate training, specified by SQ/CC and this instruction, is
 30                                                           AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013


   completed. Training identified as not affecting BMC/CMR status does not require regression
   unless it is a grounding event IAW the RTM.
       3.17.1.1. To regain currency in any non-current event, crewmembers will be under the
       direct supervision of a current and qualified instructor possessing the qualification to
       perform the event required.
   3.17.2. Loss of Instructor Status. SQ/CCs will decertify instructors when one of the
   following conditions exists.
       3.17.2.1. They fail a flight check. The instructor must successfully complete a flight
       evaluation IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 2 and AFI 11-2RC-135 Volume 2 to regain
       instructor status.
       3.17.2.2. They fail a qualification, instrument, or mission written examination. Aircrew
       members must successfully re-accomplish the written exam to regain instructor status.
       3.17.2.3. If in the judgment of the SQ/CC the candidate is not capable of performing
       instructor duties.
   3.17.3. SQ/CCs may decertify instructors if they become non-current in an event/sortie that
   causes removal from CMR/BMC status and the SQ/CC deems that loss of currency is of
   sufficient importance to require de-certification. If the SQ/CC does not elect this option, or if
   the instructor becomes non-current in events/sorties that does not require removal from
   CMR/BMC status, then instructor status may be retained. Individual will not instruct the
   event/sortie until the required currency is regained.
3.18. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Policy and Management. The RAP program is a
training system designed to focus training on accomplishing a unit’s wartime or primary
operational tasking(s). RAP training levels are broken down into BMC or CMR. These training
levels are further divided into experienced or non-experienced categories. The aircrew specific
chapters establish the minimum number of RAP sorties and events per training cycle. Non-RAP
requirements are in addition to RAP requirements. Non-RAP requirements ensure basic aircrew
skills, necessary to operate in the civil airspace environment safely, are maintained.
   3.18.1. SQ/CC will determine, assign, and certify aircrew that will train for and maintain
   special certifications or qualifications. Specialized training is normally accomplished in
   addition to CMR/BMC sortie/event requirements.
   3.18.2. The SQ/CC’s first training priority is to maintain CMR designated aircrew
   proficiency. The second training priority is other continuation training.
   3.18.3. Aircrew experience levels determine how much flying and simulator training is
   required. The two experience levels are “non-experienced” and “experienced”.
   3.18.4. “Non-experienced” identifies aircrew members who require additional training based
   on their experience to maintain CMR or BMC status.
   3.18.5. “Experienced” identifies aircrew members who have demonstrated increased
   proficiency. Experienced aircrew members require less training to maintain CMR or BMC
   status.
   3.18.6. Aircrew members are normally classified as “non-experienced” when initially
   certified BMC/CMR by the SQ/CC. SQ/CC may reclassify aircrew members as
AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013                                                                   31


   “experienced” when they meet minimum progression criteria and SQ/CC determines that
   they can maintain sufficient proficiency while training at the reduced rates. Squadron DOT
   will inform Stan/Eval and SARMs of this progression through the use of AF Form 4324,
   Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification Worksheet. Squadron Stan/Eval will annotate
   experience levels in the “letter of Xs”. See Table 1.3 for the minimum experience level and
   progression requirements.
   3.18.7. Progression from BMC to CMR requires:
       3.18.7.1. A 1-month lookback at the higher sortie rate.
       3.18.7.2. Qualification in all missions and specialized mission training required at CMR.
       3.18.7.3. Confirmation that the aircrew member can complete the prorated number of
       sortie/event requirements remaining for CMR by the end of the training cycle.
       3.18.7.4. Completion of mission-related ground training.
   3.18.8. An effective RAP training sortie requires accomplishing a tactical mission profile or
   a building-block type sortie. Each profile or sortie requires successfully completing at least
   one of the RAP events applicable to that sortie type, as defined by the aircrew specific
   chapter in this instruction. The OG/CC may designate the proportion of RAP events required
   for each platform's authorized missions based on current combatant commander requirements
   or taskings.
   3.18.9. The total number of RAP sorties is the primary factor for maintaining an individual’s
   proficiency and training level. The breakout of sortie/mission types is provided as a
   guideline, minor variances are authorized. Variations may be used as a basis for regression
   by the SQ/CC. Certification in a mission is determined by the SQ/CC considering MAJCOM
   guidance and the individual’s capabilities.
3.19. RAP Monthly and 3-Month Lookback and Regression. RAP mission/sortie
requirements apply to CMR and BMC crewmembers. Table 1.2 establishes the minimum
number of sorties per training cycle for BMC/CMR levels of training. Simulators and power on
aircraft may be used to update RAP provided training objectives can be met as determined by the
SQ/CC.
   3.19.1. SQ/CCs ensure lookback computations are performed the first duty day of every
   month. Lookback computations begin following MQT and the aircrew must maintain a 1-
   month lookback sortie rate until 3-month lookback is established. In addition, the 1-month
   lookback will start the first full month of CMR/BMC status.
   3.19.2. CMR and BMC aircrew members will fly the required monthly sortie rate. Lookback
   does not apply to BAQ aircrew members or API 8/D flyers above the wing. End-of-cycle
   training requirements are based on the crewmember’s experience level on the last day of the
   current training cycle.
   3.19.3. Failure to meet 1-month lookback requires a review of the crewmember’s 3-month
   sortie history. If the 3-month lookback is met the crewmember may remain BMC/CMR.
       3.19.3.1. Failure to meet the 3-month lookback will result in SQ/CCs placing a
       crewmember on either RAP probation or regression. An example of an appropriate use of
       probation is when crewmembers fail lookback due to an operational staff TDY or non-
32                                                          AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013


     availability of the assigned primary aircraft. Probation is limited to one month following
     the date the crewmember failed the 3-month lookback requirement. See Figure 3.1 for
     more information on regression.
        3.19.3.1.1. If RAP requirements are not met at the end of the probation period the
        crewmember will be regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC status or
        3.19.3.1.2. Remove the crewmember from a CMR manning position or
        3.19.3.1.3. Initiate action to remove the crewmember from active flying status.
     3.19.3.2. Crewmembers regressed to N-BMC/CMR for lookback for less than 180 days
     will complete a SQ/CC approved program to return the crewmember to BMC/CMR
     status. BMC/CMR aircrew must meet the subsequent 1-month lookback requirement
     prior to reclaiming BMC/CMR status upon completion of the SQ/CC directed program.
     The sorties and events accomplished during the program may be credited towards their
     total/type sortie and event requirements for the training cycle as well as for their monthly
     sortie requirements.
     3.19.3.3. Crewmembers regressed to N-BMC/CMR beyond 181 days will accomplish a
     flight evaluation using a standard RAP profile or an appropriate certification of the event
     that caused the regression.
AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013                                                                       33


Figure 3.1. Regression Flow Chart.




3.20. Failure to Meet End-of-Cycle Training Requirements. Aircrew who fail to complete
both RAP and non-RAP event requirements by the end of the training cycle will accomplish
training at the direction of the SQ/CC. Report all training shortfalls IAW paragraph 1.2.3.11.
   3.20.1. Failure to meet sortie and/or event requirements for BAQ results in supervised status
   until successful training is accomplished, as determined by the SQ/CC.
   3.20.2. Failure to accomplish sorties required for special certifications/qualifications will
   result in loss of that certification/qualification. The SQ/CC will determine
   recertification/requalification requirements.
3.21. Proration of end-of-cycle requirements. The SQ/CC may prorate all training
requirements when DNIFs, emergency leaves, non-flying TDY, exercises, and lack of aircraft
preclude continuation training for a portion of the training period at the end of the training cycle.
Normal annual leave will not be considered as non-availability. Extended bad weather, which
 34                                                            AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013


precludes the unit from flying for more than 15 consecutive days, may be considered as non-
availability. The following guidelines apply:
   3.21.1. Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-
   availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies.
   3.21.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying during the
   training cycle. Use Table 3.1 to determine the number of months to be prorated based on
   cumulative calendar days of non-availability. For example, Capt Jones was granted 17 days
   of emergency leave in January and attended SOS in residence from March through April for
   56 consecutive calendar days. His SQ/CC authorized a total of three months proration from
   his training cycle (one month for emergency leave and two months for SOS).
   3.21.3. A crewmember’s training cycle will start over at a prorated share following
   completion of training if initial mission qualification training is re-accomplished.
   3.21.4. Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the next
   lower whole number, but no requirement may be prorated below one.
   3.21.5. For initial/requalification training, the newly assigned crewmembers will be prorated
   upon achieving BMC/CMR status. If this occurs after the 15th of the month begin tracking
   continuation training for proration on the first day of the following month.
   3.21.6. An aircrew member’s last month on station prior to departing on a PCS may be
   prorated. Departing crewmembers may be considered CMR for reporting purposes up to 60
   days from date of their last flight, or until loss of CMR currency, port call date, or sign-in at a
   new duty station, whichever occurs first.
   3.21.7. CMR aircrew members who attend US Air Force Weapons School in TDY-and-
   return status may be reported throughout the TDY as CMR. These aircrew members will
   accomplish a prorated share of sortie/event requirements IAW Table 3.1 upon returning to
   home station.
   3.21.8. Operational missions (including contingency missions) can have a positive or
   negative impact on a unit’s continuation training program. A potential lack of training
   opportunities, while deployed, can place a burden on the unit forcing it to accomplish the
   majority of its continuation training program in a reduced period of time at home station. The
   preceding procedures are intended to provide flexibility in accomplishing the unit’s
   continuation training program.
      3.21.8.1. Operational/contingency sorties that provide valid RAP training, based on the
      definition of a RAP sortie in this instruction, are to be logged as RAP sorties/events while
      deployed. Events accomplished on these sorties count toward RAP event requirements,
      and these sorties/events may not be prorated upon return to home station.

3.22. Aircrew Training Devices (ATD).
   3.22.1. Simulator training in ATDs such as the OFT/RJMT/MCTS/ground power trainers
   augments flight training. The OG/CC will determine which events are creditable and may
   update currencies in these ATDs based upon SIMCERT results and recommendations from
   55 OSS/OST. The OG/CC may also place limitations on how many events may be credited
   or how often currencies may be updated in each ATD. 55 OSS/OST will maintain a master
   list of these creditable flight training and currency events.
   3.22.2. Because of the wide range of conditions and medications, the flight surgeon will
   need to determine whether an individual can perform OFT duties, when placing the
   individual on DNIF status.
   3.22.3. The required recurring simulator training events for BMC, CMR, and BAQ aircrew
   members are listed in the RTM for specific crewmembers. Not applicable to API-8 and
   General Officer/General Officer-select BAQ aircrew.

                        INSTRUCTOR AND UPGRADE TRAINING

4.1. General. This chapter contains information for instructor and upgrade training. Instructor
and upgrade training are in-house/base proper DQTs and will not incur an ADSC.
4.2. Instructor Upgrade Training. SQ/CCs will personally review each instructor candidate’s
qualifications to ensure the individual possesses skills necessary to upgrade to instructor.
Instructor candidates must be considered Experienced as listed in Table 1.3 and meet the hour
requirements listed in Table 4.1.
   4.2.1. The Central Flight Instructor Course (CFIC). CFIC prepares unit aircrew for flight
   instructor qualification. CFIC attendance is a prerequisite for flight instructor status.
   Prerequisites and time limitations are listed in the ETCA, the CFIC syllabus and this
   instruction. Table 4.1 below outlines the hour requirements for initial upgrade to instructor.
   Instructor requalification events may be accomplished with basic requalification events.

 Notes:
 1. The OG/CC may waive the minimum flying hour requirements for instructor upgrade.
 2. Total flying time is career military flying time logged in the crew position the individual will
 upgrade in. Time includes “student” time but does NOT include time logged in the simulator or
 “other” time.
 3. SQ/CC Nomination required
 4. Instructors who qualify in a new position will be qualified in that position for a SQ/CC-
 determined time period before performing instructor duties in that position(i.e., an ASE 4 who
AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013                                                                    37


qualifies to ASE 1 will not be an IASE1 until the SQ/CC time limit has been met). Instructor
upgrade requires Experienced designation as outlined in paragraph 1.7.2.
5. Requires minimum of 1-year as CMR and SQ/CC nomination.
6. Instructors who upgrade or change positions will be qualified in that position for 12 months
and have a minimum of 300 flight hours in that position before performing instructor duties in
that position, i.e. an ICO who upgrades to AA will not be an IAA until qualified as an AA for
12 months and gaining 300 hours in the AA position.
7. Requires minimum of 1-year as a CMR ready SEO.
8. Commander, AFTAC/Det 1 may waive the minimum flying hour requirements for instructor
upgrade
  4.2.2. The FTU is responsible for ensuring the initial instructor training is completed. Failure
  to complete an initial instructor evaluation for any reason requires appropriate action IAW
  AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Aviation Badges,
  and AFI 11-202 Volume 2.
  4.2.3. The instructor course is designed to teach selected crewmembers fundamentals and
  concepts of instructing. Instructor candidates will be selected based on experience, judgment,
  flying skill, and technical knowledge.
  4.2.4. Individuals who previously attended a formal MAJCOM flight instructor course and
  meet the minimum flying hour requirements may upgrade to an RC/OC/WC/TC-135
  instructor in-unit with OG/CC approval.
  4.2.5. Academic training course must be satisfactorily completed prior to any flight training
  being accomplished. Training areas must include, but are not limited to the following:
      4.2.5.1. Applicable regulations/flight manuals.
      4.2.5.2. Emergency procedures.
      4.2.5.3. Systems knowledge.
      4.2.5.4. Flight training.
      4.2.5.5. Instructor techniques.
      4.2.5.6. Academic instruction.
      4.2.5.7. Instructor evaluation.
  4.2.6. Units should forward the names of instructor candidates to the 338 CTS/CCR to fill
  allocated training quotas no later than 30 days prior to class start date.
  4.2.7. Instructor candidates must arrive at CFIC current and qualified in their unit assigned
  aircraft. Units are required to provide pre-CFIC SIM and/or flight training to candidates prior
  to school attendance. This training is dictated in the formal course syllabus. The SQ/CC or
  their representative certifies completion of the prerequisites. Failure to complete the flights
  without an OG/CC waiver will result in the candidate being returned to the unit before
  training begins. The individual may continue to log continuation training events during pre-
  CFIC training.
  4.2.8. CFIC students will contact the 338 CTS for a list of all required publications for
  instructor upgrade training prior to attending the CFIC course.
 38                                                           AFI11-2RC-135V1 20 MAY 2013


   4.2.9. Multiple simulated emergencies may be required during CFIC flight training. The
   intent of these maneuvers is to broaden a candidate’s experience base and will only be
   accomplished at CFIC. These maneuvers must be approved by HQ ACC/A3C.
   4.2.10. The training standards of CFIC exceed the AF standards for non-instructor courses.
   If an instructor upgrade student experiences difficulties in an instructor upgrade course where
   the problem specifically concerns the students’ lack of instructional ability rather than a lack
   of proficiency, the 338 CTS/CC may recommend, with OG/CC approval, suspension or
   disenrollment provided the member meets basic and mission qualification standards.
      4.2.10.1. Candidates that are suspended will return to their squadron for additional
      training. The suspended candidate’s SQ/CC will determine what additional training is
      required. Upon completion of additional training, the suspended candidate’s SQ/CC will
      recommend to 338 CTS/CC re-enrollment into CFIC, disenrollment from CFIC, FEB
      Waiver or FEB.
      4.2.10.2. Candidates that are disenrolled will be sent back to their respective squadron to
      fly as a non-instructor aircrew member.
   4.2.11. CFIC Graduation. The FTU will submit a final training report to the unit at the
   completion of CFIC. The training report will summarize the student’s overall performance
   concluding with a recommendation to either upgrade, or not to upgrade the student to
   instructor and proceed with remedial training or initiate a FEB/AEB.
4.3. Aircraft Commander Upgrade Training.
   4.3.1. Pilot Upgrade Program (PUP) is a formal training course for RC/OC/WC/TC-135
   copilots upgrading to aircraft commander. Formal school attendance in the 338 CTS is the
   primary method for AC qualification training. In-unit upgrade using courseware provided by
   the formal school is the secondary method. In-unit AC upgrade flight training will be
   accomplished only when formal school upgrade quotas are not available and ACC/A3C
   waiver has been granted.
   4.3.2. Individuals selected for PUP training may occupy the left seat under direct IP
   supervision to perform orientation or SQ/CC directed pre-PUP training events as applicable.
   Document all PUP qualification training in the individual’s training folder. Table 4.2
   outlines the requisites to upgrade from a Co-Pilot or other MDS Aircraft Commander (AC) to
   RC/OC/WC/TC-135 AC.

 or RPA flight time. No more than 200 hours of "other" time may be counted.

 2. Total flying time does not include “student”, “other” and “sim” time.

 3. Other MDS pilots must have previously been qualified as an A/C or IP. Other MDS Co-
 pilots must have at least 300 hours -135 time to be nominated by SQ/CC.
4.4. Tactical Coordinator (TC) Upgrade Training. Units will designate candidates for TC
upgrade/qualification. Training will consist of both academic and flight phases IAW the formal
syllabus. Table 4.3 lists the flying time required for TC upgrade.

 NOTE: MDS time is primary/instructor/evaluator time on the specific RC-135 (RJ, CB, CS)
 for which TC qualification is sought.
4.5. ASE Multiple Position Qualification Training.
   4.5.1. Multiple Position Qualification is defined as qualification on multiple positions of the
   same mission series (M/S). For example, an ASE 4 on the RC-135V/W obtaining a
   qualification as an ASE 2 on the RC-135V/W.
       4.5.1.1. Training requires attendance of a formal course. This course must be taught by
       an FTC instructor either at the 338 CTS or in-unit utilizing the approved syllabus.
       4.5.1.2. Prerequisite for obtaining a multiple position qualification is 500 hours total RC-
       135 flying time and SQ/CC approval. Flying time is defined as time flown in the last
       crew position qualified in. This includes “student time”.
   4.5.2. Multiple qualifications onboard multiple M/S require OG/CC approval and IQT/RQT.
   Exception: The ASE 1 position onboard the RC-135S and the ASE 3 position onboard the
   RC-135U are to be considered the same M/S and follow guidance in paragraph 4.5.1.
   4.5.3. Difference training between platforms will be IAW paragraph 2.8.1.6.
4.6. AMS/AA/DLO Upgrade Training.
   4.6.1. Units will designate candidates for AMS/AA/DLO upgrade. Training will consist of
