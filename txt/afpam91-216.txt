This directive implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 91-2, Safety Program. This
pamphlet is an aggregate of many documents, deployment guides, technical orders (TO), Air
Force Instructions (AFI), Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) standards and
others. This pamphlet is not intended to replace any existing document or the mandatory
compliance with any document. Compliance with this pamphlet is not mandatory. It is intended
to assist commanders, commander’s representatives, planners, supervisors, and all personnel
concerned with the safety and health of Air Force resources. Safety and health professionals
involved with preventing mishaps and evaluating and mitigating risks associated with all phases
of deployments and contingencies are certainly encouraged to use this guidance. Information
included in this pamphlet is also intended to provide some insight to deployed operations and
conditions. Losses on any future contingency are preventable through the application of sound
Operational Risk Management (ORM) principles when making informed decisions; establishing
and enforcing high standards of performance; creating a conscientious command climate, and
recognizing the effects of stress and fatigue on human performance. Mishap prevention is an
important weapon in our arsenal and this pamphlet is a quick reference guide intended to help
prevent mishaps during contingency operations and to multiply combat resources through asset
preservation. Much of the information presented, is also intended to prepare for deployment,
those individuals tasked with mishap prevention and occupational safety and health program
responsibilities associated with deployment and contingency operations.

Major commands (MAJCOM), direct reporting units (DRU), and field operating agencies (FOA)
may supplement this pamphlet as needed. Send comments and suggested improvements to
Headquarters Air Force Safety Center, Ground Safety Division, Safety Engineering and
Standards Branch (HQ AFSC/ SEGS), 9700 G Avenue, SE, Suite 222, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-
5670, on Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.

The ability of a unit to conduct a successful safe operation through all phases of preparation,
deployment, employment, and redeployment depends on the adequacy of individual staff
planning and training efforts. Operation Plans (OPLAN) should be studied to determine
deployment configurations and mission support requirements. Each annex to the Installation
Deployment Plan (IDP) should be tailored to support specific requirements or concept of
operation needs. Thorough and complete deployment planning is essential and can be realized
through quality review, base exercises, and commanders and staff agencies evaluations. Process
ownership belongs to the host unit and (or) deployment commander and they should ensure local
deployment guidance defines the process and procedures necessary to deploy forces.

No TO, AFI, AFOSH standard, operating instruction, or pamphlet can possibly address every
hazard or potential hazard that may arise from a specific task or combination of tasks. Where
situations exist that do not appear to be adequately covered by existing directives, use an ORM
process to assess risk associated with those situations and determine adequate safeguards or
procedures to manage the risk. NOTE: The ORM process may not be used to violate directives
or other regulatory guidance. Normal waiver or variance procedures must be followed in all
cases.

                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. Safety Planning in Contingency Operations. Safety planning and Operational Risk
Management (ORM) can prevent the accidental destruction or loss of aerospace forces used to
carry out an assigned mission. The planner must recognize necessary planning variations in
wartime, be fully aware of the commander’s analysis of the mission, and make plans that
promote mission objectives safely.
     1.1.1. Time, location, facilities, environmental conditions, equipment, and mission urgency
     can make it necessary to accept certain hazards and risks to achieve the necessary objectives.
     1.1.2. Safety standards and programs must be considered during mission planning. Certain
     missions may, however, require acceptance of unavoidable risks to reach primary mission
     objectives. However, ORM may not be used to violate or circumvent standards or
     requirements. As part of ORM, prior to acceptance of any risk, ensure risk decisions are
     made at the appropriate level.
     1.1.3. The acceptance of hazards or risks under certain conditions does not mean they should
     be allowed to become operational norms. When full safety compliance cannot be maintained,
     every available and practical measure must be applied to reduce or control the risk.
     1.1.4. When the need for noncompliance no longer exists, standard safety procedures must
     be reestablished. When risks or hazards are accepted, all personnel involved in the operation
     should be completely informed of what these conditions are, why they exist, what adverse
     effects they may create, and controls implemented to minimize as much risk as possible.
1.2. Mission Analysis. It is important to review as many aspects of the deployment or
contingency as possible. A thorough analysis prior to departure may facilitate correction of many
issues before they become problems. Failure to advise commanders and mission planners of
potential problems could result in an unnecessary mishap. To prevent individuals from
abandoning safety in an effort to accomplish the mission:
     1.2.1. Ensure all personnel know, use, and apply the six-step Operational Risk-Management
     process to all operations.
     1.2.2. Establish a command climate from the outset that promotes safety. Begin by
     establishing a safety network, designating safety personnel.
     1.2.3. Establish and enforce standards; require all personnel to perform to standard in all
     operations.
     1.2.4. Areas that impact the conduct of safe operations can be examined before deployment.
     These may include:
        1.2.4.1. Billeting. Finalize arrangements before departure and ensure they provide for
        adequate crew rest.
        1.2.4.2. Medical. Identify all medical facilities and personnel. Medical personnel should
        identify potable water sources, approved food sources, and precautions to protect
        personnel against local health threats. Ensure plans are made to provide personnel with
        required immunizations prior to mobility processing. Identify deploying medical
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                      9


     personnel and ensure they can be quickly located. A pre-deployment medical force
     protection briefing should be accomplished prior to departure.
     1.2.4.3. Transportation. Ensure controls for flight line access and control of vehicles,
     rental cars, etc., are arranged before departure. Evaluate local driving rules, regulations,
     and road conditions to identify significant factors that may impact personnel or vehicles.
     NOTE:          A         HQ       AFSC/SEG           website        is       located      at
     http://safety.kirtland.af.mil/AFSC/RDBMS/Ground/new_page_1.htm#local that lists
     several overseas locations local driving conditions and traffic safety briefs.
     1.2.4.4. Off-Duty Hazards. Research and identify local conditions, laws, hazards, driving
     conditions, etc., and make arrangements to brief deploying personnel prior to departure or
     immediately upon their arrival at the deployed location. (See Attachment 2.)
     1.2.4.5. Fire Protection. Maintenance personnel should be prepared to bring fire
     extinguishers for flight line use. Ensure ―Tent City‖ fire extinguishers and smoke
     detectors (one each for each tent) are not overlooked and that they work prior to home
     station departure. If detectors are battery operated include appropriate sized batteries.
     Ensure fire fighting and rescue capabilities meet established criteria outlined in the War
     and Mobilization Plan, Volume 1, Annex S, Appendix 5.
     1.2.4.6. Climate and Weather. Ensure expected weather conditions are briefed to
     deploying personnel so that they can plan accordingly. Issue of appropriate uniform
     clothing for the deployed climate and current weather conditions should be accomplished
     or arranged. Issue of appropriate supplies, such as sunscreen or insect repellent should
     also be considered and arranged. (See Chapter 12)
     1.2.4.7. Explosives Safety. Provide written procedures for all phases of munitions
     operations at deployed locations. Ensure explosive site plans are available. (See Chapter
     9.)
     1.2.4.8. Flammables and Combustibles:
        1.2.4.8.1. Emphasize the need for spill control. Remind personnel to remove
        contaminated soil from operational areas at once because there may be extreme fire
        and vapor hazards in hot, dry conditions. Personnel involved in any type of spill
        clean-up or disposition of contaminated materials will be provided with necessary
        PPE.
        1.2.4.8.2. Protect flammables (flashpoint less than 100 degrees Fahrenheit [F]) and
        combustibles (flashpoint 100 degrees F or greater) from extreme heat exposure.
     1.2.4.9. Environmental Considerations. Hazardous waste areas and hazardous materials
     operations can threaten the environment and personnel. Plans developed should include
     procedures for handling the accumulation, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. This
     may also require additional materials at deployed locations. Spill kits, approved
     transportable containers for waste materials and plans to execute cleanup projects must be
     considered. Hazardous material spills must be cleaned up to the point that contamination
     poses no imminent and substantial danger to human health or safety. Environmental
     safeguards must also be accounted for while considering operational needs.

                     OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT (ORM)

2.1. Introduction to Operational Risk Management:
   2.1.1. The ultimate objective for any Air Force organization is maximizing combat
   capability. Important elements of this objective include protecting our personnel and
   conserving combat weapon systems and their support equipment. Preventing mishaps and
   reducing losses is an important aspect of conserving these resources. ORM contributes to
   mishap prevention, and therefore to combat capability, by minimizing risks due to hazards
   consistent with other cost, schedule, and mission requirements. The fundamental goal of
   ORM is to enhance mission effectiveness at all levels while preserving assets and
   safeguarding the health and welfare of personnel. Beyond reducing losses, ORM also
   provides a logical process to identify and exploit opportunities that provide the greatest
   return on our investment of time, dollars, and personnel.
   2.1.2. Accomplishing the mission includes managing risk affecting people and resources.
   Attempt to analyze and anticipate as many hazards as possible before deployment. This
   pamphlet by itself is not a complete ORM program. It will highlight the most hazardous
   functional areas and give insight to hazards previously experienced during other contingency
   operations.
   2.1.3. Risk is the potential for mission degradation or failure, injury, damage, or loss, and is
   present in everything we do. It is measured by several factors including the potential severity
   and the probability of occurrence. Hazards are conditions that have the potential to negatively
   impact the mission and (or) cause injury, damage, or loss. To manage risk, identify potential
   hazards, then, take the steps necessary to prioritize the potential hazards using a Risk
   Assessment Code (RAC) priority system. Time may not allow elimination of all hazards,
   thus, the importance of priorities. An active risk assessment culture will help the deploying
   force alter mishap possibilities. Situational awareness needs to be based on an accurate
   perception and include all probable options. A risk decision should reflect controls
   guaranteeing the minimum risk necessary for mission accomplishment.
   2.1.4. All United States (US) Air Force missions and daily routines involve risk. All
   operations require decisions that include risk assessment as well as ORM. Each commander
   and supervisor, along with every individual, is responsible for identifying potential risks and
   adjusting or compensating appropriately. Risk decisions must be made at a level of
   responsibility that corresponds to the degree of risk, taking into consideration the
   significance of the mission and the timeliness of the required decision. Risk should be
   identified using the same disciplined, organized, and logical thought-processes that govern
   all other aspects of military endeavors. The US Air Force aim is to increase mission success
   while reducing the risk to personnel and resources to the lowest practical level.
   2.1.5. ORM is the process used by decision-makers to reduce or offset risk. The ORM
   process provides leaders and individuals a systematic mechanism to identify and choose the
   optimum course of action for any given situation. ORM must become a fully integrated
   element of planning and executing an operation. The ORM process is applicable to all levels
   of military operations from strategic to tactical. Commanders are responsible for the routine
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                       11


   application of ORM in the planning and execution phases of all missions, whether they are
   combat or support operations.
      2.1.5.1. ORM is a logic-based, common sense approach to making calculated decisions
      on human, material, and environmental factors before, during, and after Air Force
      mission activities and operations. It enables commanders, functional managers,
      supervisors, and individuals to maximize operational capabilities while minimizing risks
      by applying a simple, systematic process appropriate for all personnel and Air Force
      functions. Refer to AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk Management Guidelines and Toos,
      for additional information.
      2.1.5.2. The use of ORM as part of the planning and execution phases of deployment can
      mean the difference in successful mission completion, or not. Using the ORM process for
      identifying and controlling hazards will help commanders reduce their risk during
      planning and execution of deployed operations. Controlling hazards protects the force
      from unnecessary risks. Eliminating unnecessary risks opens the way for audacity in
      execution and preserves combat power.
2.2. Planning:
   2.2.1. Good ORM is crucial to operational readiness and safe mission accomplishment. We
   cannot afford to lose our scarce resources to poor judgment or faulty reasoning. All available
   resources must be applied to mission accomplishment. ORM must be integrated into all
   operations to preserve resources and ensure all forces return safely home.
   2.2.2. People and material are at greater risk while supporting contingencies–whether a
   natural disaster, base-wide exercise, or joint operations at a bare base. It is everyone’s
   responsibility to minimize the hazards, but safety personnel should take a leading role in
   identifying methods, techniques, and procedures that are or could be effective in protecting
   personnel from controllable hazards.
   2.2.3. In most contingency operations, you will have time to prepare your strategy. You
   should pull together a team of risk assessment specialists from the safety, fire, health
   services, and functional managers participating in the contingency. This team will help you
   understand the risks associated with deployed operations to allow you to make the safest
   possible decisions and achieve mission objectives.
   2.2.4. Contingency and exercise manpower is often comprised of augmentees. Although they
   should be trained, they may lack proficiency in diverse mission scenarios.
2.3. Integrating ORM Into Contingency Operations:
   2.3.1. During initial planning stages, perform a risk analysis. Contact personnel from
   ground, flight, and weapons safety, fire, health, environmental, and security agencies to assist
   with the identification of and solutions to contingency hazards. Conduct pre-deployment
   surveys at both home installations and contingency sites to identify and ensure abatement of
   potential hazards before a full-scale deployment. Site surveys may have already been
   performed at some deployment locations. Contact AOR MAJCOM to determine if any
   surveys are already available, if needed obtain copies as appropriate. In addition, inspect all
   facilities, flight line areas, munitions storage areas, and roadways that are going to be used.
   Abatement of identified hazards should begin prior to initiation of actual deployment.
12                                                          AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


  2.3.2. Implement a hazard reporting and hazard abatement program during contingencies.
  Ensure all personnel know how to report hazards immediately to permit timely correction or
  mitigation.
  2.3.3. Be alert that many people may want to deviate from established and proven safety
  practices. This is only acceptable after all risks are considered and appropriate measures are
  implemented to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. Responsible decision-makers must
  weigh the risks and take appropriate measures to prevent unnecessary sacrifices of their
  people and equipment. The possibility of a language, cultural, or military service policy
  difference may exist due to multi-Department of Defense (DoD) components and foreign
  national involvement.
 2.3.4. Establish positive communications within the organizational structure; include other
 services counterparts, and the next higher echelon—this is invaluable to good ORM. This is
 particularly useful during joint operations with other US services or with armed forces of
 other countries.
 2.3.5. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and miscellaneous gear. Lack of available PPE
 is a common problem at deployed locations. Plans should include PPE not only for industrial
 workers, but augmentees as well. Many people will also find it difficult and cumbersome
 working in clothing and other gear that they may be unaccustomed to wearing. For example,
 goggles to protect against blowing sand or heavy cold weather footwear can make operation
 of equipment or vehicles difficult. Make sure personnel understand their new environment
 and take extra precautions when needed. Training in a non-mission environment should be
 conducted to ensure personnel are aware of potential hazards and work-a-rounds while
 wearing PPE.
  2.3.6. Watch for stress. All contingency operations have proven stressful and people under
  stress often make mishap-causing mistakes. Family separation and unfamiliar working and
  living environments can increase stress. These factors are part of military life, but during
  contingency operations they may become insurmountable for some individuals. Symptoms of
  stress might include:
     2.3.6.1. Fatigue not explained by physical activity, i.e., feelings of hopelessness or
     helplessness.
     2.3.6.2. Increased alcohol consumption.
     2.3.6.3. Health-related problems including multiple complaints of minor aches and pains
     and sickness.
     2.3.6.4. Suicidal thoughts or attempts at self harm.
     2.3.6.5. Irritability—people getting angry easily or being overly sensitive to any sort of
     feedback.
     2.3.6.6. Withdrawal—people pulling inside themselves and not seeming to pay any
     attention to what you are saying.
     2.3.6.7. Forgetfulness—short-term memory loss.
     2.3.6.8. Projecting blame—when a person in essence says, ―I only did it because you told
     me to do it, so it’s your fault.‖
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                       13


   2.3.7. To reduce stress to an acceptable level:
      2.3.7.1. Exercise (non-competitive).
      2.3.7.2. Allow people time to walk away when they are upset. This may allow them to
      gain a better perspective upon their return.
      2.3.7.3. Encourage early, open discussion concerning operational problems within the
      supervisory chain; early detection and solution precludes larger problems later.
      2.3.7.4. Encourage discussion regarding any problems.
      2.3.7.5. Promote moderation in all that is done.
   2.3.8. Know what off-duty activities people are planning. Even on contingency operations,
   the majority of Air Force reportable mishaps occur off-duty. Traffic mishaps commonly
   claim the lives of Air Force personnel. Speed, lack of seat belt use, alcohol use, fatigue, and
   unfamiliar or poorly marked roads often contribute to traffic mishaps. Also, encourage
   leaders and supervisors to visit living quarters frequently to ensure quality of life and safety
   issues are addressed. People work better knowing someone is personally concerned about his
   or her welfare. Services personnel can often make sure sports and recreation activities are
   planned and equipment is available. Provide supervision for recreational and sporting
   activities when deemed necessary.
2.4. The ORM Process. ORM is a six-step process:
   2.4.1. Step 1—Identify the Hazards. Hazard can be defined as any real or potential condition
   that can cause mission degradation, injury, illness, or death to personnel, or damage to or loss
   of equipment or property. Factors to consider when identifying hazards:
      2.4.1.1. Time for mission preparation and execution;
      2.4.1.2. Terrain (rough, hills, swamp, etc.);
      2.4.1.3. Extended work hours and probability of fatigue;
      2.4.1.4. Competition for time (training versus safety briefings);
      2.4.1.5. Skill level of personnel;
      2.4.1.6. Operational hazards;
      2.4.1.7. Water hazards;
      2.4.1.8. Road conditions (narrow, congested, curves, hills, etc.);
      2.4.1.9. Communication requirements (between units, joint service);
      2.4.1.10. Weather (existing and forecast);
      2.4.1.11. Equipment condition (age, maintenance, etc.);
      2.4.1.12. Cargo (type, quantity, security);
      2.4.1.13. Hazardous material (fuel, munitions, etc.);
      2.4.1.14. Enemy;

  2.4.2. Step 2—Assess the Risk. Risk is the probability and severity of loss or adverse
  mission impact from exposure to the hazard. Assessment is the application of quantitative or
  qualitative measures to determine all the levels of risk associated with a specific hazard. The
  assessment step in the process defines the probability, severity, and exposure of a mishap that
  could result from the hazard.
  2.4.3. Step 3—Analyze Risk Control Measures. Investigate specific strategies and controls
  that reduce or eliminate risk. Effective control measures reduce one of the three components
  (probability, severity, or exposure) of risk.
 2.4.4. Step 4—Make Control Decisions. Decision makers at the appropriate level choose
 controls based on analysis of overall costs and benefits.
 2.4.5. Step 5—Implement Risk Controls. Once control strategies have been analyzed, an
 implementation strategy needs to be developed and then applied by management and the
 work force. Implementation requires commitment of time and resources.
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                       15


   2.4.6. Step 6—Supervise and Review. ORM is a process that continues throughout the life
   cycle of the system, mission, or activity. Once controls are in place, the process must be
   scrutinized to determine its effectiveness.
2.5. The ORM Rules. This six-step process is governed by four rules:
   2.5.1. Rule 1—Accept no Unnecessary Risk. Unnecessary risk comes without a
   commensurate return in terms of real benefits or available opportunities. All US Air Force
   missions and our daily routines involve risk. All activities require a basic understanding of
   hazards and risks as well as appropriate controls. The most logical choices for accomplishing
   a mission are those that meet all mission requirements while exposing personnel and
   resources to the lowest acceptable risk. ORM provides tools to determine which risk or what
   level of risk is unnecessary. The corollary to this axiom is ―accept necessary risk‖ required to
   successfully complete the mission or task. As an example, choosing the lowest threat ingress
   to a target versus the most direct route avoids unnecessary risk.
   2.5.2. Rule 2—Make Risk Decisions at the Appropriate Level. Making risk decisions at the
   appropriate level establishes clear accountability. Those accountable for the success or failure
   of the mission must be included in the risk decision process. Anyone can make a risk
   decision; however, the appropriate level for risk decisions is the one that can allocate the
   resources to reduce the risk or eliminate the hazard and implement controls. Commanders at
   all levels must ensure subordinates know how much risk they can accept and when they must
   elevate the decision to a higher level. Typically, the commander, leader, or individual
   responsible for executing the mission or task is:
       2.5.2.1. Authorized to accept levels of risk typical of the planned operation (i.e., loss of
       mission effectiveness, normal wear and tear on material).
       2.5.2.2. Required to elevate decisions to the next level in the chain of command after it is
       determined that controls available to him or her will not reduce residual risk to an
       acceptable level.
   2.5.3. Rule 3—Accept Risk When Benefits Outweigh the Costs. All identified benefits
   should be compared to all identified costs. The process of weighing risks against
   opportunities and benefits helps to maximize unit capability. Even high-risk endeavors may
   be undertaken when there is clear knowledge that the sum of the benefits exceeds the sum of
   the costs. Balancing costs and benefits may be a subjective process and open to
   interpretation. Ultimately, the balance may have to be determined by the appropriate decision
   authority.
   2.5.4. Rule 4—Integrate ORM into Air Force Doctrine and Planning at all Levels. To
   effectively apply ORM, commanders must dedicate time and resources to incorporate ORM
   principles into the planning processes. Risks are more easily assessed and managed in the
   planning stages of an operation. Integrating ORM into planning as early as possible provides
   the decision maker the greatest opportunity to apply ORM principles. Additionally, feedback
   must be provided to benefit future missions and activities.
2.6. ORM Responsibilities:
   2.6.1. Commanders:
       2.6.1.1. Are responsible for effective management of risk.
 16                                                              AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


       2.6.1.2. Select from risk reduction options provided by the staff.
       2.6.1.3. Accept or reject risk based on the benefit to be derived.
       2.6.1.4. Train and motivate leaders to use ORM.
       2.6.1.5. If not authorized to accept high level risks, elevate to the appropriate level.
   2.6.2. Staff:
       2.6.2.1. Assess risks and develop risk reduction options.
       2.6.2.2. Integrate risk controls into plans and orders.
       2.6.2.3. Identify unnecessary risk controls.
   2.6.3. Supervisors:
       2.6.3.1. Apply the ORM process and direct personnel to use it both on- and off-duty.
       2.6.3.2. Consistently apply effective ORM concepts and methods to operations and tasks.
       2.6.3.3. Elevate risk issues beyond their control or authority to superiors for resolution.
   2.6.4. Individuals:
       2.6.4.1. Understand, accept, and implement ORM processes.
       2.6.4.2. Maintain a constant awareness of the changing risks associated with the
       operation or task.
       2.6.4.3. Make supervisors immediately aware of any unrealistic risk reduction measures
       or high-risk procedures.
2.7. Risk Assessment. Combine the severity and probability estimates to form an assessment
for each risk. The Operational Risk Assessment Matrix forms the basis for judging both the
acceptability of a risk and the management level at which the decision on acceptability will be
made. Use Table 2.1 to combine severity and probability estimates for each hazard identified
during ORM Step 1.

2.8. Examples Of Control Measures For Hazards Involved In Deployment Operations:
   2.8.1. Hazard—Inadequate Fire Protection:
      2.8.1.1. Coordinate with local fire departments for coverage.
      2.8.1.2. Optimize use of available extinguishers.
      2.8.1.3. Ensure firefighters are aware of the types of hazardous materials being loaded so
      they can be prepared with the proper extinguishing equipment and materials.
   2.8.2. Hazard—Material-Handling Equipment:
      2.8.2.1. Identify and use trained and certified personnel.
      2.8.2.2. Train and certify additional operators for long-term operations.
   2.8.3. Hazard—Lack of proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):
      2.8.3.1. Ensure leather work gloves are provided during movement of equipment.
      2.8.3.2. Obtain proper eye protection as required.
2.9. Pre-Deployment Considerations:
   2.9.1. Review the deployment plan. Concept of operation, personnel, safety annex, and
   limiting factors (LIMFACS) are of primary importance.
   2.9.2. Ensure an Operational Risk Analysis was accomplished by deployment planners and
   approved by the deploying commander.
   2.9.3. If deploying to an established location confer with the previous deployment safety
   officer or non-commissioned officer (NCO) for updated information. This may require
   calling the safety office of the last unit deployed. If at all possible, call the person you are
18                                                           AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


  replacing while they are still at the deployed location. An overlap of personnel is not always
  afforded to the deploying person.
  2.9.4. Get visibly involved in pre-deployment planning to include personnel, maintenance,
  LIMFACS, required simulator training, aircrew currencies, explosive site plans etc.
  Explosive site planning or contingency risk assessment must be accomplished prior to
  deployment (see AFMAN 91-201 para 1.4 Planning for Deployments). Once munitions
  arrive, it is too late. Determine other required safety personnel and get them involved in the
  planning process.
  2.9.5. If explosives or missiles will be involved, ensure personnel who will handle them
  have received explosives or missile safety training and are properly qualified. MAJCOMs
  must ensure adequate explosives safety support is available at the deployment location during
  planning and beddown. The weapons representative should come from the service retaining
  overall safety responsibility at the joint location. Consider the differences in operations that
  may arise.
  2.9.6. Examples of violations during loading and shipment include: failure to identify and
  mark containers; mixing incompatible munitions; corrosives improperly certified and mixed
  with unidentified hazardous lubricants; meals ready to eat (MRE) and undocumented
  insecticides on the same pallet; improper storage; and improper security. To ensure proper
  loading and shipment, take the following actions:
     2.9.6.1. Train load teams to standard;
     2.9.6.2. Secure all equipment stowed inside vehicles so it does not move during rough
     port handling and high seas or rough air turbulence;
     2.9.6.3. Comply with AFIs and guidelines for airlift of hazardous materials;
     2.9.6.4. Ensure vehicles have required tiedown shackles;
     2.9.6.5. Keep personnel out from under equipment being lifted aboard ship;
     2.9.6.6. Coordinate and enforce requirements for vehicle fuel levels;
     2.9.6.7. Coordinate port of embarkation shipping requirements for bulk fuel or
     Petroleum, Oils, and Lubricants (POL) tank transporters; and
     2.9.6.8. Ensure vehicle master switches are turned off immediately after loading.
  2.9.7. Request the following information or consider:
     2.9.7.1. Medical facilities available;
     2.9.7.2. Airfield familiarization training to include: runway, ramp, over-run condition,
     and foreign object damage (FOD) potential;
     2.9.7.3. Hung and hot ordnance and hot cargo areas and procedures;
     2.9.7.4. Combat Aircraft Parking Area (CAPA);
     2.9.7.5. Airfield lighting;
     2.9.7.6. Air traffic control and radar approach control (RAPCON) procedures and
     language limitations;
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                    19


     2.9.7.7. Birdstrike/wildlife hazard potential;
     2.9.7.8. Midair collision potential;
     2.9.7.9. Alternate/Emergency/Divert airfields and procedures;
     2.9.7.10. Helicopter and rescue support;
     2.9.7.11. Tower and supervisor of flight (SOF) capabilities and procedures;
     2.9.7.12. Local obstructions;
     2.9.7.13. Climatic conditions and required flight gear, personal protective equipment and
     work clothing;
     2.9.7.14. Aircraft arresting barriers, cables (tape, configuration, rig time);
     2.9.7.15. Hydrazine response areas and procedures (if applicable);
     2.9.7.16. Ejection and jettison areas;
     2.9.7.17. Sufficiency of aircraft fire fighting and rescue response capabilities; and
     2.9.7.18. Hazardous materials storage and incident response capabilities.
     2.9.7.19. Identified on- and off-base safety threats to personnel;
     2.9.7.20. Housing and working facilities;
     2.9.7.21. Ground transportation plan, schedule, and vehicle support;
     2.9.7.22. Availability of portable radios and frequencies;
     2.9.7.23. Importance of adequate rest;
     2.9.7.24. Key personnel and agency listing;
     2.9.7.25. Message center and command post capabilities to include use of address
     indicator groups (AIGs);
     2.9.7.26. Local operating instructions and directives to include munitions restriction
     listing;
     2.9.7.27. Designated explosive routes;
     2.9.7.28. Emergency response capabilities and LIMFACS;
  2.9.8. Disseminate mishap prevention material to units prior to deployment. This material
  should include ―Lessons Learned‖ from mishap reports and other deployments.
  2.9.9. Prepare a deployment safety kit. Equipment must be readily available at the deployed
  location. Specific MAJCOM and unit requirements should be considered. (See Attachment
  5.)
  2.9.10. Coordinate with deployment navigation planning personnel for deployment and
  redeployment routing and ensure aircrews have:
     2.9.10.1. All necessary flight plans and charts.
     2.9.10.2. Refueling and divert data.
     2.9.10.3. Terminal area arrival procedures.

     2.9.10.4. Destination local area maps.
  2.9.11. Brief the deployment commander on preparations and requirements which have been
  planned or completed.
  2.9.12. When pre-deployment contingency and wartime deployment involve live munitions
  ensure the following procedures are considered. NOTE: Pre-deployment explosives safety
  site planning is not intended to duplicate existing explosives safety plans, however, it is to
  ensure proper planning and coordination between deploying and host or support units to
  safely beddown and employ combat forces: see AFMAN 91-201, para 1.4, Planning for
  Deployments.
     2.9.12.1. Are procedures and information provided by the host unit to include:
         2.9.12.1.1. A current and future base explosives location map?
         2.9.12.1.2. A copy of all applicable joint-use and sole-use facilities with Net
         Explosives Weight (NEW) limits and other special provisions?
         2.9.12.1.3. Climatic conditions?
         2.9.12.1.4. Local regulations that may affect the deployed unit’s operations?
         2.9.12.1.5. Aerial photos, if available?
     2.9.12.2. Have OPLAN requirements been reviewed?
     2.9.12.3. Did weapons, flight, and ground safety personnel participate in pre-deployment
     site surveys?
     2.9.12.4. Was coordination with host or support unit accomplished to ensure facilities
     and locations are designated for storage, buildup, and munitions loading operations?
     2.9.12.5. Do plans address pertinent explosives safety information of all explosives
     operations and locations required for the contingency tasking?
     2.9.12.6. If available, were any ―Lessons Learned‖ reviewed and a copy taken to the
     deployed location? NOTE: Two web sites post this type of information. The Defense
     Environmental Network and Information Exchange service maintains an Exercise and
     Deployment          Accident        Prevention       (EDAP)         web       site      at
     https://www.denix.osd.mil/denix/DOD/dod.html with ―lessons learned‖ information. A
     need to know with registration and login is required to gain access. The web site for AEF

                    ARRIVAL AND BARE BASE SITE PREPARATION

3.1. Introduction. For a bare base to withstand a harsh environment and to keep occupants
reasonably comfortable, the location of a facility or utility should be determined by analyzing the
constraints and features of the area. Overall analysis should include the climatic constraints of
solar radiation, temperature, precipitation, and prevailing wind. It should also include natural
features of the ground surfaces, such as topography, ground cover, and drainage patterns.
Follow-on construction, especially during the early stages of bare base erection, should be
initiated so that the primary concerns are preparation of the airfield for its operational mission,
establishment of water treatment plants, and beddown and protection of the inhabitants from the
elements. As the bare base develops and its operational mission is assured, more emphasis can
then be placed on creature comfort items and base support functions such as administrative
offices, personnel, and dining facilities. (See AFPAM 10-219, Volume 5, Bare Base Conceptual
Planning Guide, for additional information.)
3.2. Planning Guidelines. Civil Engineering (CE) will establish the planning criteria for the
various phases involved for construction of major bare base facility and utility requirements.
Remember, the operational mission is the top priority.
   3.2.1. The site should be relatively flat terrain with minimal grading, brush or tree removal
   required. Consider the area for water drainage. If close to a lake or river, stay above the high
   water marks. Never place a tent in a canyon or dry creek bed because these areas may be
   subject to flash floods. Additionally,
       3.2.1.1. Choose a site where blasting or large rock removal is not required.
       3.2.1.2. Choose a site where major soil stabilization work is not required.
       3.2.1.3. Repair of existing roads or construction of new may be required.
       3.2.1.4. Repair of existing runways or construction of new may be required.
       3.2.1.5. Plans for securing the base against intrusion may be required.
       3.2.1.6. The identification of possible minefields should be considered.
3.3. Siting. Proper siting is critical during the planning phase of a contingency operation and
safety issues must be considered. Factoring safety issues up front can alleviate many serious
safety problems later in the deployment. Site selection is the most important step in building a
Tent City or erecting a tent for a specific purpose. Consideration should also be given to future
expansion of the site. Often times small changes in the base layout that are incorporated in the
planning phase can make future expansion much easier and efficient. A poorly chosen site can
have a direct negative impact on the mission. Safety, bioenvironmental engineering, public
health, and civil engineering personnel should all actively participate in the site selection.
   3.3.1. Whenever health, safety, or environmental factors exist, every effort will be made to
   ensure base layout distances comply with established guidance.
3.4. Arrival at Bare Base Locations. As deploying personnel arrive at the bare base location,
CE will immediately begin to erect the base to meet mission requirements. This involves the
 22                                                           AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


erection and construction and the operations and maintenance portions of maintaining the base.
During the erection and construction portion of beddown operations, troops will hit the ground
running. There is much to do and a short time to do it. Water points must be established, critical
facilities must be erected and mission essential generators must be connected to them. Depending
on their condition, airfield pavements may need to be repaired. Navigational aids, runway
lighting, and aircraft arresting systems may have to be repaired, replaced, or installed so that
aircraft can be received and launched. Additionally, site preparation must take place, electrical
generation plants must be installed, and water and electrical distribution systems must be
positioned as tents and shelters are being erected.
   3.4.1. Initial Arrival Conditions. Expect poor conditions upon arrival at the deployed
   location. It may be, depending on the location, extremely harsh with the poorest of living
   conditions. Tents might not yet be constructed. The areas selected to construct tent cities and
   area roadways might need to be cleared of land mines. Sanitation facilities could be non-
   existent. Available latrines might be field constructed from lumber and burn barrels. Shower
   facilities and sinks with running water may not be available. Again, be prepared for the
   worst. There may also be no safety office established or other safety personnel present at a
   bare base location. However, each day conditions will improve.
   3.4.2. Initial activities. Activities will be going on everywhere. Tent after tent will go up,
   planes will take-off and land constantly, and cargo will be marshaled fast and furiously.
   Heavy equipment operators may be challenged to keep the airfield clear of snow or repair
   severely deteriorated roads, along with a multitude of other things. Keep calm and do the job,
   identify problems but be prepared to offer solutions too. Seek the advice of others when
   needed, get out meet people and be seen. Displaying a willingness to help others where
   needed will gain the respect and acceptance of others. As time and the mission permits, help
   with details, put up tents, break down aircraft pallets, etc. Such initial actions may do much
   more for the safety program than would to cite how the operation is not in strict compliance
   with safety or AFI requirements. Remember, priorities will be setting up or maintaining an
   operational airfield and building up the base infrastructure.
       3.4.2.1. It’s a tough act to inform leadership of problems observed and point out how
       personnel could get hurt or how equipment could be damaged, but again, be prepared to
       offer possible solutions. Ask leadership how they want to handle serious safety violations
       that are identified. Be prepared to explain safety’s role in the deployment—an advisor to
       leadership offering risk management solutions while trying to minimize loss of resources.
       Be willing to concede that while they should not become operational norms, certain
       hazards or risks under certain conditions may be necessary to accept. There is a lot to
       contend with and to further complicate matters; operating in a multinational or joint
       environment reporting to a sister service’s commander is a possibility. Be flexible!
   3.4.3. Initial duties upon arrival. It is important to ask questions and get involved with the
   operation upon arrival. If present, contact the superintendent of operations, the person in
   charge of Tent City (often referred to as the Mayor or Sheriff), local safety staff, fire
   department and command post and medical personnel, First Sergeant, and security forces.
   These agencies may offer assistance and identify other areas of concern not yet considered.
   This also informs them upon the arrival of the safety function, which can expedite
   coordination of their support if required. Establish phone, radio, and beeper equipment and
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                        23


  include numbers or call signs as required. The following issues might warrant immediate
  consideration:
     3.4.3.1. Adequacy of aircraft parking plan. Maintenance personnel may need assistance
     generating a parking plan (refer to paragraph 8.2). A review of the plan should include
     evaluating:
         3.4.3.1.1. Driving plan (arrows for driving direction);
         3.4.3.1.2. Letter and number rows;
         3.4.3.1.3. Taxi lines;
         3.4.3.1.4. Annotating restricted area entry control points;
         3.4.3.1.5. Posting NOTAMs if needed;
         3.4.3.1.6. Spots designated for explosives loaded aircraft and combat aircraft
         parking; and
         3.4.3.1.7. Distances between aircraft. Refer to Applicable MDS T.O.’s and AFI’s.
         NOTE: Distances less than those required should be clearly identified on the parking
         plan and briefed to all personnel.
     3.4.3.2. Coordination of the plan with LG, DO, SF and other interested agencies must be
     accomplished before reproduction. After reproduction is accomplished outline restricted
     areas and explosive clear zones in red. Distribution should include: flightline vehicles,
     Maintenance, Operations, Security Forces, and the Fire Department.
  3.4.4. Depending on the nature of one’s duties at the deployed location, it may be necessary
  to contact a number of different agencies or to accomplish a number of tasks while
  establishing the safety function. The following list is not all inclusive, but it is provided as a
  broad overview for consideration.
     3.4.4.1. Safety. If safety support is already present at the deployed location, information
     on the following topics may already be established.
         3.4.4.1.1. Local hazards and restrictions;
         3.4.4.1.2. Emergency phone numbers (let them know how to contact you);
         3.4.4.1.3. Fuel spill procedures;
         3.4.4.1.4. Location, coordinates, frequencies and capabilities of closest hospital(s);
         and
         3.4.4.1.5. Local collision avoidance procedures;
     3.4.4.2. Base Operations (Airport Manager if at civilian airport). This agency may have
     information concerning the following issues.

        terminology for airspace/emergency handling;
        3.4.4.3.3. HATR (Hazardous Air Traffic Report) Procedures; and
        3.4.4.3.4. Review of airfield approaches.
        3.4.4.3.5. Ensuring explosive site plans are in place and complied with.
     3.4.4.4. Fire Department. This agency may have information concerning the following
     issues.
        3.4.4.4.1. Local procedures for requesting emergency response;
        3.4.4.4.2. Set up egress systems training (if necessary);

        Hazard Report, AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR), and
        Mishap Worksheets (if applicable). Establish a bulletin board for extended
        deployments.
        3.4.4.7.2. Identify in writing, those individuals that will perform interim board
        member duties should a Class A or B mishap occur during the deployment. If more
        than one weapon system is deployed, members should be identified for each system
        present.
        3.4.4.7.3. It is extremely important for the flight safety officer to analyze aspects of
        the flying mission and review mission profiles in order to avoid unnecessary risks.
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                      25


           Look at routes, deconfliction plans, altitudes, bump plans, communication plans, etc.
           Failure to advise the planners/mission commander of potential problems could result
           in unnecessary risk and possible injury to personnel or damage to equipment.
           3.4.4.7.4. Begin and keep a log of all discrepancies and corrective actions taken. Pass
           time sensitive information back to home stations immediately if such information can
           be used immediately to prevent problems for elements deploying soon, but not yet
           departed. Additionally, record and transfer all pertinent information to your home
           safety office when you return. As time permits begin a continuity program for
           replacement personnel. This will aid in the smooth transition from one safety person
           to the next. For continuity purposes, as a minimum record and track the information
           listed in Attachment 6.
           3.4.4.7.5. Keep the mission commander informed of all safety discrepancies, injuries
           and reportable mishaps.
           3.4.4.7.6. Ensure medical and police personnel contact safety functions with
           information regarding injuries and traffic accidents.
           3.4.4.7.7. Ensure armory personnel have installed adequate clearing barrels at the
           armory, life support, dining facilities, etc.
           3.4.4.7.8. Contact MWR personnel and work with them to ensure swimming areas,
           gyms, etc., are set up and operated in a safe manner.
           3.4.4.7.9. Contact the deployed First Sergeant and become involved in the planning
           of off-duty activities, i.e.; sports, tours, etc.
           3.4.4.7.10. Locate availability of medical support facilities and ensure mishap
           notification procedures are established and effective.
3.5. Hazards of Interacting With Indigenous Personnel. Rather than throwing surplus
combat rations away; traditionally US troops will often give these rations to needy civilians. One
report indicates that a child sustained injuries from an exploding bottle. The child had taken a
self-heating device (allied heat-tab) from a package of combat rations and placed the heating
device in a bottle with water. Steam formed and the bottle exploded injuring the child. Deployed
personnel must recognize that certain items can be dangerous in the hands of children or other
people who don’t understand written package directions or who don’t know proper uses for the
item in question. Remind deployed personnel that:
   3.5.1. Self-heating devices (MRE heaters) can be dangerous when used improperly;
   3.5.2. Fuel tablets, and silicone crystals used for removing moisture, may be mistaken for
   food;
   3.5.3. Water purifying tablets may be mistaken for medicine;
   3.5.4. People may not be able to read or understand instructions written in English; and
   3.5.5. The same extra caution used to keep potentially dangerous items away from children
   or other at risk people at home should be practiced while deployed. Don’t give away combat
   rations.

          BARE BASE AND TENT CITY CONSTRUCTION AND GUIDELINES

4.1. Bare Base Assets. As deploying personnel arrive at the bare base location, they will be
employed in a logical sequence and tasked to ensure the base is erected in such a way that it can
meet its mission requirements during each stage of development. Employment at a bare base
involves a two-part operation—erection and construction and operations and maintenance.
   4.1.1. Erection and Construction. During the erection and construction portion of beddown
   operations, troops will hit the ground running and there will be a huge amount of activity all
   around. The landscape will literally be changing overnight. There is a lot to do. Water points
   must be established, critical facilities must be erected and mission essential generators must
   be connected to them. Depending on their condition, airfield pavements, navigational aids,
   runway lighting, and aircraft arresting systems may have to be repaired, replaced, or installed
   so that aircraft can be received and launched for operations.
   4.1.2. Operations and Maintenance. The operations and maintenance portion of bare base
   employment is where personnel function much as they do at home stations, performing tasks
   required to keep the base operating day-to-day. However, the distinction between the erection
   and construction portion ending and the operations and maintenance portion starting is
   almost impossible to see. Often there is considerable overlap. For example, once stand-by
   generators have been connected to their facilities, they start receiving operational and
   maintenance checks, even though the electrical distribution system is still being installed in
   other areas of the base.
4.2. Deployment Packages. Primary bare base deployment packages consist of a housekeeping
set; an industrial operations set, and an initial flightline support set, as well as follow-on
flightline packages. One housekeeping set, one industrial operations set, and one initial flightline
set support combined, are designed to support 1,100 people and one aircraft squadron. Each
additional aircraft squadron deployed to that location requires one follow-on flightline operations
package. Civil engineering and medical personnel will layout a basing plan that ensures mission
accomplishment and health hazards are minimized. Address questions that arise during base
build-up to these representatives.
   4.2.1. Housekeeping Set. The housekeeping set is normally the first asset package to arrive.
   This set is assembled to take care of people needs. Construction of the cantonment area
   provides housing, feeding, and hygiene facilities for the troops. The housekeeping set
   facilities are mostly Tent Extendible Modular Personnel (TEMPER) tents. These tents are
   predominately used for troop billeting, and to house shower/shave units, field deployable
   latrines and field laundries. A kitchen is also made up of TEMPER tent construction. The
   housekeeping set provides a few additional TEMPER tents to be used as administrative
   facilities. The housekeeping set contains a limited number of hard walled shelters. Placement
   of these facilities to maintain sanitary and living areas separate from waste and runoff areas
   is important.
   4.2.2. Industrial Operations Set. The second echelon of the typical deployment package is
   the industrial operations set. This set basically provides those base support facilities that
   enable the base to take care of itself. During this stage of development, additional TEMPER
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                           27


   tents, hardwall shelters and other structures arrive to provide facilities for functions such as
   civil engineer shops, supply warehousing, vehicle maintenance shops, chapels, and field
   exchanges. Even though most facilities in this set are TEMPER tents, additional general
   purpose shelters, expandable shelter containers, and tension fabric structures start to arrive.
   TEMPER tents are provided for administration, multi-purpose facilities. The frame supported
   tension fabric structure is a modular structure of between 4,000 and 8,000 square feet that is
   used for supply, vehicle maintenance, and packing and crating type facilities.
   4.2.3. Initial Flightline Support Set. The next stage of bare base development involves the
   installation of the initial flightline support set. This set provides maintenance and operational
   support facilities with associated utilities for one aircraft squadron. The set contains mostly
   hard-walled shelters. Numerous expandable shelter containers provide many of the aircraft
   maintenance shops. General purpose shelters are used for AGE shops and multi-purpose
   functions such as squadron operations and briefing rooms. Functions requiring large work
   areas, like a propulsion shop, are housed in tension fabric structure shelters. There are a
   limited number of TEMPER tents included in this set, which support aircrew alert, fire
   operations, and crash rescue functions. To directly support flying operations, the initial
   flightline support set also contains airfield lighting and aircraft arresting systems.
4.3. Bare Base Construction. Civil Engineering personnel and Preventative Aerospace
Medicine Personnel (PAM) will site and locate all facility groups and they will locate and erect
all utility plants and systems. CE typically erects their own facilities and will furnish a minimum
cadre of personnel to provide technical assistance to other base functions erecting their own
facilities. Medical personnel often erect their facilities too. Careful consideration should be given
to the siting and placement of functional areas and facilities.
4.4. Electrical Services. Bare base electrical packages consist of both high and low voltage
systems. Electrical services should provide electricity for the operation of critical airfield lighting
and communications systems first. Personnel operations and support services will follow. During
the initial period, standard military mobile generators will supply most critical electric power.
Where local electric power generation and distribution facilities are available, they may be used
as a primary source of power; however, provisions must be made to provide back-up power for
critical mission systems. All critical systems must be provided with back-up systems such that
the loss of a single source of power will not endanger the operation of the facility.
   4.4.1. Trained technicians must accomplish the design, operation, and maintenance of
   electrical systems. Only trained personnel should work with energized systems, and then only
   when required by applicable technical data or directives.
   4.4.2. Proper grounding of an electrical system is essential to the safe operation of the
   system and will be accomplished by a qualified electrical technician. Grounding is
   accomplished by driving ground rods into the ground and providing a minimum 10 American
   Wire Gauge (AWG) bare copper wire from the ground rod to the device or system to be
   grounded. The spacing and depth of ground rods depends upon the resistance to ground to the
   earth at the site. In the absence of the capability to measure the resistance to ground and
   determine actual grounding requirements for the site, use a three-fourths inch diameter pipe
   or equivalent solid rod driven 10 feet deep or into the permanent ground water level, if
   known. Electrical continuity is essential in a grounding system; therefore, all connections
   should be clean and permanently bonded.
 28                                                            AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


   4.4.3. The design and application of grounding to an electrical system should be inherent in
   the system installation and not something that can be added at a later date. As previously
   discussed, electrical system trained technicians must accomplish design and installation.
   There are, however, two types of grounding systems not generally associated with the
   electrical systems, which are necessary for the safe operation of an air base. These systems
   are lightning and static electricity protection.
       4.4.3.1. Although not a primary consideration for initial construction, lightning
       protection should be considered for protection of essential facilities and buildings.
       (Contact the Weapons Safety Manager and reference AFMAN 91-201 for explosive
       operating and storage facility lightning protection systems.) Essential or high-risk
       facilities or buildings include fuel storage areas and ammunition or explosive materials
       storage or handling. Protection for these facilities can be accomplished by providing
       grounded air terminals along high points and the perimeter of buildings or a series of high
       towers located beyond a given area to be protected. The essential feature of a lightning
       protection system is that air terminals, conductors, and ground rods be large enough to
       provide a path of least resistance to ground for a given area.
       4.4.3.2. Static electricity protection is a primary consideration whenever there is a
       potential of static electricity build-up and a discharge or sparking could injure personnel
       or cause ignition of explosive materials. Static grounding is essential for portable,
       normally ungrounded motor-driven equipment. Primary considerations include
       Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) facilities, weapons systems, communications
       facilities, and airplane parking and maintenance facilities.
4.5. Airfield Lighting. If installation of an airfield lighting system is required, there are
portable airfield light sets that can be installed by contingency forces. Airfield lighting kits can
provide threshold and runway edge lighting for a bare base runway. Portable airfield lighting is
highly reliable and identical to airfield lighting systems used at military and civilian airports
throughout most of the world. In the event of a deployment to a bare base where the airfield
lighting is inoperative, portable kits can be used to repair the existing systems or, if damaged
beyond repair, to set up a completely independent system. Where operation of the airfield at
night is necessary, or a possibility, provisions for alternate lighting systems must be provided for
in advance. Alternate lighting systems consist of prepositioned materials and equipment for
emergency use. This alternate lighting can be used in the absence or failure of electrically
powered systems. Advance planning and provisions for alternate systems such as fires, use of
vehicle lighting, and driving generators from other motor sources are all a part of the initially
deployed mission forces and fall under the category of expedient construction.
4.6. Water Distribution. It is absolutely essential that a water source, which can be made
potable, is available for bare base operations. There are many sources, uses, treatment, and
distribution considerations for water. Civil engineers ensure bottled or treated water is available.
Bioenvironmental engineering or PAM team approves water for consumption and potability for
deployed personnel.
   4.6.1. Sources. In non-arid environments water is generally readily available in streams,
   rivers, and lakes. This water usually requires only clarification and disinfection to make it
   potable. Groundwater (well-water) may also be abundant. Many times the only treatment
   groundwater requires is disinfection. However, groundwater near industrial areas should be
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                         29


   tested for the presence of hazardous wastes. All water must also be examined for the
   presence of human waste. The single most important characteristic of arid areas is the lack of
   water. Surface water is limited to a very few rivers and intermittent streams that benefit from
   sparse rainfall. Except for limited areas, primarily along the coast, groundwater is also scarce
   and is generally unfit to drink because of the dissolved solids content. Because of widespread
   unsanitary practices, all water in underdeveloped countries, no matter what the source (this
   includes ice obtained from local vendors) should be considered contaminated with disease
   causing organisms, until proven otherwise. A contingency force must be prepared to produce
   its own potable water from any available source, and must constantly strive to conserve this
   mission essential resource, regardless of the water’s quality and ultimate use. Seawater
   obtained offshore at a location removed from a sewage outfall is normally relatively clean. It
   is very salty and contains suspended particles of sand and bacteria. Seawater may be used
   without adverse effects for electrical grounding, housekeeping tasks, firefighting (not in fire
   vehicles), some construction tasks, showering, and laundering. It should not be used where
   continued use could corrode critical metal surfaces. When used for showers, laundries, and
   personal hygiene purposes, it must be disinfected.
   4.6.2. Treatment. The primary water treatment equipment item used in bare base operations
   is the Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU), which can produce potable water
   from nearly any source of water. The ROWPU purifies water by first removing large
   suspended material from the water in a multimedia filter. The remaining suspended material
   is removed in a cartridge filter. The water is then pumped at high pressure (up to 950 psi) to
   reverse osmosis membranes. The membranes allow about 1/3 of the water to pass through
   them. Since very little of the dissolved solids in the water can pass through the membranes,
   the water that has passed through is desalinated. The dissolved solids concentrated in the
   water that does not pass through the membranes produce a brine water discharge. The brine
   water discharge flow is typically twice the product water flow. Over the course of a day at a
   large water treatment plant many gallons of brine water will be produced. Sometimes this by-
   product can be put to good use in construction or dust control or stored for fire fighting.
   Usually, however, more brine will be produced than can be used effectively; therefore, some
   additional, alternate methods of disposing this waste material must be developed.
4.7. Petroleum, Oil and Lubricants (POL) Sites. The preservation of fuel quality,
minimization of losses, air pollution control, and safety of operation are important considerations
in the design and construction of fuel storage facilities. Storage tanks are required to provide an
operating and reserve supply of fuel at almost all Air Force bases. At certain air bases, because
of the proximity of the enemy lines, the predicted enemy threat, or the mission duration of the
airfield, it may not be practical to store POL products at forward or battle area airfields. Aviation
and ground POL products are normally stored in 55-gallon drums, collapsible bladders, or steel-
welded or bolted tanks.
   4.7.1. Steel 55-gallon drums are used for fuels and lubricants. For storage, drums are
   segregated by type and grade of fuel and stacked horizontally (on sides) in rows. Drums
   should be placed end-to-end in double rows with closures (bungs and vents) facing outward.
   4.7.2. Synthetic-rubber-impregnated fabric containers may be used for storage of liquid
   fuels. Containers should be installed on level ground, free of rocks or other sharp objects, and
   surrounded by dikes or ditches capable of holding 125 percent of the container capacity.
 30                                                            AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


   4.7.3. Storage site preparation may consist of grading, berming, and installing a 3-inch dike
   drain pipe with gate valve. All fuel bladders, regardless of size and content, will be bermed;
   all fuel bladder dikes will be fitted with a protective liner to prevent environmental damage
   and contamination. Other considerations include the following:
       4.7.3.1. Is the site located on level ground but contoured in such a way that the flow is
       directed away from congested areas in the event of a leak?
       4.7.3.2. Are low-lying or depressed areas avoided for storage since hazardous vapors are
       likely to remain present in some cases?
       4.7.3.3. Are bulk tanks located 50 feet from open flames or other spark-producing
       devices?
       4.7.3.4. Are fuel storage areas equipped with dikes that are sufficient to retain all liquid
       contents of drums stored?
       4.7.3.5. Are fire warning signs posted on all four sides of fuel storage areas?
       4.7.3.6. Are drip pans available for dispensing stations?
       4.7.3.7. Are caps on fuel cans or Jerry-cans screwed tight to prevent leaks?
       4.7.3.8. Are leaking fuel cans removed from service?
       4.7.3.9. Are spills cleaned up immediately?
       4.7.3.10. Are open tanks or drums grounded?
       4.7.3.11. Is the area maintained in a neat and orderly manner to facilitate efficient
       operations and inspections?
       4.7.3.12. Are fire extinguishers properly located in unobstructed areas? Are they checked
       periodically for serviceability?
       4.7.3.13. Is the fuel storage area located and sited in an area IAW explosive safety
       standards?
4.8. Munitions Storage Areas. Area preparation may consist of siting, grading, constructing
berms, and sandbagging. Construction of storage bunkers will likely begin as soon as possible
after other essential tasks are completed. In the interim period, munitions should be stored in
properly segregated and if possible properly barricaded locations IAW AFM 91-201. Also,
actions for providing a grounding system for the munitions area consisting of ground rods and
connecting grid system should be accomplished. See Chapter 9 for additional information.
4.9. Medical Units. Medical units should be sited in lower threat areas of the base, but near
combat support group services facilities (billeting, showers, laundry).
4.10. Storage and Supply Areas. Sites should be easily accessible to vehicles and Material
Handling Equipment to facilitate the marshalling of supplies. See Chapter 7 for additional
information.
4.11. Showers and Latrines. Areas should be central to the billeting tents but at least 100 feet
away for sanitary reasons. Other considerations include:
   4.11.1. Are water heaters located on metal or insulated floors--not directly on wooden
   floors?
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                        31


   4.11.2. Does the sewer drainage system drain freely and away from living areas to prevent
   back-ups and subsequent health hazards?
   4.11.3. Is heater temperature set low enough to prevent scalding?
   4.11.4. Are heating units and electrical wiring located well away from shower areas?
   4.11.5. Are fire alarm systems located in or near shower and latrine tents?
   4.11.6. Are there fire extinguishers located in or near the shower and latrine tents?
   4.11.7. If shower tents are elevated (on back of semi-trailers) are handrails installed with the
   stairway?
   4.11.8. Are shower and latrine facilities located down slope of potable water sources if
   possible?
4.12. Laundry Sites. Locate central to billeting tents but far enough away so generator noise
can be shielded from sleeping tents.
4.13. Kitchen and Dining Facilities. Areas should be centrally located in a dry area, which
will not pose an increased health threat, i.e. well away from trash collection areas. Other
considerations include:
   4.13.1. Are burner-refueling areas located 50 feet from tents and facilities and lighting and
   generator equipment?
   4.13.2. Is the accumulation of grease on tent surfaces monitored and periodic cleaning
   accomplished?
   4.13.3. Are disposal areas for grease at least 8 feet from the tent?
   4.13.4. Are a minimum of two fire extinguishers provided for cooking areas? (Extinguishers
   should be located and unobstructed at the entrances to the cooking areas.)
   4.13.5. Is the electrical distribution panel located at least 6 feet from the kitchen tent?
   4.13.6. Are electrical generators positioned at least 15 feet from tent walls? (Fuel tanks
   should be positioned as remotely as possible from generators and diked with fuel lines
   protected.)
   4.13.7. Are portable hot water heaters set at least 20 feet from the dispensing area?
   4.13.8. Are adequate unobstructed aisles and exits maintained?
   4.13.9. Are gasoline ovens located away from tent walls (3 foot minimum)?
   4.13.10. Are fans or other means available to exhaust carbon monoxide fumes generated by
   stoves?
   4.13.11. Are ovens, immersion heaters, and stoves insulated from wooden floors?
       4.13.11.1. Are the stovepipes to these units insulated from the tent and wooden floors?
   4.13.12. Are water heaters located on metal or insulated floors and not directly on wooden
   floors?
   4.13.13. Are wooden grease traps located away from ignition sources?
 32                                                            AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


   4.13.14. Are lighting fixtures guarded (globe over bulb or florescent tube shielded) over
   food servicing line to protect food from broken glass?
   4.13.15. Are floors kept clean and grease free?
   4.13.16. Are paper and waste products properly disposed?
   4.13.17. Are cutlery and other sharp kitchen implements guarded?
   4.13.18. Are storage areas kept clean and neat?
   4.13.19. Are heavy items (cans, jars, pots, etc.) stored on lower level shelves?
   4.13.20. Do dining hall personnel wear steel toe shoes?
NOTE: Refer to public health personnel for guidance in sanitation.
4.14. Common Facilities. Most deployment packages consist of the Tent Extendible Modular
Personnel (TEMPER) tent, small and medium shelter systems, Expandable Shelter Container
(ESC) and General Purpose (GP) shelter. These are used to provide personnel living quarters and
work centers. Those workers that do not have a basic knowledge of bare base assets and their
function should seek assistance from civil engineers or other certified personnel before
attempting to erect facilities without the proper training or guidance. Civil engineers may need to
erect all GP shelters--these are probably too complex for most base organizations to handle and
training is not readily available. Having a small cadre of personnel, knowledgeable on TEMPER
tent and ESC erection techniques, available to assist the base populace is advisable. There will be
occasions where untrained people will be faced with facility erection tasks and without
supervisory and instructional guidance these individuals may injure themselves or others and
damage assets. At no time should the general base populace attempt utility connections, as basic
as they may be, to facilities. The potential for damage to system components and harm to both
base personnel and electrical crews is too great. Of the assets discussed here, TEMPER tents are
by far the most numerous, followed by the ESC and then the GP Shelter.
   4.14.1. TEMPER Tents and Small Shelter System (SSS): The TEMPER tent and the SSS are
   soft-walled shelters consisting mainly of a synthetic material fabric supported by an
   aluminum frame structure. Their modular construction allows many different configurations.
   They are designed for use in desert, tropical, and temperate climates and come in both desert
   tan and forest green colors. Utility support includes electrical service for lighting and
   convenience outlets and provisions for heating and cooling using the bare base environmental
   control unit or the field deployable environmental control unit.
       4.14.1.1. The TEMPER tent is easy to erect and all base personnel should be able to
       erect this shelter or at least be prepared to provide assistance given proper instruction and
       guidance. Proper safety procedures during the erection of all facilities will be strictly
       enforced. Work gloves are recommended to protect workers hands while they are
       engaged in TEMPER tent construction. NOTE: Driving stakes in hardened ground may
       require the use of sledgehammers or air-powered hand tools. Additional PPE, to protect
       the workers’ eyes and hearing may be required in these situations.
       4.14.1.2. TEMPER tents should not be placed in a location subject to jet blast or high
       winds.
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                       33


       4.14.1.3. When erecting the tent personnel should be careful to avoid pinching hands or
       fingers. Workers need to avoid the hinges at ridge or eave locations when holding or
       lifting the tent frame.
       4.14.1.4. Lifting the tent requires several people lifting in unison; team lifting should be
       stressed so that one person gives the signal for all team members to raise the tent. Proper
       lifting techniques, squatting and using the legs and not the back, will be used in order to
       avoid back injury. It is essential that a tent side be raised or lowered smoothly and
       evenly; failure to do so can damage the tent’s frame. NOTE: Under windy conditions
       extra personnel may be needed to erect and hold the tent until the frame can be firmly
       staked.
   4.14.2. General Purpose Tents. General purpose tents may still be used on some
   deployments and are described as either GP medium or GP large tents. The GP tent is a soft-
   walled shelter of canvas or synthetic fabrics supported by poles. Often GP tents will be
   erected over a frame structure constructed of lumber (Hardback). Utility support for these
   tents includes electrical service for lighting and can include convenience outlets and
   provisions for heating through the use of fueled heater units.
4.15. Other Factors for Facilities. Several factors should be considered during all phases of
Tent City construction. These include:
   4.15.1. Will streets and tents be marked with signs? (Assists in identifying emergency
   location for responding medical, fire, security, and safety personnel.)
   4.15.2. Is the Tent City sited outside of munitions clear zones and runway approach and
   departure zones? Is it logistically laid out to avoid maze-type effects?
   4.15.3. Was the site coordinated with the respective weapons safety and airfield management
   personnel?
   4.15.4. If waivers are required, are they approved prior to continuation of planning at the
   site?
   4.15.5. Do operations facilities (maintenance support tents, operations tents, etc.) planned for
   the flight line area meet the airfield clearance criteria from taxiways, runways, aircraft
   parking ramps, engine-runup pads, etc.?
   4.15.6. Is a section of the Tent City designated for aircrew only? This area should be a 24-
   hour crew rest area to allow for around the clock air operations.
   4.15.7. Does the Tent City layout provide for fire lanes throughout the site that:
       4.15.7.1. Are adequate for emergency response vehicles to get through?
       4.15.7.2. Provide access from two unobstructed directions?
   4.15.8. Are fenced-in areas planned with emergency gates to permit ready access by fire-
   fighting equipment and also to provide for safe evacuation in case of emergency?
   4.15.9. Is there a plan for fire fighting outside tents?
   4.15.10. Are exterior area lighting requirements specified and are they adequate for security
   and safety during night operations? If not, have suitable exterior light fixtures and electric
   boxes been ordered?

   4.15.11. Are vehicle parking areas planned?
   4.15.12. Is the fuel truck parking area separated from other vehicle parking and 50 feet from
   spark-producing devices?
   4.15.13. Has a diked fuel storage area (MOGAS, diesel, and kerosene, if required, for
   heaters and cook stoves) been planned?
   4.15.14. Are ―Hazardous Areas‖, ―No Smoking‖, and Fire Symbol signs available?
      4.15.15. Is the fuel storage area sited 50 feet from flame or spark producing devices?
   4.15.16. Have fire alarms (bells, metal rods, or triangles) been placed throughout the area?
   Are plans for fire protection and emergency evacuation established?
   4.15.17. Has a communication system been established? This system should address recall
   or emergency notification of personnel. In the event of an emergency are personnel informed
   so that they know where to assemble to ensure accountability?
4.16. Tent Heaters: Improper fueling of tent heaters often results in fires. Deployed personnel
must know necessary precautions to avoid starting a tent fire when refueling heating devices. On
one deployment contractor personnel attempted to refuel a hot kerosene heater with MOGAS
inside a laundry tent, the tent caught fire and was completely destroyed. Personnel that will
operate tent heaters must be trained on their use—including civilian and contracted personnel.
Mark fuel cans by type of fuel and store different types of fuel in separate locations. In some
situations it may be necessary to refuel heaters outside of tents and not refuel heaters when they
are hot.
   4.16.1. Preway 70,000 BTU Tent Heater. The Preway radiant type heater operates on diesel
   fuel or JP-8. Type of fuel for use will be confirmed prior to operation of the heater. Use of
   improper fuel can result in detonation of the heater. Fuel is stored and fed from a standard 5-
   gallon Jerry can hung on the side of the heater frame. Designed for floor installation, the
   heater must be installed and rest on non-combustible material. Stovepipe sections run from
   the heater through the roof of the tent. Keep combustible materials at least 18 inches from the
   stovepipe unless the pipe is shielded by metal or other approved material. It is important to
   ensure the heater is completely level to permit fuel flow to the heater.
   4.16.2. If heaters are used, personnel should be aware of the following:
         4.16.2.1. Tents MUST be occupied when heaters are on.
         4.16.2.2. The last person leaving the tent must turn the heater off. However, the ranking
         person is ultimately responsible.
         4.16.2.3. Unless trained, occupants WILL NOT attempt to repair the heater.
         4.16.2.4. Trash or other materials will not be thrown into and burned in the heater.
         4.16.2.5. The heater should not be operated on the highest setting.
         4.16.2.6. The heater will not be used for drying personal effects and combustible items
         will not be placed on the heater.
         4.16.2.7. All combustible objects are to be kept at least 36 inches (3 feet) from the
         heater.
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                        35


   4.16.3. The following actions should be taken to ensure stovepipe safety:
       4.16.3.1. Are stovepipes tightly joined along the vertical seam (this is to mitigate carbon
       monoxide poisoning hazards)?
       4.16.3.2. Are stovepipe sections tightly joined together, and if held together by rivets, are
       the rivets of a material other than aluminum?
       4.16.3.3. Do stovepipes have weather caps that are well seated in the top of the stack?
       4.16.3.4. Does the stack extend above the top of the tent to eliminate the possibility of
       fire?
       4.16.3.5. Are stovepipe stacks firmly anchored with guy lines in the event of strong
       winds?
       4.16.3.6. Are tent liners properly tied off around stove pipe openings so the liner does
       not touch the stove pipe?
       4.16.3.7. If ventilation is questionable, a carbon monoxide detector should be placed in
       each tent.
NOTE: Before installing and operating any heater inside a tent, ensure the proper authority
approves its use. Items, such as the M1941 heater and locally procured kerosene type heaters
can create a severe fire hazard when improperly used and maintained. Do not use the Yukon
Stove (M-1950) in extendible modular tents.
4.17. Office and Billeting Tents:
   4.17.1. Is there a fire extinguisher and serviceable smoke detector in every tent? NOTE:
   Providing carbon monoxide detectors in tents should also be considered.
   4.17.2. Are wooden floors constructed so that they are well supported, level, and free of
   large cracks?
   4.17.3. Are tents well-staked in case of high winds?
   4.17.4. Are tent liners properly installed?
   4.17.5. If installed, do wooden tent doors swing outward so as not to impede emergency
   egress from the tent?
   4.17.6. Electrical installation considerations:
       4.17.6.1. Are electrical line installations to the tent constructed to prevent a tripping
       hazard?
       4.17.6.2. Are electrical line splices properly wrapped and waterproofed to prevent
       shocking hazards or arcing (fire) hazards?
       4.17.6.3. Are waterproof electrical boxes used in exterior areas where required?
       4.17.6.4. Are waterproof exterior fixtures used for exterior lighting?
       4.17.6.5. Are fixtures suitably protected from the elements to prevent shocking or
       arcing?

   4.18.1. Tent Leader:
         4.18.1.1. Do senior ranking members of each occupied tent or module understand they
         will be the tent leaders and will ensure rules are understood and followed?
         4.18.1.2. Does the tent leader ensure each facility has a working smoke detector mounted
         at a high point in the tent and clear from the air ducts or obstruction? (Test smoke
         detectors weekly.)
         4.18.1.3. Does the tent leader ensure each facility has a working fire extinguisher at a
         door or at a center pole? (Tampering with fire extinguishers is prohibited.)
         4.18.1.4. Do tent leaders ensure quiet hours are established and followed (i.e., 2200 to
         0600)? (Respect and courtesy for your neighbor’s desires and rest requirements are
         essential for mission requirements and safety. Shift workers usually reside in the
         community and may require alternate quiet hours.)
         4.18.1.5. Does the tent leader ensure all partitions are fully removable, to ensure the tent
         can be utilized in surge conditions?
         4.18.1.6. Is an unobstructed, 32-inch wide (minimum) center aisle from the front door to
         the back door provided for occupants to reach the exit from any partitioned area.
             4.18.1.6.1. Partitioned areas must have an unobstructed, minimum, 28-inch wide
             opening to egress to the center aisle.
             4.18.1.6.2. Plywood partitions must conform to fire safety requirements and be
             approved and installed by CE.
             4.18.1.6.3. Soft partitions must be constructed so they can be pushed aside for
             emergency egress. (They cannot be rigidly fastened in place.)
         4.18.1.7. Does the tent leader ensure tent electrical systems, including light sets, are not
         used in any way as support for partitions? (Nothing may be suspended from light set
         wiring. In addition, partitions must be constructed so light bulbs are not within 4 inches
         of the partition.)
         4.18.1.8. Does the tent leader ensure supplemental heating devices, such as space heaters
         are not used, unless approved by CE?
         4.18.1.9. Does the tent leader ensure extension cords are rated at 15 amps or higher and
         equipped with a grounded three prong plug?
         4.18.1.10. Does the tent leader ensure light bulb wattages do not exceed recommended
         maximums?
         4.18.1.11. Do tent leaders and occupants understand Medical, Services, Fire, and Safety
         officials reserve the right to enter and inspect any unit for safety, health, sanitation, and
         quality of life concerns as well as for the removal of contraband or restricted items? Do
         they also understand that discrepancies must be corrected within 24 hours?
      4.18.2. All occupants will:
         4.18.2.1. Comply with absolutely no open-flame or hot plate cooking.

      4.18.2.7. Keep garbage cans emptied and free of overflow. (Keep lids on cans. Residents
      are responsible for emptying contents into dumpsters daily in order to reduce health risks
      and pest infestation.)
      4.18.2.8. Keep outdoor BBQ grills at least 15 feet from any structure. Dispose of coals
      and ashes into specially marked and designated trashcans, douse with water, and allow 8
      hours to cool before placing into dumpsters. (Do not dump ashes or coals on the ground,
      burning coals that have been barely covered with sand or soil and left unattended, have
      caused injury to people.)
4.19. Fire Prevention:
   4.19.1. Is a nighttime fire watch program established and coordinated with fire department
   personnel for tent areas?
   4.19.2. Is a daily walk-through of tent areas accomplished by the Fire Marshal and safety
   officials?

  4.20.3. Effective placement of camouflage netting often requires climbing on top of
  buildings or other areas not normally used, even by the people most familiar with the facility.
  Proper sized ladders will be used when placing netting on elevated surfaces.
  4.20.4. Use adequate procedures and safety equipments to protect workers from falls during
  placement of camouflage netting from buildings roofs.
  4.20.5. Tent leaders will ensure camouflage netting is erected outside tents only. It must be
  removed by the user or occupant if it interferes with maintenance or construction work within
  Tent City. It must not:
     4.20.5.1. Obstruct fire lanes, overhangs, or main walkways;
     4.20.5.2. Be tied to any electrical panel or box; or
     4.20.5.3. Be attached at any sheet metal screws, metal flashing, or roof overhang.

                        DEFENSIVE FIGHTING POSITIONS (DFP)

5.1. General. A defensive fighting position is a structure from which troops engage the enemy
with direct and indirect fire weapons. The positions provide necessary protection for personnel,
yet allow for fields of fire and maneuver. A protective position protects personnel and (or)
material not directly involved with fighting the enemy from attack or environmental extremes.
DFPs can be constructed from a number of available materials; steel, lumber, wood, concrete,
etc. Construction often entails some earthwork such as digging a trench or other below ground
excavation. The collapses of poorly constructed DFPs have caused serious injury to personnel
and in some cases materials used, like sand filled bags and lumber, can weigh thousands of
pounds. It is absolutely imperative that engineering personnel design and construct DFPs. Listed
below are several factors that should be considered. Also refer to US Army Field Manual 5-103,
Survivability, for additional information.
   5.1.1. Do supervisors ensure alternate entrance and exit doors to buildings are not physically
   blocked or barricaded by the location of DFPs?
   5.1.2. Are DFPs constructed away from locations that may put the defender’s personal safety
   in jeopardy, (away from fuel tank vents, edges of roofs, high voltage equipment, etc.?)
   5.1.3. Are DFPs, built on top of structures such as aircraft shelters, blastwalls, or towers,
   equipped with appropriate guardrails or barriers to prevent personnel from falling?
   5.1.4. Are wooden boards used in shelters checked for structural integrity and adequate size
   for the bearing load (no rotten wood)?
   5.1.5. Does DFP construction compensate for unlevel ground?
   5.1.6. Do workers ensure the following materials are NOT used?
       5.1.6.1. Plywood less than three-fourths of an inch in thickness;
       5.1.6.2. Warped, bent, or brittle wood or metal;
       5.1.6.3. Materials saturated with chemical residue (fuel, oil, etc.);
       5.1.6.4. Used tires that are wet inside;
       5.1.6.5. Building material with exposed nails and jagged or sharp edges.
   5.1.7. Do DFPs have the following attributes:
       5.1.7.1. Wall material must be overlapped in two directions or otherwise interlock.
       5.1.7.2. Walls must not lean outward or inward.
       5.1.7.3. Wall thickness must be a minimum of two sand bags laid flat side-by-side or the
       length of one sand bag.
       5.1.7.4. Roofs shall not deflect downward greater than 1 inch.
       5.1.7.5. When railroad ties, runway matting, planks, or similar material is used for roof
       construction, walls must be ―L‖-shaped, four sand bags thick, and interlocked at the
       corners.
 40                                                             AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


         5.1.7.6. Roof support stringers must be of adequate design and construction to support
         intended weight.
   5.1.8. Water-repellent material, i.e., plastic sheeting, can be used as long as it does not affect
   the stability of the DFP walls or roof.
   5.1.9. When DFPs are constructed on top of facilities do they meet the following
   requirements:
         5.1.9.1. Civil engineers have determined that the additional weight of DFP will not
         damage the facility.
         5.1.9.2. Access to the DFP is clear of obstructions.
         5.1.9.3. DFPs are no closer than 6 feet from any edge of the roof.
   5.1.10. When DFPs are located 4 feet or more off the ground and no guardrail is installed,
   precautions need to be taken to prevent troops from mistakenly walking off the edge of the
   facility. For example: ensuring the DFP entrance and exit are away from the edge of the
   facility.
   5.1.11. When DFPs are located 4 feet or more off the ground with no permanently fixed
   stairs, portable ladders are acceptable substitutes. Portable ladders for DFPs may be
   commercial or locally built. NOTE: For DFPs less than 4 feet off the ground, steps may be
   constructed. Each step shall not exceed 8 inches in height, will be at least 9 inches deep to
   allow for safe and secure footing with a maximum of four steps.
   5.1.12. Reconstruct DFPs when:
         5.1.12.1. Roofs deflect downward more than 1 inch.
         5.1.12.2. Walls, entrances, or gunport openings lean visibly in or out.
         5.1.12.3. Ladder or step conditions exist which are not in compliance with the guidelines
         in paragraph 5.1.11.
5.2. Commander’s Responsibilities:
   5.2.1. Ensure DFPs are maintained and improved as necessary.
   5.2.2. Provide materials.
   5.2.3. Supervise construction.
   5.2.4. Inspect periodically.
   5.2.5. Plan and select fighting-position sites.
   5.2.6. Get technical advice from engineers as required.
5.3. Safety Tips:
      5.3.1. Dig excavations as deep as possible. Don’t build above-ground unless absolutely
      necessary.
      5.3.2. Don’t use sand or sandbags for overhead structural support.
      5.3.3. Maintain, repair, and improve positions continuously.
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                      41


   5.3.4. Inspect and test position safety daily, after heavy rain, and after receiving direct and
   indirect fire.
   5.3.5. Revet (face with masonry or other material) excavations in sandy soil.
   5.3.6. Don’t drive vehicles within 6 feet of a position.
   5.3.7. Interlock sandbags for double-wall construction and corners.
   5.3.8. Check stability of wall bases. Don’t forget lateral bracing on stringers.
   5.3.9. Don’t put personnel in marginally safe bunkers.
   5.3.10. Don’t overfill sandbags; fill them approximately three-quarters full.
   5.3.11. Built-Up Positions:
       5.3.11.1. Use only when absolutely necessary (e.g., bedrock prevents excavation).
       5.3.11.2. Use appropriate construction and structural material.
   5.3.12. Soil Considerations:
       5.3.12.1. Remind personnel that rain, vibration, and vehicle traffic will weaken the soil.
       Also, open excavations will not hold a side wall; they cave in and collapse.
       5.3.12.2. Maintain position by periodically inspecting revetment walls, cover,
       waterproofing, and slopes. If bunker walls or roofs are bowing, reinforce them or
       abandon them. Inspect stringers for wear, cracks, bends, and bows. Replace if necessary.
       5.3.12.3. After an artillery or missile barrage—test, inspect, and repair position.
5.4. Exercises. Are exercise fire-fights on top of certain areas prohibited as determined by the

                                            Chapter 6

                              RAPID RUNWAY REPAIR (RRR)

6.1. General. Engineering forces require proper equipment and adequate personnel to achieve
expedient repairs to war damaged airfield pavements. To fulfill this requirement, the Air Force
has developed equipment sets for accomplishing airfield pavement repairs. Procedures for crater
repair using several types of fill material as well as use of folded fiberglass mat (FFM) and AM-
2 mat are involved in RRR. Filling craters and repairing a taxiway or runway can be hazardous
work even in peacetime. Some of the potential hazards involved with such operations are listed
in this chapter.
6.2. Basic RRR Set. The basic set was developed by the Air Force to provide an expedient
bomb damage repair capability to theater air bases. The equipment in this set is designed to
support the repair of three 50-foot bomb craters with AM-2 matting within a 4-hour period. The
basic set also supports the folded fiberglass mat (FFM) method using the same criterion. The
basic RRR set (either AM-2 or FFM) is currently in place at most high-threat theater main
operating bases (MOBs) and may or may not be supplemented with additional components.
6.3. Components of the Aluminum Matting (AM-2) RRR Patch Kit:
   6.3.1. AM-2 aluminum matting is hand-assembled and anchored over the crater, which was
   prepared with a layer of crushed stone.
   6.3.2. These kits contain all required tools and materials needed to assemble the patches:
       6.3.2.1. Mats—The large mat is 2 feet by 12 feet by 1 1/2 inches and weighs 144 pounds.
       The small mat (half mat) is 2 feet by 6 feet by 1 1/2 inches and weighs 72 pounds.
       6.3.2.2. Starter Keylock—A narrow strip of matting 4 inches wide with two male edges.
       It comes in three lengths and its function is to allow bi-directional installation of matting.
       6.3.2.3. Locking Bar—The matting is locked together with the locking bar, which is 2
       feet by 3/4 inches by 3/16 inches. It is inserted at the leading edge of the joint. The
       locking bars are also used as temporary spacers for aligning mats by inserting the bar in
       the top of the groove between panels.
       6.3.2.4. Towing Bar Tube—This is a 2-foot long hollow tube with a mat end joint
       connection on one side. The tube is connected to the mat ends and is used for pulling
       matting over a crater.
       6.3.2.5. Starter Towing Bar Tube—This tube is installed on the mat ends at the starter
       keylock. This is 1 inch longer than the normal towing tube. This is to compensate for the
       width of the starter keylock.
       6.3.2.6. Mandrel—A steel rod that is inserted in the towing tubes and secured by the
       towing bar stop and end caps. It also keeps the mat aligned during pulling of the mat.
       6.3.2.7. Tow Clamp—A yoke-shaped device of two parts that is bolted together to
       enclose the towing tube for pulling.
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                      43


       6.3.2.8. Ramp—This is a 6-foot section of tapered matting that attaches to the male side
       of the mat. The ramp provides a smooth transition from runway surface to matting
       surface.
6.4. Folded Fiberglass Mat. The second repair method uses the FFM. This procedure, which is
currently the primary repair method, involves the installation of an anchored FFM over a crater,
which was prepared with a layer of well-compacted crushed stone. Crater preparation is
essentially identical to that used with the AM-2 matting system.
   6.4.1. A standard folded fiberglass mat weighs about 3,000 pounds and consists of nine
   fiberglass panels, each 6 feet wide, 30 feet long and about 3/8-inch thick. Elastomer hinges
   that are approximately 3 inches wide connect the panels. When folded, the mats are 6 feet
   wide, 30 feet long, and 8 to 10 inches thick.
6.5. Hazards Of RRR:
   6.5.1. Lifting AM-2 matting weighing 72 or 144 pounds. Proper lifting techniques must be
   emphasized during training.
   6.5.2. Workers getting fingers or toes pinched or crushed, or suffering lower leg injuries
   during assembly of AM-2 matting.
   6.5.3. Equipment operators, especially augmentees, may not be properly trained or familiar
   with operating special equipment.
6.6. Specific Requirements:
   6.6.1. Equipment operators must be certified on the types of equipment they operate
   (bulldozer, loader, grader, vibrator compactor, dump truck, sweeper, forklift.)
   6.6.2. A supervisor must be appointed to observe RRR operations.
   6.6.3. When using AM-2 mat the supervisor will instruct the forklift operator to position mat
   bundles to minimize carrying distances for work crews. The direction of the bundles should
   coincide with the direction the mat is being laid so crews don’t need to turn each piece of mat
   around. (The distance from the last row laid to the bundle is calculated so the bundle will be
   completed by the time the crew gets to that position laying the matting.)

      VEHICLE OPERATIONS, MATERIALS HANDLING EQUIPMENT (MHE) AND
                  AEROSPACE GROUND EQUIPMENT (AGE)

7.1. Vehicle Support. A basic bare base vehicle support package consists of about 60 vehicles,
primarily engineering and materials handling types. Vehicles are added to this package as
necessary depending on requirements. Additional packages may include M-series vehicles,
general-purpose vehicles, tractor-trailer sets, aircraft maintenance and support vehicles and small
quantities of RRR equipment. All of these assets are usually shipped into deployment locations
either from prepositioned stocks or MAJCOM assets. Vehicle support will likely be a genuine
limitation in day-to-day work efforts. Initially, most deployed general-purpose vehicles will not
be designated to specific organizations; they must support the entire base populace.
7.2. Built-Up Areas and Local Driving. Mishap experience shows local drivers, especially in
some overseas locations, to be very unpredictable, often showing complete disregard of traffic
signs, signals, and other forms of traffic control. Local weather conditions can also affect
driving. Vehicle and equipment operations, because of the hazards involved, should be closely
supervised.
   7.2.1. Tent City Sites.
        7.2.1.1. Limit parking, for fire safety reasons, to designated and authorized vehicle
        parking areas.
        7.2.1.2. Vehicles should not be parked between or next to tents or modular living units.
        7.2.1.3. The Tent City speed limits should be posted no more than 15 kilometers per hour
        (kph) or 10 miles per hour (mph).
        7.2.1.4. Perimeter and interior fire lanes will be kept clear.
        7.2.1.5. Personnel will wear safety belts when operating equipment.
   7.2.2. Construction Sites:
        7.2.2.1. Remind operators that construction equipment may be unstable when operated in
        sandy or rocky terrain.
        7.2.2.2. Ensure operators and supervisors check outriggers for stability. This is especially
        critical in sand or soil where a surface crust exists.
        7.2.2.3. Ensure rollover protection systems are installed and erect sun umbrellas on slow-
        speed equipment such as rollers and compactors.
        7.2.2.4. Ensure ground guides are used at construction sites and in congested areas and
        tent locations.
        7.2.2.5. Appoint a site safety supervisor for large earthwork or construction sites.
        7.2.2.6. Ensure hard-hats are worn at construction sites.
        7.2.2.7. Control vehicle, pedestrian, and troop access to sites.
        7.2.2.8. When excavating, ensure excavation walls are reinforced to prevent cave-ins.
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                      45


       7.2.2.9. Ensure all electrical equipment is grounded and bonded (if required) when
       transferring fuel.
       7.2.2.10. Ensure personal protective equipment (safety belts, goggles, gloves, welding
       masks, aprons, dust respirators, etc.) is available and used.
       7.2.2.11. Establish policies and procedures for recovery of equipment in sand, mud, or
       loose soil.
       7.2.2.12. Protect electrical wiring, hydraulics, and optics from abrasive effects of
       blowing sand, snow, rain, etc.
7.3. Vehicle Operations. Vehicle operations and military convoys can present unique hazards
for deployed personnel and local populations. Children especially, are invariably curious about
military convoys. This curiosity is amplified when military convoy members pass food or
trinkets to children. Children ca be killed or seriously injured while trying to retrieve handouts
from passing convoys. Although military personnel find it difficult to ignore needy children, for
their safety, this impulse must be restrained. The potential hazards associated with vehicle
operations require supervisors to take the following actions:
   7.3.1. Provide instruction about local driving customs and practices.
   7.3.2. Encourage drivers to avoid high civilian-vehicle concentration areas.
   7.3.3. Ensure all drivers are aware of local weather conditions and frequency, such as
   rainstorms, low areas, flash flooding, sandstorms, etc. and their effects on roads and traffic.
   7.3.4. Establish and enforce safe speed limits for various road and environmental conditions.
   7.3.5. Enforce the requirement to use safety belts (driver and all passengers.)
   7.3.6. Pair an experienced driver with an inexperienced one to provide supervision and
   hands-on training.
   7.3.7. Identify personnel who are not licensed to operate vehicles and ensure they are not
   tasked to drive.
   7.3.8. Instruct drivers on conditions that can lead to rollovers—steep slopes, ditches, loose
   sand, rocky terrain, etc.
   7.3.9. Ensure equipment is secure to prevent injury from falling equipment or cargo.
   7.3.10. Remind drivers to slow down when visibility is limited, on rough terrain, and during
   inclement weather.
   7.3.11. Caution drivers to avoid steep slopes and narrow trails (leaders must also keep this in
   mind when planning vehicle moves.)
   7.3.12. Remind drivers to give special care to tire, track, and suspension checks.
   7.3.13. Caution drivers to drive at moderate speed and make wide turns at slow speed to
   maintain vehicle control (especially critical in sand.)
   7.3.14. To avoid rear-end collisions:
       7.3.14.1. Stress safe following distances.

         7.3.14.2. Establish warning procedures for vehicle stops and breakdowns to warn
         approaching vehicles in blackout, sand-storm, and other restricted-visibility conditions.
   7.3.15. Advise personnel not to leave vehicles idling inside buildings or enclosed areas for
   extended periods of time to prevent carbon monoxide build-up.

   8.27.4. Is a 5 mph speed limit posted and enforced in the marshaling area?
   8.27.5. Do personnel remove jewelry when required?
   8.27.6. Are leather work gloves worn when personnel handle cargo or equipment?
   8.27.7. Is hearing protection worn on the flight line—either ear plugs, ear defenders, or
   both?
   8.27.8. Are personnel prohibited from standing in front of equipment when loading aircraft?

8.28. Deicing:
   8.28.1. Are aircraft deiced in the following manner:
      8.28.1.1. If deicing is performed while engines or auxiliary power units are running,
      ensure fluid is not applied or directed in a manner where the over-spray will contact
      engine intakes or sources of exhaust.
      8.28.1.2. All doors, hatches, and canopies are secured prior to deicing operations.
      8.28.1.3. Deicing fluid is not used to remove heavy accumulations of snow. (The snow
      absorbs the fluid and forms a slush that is difficult to remove. After snow is removed
      from the aircraft, a layer of rough ice remains, which can be quickly dispatched with
      deicing fluid.)
      8.28.1.4. Since deicing fluid is mildly toxic, are persons near the aircraft when it is being
      deiced placed upwind (as much as possible) of the application area?
      8.28.1.5. Before snow or ice removal from the empennage of the aircraft, are the
      stabilizers placed in the up position and the elevators in the down position? (If possible,
      the stabilizer and elevator should remain in this position for approximately 12.5 minutes
      to permit the draining of fluids from the surface.)
      8.28.1.6. As much as possible, is the deice truck placed in position to remove ice from
      the leading edge first?
      8.28.1.7. Is the spray of deicing fluid directed onto surfaces to be cleaned? The following
      actions should be taken:
          8.28.1.7.1. Do not direct the melted ice, snow, or slush into balance bays and do not
          allow stream to enter balance bays or be applied directly to honeycomb surfaces.
          8.28.1.7.2. Ensure balance bays are clear of accumulated snow and ice.
   8.28.2. Is the aircraft canopy or windshield cleaned before taxiing?
   8.28.3. Deicing operations will be conducted IAW applicable technical data.
 72                                                          AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


NOTE: Ensure deicing fluid does not drain into open bodies of water (ditched, streams,
lakes, etc.) where it may pollute and endanger aquatic life. Deicing fluid should be contained
and treated before discharge, when feasible.
8.29. Aircraft Hangar, Shelter, And Nose Dock Operations:
   8.29.1. Because working space is limited in hangars, the potential for tripping and falling
   over power cords, compressed air lines, and parts is ever present. Is the hangar cleared, as
   much as possible, of these hazards?
   8.29.2. Many tasks require manual lifting, some in awkward positions that can be stressful to
   body parts. Are proper lifting techniques used and, when possible, help given to accomplish
   the task?
   8.29.3. Do hangar doors operate properly, with working audible warning?
   8.29.4. Do individuals clean up the tools and equipment they have used and ensure tripping
   hazards are eliminated from work areas?
   8.29.5. Are aircraft panels, cowlings, and other parts relocated to storage areas when not in
   use?
   8.29.6. Are electrical cords and compressed air lines placed in storage areas when not in
   use?
   8.29.7. When walking or working on aircraft in hangars, nose docks, shelters, etc., or when
   workers perform maintenance on exterior aircraft surfaces that are over 10 feet in height, is
   fall protection used?
   8.29.8. Are safety harnesses, when used, inspected prior to use?
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                      73

   and specific risks personnel and resources are being exposed to. Document compensatory
   action taken to abate hazards.
9.2. Ammunition and Explosives:
   9.2.1. General Precautions: (See AFMAN 91-201, General Guidance, Chapter 2)
      9.2.1.1. Expose only the minimum number of people to the minimum amount of
      explosives for the minimum amount of time.
      9.2.1.2. Handle ammunition carefully. Containers must not be tumbled, dropped, thrown,
      rolled, or dragged (unless designed for dragging).
      9.2.1.3. Make provisions to evaluate and, if necessary, segregate damaged ammunition.
      9.2.1.4. Caution personnel not to disassemble or destroy enemy equipment or
      ammunition without authorization. Unknown ammunition stocks should be carefully
      examined by ordnance experts before demolition or shipment.

        9.2.1.9. Keep the area within 50 feet of ammunition clear of vegetation, refuse, empty
        packing materials, and other hazards that could cause a fire to spread to the ammunition.
        9.2.1.10. Keep water filled barrels or tubs at locations where white phosphorus (WP) or
        powered white phosphorus (PWP) ammunition is kept. These barrels and tubs are used to
        immerse leaking WP or PWP round and for first-aid for WP or PWP burns.
        9.2.1.11. Store ammunition in dugouts or depressions below ground level to reduce
        exposure to heat.
     9.2.2. Unexploded Ordnance (UXO):
        9.2.2.1. Remind personnel not to touch, pick up, attempt to disarm, or otherwise disturb
        any UXO, dud ordnance, or any unknown object they might come across. Tell them to
        mark the location to warn others and report it immediately to Explosive Ordnance
        Disposal (EOD) through their chain of command.
        9.2.2.2. Do not allow personnel to collect duds for souvenirs.
        9.2.2.3. Notify adjacent units prior to EOD destroying UXO to avoid transmission of
        false alarms. Remind personnel to:
            9.2.2.3.1. Make any radio transmission at least 25 feet away for hand-held and 100
            feet away for mobile radios from a UXO hazard.
            9.2.2.3.2. Do not move toward a suspected UXO. Some types have magnetic or
            motion-sensitive fuses and will detonate when they detect a target. Other types have
            self-destruct timers.
  9.2.3. Fire Precautions:
        9.2.3.1. Ensure smoking is not permitted within 50 feet of explosives and that flame
        producing devices are turned over to entry control in areas containing exposed
        explosives.
        9.2.3.2. Ensure fire extinguishers (at least two portable 2A:10BC Rated) are present
        whenever ammunition is handled, stored, or transported.
     9.2.4. Loading Precautions:
        9.2.4.1. Ensure vehicle brakes are set and the engine is turned off during loading and
        unloading. If the vehicle is parked on any grade or ramp steep enough to cause vehicle to
        roll chocks will be used.
        9.2.4.2. Ensure ammunition weight is evenly distributed and the load is secured to
        prevent movement.
        9.2.4.3. Ensure vehicles and trailers loaded with ammunition are parked at least 50 feet
        from vehicles and trailers loaded with flammable liquids.
     9.2.5. Storage Precautions:
        9.2.5.1. Protect ammunition, particularly unpackaged ammunition, from direct sun.
        However, tarpaulins or other covers placed directly on ammunition can cause
        deterioration, so a ventilation space must be provided.
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                         77


      9.2.5.2. Disperse ammunition to minimize loss in the event of fire, accidental explosion,
      or enemy action.
      9.2.5.3. Conform to quantity-distance standards for storage of ammunition and
      explosives.
      9.2.5.4. Ensure that captured ammunition and ammunition of unknown origin is
      examined, evaluated, and classified by qualified personnel and stored in a designated
      collection point.
      9.2.5.5. When storing ammunition, use sand dunes, barriers, buildings, and so forth to
      prevent propagation and to protect personnel and material from the effects of an
      explosion.
   9.2.6. Pyrotechnics:
      9.2.6.1. Ensure personnel know that simulator flash powder ignites instantly and
      explosively and that simulators should not be exposed to intense heat and direct sunlight.
      Remind personnel never to cut open or hand-ignite these devices and to mark duds and
      seek EOD guidance for handling and disposal.
      9.2.6.2. Remind personnel, while training, not to throw or detonate simulators, flares, or
      smoke devices near troops, tents, vehicles, or other flammable or combustible materials.
      (See AFMAN 91-201, Para 2.15 for published safety guidelines.)
      9.2.6.3. Remind personnel to roll down sleeves and wear gloves and helmets when using
      simulators.

                                    COMMUNICATIONS

10.1. Introduction. Working near, installing, and repairing communications and electrical
equipment present potential hazards to personnel. The following checklist addresses minimal
safety requirements.
10.2. Antennas:
   10.2.1. Remind personnel that, when erecting antennas, they must stay twice the distance
   from power lines as the length of the antenna.
   10.2.2. Stress that personnel have been killed by falling antenna-head sections.
   10.2.3. Require that personnel wear eye and face protection and gloves when erecting
   antennas.
   10.2.4. Allow no substitutes for antenna-mast sections (camouflage poles have been a fatal
   alternative).
   10.2.5. If, for any reason, an assembled antenna-head must be left on the ground, ensure it is
   guarded to prevent others from walking into it. Tip protectors are a must.
   10.2.6. Ensure radio frequency radiation hazard distances prescribed by technical data are
   marked and access is restricted.
10.3. Power Lines:
   10.3.1. Identify power lines in operational areas to all personnel.
   10.3.2. Tie down antennas when in areas of power lines (antenna tip should be no lower than
   7 feet to avoid eye injuries). Use tip protectors at all times.
   10.3.3. Ensure electrical service lines comply with AFMAN 91-201, para 2.48.
10.4. Electrical Storms:
   10.4.1. If possible, do not operate radios, telephones, or switchboards during electrical
   storms.
   10.4.2. Disconnect electrical equipment from power sources and antennas, if the situation
   permits.
   10.4.3. If equipment must be used, converse as little as possible. Return the call after the
   storm.

11.1. Heat Effects on Tools and Materials:
   11.1.1. Ensure gloves are worn when working with metal tools and materials exposed to the
   sun in hot climates.
   11.1.2. Remind personnel to:
       11.1.2.1. Take into account expansion and contraction of metal tools and materials.
       (Metal will contract during cool nights and expand during hot days).
       11.1.2.2. Check wire rope and bolt torque specifications to minimize varying heat stress
       and strain effects.
       11.1.2.3. Keep sawdust cleaned up in carpentry areas. Sawdust fires occur frequently in
       hot, dry climates.
       11.1.2.4. Frequently inspect wooden items such as shovel, ax, and hammer handles for
       shrinkage from extreme heat and low humidity. Check and tighten as needed.

                                           Chapter 12

                        CLIMATE AND WEATHER CONDITIONS

12.1. Climate and Weather.
   12.1.1. Environmental Considerations. Unfamiliar environmental conditions can severely
   affect deployment and contingency operations. Environmental extremes usually require
   specialized techniques, procedures, and equipment. Every effort should be made to determine
   the appropriate measures and equipment that may be needed at the deployed location to
   protect workers and minimize the impact of the environment.
12.2. Worldwide Considerations. Planning guidelines for the effects of climate and weather
vary with the location of the contingency.
12.3. Desert Areas and Southwest Asia (SWA.)
   12.3.1. Hot-dry conditions are found in desert climates and it is not uncommon for
   temperatures to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit daily for long periods. Substantial desert
   areas on all continents have long periods where temperatures well above 100 degrees
   Fahrenheit may exist during the hottest months. Operating equipment in direct sunshine can
   expose workers to temperatures 30 to 50 degrees higher than the shade temperature.
   12.3.2. Since SWA receives very little rain, precipitation is not considered as a significant
   factor. However, sudden and intense rains occurring several miles away may cause flash
   flooding in another distant location. Operations in areas where there is a potential for
   standing water after a rainfall should be avoided. A thorough terrain analysis should reveal
   natural drainage swales subject to flash flooding.
       12.3.2.1. Winds in SWA and other desert climates can achieve almost gale force and
       blowing dust and sand can make life almost intolerable, any type of activity difficult, and
       restrict visibility to a few yards. Strong winds are invariably followed by rapid changes in
       temperature.
       12.3.2.2. Burial of utility lines, and shading of fuel bladders, generators, and vehicles
       should be considered to reduce the effects of intense sunlight in desert climates. Cool
       areas where personnel can retreat during breaks or work-rest periods should also be
       established.
12.4. Temperate Zones. The temperate zone extends throughout the world and, very generally,
includes the variable climates of the middle latitudes, between the extremes of the tropical and
frigid climates. Climates are typically seasonal and can range from hot-dry and cold regions.
Rains may be accompanied by gusty winds during much of the year. Snow and icing conditions
are not uncommon in these areas during the winter months. During fall, winter, and early spring,
fog may be common and visibility can be severely restricted.
12.5. Tropical Zones. Wet-warm regions in the tropical zone coincide with the major tropical
rain forest areas of the world. Wet-warm to hot conditions prevail characterized by high
temperature and humidity, and intense solar radiation. Low temperatures do not occur, but chilly
days and nights are common. In some tropical areas, in winter months (the reverse season below
the equator), the nights are cold enough to require a wool blanket for sleeping. Rainfall in many
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                       87


parts of the tropics is much greater than that in most areas of the temperate zones. Tropical
downpours usually are followed by clear skies, and in most places the rains are predictable at
certain times of the day. Except in those areas where rainfall may be continuous during the rainy
season there are not many days when the sun does not shine at least part of the time.
12.6. Frigid Zone. Frigid zone conditions are found in the northern hemisphere. Deep snow,
permafrost, seasonally frozen ground, frozen lakes and rivers, glaciers, and extreme cold
characterize these far northern regions. Besides climatic effects, vast distances and isolation can
influence bare base operations in northern areas. Frequent high winds and either very short or
very long periods of daylight prevail. There is constant need for shelter and heat, increased
dependence on special equipment and materials, and a need for special winter clothing. Cold
temperatures make even simple tasks very difficult. During the summer, this zone may be
characterized by numerous and extensive swamps, lakes, rivers, abundant insects, and at times,
continuous daylight. Spring hazards include flash floods from melting snow and ice. Freeze-thaw
cycles occur frequently. Personnel accustomed to operating in warm weather should be properly
trained and prepared for frigid conditions, which should include operation of special-purpose
equipment such as snow removal machinery and portable duct heaters. This training should also
include winterization of standard bare base assets. Operation and maintenance of vehicles, power
equipment, and utility systems in very low temperatures is difficult. Extreme cold may result in
rapid deterioration of metal, plastic, and other materials. Special lubricants may be required, as
well as antifreezes, protective covers, and warming equipment.
   12.6.1. Temperatures. While temperatures vary considerably between locations during the
   winter season, six continuous hours with an ambient air temperature of minus 50 degrees
   Fahrenheit can be expected in the extreme northern parts of the frigid zone. Summer
   maximum temperature expectancy is 95 degrees Fahrenheit, well inland.
12.7. Adverse Weather Conditions. Deployed weather personnel or the base weather station
(BWS) is responsible for making the initial notification to pre-determined support agencies of
adverse weather conditions. Adverse weather conditions include: strong surface winds, heavy
rain, freezing precipitation, and thunderstorms (i.e., frequent dangerous lightning, damaging
winds, and hail).
12.8. General Lightning Safety for All AF Activities and Operations:
   12.8.1. When lightning is detected or observed within the immediate vicinity of any activity
   or operation, do not go out of doors or remain out unless it is absolutely necessary. Take
   appropriate precautions even though the thunderstorm may not be directly overhead. If you
   are caught outside:
       12.8.1.1. Do not stand near a tall isolated tree or a telephone pole.
       12.8.1.2. Avoid projecting above the surrounding landscape. For example, don’t stand on
       a hilltop.
       12.8.1.3. In a forest, seek shelter under a thick growth of small trees.
       12.8.1.4. In open areas, go to a low place, such as a ravine or valley.
       12.8.1.5. Get off or away from open water, metal equipment, or small metal vehicles.
       12.8.1.6. Avoid metal objects including fences, metal pipes, electrical lines, equipment,
       etc.
88                                                             AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


        12.8.1.7. If you are in a group in the open, spread out, keeping people several yards
        apart.
        12.8.1.8. If you are caught in a level field or prairie far from shelter and you feel your
        hair stand on end, lightning may be about to strike. Crouch down with feet and knees
        together hunched slightly forward and place your hands over ears to minimize potential
        hearing damage from thunder. DO NOT LIE FLAT ON THE GROUND.
     12.8.2. Seek shelter as follows:
        12.8.2.1. Dwellings or other buildings that are protected against lightning;
        12.8.2.2. Protected underground shelters;
        12.8.2.3. Large metal-framed buildings;
        12.8.2.4. Enclosed automobiles, buses, aircraft, and other vehicles with metal tops and
        bodies;
        12.8.2.5. Streets that may be shielded by nearby buildings.
  12.8.3. Certain locations are extremely hazardous during thunderstorms and these should be
  avoided:
        12.8.3.1. Hilltops and ridges;
        12.8.3.2. Areas on top of buildings;
        12.8.3.3. Under isolated trees;
        12.8.3.4. Near electrical appliances, telephones, plumbing fixtures, and metal or
        electrically conductive objects; and
        12.8.3.5. Aircraft dry bays, tanks, and wheel wells.
  12.8.4. Each Deployment Commander will ensure a local procedure is developed to advise
  key personnel and notify agencies involved in high-risk weather activities and operations.
  Normally, these agencies are those having aircraft, POL facilities, open-air work and
  recreational activities, and underground utilities work. Key personnel, in turn, will advise all
  on-duty supervisors to take proper precautions and timely actions.
  12.8.5. Each location will have a lightning safety program with a two-tier notification
  system to minimize personnel exposure to lightning hazards.
        12.8.5.1. A Lightning Watch is in effect 30 minutes prior to thunderstorms being within a
        5-nautical mile (nm) radius of any pre-determined location or activity as forecast by the
        BWS or deployed weather personnel. NOTE: Lightning is a direct product of a
        thunderstorm. During a Lightning Watch, accomplish the following:
            12.8.5.1.1. Continue operations or activities; however, ensure all personnel are
            prepared to implement Lightning Warning procedures without delay.
            12.8.5.1.2. Be alert for any lightning activity, to include audible thunder, and advise
            supervisory personnel of any observations.
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                     89


       12.8.5.2. A Lighting Warning is in effect whenever any lightning is occurring within a 5-
       nm radius of the pre-determined locations and activities. Personnel in affected locations
       or engaged in affected activities will take the following actions:
           12.8.5.2.1. Cease all outside activities and seek shelter.
           12.8.5.2.2. Recommended locations that provide safe shelter and locations to avoid
           are listed in paragraphs 12.8.2 and 12.8.3.
       12.8.5.3. If lightning does not occur within a 5-nm radius at the valid (forecast) time of
       the Lightning Watch, BWS or deployed weather personnel will reassess the Lightning
       Watch and amend as needed. Lightning Warnings will be canceled when the
       thunderstorms have passed beyond the 5-nm radius of the location or activity. A
       Lightning Watch will not be canceled if there is potential for more thunderstorms within
       30 minutes.
       12.8.5.4. All aircraft fuel servicing and maintenance activities (including Liquid Oxygen
       [LOX] servicing) will cease whenever a Lightning Warning is in effect. EXCEPTIONS:
       Vehicle movements (including refuelers) and pipeline transfers (including bulk storage to
       hydrant tanks).
12.9. Safeguarding Aircraft During High Winds. Serious structural damage to aircraft can be
caused by high velocity surface winds. When possible, aircraft will be evacuated to safe weather
areas when tornadoes, hurricanes, or unusually high winds are predicted. Locally established
high wind safety precautions or plans will be developed and observed along with the guidance
presented below:
   12.9.1. Taxiing Aircraft. Taxiing aircraft during unusually high winds will be avoided. They
   may be taxied at the discretion of the deployment commander when the action will lessen the
   possibility of aircraft damage.
   12.9.2. Outside Parking. If possible, light aircraft will be parked inside hangars. Aircraft
   parked outside will be positioned face into the wind and tied down. Transient aircraft will be
   tied down as directed by the aircraft commander or applicable aircraft technical data.
   12.9.3. High Winds. When wind velocity exceeds 30 knots (sustained or gusts), light aircraft
   in temporary docks or extending outside the hangars will be towed clear and parked in
   compliance with applicable aircraft technical data. When wind velocity exceeds 50 knots
   (sustained or gusts), medium or heavy aircraft in temporary docks or extending outside the
   hangars will be towed clear and then parked in compliance with applicable aircraft technical
   data.
   12.9.4. Work Materials. All maintenance equipment, work stands, loose aircraft parts, and
   materials not in use will be removed from the parking area and stored in a safe area.
   Equipment remaining outside will be secured against wind movement.
   12.9.5. Personnel. When winds reach hazardous velocities, activities other than those
   required to safeguard the aircraft will be avoided. Guidance for actions involving electrical
   storms is found in paragraph 4.2.

12.10. Cold Weather-Related Injuries:
      12.10.1. Chilblain:
         12.10.1.1. Definition. A nonfreezing cold injury, which, while painful, causes little or no
         permanent impairment.
         12.10.1.2. Symptoms. Appears as red, swollen skin, which is tender, hot to the touch,
         and may itch. This can worsen to an aching, prickly (―pins and needles‖) sensation, and
         then numbness. It can develop in only a few hours to skin exposed to moist cold
         conditions.
         12.10.1.3. First Aid. Prevent further exposure; remove wet, constrictive clothing; and
         wash and dry the injury gently. Elevate the injured area and warm by applying layers of
         loose warm clothing or blankets, (expect pain and blisters may develop). Do NOT pop
         blisters, apply lotions or creams, massage, expose to extreme heat, or allow victim to
         walk on the injury. Seek medical treatment.
      12.10.2. Frostbite:
         12.10.2.1. Definition. Frostbite is a severe reaction to cold exposure that can cause
         permanent damage. The combination of wind and cold temperatures attacking
         unprotected skin is the main cause of frostbite. When skin is exposed to the cold, blood
         vessels in the skin clamp down or constrict. As a result of a decreased blood flow to the
         skin, the fluid in and around skin cells develops ice crystals, which causes frostbite to
         occur. The areas most likely to get frostbitten are cheeks, ears, noses, fingers, toes and
         feet. The extent of injury caused by exposure depends on wind velocity, duration and
         type of exposure, temperature, and humidity. Wind chill (a calculation of the adjusted
         temperature because of air temperature and wind speed) can help determine the
         possibility of frostbite (see Table 12.1).
         12.10.2.2. Symptoms. Just before frostbite occurs, the affected skin may be slightly
         flushed. As frostbite develops, the skin appearance changes to white or grayish-yellow.
         Pain is sometimes felt early but subsides later (often no pain is felt.) The affected area
         feels intensely cold and numb. The victim frequently is not aware of frostbite until
         someone points out the change in skin color or the victim sees the skin changes and feels
         the pain of frostbite once indoors, away from cold exposure.
         12.10.2.3. First Aid. Prevent further exposure; remove wet, constrictive clothing.
         Rewarm gradually by direct skin-to-skin contact between injured area and noninjured
         skin of the victim or a buddy. Evacuate for medical treatment (foot injuries by litter.) Do
         not allow the injury to refreeze during evacuation. NOTE: Do not rewarm a frostbite
         injury if it could refreeze during evacuation; do not rewarm frostbitten feet if the victim
         must walk for medical treatment; and do NOT rewarm injury over an open flame.
      12.10.3. Trenchfoot:
         12.10.3.1. Definition. Trenchfoot is a very serious nonfreezing cold injury which
         develops when skin of the feet is exposed to moisture and cold for prolonged periods (12
         hours or longer). The combination of cold and moisture softens skin, causing tissue loss
         and, often, infection. Untreated, trenchfoot can eventually require amputation. The risk of
         this potentially crippling injury is high during wet weather or when troops are deployed
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                                      91


        in wet areas. Personnel wearing rubberized or tight-fitting boots are at risk for trenchfoot
        regardless of weather conditions, since sweat accumulates inside these boots and keeps
        the feet wet.
        12.10.3.2. Symptoms. Often, the first sign of trenchfoot is itching, numbness, or tingling
        pain. Later the feet may appear swollen, and the skin mildly red, blue, or black.
        Commonly, trenchfoot shows a distinct "water-line" coinciding with the water level in
        the boot. Red or bluish blotches appear on the skin, sometimes with open weeping or
        bleeding.
        12.10.3.3. First Aid. Prevent further exposure; remove wet, constrictive clothing; wash
        and dry injury gently. Elevate injury , cover with layers of loose, warm clothing, and
        allow to rewarm (pain and blisters may develop.) Do not pop blisters, apply lotions or
        creams, massage, expose to extreme heat, or allow victim to walk on injury. Refer for
        medical treatment.

EFFECT
     12.10.4. Hypothermia:
        12.10.4.1. Definition. A condition brought on when the body cannot produce heat as fast
        as it is being lost. Hypothermia is a life-threatening condition in which deep-body
        temperature falls below 95 degrees F. Many people do not understand how dangerous
        hypothermia is or how fast it can set in. When your body starts losing heat faster than it
        can produce it, exposure has started. If exposure continues long enough, it leads to
        hypothermia.
92                                                          AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


         12.10.4.1.1. Wet skin and wind accelerate body heat loss and the body produces less
         heat during inactive periods. Body temperature can fall even when air temperatures
         are above freezing, if conditions are windy, clothing is wet, and the individual is
         inactive.
         12.10.4.1.2. Victims normally do not notice the signs of hypothermia in themselves.
         Therefore, it’s up to other members to be alert for symptoms. Even mild hypothermia
         can cause victims to make poor decisions or act intoxicated (removing clothing when
         it is clearly inappropriate, trying to start a fire in the rain, etc.).
     12.10.4.2. Symptoms. Symptoms can include a puffy face, uncontrollable shivering,
     mental confusion and slow or slurred speech, memory lapses, incoherence, frequent
     stumbling, slow breathing, slow heart, drowsiness, exhaustion, withdrawn or bizarre
     behavior, irritability, and the abdominal area is cold to touch.
     12.10.4.3. First Aid. A person showing these symptoms needs immediate treatment. If a
     person is alert and shivering, they probably are only suffering from mild hypothermia.
     They may deny there is a problem, but someone needs to take control and do the
     following (NOTE: If shivering has stopped, or the person is unconscious, severe
     hypothermia is probably present and the person requires immediate emergency medical
     intervention): Prevent further exposure (wind, rain, or cold); remove wet clothing and
     replace with warm dry clothes. Warm victims by covering them with blankets, sleeping
     bags, etc., body-to-body contact can also provide warmth. Do not let the victim sleep;
     initiate Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), only if required. Sometimes the heart beat
     and breathing of hypothermia victims is so faint it can go undetected, victims may also
     show no response to touch or pain. Handle gently during treatment and evacuation,
     because rough handling can cause life-threatening disruptions in heart rate. Get medical
     attention as soon as possible.
  12.10.5. Prevention of Cold-Related Injuries. Following are suggestions for preventing cold-
  related injuries (chilblain, frostbite, and hypothermia):
     12.10.5.1. If possible, limit the duration of exposure to extreme cold.
     12.10.5.2. Always wear proper protective clothing, which may include an extra wool or
     insulated socks, warm boots, and wind- and water-repellent outer-gear. Wear mittens
     instead of gloves. Wear head and face covering to retain heat (as much as 70 percent or
     more of the body’s heat can be lost through radiation and convection from an uncovered
     head).
     12.10.5.3. Wear several layers of clothing, rather than one or two ―bulky‖ layers. Air is
     trapped between these layers and acts as insulation against the cold. Clothing filled with
     wool, down, and synthetic foams may assist in the retention of body heat.
     12.10.5.4. Drink warm liquids like soup.
     12.10.5.5. Eat nutritious, high-energy foods. Eat at least one hot meal a day. Exercise
     regularly to stimulate heat production in your muscles.
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                     93


      12.10.5.6. Avoid:
          12.10.5.6.1. Caffeine and tobacco use, as these leave the skin more prone to thermal
          injury (caffeine may contribute to heat loss and smoking slows down blood
          circulation to the extremities).
          12.10.5.6.2. Taking medication (some combinations of drugs can lower the body’s
          resistance to the cold). Seek professional medical advice when taking medications.
          12.10.5.6.3. Alcohol use, because it increases heat loss and distorts the senses,
          including the sense of how much time has been spent in the cold. Drinking alcohol
          lowers the body’s temperature and dulls awareness to the cold. The person consuming
          the alcohol may perceive they are warmer, while in reality they may be contributing
          to greater cold injury.
          12.10.5.6.4. Wet clothing, shoes, or socks, as they may further contribute to loss of
          body heat. Try to change wet footgear and clothing as soon as practically possible.
12.11. Cold Weather-Related Personal Protection. Often personnel focus on recognizing and
treating cold-weather injuries rather than preventing them. Consequently, the first-line
supervisor will ensure the following actions are taken to prevent cold-related injuries:
   12.11.1. Check personnel for proper dress (gloves, head protection, loose, layered clothing).
   12.11.2. Ensure personnel properly remove layers of clothing as the temperature changes.
   12.11.3. Never allow personnel to unnecessarily wear wet clothing.
   12.11.4. Require personnel to change socks regularly.
   12.11.5. Identify and closely monitor personnel who have previously suffered a cold-
   weather injury, as they are more susceptible.
   12.11.6. Ensure personnel practice proper hygiene.
   12.11.7. Do not allow personnel to sleep in confined areas with vehicle-engines running.
      12.11.7.1. Brief personnel on the symptoms of carbon-monoxide poisoning.
   12.11.8. Ensure personnel are aware of hypothermia hazards.
   12.11.9. Make sure personnel know that alcohol gives a ―sensation‖ of warmth, but it
   increases loss of body heat.
   12.11.10. Consistent with mission accomplishment, keep personnel’s duration and exposure
   to cold to a minimum.
   12.11.11. Ensure personnel know exposure to freezing temperatures with foot perspiration
   may cause frostbite.
   12.11.12. Require that personnel wear non slip footwear (insulated if necessary) for wet,
   snowy, or icy surfaces.
   12.11.13. Make sure provisions are in place to warn personnel of adverse weather.
   12.11.14. Encourage use of the ―buddy system‖ to help detect signs of cold related injury
   and illness in others.
 94                                                            AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


   12.11.15. Personnel should wear dry socks and footwear. Socks should be changed at least
   daily. Standing for long periods in cold water should be avoided.
12.12. Heat Stress Disorders and Prevention. Heat stress is the combination of environment
and physical work factors that constitute the total heat load imposed on the body. The
environmental heat stress factors are air temperature, radiant heat exchange (example, sunlight),
air movement, and relative humidity. Physical work contributes to total heat stress through the
body's production of heat (metabolic heat) as it burns energy to sustain the work. This production
of metabolic heat depends on the intensity of the physical effort that is affected, in turn, by body
size, muscular development, physical fitness, and age. As environmental temperatures approach
normal skin temperature, cooling of the body becomes more difficult. These conditions adversely
affect an individual’s ability to work in a hot environment, especially when conditions of high
humidity exist. Personnel who must perform delicate or detailed work may find their accuracy
suffering, and others may find that their ability to comprehend and retain information decreases.
As a result, certain safety problems are common to hot environments—slipperiness of sweaty
palms, dizziness, or the fogging of safety glasses. If there are hot metal surfaces or steam, the
possibility of burns also exists. Increased body temperature and physical discomfort promote
irritability, anger, and other emotional states, which can cause workers to overlook safety
procedures or divert their attention from hazardous tasks.
   12.12.1. Heat Stress Disorders. Heat stress disorders or heat disorders are general terms used
   to indicate any type of adverse health problem related to heat. Heat syncope, cramps,
   exhaustion, and stroke are all forms of heat stress disorders. Heat disorders may be
   recognized by one or more of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, fever, dizziness,
   headache, faintness, abnormal sweating, convulsions, lack of coordination, mental confusion,
   and abdominal or leg cramps. The personnel most likely to be affected by the heat are those
   who have just arrived from cooler regions of the country, are obese, or are in poor condition.
   A list of heat stress disorders follows:
       12.12.1.1. Heat Cramps. These are painful intermittent spasms of the muscles used
       during work (arms, legs, or abdominal) that may occur during or after work hours.
       Cramps may result from exposure to high temperature for a relatively long time,
       particularly if accompanied by hard physical work. Cramps usually occur in
       unacclimatized personnel after heavy sweating and are the result of excessive loss of salt
       from the body. Even if the moisture is replaced by drinking water, the loss of salt by
       sweating may provoke heat cramps.
       12.12.1.2. Heat Exhaustion. The signs of heat exhaustion are profuse sweating,
       weakness, rapid pulse, dizziness, nausea, and headache. The body temperature is elevated
       with heat exhaustion, although not to the same degree as with heat stroke. Heat
       exhaustion is caused by a deficiency of water and (or) salt intake and circulatory strain
       from competing demands for blood flow to the skin and to active muscles. Heat
       exhaustion can rapidly progress to heat stroke if not treated immediately.
       12.12.1.3. Heat Stroke. Heat stroke is a medical emergency and is caused by exposure to
       a hot environment in which the body is unable to cool itself sufficiently. This results in
       the body temperature rising rapidly. With classic heat stroke, hot dry skin may be present.
       This should be anticipated in older or debilitated individuals. With exertional heat stroke,
       sweating continues. It is often preceded by nausea or vomiting, abnormal shivering, and
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                    95


     (or) confused mental status with slurred speech. In highly motivated individuals, the only
     sign before collapse and unconsciousness may be heavy sweating. Increased body
     temperature, if uncontrolled, may lead to delirium, convulsions, coma, and even death.
     Heat stroke is a much more serious condition than either heat cramps or heat exhaustion.
     12.12.1.4. Heat Syncope. This is the fainting that occurs immediately after exertion
     without proper cool down or while standing erect and immobile in heat. Caused by
     pooling of the blood in dilated vessels and the lower parts of the body.
     12.12.1.5. Hyponatremia (Acute Water Intoxication). This is a condition in which the
     level of sodium in the blood is markedly lowered as a result of sodium lost in sweat,
     coupled with fluid replacement using only large volumes of plain water (greater than 1
     1/2 quarts per hour). This is a medical emergency. Hyponatremia is a life-threatening
     condition that may result in confusion, fatigue, muscle cramps, and nausea early on,
     followed later by vomiting, unconsciousness, seizures, and death if not recognized and
     treated promptly. This condition is difficult to distinguish from heat exhaustion and heat
     stroke, and if suspected should be treated immediately in a medical facility.
  12.12.2. Heat Stress and Water Intoxication Warning Signs and Symptoms. Brief
  supervisors and workers on the signs and symptoms of heat stress disorders and how to
  minimize the effects of heat stress during operations, training exercises, and when personnel
  wear the ground crew chemical defense ensemble or other similarly impermeable clothing.
  Consult with aerospace physiology or bioenvironmental engineering for additional
  assistance, if needed.
     12.12.2.1. Early Signs and Symptoms Actions:
         12.12.2.1.1. Early signs include dizziness, headache, dry mouth, unsteady walk,
         weakness, and muscle cramps. Personnel displaying these symptoms should be
         removed from operations or training, allowed to rest in shade and given sips of water.
         If signs or symptoms do not improve in 15 to 30 minutes, transport to a medical
         facility. If signs or symptoms worsen, call for an ambulance.
     12.12.2.2. Later Signs and Symptoms Immediate Actions:
         12.12.2.2.1. The following symptoms may indicate advanced signs of heat stress
         disorders: Hot body, high temperature; confusion, unresponsiveness, coma; vomiting;
         involuntary bowel movement; convulsions, a weak or rapid pulse. If personnel
         display such symptoms call an ambulance for immediate transport to a hospital, lay
         the person down in shade with their feet elevated until the ambulance arrives. Give
         sips of water while waiting for the ambulance. Begin active cooling, if skin is hot to
         touch by undressing the victim as much as possible, pouring cool water on them, and
         fanning them.
  12.12.3. Acclimatization. Personnel should be acclimated to heat exposures. Employees who
  are acclimatized to heat can work better. Acclimatization is a period of adjustment an
  individual’s body requires to become accustomed to working in hot environments. Full
  acclimatization occurs through progressive degrees of heat exposure and physical exertion.
  Personnel may need 2 weeks of increasing exposures to become substantially acclimated and
  may retain most of their adaptation for about 1 week after leaving a hot climate. Personnel in
96                                                          AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


  good physical condition acclimatize more quickly. For personnel needing acclimatization,
  supervisors should adjust work schedules to provide progressive exposure to heat.
     12.12.3.1. The human body is comfortable at about 75 degrees F with 45 percent relative
     humidity. Comfort is determined by the amount of activity, the relative humidity, and the
     amount of air movement—all variables that affect the rate at which the body loses heat. It
     takes 1 to 2 weeks for a person’s body to adjust to a region’s humidity and extreme heat.
     12.12.3.2. Sweating can also maintain a stable body temperature if the humidity level is
     low enough to permit evaporation and if the fluids and salts lost are adequately replaced.
     An individual who is heat acclimated may perspire almost twice as much as an
     unacclimatized individual. One of the effects of acclimatization is to allow an individual
     to begin perspiration earlier in the course of exercise; this allows for a quick, effective,
     and efficient beginning to heat dissipation and alleviation of early heat buildup. When the
     body cannot release heat, it stores it. This raises the core temperature and heart rate
     putting health at risk.
  12.12.4. Sunburn. Sunburn can be a painful skin condition, which occurs as a result of
  overexposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun. Sunburn affects the body’s ability to cool
  itself and causes a loss of body fluids. It also causes pain and damages the skin. Ultraviolet
  (UV) rays react with a chemical called melanin that’s found in most people’s skin; the darker
  the skin color, the more melanin the skin contains to protect itself. Fair skinned personnel
  face an increased risk from sunburn. Sunburn develops when the amount of ultraviolet
  exposure exceeds what the skin can protect against. Even on cloudy, cool, or overcast days,
  UV rays travel through the clouds and reflect off materials, such as sand, water, snow, and
  concrete. This ―invisible sun‖ can cause unexpected sunburn and skin damage.
     12.12.4.1. Symptoms include: Red skin that’s warm to touch; skin may be blistered or
     swollen (blistering may occur several days after exposure. Severe reactions (sometimes
     called ―sun poisoning‖) may include fever, chills, nausea, or rash; and sunburned skin
     may peel several days after the sunburn.
     12.12.4.2. First Aid: Apply cold compresses or immerse the sunburned area in cool water
     (baking soda in the water may help relieve the pain); apply a soothing moisturizing lotion
     to affected areas; take aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen to relieve pain, headache, and
     to reduce fever. Use an over-the-counter topical steroid cream if the pain persists. Drink
     plenty of water to replace fluid loss. Do NOT apply petroleum jelly, ointment or butter
     (they make the symptoms worse and do not allow air to assist in healing). Avoid using
     local anesthetic creams or sprays, they may cause allergic reactions in some persons. Do
     NOT break blisters or wash burned skin with harsh soap.
     12.12.4.3. Prevention. Sun radiation is very intense when the sun is highest overhead and
     is, therefore, the strongest. UV rays are strongest during summer months. When traveling
     to a distant location during the summer season, strong sun protection is important.
     Locations near the equator and at high altitudes require additional protection, because the
     air and cloud cover are thinner, allowing more damaging rays to get through the
     atmosphere.
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                     97


         12.12.4.3.1. Use sunscreen with a sun protective factor (SPF) of 30 or higher; lighter
         skin may require a higher SPF. Sunscreens rated higher than 15 SPF are usually less
         soluble and last longer. Apply sunscreen 30 minutes before going outdoors and
         reapply according to package directions. Give special attention to face, nose, ears, and
         shoulders. CAUTION: Some sunscreens cause eye pain and temporary blindness if
         they contact the eyes (usually when sweat mixed with sunscreen runs into the eyes.)
         Sunscreens that do not sting the eyes are available.
         12.12.4.3.2. Use a lip balm with sunscreen. Use a lip balm with a SPF.
         12.12.4.3.3. Wear clothing and a hat that covers the body and face. The hat, if
         possible, should completely shadow the face.
         12.12.4.3.4. Wear sunglasses with UV protection whenever possible.
         12.12.4.3.5. Be aware that some medications increase the skin’s sensitivity to UV
         rays. Ask medical personnel if this is the case when given medications as a result of
         travel to certain locations. Antibiotics, antihistamines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
         agents, tranquilizers, diuretics, and antidepressants are among the medications that
         can increase sun sensitivity.
  12.12.5. Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) Index. The WBGT index is used to measure
  the potential for heat stress injury. The WBGT index is a combination of temperature
  measurements, which considers dry air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and
  radiant heating. The heat index usually mentioned in weather forecasts is the "effective
  temperature" which only factors temperature and relative humidity. The effective
  temperature does not adequately account for environmental factors or human physiological
  responses.
     12.12.5.1. WBGT Index Stages and Flags. Activity levels to prevent heat stress injuries
     can be tied to five stages of generally accepted WBGT index ranges. See Table 12.2 for
     these stages.
  12.12.6. Preventing Heat Stress Disorders in Training Environments. Use of the activity
  level restrictions in Table 12.2 is recommended when planning or conducting outdoor
  training or movements. Personnel should be considered unacclimatized unless exposed to
  increasing levels of exertion in WBGT heat conditions.
  12.12.7. Preventing Heat Stress Disorders in Occupational (Nontraining) Environments. Use
  of the activity level restrictions in Table 12.3 is recommended when planning work and rest
  cycles for personnel who routinely perform their jobs while exposed to hot environments.
  The WBGT values listed in the table are screening values for the particular work rate
  indicated. These values are extracted from the American Conference of Governmental
  Industrial Hygienists threshold limit values handbook. NOTE: The heat category and flag
  color from Table 12.2 do not apply to occupationally exposed workers.

NOTES:
        1. These values will sustain performance and hydration for at least 4 hours of work in
           the specified heat category. (Values are based on US Army Research Institute for
           Environmental Medicine recommendations; US Army policy.)
        2. Wearing body armor adds 5 o F to measured WBGT.
        3. When performing activities with ground crew ensemble, fire-fighting gear, or other
           restrictive or impermeable clothing, make arrangements for remote site measurement
           of the WBGT and add 10 degrees F to the measurement (add 15 degrees F if also
           wearing body armor). These adjustments account for the clothing and equipment
           effects on evaporative cooling (increased barrier) and any increase in work due to the
           additional load.
        4. Rest means minimal physical activity (sitting or standing) accomplished in the shade
           if possible (but not necessary).
        5. Individual water need will vary +/- 1/4 quart per hour.

CAUTION: Hourly fluid intake should not exceed 1 1/2 quarts; daily fluid intake should not
exceed 12 quarts. Rapid ingestion of large amounts of water (greater than 1 1/2 quarts per hour)
may lead to hyponatremia (acute water intoxication), which is a life-threatening condition that
may lead to weakness, convulsions, loss of consciousness, and death if not recognized and
treated promptly.

NOTE: Values given in °F WBGT.
12.13. Hot Weather Solutions:
       12.13.1. Fluid Replenishment and Salt. People often don’t replenish the 2-3 gallons of liquid
       they sweat daily and ―thirst‖ is not an adequate indication to signal fluid intake. Therefore,
       supervisors must implement and enforce policies to ensure personnel drink the recommended
       amount of fluid, even if they are not thirsty. The amount of fluid replacement depends upon
       the activity, temperature, and how much sweat is generated. Medical personnel can advise
       how much replacement liquid is required, as well as what type of liquids are recommended
       (normally, non-carbonated beverages and water). Personnel should avoid alcoholic and
       beverages with caffeine; they affect the body’s circulatory function and may increase
       urination and the tendency for dehydration. Drinking highly sweetened beverages is also not
       recommended. Liquids should be sipped, not gulped and it is better to drink small amounts of
       water frequently than to drink large amounts occasionally. Some salt is lost in the sweat.
       Because the typical North American diet contains so much salt, an individual should season
       food to taste but should not make any additional attempts to add excessive salt to the diet.
       Salt tablets shall not be used except under special operating environments when ordered by
       competent medical authority. In addition, supervisors must ensure individuals with medical
       conditions requiring a low-sodium diet are provided with appropriate liquids.
100                                                           AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


  12.13.2. Adequate Food Intake. Failure to consume sufficient food energy can increase the
  risk of dehydration and heat injury and illness. Causes of inadequate food intake are:
  decreased appetite, poor ration palatability, menu boredom, inability to work on a full
  stomach, lack of water, lack of specific meal periods, lack of time to prepare meals, anxiety
  due to field conditions, and intentional dieting. In hot weather, the amount of calories
  required actually increases slightly although the desire to eat goes down. Appetite
  suppression is a more serious problem in individuals who are not heat acclimatized.
      12.13.2.1. Personnel living and working in temperatures ranging from 86 to 104 degrees
      °F may require up to 10 percent more calories to do the same amount of work as they
      would under more temperate conditions. Inadequate food intake results in body weight
      loss, which can eventually impair physical and mental performance. Poor food intake
      decreases the intake of salt necessary to retain water.
      12.13.2.2. Individuals consume almost half of all fluids at mealtimes. When personnel
      skip meals or voluntarily limit their food intake, then the amount of fluids consumed may
      also decrease.
      12.13.2.3. Encourage personnel to eat at least two balanced meals per day.
  12.13.3. Clothing. Whenever possible, personnel should wear the appropriate weight
  uniform and a hat. If possible, wear loose fitting clothing, especially at the neck and wrist, to
  allow air circulation. Senior leadership may want to consider alternative uniform policies,
  such as allowing workers to unblouse trouser cuffs on the battle dress uniform and authorize
  wear of ―floppy‖ type or soft brimmed head gear to minimize the effects of hot weather
  environments.
      12.13.3.1. Guidelines For Wear Of The Chemical Defense Ensemble. Personnel
      performing ground crew operations and training while wearing the charcoal impregnated
      overgarment and associated protective equipment of the chemical defense ensemble are
      at increased risk of injury from heat stress. Maximum work times tolerated by personnel
      while they are wearing the protective ensemble are affected by factors such as an
      individual's physical condition, state of thermal acclimatization, and degree of hydration;
      the workload associated with a given task; and environmental factors including air
      velocity, radiant heat (for example, sunlight), air temperature, and humidity. WBGT
      criteria incorporate many of these variables. While WBGT criteria aid in advising
      commanders concerning the impact of the ensemble under actual operating conditions,
      they are not readily usable by line supervisors when conducting small unit training
      exercises.
      12.13.3.2. Minimization of Heat Casualties. Measures to minimize heat casualties in
      personnel while they are accomplishing their mission are discussed in AFMAN 32-4005,
      Personnel Protection and Attack Actions. Estimates of increases in task performance
      times, "maximum" and "safe" work times, and recovery rest times, while personnel are
      wearing mission-oriented protective postures (MOPP) 4 equipment, are in AFMAN 32-
      4005. Commanders and supervisors should consult this guidance when planning and
      conducting operations to avoid heat injuries in their personnel.
  12.13.4. Cool Rest Areas. In very hot situations, cool rest areas should be provided for
  personnel.
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                  101


  12.13.5. Rest Breaks. Integrate rest breaks in to the work schedule. Work-rest cycles provide
  the opportunity for a body to dissipate excess heat, slow down the production of internal
  heat, and provide greater blood flow to the skin. Short, but frequent rest breaks are
  recommended in hot environments. Use intermittent rest periods with water breaks. Ideally,
  the workload should be distributed evenly over the course of the day.
  12.13.6. The ―Buddy System.‖ Use of the ―buddy system‖ to help detect signs of
  dehydration and illness in others is highly encouraged.
  12.13.7. Other Administrative Controls:
     12.13.7.1. Reduce the physical demands of work when possible (use mechanical
     assistance for excessive or heavy lifting or digging);
     12.13.7.2. Whenever possible, use shifts, such as early morning, cool part of the day, or
     night work;
     12.13.7.3. Use relief workers and pace the work; and
     12.13.7.4. Limit worker occupancy, or the number of workers present, especially in
     enclosed areas.

                                           Chapter 13

                                   NATURAL DISASTERS

13.1. Introduction. Each year natural disasters affect the lives of thousands of people. Within
minutes, a natural disaster can devastate an entire area, and change people’s lives forever. People
who understand disasters and know what to do beforehand and after a disaster hits can
significantly reduce disaster deaths and damage. Preparedness is crucial. Each unit should pre-
plan for a disaster. During the first few hours or in some cases, the days following a disaster,
essential services may be limited or unavailable. People must be prepared and ready to react to a
number of severe natural disaster scenarios.
13.2. Flash Floods:
   13.2.1. Flash flood waves, moving at incredible speed, can roll boulders, tear out trees,
   destroy buildings and bridges, and scour out new channels. It is possible for deadly walls of
   water to suddenly become destructive floods and rush through an area without warning.
   13.2.2. When a flash flood warning is issued for an area or it’s suspected that a flash flood is
   imminent, act quickly. Every second counts!
       13.2.2.1. Go to high ground immediately.
       13.2.2.2. Avoid areas subject to flooding such as, dips, low spots, canyons, gullies,
       culverts, and washes.
       13.2.2.3. Do not attempt to cross a swollen stream on foot. Do not attempt to drive
       through flooded areas. Shallow, swiftly flowing water can wash a vehicle from a
       roadway. Also, the roadbed under the water may not be intact.
       13.2.2.4. If a vehicle stalls in a stream or flooded area abandon it immediately and seek
       higher ground—rapidly rising water may engulf the vehicle and sweep it away.
13.3. Sand and Dust Storms:
   13.3.1. A sand or dust storm usually arrives suddenly in the form of an advancing wall of
   sand or dust and debris which may be miles long and several thousand feet high. These
   storms can strike with little warning, making driving conditions hazardous. Blinding, choking
   sand or dust can quickly reduce visibility, causing traffic mishaps that may involve chain
   collisions, creating massive pileups. Dust storms usually last only a few minutes, but the
   actions a motorist takes during the storm are important.
   13.3.2. Sand and dust storm safety tips follow:
       13.3.2.1. If dense sand or dust is observed blowing across or approaching a roadway,
       pull the vehicle off the pavement as far as possible, stop, turn off lights, set the
       emergency brake, and take your foot off the brake pedal to be sure the tail lights are not
       illuminated. NOTE: In the past, motorists driving in sand and dust storms have pulled off
       the roadway, leaving lights on. Vehicles approaching from the rear and using the advance
       car’s lights as a guide have inadvertently left the roadway and in some instances collided
       with the parked vehicle. Make sure all lights are off when departed from the roadway.
       13.3.2.2. Don’t enter the dust or sand storm area unless it’s absolutely unavoidable.
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                       103


       13.3.2.3. If leaving the roadway is not possible, proceed at a speed suitable for visibility,
       turn on the vehicle lights, and occasionally sound the horn. If visible, use the painted
       centerline as a guide. Look for a safe place to pull off the roadway.
       13.3.2.4. Never stop on the traveled portion of the roadway.
       13.3.2.5. A dust or sand storm warning means visibility of 1/2 mile or less due to
       blowing dust or sand, and wind speeds of 30 miles an hour or more.
13.4. Tornados:
   13.4.1. A tornado watch means conditions for tornado development a favorable. A tornado
   warning means a tornado has been sighted on the ground.
   13.4.2. If a tornado warning is issued for an area or whenever a tornado threatens:
       13.4.2.1. Stay away from windows, doors, and outside walls. Don’t open the windows.
       13.4.2.2. Go to a basement or shelter if available or to an interior room on the lowest
       floor, such as a closet or bathroom. Crouch down and cover your head.
       13.4.2.3. Exit vehicles immediately and go to a substantial structure or designated
       tornado shelter. If no suitable structure is nearby, lie flat in the nearest ditch, ravine,
       culvert, or other depression and use your hands to cover your head.
       13.4.2.4. Leave as soon as tornado danger has passed to avoid swollen stream waters that
       often accompany thunderstorms.
       13.4.2.5. Remember—if you see a tornado and it looks like it is not moving, it might be
       heading straight at you.
13.5. Hurricanes. A hurricane causes sea level to rise above normal tidal heights, with giant
wind-driven waves and strong, unpredictable currents. Tornadoes spawned by hurricanes are
extremely dangerous.
   13.5.1. Hurricane Watch—Hurricane conditions pose a possible threat to an area, usually
   within 36 hours. In some especially vulnerable areas, early evacuation may be necessary
   when a Watch is issued.
   13.5.2. Hurricane Warning–Hurricane conditions are expected in an area within 24 hours.
   Areas subject to storm surge or tides should be evacuated as well as areas which could be
   isolated by flood waters.
   13.5.3. When your area receives a hurricane warning:
       13.5.3.1. Leave low-lying areas.
       13.5.3.2. Protect windows with boards, shutters, or tape.
       13.5.3.3. Secure outdoor objects or bring them inside.
       13.5.3.4. Ensure vehicles are fully fueled.
       13.5.3.5. Save several days’ water supply.
       13.5.3.6. Stock up on canned and other nonperishable food items.
 104                                                          AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


       13.5.3.7. Check radio and flashlight for good batteries. (Keep an additional supply of
       batteries on-hand.)
       13.5.3.8. Adjust refrigerator controls to maximum cold settings and don’t open unless
       necessary.
       13.5.3.9. Use the phone only for emergencies.
       13.5.3.10. Stay inside on the downwind side if the building is sturdy and on high ground,
       or in the center of the building, in a closet, or bathroom without windows. In all cases,
       stay away from windows.
   13.5.4. If it becomes necessary to leave, shut off water and electricity at main connections.
   13.5.5. Be alert for tornadoes, which can happen before, during, and after a hurricane passes
   over.
   13.5.6. Stay away from floodwaters.
   13.5.7. Be aware of the calm ―eye;‖ the storm is not over. The worst part of the storm will
   follow once the eye passes over and the winds come from the opposite direction. Trees,
   shrubs, buildings, and other objects damaged by the first winds can be broken or destroyed
   by the second winds whose force is opposite the first winds.
13.6. Tsunami Safety:
   13.6.1. The phenomenon called ―tsunami‖ (soo-NAH-mee) is a series of traveling ocean
   waves of extremely long length generated by disturbances associated primarily with
   earthquakes occurring below or near the ocean floor. Underwater volcanic eruptions and
   landslides can also generate tsunamis.
       13.6.1.1. Tsunamis that strike a coastal location in the Pacific Ocean Basin are most
       always caused by earthquakes.
       13.6.1.2. Tsunamis can be very large. In coastal areas their height can be as great as 30
       feet or more (100 feet in extreme cases), and they can move inland several hundred feet.
       13.6.1.3. All low lying coastal areas can be struck by tsunamis.
       13.6.1.4. A tsunami consists of a series of waves. Often the first wave may not be the
       largest. The danger from a tsunami can last for several hours after the arrival of the first
       wave.
       13.6.1.5. Tsunamis can move faster than a person can run and can crush homes and other
       coastal structures.
       13.6.1.6. A tsunami will cause the water near shore to recede, exposing the ocean floor.
       13.6.1.7. The force of some tsunamis is enormous. Large rocks weighing several tons,
       along with boats and other debris, can be moved inland hundreds of feet by the tsunami
       wave activity.
       13.6.1.8. Tsunamis can occur at any time, day or night.
       13.6.1.9. Tsunamis can travel up rivers and streams that lead to the ocean.
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                       105


      13.6.1.10. Offshore reefs and shallow areas may help break the force of tsunami waves,
      but large and dangerous waves can still be a threat to coastal residents in these areas.
   13.6.2. What to do during a tsunami:
      13.6.2.1. If in a tsunami evacuation zone, evacuate to the evacuation site.
      13.6.2.2. If at the beach or near the ocean and the earth shakes, move immediately to
      higher ground. DO NOT wait for a tsunami warning to be announced. (A regional
      tsunami from a local earthquake could strike some areas before a tsunami warning could
      be announced.) Stay away from rivers and streams that lead to the ocean.
      13.6.2.3. Tsunamis generated in distant locations will generally give people enough time
      to move to higher ground. Small buildings located in low-lying coastal areas are not
      designed to withstand tsunami impacts. Do not stay in these structures if a tsunami
      warning is issued.
13.7. Earthquakes:
   13.7.1. An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the Earth caused by the breaking and
   shifting of rock beneath the Earth’s surface.
      13.7.1.1. This shaking can cause buildings and bridges to collapse; disrupt gas, electric,
      and phone service; and sometimes trigger landslides, avalanches, flash floods, fires, and
      huge, destructive ocean waves (tsunamis).
      13.7.1.2. Buildings with foundations resting on unconsolidated landfill, old waterways,
      or other unstable soil are most at risk. Buildings or trailers and manufactured buildings
      not tied to a reinforced foundation anchored to the ground are also at risk since they can
      be shaken off their mountings during an earthquake.
      13.7.1.3. Earthquakes can occur at any time of the year.
      13.7.1.4. The actual movement of the ground in an earthquake is seldom the direct cause
      of death or injury. Most casualties result from falling objects and debris because the
      shocks can shake, damage, or demolish buildings and other structures. Earthquakes may
      also trigger landslides and generate huge ocean waves (seismic sea waves), each of which
      can cause widespread injury, death, and destruction.
   13.7.2. What to do when the shaking begins:
      13.7.2.1. DROP, COVER, AND HOLD ON! Move only a few steps to a nearby safe
      place. Stay indoors until the shaking stops. Evacuate buildings and structures only after
      the shaking has stopped.
      13.7.2.2. If inside a building, get under a sturdy piece of furniture like a desk or table and
      hold on to it. If the desk or table moves across the floor you will move with it and not be
      left unprotected. If there is nothing to get under, then get against an inside hallway or
      stand in a doorway.
      13.7.2.3. Stay clear of windows and heavy furniture or appliances. Avoid areas where
      things may fall on you (storage areas, warehouses, etc.)
      13.7.2.4. Do not run down stairs or rush outside while the building is shaking or while
      there is danger of falling and getting injured or being hit by falling glass or debris.

      13.7.2.5. If outdoors, find a clear spot away from buildings, trees, power lines, or
      anything else that may fall. Drop to the ground.
      13.7.2.6. If in a vehicle, drive away from bridges, underpasses, or overpasses. Carefully
      bring the vehicle to a stop in a safe area and set the parking brake. Stay in the vehicle
      until the shaking stops. If a power line falls on the vehicle, stay inside until a trained
      person removes the wire. When driving is resumed, watch for breaks in the pavement,
      fallen rocks, and uneven and damaged traffic structures, such as bridges and underpasses.
      13.7.2.7. Expect aftershocks. Each time one is felt, DROP, COVER, AND HOLD ON!

                                          PERSONNEL

14.1. Fatigue. Fatigue can cause mishaps. After 48 to 72 hours without sleep, personnel
become ineffective. So, the best measure against fatigue is sleep. Water consumption, diet,
physical conditioning, and personal hygiene all have an impact on fatigue. Ensure the impact is
positive.
   14.1.1. Symptoms of Fatigue. The symptoms manifest themselves in increased errors,
   difficulty in following instructions, lack of motivation, and carelessness. All this may
   translate into unnecessary risk-taking or shortcuts to get the job done—an open invitation for
   a mishap. Watch for the following symptoms of fatigue:
       14.1.1.1. Headaches.
       14.1.1.2. Poor physical hygiene.
       14.1.1.3. Impatience and irritability.
       14.1.1.4. Loss of appetite.
       14.1.1.5. Inability to focus on task at hand.
       14.1.1.6. Outright physical exhaustion.
       14.1.1.7. Inability to make decisions.
   14.1.2. Facts About Sleep Deprivation:
       14.1.2.1. You cannot train to overcome sleep loss.
       14.1.2.2. Tasks—even critical tasks—that are uninteresting and take a long time are
       extremely conducive to sleep.
       14.1.2.3. Performance of mental tasks requiring calculations, creativity, and ability to
       plan ahead declines by 25 percent for every 24-hour period of semi-continuous work
       without sleep.
       14.1.2.4. Leader ’s abilities can be degraded by sleep loss, impacting on quick and
       effective responses to changing battlefield conditions.
       14.1.2.5. Tasks that have been well-learned and repeatedly practiced are more resistant
       to sleep-loss effects. Therefore, select the best trained to perform critical tasks.
       14.1.2.6. The ability to learn new information is compromised by sleep loss.
       14.1.2.7. Leadership ability cannot overcome sleep loss.
       14.1.2.8. Sleep loss over time (greater than 2 days) has a cumulative effect.
   14.1.3. Guidelines for Sleep Plans:
       14.1.3.1. Six to eight hours’ sleep will maintain mental task performance indefinitely.
       14.1.3.2. Three to four hours’ sleep daily will maintain mental task performance for 5 to
       6 days.
 108                                                          AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


       14.1.3.3. Less than 4 hours’ sleep daily over a 3- to 6-day period will impair
       effectiveness.
       14.1.3.4. Best sleep periods, given limited choice, are 0300 to 0600 and 1600 to 1900.
       14.1.3.5. Provide for a minimum of 4 to 5 hours’ quality (uninterrupted) sleep; however,
       after 6 to 7 days, accumulated sleep loss will equate to performance of 48 hours without
       sleep.
       14.1.3.6. Allow for naps as often as possible. Four 1-hour naps in a 24-hour period are as
       beneficial as 4 hours’ sleep. However, accumulative sleep loss is more severe with
       fragmented sleep.
       14.1.3.7. Sleep plans should include provisions to recover from sleep loss:
          14.1.3.7.1. Twelve hours of sleep or rest (at least 8 to 10 hours’ sleep) are required
          after 36 to 48 hours’ acute sleep loss.
          14.1.3.7.2. Twenty-four hours of sleep or rest (at least 15 hours’ sleep) are required
          after 36 to 48 hours’ sleep loss under conditions of high workload (12 to 16 hours per
          day). This is particularly important for commanders and staff with high mental task
          workloads.
          14.1.3.7.3. Two to three days of sleep or rest are required after 72 to 96 hours’ sleep
          loss. The sleep or rest period means 8 to 10 hours of sleep per day and light duty.
14.2. Personnel Checklist:
   14.2.1. Are people actively involved in the buddy system on- and off-duty, on- and off-base?
   14.2.2. Are people briefed to continuously scan to identify potential unsafe acts and
   conditions in order to prevent mishaps?
   14.2.3. Do supervisors give periodic safety briefings?
   14.2.4. Do people use team work for hazard identification and elimination?
   14.2.5. Do people know how to use fire extinguishers?
   14.2.6. Are people aware of carbon monoxide poisoning symptoms: headache, dizziness,
   nausea, vomiting, fainting, chest pain, rapid breathing, shortness of breath, confusion, reddish

   to death?
   14.2.7. Are people aware of first aid for carbon monoxide poisoning: removal from exposure
   area to fresh air, loosen clothing, give CPR if not breathing, keep warm?
   14.2.8. Are people billeted off-base in foreign countries aware that non-US construction and
   safety standards are often considerably less stringent than those in the US?
       14.2.8.1. For example, it is not an uncommon practice, for hotels in third-world
       countries, to chain or lock doors leading outside that are intended for emergency egress in
       the event of fire or other unsafe condition. This can be a deadly practice!
   14.2.9. Are people aware off-base establishments may be heated with kerosene or charcoal
   in an under-the-floor heating system? (Ventilate rooms to reduce possibility of carbon
   monoxide poisoning.)

  producing devices in the presence of flammable materials?
  14.2.18. Are roof-top parties strictly forbidden?
  14.2.19. Are people aware of the hazards of drinking and the potential of falling from
  balconies and out of windows?
  14.2.20. Do people avoid sleeping in areas where vehicles might be moving off road?
  14.2.21. Do people wear personal protective equipment when required or when it reduces
  the chance of injury?

                                      SPOT INSPECTIONS

15.1. General. In this guide there are a number of applicable areas for conducting spot
inspections. The Deployment Safety Officer and NCO should conduct spot inspections of
operational and industrial activities and facilities on a daily basis. The inspection should be
logged and maintained in a continuity book, and in the event that a problem is identified, follow-
up inspections should be conducted and documented. Proper documentation may alleviate
problems later.
15.2. Safety Inspections. Safety inspections serve to identify hazards and correct them before a
mishap occurs. Detailed inspections are carefully planned, and when a hazard is identified and a
corrective action is taken, the inspection serves its purpose. Inspection reports should identify the
root causes of an observed hazard, not merely the symptoms, to enable corrective action to be
applied to a more general area than just the place where the hazard was identified. Spot
inspections serve the same purpose, but are more spontaneous, less structured, and serve to
examine subject areas at random points in time. This tends to make spot inspections a good
barometer of the unit’s safety climate.
15.3. Pre-Inspection Requirements. Maintaining a close working relationship with unit
personnel is essential for conducting an effective safety program, and all functional areas of
safety must be involved. Conducting spot inspections provides an excellent opportunity for
getting involved in unit activities. Before embarking on an inspection:
   15.3.1. Review material applicable to the area to be inspected. Use applicable checklists, if
   available, during the inspection. Spot inspection checklists do not include every item that
   may be observed and are not necessarily referred to in a step-by-step fashion.
   15.3.2. When arriving in the area, contact the area supervisor before starting the spot
   inspection.
   15.3.3. Explain that it is a spot inspection, and if requested, provide any checklists used for
   the inspection.
15.4. Documentation. Use a log to document spot inspections, even if no hazards are
discovered. Maintain this documentation in a continuity book to facilitate program management
should a safety staff follow
15.5. Re-Inspections. Be sure to re-inspect the areas where hazards are found to ensure
corrective actions are taken and remain effective.
15.6. Responsibilities. In general, all Air Force employees must:
   15.6.1. Comply with all US Air Force, Occupational Safety and Health Administration
   (OSHA), and AFOSH standards.
   15.6.2. Promptly report safety, fire, and health hazards to their supervisor and to a safety
   representative as soon as possible.
   15.6.3. Promptly report occupational injuries and illnesses to supervisors.
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                           111


  15.6.4. Wear or use required protective clothing and equipment.
  15.6.5. Take adequate care while doing assigned tasks.

                                 AFTER-ACTION REPORT

16.1. After-action reports should be completed after any deployment or contingency operation.
Information in after-action reports can be used during other operations and can be shared with
representatives of other organizations who will be involved in a similar operation or an operation
that takes place in the same locality.
16.2. Suggest an after-action report contain, as a minimum, the following items. Each
organization can include additional material, as required.
   16.2.1. Synopsis of deficiencies noted during inspections (categorize)?
   16.2.2. What didn’t work?
   16.2.3. Successes (what worked)?
   16.2.4. Priority items (what to do right away)?

Terms
Bare Base—A base having minimum essential facilities to house, sustain, and support
operations to include, if required, a stabilized runway, taxiways, and aircraft parking areas. A
bare base must have a source of water that can be made potable.
Beddown—Common terminology used for the destination of combat forces in a theater
(equivalent to a destination).
AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001                                                                       117


Camouflage, Concealment, and Deception—The use of concealment, disguise and decoys to
minimize the possibility of detection or identification of troops, material, equipment and
installations. It includes taking advantage of the natural environment as well as the application of
natural and artificial materials.
Chemical Defense—The methods, plans and procedures involved in establishing and executing
defensive measures against attack utilizing chemical agents.
Chemical Warfare—All aspects of military operations involving the employment of lethal and
incapacitating munitions/agents and the warning and protective measures associated with such
offensive operations. Since riot control agents and herbicides are not considered to be chemical
warfare agents, those two items will be referred to separately or under the broader term
"chemical", which will be used to include all types of chemical munitions/agents collectively.
The term "chemical warfare weapons" may be used when it is desired to reflect both lethal and
incapacitating munitions/agents of either chemical or biological origin.
Contingency—An emergency involving military forces caused by natural disasters, terrorists,
subversives, or by required military operations. Due to the uncertainty of the situation,
contingencies required plans, rapid response, and special procedures to ensure the safety and
readiness of personnel, installations, and equipment. See also contingency contracting. (JP 1-
02)
Contingency Operations—A military operation that is either designated by the Secretary of
Defense as a contingency operation or becomes a contingency operation as a matter of law (10
United States code (USC) 101[a] [131]). It is a military operation that: a. is designated by the
Secretary of Defense as an operation in which members of the Armed Forces are or may become
involved in military actions, operations, or hostilities against an enemy of the United States or
against an opposing forces; or b. is created by definition of law. Under 10 USC 101 (a)(13)(B), a
contingency operation exists if a military operation results in the (1) callup to (or retention on)
active duty of members of the uniformed Services under certain enumerated statues (10 USC
Section 688, 12301(a), 12302, 12304, 12305, 12406, or 331-335); and (2) the callup to (or
retention on) active duty of members of the uniformed Services under other (non-enumerated)
statutes during war or national emergency declared by the President or Congress. See also
contingency; operation. (JP 1-02)
Deployment—The relocation of forces to designated areas of operations.
Deployment Planning—Operational planning directed toward the movement of forces and
sustainment resources from their original locations to a specific operational area for conducting
the joint operations contemplated in a given plan. Encompasses all activities from origin or home
station through destination, specifically including and intratheater movement legs, staging areas,
and holding areas. See also deployment; deployment order; deployment preparation order.
(JP 1-02)
Exercise—A military maneuver or simulated wartime operation involving planning, preparation,
and execution. It is carried out for the purpose of training and evaluation. It may be a combined,
joint, or single-Service exercise, depending on participating organizations.
Force Beddown—The provision of expedient facilities for troop support to provide a platform
for the projection of force. These facilities may include modular or kit-type substitutes.
 118                                                           AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


Foreign Object Damage (FOD)—Rags, pieces of paper, line, articles of clothing, nuts, bolts,
fasteners, or tools that, when misplaced or caught by air currents normally found around aircraft
operations (jet blast, rotor or prop wash, engine intake), cause damage to aircraft systems or
weapons or injury to personnel.
Harvest Eagle—A nickname for an air transportable package of housekeeping equipment, spare
parts, and supplies required for support of US Air Force general-purpose forces and personnel in
bare base conditions. Examples of Harvest Eagle equipment are water purification units, tents,
and showers. Each kit is designed to provide softwall housekeeping support for 1100 personnel.
Harvest Falcon—Harvest Falcon is a nickname given to a selected package of mobile facility,
utility and equipment assets required to support forces and aircraft under bare base conditions.
These WRM assets are packaged in air transportable sets to include housekeeping, industrial,
initial flightline and follow-on flightline. Harvest Falcon sets are designed to support increments
of 1,100 personnel and squadron size aircraft deployments.
Hazard—A condition with the potential to cause injury, illness, or death of personnel; damage
to or loss of equipment or property; or mission degradation. See also injury; risk. (JP 1-02)
Hazardous Cargo—Explosives and other hazardous articles such as flammable liquids and
solids, oxidizing materials, corrosive materials, compressed gases, poisons, irritating materials,
etiologic agents, radioactive material, and other unregulated cargo.
Hazardous Materials—A substance or material that is capable of posing an unreasonable risk to
health, safety, and property when transported and has been so designated by AFJMAN 24-204,
Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments. May also be referred to as hazardous
cargo or dangerous goods.
Heat-Related Illnesses—Heat-related illnesses such as fainting from heat, heat exhaustion, and
heat stroke are far more serious than a sunburn. These conditions occur when workers become
very overheated and dehydrated, and in many cases, they are accompanied by sunburn. The
following may be symptoms of heat-related illnesses: nausea, vomiting, fainting, high fever,
delirium, or diarrhea, and medical care may be needed.
Host Unit—The organization designated by the host MAJCOM or HQ USAF to furnish support
to a tenant unit. The host unit develops, publishes, and maintains the base mobility guidance to
support the deployment of Air Force units from a particular base.

                                   SAFETY BRIEFINGS

A2.1. Deployment Briefing Operational Risk Management Considerations:
   A2.1.1. Operational Risk Management applies to everyone—on and off duty. Identifying
   risks is everyone’s job.
   A2.1.2. General items to consider: Are individuals familiar with the deployment area? If not,
   safety concerns must be covered in greater detail. General concerns might include:
      A2.1.2.1. Time differences. When traveling across time zones, people will often
      experience some degree of fatigue and disorientation. ―Jet lag‖ can be minimized by
      doing the following:
          A2.1.2.1.1. When flying commercial air as a passenger avoid alcohol during the
          flight.
          A2.1.2.1.2. If time permits, adjust to the new time zone prior to departure? If not,
          attempt to adjust eating and sleeping habits incrementally during flight.
          A2.1.2.1.3. Upon arrival, adjust to the new time and work schedule as quickly as
          possible.
      A2.1.2.2. Weather. Check on the weather at destination. Aside from bringing appropriate
      clothing, find out if there are any unusual conditions that may require additional
      preparation (for example, suntan lotion, insect repellent, etc.). NOTE: Commanders—is
      unit-issued clothing (parkas, desert BDUs…) ready to go in sufficient quantities?
      A2.1.2.3. Driving. Driving has the greatest potential for on and off duty mishaps. What
      side of the road do vehicles drive on? What are the road conditions? Are speed limits
      mph or kph? Do pedestrians have the right of way? Will operators need additional
      training and license?
      A2.1.2.4. Food. Address basic questions. Is off-base food and drink safe for
      consumption? Can fruits, vegetables, and meats purchased off base be eaten? Are there
      any items, such as certain alcohol or over-the-counter drugs that contain controlled
      substances?
      A2.1.2.5. Local Customs and Hazardous Situations or Conditions. Incorporate
      intelligence information into a pre-departure brief. Check with local Office of Special
      Investigations personnel for this information. Consider factors such as, are local people
      generally friendly to Americans in general and military personnel in particular? Are there
      any taboo actions likely to cause friction with local inhabitants? Are there any
      revolutionary or terrorist groups? Is there a curfew and what areas are off limits? Chances
      are, most people will not be familiar with the contingency location. Is the area a location
      where it is not a good idea to go off sightseeing or ―out on the town‖ alone. Also, in
      many locations respect for authority is considered important. If approached by a
      policeman, cooperate fully.
 122                                                              AFPAM91-216 9 AUGUST 2001


A2.2. Pre-Departure :

NOTE: While it is impossible to list all the items needed or actions necessary to adequately
prepare for all deployed operations, the information provided here should be helpful. Keep in
mind that winter conditions may necessitate additional gear, such as a parka, boots, scarf, gloves,
etc. The same is true for desert climates. In the latter goggles, and a scarf for face and neck
protection against blowing sand might be required. As previously stated local readiness
agencies should be the first point of contact for answering deployment concerns.

       SAMPLE DEPLOYMENT OPERATIONAL RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX

To determine the amount of risk involved during deployment operations, circle the number
corresponding to the known hazards listed on the charts. Then total all the numbers to get a final
idea of how risky the deployment will be. Check the risk gauge at the end to determine how
much risk is involved. Take action to eliminate or reduce risks whenever possible.
