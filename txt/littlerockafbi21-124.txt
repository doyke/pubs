This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance and applies to the 19th
Airlift Wing. This establishes policy, assigns responsibility, and outlines procedures for
preparing aircraft assigned to the 19th Airlift Wing for functional and acceptance check flights at
Little Rock Air Force Base. The 19th Operations Group (OG) Commander, Standardization
Evaluation officer in charge for functional check flights (FCFs), quality assurance functional
check flight personnel, and maintenance supervisors at all levels will ensure compliance with this
instruction. The use of name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial product,
commodity, or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force. Ensure
that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW

1. Functional Check Flight (FCF).
     1.1. Functional Check Flights (FCF) to include, Operational Check Flights (OCF), and High
     Speed Taxi Checks (HSTC) are performed to ensure aircraft are safe for flight and capable of
     performing assigned missions. However, CFs are not flown when the airworthiness of the
     aircraft can be determined by maintenance operational checks prescribed by a technical
     directive.
     1.2. HSTCs may be utilized instead of CFs with 19th MXG/CC and 19th OG/CC
     authorization, IAW AFI 21-101.
     1.3. QA, maintenance supervision, and the applicable flying squadron operations’ desk will
     schedule the first and subsequent CF and HSTC attempts in conjunction with each other.
     Applicable squadron’s operations supervisors will be notified of the requirement for a CF
     aircrew no later than 1100L the day prior to flight.
2. Maintenance Responsibilities. The owning maintenance unit will ensure the following steps
are completed:
     2.1. Ensure all aircraft systems are fully operational or will not affect the CF profile.
     2.2. Coordinate fuel load and cargo compartment configuration requirements then
     refuel/configure the aircraft according to aircrew request. To minimize brake and tire wear
     while performing HSTC, coordinate with the FCF aircrew to ensure the aircraft is configured
     with the minimum fuel practical, but not less than Dash-1 operational fuel minimums.
     2.3. Prepare the aircraft AFTO Form 781 Series forms binder for review by QA. Ensure all
     AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document; to include the original
     grounding discrepancies are included for the review.
     2.4. Transcribe the aircraft forms prior to flight. Bring the transcribed forms to QA no later
     than 1100 one day prior to CF or HSTC. The active set of forms will be delivered no later
     than 0700 on the day of CF or HSTC for the aircrew briefing. Transcribed forms will include
     all forms back to the last flight. The active set and transcribed forms will be available at QA
     for aircrew briefing.
     2.5. Ensure closed discrepancies are cleared out of G081 and verify with the 19th
     Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) that the aircraft status is correct IAW AFI 21-103,
     Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting.
3. Quality Assurance Responsibilities. Upon notification of a CF or HSTC requirement, the
following steps will be taken:
     3.1. Review the aircraft forms for maintenance accuracy and completed documentation.
     Prepare a concise statement of the reason for the CF or HSTC to be included in the
     discrepancy block of the blue lined AFTO 781A, stamped FCF worksheet.
     3.2. A blue lined 781A and a verbal briefing are required for HSTC and OCF. QA will
     develop an aircrew briefing checklist specifically for HSTCs IAW AFI 11-201.
     3.3. On the day of the CF or HSTC, review the active set of aircraft forms and verify status
     by calling MOC. Coordinate with the owning maintenance unit to load a job control number
     in G081. All CFs will use the following job control numbers. (JCNs): 8400-8424 as per Little
     Rock AFB 21-107, Job Control Number Assignment. Insert the blue lined 781A FCF
LITTLEROCKAFBI21-124 9 JULY 2013                                                                 3


   worksheet in front of the of the 781A note page of the active forms and have the highlighted
   checklist ready for the aircrew briefing.
   3.4. Notify the aircrew that the aircraft and forms are ready for briefing.
   3.5. When the aircrew arrives for the briefing, inform them of the reason for the CF or
   HSTC and annotate the briefing in the next open block on the AF Form 2400, Functional
   Check Flight Log. Ensure the aircrew is aware of any open discrepancies in the AFTO Form
   781A requiring aircrew attention (i.e., in-flight operational checks, in-flight negative torque
   checks, etc.).
4. Aircrew Responsibilities. The CF will be accomplished using the information contained in
the FCF Information Handbook containing TO 1-1-300 Acceptance/Functional Check Flight and
Maintenance Operational Checks, TO 1C-130H-6CF-1, 1C-130H-6CL-1 and 1C-130J-6CF-1 or
1C-130J-6CF-1 Acceptance and or Functional Check Flight Checklist.
   4.1. The aircraft commander will review the aircraft forms and applicable -6 CF or -6 CL to
   ensure they are aware of any changes and/or problems pertaining to the flight. The aircraft
   commander will sign the log sheet to signify he/she has reviewed the FCF Read File and will
   brief the aircrew on the contents that are applicable to their mission.
   4.2. An aircrew member will sign out TO 1C-MDS-6CF-1 from QA for guidance in
   accomplishing the FCF requirements, if one is not available at their duty section or aircraft is
   transient.
   4.3. Enter only FCF related discrepancies on the blue-lined 781A. Discrepancies not FCF
   related are placed in the regular 781As.
   4.4. The aircraft commander will annotate and complete the appropriate blocks on the
   completed -6 checklist, and the blue-lined 781A with the local time and date the FCF is
   completed. All dates and times should match each other.
5. FCF Completion. The following steps will be accomplished:
   5.1. Upon completion of the CF or HSTC, the QA technician will debrief the aircrew at the
   applicable maintenance debrief section, retrieve the applicable -6 CF checklist and TO1C-
   130H-6CF-1, if signed out from QA.
   5.2. When the FCF aircraft is released, QA will complete all documentation on the AF Form
   2400, Aircraft Functional Check Flight Log or the computer automated FCF Log as required.
   This will serve as a permanent record and will show deficiency or trend analysis.
   5.3. Deliver the FCF blue line 781A and completed checklist to the 19th MOS Plans,
   Scheduling, and Documentation section to be included in the aircraft jacket file as a
   permanent record.
6. Information Collections, Records, and Forms.
