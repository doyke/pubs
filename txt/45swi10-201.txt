3. Policies.
   3.1. The EET is managed by a primary duty staff and augmented with members from
   appropriate wing and tenant organizations. Once exercise planning has began, all
   participating team members will be operationally assigned to the EET Chief until released
   back to their respective duty section.
   3.2. A risk management approach to safety, fire prevention and occupational health hazards
   will be used in the planning and conduct of all exercises as outlined in AFI 91-202, US Air
   Force Mishap Prevention Program. The results of the risk management process will be
   documented and maintained by the EET Chief. Each assessment will identify all risks and
   will have a Risk Level assigned to each one based on the severity and probability.
   Collectively, an overall exercise risk assessment will be determined and based upon the Risk
   Level, the appropriate decision will be approved by the senior leader in control of the
   exercise.
   3.3. The EET develops scenarios designed to emphasize problem solving, responding to
   rapidly changing situations and operating with degraded capabilities in order to evaluate
   response and flexibility. Participating organizations request evaluation of unit-specific
   requirements through their EET member. The unit EET member will coordinate and
   integrate inputs with the full EET and adapt information to the overall scenario.
   3.4. Prior to exercise initiation, the EET Chief ensures trained and qualified members are
   available for each area or event to be evaluated. EET members are briefed on exercise
   objectives, scenario, expected activities, ground rules, simulations, safety and known limiting
   factors. Guidance as to debriefings, reports, badges and uniform requirements will be
   provided during planning meetings. In addition, exercise objectives and ground rules will be
   disseminated in advance of the initiation of the exercise.
   3.5. Performance during an exercise will be measured, recorded and analyzed from a no-
   fault perspective to identify systemic problems requiring corrective action.
   3.6. In addition to the exercise requirements listed in AFI 10-2501_AFSPCSUP_1, Chapter
   7, Table 7.1, and unit-identified requirements; the following types of exercises will be

     4.1.5. Tenant units will be coordinated with no later than one week prior to prepare for
     45 SW FPCON exercises which could result in the overtime of civilians. Authorization
     for the overtime will be determined by the tenant units. Tenant Commanders will have to
     determine if key civilians will participate and authorize overtime or compensatory time as
     necessary. Every effort will be made by the 45 SW/IG to minimize overtime costs.
     Generally, once the capability is demonstrated, the EET, Chief will authorize the release
     of effected civilian personnel.
  4.2. Proper safety practices will never be simulated. An exercise will be placed on
  temporary hold by any EET member or competent command authority whenever a condition
  exists which could result in injury, loss of life, property damage avoidable death/injury to
  wildlife or whenever response forces are required for an actual emergency.
  4.3. Emergency vehicles will obey all safety traffic rules when responding to exercise
  events. Vehicle-mounted sirens or horns will be used to announce withdrawal from the
  accident site during exercises, as appropriate.
  4.4. The Fire Protection Chief and Air Traffic Control Operations Chief must be notified
  30 minutes before any exercise involving their respective areas of responsibility to ensure the
  exercise will not conflict with actual operations.
  4.5. Exercise situations that would normally lead to the implementation of mutual aid
  agreements will be demonstrated by using a SIM SWITCH unless thoroughly pre-
  coordinated with all agencies involved.
  4.6. Each radio transmission and telephone call containing exercise information will begin
  and end by stating "EXERCISE, EXERCISE, EXERCISE."
  4.7. Exercise message traffic will not normally be transmitted off-base except between
  45 SW installations and downrange sites (for example, message traffic between PAFB and
  CCAFS, PAFB and Antigua AS, etc.). When message traffic is required to be transmitted
  off-base to a non-45 SW installation not involved in the exercise, the transmission will be
  simulated by completing the message process (without transmission) and providing the EET
  member a copy marked in bold print "EXERCISE MESSAGE”. There will however, be
  times when exercise messages may be required to be transmitted to higher headquarters and
  other agencies participating in either MAJCOM or Joint Exercises. Care will be taken to
  address only those agencies participating in the exercise when transmitting exercise
  messages.
  4.8. Use of Pyrotechnics:
     4.8.1. Safety precautions regarding the use of pyrotechnic device(s) which will result in
     sacrificing exercise realism (i.e., standoff distances), will be given consideration to
     simulating an explosive event by other visual and audible cues.
     4.8.2. An AF Form 2047, Explosives Facility License, listing the pyrotechnics that will
     be used during the exercise will be prepared for the vice wing commander’s signature.
     The license is a temporary license, it is time limited and valid only during a stated time
     frame. The requirements for the AF Form 2047 will be coordinated with Wing
10                                                               45SWI10-201 29 MARCH 2010


        Weapons/Explosives Safety.        The Wing Weapons/Explosives Safety section will
        complete the license.
        4.8.3. Smoke grenades, ground burst simulators, etc. will be in strict accordance with
        AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards. Only trained personnel can prepare and
        activate these devices. Training will be provided and certified by Explosive Ordnance
        Disposal (EOD) personnel. Use of pyrotechnics will have prior approval of 45 SW/SE
        (Ordnance Safety).
        4.8.4. The designated persons required to transport ordnance must be trained on
        ordnance transportation requirements.
        4.8.5. The proper paperwork, i.e., DD Form 626, Motor Vehicle Inspection
        (Transporting Hazardous Material), and DD Form 836, Dangerous Goods Shipping
        Paper/Declaration and Emergency Response Information for Hazardous Materials
        Transported by Government Vehicles, will be accomplished if items are transported off
        base. A military driver is required, unless a civilian driver is available with a commercial
        driver’s license with Hazardous Material endorsement.
        4.8.6. Once the ordnance is loaded on a vehicle it will not be left unattended. Refueling
        with ordnance loaded is prohibited.
        4.8.7. As a minimum, two - 2A:10BC fire extinguishers are required for transportation of
        ordnance. A fire extinguisher will be on hand when the pyrotechnics are being deployed.
        4.8.8. Pyrotechnics will not be deployed any closer than the following:
            4.8.8.1. Personnel or Vehicles – 125 feet.
            4.8.8.2. Facility with facing windows – 200 feet.

            4.8.8.6. Above ground magazines and earth covered magazines – 50 feet.
        4.8.9. Smoke grenades and Ground Burst Simulators (GBS) will not be used off base
        unless coordinated with the appropriate civil agencies through the 45 SW/PA office and
        the 45 SFS. As appropriate, 45 SW/PA will write and distribute a media advisory in
        advance of any on-base or off-base 45 SW exercise involving the use of smoke grenades
        or GBS outlining when and where the exercise will take place in an effort to pre-empt
        any undue panic or concern from the general public.
        4.8.10. In the event of an unexploded ordnance item, the ranking EET member will
        establish a cordon around the unexploded ordnance, taking great care that unauthorized
        personnel do not enter the cordon until the pyrotechnic item is made safe by EOD.
     4.9. Evacuations.
