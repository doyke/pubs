                                  LASER CLASSIFICATION

A2.1. Class 1 Laser System: Considered to be incapable of producing damaging radiation
levels during operation. It is exempt from any control measures or other forms of surveillance.
A2.2. Class 1M Laser System: Considered to be incapable of producing hazardous exposure
conditions during normal operation unless the beam is viewed with an optical instrument such as
an eye-loupe (diverging beam) or a telescope (collimated beam). It is exempt from any control
measures other than to prevent potentially hazardous optically aided viewing; and is exempt
from other forms of surveillance.
A2.3. Class 2 Laser System: Emits in the visible portion of the spectrum [0.4 to 0.7
micrometers (μm)], and eye protection is normally afforded by the aversion response.
A2.4. Class 2M Laser System: Emits in the visible portion of the spectrum (0.4 to 0.7 μm).
Eye protection is normally afforded by the aversion response for unaided viewing. However,
Class 2M is potentially hazardous if viewed with certain optical aids.
A2.5. Class 3 Laser System: May be hazardous under direct and specular reflection viewing
conditions, but is normally not a diffuse reflection or fire hazard. There are two subclasses.
A2.6. Class 3R Laser System: Potentially hazardous under some direct and specular reflection
viewing conditions if the eye is appropriately focused and stable, but the probability of an actual
injury is small. This laser will not pose either a fire hazard or diffuse-reflection hazard.
A2.7. Class 3B Laser System: May be hazardous under direct and specular reflection viewing
conditions, but is normally not a diffuse reflection or fire hazard.
A2.8. Class 4 Laser System: Is a hazard to the eye or skin from the direct beam, and may pose
a diffuse reflection or fire hazard. It may also produce laser generated air contaminants and
hazardous plasma radiation.
