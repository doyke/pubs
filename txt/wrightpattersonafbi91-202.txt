     have a wing safety office meeting requirements of the AFI 91-204_AFMCSUP. The
     convening authority for off-duty Motor Vehicle and Ground and Industrial category Class C
     and D mishaps and Class E events is delegated to the 88 ABW/CC.
1.2. Mishap Review Panel (MRP).
     1.2.1. 88 ABW/SE will ensure mishap recommendations for all safety disciplines for which
     they are OPR are addressed every six months. 88 ABW/SE will provide a mishap

     with access to mishap reports and/or who investigate mishaps. These individuals will be
     required to access the Air Force Portal, Air Force Safety Center, JAG, Protecting Privilege

   to being approved by the installation commander or designated representative for each
   exercise. The complete draft exercise package is required to be coordinated with the
   installation chief of safety no later than 30-days prior to the exercise start date.
4.7. Annual Weapons Safety Inspections.
   4.7.1. 88 ABW Weapons Safety Office (88 ABW/SEW). Conducts an annual weapons
   safety inspection of all host and associate squadron-level units without full-time weapons
   safety personnel unless other requirements are negotiated in a host/tenant support agreement.
