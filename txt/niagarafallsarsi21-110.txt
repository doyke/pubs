This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and Space
Maintenance. It extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101, Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) Sup 1, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management. It provides
guidance and procedures for debriefing of aircrews during normal and non-duty work hours, the
identification of repeat/recurring discrepancies, notifying the Quality Assurance (QA) Section of
all aborts/incidents and inputting flying time. It applies to all personnel, military and civilian,
assigned to the 914th and 107th Airlift Wings in accordance with (IAW) technical order (TO) 00-
20-1, Aerospace Vehicle Inspection and Documentation. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) at the 914 th /107th
MXO, Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station (ARS), NY. Ensure that all records created as a result
of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. Section 5
has been deleted in its entirety and Section 6 renumbered to Section 5 along with its sub-
paragraphs. Paragraph 5.1 requires MOC to make a copy of the aircrew form, and return the
original back to the aircrew. Paragraph 5.2 deletes the update of the monthly 303; this is done at
 2                                         NIAGARAFALLSARSI21-110 6 FEBRUARY 2012


take-off. Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information, has been added.
Attachments 2 and 3 have been re-accomplished and re-named.
1. Policies. Debriefing will be accomplished IAW this instruction, using one of the following
methods:
     1.1. During normal duty hours, the MOC will accomplish a face to face aircrew debriefing
     using AFI 21-101, Air Mobility Command (AMC) Sup Checklist (CL)-1, C-130 Debrief
     Checklist   located    at   http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFI21-
     101_AMCSUPCL-1.pdf, as a guide.
     1.2. During non-duty hours or a non-duty day, a face to face aircrew debriefing will be
     performed by the Crew Chief using the Team Niagara Debriefing Worksheet (Attach 3), or
     the AMC form 278. The Air Mobility Command (AMC) Sup Checklist (CL)-1, C-130
     Debriefing Checklist, can be used as a guide to the fullest extent possible. The next duty day,
     a complete review of the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document,
     will be performed by the Aircraft Production Superintendent/Expeditor and the forms taken
     to the MOC to complete the Debrief process, prior to the daily maintenance production
     meeting.
     1.3. Missions landing with other than code 1 discrepancies, a specialist and debriefer will
     meet the air crew at debrief to discuss the discrepancies.
     1.4. The aircrew will identify the fault reporting code for each discrepancy. If required,
     MOC debriefer/crew chief will ensure fault reporting codes are included for all discrepancies
     in the aircraft forms.
2. Procedures:
     2.1. Debriefing is conducted at the termination of each sortie/mission or when a
     sortie/mission is aborted.
     2.2. Whenever G081 is down or not readily available, MOC will document aircraft
     debriefing discrepancies on a locally devised debrief worksheet/JCN log. Cannibalization
     (CANN) discrepancies will be accurately recorded on a locally devised cannibalization log.
     When G081 comes back on line, MOC will input all data to maintain historical integrity of
     aircraft. As a minimum, the last four automated debriefing sortie recaps will be maintained in
     the Sortie Recap File Book for discrepancy identification.
     2.3. Deployed Debriefing Procedures. Use automated debrief tools as the primary debriefing
     instrument. If G081 is available at the deployed location, G081 will be used. If G081 is
     unavailable, a locally devised debrief worksheet/JCN log will be used. Retain duplicates at
     the deployed site to help in future debriefings. Turn-in, validate and reconcile paperwork
     from the last five missions to MOC upon re-deployment.
     2.4. Missions exceeding 24 hours off station, the aircraft commander will be responsible for
     calling in daily aircraft status when the status changes to non-mission capable (NMC) to the
     Niagara Falls Command Post during normal duty hours. In-turn, the Command Post will call
     the MOC with aircraft status.
     2.5. Aircraft debriefing discrepancies will be input into G081 from screen 9050. JCN’s will
     be assigned from the Manual JCN and Debrief Log. JCN’s will be issued IAW Maintenance
     Group Operating Instruction (MXGOI) 21-123, Job Control Numbers.
NIAGARAFALLSARSI21-110 6 FEBRUARY 2012                                                          3


   2.6. The Julian date used to create JCN will be the Julian date aircraft departed on mission or
   flight.
3. Repeat/Recurring Discrepancies. Repeats and recurs will be identified by the MOC upon
input to G081, screen 9050.
   3.1. Repeat – Enter (1) on G081 screen 9050 (repeat/recur block), and notify QA IAW
   Paragraph 1.3
   3.2. Recurring – Enter (2) on G081 screen (9050) enter (repeat/recur block), and notify QA
   IAW Paragraph 1.3
4. Abort/Incident Reporting: Air abort determinations are made by MOC with information
provided by Operations. The MOC will use the locally developed Abort/Incident Information
Worksheet, Attachment 2, to provide the QA section with abort and incident information. A
completed copy of the worksheet will be provided to QA immediately upon completion of the
debriefing process, or when notified of an aircraft incident.
   4.1. The Production Superintendent/Expediter or designee is responsible for: Providing
   dropped object, aborts or in-flight emergency (IFE), flight control impoundment actions,
   Foreign Object Damage (FOD), bird strike and engine malfunction information to MOC
   using Attachment 2.
   4.2. The MOC is responsible for: Upon receiving notification of a dropped object, abort or
   IFE, flight control impoundment action, FOD, bird strike and engine malfunction
   information, MOC initiating the applicable emergency action checklist (REF: MOC
   Emergency Action Checklists) listing required actions and personnel and/or offices to be
   notified during such discoveries. This procedure is necessary to ensure that key personnel
   are alerted and that any required reports can be filed.
      4.2.1. At debrief, when requested, the MOC will enter Dropped Object inspection (DOP)
      into GO81 and notify the Production Supervisor and/or Expeditor when action is
      accomplished.
   4.3. MOC will notify QA and Plans, Scheduling, and Documentation (PS&D) of all
   abort/incident occurrences for investigation purposes and possible impoundment procedures.
   4.4. For non-duty hours or a non-duty day incident reporting where there is a possibility for
   aircraft impoundment, the senior maintenance team member will refer to MXGOI 21-106,
   Aircraft Impoundment, and contact one of the following MXG officials:
      4.4.1. *Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) Superintendent
      4.4.2. *Maintenance Squadron (MXS) Superintendent
      4.4.3. *Maintenance Operations Flight (MOF) Superintendent
      4.4.4. *QA Superintendent
      4.4.5. MXS Commander
      4.4.6. MOF Commander
      4.4.7. MXG Vice Commander
      4.4.8. MXG Commander

        4.4.9. The above noted with ―*‖ Indicates primary contact
5. Flying Time.
     5.1. MOC will input flying time from AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
     Document, into G081, Screen 9020.
     5.2. MOC will check flying time against AFTO Form 781 by using G081 screen 8038.
     Ensure takeoff times and landing times, total sortie time and departure and arrival locations
     match.
