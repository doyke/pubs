This Instruction establishes the Hill Air Force Base (Hill AFB) Juvenile Rehabilitative Program
(JRP) and provides program guidance. It implements AFPD 31-1, Integrated Defense. It
prescribes youth (defined as anyone under the age of eighteen years) misconduct prevention
programs and outlines standard procedures for dealing with youth misconduct. It applies to all
active duty and retired US military dependents whose sponsors are assigned and/or attached,
either as permanent party or on temporary duty at Hill AFB, whose family members reside on or
use facilities on Hill AFB. The objective of this instruction is to provide safe and secure living
and working conditions for Air Force employees, members, and their families. It attempts to
prevent misconduct through a clear policy on dealing with misconduct. When juvenile
misconduct does occur, it seeks to rehabilitate youth through intermediate actions short of
barment. The program also provides a means in which to interact with the juvenile offender and
to foster positive relationships between offenders and 75th Security Forces Squadron (75 SFS).
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the office of primary responsibility using AF FORM 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication. This instruction requires the collection and
maintenance of information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974. The authority to collect and
maintain the records prescribed by this instruction is 10 USC 8013. Each form, format, or form

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision changes the certifying official from the Staff Judge Advocate (OO-ALC/JA) to
75th Security Forces Squadron Commander (75 SFS/CC). It removes 75th Force Support
Squadron/Family Support (75 FSS/FSFR), 75th Air Base Wing/Safety (75 ABW/SA), and the
Army & Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) general manager from responsibilities related to
the JRP. It changes the responsibility of the unit first sergeant to receive the initial information
letter and their responsibility to ensure it is complete and returned to 75 Security Forces
Squadron Police Services Section (paragraph 2.7.1). It adds an attachment and references on the
criteria for JRP consideration (paragraph 1.1 and Attachment 2); attachments were re-
sequenced.
1. General. The 75th Mission Support Group Commander (75 MSG/CC) is directly responsible
for the JRP. The military sponsor and spouse are directly responsible for controlling their
dependents while on Hill AFB.
    1.1. The Juvenile Misconduct Review Board's (JMRB) purview, as to what is seen by the
    board, lies in the Assimilative Acts Law and Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5525.5,

    to address crimes as they would be addressed by the state of Utah. The JRMB consisting of
    the 75 MSG/CC, 75 MSG/CD, OO-ALC/JA, 75 FSS/FSFY, 75 MDOS/SGOWF, and 75
    SFS/S5SP will only see class B and C misdemeanors and infraction cases. A misdemeanor is
    an offense lower than a felony, punishable by a county jail term of up to one year or a fine.
    An infraction is a minor offense punishable by a fine only.

       2.2.1. Chairs the JMRB and reviews its recommendations.
       2.2.2. Signs correspondence directing disciplinary administrative action.
    2.3. OO-ALC/JA.
       2.3.1. Reviews all juvenile cases and makes recommendations of disposition to 75
       MSG/CD.

3. Juvenile Misconduct Review Board (JMRB). When a juvenile offender is identified by
Security Forces Operations (75 SFS/S3O), the juvenile will be turned over to his sponsor, or a
responsible adult, and issued an information letter (Attachment 3) outlining the JMRB process.
75 SFS/S3O personnel will assign a date to the information letter and advise the sponsor they

       of the sponsor/parent.
       3.4.2. Caseworkers and sponsors/parents will ensure the youth is not exposed to
       hazardous environments, adult offenders (suspected or adjudicated), areas where
       alcoholic beverages or controlled substances are available, and areas that may adversely
       affect the morals of the youth.
    3.5. Chairperson. The board chairperson will make the final determination on actions to be
    taken.
       3.5.1. If the action includes the JRP, it will be outlined in a contract (Attachment 5)

       3.5.2. Action other than entrance into the JRP will be handled through normal command
       channels.
    3.6. Completed Cases. Any case, which has been successfully completed, will be reviewed
    for closure.

    SAMPLE JUVENILE MISCONDUCT REVIEW BOARD INFORMATION LETTER

MEMORANDUM FOR SSGT JOHN E. DOE (SPONSOR OF BILLIE DOE)

FROM: 75 MSG/CD
      7285 4th Street, Suite 100
      Hill Air Force Base, Utah 84056-5206

SUBJECT: Juvenile Rehabilitation Program

1. As the Deputy Commander, 75th Mission Support Group, I invite you and your dependent to
participate in the Juvenile Rehabilitation Program (JRP). It is my responsibility to determine
appropriate punishment for juveniles involved in misconduct occurring on Hill AFB. Air Force
Instruction 36-3026, Identification Cards for Members of the Uniformed Services, Their Family
Members, and Other Eligible Personnel, dictates that juveniles who commit acts of misconduct
may have their base privileges suspended, curtailed, or revoked. In extreme or repeat cases, the
installation commander may bar juveniles from base, thereby preventing a family from residing
in base housing. Our goal is to work with the juvenile involved to prevent the situation from
getting to a more serious level.

2. The JRP is one method we use at Hill AFB to work with juveniles involved in misconduct.
The JRP is a fully voluntary rehabilitative program and may include punishment, education,
restitution, community service, counseling and/or loss of privileges for the youth, and it requires
the full support of parents to be effective. The JRP is designed to encourage juveniles to be more
responsible for their actions, and offer parents a more formal approach to discipline. This board
itself is not a criminal proceeding.

3. As chairman of the JRP, I have the option to refer your dependent’s case directly to off-base
civilian juvenile authorities, or the matter may be referred to the JRP. Normally, a juvenile
accused of misconduct and who is offered the option to participate in the JRP will be provided an
opportunity to meet the Juvenile Misconduct Review Board. The board will evaluate the case
along with a voluntary input from the juvenile and the juvenile’s parents or sponsors. The board
provides an opportunity to present information that could lead to a rehabilitative program of
community service, counseling, class attendance, or other appropriate activity. The board will
present their recommendation to me. As chairman of the JRP, I have the discretion to impose
suspension, curtailment, or revocation of base privileges regardless of the board’s
recommendations. Each sanction is based upon the circumstances of the misconduct.

4. While the Hill JRP is not meant to take the place of or do away with your part in
disciplining your dependent, it does provide a more formal rehabilitative tool to help you
and your dependent. Your active involvement in this program can weigh heavily in your
favor if further disciplinary actions are considered.

   5. If you elect to have your dependent participate in the JRP, sign this memorandum and
return it to the NCOIC of Police Services (75 SFS/S5SP). Your reply is requested by ______-
HILLAFBI31-202 16 OCTOBER 2009                                                                    9


_______. Your unit first sergeant or commander will notify you of the date and time of the
board. You will be required to attend with your dependent. If you want your dependent to
participate in the JRP but do not wish to meet the full board, you may request a waiver from me
through 75 SFS/S5SP. If you have any questions or comments concerning the JRP, please
contact 75 SFS/S5SP at (801) 777-1868.

FROM: Juvenile Misconduct Review Board
      Local Base Address

SUBJECT: Juvenile Rehabilitation Program (JRP) Options

1. The JRP offers you the opportunity to give back positively to the Hill AFB community. You
may suggest the length of time and kind of community service you desire to perform. The
Juvenile Misconduct Review Board will support your request or recommend another option
based on the offense and your explanation. I will make the final decision. Options available
include, but are not limited to:

  a. Community Service. Examples include: Working with services organizations or with
AAFES, or providing restitution to victims.

  b. Revocation of Privileges. Examples Include: Services, BX, Commissary, base housing.
(The installation commander also may revoke base access privileges.)

   c. Attending classes and seminars individually and as a family. Examples include:
Substance/drug abuse, understanding your teen/school-age child, self-concept, strengthening
Systematic Training for Effective Parenting (STEP) families, STEP classes, building family
strengths, parent/teen communication, adult communication workshops and stress management.

     d. Family counseling and/or individual counseling for family members.

   e. Writing essays and speaking to various groups on lessons learned, identifying values,
providing information and suggesting alternatives.

2. The goal of the JRP is to help individuals and families deal positively with situations that are
difficult, and in some cases, illegal. Progress reports will be signed weekly and used to
document attendance and performance of community service. We want to help, but you must
decide that help is needed. The choice is yours.
