This pamphlet provides procedural guidance to enlisted administrative discharge boards
convened under Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen, and
AFI 51-602, Boards of Officers, including a suggested format for the written record of the board
proceedings and a suggested script that will assist the board‟s legal advisor in conducting the
proceedings in an orderly and efficient manner. This pamphlet implements Air Force Policy
Directive (AFPD) 36-32, Military Retirements and Separations, and does not apply to US Air
Force Reserve or Air National Guard units and members.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change eliminates all references to discharge for enlisted Airmen based on
homosexual conduct. A margin bar (│) indicates newly revised material.

                                            Chapter 1

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose, Function, and Duties. An administrative discharge board is a fact-finding and
recommending board. The functions and duties of a board appointed to consider a case under
AFI 36-3208 are purely administrative, not judicial. An administrative discharge board has four
basic decisions and recommendations to make. First, is there a reason for discharge? The board
must develop and review the evidence in the case. From this evidence the board must decide if
the facts as alleged by the commander are correct. A finding of fact on each allegation in the
notification letter is required. The board‟s findings of fact will determine whether or not there is
a reason for discharge. Second, should the member be discharged? If the board finds facts
which are a reason for discharge, then the board must recommend whether the respondent should
be discharged or retained. Third, what service characterization should the respondent receive
for the current enlistment? If the board recommends a discharge, it must also recommend the
type of service characterization. Finally, should the respondent be given an opportunity for
probation and rehabilitation? The board does not make a finding concerning the respondent‟s
medical qualification for world-wide duty.
1.2. Basic Procedures and Guidance. Under AFI 36-3208, paragraph 8.6, the legal advisor to
an enlisted administrative discharge board has a number of specified responsibilities both prior to
and during the hearing. The legal advisor consults, as necessary, with the recorder or
respondent‟s counsel at any time prior to or after the convening of the board to: (1) prepare for
the hearing; (2) clarify issues; and (3) rule on admissibility of evidence and other issues not
requiring the presence of voting members. In addition, the legal advisor must instruct the board
on its functions, duties, and procedures and advise the board on other appropriate matters
throughout the hearing. While AFIs 36-3208 and 51-602 provide the substantive guidance for
enlisted administrative discharge boards, this pamphlet will assist the legal advisor in conducting
an orderly and efficient hearing. The legal advisor must also remember, however, that this
pamphlet is only a suggested procedural guide. Deviation from this suggested format may be
necessary to follow Air Force policy expressed in AFI 36-3208, AFI 51-602, or in other
instructions or sources of authority. A failure to follow these guidelines does not constitute an
error and provides no grounds to set aside or modify the proceedings. No rights or benefits are
created for any party to the discharge board proceedings solely from the guidelines contained in
this pamphlet.
1.3. Applicability. This pamphlet applies to all enlisted administrative discharge boards
initiated under AFI 36-3208 and AFI 51-602.
1.4. Rules of Evidence. The rules of evidence are stated in AFI 36-3208 and AFI 51-602.
1.5. Abbreviations Explained. The following abbreviations are used throughout the suggested
format for administrative board proceedings and the suggested board script (chapter 2.):

1.6. Arrangement of the Boardroom. The legal advisor should ensure that the arrangement of
the boardroom is consistent with the decorum required of an administrative discharge board
hearing. The voting members of the board should seat themselves with the president in the
center, and the other members should be seated alternately to the right and the left of the
president in descending order of grade. The legal advisor should be careful to make sure that the
other board participants, as well as the reporter and any witnesses, are seated in a manner that
facilitates an orderly and efficient hearing.
1.7. Spectators. Because of the personal nature of the hearing, the legal advisor should exclude
spectators from the boardroom. The legal advisor may permit spectators upon the respondent‟s
request if the legal advisor finds that the presence of spectators will not disrupt or interfere with
the orderly nature of the proceedings.
1.8. Witnesses. The legal advisor should normally exclude all witnesses from the boardroom
except during the time each is testifying before the board. The foregoing does not apply to the
respondent, even if the respondent intends to make a sworn or unsworn statement.
1.9. Attorney Consultations. The legal advisor may consult with the recorder and the
respondent‟s counsel at any time prior to the convening of the board to prepare for the hearing
and clarify issues. The recorder and the respondent‟s counsel may also consult with each other,
as necessary. Counsel will advise the legal advisor and opposing counsel of the names of their
prospective witnesses and proposed exhibits. Counsel will also state all objections which they
anticipate making in the board proceedings. This will allow the legal advisor and opposing
counsel to prepare for the issues and will eliminate unnecessary delays. Every effort should be
made during these consultations to narrow and define the areas of disagreement. These
consultations are not part of the board proceedings and will not be recorded or transcribed as part
of the proceedings. The respondent does not have a right to be present during these consultations.
1.10. Hearing Without Voting Board Members. The legal advisor may, at any time, convene
a hearing outside the presence of the voting board members. During these sessions, the legal
advisor should rule on the admissibility of evidence and address any other issues which do not
require the presence of the voting members. These meetings are recorded and transcribed as part
of the record of the board proceeding. The respondent has the right to be present during these
hearings.
1.11. Record of Board Proceedings. Figure 1.1 provides a suggested format for the record of
proceedings. AFI 36-3208, table 8.2, explains when a record of proceedings must be verbatim or
summarized. If the board recommends retention and the case will not be forwarded to the Office
of the Secretary of the Air Force according to AFI 36-3208, paragraph 1.2, then the summarized
record need only contain sufficient information to establish that the board was properly
convened. The findings and recommendations will be verbatim. The recommendation for
discharge, the notification letter, the convening and amending orders, the discharge authority‟s
action, and the exhibits will be used as a record of board proceedings in such cases. In all other
summarized record or proceedings, the testimony must be summarized.

1.12. Authentication of Board Proceedings. Figure 1.2 provides a suggested format for
authentication of the board proceedings.
1.13. Respondent’s Personnel Records. The respondent‟s personnel records are admissible
into evidence. Since the personnel records are available to all levels of command, copies of the
personnel records need not be made and appended to the record as an exhibit. The record should
clearly reflect that the respondent‟s personnel records were offered and admitted into evidence
for the board‟s consideration. The legal advisor should also reflect on the record that the
personnel records are available to the reviewing authorities but will not be made part of the
record. Copies of airman performance reports and personnel documents supporting the reasons
for discharge must still be included in the case file and made a part of the record.

Respondent‟s acknowledgment of that notice is dated                                       .I

LA:
(Chief) (Sergeant) (Airman)                                                  , this board is
convened to hear evidence concerning                on your part and to recommend to the
convening authority whether you should be discharged prior to the expiration of your term of
service.
As Respondent in this case you have the following rights:
First, you have the right to appear before all open sessions of this Board in person, with or
without counsel, or, in your absence, be represented by counsel at all open sessions of this Board.
Second, you have the right to challenge for cause any voting member of this Board.
Third, you have the right to request the appearance before this Board of any witness whose
testimony you believe can contribute materially to this case. If you desire, you may ask the
Recorder to assist you in securing witnesses. Those witnesses will be invited to appear at no
expense to you, provided that I determine the testimony is not cumulative; the personal
appearance of the witnesses is essential to a fair determination on the issues of separation or
characterization; written or recorded testimony will not adequately accomplish the same
objective; the need for live testimony is substantial, material, and necessary for a proper
disposition of the case; and the significance of the personal appearance favors production of the
witnesses. You or your counsel may question any witness personally appearing before the Board.
Fourth, you are entitled to all rights granted by Article 31, Uniform Code of Military Justice.
You may or may not provide sworn testimony before the Board. This is your decision. If you
decide to do so, you will be subject to cross-examination like any other witness before the Board.
If you do not elect to provide sworn testimony, you may make an unsworn statement to the
Board either personally or through counsel, orally, in writing, or both. If you make an unsworn
statement in person or through counsel, you will not subject yourself to cross-examination. If
you do not choose to testify or make a statement, the Board will not consider your silence as an
admission of the truth of the evidence the Recorder has presented against you.
Fifth, in accordance with AFI 51-602, you have the right during the proceedings of this Board
to submit any evidence you may desire the Board to consider, including sworn or unsworn
statements, affidavits, certificates, stipulations, and depositions.
Finally, you may request that the convening authority appoint one or more enlisted members to
the Board. However, in that event, the convening authority will ensure that a majority of the
Board consists of commissioned officers, and all enlisted members are in the grade of Master
 12                                                         AFPAM36-3210 1 NOVEMBER 1995


Sergeant (E-7) or above (and are senior to you in grade).
NOTE: When the Respondent has an appointment as Reserve of the Air Force, commissioned
or warrant officer, the Legal
Advisor will advise the Respondent as follows:
LA:
This proceeding is also directed towards arriving at a recommendation as to whether you should
retain your appointment as a Reserve of the Air Force (commissioned or warrant) officer.
NOTE: See AFI 36-3208, paragraph 8.11, before proceeding.
LA:
Do you understand the purpose of this Board and your rights as Respondent before it?
RES:
(Yes) (No).
NOTE: If the Respondent indicates a lack of understanding of his or her rights, the Legal
Advisor will pursue the matter until
the Respondent‟s understanding is complete.
LA:
Counsel, prior to hearing any argument regarding evidence in this case, I would like to inform
you of some procedural guidelines which will apply. Both the Recorder and the Respondent‟s
Counsel may question the Board members.               Each may make an opening statement.
Respondent‟s Counsel may make an opening statement immediately following the Recorder or
reserve the opening statement until just prior to the presentation of the Respondent‟s case.
Closing argument will begin with the Recorder, who will then be followed by the Respondent‟s
Counsel. The Recorder will be given an opportunity to argue in rebuttal, if desired. I remind
each counsel that this is an administrative proceeding and not a court-martial.
You should address me by my grade and name.
Does either counsel desire that I rule on the question of the admissibility of evidence?
Is there anything further we need to discuss?
This hearing without the voting members is now over. The Board will convene at ————
—, on                               , in this room (Room ——————).
NOTE: Procedures for Recessing or Adjourning the Board:
(Generally a recess is taken for a period during the current day. Adjournment is generally used
as a means to continue the session the following day or at a later named date.) The following
procedure is suggested in the event either a recess or adjournment becomes necessary:
LA:
The Board will now (recess)(adjourn) and will reconvene at ————————————, on.
                      .
NOTE: Upon reconvening the Board the following procedure is suggested.

REC:
The Board is convened at _____________________________, on
___________________________, at_________________________, pursuant to Special Order
_____________, previously admitted as Government Exhibit 1, a copy of which has been

under the provisions of AFI 36-3208, chapter 5, section _______, paragraph ___________. The
Respondent received notice of this hearing on __________________________. Respondent‟s
acknowledgment of that notice is dated ______________. The Legal Advisor has previously

advocate of the U.S. Air Force who has been certified under Article 27(b) of the Uniform Code
of Military Justice, and (if applicable) (civilian counsel, name, and address)
__________________________________________________, who is a

REC:
The following members of the Board are absent: (The Recorder recites names and grades of
absent members and reasons for their absence).
REC:
The Legal Advisor, the Reporter, and the Recorder have been previously sworn.
LA:
(To voting members). Before proceeding with this hearing, I want to advise you of several
matters relating to the duties of the various people present.
As Legal Advisor, I ensure that the Respondent receives a fair, impartial, and orderly hearing. I
will rule on the admissibility of evidence, upon procedural matters, and on other questions and
objections arising during the Board hearing. My rulings are final and not subject to objection by
any member of the Board.
At the conclusion of the presentation of evidence in this hearing and prior to findings, I will
advise you on the matters you must consider and the procedures you must follow while you are
in closed session to determine your findings and recommendations.
As a voting member of this Board, each of you has a duty and responsibility to act as an
impartial fact-finder in this case.
Your findings and recommendations will be of great significance not only to the Respondent but
also to the United States Air Force. After hearing the Government‟s and Respondent‟s evidence,
you will then draw certain conclusions from the facts that you have found, and make appropriate
findings and recommendations concerning disposition of this case. In every instance, your
recommendations should be consistent with your findings of facts. In this regard, you should not
make recommendations on the theory that they are merely advisory and may be changed by the
convening or higher authority.
LA:
An administrative discharge board has four basic decisions and recommendations to make. First,
is there a reason for discharge? The Board must develop and review the evidence in the case.
From this evidence the Board must decide if the facts as alleged by the commander are correct. A
finding of fact on each allegation in the letter of notification is required. The Board‟s findings of
fact will determine whether or not there is a reason for discharge. Second, should the member be
discharged? If the Board finds facts which are a reason for discharge, then the board must
recommend whether the member should be discharged or retained. Third, what service
characterization should the member receive for the current enlistment? If the board recommends
a discharge, it must also recommend the type of service characterization.
Finally, should the member be given an opportunity for probation and rehabilitation? You must
avoid forming any opinion in this case until all the evidence has been presented by both sides.
You will have an opportunity to deliberate fully in closed session. Each of you must be satisfied
that you can, fairly and impartially, hear this case and make your findings and recommendations.
At a later point in the proceedings, you may be questioned concerning this. If any board member
is not satisfied that they can act impartially, they should so state at that time.

The Board is governed by the procedures outlined in AFI 51-602 and the procedures and policies
set forth in AFI 36-3208. You have been directed to familiarize yourselves with these procedures
and directives prior to today. Have all of you done this? Do each of you feel that you are
qualified to serve as a voting member of this board? (All voting members have responded
affirmatively.)
NOTE: If there is a negative response to either question, the Legal Advisor should recess the
proceedings to allow the voting member or members an opportunity to comply with this
requirement.
LA:
The Recorder, _________________________, serves as the Government‟s representative and
will present the Government‟s evidence. The Respondent, with the assistance of counsel,
______________________, has the right to submit additional evidence. Evidence, as I use that
term here, consists only of documents properly admitted before you and the admissible testimony
of witnesses. If extraneous matter should come to your attention, or if evidence, once admitted, is
later excluded, you must appropriately disregard such evidence. I will instruct you if that is
necessary.
The Recorder and Respondent‟s Counsel will also present arguments for your consideration.
Although arguments are not evidence, you should carefully consider them, since such arguments
may help you in meeting your responsibilities of finding facts and making recommendations.
The counsel who calls a witness is ordinarily the first to conduct examination of the witness.
When that examination has been concluded, cross-examination may follow. When the Recorder
and Respondent‟s Counsel have both completed their questioning, you may ask questions. You
should exercise caution and good judgment in this area. It is sometimes easy to become
overzealous and forget or ignore the responsibility of remaining impartial. If you find it
necessary to ask questions, please try to confine your questions to matters bearing on issues
properly before this Board. Notes may be taken as the testimony proceeds.
LA:
The members of the Board, as well as the Recorder and Respondent‟s Counsel, may not make
“off-the-record” statements. If comment on a witness‟s testimony is necessary, the Recorder or
Respondent‟s Counsel may refer to it during final argument. Additionally, you may refer to it
while you are in closed session.
An administrative board is not bound by formal rules of evidence prescribed for trials by courts-
martial. Furthermore, an administrative board does not employ the rigorous “beyond-a-
reasonable-doubt” standard of persuasion that criminal courts use. On the contrary,
administrative boards seek to find all the relevant facts from the best evidence that is available,
and they employ a “preponderance-of-the-evidence” test in making their findings. A
preponderance of the evidence means the greater weight of credible evidence. That is to say,
boards find their facts according to the weight of all the credible evidence that is properly before
them.
Are there any questions?

LA:
The Respondent has an absolute right to have a panel of impartial board members hear this case.
Therefore, you must disclose any and all grounds for challenge that may exist. The following
reasons are proper grounds for challenge: that you are not eligible to serve on administrative
discharge boards; that you have not been properly appointed to this Board; that you have been an
investigating officer, staff judge advocate, convening authority, or counsel for either side; that
you have formed or expressed a positive and definite opinion as to the disposition to be made in
this case; or any other reasons which would cast substantial doubt as to the legality, fairness, or
impartiality of the hearing.
Recorder, do your records indicate any grounds for challenge?
REC:
(Yes)(No), ___________________________________________.
LA:
I am aware of no grounds for challenge for cause against me. Does either counsel have a
challenge for cause?
REC:
The Government has no challenge for cause against the Legal Advisor,
___________________________.
RC:
The Respondent (does)(does not) challenge the Legal Advisor for cause.
NOTES:
1. Challenges for cause against the Legal Advisor should be stated in the presence of the voting
members. Each side shall be provided an opportunity to present evidence in support of such
challenge in the voting member‟s presence.
2. The Board shall hear evidence on the challenge to the Legal Advisor and then, in closed
session, the President of the Board shall announce his or her ruling on the challenge. The
President shall then poll the other voting members to see if they object to his or her ruling, and
unless a majority of the voting members object, the President‟s ruling shall be final. The
President shall announce the ruling in open session.
LA:
Members of the Board: In discussing grounds for challenge for cause, it is important that you
avoid reference to any specific facts which may disqualify the other members of the Board if
heard by them. Therefore, when you answer any of the following questions, please confine your
answers to the general nature of the matter and avoid specific references to any facts.
Does any member of the Board write or indorse the effectiveness or performance report of any
other member of the Board?
MEMS: __________________________________________________.

NOTE: If any member writes or indorses another member‟s effectiveness performance report,
the Legal Advisor should examine both members to ensure that each member will be
independent and impartial. The mere fact that one member writes or indorses another member‟s
effectiveness or performance report is not grounds for challenge in and of itself.
LA:
Does any member of the Board know the Respondent, Respondent‟s Counsel, or the Recorder?
MEMS: _______________________________________________.
NOTE: In the event that any member knows any of the participants, the Legal Advisor should
establish whether that relationship may influence that member‟s deliberations.

Members of the Board: In a few moments you will go into closed session to determine your
findings and recommendations. In doing so, you will be guided by the instructions I am about to
give you, by the directives which I will leave with you, and by evidence admitted before you in
open session.
You should become thoroughly familiar with the commander‟s (allegation)(allegations) because
your first order of business during deliberation will be to decide whether the (allegation)
(allegations) (is)(are) true.
LA:
The commander alleges the following: [Quote one or more allegations _______________
______________________________________________________________________________
_____________
_______________________________________________________________.]
The primary function of any administrative board is to develop and review all the information
about the matter under consideration. You must reach findings of fact on each separate allegation
set out in the letter of notification. You should be as specific as possible as to dates, places, and
events. Each finding must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.
An Administrative Discharge Board has four basic decisions and recommendations to make.
First, is there a reason for discharge? The Board must develop and review the evidence in the
case. From this evidence the Board must decide if the facts as alleged by the commander are
correct. A finding of fact on each allegation in the letter of notification is required. The Board‟s
findings of fact will determine whether or not there is a reason for discharge. Second, should the
member be discharged? If the board finds facts which are a reason for discharge, then the Board
must recommend whether the member should be discharged or retained. Third, what service
characterization should the member receive for the current enlistment? If the Board recommends
a discharge, it must also recommend the type of service characterization. Finally, should the
member be given an opportunity for probation and rehabilitation?
I remind you that an Administrative Discharge Board need not follow the formal rules of
evidence prescribed for trials by courts-martial, and neither does such a board employ the same
rigorous “beyond-a-reasonable-doubt” standard of persuasion that criminal courts use. The
burden of proof is on the Government to establish each allegation in the letter of notification by a
preponderance of the evidence. A preponderance of the evidence simply means the greater
weight of credible evidence. There is no requirement to prove any allegation beyond a
reasonable doubt. You must use your best judgment and common
sense in resolving disputed and conflicting evidence. You must consider the probability or
improbability of each piece of evidence, and select only that evidence which is most worthy of
AFPAM36-3210 1 NOVEMBER 1995                                                                       23


belief. You must be convinced that each fact set forth in your findings is proven to your
satisfaction by a preponderance of credible evidence.
In resolving disputed evidence, it may be necessary to decide the credibility of a witness or
witnesses who are in dispute. The credibility of a witness is the witness‟s worthiness of belief. In
deciding the credibility of a witness, you should consider all of the circumstances. For example,
consider the witness‟s demeanor and manner of testifying; his or her interest, if any, in the
outcome of the case; his or her friendships, biases, and prejudices; and the extent, if any, to
which he or she is supported or contradicted by other evidence. In short, you should consider all
the circumstances that tend to shed light upon credibility, taking into account your own
experience in dealing with people, and then reach your own determination as to truthfulness.
Once you have made this determination, you should find the facts accordingly.
In a few moments I will give you a worksheet to assist you in putting your findings and
recommendation in the proper form.
NOTE: At this point, the Legal Advisor should tailor limiting instructions based upon the
evidence, testimony admitted during the hearing, and on probation and rehabilitation (see
chapters 4 and 6). The Legal Advisor continues with the following closing instructions:
LA:
A majority of the voting members of the Board must concur in each of your findings and
recommendations. (A tie vote will result in a determination favorable to the Respondent on any
issue, and the President will announce this as a majority vote.)
Voting will be by secret written ballot beginning with the findings. You must not vote on
recommendations until you have completed your findings. You must disregard any comment or
statement I have made during the course of these proceedings, or in these instructions, which
may seem to indicate any opinion of mine with respect to the findings or recommendations you
will make in this case. You alone have the independent responsibility for making these decisions.
I will leave a copy of AFI 36-3208 and AFI 51-602 with you during your deliberations. If you
require my help to interpret these directives, or if a question arises with respect to the procedures
you should follow, you may reopen the proceedings and request my help in an open hearing and
in the presence of the Respondent, the Respondent‟s Counsel and the Recorder. If you need help
solely to put findings or recommendations into proper form, you may call me into your closed
session. I will ask the Reporter to be present to record the proceedings verbatim. During your
deliberations, you are to consult no references
other than your own notes and the documents and directives I will give you. You may not consult
with any outside person about this case.
Are there any questions?
BOARD: ________________________________________.

The Board is closed. All persons except the voting members of the Board are excused.
NOTE: After the Board has reached its findings and recommendations the Legal Advisor will

                        EVIDENTIARY LIMITING INSTRUCTIONS

Section A—-Hearsay Evidence

   Members of the Board, I have admitted Government (Exhibit)(Exhibits)                   ) and
Respondent (Exhibit)(Exhibits)        ) into evidence; however, I advise the Board that these
exhibits are hearsay evidence. Hearsay is a statement which is offered into evidence to prove the
truth of the matters in the statement, but which is not made by the author of the statement as a
witness before this Board. I have determined there were adequate safeguards for the truth and
have admitted the hearsay into evidence. You have the burden to decide what reliability and
weight to give to this evidence. In making this determination, you should consider the nature,
effect, authenticity, and circumstances of the statement.
LA:

Section B—-Direct and Circumstantial Evidence

  There are two types of evidence from which you may find the truth as to the facts of this case—
direct and circumstantial evidence. Evidence which tends directly to prove or disprove a fact in
issue is called direct evidence. Circumstantial evidence is that which tends to prove or disprove
not a fact in issue, but a fact or circumstance from which, either alone or in connection with other
facts, a person may, according to the common experience of mankind, reasonably infer the
existence or nonexistence of another fact which is in issue. The law makes no distinction
between the weight to be given to either direct or circumstantial evidence. Nor is a greater degree
of certainty required of circumstantial evidence than of direct evidence.
LA:

Section C—-No Testimony by Respondent

The board will not draw any adverse inference from the fact the respondent did not elect to
testify under oath as a witness. (See Note)
LA:
[NOTE: USE THIS INSTRUCTION                    IF   REQUESTED         BY     RESPONDENT         OR
RESPONDENT‟S COUNSEL.]

Section D—-Unsworn Statement by Respondent

You are advised that an unsworn statement is an authorized means for a respondent to bring
information to the attention of the board, and must be given appropriate consideration. The
respondent cannot be cross-examined by the government or by the board members or myself
upon an unsworn statement, but the government may offer evidence to rebut statements of fact
contained in it.
 26                                                     AFPAM36-3210 1 NOVEMBER 1995


LA:
The weight and significance to be attached to an unsworn statement rests within the sound
discretion of each board member. You may consider that the statement is not under oath, its
inherent probability, whether it is supported or contradicted by evidence in the case, as well as
any other matter that may have a bearing upon its credibility.
In weighing an unsworn statement, you are expected to use your common sense and your
knowledge of human nature and the ways of the world.

Section E—-Commander-Directed Urinalysis

You have heard evidence that the Respondent submitted a urinalysis sample at his commander‟s
direction. AFI 36-3208, paragraph 1.21.4, prohibits you from considering the results of
mandatory testing conducted during a commander-directed examination in determining how the
Respondent‟s service should be characterized. This means that you may consider the positive
urinalysis in deciding whether the Respondent should be discharged. However, if you decide
that the Respondent should be discharged, you must not consider the commander-directed
urinalysis in determining how to characterize the Respondent‟s service (with either a General or
Under Other Than Honorable Conditions Discharge). You may, however, consider the rest of
the Respondent‟s record during (his)(her) current enlistment, including any independently
derived evidence of drug abuse for characterizing the Respondent‟s service.      [This includes
admissions of drug use made by Respondent (and admissions made during his testimony today).]
Thus, although you may not consider the commander- directed urinalysis in deciding the type of
service characterization, you may decide that the Respondent‟s entire record during (his)(her)
current enlistment, excluding the commander-directed urinalysis, warrants a worse type of
discharge than Honorable.
LA:

Section F—-Previously Adjudicated Matters

With respect to your findings of fact, AFI 36-3208, paragraph 8.14, provides that boards may not
enter findings contrary to matters previously adjudicated in courts-martial and civilian court
convictions.
LA:
You have evidence before you that Respondent was convicted by a (civil court) (court-martial)
for the offense of (insert offense).                                            If       you
conclude that the Respondent in fact was convicted of an offense, then you must find as a
fact that the Respondent committed the (offense)(offenses). The respondent may present
matters in mitigation, extenuation, and explanation. Any evidence that I have admitted that
tends to conflict with matters previously adjudicated was admitted for these purposes
only.The fact that the respondent committed the (offense)(offenses) has already been
adjudicated and I may restrict that admission and the use of evidence to prevent a second
adjudication of the offense.
AFPAM36-3210 1 NOVEMBER 1995                                                                    27



Section G—-Entry-Level Status (To be used only if entry-level status is an issue.

   You must also find whether the Respondent is in entry-level status. That is, whether, as of the
date of notification as to the initiation of separation proceeding, the Respondent was within the
first 180 days of continuous active military service, or the first 180 days of continuous active
service after a break of more than 92 days of active service.
LA:

Section H—Preponderance of the Evidence

In discharging this responsibility, you must use your best judgment and common sense in
resolving disputed and conflicting evidence, considering the probability or improbability of the
evidence and selecting and weighing the evidence considered most worthy of belief. You may
make reasonable inference based on evidence, but you must avoid conjecture. In making your
findings, each finding must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.
LA:
Proof by a preponderance of the evidence is proof that a proposition is more likely to be true than
not true. It is evidence in support of the proposition that is more strongly convincing and of
greater weight than evidence in opposition. A preponderance is not to be determined merely by
the number of witnesses called. You may properly believe one witness over several others
whose testimony conflicts with the one. A greater number of witnesses or exhibits is not the
greater weight of the evidence, but opportunity for knowledge, information possessed, and
manner of testifying determines the weight of the testimony. The nature and quality of all the
evidence presented should be your guide in determining whether the burden of proof has been
met.
In summary, a preponderance of evidence is that evidence which, when fairly considered,
produces the stronger impression, has the greater weight, and is more convincing as to its truth
when weighed against any evidence in opposition to it.
After giving all evidentiary limiting instructions, the Legal Advisor should instruct on the
grounds for discharge. (See chapter 5.)

                   INSTRUCTIONS ON GROUNDS FOR DISCHARGE

Section A—-General Guidance

The Legal Advisor must give closing instructions to the Board on the particular grounds for
discharge.
The following sections contain suggested instructions for the possible grounds for involuntary
separation under AFI 36-3208, chapter 5. The Legal Advisor should tailor these suggested
instructions to cover unusual circumstances or issues which may have arisen in the proceedings.
Refer to attachments 1 - 13 as appropriate for guidance concerning drafting a Findings
and Recommendations Worksheet.

Section B—-Involuntary Convenience of the Government Discharge

In the case before us, the Respondent‟s commander, ————————, recommended that the
Respondent be discharged from the United States Air Force with an (Entry-Level Separation).
(Honorable Discharge) under AFI 36-3208, chapter 5, section B because (of Respondent‟s
parenthood) (the Respondent has a condition which interferes with military service, specifically
—————————) (of insufficient retainability for required retraining). The precise factual
basis for the recommendation is set forth in paragraph 2 of the commander‟s notification
letter to the Respondent, dated ———————————, which is before you as
Government Exhibit ———————————————.
LA:
You should become thoroughly familiar with that paragraph, because your first order of business
during deliberations will be to decide whether the (allegation)(allegations) contained in it
(is)(are) true. The commander alleges the following: [Quote one or more allegations


You must reach clear, logical findings of fact as to each allegation in the notification letter.
That is, you must find (with respect to each allegation) whether or not that allegation is true.
If you find that none of the allegations is true, then a recommendation for retention would
naturally follow and should be made by you.
NOTES: The Legal Advisor continues with the following instructions in all cases:
After you have made your findings, you must arrive at one of the following recommendations,
consistent with those findings:
1. Retention in the Air Force. Your recommendation for retention is binding on the separation
authority. You should therefore deliberate fully the effect that such a recommendation will have
both on the Respondent and the Air Force. Note, however, that you may recommend retention
even if you have found that there is a reason for discharge under AFI 36-3208, chapter 5,
section B.
AFPAM36-3210 1 NOVEMBER 1995                                                                 29


2. Discharge with an Honorable Discharge. If you wish to recommend discharge, and the
Respondent is not in entry-level status, then you must recommend discharge with an Honorable
Discharge.
3. Entry-Level Separation. If you wish to recommend discharge, and the Respondent is in
entry-level status, then you must recommend Entry-Level Separation.
In reaching your recommendations, you may consider the Respondent‟s entire military record
to the extent permitted by AFI 36-3208. Specifically, you may consider the entire military
record to determine whether retention or discharge is appropriate.
Airmen who have demonstrated that they are unqualified for further service should be discharged
and their service appropriately characterized.
NOTES:
1. If the Respondent has an appointment as a Reserve of the Air Force commissioned or
warrant officer, the Board must make a recommendation whether the Respondent should retain
the appointment. In such a case, the Legal Advisor should give appropriate instructions. See
AFI 36-3208, paragraph 8.11, before proceeding.
2. After instructing on the grounds for discharge, the Legal Advisor should give an appropriate
instruction on probation and rehabilitation. (See chapter 6.)

Section C—-Defective Enlistments

The Legal Advisor gives the following instructions where the basis for discharge is fraudulent
entry under AFI 36-3208, chapter 5, section C, paragraph 5.15. If the case is based on an
erroneous enlistment under section C, paragraph 5.14, the Legal Advisor must tailor instructions
for that paragraph.
LA:
The Respondent‟s commander, ——————————————, has recommended that
the Respondent, ————————————, be discharged from the United States Air Force
with (an Entry-Level Separation)(an Honorable Discharge) (a General Discharge)(an Under
Other Than Honorable Conditions Discharge) under AFI 36-3208, chapter 5, section C,
because of the Respondent‟s fraudulent entry in to the Air Force.        The basis for this
recommendation is set forth in paragraph 2 of the commander‟s notification letter
to the Respondent, dated ———————, which is Government Exhibit —————. You
should become thoroughly familiar with that paragraph, because your first order of business
during deliberations will be to decide whether the (allegation)(allegations) contained in it
(is)(are) true.
The commander alleges that the Respondent fraudulently entered the Air Force on —————
———— by deliberately (misrepresenting)(omitting)(concealing) the material (fact)(facts) that
(quote one or more specific facts); and that if the (fact)(facts) had been truly stated, the
Respondent might have been rejected for enlistment.              You must address (the)(each)
allegation squarely. You must find(with respect to each allegation) whether or not that
allegation is true. If you find that none of the allegations are true, then a recommendation for
retention would naturally follow and should be made.

In determining whether the Respondent may be discharged, you should refer to the
conditions stated in AFI 36-3208, paragraphs 5.15, 5.17, and 5.18. I specifically advise you
that the Respondent may not be discharged for fraudulent entry unless you find that the
(misrepresentation)(omission)(concealment) was deliberate; and that it concerned a material fact.
[CONCEALMENT OF PRIOR SERVICE]
If the case involves concealment of prior service, and the evidence has raised the issue of
whether the concealment is a reason for discharge for fraud, the Legal Advisor should give the
following instruction:
LA:
In this case, the Respondent allegedly concealed a record of prior service. I advise you that
while deliberate concealment of prior service normally is a reason or discharge for fraudulent
entry, this is not true in the following situations:
1. The prior military service consists of an unterminated enlistment in a Reserve component,
and, before entering the Air Force, the Respondent had not received orders to report to active
service, or to a medical examination in preparation for entry to active duty;
2. The concealed prior service was not the last period of active service; provided, however, that
the last period of active service was disclosed, included at least 2 years of active military service,
and was characterized as honorable; or
3. The concealed prior service was terminated under conditions that, if made known at the time
of entry, would not have been a bar to entry.
If you find that the nature of the Respondent‟s concealed prior service fits one of the categories I
have described, then the Respondent is not subject to discharge for fraudulent entry. You may,
however, determine in such a case that the Respondent should properly be discharged because of
an erroneous enlistment under AFI 36-3208, chapter 5, section C, paragraph 5.14. This would
require an amendment to the notification letter. (See chapter 9.)
NOTE: If the case involves concealment of civil court records, the Legal Advisor should give the
following instructions:

[CONCEALMENT OF CIVIL COURT RECORDS]
LA:
In this case the Respondent allegedly concealed a record of conviction on ——————— —
—————————————— in ————————————— (court) of the offense of
                                                                .
In order for the Respondent to be discharged for concealing a civil court conviction, the Board
must find that the Respondent has such a conviction and deliberately concealed it. The Board
must also find that the Respondent received a sentence which included confinement for 6 months
or more, without regard to suspension or probation, or a similar offense under the Manual for
Courts-Martial United States, 1984, that authorizes a punitive discharge. (In this case the
Respondent was sentenced to————————.) (In this case the same or closely related
offense of —————————————————————————— under the Manual
for Courts-Martial, United States, 1984, is an offense that authorizes a punitive discharge.)
AFPAM36-3210 1 NOVEMBER 1995                                                                  31


NOTE: The Legal Advisor will continue with the following instructions on discharge
characterization:
LA:
After you have made your findings, you must arrive at one of the following recommendations:
1. Retention in the Air Force. Your recommendation for retention is binding on the discharge
authority. You should therefore deliberate fully the effect that such a recommendation will have
both on the Respondent and the Air Force. Note, however, that you may recommend retention
even if there is a reason for discharge.
2. Entry-Level Separation. You should recommend this only if you have concluded both that the
Respondent is in entry-level status, and Under Other Than Honorable Conditions discharge is not
appropriate.
3. Honorable, General Discharge, or Under Other Than Honorable Conditions. Consult AFI
36-3208, chapter 1, section B, for guidance in determining which type of service characterization
would be appropriate.
NOTE: If the case involves concealment of prior service terminated with less than an Honorable
Discharge, normally you should recommend an Under Other Than Honorable Conditions
Discharge.
LA:
In reaching your findings and recommendations, you may consult the Respondent‟s entire
military record in determining whether retention or administrative discharge is appropriate.
Airmen who have demonstrated that they are unqualified for further service should be discharged
and their service appropriately characterized. In making your recommendation as to the type
of service characterization, you may only consider the Respondent‟s military record during the
current enlistment, plus the preservice misrepresentations or omissions of facts which, if known,
would have precluded, postponed, or otherwise affected the Respondent‟s eligibility for
enlistment.
In determining the service characterization, you may not consider misconduct during a prior
enlistment, including convictions by court-martial, records of nonjudicial punishment, or
evidence of other offenses. As I indicated earlier, you should consult AFI 36-3208, chapter 1,
section B, to guide you in determining an appropriate type of service characterization.
NOTES:
1. If the Respondent has an appointment as a Reserve of the Air Force commissioned or
warrant officer, the Board must make a recommendation whether the Respondent should retain
the appointment. In such a case, the Legal Advisor should give appropriate instructions. See
AFI 36-3208, paragraph 8.11, before proceeding.
2. If fraudulent enlistment is the only reason for discharge, the member is not eligible for
probation and rehabilitation under Chapter 7, AFI 36-3208.
3. Where the facts admitted before the Board provide a possible basis for a constructive waiver
of discharge under AFI 36- 3208, paragraph 5.19.3, the Legal Advisor should give the following
instruction:
 32                                                        AFPAM36-3210 1 NOVEMBER 1995


[CONSTRUCTIVE WAIVER]
Evidence has been presented which possibly could form the basis for a constructive waiver of
discharge under AFI 36-3208, paragraph 5.19.3. That determination belongs solely to the
separation authority; therefore, you must make your findings and recommendations without
considering the possible constructive waiver.

Section D—-Unsatisfactory Performance

The Respondent‟s commander, ——————————————, has recommended that the
Respondent be discharged from the United States Air Force with (an Honorable Discharge)(a
General Discharge) under AFI 36-3208, chapter 5, section E, because of the Respondent‟s
unsatisfactory performance. The basis for the recommendation is set forth in paragraph 2 of the
commander‟s notification letter to the Respondent, dated ———————————————,
which is Government Exhibit ——————. You should become thoroughly familiar with that
paragraph, because your first order of business during deliberations will be to decide whether the
(allegation)(allegations) (is)(are) true.
 The commander alleges the following: [Quote one or more allegations ———————
———————————————————————————————————————
————————————————————————————.]
You must address (the)(each) allegation squarely.           You must find [with respect to each
allegation] whether or not that allegation is true. If you find that none of the allegations are true,
then a recommendation for retention would naturally follow and should be made.
After you have made your findings, you must arrive at one of the following recommendations.
1. Retention in the Air Force.      Your recommendation for retention is binding on the
separation authority.       You should therefore deliberate fully the effect that such a
recommendation will have both on the Respondent and the Air Force. Note, however, that you
may recommend retention even if you have found the Respondent may be discharged under AFI
36-3208, chapter 5, section E.
2. Discharge With an Honorable Discharge.
3. Discharge With a General Discharge.
If you recommend discharge in this case, consult AFI 36-3208, chapter 1, section B, for
guidance in determining whether an
Honorable or General Discharge is appropriate.
In reaching your findings and recommendations, you may consult the Respondent‟s entire
military record to the extent permitted by AFI 36-3208. You may consult the entire military
record to determine whether retention or discharge is appropriate.
Airmen who have demonstrated that they are unqualified for further service should be discharged
and their service appropriately characterized.
If you recommend that the Respondent be discharged for unsatisfactory performance, you must
also recommend the type of service characterization. In making your recommendation as to the
service characterization, you may only consider the Respondent‟s military record during the
current enlistment. Specifically, you may not consider preservice or prior service misconduct,
AFPAM36-3210 1 NOVEMBER 1995                                                                       33


including convictions by court-martial, records of nonjudicial punishment, or evidence of other
offenses.
NOTES:
1. If the Respondent has an appointment as a Reserve of the Air Force commissioned or
warrant officer, the Board must make a recommendation whether the Respondent should retain
the appointment. In such a case, the Legal Advisor should give appropriate instructions. See
AFI 36-3208, paragraph 8.11, before proceeding.
2. After instructing on the grounds for discharge, the Legal Advisor should give an appropriate
instruction on probation and rehabilitation. (See chapter 6.)

Section E—-Substance Abuse Treatment Failure

   The Respondent‟s commander, ————————, has recommended that the Respondent be
discharged from the United States Air Force with (an Entry-Level Separation)(an Honorable
Discharge)(a General Discharge) under AFI 36-3208, chapter 5, section F, because the
Respondent has failed in (drug)(alcohol) abuse rehabilitation. The basis for the recommendation
is set forth in paragraph 2 of the commander‟s notification letter to the Respondent, dated ——
——————, which is Government Exhibit ——————. You should become thoroughly
familiar with that paragraph, because your first order of business during deliberations will be to
decide whether the (allegation)(allegations) (is)(are) true.
LA:
The commander alleges the following: [Quote one or more allegations ————————
———————————————————————————————————
————————————————————————————]
You must address (the)(each) allegation squarely. You must find [with respect to each
allegation] whether or not that allegation is true. If you find that none of the allegations are true,
then a recommendation for retention would naturally follow and should be made.
There is a reason for discharge if the Respondent was referred to a program of
rehabilitation for (personal abuse of drugs)(alcohol abuse), and failed to successfully complete
the program due to inability, refusal to participate in the program, or unwillingness to cooperate.
If you do not find that there is a reason for discharge, a recommendation for retention is
appropriate. After you have made your findings, you must arrive at one of the following
recommendations, consistent with those findings:
1. Retention in the Air Force.      Your recommendation for retention is binding on the
separation authority.     You should therefore deliberate fully on the effect that such a
recommendation will have both on the Respondent and the Air Force. Note, however, that you
may recommend retention even if you have found that there is a reason for discharge under AFI
36-3208, chapter 5, section F.
2. Entry-Level Separation. If you wish to recommend discharge, and have made a finding that
the Respondent is in entry- level status, then you must recommend an Entry-Level Separation.
 34                                                      AFPAM36-3210 1 NOVEMBER 1995


3. Discharge with an Honorable or General Discharge. If you wish to recommend discharge,
and the Respondent is not in entry-level status, then you must recommend discharge with either
an Honorable or General Discharge. Consult AFI 36-3208, chapter 1, section B, for guidance in
determining which type of discharge would be appropriate.
In reaching your findings and recommendations, you may consult the Respondent‟s entire
military record to the extent permitted by AFI 36-3208. You may consult the entire military
record to determine whether retention or administrative discharge is appropriate.
Airmen who have demonstrated that they are unqualified for further service should be discharged
and their service appropriately characterized. If you recommend that the Respondent be
discharged, you must also recommend the type of service characterization. As I explained
earlier, your recommendation as to the type of service characterization in this case depends upon
whether or not the Respondent is in entry-level status, as well as upon the guidelines set forth in
AFI 36-3208, chapter 1, section B. In making your recommendations as to the type of service
characterization, you may only consider the Respondent‟s military record during the current
enlistment. You may not consider preservice or prior service misconduct, including records of
courts-martial convictions, records of nonjudicial punishment, or evidence of other offenses.
NOTES:
1. If the Respondent has an appointment as a Reserve of the Air Force commissioned or
warrant officer, the Board must make a recommendation whether the Respondent should retain
the appointment. In such a case, the Legal Advisor should give appropriate instructions. See
AFI 36-3208, paragraph 8.11, before proceeding.
2. After instructing on the grounds for discharge, the Legal Advisor should give an appropriate
instruction on probation and rehabilitation. (See chapter 6.).

Section F—(DELETED)

Section G—-Misconduct

The Respondent‟s commander, ————————, has recommended that the Respondent be
discharged from the United States Air Force with (an Entry-Level Separation)(an Honorable
Discharge)(a General Discharge)(an Under Other Than Honorable Conditions Discharge)
under      AFI 36-3208,       chapter     5,       section      H,      paragraphs  (5.49)(5.50.1)
(5.50.2)(5.50.3)(5.50.4)(5.51)(5.52.1)(5.52.2)(5.54)(5.53), because of (minor disciplinary
infractions)(a pattern of mis- conduct consisting of discreditable involvement with military or
civil authorities)(conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline) (failure to support
dependents)(dishonorable failure to pay just debts)(a civilian conviction)(the commission of a
serious offense, specifically (sexual perversion)(prolonged unauthorized absence) (drug
abuse)(———————)). (Failure to comply with lawfully ordered preventive medicine
procedures for an airman with serologic evidence of HIV infection.) The basis for the
recommendation is set forth in paragraph 2 of the commander‟s notification letter to the
Respondent, dated ————, which is Government Exhibit ——. You should become
thoroughly familiar with that paragraph, because your first order of business during deliberations
will be to decide whether the (allegation)(allegations) (is)(are) true.
AFPAM36-3210 1 NOVEMBER 1995                                                                       35


LA:
The commander alleges the following: [Quote one or more allegations ——————
——————————————————————————————————————
——————————————————————————————————.]
You must address (the)(each) allegation squarely.           You must find [with respect to each
allegation] whether or not that allegation is true. If you find that none of the allegations are true,
then a recommendation for retention would naturally follow and should be made.
NOTE: If the case was initiated under AFI 36-3208, paragraph 5.51, for a civilian conviction,
the Legal Advisor should give the following instructions:
[CIVILIAN COURT CONVICTION]
LA:
There is a reason for discharge for a civilian conviction if you find that the Respondent was
convicted by civilian authorities, or action was taken tantamount to a finding of guilty, if a
punitive discharge would be authorized for the same or a closely related offense under the
Manual for Courts-Martial United States, 1984; or the sentence by civilian authorities includes
confinement for 6 months or more without regard to suspension or probation.
The offense involving the Respondent,                 , (could)(could not) result in a punitive
discharge under the Manual for Courts-Martial United States, 1984, (and)(but) (resulted in
an actual sentence by civilian authorities of confinement for at least 6 months without regard
to suspension or probation)
There is a reason for discharge under Section H if you conclude either that the Respondent (has
been convicted of the civil offense) or (the civil court has taken action which is tantamount to a
finding of guilty).
NOTE: The Legal Advisor continues with the following instructions in all cases:
LA:
After you have made your findings, you must arrive at one of the following recommendations:
1. Retention in the Air Force.      Your recommendation for retention is binding on the
separation authority.    You should therefore deliberate fully the effect that such a
recommendation will have both on the Respondent and the Air Force. Note, however, that you
may recommend retention even if there is a reason for discharge under AFI 36-3208, chapter 5,
section H.
2. Entry-Level Separation. You should recommend this only if you conclude both that the
Respondent is in entry-level status, and an Under Other Than Honorable Conditions Discharge is
not appropriate.
NOTE: Airmen in entry-level status will not be discharged under paragraph 5.49
3. Discharge with an Honorable or General Discharge. If you wish to recommend discharge,
and the Respondent is not in entry-level status, and an Under Other Than Honorable Conditions
Discharge is not appropriate, then you must recommend discharge with either an Honorable or
General Discharge. However, you may only recommend an Honorable Discharge if the
 36                                                     AFPAM36-3210 1 NOVEMBER 1995


Respondent‟s record has been so meritorious that any other characterization would be clearly
inappropriate. In making your determination, you should consult AFI 36-3208, chapter 1,
section B, for guidelines on service characterization.
4. Discharge with an Under Other Than Honorable Conditions Discharge. Usually, discharges
for misconduct under paragraphs 5.50, 5.51, and 5.52 should be an Under Other Than
Honorable Conditions Discharge. You should consult AFI 36-3208, chapter 1, section B, in
determining whether this type of service characterization is appropriate in this case.
[CONSTRUCTIVE WAIVER]
NOTE: Where the facts admitted before the Board provide a possible basis for a
constructive waiver of discharge under AFI 36-3208, paragraph 5.51.3, the Legal Advisor
should give the following instruction:
LA:
Evidence has been presented which possibly could form the basis for a constructive waiver of
discharge under AFI 36-3208, paragraph 5.51.3. Constructive waiver may occur if the
commander has knowledge of the respondent‟s civilian conviction but fails to take prompt
action to initiate discharge. That determination belongs solely to the separation authority;
therefore, you must make your findings and recommendations without considering the possible
constructive waiver.
NOTE: The Legal Advisor continues with the following instructions in all cases:
In reaching your findings and recommendations, you may consult the Respondent‟s entire
military record to the extent permitted by AFI 36-3208. You may consult the entire military
record to determine whether retention or administrative discharge is appropriate.
Airmen who have demonstrated that they are unqualified for further service should be discharged
and their service appropriately characterized. If you recommend that the Respondent be
discharged, you must also recommend the type of service characterization, you may only
consider Respondent‟s military record during the current enlistment. Specifically, you may not
consider preservice or prior service misconduct, including records of courts-martial
conviction, records of nonjudicial punishment, or evidence of other offenses.
[DRUG ABUSE]
NOTE: If the case was initiated under AFI 36-3208, paragraph 5.54, for drug abuse, the
Legal Advisor should give the following instructions.
LA:
This basis for this discharge exists if you find the preponderance of evidence shows the
respondent illegally, wrongfully, or improperly used, possessed, sold, transferred, or introduced
on a military installation any drug. For the purpose of this Board, you are advised that the
following definitions shall apply:
“Drug Abuse” means the illegal, wrongful, improper use, possession, sale, transfer or
introduction onto a military installation of any drug. “Drug Abuse” also includes the improper
use of prescription medication or any other intoxicating substance which might be inhaled,
injected, consumed or introduced into the body in any manner for the purposes of altering mood
or function. Alcohol is not included.
AFPAM36-3210 1 NOVEMBER 1995                                                                      37


The term “drug” means any controlled substance listed on the schedules of controlled substances
located at 21 United States Code Section 812. The term “drug” also includes anabolic or
androgenic steroids. The term “drug” also extends to any intoxicating substance, other than
alcohol, that is inhaled, injected, consumed, or introduced into the body in any manner for the
purpose of altering mood or function.
A “Drug Experimenter” is defined as one who has illegally or improperly used a drug for
reasons of curiosity, peer pressure, or other similar reasons.
“Drug Distribution” is defined as the delivery to the possession of another. Distribution does
not occur with the transfer of drug(s) from one person to another while such persons are
engaged in the mutual use of drugs, except that individuals who obtain or arrange for obtaining
the drug(s) used by others are involved in distribution.
“Delivery” is defined as the actual, constructive, or attempted transfer of drug(s) whether or not
an agency relationship exists.
If you find that the Respondent did what is alleged, you are not required to make any further
findings, depending on your assessment of the evidence, but you may nevertheless consider
recommending retention if, and only if, you find that all of the following mitigating and
extenuating factors are present by a preponderance of the credible evidence in the record.
NOTE: Findings below must be made only if the Respondent has clearly and specifically
raised all of them as issues. Whether they have been clearly and specifically raised is a decision
for the legal advisor.
LA:   1. The drug abuse is a departure from the Respondent‟s usual and customary behavior;
and
       2. The drug abuse occurred as the result of drug experimentation; and
       3. The drug abuse does not involve recurring incidents, except for drug experimentation;
       and
       4. The Respondent does not desire to engage in or intend to engage in drug abuse in the
       future; and
       5. The drug abuse under all the circumstances is unlikely to recur; and
       6. Under the particular circumstances of this case, the Respondent‟s continued presence
       in the Air Force is consistent with the Air Force‟s interest in proper discipline, good order,
       leadership and morale; and
NOTE: The legal advisor should give the following additional instruction here if the
Respondent is a noncommissioned officer.
LA: In this regard, you should take special note that noncommissioned officers have special
responsibilities by virtue of their status. They fulfill an integral role in maintaining discipline;
and, therefore, must exhibit high standards of personal integrity, loyalty, dedication, devotion to
duty and leadership.
7. Finally, the drug abuse did not involve drug distribution.
In making your determinations that retaining the Respondent is warranted under the seven
mitigating and extenuating circumstances that I have just outlined, you should remember that
 38                                                       AFPAM36-3210 1 NOVEMBER 1995


the burden of proof is on the Respondent. If the Respondent fails to prove any one of the seven
mitigating and extenuating factors above to your satisfaction, you may make the finding against
the Respondent.
LA: I will now summarize your options in this case:
   1. If you find that the Respondent did not do what is alleged in (the allegation) (any of the
      allegations), then you must recommend (his) (her) retention.
      2. If you find that the Respondent did what is alleged in (the) (any) drug abuse allegation,
         and if you make the additional finding that all of the extenuating and mitigating
         circumstances mentioned earlier are present in this case, then you may recommend the
         Respondent‟s retention.
[When the legal advisor determines that entry-level characterization is at issue, give the following
instruction.]
   3. If you find that the Respondent did what is alleged in (the) (any) drug abuse allegation,
      and you do not make the additional findings that all of the mitigation and extenuation
      factors were present, then if the Respondent is in entry- level status, and you determine
      that an under other than honorable conditions discharge is not appropriate, you must
      recommend an entry-level separation.
   4. If you find that the Respondent did what is alleged in (the) (any) drug abuse allegation,
      and you do not make the additional findings that all of the mitigation and extenuation
      factors were present and if the Respondent is not in entry-level status, then you must
      recommend discharge with an appropriate service characterization. Usually, discharges
      for drug abuse under paragraphs 5.54 should be an under other than honorable conditions
      discharge, unless the limitations on service characterization described in paragraphs
      1.21.3 and 1.21.4 apply. If you determine that an under other than honorable conditions
      discharge is not appropriate, then you must recommend discharge with either an
      honorable or general discharge. You may only recommend an honorable discharge
      if the Respondent‟s record has been so meritorious that any other characterization would
      be clearly inappropriate. If the basis for discharge includes both drug information which
      cannot be used for service characterization and other allegations, the Board must
      recommend an appropriate service characterization based on the other information
      independent of the drug abuse allegation. Again, you should consult AFI 36-3208,
      chapter 1, section B, for guidelines on service characterization.
   5. If you determine that discharge for drug abuse is appropriate, regardless of service
     characterization, you are instructed that you may not recommend the Respondent for
     probation and rehabilitation. AFI 36-3208, chapter 7 specifically prohibits probation and
     rehabilitation for airmen discharged for drug abuse.
LA: The findings and recommendations worksheet will help you sort out these options.
NOTES: If the Respondent has an appointment as a Reserve of the Air Force commissioned or
warrant officer, the Board must make a recommendation whether the Respondent should retain
the appointment. In such a case, the Legal Advisor should give appropriate instructions. See
AFI 36-3208, paragraph 8.11, before proceeding.
AFPAM36-3210 1 NOVEMBER 1995                                                                      39



Section H—-Discharge in the Interest of National Security

   The Respondent‟s commander, ———————————, has recommended that the
Respondent be discharged from the United States Air Force with (an Entry-Level Separation)(an
Honorable Discharge)(a General Discharge)(an Under Other Than Honorable Conditions
Discharge) under AFI 36-3208, chapter 5, section I, because retention of the Respondent would
be clearly inconsistent with the interest of national security. The basis for the recommendation is
set forth in paragraph 2 of the commander‟s notification letter to the Respondent, dated ———
—————————, which is Government Exhibit ————————.
LA:
You should become thoroughly familiar with that paragraph, because your first order of business
during deliberations will be to decide whether the (allegation)(allegations) (is)(are) true.
Specifically, the commander alleges the following: [Quote one or more allegations —————
———————————————————————————.]
You must address (the)(each) allegation squarely.          You must find (with respect to each
allegation) whether or not that allegation is true. If you find that none of the allegations is true,
then a recommendation for retention would naturally follow and should be made.
After you have made your findings, you must make one of the following recommendations: LA:
1. Retention in the Air Force.     Your recommendation for retention is binding on the
separation authority.   You should therefore deliberate fully on the effect that such a
recommendation will have both on the Respondent and the Air Force. Note, however, that you
may recommend retention even if you have found a reason for discharge under AFI 36-3208,
chapter 5, section I.
2. Entry-Level Separation. If you wish to recommend discharge, and have made a finding that
the Respondent is in entry- level status, then you must recommend an Entry-Level Separation.
3. Discharge with an Honorable or General Discharge. If you wish to recommend discharge,
and the Respondent is not in entry-level status, and an Under Other Than Honorable Conditions
Discharge is not appropriate, then you must recommend discharge with either an Honorable or
General Discharge. Consult AFI 36-3208, chapter 1, section B, for guidance in determining
which type of discharge would be appropriate.
4. Under Other Than Honorable Conditions Discharge. If the Respondent is not in entry-
level status, characterization of service as Under Other Than Honorable Conditions may be
appropriate if the Respondent‟s misconduct constitutes a significant departure from the
conduct expected of airmen. Consult AFI 36-3208, chapter 1, section B, for guidance in
determining whether this type of discharge is appropriate.
In reaching your findings and recommendations, you may consult the Respondent‟s entire
military record to the extent permitted by AFI 36-3208. Specifically, if you determine that the
Respondent‟s retention is contrary to the interest of national security, then the Respondent may
be discharged.
Airmen who have demonstrated that their retention is not in the interest of national security
should be discharged and their service appropriately characterized. If you recommend that the

Respondent be discharged, you must also recommend the type of service characterization. As I
explained earlier, your recommendation as to the type of service characterization in this case
depends both on whether or not the Respondent is in entry-level status, as well as upon the
guidelines set forth in AFI 36-3208, chapter 1, section B. In making your recommendations as
the type of service characterization, you may only consider Respondent‟s military record during
the current enlistment. You may not consider preservice or prior service misconduct, including
records of courts-martial convictions, records of nonjudicial punishment, or evidence of other
offenses.
NOTE: If the Respondent has an appointment as a Reserve of the Air Force commissioned or
warrant officer, the Board must make a recommendation whether the individual should retain the
appointment. In such a case, the Legal Advisor should give appropriate instructions. See AFI
36-3208, paragraph 8.11, before proceeding.

              INSTRUCTIONS ON PROBATION AND REHABILITATION

* NOTE: In all discharge cases except those processed under AFI 36-3208, chapter 5; section
C, paragraph 5.15 (fraudulent entry); section D, paragraph 5.22 (entry-level performance or
conduct); section H, paragraphs 5.53, (failure to comply with preventive HIV medicine
counseling) and 5.54 (drug abuse); or section I, paragraph 5.57 (national security), the Legal
Advisor gives the following instructions:
LA: If you recommend discharge, you must also recommend whether or not the Respondent
should receive rehabilitation with conditional suspension of the discharge under AFI 36-3208,
chapter 7. For convenience, I will refer to this concept as “probation and rehabilitation” or
“P&R.” In considering your recommendation on P&R, you should carefully consult AFI 36-
3208, chapter 7. Paragraph 7.1 covers the principles and objectives of the program, and
paragraphs 7.2 and 7.3 provide guidance with respect to policy and eligibility for the program.
I caution you that a recommendation that the Respondent be offered P&R is separate and distinct
from a recommendation for discharge. Before you may consider P&R, you must first have
decided to recommend discharge. Your later recommendation or P&R in no way impeaches the
discharge recommendation. You cannot recommend discharge contingent on approval of an
accompanying recommendation for P&R.
Your recommendation for or against P&R will be considered; however, your P&R
recommendation is not binding on the separation authority.
The Respondent‟s commander has (favorably)(not) recommended probation and rehabilitation.
You must independently determine whether or not to recommend P&R.
NOTE: In cases processed under AFI 36-3208, chapter 5, section C, paragraph 5.15 (fraudulent
entry); section D, paragraph 5.22 (entry-level performance or conduct); section H, paragraphs
5.53; (failure to comply with preventive HIV medicine counseling) and 5.54 (drug abuse); or
section I, paragraph 5.57 (National Security), the Legal Advisor instructs as follows:
LA:
In this case, your only recommendations will be whether or not to discharge the Respondent, and
if so, the type of discharge the Respondent should receive. The rehabilitation procedures with
conditional suspension of discharge (referred to as “probation and rehabilitation” or “P&R”)
under AFI 36-3208, chapter 7, are not available in this case. Neither your findings nor your
recommendations should mention probation, rehabilitation, or any related concept.
NOTE: After instructing on probation and rehabilitation, the Legal Advisor concludes his or her
closing instructions to the Board. (See chapter 3.)

(offense) (offenses) of                          of which you are suspected.
I advise you that under the provisions of Article 31, Uniform Code of Military Justice, you have
the right to remain silent, that is, to say nothing at all. Anything you do say may be used as
evidence against you in a trial by court-martial or in other judicial or administrative proceedings.
I advise you also that you have the right to consult with a lawyer, if you desire, and to have a
lawyer present during this questioning. You may obtain a civilian lawyer of your own choosing
at your own expense, or, if you wish, the Air Force will appoint a military lawyer for you free of
charge. You may request a lawyer at any time during your testimony, and if you decide to
answer questions without a lawyer present, you may stop the questioning at any time.
After advising the individual of his rights, the following questions should be asked to determine
that he understands his rights:
— Do you understand your rights?
— Do you wish to remain silent or will you answer my questions?
— Do you want a lawyer?

                               CHALLENGE PROCEDURES

A Respondent who wants to question the Legal Advisor or a voting member of the Board about
possible grounds for challenge, or to present evidence in support of a challenge, is permitted to
do so.Before making a challenge, the Respondent may address questions to the whole Board or
individual members to find out if there are grounds for a challenge for cause. The Respondent
may ask that an individual member be sworn in as a Board member before being questioned.
The Respondent may call witnesses or take the stand to testify under oath about the impartiality
of a member. A challenged member is permitted to make a statement about the challenge. The
President of the Board presides if the challenge is asserted against the Legal Advisor. A
challenge for cause may be asserted as follows:
RC:
The Respondent challenges ————————— for cause on the grounds ————————
—————————————————. (If witnesses for the Respondent, including the
Respondent, are called to testify regarding the competency of a Member, the oath or affirmation
below will be administered.)
REC:
(Addresses witness) You (swear)(affirm) that the evidence you are about to give shall be the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God. (Omit the final phrase if
affirmation is used.)
WIT:
I do.
REC:
State your name, grade, and organization.
WIT:                                         .
NOTES:
1. The questioning then proceeds to elicit the testimony of the witness as to the impartiality
of the Board member. The witness may be questioned by the Respondent, Respondent‟s
Counsel, Recorder, and Legal Advisor. The challenged member will take no part in the
hearings on the challenge except when called on to make a statement. When the presentation
of evidence in support of the challenge is completed, the challenged member will be given an
opportunity to make a statement. The challenged Member may be questioned by the
Respondent, Respondent‟s Counsel, Recorder, and Legal Advisor. The opposing counsel may
also call witnesses to testify regarding the challenge.    Such witnesses will be sworn as
previously indicated.
2. When all evidence on the challenge for cause has been introduced, arguments on the
challenge for cause may be made at a hearing without voting board members present.

LA: (After hearing evidence and argument on each challenge.)
The challenge (is)(is not) sustained. (The challenged Member is excused and will withdraw from
this hearing.)
NOTES:
1. The disqualified Member withdraws from the hearing and, if appropriate, the Board reseats
itself to the right and left of the President in order of seniority. If excusal of the Member results
in the retention of less than a quorum of voting members, or the lack of a Legal Advisor, or
fewer commissioned than noncommissioned officers, the Board will recess or adjourn and the
hearing will be delayed until the deficiency is remedied. If additional members are detailed to
the Board, counsel for each side will be afforded the opportunity to assert a challenge for cause
against them.
2. Challenges for cause against the Legal Advisor should be made in the presence of the voting
members. Each side shall be provided an opportunity to present evidence in support of such
challenge.
3. Following presentation of evidence and argument on the challenge to the Legal Advisor, the
Board shall meet in closed session, wherein the President shall announce his ruling on the
challenge. The President shall then poll the other voting members to see if they object to the
President‟s ruling, and unless a majority of the voting members object, the President‟s ruling
shall be final. The President shall announce the ruling in open session.
REC:
Let the record show that the challenged Member withdrew from the hearing room.
LA:
Does the Respondent desire to challenge any other voting member of the Board for cause? If not,
we will proceed.

                     SUPPLEMENTING THE NOTIFICATION LETTER

The addition of a new basic allegation to the existing notification letter should be accomplished
at any time during the Board proceedings when it becomes evident that such an addition is
appropriate.The normal procedure is for the Recorder, as the government‟s representative, to
make the request and present the proposed format for the additional allegation as an exhibit for
adoption. However, the Board, on its own motion, may initiate this action. The Board should
request the Recorder to prepare a draft allegation—see the suggested procedure below.
LA:
It has become apparent that consideration should be given to the addition of a new basic
allegation to the notification letter because of evidence presented or offered at this proceeding.
The Recorder has been requested to draft the proposed additional allegation as Government
Exhibit —————— and has completed that task.
REC:
At this time the Recorder moves that the Board amend the notification letter to include an
 additional allegation. The evidence heretofore presented (or offered) to this Board tends to
 substantiate                                 .   In support of this motion I offer as
 Government Exhibit                            a   sample additional allegation which
 incorporates the allegation outlined above.
LA:
The Recorder‟s motion is (granted)(denied). Government Exhibit (is)(is not) so amended.
NOTE: If the notification letter is amended, the Legal Advisor will advise the Respondent as
follows:
LA:
The Letter of Notification has been amended by adding the following (allegation)(allegations)
(————————). You are entitled to a delay for a reasonable period of time to prepare
your defense to this additional allegation. Please consult with your counsel and state your
desires.
RC:
(Respondent is prepared to proceed at this time and waives further delay with respect to
the additional allegation.) (Respondent requests delay for preparation of the defense.) (State
period of time.)
LA:
(Respondent may present evidence           on the additional      allegation)   or   (The   Board
will (adjourn) (recess) until                , 19 .)
LA:
The Board is open.

REC:
Let the record reflect that the Board adjourned at               , 19 , and that all parties
who were present when the Board (adjourned)(recessed) are again present.
LA:
Is the Respondent prepared to present (his)(her) defense to the additional Statement of Reasons?
RC:
Respondent is prepared to proceed.
(Testimony will be introduced by each side in accordance with normal procedures.)

1. The Respondent may not be discharged for fraudulent entry unless the board finds that
the (misrepresentation)(com- mission)(concealment) was deliberate and that it concerned a
material fact.
2. If the Respondent is alleged to have concealed a civil court conviction, the board must find
whether or not the Respondent received a sentence which included confinement for 6 months or
more, without regard to suspension or probation, or that a similar offense under the MCM
authorizes a punitive discharge.
NOTE: Eliminate from worksheet if not in issue.

                                          RECOMMENDATIONS

                      SAMPLE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

                                             DRUG ABUSE

This board, after carefully considering all the evidence in this case, has, in closed session, by
secret written ballot a majority of the voting members concurring, made the following findings
and recommendations:

                                                 FINDINGS

a. The Respondent. (List allegation(s) in notification (letter)(letters).)
   (1) (did)(did not) (list first allegation).
   (2) (did)(did not) (list second allegation).
   (3) (list any other allegations).
b. The Respondent (is)(is not) in entry-level status. (Eliminate from worksheet if not an issue.)

NOTE: No other findings are required; however, if the Board finds that the Respondent
committed one or more of the alleged incidents, then the Board may make the further findings
described below. (Eliminate from worksheet if not an issue.)
c. If you find the Respondent has committed a drug offense, and if the Respondent has asserted
that (s)he meets the requirements of AFI 36-3208, paragraph 5.55.2.1, or if the board itself
finds (s)he does, then the board will make the following findings:
    1. Drug abuse (is) (is not) a departure from the Respondent‟s usual and customary behavior
    2. Drug abuse (did)(did not) occur as the result of drug experimentation
    3. Drug abuse (does)(does not) involve recurring incidents, other than experimentation
    4. The Respondent (does)(does not) desire or intend to engage in drug abuse in the future
      5. The board (does)(does not) believe that under all the circumstances of this case, the
         Respondent‟s drug abuse will likely recur.
    6. Under the particular circumstances of the case, the Respondent‟s continued presence in
       the Air Force (is)(is not) consistent with the interest of the Air Force in maintaining
       proper discipline, good order, leadership and morale.
    7. The drug abuse (did)(did not) involve drug distribution as defined in AFI 36-3208,
       paragraph 5.55.2.1

                                                 RECOMMENDATIONS:

( Indicate one choice; if choice 3 is selected, circle type of discharge)
1. Since it has not been shown by a preponderance of the evidence that a drug offense
has been committed by the Respondent, (s)he should be retained in the United States Air Force.
AFPAM36-3210 1 NOVEMBER 1995                                                                 65


2. Despite Respondent‟s involvement with illegal drugs, (s)he meets all seven retention criteria
set out in AFI 36-3208, para 5.55.2.1, as we noted in our Findings. The Respondent should,
therefore, be retained in the United States Air Force.
3. Respondent should be discharged from the United States Air Force with (an Entry Level) (an
Honorable) ( a General) (an Under Other Than Honorable Conditions) discharge.
The undersigned certify that a majority of the voting members concur in the above findings and
recommendations.
