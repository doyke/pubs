SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction was revised to include reference and organization changes. The changes include
changing publication number to conform to the AFPD and AFI numbering. Changes within this
publication comply with changes to Air Force and local airfield operations; updating of all office
symbols and phone numbers; changing all references from ―Serco‖ to ―30 OSS/OSAB;‖ and ―all
agencies transporting hazardous materials via the airfield will coordinate as required (paragraph
1.6.)‖.
1. Responsibilities:
     1.1. Any organization owning or having operational control of hazardous materials being
     transported via the airfield will:
     1.2. Develop checklists, plans, and processes to ensure compliance with this and other
     appropriate regulatory guidance. 30th Operations Support Squadron, Airfield Management
     Operations (30 OSS/OSAA) will be a coordinating agency in the development of these plans.
     1.3. Provide an on-scene supervisor designated by the unit commander or project manager,
     who is responsible for pre-mission coordination, on-load or off-load operations,
     transportation and handling of hazardous materials for which the unit or agency is
     responsible. If the nature or classification of the shipment is such that the full nature of the
     cargo cannot be disclosed to supporting agencies, the on-scene supervisor must be available
     at the airfield at all times during the following time frame: inbound shipment - 30 minutes
     before aircraft estimated time of arrival until cargo is safely in storage, outbound - 15
     minutes prior to cargo arrival on the airfield.
     1.4. Coordinate extension of airfield operating hours as necessary to support inbound or
     outbound shipments of hazardous cargo. The published airfield operating hours are Monday
     through Friday, 0800 to 1700 hours local; closed weekends, federal holidays and AFSPC
     Family days. See Section 5, Airfield Procedures, for after-hours airfield support procedures.
     1.5. Schedule and conduct a pre-mission briefing for all Class 1 through Class 3 cargo. For
     multiple shipments moving identical hazardous cargo, notify the following agencies prior to
     each shipment. After the initial briefing, a single location briefing is not required for each
     sequential move.
NOTE: The preferred briefing location is one that is centralized and secured for classified
briefings.
        1.5.1. 30th Civil Engineer Squadron, Fire Protection Flight (30 CES/CEF).
        1.5.2. 30th Civil Engineer Squadron, Readiness and Emergency Management Flight (30

2. Hazardous Cargo Types: Use this instruction when transporting the following materials by
surface: Nuclear weapons, Department of Transportation (DoT) Class 6 and 8 poisons,
etiological materials, biological research materials, Department of Defense (DOD) hazard class
or division 1.1 through 1.4 explosives and blasting agents. In addition, this instruction applies to
 6                                                               30SWI13-202 25 January 2012


radioactive materials that require Yellow III labels, inert devices, irritating materials, compressed
gases, flammable solids, flammable liquids, Class B poisons and corrosives listed in AFMAN
24-204 (I), Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments, when these items are
shipped in quantities of 1,000 pounds or more (gross weight). This does not include explosives
or other hazardous materials that are integral parts of the aircraft and its systems.
3. Notification:
     3.1. Initial notification of an inbound or outbound aerial shipment of hazardous cargo as
     defined herein will be coordinated using a staff summary sheet or other appropriate method
     as deemed necessary by the scope and classification of the shipment. In all cases, initial
     notification must be completed by 1600 hours local the duty day prior to the shipment.
     3.2. Any changes in shipment, itinerary or mission must be disseminated to support agencies
     as the information becomes available. During normal duty hours (0700-1700), contact 30
     OSS/OSAA at DSN 276-6941 with changes. After normal duty hours, contact the 30 SW/CP
     at DSN 276-9961. These agencies will further disseminate the information as necessary.
     3.3. Aircraft commanders for inbound missions carrying hazardous cargo must contact 30
     OSS/OSAA on Pilot to Dispatch 372.2 MHz or 30 SW/CP (311.0 or 321.0 MHz) by radio,
     30 minutes before arrival, to relay pertinent mission data. The agency receiving the
     information starts arrival notification using applicable checklists.
     3.4. 30 OSS/OSAA and 30 SW/CP will notify appropriate agencies of any outbound
     shipment of hazardous cargo once the aircraft is airborne.
4. Security Concerns for Classified Cargo:
     4.1. Operations and communications security procedures consistent with the classification of
     the mission information will be followed during the notification process.
     4.2. To lessen security concerns, including the verification of security clearance for persons
     attending a classified briefing, mission information released during the notification or
     coordination process should be limited to unclassified material to the maximum extent
     possible consistent with the purpose of this instruction. However, if this is not possible, the
     agency conducting the briefing will ensure all personnel attending are properly cleared. In
     addition, the agency conducting the briefing will ensure the proper security is established at
     the briefing location to prevent OPSEC and COMSEC compromise.
     4.3. Direct any questions concerning handling or disseminating classified information to the
     appropriate unit security manager or 30th Space Wing Information Protection (30 SW/IP)
     office (606-0755).
5. Airfield Procedures.
     5.1. Local procedures governing airfield operations are covered in 30 SWI 13-201,
     Vandenberg AFB Airfield Operations and 30 SWI 13-204, Airfield Driving. The following is
     a brief summary of information in these instruction related to aerial shipment of hazardous
     cargo. For more detailed information, consult the appropriate instruction.
     5.2. The airfield has published operating hours. Any proposed operation that could or will
     cause extension of these hours must be coordinated with 30 OSS/OSA as early in the
     planning phase as possible. The 30 OG/CC is the authority for extension of operating hours.
30SWI13-202 25 January 2012                                                                   7


   Such operations may require reimbursement for overtime payment for contracted services.
   Failure to comply may result in nonsupport or cancellation of the mission.
   5.3. Any vehicle operations on the airfield, including convoys carrying hazardous cargo, will
   be conducted IAW 30 SWI 13-204.
   5.4. The airfield has three approved parking locations for aircraft carrying hazardous cargo
   (see Attachment 3). Hazardous Cargo Parking (HCP) 1 is sited for 100,000 pounds of H/D
   1.1, HCP2 is sited for 78K of H/D 1.1 and HCP3 is site for 70K of H/D 1.3 and MEQ 1.4.
   These spots are located to allow simultaneous hazardous operations, if required. While these
   parking spots were developed using explosive quantity-distance criteria, they will generally
   be used to park aircraft carrying DoT Class 6 and 8 explosives and poisons, regardless of
   quantity. Exceptions may be granted based on the specific characteristics of the cargo
   thereby allowing the aircraft involved to be parked elsewhere on the airfield. Requests for
   exception must be pre-coordinated with 30 OSS/OSAA, 30 SW/SE and other agencies as
   dictated by the nature of the request and the cargo.
   5.5. There are two convoy form-up areas in the vicinity of the airfield (see Attachment 3).
   Either form-up area may be used depending on the nature of the operation.
   5.6. There are two explosive transportation routes available to move hazardous cargo to and
   from the flight line hazardous cargo parking spots (see Attachment 3).
      5.6.1. The supervisor of any convoy requiring movement across the approach end of
      runway 30 must pre-coordinate this requirement with 30 OSS/OSAA 24 hours in
      advance. This is necessary to ensure proper escort is provided or the convoy supervisor
      is qualified and has the necessary radio capability to obtain the appropriate clearances
      from the tower for movement in the Controlled Movement Area (CMA).
