     2.4.2.7. (Added-AFISRA) Provide meaningful feedback to commanders from a broad
     viewpoint as well as the specific evaluation of the existing inspection criteria. The unit
     operation will be evaluated covering the entire period stemming from the last formal
     visit, not just a ―snapshot‖ of the unit’s current program status.
     2.4.2.8. (Added-AFISRA) SEV Notification Procedures:
        2.4.2.8.1. (Added-AFISRA) HQ AFISRA Stan/Eval will send a formal notification
        message/memorandum to the unit with an info copy the parent HHQ, as applicable,
        60 days before the visit. For ARC visits, notification will be sent to the units, the
        State Adjutant General and NGB/A2, as applicable. The intent of this
        message/memorandum is to confirm the dates of the visit and inform the unit of the
        scope of the evaluation and support requirements. As a minimum, the
        message/memorandum will include the following:
            2.4.2.8.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) Approximate number of team members.
            2.4.2.8.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) Planned arrival date.

            of Stan/Eval and/or Senior Evaluators.
        2.4.2.8.2. (Added-AFISRA) Thirty days prior to the inspection, HQ AFISRA
        Stan/Eval will send a follow-up message/memorandum which will include name,
        rank, security clearance, restricted area badge number (as applicable), and mission
        area specialty of each team member.
     2.4.2.9. (Added-AFISRA) Pre-visit Procedures. Pre-visits normally will be conducted
     2-6 months prior to the formal SEV to allow sufficient time to satisfy the requirements of
     the SEV. The purpose of pre-visit is to focus on evaluations and evaluation profiles.
     There is no formal in-brief or out-brief associated with a pre-visit. The AFISRA
     Stan/Eval visit coordinator (VC), in coordination with the AFISRA Chief of Stan/Eval,
     will use the letter of certifications (letter of Xs) to determine the number of evaluations to
     be accomplished and the personnel to be evaluated. The AFISRA VC will coordinate
     with the unit stan/eval on evaluation requirements and schedule. Each AFISRA Stan/Eval
     evaluator will record all evaluation results on the applicable evaluation log. The unit
     stan/eval is responsible for reviewing and ensuring the accuracy of the evaluation logs
12                                   AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010


     and giving daily evaluation updates to the VC as soon as possible. Upon completion of
     the pre-visit, a HHQ evaluator will report the results to the VC to update the formal SEV
     checklist. The results of the pre-visit will also be debriefed to the AFISRA, Chief of
     Stan/Eval. All remaining evaluations required to meet formal inspection requirements
     and any additional evaluations, as deemed necessary by AFISRA Stan/Eval can be
     completed by another pre-visit, by deputized HHQ evaluators or during the formal SEV.
     2.4.2.10. (Added-AFISRA) Formal SEV support requirements:
        2.4.2.10.1. (Added-AFISRA) A private work center large enough to accommodate

        supplemented.
     2.4.2.12. (Added-AFISRA) Conduct of Visits:
        2.4.2.12.1. (Added-AFISRA) "Overall Unit Rating" is determined by combining the
        group Stan/Eval and squadron ratings. The group Stan/Eval rating is based on
        compliance with paragraph 3.2 and group/squadron-assigned evaluators during
        objectivity evaluations administered by the HHQ team. Squadron ratings, when
        applicable, are based on compliance with paragraph 3.3, and the performance of
        assigned/attached intelligence personnel during mission evaluations.
            2.4.2.12.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) The overall unit rating will not be higher than
            Satisfactory if the overall unit program rating is Unsatisfactory.
            2.4.2.12.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) The overall unit program grade will not be
            higher than Satisfactory if any unit program is rated Unsatisfactory.
        2.4.2.12.2. (Added-AFISRA) Intelligence        personnel     performance        during
        evaluations and closed book testing will comprise 50 percent of unit rating. Stan/Eval
        programs, procedures and compliance will comprise the other 50 percent. HHQ
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                   13


       teams will comment on unit supervision and will identify Limiting Factors
       (LIMFACs) noted for higher headquarters action that adversely affect the unit's
       mission accomplishment. If appropriate, HHQ teams may comment on a distinct level
       of supervision within the unit.
       2.4.2.12.3. (Added-AFISRA) Stan/Eval programs, to include IE Objectivity
       Evaluations and group/squadron Operations Supervision will receive a 5-tier rating.
          2.4.2.12.3.1. (Added-AFISRA) OUTSTANDING. Performance and procedures
          in effect were error-free and far exceeded all requirements. Program serves as a
          model which others should emulate.
          2.4.2.12.3.2. (Added-AFISRA) EXCELLENT. Performance and procedures in
          effect exceeded requirements and enhanced overall effectiveness.
          2.4.2.12.3.3. (Added-AFISRA) SATISFACTORY.            Performance        and/or
          operations met mission requirements. Procedures and activities were carried out
          in an effective and competent manner. Resources and programs were efficiently
          managed. Minor deficiencies existed but do not impede or limit mission
          accomplishment.
          2.4.2.12.3.4. (Added-AFISRA) MARGINAL. Most requirements were met, but
          not in full compliance with directives. Performance and the effectiveness of the
          program were degraded by deviations from procedures.
          2.4.2.12.3.5. (Added-AFISRA) UNSATISFACTORY. Deviations or omissions
          caused the program(s) evaluated to be non-effective. Little compliance with
          appropriate directives was evident.
       2.4.2.12.4. (Added-AFISRA) Intelligence-Related Special Interest Items (SIIs). SIIs
       are established to focus attention on operations related areas and will be evaluated
       during formal visits. Compliance will be reflected in all ratings and evaluations, and
       will be commented on separately in formal visit reports.
       2.4.2.12.5. (Added-AFISRA) Intelligence personnel performance will consist of a
       representative sample (paragraph 2.4.2.9) of supervisors, instructors, and line
       intelligence personnel. The goal is to administer qualification evaluations to at least
       10 percent of unit intelligence personnel and IE objectivity evaluations to all
       intelligence evaluators. Individuals maintaining multiple qualifications may be
       evaluated in any current qualification. The AFISRA Chief of Stan/Eval will
       determine the final number of evaluations.
          2.4.2.12.5.1. (Added-AFISRA) Individuals and/or crews identified to be
          evaluated in the notification messages will, to the maximum extent possible, have
          all evaluation requisites, except those directed by the inspection team, completed
          prior to the formal visit to facilitate completion of the AF Forms 4350, Certificate
          of Intelligence Qualification, prior to departure of the inspection team.
          2.4.2.12.5.2. (Added-AFISRA) Evaluations administered by a unit intelligence
          evaluator where a HHQ intelligence evaluator will observe and administer an IE
          Objectivity Evaluation will primarily be conducted on full notice qualification
          evaluations. The full evaluation profile should be planned by the objectivity
14                                AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010


        evaluatee (unit IE). These evaluations will constitute an evaluation of the
        examinee (conducted by the unit IE), as well as the unit intelligence evaluator’s
        objectivity and the unit's evaluation profiles (conducted by the HHQ IE).
        2.4.2.12.5.3. (Added-AFISRA) No-notice evaluations will be administered to
        individuals by notifying the unit at an appropriate time (if the individual is already
        on the schedule) or by requesting that an individual be added to the next day's
        schedule for this purpose. Any additional or unique HHQ IE evaluation
        requirements, beyond the scheduled mission profile, will be communicated to the
        examinee no later than 24 hours prior to the designated crew briefing to facilitate
        mission planning.
        2.4.2.12.5.4. (Added-AFISRA) Evaluations administered by HHQ intelligence
        evaluators (including inspection team designated deputies) within 6 months of a
        formal Stan/Eval visit will be counted toward the evaluation sample for that visit.
        2.4.2.12.5.5. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA Stan/Eval Deputized Evaluators.
        When necessary, AFISRA Stan/Eval will use deputized external evaluators from
        other units to assist in completing required evaluations. Deputized external
        evaluators may give IE objectivity and qualification (e.g., QUAL and MSN)
        evaluations. As a last resort, unit evaluators can be deputized at AFISRA
        Stan/Eval’s discretion. Deputized evaluators should be the most experienced
        evaluators in their respective position and have received a successful objectivity
        evaluation from an AFISRA Stan/Eval evaluator during a pre-visit. Deputized
        evaluators should primarily be used for qualification evaluations.
        2.4.2.12.5.6. (Added-AFISRA) Deputized evaluators will be recommended by
        the VC and designated by the AFISRA Chief of Stan/Eval. Before conducting
        evaluations deputized evaluators will be in-briefed and placed on AFISRA
        Stan/Eval evaluator orders. For the purpose of the inspection, deputized
        evaluators are considered AFISRA evaluators.
        2.4.2.12.5.7. (Added-AFISRA) External and local deputies will report any
        evaluations given directly to unit Stan/Eval as soon as possible. Unit Stan/Eval
        will keep the VC updated on the progress of all evaluation requirements.
        Evaluation results and any issues or concerns should be discussed with AFISRA
        Stan/Eval. The VC will determine when deputized evaluators are no longer
        responsible to AFISRA Stan/Eval for evaluation requirements. Upon completion
        of requirements, the VC will inform the unit’s Chief of Stan/Eval that deputized
        evaluators are removed from AFISRA evaluator orders.
     2.4.2.12.6. (Added-AFISRA) In addition to individual evaluations, all available
     MR/CMR/BMC individuals will be administered a minimum 25 question closed book
     written examination. Individuals enrolled in a formal training program (other than
     instructor upgrade) are exempt. Alibis must be forwarded to the VC for approval.
     Members holding multiple qualifications may be tested in any qualification held.
        2.4.2.12.6.1. (Added-AFISRA) The written examination will consist of
        questions from the specific MDS, weapon system or intelligence function and
        activity duty position MQF. The inspection team may substitute 10% of questions
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                     15


              with non-MQF questions developed by the inspection team. These questions, if
              used, will reflect local procedures, IRFs, and SIIs. If non-MQF questions are
              used, topics will be identified in the 60-day message.
                 2.4.2.12.6.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) The written examination administered
                 during a Stan/Eval formal inspection may fulfill either the requisite closed-
                 book examination requirement, if it meets all the appropriate criteria, or the
                 semi-annual test requirement at the discretion of the unit commander. This
                 determination will apply to all personnel assigned to the unit.
                 2.4.2.12.6.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) Examination         construction.       The
                 examinations will be constructed by unit Stan/Eval in accordance with the
                 unit’s governing directives and will be forwarded to AFISRA Stan/Eval no
                 later than two weeks prior to the beginning of the formal inspection. The
                 construction of the written examination will be approved by the AFISRA
                 Chief of Stan/Eval. Unit Stan/Eval will provide AFISRA Stan/Eval with two
                 versions of an examination for each specialty. Any changes to this timeline
                 will be coordinated between the VC and unit Stan/Eval.
              2.4.2.12.6.2. (Added-AFISRA) The minimum passing grade for the written
              examination is 85%.
              2.4.2.12.6.3. (Added-AFISRA) The unit’s rating for testing will be determined
              using the grading scale in Table 2.1. Any individual who fails the examination
              will be given adequate time (24-48 hours) to review the material and retest. An
              alternate version of the exam will be used for retesting purposes.

          2.4.2.12.7. (Added-AFISRA) Programs. All programs will be evaluated in
          accordance with governing directives. In addition to the programs identified in Table
          2.2 (Added) of this supplement, any HQ AFISRA/CC area of emphasis may also be
          evaluated. These areas will be coordinated between the VC and the affected unit. All
          program managers or alternates will be available for interviews throughout the formal
          inspection regardless of the coordinated schedule. All evaluation (and training, where
          applicable) folders need to be placed in a container and left in the teamwork center
          for the duration of the inspection. The unit Stan/Eval will provide the SEV Team
          Chief with an inventory of all folders delivered. A SEV team member will verify the
          inventory and sign for the folders. All continuity books and associated reference
          material and products should be available for review. After the initial interview with
          each program manager, the evaluator may come back during the week to ask more
 16                                      AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010


           questions, or to review more material. Once the evaluator has completed his
           inspection, they will validate the results with the program manager. No grades will be
           given, but weak areas and strong points will be discussed. Special Interest Items will
           be rated as either compliant or non-compliant.

              commander/staff.
              2.4.2.12.8.2. (Added-AFISRA) Plan the number and types of evaluations to be
              conducted as well as identify which individuals will be evaluated.
           2.4.2.12.9. (Added-AFISRA) Post-visit Responsibilities:
              2.4.2.12.9.1. (Added-AFISRA) Provide the unit Chief of Stan/Eval completed
              AF Forms 4350 for the evaluations given by the team members during the visit.
              AF Forms 4350 will be created using the approved unit program/database, when
              possible. Unit stan/eval function will assist HHQ evaluators as needed to
              facilitate.
              2.4.2.12.9.2. (Added-AFISRA) Write and distribute copies of the formal report
              to the appropriate command levels and respective Stan/Eval sections NLT 60 days
              after completion of the visit. Normally a draft report will be left with the unit prior
              to the team's departure.
              2.4.2.12.9.3. (Added-AFISRA) Reporting formal SEV results will be in
              accordance with Figure 2.1 (Added) of this supplement.
                  2.4.2.12.9.3.1. (Added-AFISRA) Findings. All findings identified in the
                  report must reference a specific publication/directive and/or written procedure
                  and require corrective action by the unit. The AFISRA Stan/Eval function is
                  the focal point and final arbiter of the corrective action required of the unit.
                  The MAJCOM Commander is the final arbiter of any corrective action
                  required of the MAJCOM. The unit will formally report finding disposition to
                  AFISRA Stan/Eval NLT 60 days from receipt of the formal visit report. If not
                  closed within the 60 day period, findings will continue to be reported in
                  subsequent SEBs, at a minimum, until closed. AFISRA Stan/Eval may
                  require more frequent updates on corrective actions by the unit as determined
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                     17


                  by the AFISRA Chief of Stan/Eval.
                  2.4.2.12.9.3.2. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA Stan/Eval will provide feedback
                  on open and closed items. Feedback will be forwarded to the affected unit
                  normally within 90 days of receipt of SEB minutes. AFISRA Stan/Eval
                  feedback will include findings, status (open/closed), and the details that
                  affected the status of a finding. Additionally, AFISRA Stan/Eval may request
                  additional information or documents in order to resolve and close items.
                  2.4.2.12.9.3.3. (Added-AFISRA) Recommendations. Methods or procedures
                  which the team believes will enhance the unit program/items.

                  report superior programs/items identified during the formal SEV.
       2.4.2.13. (Added-AFISRA) Revisits:
           2.4.2.13.1. (Added-AFISRA) A supplemental visit will be made as soon as practical
           after an incomplete SEV.
           2.4.2.13.2. (Added-AFISRA) Units receiving an overall UNSATISFACTORY
           rating will be scheduled for a follow-up SEV. Follow-up SEVs will normally be
           accomplished NLT 6 months after the original SEV.
           2.4.2.13.3. (Added-AFISRA) A 30-day notification memorandum/message will be
           sent prior to revisits in accordance with paragraph 2.4.2.8.1 (Added) of this
           supplement.
           2.4.2.13.4. (Added-AFISRA) Reports from revisits will be addenda to the initial
           visit report and will follow the format in Figure 2.1 (Added) of this supplement.

       2.4.2.14. (Added-AFISRA) Members of other units may observe a formal inspection
       with the approval of the host WG or GP/CC, as well as AFISRA Stan/Eval. They are not
       involved in the grading of any ground programs or mission debriefs, will not participate
       in graded unit functions and will not attend team meetings. They are there on a not-to-
       interfere basis, and must coordinate activities with the VC. The visited unit will ensure
       observers are distinguishable from unit personnel (i.e. Observer Badge).
20                                    AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010


     2.4.2.15. (Added-AFISRA) During the course of formal inspections, AFISRA
     Stan/Eval will take note of exceptional performance by unit personnel. These individuals
     will be recognized as ―Superior Performers‖ and will be requested to attend the out-brief.
  2.4.3. Staff Assistance Visits.
     2.4.3.1. HHQ Intelligence Stan/Eval may conduct SAVs to solve specific Intelligence
     Stan/Eval related problems or exchange information. SAVs may cover any Intelligence
     Stan/Eval related area the unit desires.
     2.4.3.1. (AFISRA) (N/A AFRC) AFISRA Stan/Eval will normally conduct a scheduled
     Midterm SEV Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) at the approximate half-way point between
     formal SEVs. Confirmation notification of the SAV will be sent to the unit approximately
     45-60 days prior. SAVs may include any stan/eval or training related area the unit
     requests.
         2.4.3.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) SAVs prepare units for a formal SEV, solve specific
         problems, and generate information exchange between units. All SAVs are scheduled
         by the AFISRA Stan/Eval VC in coordination with the unit Stan/Eval, unit
         Commander, and parent organization and approved by the AFISRA Stan/Eval
         Division Chief. SAVs are recommended but not mandatory and are conducted at unit
         request with sufficient advance HHQ coordination. Team composition for a SAV
         will vary according to visit objectives. The team will consist of a Team Chief, VC,
         and additional personnel to inspect ground programs. SAVs can also cover any other
         stan/eval-related area the unit desires. AFISRA Stan/Eval will make every effort to
         conduct SAVs NLT 12 months prior to a unit’s formal SEV. Units should submit
         SAV requests to AFISRA Stan/Eval at least 18 months prior to a formal SEV to allow
         for scheduling, HHQ deconfliction, coordination and planning. Requests beyond the
         18 month window cannot be guaranteed but will be considered on a case by case
         basis.
         2.4.3.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) Staff Assistance Visit Procedures. The purpose of the
         SAV is to provide assistance to the unit. The VC will confirm with unit Stan/Eval the
         time and place for an informal in-brief and should be in a room that seats all required
         attendees. Following the AFISRA Stan/Eval Team Chief’s brief, the host unit may
         make a short presentation on the unit’s mission, DOC statement, capabilities, limiting
         factors, and any related local procedures. The SAV team will review programs in
         accordance with governing directives, utilizing AFISRA Stan/Eval checklists
         (available on the AFISRA Stan/Eval CoP). The SAV team will provide unit Stan/Eval
         an overview of each unit program. The team will identify any problem areas with
         recommended corrective action(s) in a report for the unit. The AFISRA Stan/Eval
         Chief will review the report upon return from the trip and update the AFISRA/A3 on
         the unit’s status.
         2.4.3.1.3. (Added-AFISRA) Reports generated by a SAV will be informal (internal
         use only).
     2.4.3.2. Units may request a MAJCOM or NAF SAV when deemed necessary by the
     SIO or unit commander.
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                     21


  2.4.4. (Added-AFISRA) Informal visits facilitate information exchange and feedback
  regarding training and stan/eval programs, and provide proficiency and currency
  opportunities for attached HHQ Stan/Eval personnel. These visits will be coordinated with
  the unit scheduler, unit Stan/Eval and the unit Commander, unless other procedures are
  established.
     2.4.4.1. (Added-AFISRA) HHQ Evaluators Informal Visit Procedures. Each unit
     Stan/Eval will track evaluation requirements for intelligence personnel positions that are
     represented at AFISRA Stan/Eval, as required, and coordinate with AFISRA Stan/Eval to
     conduct the evaluation within the eligibility zone. Evaluators should vary monthly visits
     among their specific units. AFISRA Stan/Eval intelligence members maintaining a
     qualification in an AFISRA intelligence position will maintain proficiency, accomplish
     Ready Intelligence Program (RIP) requirements, and conduct informal visits with the
     applicable units.
  2.4.5. (Added-AFISRA) Limited Notice Inspections. AFISRA/A3, AFRC/A2, or NGB/A2
  may direct limited notice inspections of subordinate units. The directing authority will
  determine the scope and direction of this inspection, select the team chief, and will consult
  appropriate unit leadership preceding the arrival of the evaluation team. Normally unit
  leadership will be notified at least 48 hours prior to any limited notice inspection. The team
  chief will report to the unit commander upon arrival and present the evaluation plan for
  coordination.

                                            Chapter 3

       UNIT INTELLIGENCE STAN/EVAL FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION

3.1. Scope. This chapter applies to organizations below MAJCOM level.                         Each
unit/organization with an Air Force intelligence mission is required to establish an Intelligence
Stan/Eval function for the purposes of this instruction. The SIO is responsible to assign
personnel to the Intelligence Stan/Eval function full-time, as an additional duty or a mixture of
both. The scope, diversity of duties and number of personnel assigned to the unit will dictate the
number of evaluators required. The Intelligence Stan/Eval function should be located at the
highest echelon possible (e.g., for the flying wing, the Intelligence Stan/Eval function will be at
the OSS/OSF IN level).
3.1. (AFISRA) Note: ―Unit,‖ as used here and throughout this instruction, is a level of
organization under HHQs required to establish a Stan/Eval function. Most AFISRA units are
composed of an Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Group (GP) and intelligence

       4.3.2.8. (Added-AFISRA) Immediately correct breaches of mission or system
       safety/discipline during an evaluation (this applies to all intelligence personnel). If this
       situation occurs, the intelligence evaluator will also debrief an appropriate unit supervisor
       and if appropriate document the deviation on an AF Form 4350.
       4.3.2.9. (Added-AFISRA) Reporting Deviations by Like/Unlike Specialty: Evaluators,
       conducting evaluations or performing IE, instructor, or intelligence personnel duties must
       report intelligence personnel (within their mission area regardless of the individual's duty
       specialty) not receiving an evaluation who commit significant deviations from established
       procedures/ directives to the unit Stan/Eval chief and unit supervision for necessary
       action. If the commander determines the deviation(s) warrant a downgrade or an overall
       Qualification Level 3, document the deviation(s) on an AF Form 4350 IAW paragraph
       7.5 (Added).
       4.3.2.10. (Added-AFISRA) For integrated units, cross-component evaluations are
       approved and will be coordinated between the host unit and the associate unit IAW their
       MOU (see AFPD10-3).
       4.3.2.11. (Added-AFISRA) Normally, intelligence evaluators will not evaluate
       personnel they have primarily instructed or recommended for upgrade.
4.4. (Added-AFISRA) Senior Intelligence Evaluator Program (Optional).
   4.4.1. (Added-AFISRA) Group commanders may maintain Intelligence Evaluator status
   from a previously qualified intelligence duty position. Vice commanders and deputies may
   perform this function if the principal incumbent is not qualified or available.
   4.4.2. (Added-AFISRA) Group commanders and group deputy-commanders do not
   require, nor do they have to maintain, instructor qualification or MR/CMR status. To become
   an evaluator, group commanders, and applicable group deputy-commanders, must maintain
   at least BMC status and be Intelligence Evaluator certified. For other than SPOT evaluations,
   Senior evaluators will evaluate only events for which they are current and at a level for which
   they are qualified.
   4.4.3. (Added-AFISRA) Senior evaluators will not perform instructor duties unless
   instructor qualified. Senior evaluators will not conduct initial or requalification instructor
   evaluations unless instructor qualified. Senior Intelligence Evaluator upgrade and
   documentation will be outlined in the unit supplement of the unit to which they are attached
   for qualification.
4.5. (Added-AFISRA) Intelligence duty positions that do not require a mission performance or
task phase evaluation do not require Intelligence Evaluators.

                                        EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Intelligence Stan/Eval Program utilizes qualification evaluations to ensure
certification of intelligence personnel and standardization of intelligence operations. Intelligence
qualification evaluations are administered periodically and documented on the AF Form 4350.
Certification of core tasks of specialty training standard (STS) may be accomplished
concurrently with intelligence evaluations.
   5.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) Supplementary evaluations are utilized to ensure qualification of
   intelligence personnel and standardization of operations. Supplementary evaluations are
   unstructured tools to be used by the commander to ensure standardization of missions and
   other operations.
   5.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPEs) may be used as
   requisites for some intelligence personnel crewmember qualification evaluations as specified
   in the AFI 14-2(MDS)v2.
5.2. Intelligence Qualification Evaluations. Intelligence qualification evaluations consist of
two structured phases, knowledge and task. Each phase requires the completion of requisite
events. The knowledge phase includes a series of written (and/or oral, if applicable)
examinations. The task phase includes a hands-on evaluation of intelligence performance.
5.2. (AFISRA) The knowledge phase evaluates intelligence personnel knowledge of the duty
position and applicable procedures. The task (mission performance) phase includes a
demonstrated task or event check conducted during a live mission or, if applicable, under
simulated conditions (see paragraphs 5.2.5 and 5.2.5.1 (Added)). AFISRA intelligence
personnel must satisfy the evaluation task criteria and demonstrate an ability to operate
applicable equipment/systems safely and effectively during all phases of an evaluation to receive
a qualified grade on an evaluation. The knowledge phase for intelligence personnel evaluations
includes requisites listed in paragraph 5.2.1.1 See Chapter 6 of this instruction for additional
guidance on intelligence personnel examinations.
   5.2.1. Intelligence Qualification Evaluation Types. There are four types of intelligence
   qualification evaluations that may be further described by the following designators.
   Qualification evaluations (QUAL) are administered at the culmination of IQT to ensure basic
   qualification in the duty position of the intelligence professional. Mission Qualification
   (MSN) evaluations ensure the individual’s ability to support full mission planning and
   employment in accomplishing the unit’s operational mission. Provisions are made to ensure
   intelligence personnel are certified and maintain specialized qualifications (e.g., external
   intelligence trainer (EIT), intelligence evaluator (IE)) and provide the flexibility to evaluate
   and certify specific intelligence performance (through SPOT evaluations). Intelligence
   personnel will complete the following types of intelligence qualification evaluations as
   appropriate:
   5.2.1. (AFISRA) Periodic qualification evaluations are administered to ensure basic
   qualification in the MDS, weapon system or intelligence function and activity and
   intelligence duty position (QUAL) and qualification to employ the MDS, weapon system or
   intelligence function and activity in accomplishing the unit’s operational mission (MSN).
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                     33


  Evaluations are also accomplished to ensure intelligence personnel are certified and maintain
  specialized qualifications (e.g., instructor (INSTR) qualification).         Evaluation and
  certification of specific member performance may also be accomplished (SPOT).
     5.2.1.1. QUAL Evaluations. All intelligence personnel will complete a QUAL
     evaluation in their primary assigned mission, to include requisites, as specified in the
     applicable AFI 14-2(MDS)v2.
     5.2.1.1. (AFISRA) QUAL and MSN evaluation requisites may include open book
     examination, closed book examination, and if applicable, Critical Action Procedures
     (CAPs) / EPE.
     5.2.1.2. MSN Evaluations. All intelligence personnel maintaining MR/CMR or BMC
     status will complete an initial MSN evaluation (INIT MSN) upon the completion of
     Mission Qualification Training. Periodic MSN evaluations in their primary assigned
     mission, to include requisites in the applicable AFI 14-2(MDS)v2, are then administered
     to ensure proficiency is maintained. The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and
     difficulty of tasks required in the performance of support to contingency and training
     operations.
     5.2.1.2. (AFISRA) QUAL and MSN evaluations may be combined into a single
     evaluation as specified in AFI 14-2(MDS)v2.
     5.2.1.3. Specialized Qualification Evaluations. All intelligence personnel maintaining
     specialized qualifications in a particular MDS, weapons system or intelligence function
     or activity, must complete initial and periodic evaluations of their specialized
     qualifications IAW their respective AFI 14-2(MDS), Volumes 1-3.
         5.2.1.3.1. (Added-AFISRA) Instructor          Evaluations.   Intelligence    personnel
         maintaining Instructor qualification in a particular MDS must complete initial and
         periodic evaluations of instructional capability in that MDS. The emphasis on an
         Initial Instructor (INIT INSTR) evaluation should be placed on examinee
         demonstration of instructional ability. This does not preclude the update of a required
         periodic evaluation if all required task (mission performance) phase requirements are
         completed during the instructor evaluation and the examinee subsequently completes
         all knowledge phase requirements for the evaluation within the periods described in
         paragraph 5.2.7 (Added). Label the evaluation appropriately (EXAMPLE: "INIT
         INSTR/MSN"). Do not add on missions (activities) to complete the requirements for
         a periodic evaluation unless the group/squadron commander concurs.
             5.2.1.3.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) To initially qualify as an Instructor in a particular
             MDS, weapon system or intelligence function and activity, personnel must
             successfully complete an initial Instructor (INIT INSTR) evaluation. Accomplish
             INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions whenever possible.
             When students are not available or mission requirements/crew composition
             requirements prevent inclusion of students, another intelligence person or the
             evaluator may serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s
             instructional ability.
             5.2.1.3.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) Evaluation of the ability of intelligence personnel
             to instruct will be conducted during all subsequent periodic evaluations. The AF
34                                AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010


        Form 4350 Event Check description for these periodic evaluations will not
        include Instructor (INSTR) as the AF Form 4350 duty position is already
        annotated with highest qualification demonstrated during the evaluation (e.g.
        DOC-I, TR-I, CO-I, IMS-I).
        5.2.1.3.1.3. (Added-AFISRA) If instructor qualification is lost in an MDS,
        weapon system, or intelligence function and activity, it may be regained through
        an instructor requalification evaluation (see paragraphs 5.2.3.2.2 and 5.2.3.2.3) as
        directed in AFI 14-2(MDS)v2.
     5.2.1.3.2. (Added-AFISRA) Intelligence Evaluator Certification. When directed in
     AFI 14-2(MDS)v2 intelligence personnel selected to attain Intelligence Evaluator
     certification must be qualified in instructor ability (see paragraph 5.2.1.3.1 (Added))
     and maintain the instructor qualification. Intelligence Evaluator certification will be
     IAW AFI 14-2(MDS)v2. The emphasis on initial Intelligence Evaluator certification
     training is the candidate evaluator’s knowledge of evaluator duties, objectivity and
     evaluation ability. Intelligence Evaluator certification will be demonstrated during
     subsequent IE spot objectivity evaluations and will not be used to update a required
     periodic evaluation. Procedures and time limits for initial and subsequent IE
     objectivity evaluations will be addressed in unit supplements.
     5.2.1.3.3. (Added-AFISRA) Intelligence Evaluator Evaluations. When and as
     directed in the AFI 14-2(MDS) series volumes intelligence personnel maintaining
     Intelligence Evaluator qualification must complete initial evaluations of evaluator
     ability. The emphasis on an initial Intelligence Evaluator (INIT IE) evaluation is the
     candidate evaluator’s demonstration of evaluator duties, objectivity and ability.
     Initial IE evaluations will not be used to update a required periodic evaluation.
        5.2.1.3.3.1. (Added-AFISRA) Initial Intelligence Evaluator Evaluations. To
        initially qualify as an Intelligence Evaluator personnel must successfully complete
        an INIT IE evaluation. Accomplish INIT IE evaluations on actual missions or
        activities whenever possible. When examinees are not available or mission
        requirements/crew composition requirements prevent inclusion of an examinee,
        another intelligence person or the evaluator may serve as the student for the
        purpose of evaluating the IE candidate’s evaluator ability. Annotate use of
        simulated student in the Comments section of the AF Form 4350, Certificate of
        Intelligence Qualification IAW AFI14-202v2 and as supplemented. Initial IE
        evaluations will not be used to update a required periodic evaluation. The AF
        Form 4350 Event Check description for these initial evaluations will be annotated
        INIT IE and the AF Form 4350 duty position will be documented as IE. Initial IE
        evaluations may be conducted on AFISRA authorized simulations.
        5.2.1.3.3.2. (Added-AFISRA) Intelligence Evaluator Periodic Evaluations.
        Periodic evaluation of the ability of intelligence personnel to evaluate may be
        conducted during subsequent periodic evaluations. IE periodic evaluations will
        be IAW their respective AFI 14-2(MDS), Volumes 1-3. The emphasis of IE
        periodic evaluations is evaluator objectivity. The examinee is required to
        demonstrate evaluator objectivity in a graded area. Evaluators will brief specific
        area(s) in which examinee demonstrated evaluator objectivity, and document
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                     35


            these on the back of the AF Form 4350. To the maximum extent possible, the IE
            periodic should be scheduled with an actual examinee. An IE periodic evaluation
            that is combined with the positional evaluation must clearly delineate roles during
            the evaluation. An IE is only required to complete one IE periodic evaluation
            regardless of the number of qualifications held. The AF Form 4350 Event Check
            description for these periodic evaluations will not include Intelligence Evaluator
            (IE) as the AF Form 4350 duty position is already annotated with highest
            qualification demonstrated during the evaluation (e.g. DOC-IE, TR-IE, CO-IE,
            IMS-IE).
            5.2.1.3.3.3. (Added-AFISRA) If evaluator qualification is lost, it may be
            regained through an intelligence evaluator requalification evaluation (see
            paragraphs 5.2.3.2.7 (Added), 5.2.3.2.7.1 (Added) and 5.2.3.2.7.2 (Added)) as
            directed in AFI 14-2(MDS)v2.
     5.2.1.4. SPOT Evaluations (Optional). A SPOT evaluation is an evaluation not intended
     to satisfy the requirements of a periodic (i.e., MSN) or specialized qualification
     evaluation. SPOT evaluations have no specific requisites or requirements, unless
     specified in MAJCOM supplements. An evaluation begun as a SPOT evaluation may
     become (and be documented as) a required periodic evaluation if all requirements are
     completed during the SPOT evaluation and the examinee subsequently completes all
     knowledge phase requirements for the evaluation within the periods described in
     paragraph 5.2.6. Do not add on events to complete the requirements for a periodic
     evaluation unless the SIO concurs with the member’s desire to realign the evaluation
     expiration date and approves the additional time requirements. All evaluations not listed
     in paragraphs 5.2.1.1. - 5.2.1.4. will be documented as SPOT evaluations. Note: When
     the evaluator administering a SPOT evaluation is not qualified in support to the MDS or
     position of the examinee, the evaluation will not be credited toward a periodic evaluation.
        5.2.1.4.1. (Added-AFISRA) IE Objectivity Evaluations. An evaluation of the
        objectivity and skill of an IE in administering an evaluation. Use SPOT as the type of
        evaluation under the Task Phase, then explain in the mission description that the
        evaluation was an IE Objectivity Evaluation. Overall rating for this type of an
        evaluation will be either qualified (1) or unqualified (3).
            5.2.1.4.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) The grading criteria in Attachment 12 (Added)
            will be used.
            5.2.1.4.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) A qualified rating (1) indicates that the IE
            objectivity examinee complied with HHQ and local Stan/Eval directives, properly
            briefed and debriefed the examinee, correctly identified discrepancies, awarded
            the correct grade for each evaluated area, awarded the appropriate overall grade
            and, if required, assigned appropriate additional training.
            5.2.1.4.1.3. (Added-AFISRA) An unqualified rating (3) will be awarded when
            the IE objectivity examinee failed to satisfy the requirements of a qualification
            rating (1). The certification of the lower level IE receiving an unqualified IE
            Objectivity Evaluation will be determined by the SQ/CC or GP/CC as applicable.
            The SQ/CC or GP/CC may, at his/her discretion issue a commander directed AF
            Form 4350 for the examinee based upon the higher level IE recommendation.

  5.2.2. Combined Intelligence Evaluations.        To promote efficient use of resources,
  accomplish evaluations concurrently, whenever practical. If combined, include the
  designation of each evaluation in the Task Phase of the AF Form 4350 - e.g., EIT/MSN.
  5.2.2. (AFISRA) If combined, include the designation of each evaluation in the Task Phase
  of the AF Form 4350, e.g., RQ INSTR/MSN. Evaluations in multiple duty positions will be
  addressed in unit supplements.
  5.2.3. Intelligence Evaluation Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, if applicable, to
  further describe the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1. - 5.2.1.4.:
     5.2.3.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for a position or specialized
     qualification (e.g., INIT MSN, INIT EIT).
     5.2.3.1. (AFISRA) (e.g., INIT QUAL, INIT MSN, INIT INSTR, INIT INSTR/MSN).
     5.2.3.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to requalify on an item due to
     loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items as specified in applicable AFI
     14-2(MDS)v1), a recheck following a failed periodic evaluation (see paragraph 7.4.7. for
     rechecks) or loss of qualification due to supervisor or SIO-directed downgrade.
     5.2.3.2. (AFISRA) Requalification is also used to remedy a loss of qualification due to
     expiration of a required periodic evaluation.
         5.2.3.2.1. When loss of qualification is for expiration of a required periodic
         evaluation, the evaluation given will be IAW the guidance for that periodic
         evaluation. The AF Form 4350 description will be documented with an RQ prefix.
         5.2.3.2.2. When loss of qualification is due to loss of currency, the evaluation profile
         will be as directed by the SIO and will include, as a minimum, those items for which
         the individual is non-current for over 6 months. The AF Form 4350 Event/Check
         description will be documented with RQ SPOT (exception: when loss of
         qualification is due to loss of currency for specialized qualification as defined in AFI
         14-2(MDS)v1, the AF Form 4350 Event/Check description will be documented with
         RQ specialized qualification evaluation designator (e.g. RQ EIT)).
         5.2.3.2.2. (AFISRA) Note: (See paragraph 5.2.1.4) An evaluation begun as a SPOT
         evaluation may become (and be documented as) a required periodic evaluation if all
         requirements are completed during the SPOT evaluation and the examinee
         subsequently completes all knowledge phase requirements for the evaluation within
         the periods described in paragraph 5.2.6
         5.2.3.2.3. When loss of qualification is for failure to pass an evaluation, the recheck
         evaluation will be IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.2.12. The AF Form 4350
         Event/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT, as
         applicable.
         5.2.3.2.4. When loss of qualification is due to an SIO-directed downgrade (see
         paragraph 7.4.8.), the evaluation profile will be as directed by the SIO. The AF Form
         4350 Event/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT, as
         applicable.
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                     37


         5.2.3.2.5. Do not use RQ to prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
         qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
         5.2.3.2.6. (Added-AFISRA) When requalification deals with instructor capability,
         the AF Form 4350 Event/Check description will be documented with RQ INSTR (not
         RQ SPOT).
         5.2.3.2.7. (Added-AFISRA) When requalification deals with Intelligence Evaluator
         capability, the AF Form 4350 Event/Check description will be documented with RQ
         IE (not RQ SPOT).
             5.2.3.2.7.1. (Added-AFISRA) The emphasis of all RQ IE evaluations is
             evaluator duties, objectivity and ability. These evaluations should be scheduled
             with a crewmember requiring an evaluation. As a last resort, a qualified
             crewmember or the evaluator may act as the examinee. Annotate (Note) use of
             simulated student in the Comments section of the AF Form 4350, Certificate of
             Intelligence Qualification IAW AFI14-202, Volume 2, as supplemented.
             5.2.3.2.7.2. (Added-AFISRA) Requalification IE evaluations will not be used to
             satisfy requirements of a periodic evaluation. Intelligence Personnel RQ IE
             evaluations may be conducted on AFISRA authorized simulations.
     5.2.3.3. No-Notice (N/N). A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified
     of the evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for an event. The
     beginning of normal preparation for an event will be determined by the evaluator and
     may be defined further by the unit. The intent is to preclude extraordinary preparation for
     the event because it is to be an evaluation.
         5.2.3.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides SIOs and supervisors a
         sampling of daily performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
         5.2.3.3.1. (AFISRA) The no-notice evaluation program provides unit commanders
         and supervisors a sampling of daily performance and an assessment of unit training
         effectiveness.
         5.2.3.3.2. If an examinee elects, a no-notice evaluation may update a MSN
         evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the evaluation are completed
         within the periods described in paragraph 5.2.6. If all requirements were not
         completed on the first event, subsequent events are authorized to complete required
         events. If the examinee elects not to update a MSN evaluation expiration date, the
         evaluation will be documented as a N/N SPOT evaluation.
     5.2.3.4. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation (e.g., N/N SPOT).
     The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined evaluations will be
     explained under Task Description in the Evaluator’s Remarks (see paragraph 7.4.5.8.).
     5.2.3.5. (Added-AFISRA) Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the task phase
     requisite is conducted under approved simulated conditions.
  5.2.4. Knowledge Phase Requisites. The knowledge phase for periodic intelligence
  qualification evaluations includes a series of requisites listed below. See Chapter 6 of this
  instruction for additional guidelines on examinations.
 38                                       AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010


         5.2.4.1. QUAL Evaluations. As specified in AFI 14-2(MDS)v2.
         5.2.4.2. MSN Evaluations. As specified in AFI 14-2(MDS)v2.
      5.2.5. Task Phase Requisites. The profile used to fulfill the task phase requisite must
      incorporate all appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 14-2(MDS)v2, and allow
      accurate measure of the proficiency of the examinee. Evaluation profiles will reflect unit
      tasking, daily training events, be realistic and incorporate current operational support
      requirements.
      5.2.5. (AFISRA) Such profiles will be based on training programs when applicable, and
      scenarios constructed by the operational squadron.
         5.2.5.1. (Added-AFISRA) Evaluation profile.             The evaluation profile lists all
         tasks/subtasks that an individual duty position may be evaluated on during an evaluation
         and relates those tasks to the overall required grading criteria for the duty position.
             5.2.5.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) There will be a different evaluation profile for each
             MDS, weapons system, or intelligence function and activity that a duty position
             covers. Each task or grading criteria, covering a number of tasks, will have a task
             scenario card in the event that a specific activity(s) is not observed during the live
             mission on which the evaluation is conducted.
             5.2.5.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) Product check checklists will be incorporated into the
             evaluation profiles for those duty positions that require product checks.
             5.2.5.1.3. (Added-AFISRA) Evaluation profiles will be combined into a single unit
             evaluation profile letter and signed by the unit commander. The evaluation profiles
             letter will be posted in the IRF IAW governing guidance, where it will be available
             for review by all intelligence personnel prior to an evaluation.
      5.2.6. Timing of Intelligence Qualification Evaluations.
         5.2.6.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 19th
         month following the month in which the task phase was successfully completed (e.g. an
         individual’s INIT MSN occurs in January 2007, the individual enters continuation
         training in February 2007, the eligibility window for the individual’s periodic MSN
         begins in March 2007, and certification expires in September 2008). (See Table 5.1.)
         5.2.6.1. (AFISRA) For AFISRA intelligence units required periodic evaluations expire
         on the last day of the 17th month following the month in which the task phase was
         successfully completed (e.g. a periodic evaluation in which the task phase was completed
         on 9 Oct 04 expires on 31 Mar 06.). (See Table 5.2 (Added)).

      5.2.6.2. Scheduling. Schedule periodic evaluations in the eligibility period (6-month
      period prior to expiration date).
      5.2.6.2. (AFISRA) Every effort should be made to schedule intelligence personnel
      periodic evaluations during the first half (3 months) of the eligibility window to preclude
      qualification expiration, extensions, waivers and/or out-of-the-eligibility period
      evaluations.
      5.2.6.3. SIO-Extended Evaluations. SIOs may extend the expiration date of periodic
      evaluations up to 3 months for the reasons listed below. Document such extensions with
      a Memo for Record placed in the individual’s on-line intelligence training and evaluation
      record.
      5.2.6.3. (AFISRA) Place the original document or a copy of the memo in the
      individual’s evaluation folder.
         5.2.6.3.1. Individual assigned PCS/PCA.
         5.2.6.3.2. Individual departing for extended TDY.
         5.2.6.3.3. Individual removal from active intel status (e.g. separation or retirement
         from the Service).
40                                     AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010


         5.2.6.3.4. Individual participating in real world operations (to include operations
         other than war, etc.) who are not able to complete the required event evaluation(s)
         before or during deployment.
         5.2.6.3.4. (AFISRA) This also includes unavailability of systems/assets due to
         deployments in support of real world operations.
     5.2.6.4. Transfers. Upon PCS or TDY, individuals meeting the requirements specified in
     the gaining MAJCOM intelligence directives (if applicable) may retain current
     qualifications. However, prior to performing duties unsupervised at a new unit, they
     must meet the following requirements:
         5.2.6.4.1. Satisfactorily complete training requirements directed by the gaining
         MAJCOM and the unit.
         5.2.6.4.1. (AFISRA) At a minimum, individuals will complete unit specific local
         procedures training.
         5.2.6.4.2. Satisfactorily complete the Intelligence Stan/Eval written examination for
         the duty position.
         5.2.6.4.2. (AFISRA) At a minimum, the Stan/Eval written examination will assess
         individual knowledge of unit specific local procedures.         Stan/Eval written
         examination procedures will be outlined in the unit supplement.
  5.2.7. Requisite Completion. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements
  of combined evaluations as defined in AFI 14-2(MDS)v2. Requisites from a completed
  evaluation may not be used for subsequent evaluations.
  5.2.7. (AFISRA) For all evaluations, accomplish requisites as follows:
     5.2.7.1. (Added-AFISRA) In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic
     evaluations in the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the six-month
     eligibility period prior to the expiration date of the current evaluation period to update
     that expiration date.
     5.2.7.2. (Added-AFISRA) Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations
     outside the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period
     encompassing the month in which the task evaluation was administered. EXCEPTION:
     For extended evaluations, requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-
     month eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration
     date.
     5.2.7.3. (Added-AFISRA) Recheck. For evaluations used to remedy a failed evaluation:
         5.2.7.3.1. (Added-AFISRA) Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per
         paragraph 5.2.7.1 (Added) or 5.2.7.2 (Added) remain valid, IAW paragraph 5.2.12
         5.2.7.3.2. (Added-AFISRA) Valid requisite completion dates from the Q-3 AF
         Form 4350 will not be annotated on the recheck AF Form 4350. The recheck AF
         Form 4350 will only include documentation of the task phase evaluation, unless
         requisites were not completed or are required to complete the recheck. If the
         task/event recheck is completed prior to completion of required requisites, delay
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                          41


         completion of the AF Form 4350 until requisites are complete and enter the requisites
         on the recheck AF Form 4350.
  5.2.8. Evaluation Criteria Source. The lead MAJCOM will establish and maintain
  standardized QUAL, MSN and specialized qualification evaluation criteria in the appropriate
  AFI 14-2(MDS)v2. The lead MAJCOM is responsible for coordinating the establishment of
  areas/subareas to be used for documenting required evaluations including those required and
  critical for evaluation completion. A critical area is a designated area that is absolutely
  necessary for the success of the mission where failure to follow the strict requirements of
  instructions/regulations, safe operations or conduct could compromise the mission. Grade all
  critical areas as either qualified (Q) or unqualified (U). Critical areas will be identified in the
  individual AFI 14-2(MDS)v2s as applicable.
  5.2.9. Grading system. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and document
  performance. The first tier is comprised of the individual areas/subareas (e.g. debriefing,
  mission planning, etc.) where a grade of Q, Q- or U is assigned based on established criteria,
  cumulative grades for each task (e.g. preparation, delivery, adherence to unit standards, etc.)
  in an area/subarea on a gradesheet and evaluator judgment. The second tier consists of the
  overall qualification level itself (Q-1, Q-2 or Q-3) which is determined from the compilation
  of these individual scores/grades from all the individual areas/subareas.
  5.2.9. (AFISRA) EPEs, when applicable, will be graded by qualification levels Q-1, Q-2 or
  Q-3.
     5.2.9.1. Written, Computer Based or Electronic Examinations. Grade written, computer
     based or electronic examinations as a percentage of correct answers. See paragraph
     6.4.6. for minimum passing grade specifics.
     5.2.9.2. Area/Subarea Grades. AFI 14-2(MDS)v2, will establish areas and subareas to
     be evaluated and the appropriate grading criteria for those areas/subareas. Areas will
     have a two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system. The overall area grade
     will be the lowest of any subarea grade awarded.
         5.2.9.2.1. Qualified (Q). Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee
         demonstrated a satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed
         intelligence duties within the prescribed tolerances and accomplished the assigned
         mission.
         5.2.9.2.2. Qualified with discrepancies (Q-). Q- indicates the examinee is qualified
         to perform the assigned area tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as
         determined by the evaluator. Deviations from established standards must not exceed
         the prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize safety/security.
         5.2.9.2.3. Unqualified (U). Assign a U area grade for any performance outside
         allowable parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that
         adversely affected mission accomplishment or compromised safety. An examinee
         receiving an area grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in the
         judgment of the evaluator, additional training will not constructively improve the
         examinee’s performance, it is not required. In this case, the evaluator must
         thoroughly debrief the examinee.
42                                    AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010


     5.2.9.3. Qualification Levels. Overall evaluation performance is graded by qualification
     levels as follows:
         5.2.9.3.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1).     The member demonstrated desired
         performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within
         tolerances specified in the grading criteria. This will be awarded when no
         discrepancies were noted and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
             5.2.9.3.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any
             area(s)/subarea(s).
             5.2.9.3.1.2. In the judgment of the evaluator, none of the discrepancies preclude
             awarding an overall Qualification Level 1.
             5.2.9.3.1.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during the
             debrief of that evaluation.
         5.2.9.3.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The member demonstrated the ability to
         perform duties, but:
             5.2.9.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training
             was assigned.
             5.2.9.3.2.2. A non-critical area(s)/subarea(s) grade of U was awarded.
             5.2.9.3.2.3. In the judgment of the evaluator, there is justification based on
             performance in one or several areas/subareas.
         5.2.9.3.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The member demonstrated an unacceptable
         level of safety, performance or knowledge.
             5.2.9.3.3.1. An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires an overall Q-3
             for the evaluation.
             5.2.9.3.3.2. An overall Q-3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the evaluator,
             there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/subareas.
  5.2.10. Grading Policies.
     5.2.10.1. Requisite Examination. The evaluator will consider performance on requisite
     examinations in assigning the overall qualification level.
     5.2.10.2. Performance Areas/Subareas. Use the grading criteria in the applicable AFI
     14-2(MDS)v2, to grade areas/subareas accomplished during an evaluation.
     5.2.10.3. Overall Qualification Levels.
         5.2.10.3.1. The overall qualification level awarded is based on performance during
         both the knowledge and task phases. This grade will be awarded only after all
         evaluation requirements have been completed and given due consideration.
         5.2.10.3.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the member must satisfy
         the criteria set forth in the applicable AFI 14-2(MDS)v2 and demonstrate proficiency
         in all phases of an evaluation.
         5.2.10.3.3. Overall qualification grades will be a cumulative process. While AFI 14-
         2(MDS)v2 may dictate the highest grade for an event based on area and subarea
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                      43


         performance, evaluator judgment will always be the determining factor in deciding
         the overall qualification level.
  5.2.11. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or less require action to remedy the discrepancy.
  Remedial action includes debriefing the discrepancies and/or assignment of additional
  training and/or imposing of restrictions.
     5.2.11.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the
     evaluation wherein the evaluator provides briefing/instruction concerning the discrepancy
     and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency to
     remedy the discrepancy. The discrepancy area/subarea description is annotated with
     ―Debriefed‖ in paragraph B of the Evaluator’s Remarks section of the AF Form 4350
     Comments.
     5.2.11.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by an evaluator to remedy
     deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
         5.2.11.2.1. Additional training may include self-study, instruction, use of a computer
         based training program or an event. Once additional training is complete, the
         examinee must demonstrate satisfactory knowledge or proficiency.
         5.2.11.2.2. Additional training is documented in paragraph C, Recommended
         Additional Training, under Evaluator’s Remarks in the AF Form 4350 Comments.
         Description of additional training will include how satisfactory knowledge or
         proficiency will be demonstrated to an evaluator, supervisor or instructor.
         5.2.11.2.3. Due dates and dates on which additional training is completed will be
         documented in the appropriate areas of the AF Form 4350 (see paragraphs 7.4.5.6.
         and 7.4.5.7.).
            5.2.11.2.3.1. For Active Duty intelligence personnel, additional training due dates
            will be no later than the end of the first full month following the month in which
            the evaluation was conducted. For example, if an evaluation is accomplished on
            15 February, all additional training must be completed by 31 March.
            5.2.11.2.3.2. For AFRC and ANG intelligence personnel, to include IMAs,
            additional training due dates will be no later than the end of the second full month
            or two unit training assemblies (UTAs) following the month in which the
            evaluation was conducted. For example, if an evaluation is accomplished on 15
            February, all additional training must be completed by 30 April (assuming the
            individual attended two UTAs during that time to complete the requirements).
     5.2.11.3. Restrictions.
         5.2.11.3.1. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the judgment
         of the evaluator and/or supervisor, the examinee will not perform applicable duties
         while unsupervised until successful completion of assigned additional training and/or
         a recheck.
         5.2.11.3.2. Restrictions should address the specific task or event that requires
         supervision until successful retraining is completed. Restrictions are not punitive, but
         designed to enhance performance and proficiency.
44                                     AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010


         5.2.11.3.2. (AFISRA) Restrictions should address the criteria for removal of the
         restrictions.
             5.2.11.3.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) Substandard performance in any area/subarea
             may require restrictions to ensure operational safety or mission accomplishment.
             5.2.11.3.2.2. (Added-AFISRA) Formal training units will include restrictions on
             the AF Forms 4350 for any required items not accomplished due to training
             limitations, regardless if the method of qualification is by evaluation or instructor
             certification. Under no circumstance will intelligence personnel perform duties in
             areas with restrictions imposed unless under the direct supervision of an
             instructor. In this case, MDS, weapon system or intelligence function and activity
             specific guidance will outline requirements for removal of restrictions.
         5.2.11.3.3. Specific restrictions will be documented.
         5.2.11.3.3. (AFISRA) Document specific restrictions and the criteria for the
         removal of the restrictions as the first item of the AF Form 4350 Comments.
         Restrictions associated with failed requisite examinations will not be documented on
         the AF Form 4350.
  5.2.12. Failure to Pass an Evaluation.
     5.2.12.1. Recheck. If an individual fails an evaluation, a successful recheck must be
     completed within 30 days (60 days for ARC or two UTAs). SIOs may approve waivers
     to the time limits up to an additional 30 days (30 days or one UTA for ARC) on a case-
     by-case basis. Document such action with a Memo for Record.
     5.2.12.1. (AFISRA) A recheck is successfully completed when the individual performs
     to Q criteria (Q or Q-/debriefed) for each area graded U. Document commander
     approved waivers to the recheck time limit with a Memo for Record placed in Section II
     of the EF. Incorporate the information contained in the memo onto the affected AF Form
     4350 under Evaluator’s Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when action is
     complete, and remove the memo from the EF. Memos for Record become a permanent
     part of the EF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the memo is not addressed
     or corrected by a later Form 4350. Every reasonable effort must be made to requalify the
     individual. Commanders will determine the number of event checks to be allowed during
     this period, based on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and hours of
     training required. The intelligence evaluator that administered the original check will not
     normally administer the recheck.
     5.2.12.2. Status Downgrade. Downgrade members receiving a Q-3 on a QUAL or MSN
     evaluation to non-mission ready (N-MR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR), non-basic
     mission capable (N-BMC), or non-basic qualified (N-BQ) status, as applicable. For
     specialized qualification evaluations, status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC) need not be
     downgraded if the discrepancies were only in specialized qualification areas. Note:
     Status downgrade does not affect AFSC skill levels.
     5.2.12.3. Restrictions. Restrict individuals failing to complete an evaluation within the
     required period or receiving a Q-3 on an evaluation, as listed above, until a successful
     evaluation is completed:
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                         45


      5.2.12.3. (AFISRA) When called for by this instruction, and as supplemented or
      deemed necessary in the judgment of the intelligence evaluator, restrictions will be
      imposed on the examinee until successful completion of assigned additional training
      and/or a recheck.
          5.2.12.3.1. QUAL Evaluation. Place the examinee on supervised status.
          5.2.12.3.1. (AFISRA) For QUAL evaluations, place the examinee on supervised
          status in the MDS, weapon system or intelligence function and activity for which the
          evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy
          is applicable to additional MDS, weapon system or intelligence function and activity.
          For specialized qualified, universally qualified, or multiple qualified intelligence
          individuals maintaining qualification for similar duty in multiple MDS, weapon
          system or intelligence function and activities, AFI 14-2(MDS)v2 may direct
          supervised status in all MDS, weapon system or intelligence function and activity in
          which the individual maintains qualification.
          5.2.12.3.2. MSN Evaluation. The examinee may perform basic qualification tasks
          unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on supervised status for mission
          tasks.
          5.2.12.3.3. Specialized Qualification Evaluation.        Examinees receiving an
          unsatisfactory grade in any specialized area(s) will not perform specialized duties
          until a successful recheck is complete.
   5.2.13. Supervised Status. If unsatisfactory performance requires the member to be placed
   on supervised status, the type of supervisor will be determined by the SIO (or equivalent) or
   as specified in AFI 14-2(MDS)v1.
   5.2.14. (Added-AFISRA) Alternate Means of Evaluation. When live-mission evaluation of
   a required area is not possible, the area may be evaluated verbally or via an approved
   simulation. Intelligence Evaluators will make every effort to evaluate all required areas
   during a live-mission before resorting to this option. See the appropriate AFI 14-2(MDS)v2,
   for areas prohibited from verbal/simulated evaluation.
   5.2.15. (Added-AFISRA) Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If
   an individual fails to complete an evaluation (either knowledge phase or task phase) within
   the eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in
   paragraph 5.2.7.2 (Added) for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, the individual loses
   the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph 5.2.12.3 apply.
   Qualification may be re-established by administering a requalification evaluation (see
   paragraph 5.2.3.2) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation. GP/CCs may approve
   waivers to preclude the re-accomplishment of completed requisites to complete the
   evaluation on a case-by-case basis. Document such action with a Memo for Record placed in
   Section II of the EF. Incorporate the information contained in the memo onto the affected AF
   Form 4350 under Evaluator’s Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when action is
   complete, and remove the memo from the EF. Memos for Record become a permanent part
   of the EF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the memo is not addressed or
   corrected by a later Form 4350.
5.3. (Added-AFISRA) Emergency Procedures Evaluations (when applicable).
 46                                     AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010


   5.3.1. (Added-AFISRA) Scope. Evaluate intelligence personnel’s knowledge of MDS-
   Specific EPs and systems knowledge for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate MSN specific
   emergency procedures and systems knowledge during MSN evaluations. Only one EPE
   needs to be accomplished for each combined evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a MSN/QUAL
   evaluation). The combined EPE must be of a scope and duration to cover required areas and
   must be within the requisite zone for each evaluation.
   5.3.2. (Added-AFISRA) Satisfactory Performance. Satisfactory performance for EPEs
   requires knowing or performing the proper action in the correct sequence, responses may be
   verbal. Intelligence personnel are responsible for any CAPs when applicable to their duty
   position.
   5.3.3. (Added-AFISRA) Content and Administration. AFI 14-2(MDS)v2 will specify
   contents of EPEs, grading areas to be evaluated, grading criteria and whether EPEs may be
   done during a live mission, on a SIM, or verbally.
   5.3.4. (Added-AFISRA) Grading. The intelligence evaluator will assign an EPE grade 1, 2,
   or 3 (Qualification Level 1, 2, or 3) in the Qualification Knowledge Phase block of the AF
   Form 4350, regardless of whether all or a portion of the EPE was performed during a live
   mission.
   5.3.5. (Added-AFISRA) Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the
   intelligence evaluator will indicate if the additional training will be accomplished before
   intelligence individual can perform duties unsupervised in the assigned duty position under
   restrictions in the Comments block of the AF Form 4350.
   5.3.6. (Added-AFISRA) CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a CAP situation during an
   EPE requires an unqualified (3) EPE grade. Any intelligence personnel who receives a 3
   grade as a result of CAPs error will not perform duties in the assigned duty position again
   until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.
   5.3.7. (Added-AFISRA) Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an unqualified EPE
   grade (3) will be placed on supervised status until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.
5.4. (Added-AFISRA) Supplementary             Evaluations. Supplementary    evaluations  are
administrative tools used by a commander to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to
operational problems. These evaluations are most often administered as inspections (using
specifically prepared checklists) where results are reported to the commander. The form and
content of supplementary evaluations is at the discretion of the commander.
   5.4.1. (Added-AFISRA) Supplementary evaluations           are   not   intelligence   personnel
   qualification evaluations.
   5.4.2. (Added-AFISRA) Supplementary evaluations should examine the effectiveness of
   unit operational procedures and training programs. They may be used as an effective means
   of validating the effectiveness of evaluation trend corrective actions.
   5.4.3. (Added-AFISRA) Commanders will determine evaluated areas. The stan/eval
   function will determine the method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative
   management of data collection, and will report results as directed by the commander.
   5.4.4. (Added-AFISRA) Individuals other than intelligence evaluators, as determined by
   the GP/CC, may conduct supplementary evaluations.
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                47


  5.4.5. (Added-AFISRA) Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction
  with a qualification evaluation. If conducted during a mission, supplementary evaluations
  should not be all-encompassing, nor result in the assignment of an overall rating for any
  specific intelligence personnel, nor be documented on an AF Form 4350.
  5.4.6. (Added-AFISRA) Supplementary evaluation results will be documented in SEB
  minutes
 48                                     AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010

                      INTELLIGENCE EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The Intelligence Examination Program measures an individual’s knowledge of
normal procedures, threats and other information essential for effective intelligence operations
through the administration of written, computer based or electronic examinations. Poor testing
performance on examinations indicates areas requiring increased training emphasis.
6.2. Scope. The Intelligence Examination Program includes requisite examinations for periodic
evaluations and unit periodic examinations. Requisite examinations include qualification open
book and closed book tests as described in paragraph 5.2.4.
6.2. (AFISRA) The ability to focus on specific knowledge areas is enhanced by the
management of examination content and use of appropriate master question files.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation.          Lead MAJCOM will describe the MDS/weapons
   system/function/activity-specific intelligence examination program in written guidance.
   Units will describe the unit specific examination process in written guidance.
   6.3.1. (AFISRA) Units will use an AFISRA approved computer based or on-line Stan/Eval
   examination software for program management when available and directed.
       6.3.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) Computer Based or Electronic Examinations. Computer
       based or electronic information management tools may fulfill the requirement for
       examinations as outlined in this instruction.
   6.3.2. Retention of Examination Records.      Retain graded exam answer sheets/computer
   records until AF Form 4350 is completed.
   6.3.3. Examination Question Review. Intelligence Stan/Eval will review all MQFs (HHQ
   and local) and prepared exams for accuracy annually and after any changes in source
   documents. Identify corrections/changes to HHQ MQF to the responsible MAJCOM.
   6.3.3. (AFISRA) Intelligence Stan/Eval will review all secure question banks (HHQ and
   local) and prepared exams for accuracy annually and after any changes in source documents.
   If a complete review was accomplished due to a source document change it may be annotated
   as the annual review. Units will document their procedures for reviewing and updating MQFs
   and prepared exams in their unit supplement to this instruction.
   6.3.4. (Added-AFISRA) End-of-Course Examinations. IFTUs administering USAF Formal
   Schools listed in the Air Force Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA)
   database (https://etca.randolph.af.mil) may use end-of-course (EOC) examinations to fulfill
   the requirements of the open book, and closed book and EPE/CAPs (if applicable) requisite
   examinations when directed in the AFI 14-2(MDS)v2. IFTU graduates will be Basic
   Qualified status upon of successful completion of a qualification evaluation and will require
   an MSN evaluation from assigned unit for MR/CMR status.
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                     49


       6.3.4.1. (Added-AFISRA) Unless otherwise stated in the AFI 14-2(MDS)v2, the IFTU
       in coordination with AFISRA Stan/Eval will ensure the EOC examination meets the
       requirements of this instruction before awarding credit for requisite completion.
       6.3.4.2. (Added-AFISRA) EOC examination test questions are not required to
       incorporate MAJCOM MQFs. All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems
       and/or operational procedures and not conflict with any MQFs.
       6.3.4.3. (Added-AFISRA) All EOC examinations that fulfill the requirements of
       requisite examinations will be graded according to paragraph 6.4.6 and entered on the AF
       Form 4350.
6.4. Required Tests. Individuals will complete examinations as requisites for periodic MSN
evaluations (see paragraph 5.2.4.) and any other examination required by the appropriate AFI 14-
2(MDS)v2. Requisites may be completed anytime during the eligibility period for credit.
6.4. (AFISRA) Intelligence personnel will complete open and closed book requisites for
periodic QUAL evaluations and any other examinations required by the appropriate AFI 14-
2(MDS)v2 (see paragraph 5. 2.4.1). For IFTU see paragraph 6.3.4 (Added).
   6.4.1. Unit Intelligence Stan/Eval functions will develop and control written examinations
   for each duty position. However, when different duty positions are responsible for identical
   information, a single examination will suffice.
   6.4.2. Unit Intelligence Stan/Eval will maintain two tests on file for each duty position and
   ensure that no more than 50% of the questions are duplicated between tests.
   6.4.3. Units using computer-generated examinations do not need to maintain the
   examinations referenced above provided the following restrictions are observed:
       6.4.3.1. Individual examinations are randomly generated from the standardized MQF.
       6.4.3.2. Re-examinations are constructed so that duplication of questions is kept to a
       minimum.
   6.4.4. Change 50 percent of the questions on the requisite examinations every calendar year.
   6.4.5. Test Security. Intelligence Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all
   tests, applicable answer sheets and associated computer based/electronic media.
   6.4.5. (AFISRA) Ensure all controlled test materials (e.g., secure question banks,
   examinations, answer sheets) are appropriately and conspicuously marked.
   6.4.6. Grading Policy. Minimum Passing Grade.            The minimum passing grade for
   examinations is 85 percent-corrected to 100 percent.
   6.4.7. Types of Tests.
       6.4.7.1. Open Book Tests. Open book test questions will come from publications made
       available to the individual during testing. Each unit may develop an open book secure
       question bank (SQB) that serves as the source for some or all of the open book test
       questions. Do not distribute the SQB to personnel and safeguard it in the same manner as
       any other required Intelligence Stan/Eval examination.
50                                   AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010


        6.4.7.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) The emphasis of open book exams is on technical
        orders, manuals, handbooks and instructions that may not require immediate recall or
        are not regularly referenced.
        6.4.7.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) Units will forward SQBs to AFISRA Stan/Eval for
        approval. AFISRA Stan/Eval will maintain the master copy of all SQBs.
        6.4.7.1.3. (Added-AFISRA) Do not select open book questions from any closed
        book MQF.
     6.4.7.2. Closed Book Tests. Closed book questions will come from MQFs. These
     questions will emphasize system knowledge and information necessary for mission
     accomplishment.
     6.4.7.2. (AFISRA) Major emphasis of closed book exams will be on mission systems
     and mission knowledge that the intelligence personnel must immediately recall while
     performing mission and key information from publications not readily available while
     performing mission.
        6.4.7.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) MDS-Specific MQFs. AFISRA Stan/Eval will ensure
        MDS-Specific MQFs containing approved questions for closed book testing are
        available for use and distribution to applicable intelligence personnel.
            6.4.7.2.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) The highest organization with a stan/eval
            function (Gp or Sq) may be delegated to develop MQFs for MDS, weapon
            systems or intelligence functions and activities without AFISRA expertise. That
            organization will submit these MQFs to the AFISRA Stan/Eval for approval prior
            to their publication (See paragraph 2.3.2.5.1 (Added)). HQ AFISRA Stan/Eval
            OPRs retains oversight responsibility and final authority of the all published
            MQFs.
            6.4.7.2.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA OPRs will review MQFs annually and
            distribute changes to MQFs as necessary.
               6.4.7.2.1.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) Units may edit MQFs to accommodate
               local testing procedures, classification limitations, administrative errors and
               reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational procedures; however,
               subject matter may not be changed.
               6.4.7.2.1.2.2. (Added-AFISRA) Units will forward edits of MQF questions
               to AFISRA Stan/Eval.
        6.4.7.2.2. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA Stan/Eval will maintain the master copy of all
        MQFs.
        6.4.7.2.3. (Added-AFISRA) Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and
        distribute a local procedures MQF databank to augment HHQ MQFs.
            6.4.7.2.3.1. (Added-AFISRA) Local Procedures MQFs may be used to
            supplement the AFISRA approved MQF. Units may supplement up to 20% local
            procedures MQFs. Local Procedures MQFs may include any information
            necessary for safe operations and mission accomplishment not included in the
            MQF. Local instructions, local procedures, unit supplements to AFI 14-
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                      51


              2(MDS)v3, are examples of sources for the Local Procedures MQF.
       6.4.7.3. (Added-AFISRA) Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) Requisite Examinations.
       Intelligence personnel knowledge of applicable CAPs will be evaluated through a written
       examination as a requisite to all periodic evaluations when and as required in the
       applicable AFI 14-2(MDS)v2. Satisfactory performance for a CAPs examination will
       require writing the proper critical actions in the correct sequence, not necessarily a
       verbatim response.
          6.4.7.3.1. (Added-AFISRA) The IE will assign a CAPs grade (Q or U) in the
          Qualification Knowledge Phase block of the AF Form 4350.
          6.4.7.3.2. (Added-AFISRA) CAPs examinations are written from memory.
          Abbreviations which do not affect the correct meaning of the procedure are
          acceptable.
   6.4.8. Failure to Pass. An evaluation will not be complete until all failed items have been
   successfully re-accomplished.
       6.4.8.1. Reexamination Policy. An individual failing a required test must be afforded an
       adequate study period prior to reexamination. The individual will be reevaluated using
       an alternate exam.
       6.4.8.2. Reexamination Period. Individuals who fail a required test must complete a
       successful reexamination within 30 days (AFRC/ANG: 60 days or two unit training
       assemblies (UTAs)) following the date of the failure. Waiver authority to extend the time
       allowed to successfully complete the examination is the SIO. Document such waivers
       with a Memo for Record placed in the training record of the individual.
       6.4.8.2. (AFISRA) Individuals who fail a required examination must complete a
       successful reexamination within 30 calendar days (ARC: 60 calendar days or three unit
       training assemblies (UTAs)) following the date of the failure, or the end of their
       eligibility period, whichever occurs first. Waiver authority to extend the time allowed to
       successfully complete the examination is the SIO. Document such waivers with a Memo
       for Record placed in Section II of the EF of the affected individual. Incorporate the
       information contained in the memo onto the affected AF Form 4350 under Evaluator
       Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when action is complete, and remove the
       memo from the EF. Memos for Record become a permanent part of the EF only when the
       Major discrepancy addressed by the memo is not addressed or corrected by a later AF
       Form 4350.
       6.4.8.3. Supervised Status Requirement. Place individuals who fail a requisite open
       book or closed book examination in supervised status until successful retesting is
       completed. For individuals who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status
       resulting from failure of either an open book or closed book examination applies only to
       the MDS, weapons system, function or activity for which the examination was
       administered.
6.5. (Added-AFISRA) Unit Semi-annual Examinations. Each unit will conduct testing at
least semi-annually for all intelligence personnel. The intent of this testing is to evaluate
additional knowledge beyond the scope of requisite exams, such as a cross-section of general
 52                                     AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010


knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or operational procedures, etc., to determine if
knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit. This exam may be open or closed book, but will not
count as a requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy the requirement for a periodic exam.
   6.5.1. (Added-AFISRA) Unit Semi-annual Examinations are intended to encourage
   individual review of operationally relevant topics selected by the unit commander. The unit
   commander will determine whether the test is administered open or closed book and whether
   proctoring is required. A majority of the questions must come from sources other than
   MAJCOM-approved MQFs (i.e. system manuals, Instructions, SPINS, etc). Classified tests
   will be handled appropriately.
   6.5.2. (Added-AFISRA) Units will describe this program in the unit supplement to this
   instruction, to include procedures for failed exams.
6.6. (Added-AFISRA) Stan/Eval and Training Review Board (STRB). Following a second
failure of any qualification requisite examination or event check, a commander's Stan/Eval and
Training Review Board will be scheduled. Units establish written commander's STRB
procedures using paragraph 6.7 as a guide. Outline unit procedures and time constraints for
convening of the STRB in the unit supplement to this instruction.
   6.6.1. (Added-AFISRA) The review board consists of, but is not limited to the unit
   Commander; Operations Officer (optional); unit Stan/Eval Chief or Deputy Chief ; unit
   Operations Training Chief or Deputy Chief; examinee’s supervisor; examinee’s primary
   instructor (as applicable); the intelligence evaluator (as applicable) and the examinee.
   6.6.2. (Added-AFISRA) The STRB will be chaired by the unit Commander and will
   consider all pertinent factors contributing to the failed evaluation, failure to attain/maintain
   proficiency or failure to progress.
   6.6.3. (Added-AFISRA) Although a STRB is mandatory only in the above instances, the
   unit Commander may initiate a review board at their discretion, for example after the first
   examination failure or for failure to progress in training within established guidelines.
   6.6.4. (Added-AFISRA) STRB minutes should be compiled IAW Attachment 11 (Added).
6.7. (Added-AFISRA) Commander’s Stan/Eval and Training Review Board Process. The
STRB process should be completed within 10 duty days from the date the initiating authority
(IA) recommends a board.
   6.7.1. (Added-AFISRA) Entry. Enter examinees following a second failure of any
   examination or event check. The IA, or above, enters the examinee in the STRB process
   when notified by the Chief, Stan/Eval of the failures.
   6.7.2. (Added-AFISRA) IA. The IA is a supervisor or FLT/CC with administrative control
   of the examinee. The IA:
       6.7.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) Notifies examinee in writing of their consideration for a
       STRB.
       6.7.2.2. (Added-AFISRA) Briefs the examinee on the STRB process.
       6.7.2.3. (Added-AFISRA) The IA may elect to continue the examinee in academic
       training with the concurrence of the reviewing authority (RA).
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                      53


     6.7.2.4. (Added-AFISRA) Completes a memorandum recommending the STRB,
     ensures the examinee receives a copy and is allowed to comment on a memorandum.
     6.7.2.5. (Added-AFISRA) Sends the completed memorandum to the RA along with the
     examinee’s memorandum, copies of training/evaluation records, and any attachments.
  6.7.3. (Added-AFISRA) RA. The unit commander or director of operations is the RA. The
  RA:
     6.7.3.1. (Added-AFISRA) Examines the examinee’s training records and, as necessary,
     interviews the examinee and the examinee’s civilian and military supervisors, instructors,
     or the squadron operations officer. The RA recommends elimination from or retention in
     training, or consideration for reinstatement in training and a re-evaluation at a later date
     following further review.
     6.7.3.2. (Added-AFISRA) Endorses and makes recommendation on the memorandum
     and forwards with all applicable records to the approving authority (AA) for final review.
     The records include a written summary of the significant facts and specific rationale used
     in arriving at the recommendations.
     6.7.3.3. (Added-AFISRA) Terminates or completes the STRB when it becomes
     apparent circumstances require convening an investigation under the provisions of AFI
     51-602, Boards of Officers, or when information surfaces that would cause the student to
     be medically disqualified.

                             EVALUATION DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the Intelligence Evaluation Program requires accurate
documentation. Evaluation results are recorded on the AF Form 4350, Certificate of Intelligence
Qualification, which then serves to record and certify that an individual is qualified for his or her
duty position. An individual’s chronological history of evaluations is recorded on an AF Form
4349, Record of Intelligence Evaluation. Both of these AF Forms are maintained in the
individual’s qualification evaluation record within the on-line documentation system. Evaluation
records will be kept throughout an individual’s service and go with the individual to each
assignment.
7.1. (AFISRA) Intelligence Personnel will use evaluation folders (see paragraph 7. 6) to
maintain the source documents that constitute the history of qualification (AF Forms 4350) for
each individual until an approved on-line documentation system is available and directed. A
complete history of the AF Forms 4350 in a member’s EF will be maintained on an
accompanying of an AF Form 4349, Record of Intelligence Evaluation.
7.2. On-line Documentation System. The on-line documentation system contains the source
documents that constitute the history of intelligence qualifications for each intelligence
specialist. The AF Form 4350 is the source document used to record and certify the individual’s
qualification for his/her intelligence duty position. A complete history of the AF Forms 4350 in
a member’s record is maintained on an accompanying AF Form 4349.
   7.2.1. All intelligence personnel supporting the operational mission of the unit/organization
   must have a qualification training and evaluation record, which includes all AF Forms 4350,
   AF Forms 4349, and additional MAJCOM specified items. The qualification training and
   evaluation record is separate and distinct from an individual’s training records.
       7.2.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) Qualifications and Certifications. Intelligence personnel
       qualifications are attained through evaluations and documented on the AF Form 4350.
       Intelligence personnel certifications attained through methods other than evaluation
       (instructor-certified events and commander certifications for example) may be
       documented on an AFISRA Form 403, Certification of Intelligence Personnel Training
       (see Attachment 13 (Added)), or AFISRA Form 402, Intelligence Personnel
       Certifications (see Attachment 14 (Added)). HQ AFISRA may direct the use of the
       AFISRA Form 402 or 403 for specific MDS, System, Intelligence Function or Activity.
       As an alternative to use of AFISRA Form 403 or AFISRA Form 402, AFISRA may also
       approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized official. When
       applicable, units will outline procedures for documenting intelligence personnel
       certifications using the AFISRA Form 402, AFISRA Form 403 and other AFISRA
       approved certification document in the unit supplement to this instruction.
           7.2.1.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) Changes to the qualifications/certifications which
           occur prior to the printing of a new letter of certifications product will be annotated
           and initialed by the certifying official. Units that opt not to use, or do not have access
           to an electronic certifications tracking product containing the required information
           will use a single letter indicating unit intelligence personnel qualifications and
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                         55


         certifications (see paragraph 3.3.2.8 (Added)). These letters/electronic products will
         be certified and maintained either in the EF or other suitable location. A letter of
         certification extract (abbreviated document) which only contains the pertinent
         individual(s) information may be used; such extract must be signed by the original
         letter of certification certifying official. A certified letter/product will be included in
         the individual's EF going PCS or PCA. If an individual’s EF is required to be hand
         carried TDY, a copy of this certified letter/product will be included. Short duration
         TDYs (<120 days) do not require transfer of the EF; a letter of certification extract for
         the individual should suffice.
  7.2.2. Evaluation Materials Contained in the On-Line Documentation System. The on-line
  documentation consists of both qualification training and evaluation materials. The forms
  that make up the individual’s permanent qualification evaluation records are included in the
  following sections:
  7.2.2. (AFISRA) All intelligence personnel assigned to an intelligence unit (including
  attached or gained personnel), IAW applicable AFI 14-2(MDS) volumes and this instruction,
  as supplemented, must have an evaluation folder, which includes all AF Forms 4350 and AF
  Forms 4349 that make up the individual’s permanent qualification evaluation records.
     7.2.2.1. AF Form 4349 Section. This section contains AF Forms 4349, MAJCOM
     required items and those items authorized by the unit in written guidance (e.g., logs of
     initial and annual reviews). AF Forms 4349 should be on top of this section, in
     chronological order with the most recent on top.
     7.2.2.2. AF Form 4350 Section. This section contains AF Forms 4350 for all evaluations
     listed on the AF Forms 4349 Section. File AF Forms 4350 in chronological order with
     the most recent on top.
     7.2.2.3. Memos for Record (MFR) Section. MFRs documenting waivers, extensions and
     major discrepancies relating to qualification are filed in chronological order and are
     linked with AF Forms 4349.
     7.2.2.4. (Added-AFISRA) EFs will be maintained by the unit stan/eval function on all
     assigned and attached personnel holding an MDS, weapon system or intelligence function
     and activity certification.
     7.2.2.5. (Added-AFISRA) HHQ intelligence personnel on active intelligence crew or
     activity status may have their EFs maintained by the HHQ Stan/Eval function or by the
     stan/eval function at which they maintain a qualification.
     7.2.2.6. (Added-AFISRA) The EF for intelligence personnel in inactive status, non-AFI
     14-2(MDS)v2 AFISRA assignment or assigned or attached to other than AFISRA
     Intelligence Units will be maintained IAW with this instruction, as supplemented (see
     paragraph 7.6.1.3 (Added)).
     7.2.2.7. (Added-AFISRA) Individuals assigned or attached to other than AFISRA
     Intelligence Units may use the format of the service or agency of the unit of attachment to
     document their history of intelligence qualification/certification.
  7.2.3. Gradesheets. While gradesheets are used during qualification, recurring, and
  specialized qualification evaluations, they do not become part of the individual’s permanent
 56                                     AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010


   evaluation record. Gradesheets are discarded or turned over to the individual after the AF
   Form 4350 has been accomplished.
7.3. Review of Qualification Training and Evaluation Records.
7.3. (AFISRA) Review of Qualification EF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish
an initial review and how to implement the periodic review of EFs in the unit supplement to this
instruction.
   7.3.1. Initial Review. The unit will review the records for all newly assigned intelligence
   personnel to identify previous training and qualifications. The reviewing organization is
   responsible for establishing the currency and qualification of the intelligence specialist as
   determined from the latest applicable documentation. Following determination of the
   currency and qualification of the intelligence specialist, the unit maintaining the record is
   responsible only for documentation subsequently placed in the record.
   7.3.1. (AFISRA) Units will review the EF for all newly assigned intelligence members to
   establish their currency and qualification prior to the intelligence member performing any
   AFI 14-2(MDS) intelligence activity related duties or participating in any AFI 14-2(MDS)
   operational missions.
       7.3.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing
       the currency and qualification of the intelligence personnel as determined from the latest
       applicable documentation in Sections I and II of the EF. Following determination of the
       currency and qualification of the intelligence personnel, the unit maintaining the EF is
       responsible only for documentation subsequently placed in the EF.
       7.3.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) If the EF of HHQ personnel in an active intelligence duty
       status is maintained by the stan/eval function at their assigned stations, that stan/eval
       function will also review the EF prior to the member performing any AFI 14-2(MDS)
       intelligence related duty or participating in an AFI 14-2(MDS) operational mission.
   7.3.2. Annual Review. As a minimum, the Intelligence Stan/Eval function will review each
   individual’s record annually (manually or via a report generated by the on-line
   documentation system) for expiration dates of required evaluations.
   7.3.2. (AFISRA) The Stan/Eval function will review all unit EFs to confirm expiration
   dates used to track required intelligence personnel qualification evaluations are the same as
   those listed in the EFs. Annual review of EFs for personnel in inactive status is not required.
   Documentation of reviews will be outlined in the unit supplement.
       7.3.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) Posting Review. The Stan/Eval function will review each
       AF Form 4350, AFISRA Form 402, or AFISRA Form 403 when they are placed in the
       EF to ensure accuracy and completeness. This review will confirm that the eligibility
       period and qualification as documented are correct, all required task evaluation events
       were accomplished and requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and
       that the AF Form 4350 contains all signatures and initials within allotted time. AFISRA
       Forms 402 or 403 will be reviewed for correct certification signature and to ensure all
       previous entries are accounted for and are accurate. Posting reviews may also serve as
       annual reviews when all provisions in paragraph 7.3.2 are met. Documentation of posting
       reviews will be outlined in the unit supplement.
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                    57


     7.3.2.2. (Added-AFISRA) EF Discrepancies. EF Discrepancies include those of the AF
     Forms 4349, AF Form 4350, AFISRA Form 402, and AFISRA Form 403.
         7.3.2.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) Categories of Discrepancies.            Discrepancies   are
         categorized by their impact on qualification/certification.
         7.3.2.2.2. (Added-AFISRA) Discrepancies that alter the qualification/certification
         of the affected intelligence member are considered major.
         7.3.2.2.3. (Added-AFISRA) Those discrepancies that do not alter the
         qualification/certification of the affected intelligence member are considered minor
         and include typos, formatting and misspellings.
     7.3.2.3. (Added-AFISRA) Major Discrepancies Disposition. Identified major
     discrepancies are documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section I or II immediately
     above the affected AF Form 4350 (certification certificate), or in chronological order
     with the AF Forms 4350 and any AFISRA Forms 402 or 403 for items other than those
     found on AF Forms 4350 or AFISRA Forms 402 or 403. Any MFR created to document
     late evaluations, GP/CC waivers, etc. is removed from the EF once the information is
     incorporated onto the completed affected AF Form 4350 under Evaluator Remarks
     paragraph D, Additional Comments. Memos for Record become a permanent part of the
     EF only when the major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected
     by a later AF Form 4350.
     7.3.2.4. (Added-AFISRA) Minor Discrepancies Disposition. Minor discrepancies are
     documented on a non-permanent record as defined by the unit supplement to this
     instruction.
         7.3.2.4.1. (Added-AFISRA) The record of minor discrepancies is to be used to
         ensure standardization of AF Forms 4349, AF Forms 4350, AFISRA Forms 402 or
         403, and intelligence member EFs.
  7.3.3. Corrections.
     7.3.3.1. AF Forms 4350. As source documents, AF Forms 4350 may be corrected by use
     of an electronic correction form in the on-line documentation system provided the
     intelligence evaluator who signed the AF Form 4350 verifies the change.
     7.3.3.1. (AFISRA) The AF Form 4350 may be corrected by use of white-out/over-print
     or pen and ink alteration of the original document provided the intelligence evaluator
     signing Section III of the form initials the correction. Units should use discretion when
     applying this rule. For only minor discrepancies, that does not alter or put into question
     the qualification, documentation on a minor discrepancies log is the preferred method.
     For significant alterations and corrections, which alter the qualification, re-accomplish
     the AF Form 4350 if all signatories are available or document on a Major Discrepancies
     memorandum.
     7.3.3.2. AF Forms 4349. AF Forms 4349, not being source documents, may be altered
     without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected member and the contents of
     AF Form 4350 Section.
     7.3.3.2. (AFISRA) AF Forms 4349, not being source documents, may be altered
     without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected intelligence member and the
58                                     AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010


     contents of Section II of the EF. However, content must be legible, standardized and
     professional in appearance.
     7.3.3.3. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA Form 403. As a source document, the AFISRA
     Form 403 may be corrected by use of white-out/over-print or pen and ink alteration of the
     original document provided the certifying official signing that line of the AFISRA Form
     403 initials the correction. For significant corrections, which alter the certification’s
     intent, make a new AFISRA Form 403 entry.
     7.3.3.4. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA Form 402. As a source document, the AFISRA
     Form 402 may be corrected by use of white-out/over-print or pen and ink alteration of the
     original document provided the certifying official signing that line of the AFISRA Form
     402 initials the correction. For significant corrections, which alter the certification’s
     intent, make a new AFISRA Form 402 entry.
  7.3.4. Transfer of Qualification Training and Evaluation Record. When custody of the
  record is transferred to a new unit or base, the losing unit will ensure the record is properly
  archived in the on-line documentation system for the gaining unit’s retrieval. The
  qualification training and evaluation records for personnel in inactive status or not serving
  with an Air Force intelligence operational mission will be stored on the on-line
  documentation system in a dormant status. Individuals should retain an electronic back-up
  copy of their records during their inactive status.
  7.3.4. (AFISRA) Transfer of EF. When custody of the EF is transferred to a new unit or
  base:
     7.3.4.1. (Added-AFISRA) Retention of Records. Retain all records in the folder until
     reviewed by the gaining unit. After review, return to the individual those forms not
     retained in the folder.

                                          Chapter 8

                                ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS

8.1. Intelligence Read File (IRF).
   8.1.1. Purpose. The purpose of the IRF is to provide a central repository for messages and
   directives of a temporary nature directly pertinent to the conduct of intelligence operations.
   These materials are designated by the MAJCOM/A2 and SIO to be read by all assigned
   intelligence personnel.
   8.1.2. Unit Intelligence Stan/Eval Responsibilities. Unit intelligence organizations will
   establish and maintain an IRF according to MAJCOM directives. The Unit Intelligence
   Stan/Eval function will maintain all Intelligence Stan/Eval guidance (e.g., appointment
   letters, Intelligence Stan/Eval Operating Instructions and applicable AFIs) and ensure they
   are current and complete.
   8.1.3. IRF Organization. Units will establish and maintain a table of contents for the IRF
   containing, as a minimum, a listing of the AFI 14-202 series and the applicable MAJCOM
   supplements and the applicable MDS-specific instructions (i.e. AFI 14-2(MDS)v1-3). The
   IRF will consist of a minimum of four volumes and may be printed or electronic materials or
   a mixture of both. Label electronic tabs and/or binders on the spine indicating Volume and
   Title as follows:

Table 8.1. IRF Volume Titles.
Volume                                           Title
Volume I                                         Current Read File
Volume II                                        Air Force Instructions/Directives/MAJCOM
                                                 Supplements
Volume III                                       MAJCOM/NAF/Local Directives
Volume IV                                        AFTTP 3-1 Volume 2/AFTTP 3-1 MDS-
                                                 specific Volume(as
                                                 applicable)/Manuals/Checklists
   8.1.3. (AFISRA) Volume I is a table of contents for all volumes and current read file items,
   Volumes II through IV are made up of publications and manuals, and Volume V (optional) is
   reserved for safety information. If units choose hardcopy format and the contents of any
   volume exceed the capacity of its binder, use an additional binder and identify the first and
   subsequent binders by a letter and/or number of sequence (e.g., IIIA, IIIB; II-1, II-2). At
   GP/CC’s discretion, the IRF library may be electronic, provided measures are in place to
   ensure currency of publications and unrestricted access by unit intelligence personnel. Units
   will prepare to support deployed forces with appropriate IRF information. Units will develop
   a deployment plan to successfully transfer timely IRF information to deployed intelligence
   personnel supporting operations. Units utilizing electronic media will ensure backup copies
   of IRF Volumes I and II (paper or electronic) are maintained in case of connectivity
   problems, external power supply problems, or unit deployment/field conditions.

Volume                      Title
Volume V                    Safety Information (Optional)
      8.1.3.1. The Current Read File will consist of information directed by the MAJCOM,
      HHQ, and the unit SIO.
      8.1.3.1. (AFISRA) Wing/Center/Group agencies desiring to insert information into the
      IRF will submit the information to unit Stan/Eval for coordination and distribution
      (Volume V excluded). Items entered into Volume I will be limited to those items that
      contain information temporary in nature. To prevent overwhelming intelligence personnel
      with unnecessary details, salient points may be extracted from lengthy documents or
      highlighted if inclusion in Volume I is necessary. Above the Wing/Center/Group level,
      the MAJCOM Stan/Eval function is the focal point for all IRF information. Volume I
      will be divided into three parts:
         8.1.3.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) Part A is a table of contents listing all material
         contained in IRF Volumes I through V.
         8.1.3.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) Part B is the Current Read File of temporary messages.
         Messages contain information temporary in nature, directly pertinent to critical or
         safe conduct of intelligence operations, missions and/or functions, such as Mission
         Control Notes (MCN) and must be read before performing intelligence duties and
         functions and/or participating on operational missions.
             8.1.3.1.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) Part B will contain messages instituting revisions
             to mission procedures that directly affect safe conduct and security of intelligence
             missions or activities. MAJCOM directed IRF items for Part B, other than
             AFISRA/A3 directed items, will be approved by the applicable MAJCOM/A2 and
             coordinated through HQ AFISRA Stan/Eval for AFISRA units, NGB/A2I for
             ANG units, and HQ AFRC/A2V for AFRC units.
                8.1.3.1.2.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) Part B items will be on an AFISRA/A3V
                approved form or contain, as a minimum, an issue date, a Stan/Eval-issued
                control number, subject, submitter or authority and termination date. Note:
                The subject should match the originating message subject. The Go/No-Go box
                will be checked for all Part B items or the item must contain as the first line of
                text ―Go/No-Go Y/N: Y‖ (This will indicate an item required to be read
                before performing intelligence duties and functions and/or participating on
                operational missions). Units will review items for applicability in conjunction
                with the AFISRA quarterly message. The most current list of active IRF items
                can be viewed at the AFISRA Stan/Eval website.
                8.1.3.1.2.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) Items in Part B will be numbered with two-
                digit year and sequential order (i.e., 09-02) and filed in reverse numerical
                sequence with the latest item on top. Classified entries will be cross-
                referenced to the appropriate location. Part B may be indexed and divided by
                MDS, weapon system or intelligence function and activity. A chronological
                log of all Part B contents will be the first item in Part B or index(s) if divided.
                If unit IRF database is contained on an unclassified net and a classified Part B

            information temporary in nature but not related to the safe conduct and security of
            intelligence missions or activities and not required to be read before performing
            intelligence duties and functions and/or participating on operational missions.
               8.1.3.1.2.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) Part C will contain current operational and
               mission guidance of a non-critical/non-safety of intelligence operations
               nature. Items in Part C will be numbered with two-digit year and sequential
               order (i.e., 09-02) and filed in reverse numerical sequence with the latest item
               on top. Part C may be indexed and divided by MDS, weapon system or
               intelligence function and activity. A chronological log of all Part C contents
               will be the first item in Part C or index(s) if divided. If unit IRF database is
               contained on an unclassified net and a classified Part C message is issued, the
               IRF will cross reference the specific location where intelligence personnel can
               review classified message.
               8.1.3.1.2.2.2. (Added-AFISRA) At a minimum, ARC units will document
               review of IRF Part C monthly, in conjunction with the unit UTA.

                                        Attachment 3
                RECOMMENDING CHANGES TO AF PUBLICATIONS

A3.1. General. The Intelligence Stan/Eval function is responsible for the orderly and efficient
processing of recommended changes to Air Force publications at each command level. Unless
different guidance is provided by the appropriate AF publication OPR, submit recommended
changes and improvements to Air Force publications on AF Form 847 according to the
procedures below. Submit recommended changes for conditions that have negative effects on
operational efficiency, to correct content errors or to recommend improved procedures or
processes. Do not use the AF Form 847 to call attention to typographical, printing or quality
errors unless they cause misinterpretation. Such deficiencies can be remedied by direct
communication with the AF publication OPR.
A3.2. Processing AF Forms 847.
   A3.2.1. Submit and process all AF Forms 847 through MAJCOM channels as outlined in the
   MAJCOM supplement to this instruction, in accordance with routing as outlined in Figure
   A6.1.. ANG units will utilize the NAF/MAJCOM command structure with oversight
   responsibility. Units will submit AF Form 847s electronically to the maximum extent
   possible.
   A3.2.2. At each level the Intelligence Stan/Eval function will document receipt of original
   AF Forms 847, ensure the AF Form 847 reaches the appropriate functional OPR at that level
   for review, forward approved original AF Forms 847 to the next command level while
   informing the preceding command level of disposition (positive and negative) with
   comments. The advent of electronic Forms 847 may allow each level to inform all levels
   below (including the originator) of such disposition. The goal is to keep each command level
   and the originator advised of the progress and disposition of a submitted AF Form 847.
   A3.2.3. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will forward the reviewed original AF Form
   847 to the AF publication OPR. Once the AF publication OPR decides on disposition of the

FROM: 497ISRG/CC

SUBJECT: Stan/Eval and Training Review Board (STRB) for SrA John L. Example

1. An STRB was convened on 6 Aug 2009 to determine the cause of SrA Example’s evaluation
failure.

2. The panel consisted of the following individuals:

      Lt Col Masters         - 30IS Commander
      Maj Gaffney            - 30IS Operations Officer
      2Lt Young              - 30IS Flight CC
      MSgt Blacksmith        - 497ISRG Chief, Stan/Eval
      MSgt Jones             - 30IS Chief, Operations Training
      SSgt Marks             - Intelligence Evaluator
      TSgt White             - Examinee’s Instructor
      TSgt Holden            - Examinee's Supervisor
      SrA Example            - Examinee
3. Background:

   a. Name and Category: SrA John L. Example 30IS GSQ-272/GA
   b. History:
       (1) Dec 08 – INIT QUAL (Q1)
       (2) 2 Feb 09 - Entered into MQT
       (3) 8 May 09 - Mission Progress Check performed by TSgt White. Closed book
   progress check score – 63% / Open book progress check score – 30%.
       (4) 8 Jun 09 - Evaluation date of 30 Jun 09 was established.
       (5) 1 Jul 09 - SrA Example failed his Closed Book examination and scored a 45%.
       (6) 14 Jul 09- SrA Example failed his Closed Book examination and scored a 75%. His
   training records indicated that he was not signed off on all of the tasks required for MQT.
       (7) 20 Aug 09- An STRB was conducted to discuss the causes and possible solutions of
   SrA Example's initial and second failure. The panel agreed that there were two primary
   causes: (1) SrA Example's well-documented lack of self-motivation towards training, and (2)
   a lack of supervised study.

4. Circumstances surrounding the failure: SrA Example failed to satisfactorily pass his Closed
Book examination on his INIT QUAL.
AFI14-202V2_AFISRASUP_I 22 NOVEMBER 2010                                                       113


5. Test Scores: Closed Book – 45/75%; Open Book – 80%. MSgt Blacksmith read the above
information to the panel. The following panel discussion took place with SrA Example:

6. STRB Discussion:
    a. SSgt Marks briefed the board on the results of this evaluation. SSgt Marks pointed out
that had it not been for the below minimum test scores on the written tests, SrA Example may
have passed this evaluation, since his system and mission performance is excellent.
    b. The lack of immediate supervisor interaction was also addressed by the members, noting
that SrA Example’s supervisor, TSgt Holden, had a TDY schedule that was very nearly opposite
that of SrA Example. It was also noted that TSgt Holden, however, did not review SrA
Example’s training as often as needed and that the Flight CC did not oversee SrA Example’s
training during TSgt Holden’s absences.

7. Observations: The board determined that there were two primary causes that contributed to
this evaluation failure:
    a. Lack of self-motivation on SrA Example’s part with regard to his academic training
progression.
    b. Lack of training supervisory continuity during his training. There was no primary
academic Instructor assigned to SrA Example.

8. Recommendations:
    a. The board recommended that SrA Example be placed on mandatory 1.5 hours of
supervised study each day, including weekends. During this supervised study, he will work with
TSgt Holden to the greatest extent possible. MSgt Teacher will sit in on these training sessions
as needed.
    b. TSgt Holden will be restricted from TDYs during the remedial period in order provide
appropriate supervisory oversight and involvement each day, including weekends.
    c. It is the determination of this board that SrA Example will follow the above plan and be
given an additional 30 days to prepare for his evaluation. This evaluation will take place no later
than 7 Sep 09.

A12.1. (AFISRA) IE Objectivity Grading Criteria. The following grading criteria will be
used by IEs when conducting IE Objectivity Evaluations. Awarding a ―Q-― with corrective
training or a ―U‖ in any of the areas will result in a Q-3 for the overall grade for the specialized
crew position. Cumulative deviations will be considered when determining the overall rating of
either ―1‖ or ―3.‖

Table A12.1. Grading Criteria.
AREA 1 – COMPLIANCE WITH STAN/EVAL DIRECTIVES
Q             Complied with all directives pertaining to the administration of the evaluation.

              checklists, task scenario cards, evaluation profiles, product check checklists, and
              publications. Adhered to required Go/No-Go criteria. Read and reviewed required
              IRF documents.
Q-            Complied with most directives. Utilized/possessed most required forms.
              Deviations did not jeopardize the effectiveness of the evaluation or mission
              safety.
U             Failed to comply with directives or possess required forms/documents, which
              could possibly have jeopardized mission safety. Did not adhere to Go/No-Go
              criteria. Did not read/ review IRF documents prior to conducting the evaluation.
AREA 2 – IE’S BRIEFING
Q             Briefed the examinee on the conduct of the evaluation, mission requirements,
              responsibilities, grading criteria, and evaluator actions/position during the
              evaluation. Covered tasks to be evaluated and the standard for performance for
              the task. Utilized unit checklists as guidelines for performance standards.
              Detailed which tasks may need to be simulated and how/when the simulation will
              occur. Explained which products will be generated. Provided the examinee with
              Product Check Checklists for required products. Pointed out which tasks are
              critical. Delineated the flow of the evaluation.
Q-            Items were omitted during the briefing causing minor confusion. Did not fully
              brief the examinee as to the conduct and purpose of the evaluation.
U             IE failed to adequately brief the examinee.
AREA 3 – IDENTIFICATION OF DISCREPANCIES AND ASSIGNMENT OF AREA
GRADES

             achieve proper level of qualification.
U            Failed to assign additional training when warranted.
AREA 6 – MISSION DEBRIEF
Q            Debriefed the examinee on all aspects of the evaluation, within 24 hours of the
             completion of the evaluation. Debrief included all key mission events, providing
             instruction and references as required. Reconstructing the mission in
             chronological order, covering all tasks evaluated, what operations/actions the
             examinee took, any discrepancy for the task, the grading criteria area the task fell
             into, any additional training for the task. Specified how and to whom examinee
             would demonstrate task proficiency for those tasks/grading criteria areas in which
             additional training was assigned. Detailed grades for each grading area and the
             overall evaluation grade.
Q-           Failed to discuss all deviations and assigned grades. Did not advise the examinee
             of additional training, if required. Failed to debrief or adequately reconstruct all

AFISRA FORM 403, CERTIFICATION OF INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL TRAINING

A13.1. (AFISRA) AFISRA Form 403, Certification of Intelligence Personnel
Training. Optional, unless directed by HQ AFISRA. When used comply with the following
guidance when completing an AFISRA Form 403. Special certifications may be documented
IAW AFI 14-2(MDS)v1 on AFISRA Form 403, AFISRA Form 402 (see paragraph A14.) or
locally created training folder trackers. IE certifications will be signed by the SQ/CC or GP/CC.
See Attachment 8 for sample AFISRA Form 403.
A13.2. (AFISRA) Purpose. The AFISRA Form 403 provides a permanent record/certification
source for intelligence personnel certifications not attained through an AF Form 4350
qualification. (Units may use a AFISRA agency approved a unit certification document signed
by an authorized official. An authorized official for a unit certification document will be an
official authorized to approve an AF Form 4350, or another appropriate authority designated in
writing by this official.)
   A13.2.1. (AFISRA) Maintain a separate AFISRA Form 403 in the EF, Section I,
   documenting certifications by individual assigned unit and primary MDS, intelligence
   system, function and/or activity (Activity). For intelligence personnel with multiple
   intelligence Activities certifications attained through difference training, only one AFISRA
   Form 403 is required; specify the primary mission MDS, intelligence system, function or
   Activity designation. File AF Forms 403 in chronological order with the most recent on top.
   Note: May also be filed in an intelligence personnel member’s permanent training folder, as
   a training completion document. When AFISRA Form 403 is used as a training completion
   document, refer to AFI 14-202, Volume 1, as supplemented, for guidance.
   A13.2.2. (AFISRA) Unit stan/eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications
   for intelligence personnel assigned/attached to their unit to indicate a chronological history of
   certifications of intelligence personnel while assigned/attached to their unit.
       A13.2.2.1. (AFISRA) The AFISRA Form 403 will document all certifications attained
       in previous and current MDS(s), intelligence system(s), function(s) and/or Activity(s).
       Retain as a historical source document. File AF Forms 403 in chronological order with
       the most recent on top.
       A13.2.2.2. (AFISRA) During the initial review of individual EF, also review AFISRA
       Form 403 entries in the intelligence personnel’s training folder to determine applicable
       certifications of new assigned/attached intelligence personnel. Document intelligence
       personnel certifications as specified by the assigned/attached unit commander on a new
       AFISRA Form 403.
           A13.2.2.2.1. (AFISRA) The IGV/DOV Chief or other individual designated by the
           squadron commander will sign a one line entry below all other entries signifying
           acceptance of those events listed above (see paragraph A13.7 for documentation
           requirements).
       A13.2.2.3. (AFISRA) AFI 14-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement will specify
       AFISRA Form 403 certifying officials, IAW paragraph A13.4.3
