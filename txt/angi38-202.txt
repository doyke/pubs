SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Changes include but
are not limited to changes to the Enlisted Grades Council guidance and implementation.
1. Introduction. This paragraph provides general information on the ANG Enlisted Grades
Program’s objectives and major program participants.
 2                                                                 ANGI38-202 30 March 2011


     1.1. Program Objectives.    The ANG Enlisted Grades Program is designed to meet the
     following objectives:
        1.1.1. Ensure compliance with established grade percentages.
            1.1.1.1. Provide a method/procedure that will equitably distribute enlisted grades
            throughout all ANG field level units.
            1.1.1.2. Provide Directorate Enlisted Grades Council representatives/Career Field
            Functional Managers (CFFMs) the authority to allocate grades in their Air Force
            Specialties (AFSs) they represent.
     1.2. Enlisted Grades Council (EGC). The council will convene and review the enlisted
     grade structure every two years. The Director, Air National Guard can direct an enlisted
     grade review at any time deemed necessary. The major participants in the ANG Grades
     Program are: ANG Command Chief, CFFMs, EGC representatives, a representative from the
     ANG Manpower Office and the Enlisted Field Advisory Council (EFAC) representatives.
     The responsibilities for each of these participants are as follows:
        1.2.1. ANG Command Chief. Responsible for ensuring compliance with this instruction.
        Chairs the EGC and presents recommendations to the DANG.
            1.2.1.1. CFFMs. Regardless of the Program Element Code (PEC), responsible for
            coordinating AFS(s) with Functional Area Managers (FAMs) and ensuring the grades
            allocations and distribution process supports mission requirements and career
            progression within their AFS(s). Conducts a review of the AFS/career fields and
            determines distribution while maintaining a zero within-grade balance of the total
            grades allocated for their AFS(s).
            1.2.1.2. EGC representatives. A Chief Master Sergeant Representative is assigned
            by each A Staff and Special Staff Director (per attachment 1). These representatives
            are responsible for the overall grades structure of all AFS(s) within their areas and
            represent the ANG corporate process on enlisted grades.
            1.2.1.3. ANG Manpower, Organization and Resources Division.                 Manpower
            administers the ANG Enlisted Grades Program and co-chairs the EGC. This is
            accomplished by ensuring the program parameters and percentage constraints are
            established and in compliance. Manpower maintains and provides the ANG Enlisted
            Grades data. Baseline data for this process is current end of fiscal year data from the
            manpower database. Manpower will schedule the council meetings. Manpower is
            also responsible for accurately reflecting and maintaining enlisted grades in the
            manpower data system.
            1.2.1.4. Enlisted Field Advisory Council (EFAC). EFAC will provide three
            representatives for the EGC. These members represent the voice of the field in the
            ANG corporate process on enlisted grades.
2. Enlisted Grade Percentages and Allocation Process.
     2.1. ANG Enlisted Grade Percentages. The percentages are the cornerstones of the ANG
     Enlisted Grades Program and are applicable to all ANG field level units. They are
     defendable to Air Staff, are not to be exceeded and are a percentage of total ANG funded
     enlisted end-strength numbers.

       2.1.1. CMSgt 2%
       2.1.2. SMSgt 5%
       2.1.3. MSgt 18.5%
       2.1.4. TSgt 25.5%
       2.1.5. SSgt 49%
Note: The percentages are applicable to all enlisted grades included in funded military end-
strength numbers, except organizations, AFS(s), Special Duty Identifiers or Reporting Identifiers
identified in advance by the ANG Command Chief or Director, Air National Guard.
   2.2. ANG Enlisted Grades Allocation Process. The first foundational rule will be to apply
   the percentages established in paragraph 2.1. The second criteria will be to ensure no Unit
   Type Code (UTC) was broken after applying the percentages. The final rule is all
   disconnects will be identified and brought to the EGC for resolution.
       2.2.1. Any out of cycle grade requests that exceed the percentages and will cause a
       disconnect must be coordinated with the EGC.
3. Implementation. CFFMs/EGCs will work with manpower to revise the Unit Manpower
Document (UMD) to reflect the grade changes generated by the ANG Enlisted Grades
Allocation Process.
