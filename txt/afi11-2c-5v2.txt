1.8. Evaluations. This instruction establishes standardized instrument, qualification, mission,
and instructor evaluation criteria. It also establishes the areas/subareas necessary for the
successful completion of evaluations and identifies those required areas/subareas which are
considered critical or non-critical.
1.9. Evaluation Requirements. Accomplish evaluations concurrently whenever practical.
Crew resource management (CRM) skills will be evaluated on all evaluations. C-5 aircrew
members will complete the following evaluations at 17-month frequency IAW AFI 11-202V2
and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement:
     1.9.1. Instrument (INSTM) Evaluation. All C-5 pilots will successfully complete a periodic
     instrument evaluation including the requisite instrument refresher course (IRC) and open-
     book written instrument examination according to AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher
     Course Program, and an aircrew training device (ATD) or flight evaluation.
     1.9.2. Qualification (QUAL) Evaluation. All C-5 crew members will successfully complete a
     periodic qualification evaluation including the requisite open-book, closed-book, and
     boldface written examinations, emergency procedures evaluation (EPE), and ATD/flight
     evaluation.
        1.9.2.1. The C-5 weapon systems trainer (WST) may be used in conjunction with all
        qualification/ mission, instrument, and emergency procedures evaluations. Perform
        evaluations in an approved simulator with an Air Force flight examiner (not a contractor).
        Evaluations will consist of all areas that can be realistically accomplished and are ATD
        creditable per AFI 11-2C-5V1, C-5 Aircrew Training. NOTE: Air refueling contacts will
        be evaluated in the airplane.
     1.9.3. Mission (MSN) Evaluation. All C-5 crewmembers will complete a mission evaluation.
     Crew members complete all tasks required in the performance of normal operations and
     training sorties during a combined QUAL/MSN evaluation. Additional mission evaluations
     may be required for en route, air refueling (AR), air refueling instructor pilot (ARIP) and
     night vision goggle (NVG). See specific aircrew chapters for additional mission evaluation
AFI11-2C-5V2 26 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 7


  requirements. Additional mission evaluations should be as realistic as possible with a
  minimum of simulated events.
  1.9.4. Instructor (INSTR) Evaluation. To initially qualify as an instructor in the C-5, aircrew
  members will successfully complete the appropriate initial instructor course and evaluation
  (see AFI 11-2C-5V1 for course requirements). Crew members will not normally receive
  their initial instructor evaluation in conjunction with the periodic INSTM/QUAL/MSN
  evaluations; however, subsequent evaluations may be combined, and instructors will be
  evaluated on their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations. Crew members may re-
  align their initial instructor evaluation with the periodic INSTM/ QUAL/MSN evaluation;
  see specific aircrew chapter for requirements.
  1.9.5. SPOT Evaluations. A SPOT is a type of evaluation not intended to satisfy the
  requirements of a periodic (i.e., INSTM, QUAL, MSN, or INSTR) evaluation. SPOT
  evaluations have no specific requisites or requirements unless specified in MAJCOM
  supplements or as specified in this AFI. See AFI 11-202V2 for options available to convert a
  SPOT evaluation to QUAL/MSN to meet periodic evaluation requirements.
  1.9.6. Requalification (RQ). Use the prefix RQ when the evaluation is remedy for loss of
  qualification.
  1.9.7. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). See AFI 11-202V2 and the following:
  Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of emergency procedures and systems knowledge
  for all initial, re-qualification and periodic qualification evaluations. The EPE will include
  areas commensurate with the examinee’s crew qualification. See below and specific aircrew
  chapters of this AFI for additional EPE requirements.
     1.9.7.1. Unit will develop and periodically maintain a list of EPE program requirements
     (topics, special interest, etc.) in Chapter 6. The EPE will include areas commensurate
     with the examinee’s graduated training (e.g., initial, line, instructor or evaluator) or as
     specified in AFI 11-202V2 and MAJCOM supplement.
     1.9.7.2. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in flight. The
     examinee must be able to recite all boldface items from memory and provide the initial
     steps of selected emergency procedures that would not allow time for reference.
     1.9.7.3. Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified will be placed in
     supervised status until recommended additional training and re-evaluation are completed.
     Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified because of unsatisfactory
     boldface procedures will not be permitted to fly in their aircrew position until a
     successful re-evaluation is accomplished. Accomplish additional training IAW AFI 11-
     202V2.
  1.9.8. Evaluation Prefixes. Use AFI 11-202V2 evaluation prefixes for AF Form 8,
  Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, and AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation.
     1.9.8.1. Identify unique mission type evaluation descriptions in parenthesis (e.g. MSN
     (AR), MSN (ARIP), MSN (NVG)). Use the same annotation on the AF Form 942,
     Record of Evaluation.
     1.9.8.2. Difference Evaluations. The phrase ―difference‖ is used to describe the
     evaluation of one or more areas to meet qualification requirements. Normally, a
 8                                                       AFI11-2C-5V2 26 SEPTEMBER 2011


        difference evaluation will include areas that are different between aircraft models,
        systems, or operations not previously qualified to operate. A difference evaluation does
        not have expiration date established because the evaluation does not satisfy the
        requirements for the ―full‖ periodic evaluation. Specific aspects of difference evaluations
        are more fully explained in the following sections of this instruction describing individual
        aircrew member qualification requirements.
            1.9.8.2.1. For administrative purposes, annotate AF Form 8, flight phase as a SPOT
            evaluation (according to AFI 11-202V2) and paragraph 1.9.5. above.
1.10. Grading Policies.
     1.10.1. The overall qualification level awarded an evaluation is based on performance during
     both the flight and ground phases. This grade should be awarded only after all evaluation
     requirements have been completed and given due consideration.
     1.10.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the aircrew member must satisfy the
     criteria set forth for that evaluation and demonstrate ability to operate the aircraft and/or
     equipment safely and effectively during all phases of an evaluation.
     1.10.3. Use the grading criteria in this instruction and the MTL/ESD to grade areas
     accomplished during an evaluation.
        1.10.3.1. The flight examiner must grade the areas listed as ―required‖ in the general and
        specific evaluation sections of this instruction.
        1.10.3.2. The flight examiner may grade any area accomplished during an evaluation if
        performance in that area impacts the specific evaluation requirements or flight safety.
     1.10.4. When the evaluation occurs in an airplane and it is not possible to complete the
     evaluation of a required area, the area may be evaluated in an ATD or verbally evaluated.
     Flight examiners will make every effort to evaluate all required areas in the airplane before
     resorting to this provision. See the appropriate chapter for areas prohibited from verbal/ ATD
     evaluation.
     1.10.5. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions. Minor
     momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective
     action and such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider cumulative deviations
     when determining the overall grade.
        1.10.5.1. If the flight manual recommends a specific airspeed range for performance of a
        maneuver, the flight examiner will apply the grading criteria to the upper and lower limits
        of that range (pilots only).
        1.10.5.2. Flight examiners will use the grading criteria in this instruction and the
        MTL/ESD to assist in determining proper grades, not to replace flight examiner
        judgement.
1.11. Grading System. NOTE: This paragraph for reference only and duplicates information in
AFI 11-202V2 to allow the evaluator a single source instruction to conduct an evaluation. When
a conflict occurs, use AFI 11-202V2.
     1.11.1. Overall Qualification Levels.
AFI11-2C-5V2 26 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               9


     1.11.1.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The aircrew member demonstrated desired
     performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment, and directives within tolerances
     specified in this instruction. Qualification Level 1 will be awarded when no discrepancies
     were noted and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
        1.11.1.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no lower than a ―Q-‖ grade being given in
        any area(s)/subarea(s).
        1.11.1.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
        awarding of an overall Q-1.
        1.11.1.1.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during the
        debrief of that evaluation.
     1.11.1.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to
     perform duties safely, but:
        1.11.1.2.1. There was one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
        assigned.
        1.11.1.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of ―U‖ was awarded.
        1.11.1.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based on
        performance in one or more areas/subareas.
     1.11.1.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The aircrew member demonstrated an
     unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge.
        1.11.1.3.1. An area grade of ―U‖ awarded in a critical area requires an overall ―Q-3‖
        for the evaluation.
        1.11.1.3.2. An overall ―Q-3‖ can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight
        examiner, there is justification based on performance in one or more areas/subareas.
     1.11.1.4. The flight examiner will indicate all appropriate restriction(s) and additional
     training on the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
  1.11.2. Area/Subarea Grades. Areas will have a two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U)
  grading system. The overall area grade will be the lowest of any subarea grade awarded.
     1.11.2.1. A ―Q‖ is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a
     satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within the
     prescribed tolerances and accomplished the assigned mission.
     1.11.2.2. A ―Q-‖ indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area tasks,
     but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight examiner.
     Deviations from established standards must not exceed the prescribed ―Q-‖ tolerances or
     jeopardize flight safety.
     1.11.2.3. Assign a ―U‖ area grade for any breach of flight discipline, performance
     outside allowable parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that
     adversely affected mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee
     receiving an area grade of ―U‖ normally requires additional training. When, in the
     judgment of the flight examiner, additional training will not constructively improve
 10                                                      AFI11-2C-5V2 26 SEPTEMBER 2011


       examinee’s performance, it is not required.        In this case, the flight examiner must
       thoroughly debrief the examinee.
   1.11.3. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew
   member in order to successfully achieve the mission objectives. If an aircrew member
   receives an unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will
   also be unqualified. Critical areas are identified by ―(Critical)‖ in the areas’ title and shading
   of Q- block on the AF Form 3862, Air-crew Evaluation Worksheet (see examples at
   Attachment 2, Attachment 3, and Attachment 4).
1.12. Unsatisfactory Performance. NOTE: This paragraph for reference only and duplicates
information in AFI 11-202V2, allowing the evaluator a single-source instruction for critical
phases of the evaluation. When a conflict occurs, use AFI 11-202V2.
   1.12.1. Conduct a thorough pre-mission briefing and post-mission debriefing to the
   examinee and applicable aircrew members on all aspects of the evaluation.
   1.12.2. Immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline. When an examinee
   jeopardizes safety of flight, the evaluator may assume the duties of that aircrew member.
   This does not mean the flight examiner must assume the examinee’s position any time
   unsatisfactory performance is observed.
   1.12.3. Assign a qualification level of ―Q-3‖ for unsatisfactory performance in any critical
   area/subarea or if the flight examiner assumes the examinee’s duties.
   1.12.4. Immediately notify the examinee’s squadron commander/operations officer and
   flight commander, if available, when less than Q-1 performance is observed.
   1.12.5. Unsatisfactory performance in a non-critical area/subarea will result in no higher
   than a qualification level ―Q-2‖.
   1.12.6. Flight examiners observing unsatisfactory performance by a crewmember other than
   the examinee (including one in a different crew position) will comply with the requirements
   in AFI 11-202V2.
1.13. Conduct of Evaluations.
   1.13.1. Flight examiners will pre-brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose and
   requirements of the evaluation, and all applicable evaluation criteria. Flight examiners will
   then evaluate the examinee in each graded area/subarea.
       1.13.1.1. Flight examiners should not evaluate personnel they have primarily trained,
       recommended for upgrade evaluation, or who render their effectiveness/performance
       reports.
   1.13.2. Unless otherwise specified, flight examiners may conduct the evaluation in any crew
   position/ seat that will best enable the flight examiner to observe the examinee’s
   performance. If occupying a primary crew position, the evaluator will perform all duties
   required of that position (e.g., mandatory advisory calls, etc.).
   1.13.3. Note discrepancies and deviations from prescribed tolerances and performance
   criteria during the evaluation. Compare the examinee’s performance with the tolerances
   provided in the grading criteria and assign an appropriate grade for each area.
AFI11-2C-5V2 26 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  11


       1.13.3.1. An evaluation will not be changed to a training mission to avoid documenting
       substandard performance, nor will a training mission be changed to an evaluation.
       1.13.3.2. The judgment of the flight examiner, guidance provided in AFI 11-202V2, and
       this instruction will be the determining factors in assigning an overall grade. The flight
       examiner will thoroughly critique all aspects of the flight. During the critique, the flight
       examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area/subarea
       grades assigned, and any additional training required.
       1.13.3.3. In the event of unsatisfactory performance, the flight examiner will determine
       additional training requirements. Normally, additional training should not be
       accomplished on the same flight. EXCEPTION: Additional training on the same flight is
       allowed when unique situations presenting valuable training opportunities (e.g.,
       thunderstorm avoidance, crosswind landings, etc.) exist. This option requires the utmost
       flight examiner discretion and judicious application. When used, the examinee must be
       informed of when the additional training begins and ends.
       1.13.3.4. When evaluations are less than Q-1 performance, the flight examiner will
       debrief the examinee and examinee’s commander or supervisor. Notify the operations
       officer, flight commander/chief and examinee’s supervisor as soon as possible
1.13.4. The ATD may be used to accomplish additional training and rechecks. Areas for
additional training and rechecks should be limited to those areas that can be realistically
accomplished in the ATD.
   1.13.5. The flight examiner who administered the original evaluation should not normally
   administer the recheck.
1.14. Use of the AF Form 3862 Flight Evaluation Worksheet. Units (normally OGV) will
overprint the Flight Evaluation Worksheet using the examples in Attachment 2, Attachment 3, or
Attachment 4. Copy each title, area number and text (in the order illustrated), and shading to the
appropriate blocks. Units may add special interest items and/or local evaluation requirements.
Use the worksheet in flight to ensure all required areas are evaluated. Record positive and
negative trend information and aircrew member performance. The examiner completing the
evaluation will sign and date the worksheet. File the worksheet or the signed and dated draft
copy of the AF Form 8 in the aircrew member’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) immediately
after the flight evaluation as a temporary record of the evaluation results. Remove the temporary
evaluation record when the permanent AF Form 8 is filed in the FEF.
1.15. Aircrew Testing. See specific testing requirements in AFI 11-202V2 and include the
following:
   1.15.1. Formal training unit end-of-course (EOC) examinations may be credited toward
   written examination requirements provided they are administered as part of a formal syllabus
   and a passing score of 85 percent is attained. Individuals who do not receive a passing score
   of 85 percent will be required to complete the unit’s open and closed book examinations.
   1.15.2. Open Book Exam (Open Book). Conduct an open book exam consisting of 60 to 100
   questions. A portion of the open book exam will include questions pertaining to each mission
   qualification and or certification held by the examinee (e.g., instructor, AR, NVG, AMP, and
   Tactics). See crew member chapters for additional testing requirement (if specified).
 12                                                   AFI11-2C-5V2 26 SEPTEMBER 2011


   1.15.3. Closed Book Exam (Closed Book). The closed book examination should be
   administered before the initial (see EOC examination above) flight evaluation and
   subsequently with periodic flight evaluations. The closed book exam will consist of a
   minimum of 20 questions derived from the Master Question File (MQF). Complete a
   boldface exam in conjunction with the closed book exam, if applicable. See crew member
   chapters for additional testing requirements (if specified). HQ AMC/ A3VX will manage the
   C-5 MQF.
   1.15.4. Instructor Open Book Exam (INIT INSTR Open Book). Complete EOC instructor
   examination, or if not available, conduct an INIT INSTR open book examination. The exam
   will be a minimum 20 questions derived from AFMAN 36-2236, Guidebook for Air Force
   Instructors, AFI 11-2C-5V1, AFI 11-2C-5V3, this AFI, and other applicable sources. The
   questions will be specific to instructor duties and scenario-based.
       1.15.4.1. Subsequent (Periodic) Instructor Examinations.        Include scenario-based
       instructor questions in the open book examination.
   1.15.5. Instrument Exam (Pilots only). See AFI 11-202V2 instrument requirements.
   Document the exam completion on AF Form 8 as INSTRUMENT, date completed, and the
   appropriate score.
1.16. Equivalent C-5 Model Aircraft. The C-5A/B and C-5A (SCM) models are considered
equivalent MDS’s for the purpose of aircrew member qualification. Crew members operating
Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) modified aircraft require a separate certification IAW
AFI 11-2C-5V1. The C-5M modified aircraft requires a separate qualification evaluation profile
(exception loadmasters see paragraph 1.16.3).
   1.16.1. Multiple C-5 Model Certification. Accomplish differences/certification training IAW
   AFI 11-2C-5V1, C-5 Aircrew Training. A periodic evaluation may be accomplished in any
   C-5 aircraft model in which the individual is certified.
       1.16.1.1. Loadmasters. Loadmasters assigned to units equipped with C-5A/B, C-5A
       (SCM), and/or C-5M modified aircraft will receive differences training IAW AFI 11-2C-
       5V1, C-5 Aircrew Training, and will be certified to operate those aircraft. Loadmasters
       may retain all prior model certifications regardless of current unit equipped aircraft.
   1.16.2. Multiple C-5 Qualification. The C-5M is a different MDS than C-5A/B and C-5A
   (SCM) for pilot and flight engineer qualification. Initial and periodic evaluations must be
   accomplished in both model aircraft.
1.17. Typical C-5 Evaluation Profile(s). The unit will determine the evaluation profile(s)
suitable for in-flight evaluations with unit OG/OGV approval (approval of the units’ flying
schedule satisfies this requirement). See specific aircrew chapters for en route, NVG, AMP, and
Tactics mission profile requirements.
1.18. Senior Officer Requirements. Senior Officers meeting the criteria outlined in AFI 11-
202V1, may complete a C-5 Senior Officer qualification evaluation. Requisites include open and
closed book examinations, instrument examination, Boldface, and EPE. The evaluation shall be
accomplished from the left seat. Evaluate appropriate areas in GENERAL, QUALIFICATION,
and INSTRUMENT. The evaluation should consist of a variety of instrument approaches and
VFR patterns. Abnormal configuration, simulated engine-out, right seat, and Cat II approach and
AFI11-2C-5V2 26 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               13


landings are not required. Annotate the AF Form 8 as a QUAL/INSTM evaluation with an
expiration date, crew position ―FP‖, and include a restriction in the comment section, ―fly only
under the direct supervision of a qualified C-5 Instructor Pilot.‖ See AFI 11-202V1, Senior
Officer Qualification and Performance Requirement, for additional information.

                                   PILOT EVALUATIONS

2.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic, and re-qualification evaluations,
including requirements for pilot instrument, qualification, mission, and instructor evaluations.
2.2. Instrument Evaluations. Normally conduct C-5 instrument evaluations in conjunction
with qualification evaluations.
2.3. Qualification/Mission Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Requalification). Include all
areas under GENERAL, QUALIFICATION/MISSION, INSTRUMENT, and TACTICS, and
appropriate written examinations.
   2.3.1. Evaluator Notes:
       2.3.1.1. Graduates of the C-5 Initial Qualification Aircraft Commander and Mobility
       Pilot Development Courses will be evaluated on all maneuvers to include simulated
       engine-out, no flap landings, and Cat II ILS approaches.
       2.3.1.2. Item 16, ―Landing Roll / Braking / Reverse Thrust‖ must be evaluated during a
       full stop landing.
       2.3.1.3. PAR may be evaluated in the ATD or verbally if not available in flight.
       2.3.1.4. Aircraft commanders and pilots accomplish Cat II ILS approaches and landings
       from the left seat. EXCEPTION: Instructors and examiners may be evaluated from the
       right seat. Initial instrument/ qualification evaluations require demonstration of a missed
       approach and a landing. Subsequent evaluations require one approach to either a missed
       approach or landing.
       2.3.1.5. Two non-precision approaches should be evaluated; one is flown as a straight-in,
       the other as a circling approach. Only one non-precision approach (circling) is required if
       tactical approaches are evaluated.
       2.3.1.6. Evaluate pilots on at least one instrument approach and landing in both left and
       right seats. EXCEPTION: Instructor and examiners need only be evaluated from one seat.
       2.3.1.7. Evaluate either a rectangular or overhead VFR pattern. Not required if tactical
       maneuvers are evaluated.
       2.3.1.8. Tactically certified pilots will be evaluated in all areas under TACTICS during
       all QUAL evaluations. Evaluate both a high and low approach. If weather conditions
       preclude the high approach, a second low approach will be substituted or the high
       approach will be evaluated in the WST.
       2.3.1.9. Tactical (Combat) Mission Planning and general knowledge will be evaluated
       during testing. However both AFTTP 3-1 and 3-3 knowledge will also be sampled during
       the flight evaluation. It is recommended that basic Air Force Mission Support System
       (AFMSS)/Personal Flight Planning System (PFPS) procedures be sampled.
       2.3.1.10. Maneuvers not accomplished in the aircraft due to weather, maintenance, etc.
       may be completed in the WST. See paragraph 1.9.2.1.
AFI11-2C-5V2 26 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  15


       2.3.1.11. An all Engine Go-Around (Area 17) is not required when an Engine Out Go-
       Around (Area 19) is accomplished.
2.4. Additional Mission Evaluations.
   2.4.1. Air Refueling (AR). All initial, periodic and re-qualification evaluations will include
   all areas under GENERAL and AIR REFUELING. AR may also be evaluated in conjunction
   with a QUALIFICATION/MISSION/INSTRUMENT evaluation.
       2.4.1.1. If evaluating a pilot for only A/R qualification, annotate AF Form 8 as a MSN
       (AR) evaluation.
       2.4.1.2. Rendezvous or closure from a minimum of 1 NM is required. Pilots will
       demonstrate sustained contacts with tanker autopilot on and off and a practice emergency
       separation. Evaluate pilots in left seat. Evaluate instructors in either seat. Manual boom
       latching and overrun procedures may be evaluated verbally.
   2.4.2. AMP. Pilots completing the AMP differences training course will accomplish a flight
   evaluation in either the WST or airplane including the areas under GENERAL and
   QUALIFICATION/MISSION. Annotate the evaluation as ―SPOT‖ on the AF Form 8 and
   include the following statement in the remarks section, ―This flight evaluation was conducted
   in conjunction with C-5 AMP certification.‖ Pilots that complete all requisites may elect to
   reset their QUAL/INST/MSN clock by completing all areas under GENERAL,
   QUALIFICATION/MISSION, INSTRUMENT, TACTICS, and appropriate written
   examinations.
   2.4.3. . Operational Mission Evaluation (OME). All pilots not previously certified to operate
   the C-5 in command will receive a one time OME prior to aircraft commander certification.
   The evaluation profile is at the discretion of the OG/CC.
       2.4.3.1. . The suggested profile is at least two mission legs, takeoff, arrival, landing,
       tactical maneuvers (if applicable) and a crew rest. One leg should be flown over a
       Category I route with different departure and arrival locations.
       2.4.3.2. Annotate AF Form 8 as a SPOT evaluation and enter ―This operational mission
       evaluation was conducted in conjunction with aircraft commander certification‖ in the
       remarks section.
2.5. Instructor Evaluations (Initial, Periodic, or Requalification). Flight examiners will
place particular emphasis on the examinee’s ability to recognize student difficulties and provide
timely, effective corrective action. As a minimum, demonstrate and instruct a variety of
instrument/visual approaches (instruct a minimum of one approach and landing flown by another
pilot). Conduct initial or re-qualification instructor evaluations with a qualified pilot occupying
the other seat. The examinee will normally occupy the right seat.
   2.5.1. Include (as a minimum) all areas under GENERAL, QUALIFICATION/MISSION
   (see paragraph 2.3.1.), AIR REFUELING (for A/R IP evaluations only), and INSTRUCTOR.
       2.5.1.1. Pilots who desire to realign the INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation expiration date
       during the initial (or requalification) instructor evaluation must also demonstrate all
       required areas/subareas in ―INSTRUMENT‖ and written examinations.
 16                                                      AFI11-2C-5V2 26 SEPTEMBER 2011


           2.5.1.1.1. Pilots receiving an Initial or Requal Instructor Evaluation in the aircraft are
           not required to be evaluated on Engine Out Operations, to include Engine Out Go
           Arounds and Approaches.
       2.5.1.2. Initial instructor AR evaluations will include a boom limits demonstration from
       the right seat. Annotate the AF Form 8 with ―INIT MSN (ARIP)‖ and add the following
       comment, ―This evaluation fulfills the requirements of the MSN (AR) evaluation.‖
       Subsequent recurring MSN evaluations for air refueling instructor pilots will be
       annotated as ―MSN (AR)‖ and will include all areas under AIR REFUELING and
       INSTRUCTOR. Additionally, the remarks section will contain comments on the specific
       areas of instruction, e.g. ―Maj Smith provided excellent instruction throughout the
       rendezvous.‖
   2.5.2. Periodic instructor evaluations will be administered in conjunction                   with
   qualification/instrument evaluations in accordance with paragraphs 2.2. and 2.3.
2.6. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). Pilots will accomplish the EPE in an ATD,
during the preflight briefing, during the flight evaluation, or any combination of these.
2.7. Additional Information.
   2.7.1. Evaluators may conduct evaluations when scheduled as primary aircrew members.
   2.7.2. Instructor and flight examiner pilots receiving periodic evaluations may be evaluated
   in either seat, but are not required to be evaluated in both.
2.8. Pilot Grading Criteria.
2.9. General. Area 1, Directives and Publications.
