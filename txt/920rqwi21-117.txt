     3.2. Keys for CTKs and equipment will have the same TCMax CTK number etched on the
     key or will be attached to a spring ring, spring clip or common key ring that has the TCMax
     CTK number affixed to the spring ring, spring clip or common key ring. CTKs will use a key
     lock, combination padlocks are not permitted. Built-in locks on roll around CTKs are
     permitted.

     Support Section only and will be issued through TAS.
4. Identification:
     4.1. To identify items tracked in Tool Accountability System units will use a standard nine-
     digit Worldwide Identification Code (WWID) as the Equipment Identification Designator
     (EID).
     4.2. The first three positions of the 920 RQW WWID are “U19.” The fourth character is
     designated as the owning shop.

7. Operating Stock and Consumable Items:
   7.1. Spare bulbs will not be stored in flashlights
8. AMX Support Procedures:
   8.1. The AMXS Tool Room is normally staffed Monday - Friday and on Unit Training
   Assembly (UTA) weekends. When the need exist that tools need to be signed-out after
   normal hours, for example, during support of night flying missions, scheduled or
   unscheduled maintenance, etc., the following procedures apply.
   8.2. The supervisor on duty will assign a qualified/trained individual that has been
   designated in writing, to staff the Tool Room and issue/turn-in tools using the TCMax system
   or AFRC Form 177, Consolidated Tool Kit and Inventory Log. The individual assigned to
   issue/turn-in tools after normal duty hours will not issue/turn-in tools to themselves. It is the
   responsibility of the supervisor/ senior technician to ensure that all items issued during the
   shift are accounted for and signed in at end of shift.
   8.3. All Aircraft Maintenance Squadron tools and equipment dispatched to an aircraft not
   undergoing an Isochronical (C-130) or periodic (H-60) inspection, whether in the hangar or
   on the flight line, must be signed-out from the Tool Room. If a specific tool is required (on a
   recurring basis) for on-aircraft maintenance but the tool is not located in the Tool Room, it
   can be signed-out from the owning workcenter using their TCMax or if the TCMax system is
 4                                                        920RQWI21-117 22 OCTOBER 2012


     not operational, on a AFRC Form 177, Consolidated Tool Kit Inventory and Control Log or
     AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt. This requirement will be relayed to the Tool
     Room Supervisor, AMXS Superintendent and the individual’s supervisor, so the tool can be
     ordered and stocked. The TCMax will be used to manage all tools, equipment, rags, technical
     orders, vehicle keys (for vehicles assigned to 920 MXG), and hazardous materials stored in
     the Tool Room.
     8.4. CTKs and equipment are not normally transferred at the job site. If necessary to do so,
     both individuals accomplish an inventory. The gaining individual notifies the Tool Room
     attendant that he/she is now responsible for the item(s). The Tool Room attendant will then
     turn-in the item(s) in TCMax, and reissue the item(s) to the gaining individual. All items
     signed-out of the Tool Room should normally be turned in by 1530 each workday. If
     workload dictates that personnel keep items checked-out past normal duty hours, they must
     notify the Tool Room attendant. Personnel must complete an inventory before leaving for
     the day, and all items signed-out must be secured.
     8.5. For 920MXG one person shops, aircraft dispatchable tools and equipment will be stored
     in the AMXS Support Section for issue/turn in. The owning work center is responsible for
     inspections, maintenance and documentation of AF Form 244 for these items.
9. Lost Tool/Object Procedures:
     9.1. A TAS generated product (form) or AFRC Form 174, Lost Tool/Object Report is
     completed for each lost tool/object unless the item is immediately recovered. The CTK
     custodian will maintain a copy of AFRC Form 174 on suspense and will provide QA with the
     original for control log purposes. Destroy suspense report when it has been on file for 1 year.
     Segregate copies “recovered” and “not recovered”.
     9.2. The person issued the CTK/equipment must search the immediate work area for the
     item. After a thorough search, immediately initiate an AFRC Form 174. The wing FOD NCO
     or MXG/MXQ will issue a control number for the lost tool/object report. The squadron
     maintenance officer/superintendent or production supervisor ensures a thorough search is
     conducted to include utilizing x-ray, borescope, and other state of the art equipment to locate
     tools/objects in inaccessible areas if required.
     9.3. If an item is missing after on aircraft/equipment maintenance, the Maintenance
     Operations Center (MOC) and QA will be informed. The MOC will notify 920 MXG/CC or
     his/her representative of the missing tool immediately if it is mission impacting (any delay in
     launch sequence i.e.: preflight, end of runway, take-off time, etc.). If non-mission impacting
     the 920 MXG/CC or their representative will be notified immediately unless loss occurs after
     2300 hours local; then notify within the first hour of the next duty day.
     9.4. The Quality Assurance Section ensures that an AFRC Form 174 tracking log is
     maintained to control and track all lost tool reports for the unit.
     9.5. If the item is not recovered, place a Red X in the aircraft or equipment forms of all
     affected aircraft or equipment with a description of the tool and a specific, last known
     location of the tool. A copy of the completed report is given to QA/Wing FOD NCO. There
     will be an entry in the forms upon notification of the missing tool. Ref: AFI 21-101,
     paragraph 10.8.
920RQWI21-117 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                                   5


  9.6. QA will segregate completed AFRC Form 174, “recovered” and “not recovered.” These
  forms will be maintained on file for 1 year.
  9.7. Limit authorization to clear red X’s for lost tools to no lower than Operations
  Officer/MX SUPT.
  9.8. Lost Tool/Object Procedures for Taxied Aircraft:
     9.8.1. If a tool or object is discovered missing and the affected aircraft have taxied, the
     following procedures to hold or recall the aircraft are followed:
         9.8.1.1. The person making the discovery will immediately notify the MOC through
         the most expedient means possible. Additional notifications are made to the expediter
         or work center supervisor, and the maintenance officer/supervisor on duty.
         9.8.1.2. The MOC notifies the Command Post. The Command Post/squadron
         operations center instructs the aircrew to return to the parking spot. If the aircraft is
         airborne at the time of notification, the aircraft is directed to return to base with
         minimal maneuvering.
         9.8.1.3. Once aircraft has landed initiate Lost Tool/Object investigation report.
  9.9. The Maintenance Squadron Superintendent (MXM) or Aircraft Maintenance Squadron
  Superintendent (MXA) will ensure the AFRC Form 174 is completed in a timely manner and
  will maintain a file of completed forms for trend history.
