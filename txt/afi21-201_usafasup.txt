Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management, 11
December 2009, Incorporating Change 1, 25 February 2011 is supplemented as follows:
This supplement applies to all United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) personnel. This
supplement describes United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) procedures for use in
conjunction with the basic AFI. This publication does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC) Units and the Air National Guard (ANG). Refer recommended changes and conflicts
between this and other publications to 10 LRS/LGRMS, 8110 Security Drive, Door #14, USAF
Academy CO 80840, on Air Force Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
Ensure all records created because of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, located at
www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. See Attachment 1 for a glossary of references
and supporting information. Note: A civilian defense contractor administers the Munitions
Management Operation at the USAF Academy; therefore, their manning is not determined by a
Unit Manpower Document (UMD) but established by the contractor based upon the Statement of
Work (SOW) provided by the Government. The contractor is required to follow guidance
established in AFI 21-201 for specific tasks identified in the SOW; however, the SOW specifies
Munitions Accountable Systems Officer (MASO) requirements for contract acceptance factors.
