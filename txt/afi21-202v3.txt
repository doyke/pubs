                                            Chapter 1

   SPACELIFT MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY AND GUIDANCE

1.1. Introduction.
   1.1.1. This Instruction prescribes specific spacelift maintenance guidance and procedures to
   be used throughout the USAF and provides senior leadership and management direction for
   the accomplishment of this mission. This AFI applies to SL maintenance management and
   mission assurance functions. Spacelift is different from traditional missile maintenance
   mission areas in that it is a hybrid mission involving aspects of acquisition, operations, and
   maintenance expertise.
   1.1.2. Due to the nature of SL, where individual rocket components are physically mated and
   electrically connected for the first time at the launch base, launch site operations and
   maintenance operate in an acquisitions environment as the last stop on the factory floor,
   where there is significant assembly and testing occurring in the weeks and months preceding
   launch.
1.2. Related Guidance. AFI 21-200, Munitions and Missile Maintenance Management
contains general information to support Air Force munitions and missile maintenance and
provides broad responsibilities for these organizations. AFI 21-202v3, Spacelift Maintenance
and Mission Assurance has incorporated all pertinent requirements from AFI 21-200 and is the
capstone document for Spacelift maintenance management defining organizational structure and
related roles and responsibilities.
1.3. Supervision of Maintenance. All levels of supervision must place emphasis on safety,
security, quality, and timeliness in the performance of maintenance.
1.4. Spacelift and Equipment Readiness. Spacelift and equipment readiness is the
maintenance mission. Maintenance ensures assigned, spacelift and support equipment remains
safe, serviceable and properly configured to meet mission needs. Maintenance actions include,
but are not limited to, certification, inspection, repair, overhaul, modification, preservation,
refurbishment, testing, and analyzing condition and performance.
1.5. Critical Ground Support Equipment, Facilities and Infrastructure. Critical Ground
Support Equipment (GSE), facilities and infrastructure are those ground systems at the launch
base that are necessary for the proper launch or safing of the flight hardware. Their location can
vary from umbilical cables and fixed structures co-located at the launch complex that physically
support the rocket or supply it with commodities to geographically distant pipelines or power
systems that supply critical services.
   1.5.1. These systems are separate from range systems necessary for the launch, termination,
   or tracking of all rockets and missiles during flight. Range Maintenance Squadrons at each
   Space Wing maintain the ranges according to guidelines in other documents.
   1.5.2. Critical infrastructure outside the fence of contractor-leased facilities such as pipelines
   or electrical distribution systems will be maintained by the appropriate wing agency.
   1.5.3. Critical GSE, facilities and infrastructure also includes facilities for storing,
   processing, or commanding flight hardware.
 6                                                           AFI21-202V3 13 JANUARY 2012


     1.5.4. Responsibility for maintenance of contractor-leased/licensed critical infrastructure
     resides with the contractor. Oversight of contractor-leased/licensed facilities at the launch
     bases will be provided by the Launch Group (LCG) via applicable Letters of Assignment
     (LoA) or Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) between the Program Office and the launch
     base.
1.6. Preventive Maintenance. The purpose of the entire maintenance process is to sustain the
capability to support operational mission requirements. To accomplish this objective, the
primary focus of the maintenance effort should be on preventive rather than corrective
maintenance. Preventive (or scheduled) maintenance ensures equipment is ready and available
at the time of need. A conscientious and disciplined approach to preventive maintenance will be
the method used to meet that goal safely and effectively. Preventive maintenance concepts are
described in T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation,
Polices, and Procedures.
1.7. Mission Assurance (MA). MA is an integrated engineering-level assessment of analysis,
production, verification, validation, operation, maintenance, and problem resolution processes
performed over the lifecycle of a program by which an operator/user determines that there is an
acceptable level of risk to employment of a system or end item to deliver an intended capability
in an intended environment. The objective of the assurance process is to identify and mitigate
design, production, and test deficiencies that could impact mission success. MA is achieved
through integrated developmental processes and/or independent technical assessment and
requires expenditures commensurate with the criticality of the mission and the consequences of
failure.
1.8. Use of Technical Orders (T. O.), Supplements, Contractor Procedures and Local
Procedures. Use of the prescribed technical data to maintain spacelift systems and associated
equipment is mandatory. For spacelift and satellite processing, contractor procedures for
contractor-controlled/owned hardware and software govern mission assurance and maintenance
actions.
     1.8.1. Supervisors will:
        1.8.1.1. Strictly enforce adherence to and compliance with T.O’s, supplements, local
        procedures, and contractor procedures.
        1.8.1.2. Ensure availability of required T.O’s, supplements, local procedures, and
        contractor procedures.
            1.8.1.2.1. Ensure all applicable T.O’s are part of unit Technical Order Distribution
            Office (TODO) account in order to receive all updates, changes and revisions.
     1.8.2. All personnel will:
        1.8.2.1. Recommend improvements or corrections for T.O. deficiencies IAW T.O. 00-5-
        1, AF Technical Order System. Official T.O. updates are the only valid authority for
        correcting a technical deficiency and implementing change.
        1.8.2.2. Continually assess the currency, adequacy, availability, and condition of T.O’s
        and supplements.
AFI21-202V3 13 JANUARY 2012                                                                      7


   1.8.3. Ensure T.O. files are current and maintained IAW T.O. 00-5-1. Technical data can
   only be released outside USAF channels IAW T.O. 00-5-19, Security Assistance Technical
   Order Program.
       1.8.3.1. Ensure only the minimum quantities of each T.O. are maintained to meet
       mission requirements.
       1.8.3.2. Ensure actions are taken to add or delete T.O’s as required.
   1.8.4. Ensure the appropriate Air Logistics Center (ALC) technical content manager is
   contacted to obtain information/specifications when technical orders do not provide enough
   detail.
   1.8.5. 1st Air and Space Test Squadron (1 ASTS) Local Procedures.
       1.8.5.1. Local Procedures required to accomplish the assigned mission when no technical
       data exists will be developed IAW T.O. 00-5-1 and MAJCOM supplement, as required to
       conduct Spacelift mission assurance/maintenance as requested by the appropriate
       program office.
       1.8.5.2. Local Procedures will be adhered to and complied with in the same manner as
       T.O’s when used.
       1.8.5.3. Local Procedures for maintenance operations will be approved in the following
       manner:
          1.8.5.3.1. Write and update local procedures based upon applicable technical data if
          available or input from subject matter experts or engineers.

AFI21-202V3 13 JANUARY 2012                                                                    31


      6.3.1.1. When performing a PPE, the QA evaluator briefs the individual or team on the
      evaluation and how it will be rated. The PPE may include an evaluation of the
      individual’s training records, tool box, Test Measurement Diagnostic Equipment
      (TMDE) and T.O’s/procedures. The evaluation starts when the individual or team begins
      the task, or portion of the task to be evaluated, and is completed when the job or
      previously determined portion of the task is finished. When performing an evaluation,
      the evaluator determines if the technician or supervisor performed the job IAW technical
      order/procedure and appropriate instructions. Provide feedback to the individual or team
      and supervision upon completion. The types of PEs are:
          6.3.1.1.1. Individual Evaluations. This is a QA over-the-shoulder evaluation of a
          RE/MAT/SMT or supervisor performing a technical/mission assurance task. The
          evaluator may start or stop the task evaluation at any step. PEs may be performed on
          individuals working alone or as part of a team. Evaluations must accurately assess
          the proficiency of each individual under evaluation.
          6.3.1.1.2. Team Evaluations. This is a QA over-the-shoulder evaluation of
          RE/MAT/SMT and supervisors performing a team task. A team task is one requiring
          more than one person to complete the task. The evaluator may start or stop the task
          evaluation at any step.
          6.3.1.1.3. Trainer Proficiency Evaluation (TPE). A TPE will be conducted on each
          section’s designated trainer(s) annually. The TPE is an over-the shoulder evaluation
          of     the     trainer,    performed       while     the     trainer    is    conducting
          qualification/certification/recurring training. A TPE is the direct evaluation of a unit
          instructor/trainer to determine their ability to teach accurately and sufficiently. TPEs
          also assess weapon system, equipment or process knowledge; teaching methods and
          techniques; the ability to operate trainers; and adequacy and effectiveness of training
          program and not the proficiency of the trainees themselves.
          6.3.1.1.4. Evaluator Proficiency Evaluation (EPE).        The Chief of QA, QA
          Superintendent or LCG Superintendent knowledgeable of applicable task
          requirements will perform EPEs on QA evaluators annually. Each QA evaluator
          must pass an EPE prior to performing unsupervised evaluations or inspections.
          Evaluators that fail an EPE, or are overdue their annual EPE, will be restricted from
          performing proficiency evaluations unsupervised. EPEs will be documented on an
          AF Form 2419, Routing and Review of Quality Control Reports, or equivalent, in the
          same manner as other PEs. EPEs must be tracked in the MIS or Lead Command
          approved QA database.
      6.3.1.2. Rating Proficiency Evaluations.      QA rates each evaluation based on
      AQLs/standards. A failed PE rating means the specific task was not performed within
      the established AQL/standards. The rating applies only to the specific task evaluated and
      not to other tasks that a RE/MAT/SMT or supervisor is qualified to perform. Upon
      completion of an unsatisfactory evaluation, the evaluator must provide on-the-spot
      feedback. Determine ratings IAW Table 6.2.
6.4. General Proficiency Evaluation Guidelines:
 32                                                          AFI21-202V3 13 JANUARY 2012


   6.4.1. Quality Assurance evaluators must be qualified on the hands on maintenance CFETP
   tasks they evaluate (e.g. 1 ASTS).
   6.4.2. To the maximum extent possible, before conducting a PPE, EPE, or a TPE, verify the
   RE/MAT/SMT /instructor is certified in the CFETP to perform/instruct the
   maintenance/mission assurance task.
   6.4.3. Whenever possible, evaluators will have their own copy of technical order/procedure
   available for the task being evaluated.
   6.4.4. Consider using no-notice evaluations whenever possible. QA will attempt to
   minimize impacts on operational maintenance/mission assurance while scheduling
   evaluations.
   6.4.5. Quality Assurance may perform evaluations on personnel utilizing trainers or training
   facilities.
   6.4.6. Evaluators will not be part of the task being performed.
6.5. Guidelines for Conducting Proficiency Evaluations:
   6.5.1. Evaluators must afford reasonable opportunity for maintenance technicians to detect a
   defect or deficiency.
   6.5.2. Evaluation will be accomplished only while observing actual task performance or
   inspecting equipment or documentation.
   6.5.3. Evaluators will brief all personnel to be evaluated prior to the start of the evaluation.
   If a task is already in progress, notify the individuals being evaluated that they are under
   evaluation and brief them as soon as possible. During the briefing, the evaluator must advise
   the technicians of the following:
      6.5.3.1. Don't compromise safety or security.
      6.5.3.2. Under normal circumstances, do not consider the evaluator as the second person
      to satisfy buddy care requirements.
      6.5.3.3. Take breaks during the evaluation, if needed.
      6.5.3.4. The evaluator must be notified of any policy, procedure, configuration changes,
      simulations or previously accomplished steps affecting the evaluation. Errors may be
      assessed for TO/procedure requirements that are omitted during task performance that
      have not been identified as previously accomplished.
      6.5.3.5. The Air Force RE/MAT/SMT is responsible for tasks and related actions. All
      reports, forms, parts requisition, technical orders, contractor data/procedures, tools, test,
      and handling equipment availability, or any other task related actions are responsibilities
      of the individuals evaluated. The evaluator's presence does not shift this responsibility.
      6.5.3.6. The Air Force RE/MAT/SMT /team may ask for technical help from
      personnel/agencies normally available in the conduct of day-to-day maintenance/mission
      assurance activities. The evaluator conducting the evaluation should be asked only as a
      last resort and when all other avenues of help have been exhausted. Excessive outside
      intervention that demonstrates a lack of technical/task proficiency to the degree that the
AFI21-202V3 13 JANUARY 2012                                                                   33


     task cannot be completed without direct supervisory involvement may result in the task
     being rated unsatisfactory.
     6.5.3.7. The evaluator must be notified of the start and completion of the task, and any
     delays that occur.
     6.5.3.8. Evaluator may ask questions to determine the individual’s knowledge of the task
     under evaluation. Questions of this type should be deferred to the end of the operation.
     Individuals may refer to technical guidance or use their normal supervisory chain of
     command when answering questions.
     6.5.3.9. Evaluators will stop a task immediately if conditions are detected that would
     jeopardize personnel or safety, security, system reliability, and/or cause equipment
     damage.
     6.5.3.10. All actions performed are subject to observation.
  6.5.4. Following the evaluation, the evaluator must critique the technicians on the portion of
  the task they were evaluated on. The evaluator must inform the work center supervisor when
  a task is rated unsatisfactory or the results have not been determined.
     6.5.4.1. Explain each error; include who received it, category, mission impact and
     correct procedures.
     6.5.4.2. Review the Air Force RE/MAT/SMT’s/instructor’s strengths and weaknesses.
     6.5.4.3. Recommend methods of task accomplishment.
     6.5.4.4. Exchange ideas and techniques.
  6.5.5. During the TPE briefing, the evaluator must advise the instructor of the following
  additional items:
     6.5.5.1. The instructor must prevent/immediately correct any of the following:
     significant security violations or safety errors which could result in serious injury to
     personnel, failure to use technical orders/procedures during the maintenance/mission
     assurance process and any error which could result in potential/imminent equipment
     damage.
     6.5.5.2. The instructor must correct other errors before completing the training session.
     The training session is considered complete when the instructor critiques the student’s
     performance.
     6.5.5.3. Evaluators will consider the instructor’s degree of control over the trainee.
     6.5.5.4. Evaluators will not generate an evaluation report on the trainees. Errors
     committed by JQS qualified Air Force RE/FIM/MAT/SMT s during activities performed
     outside the scope of the training objective may be documented.
     6.5.5.5. The evaluator may ask questions to determine the evaluatee’s knowledge of a
     task. The evaluatee may use technical references to answer any questions.
     6.5.5.6. The instructor must complete all applicable training documentation and make it
     available for the evaluator’s review.
 34                                                            AFI21-202V3 13 JANUARY 2012


       6.5.5.7. A TPE will be rated unsatisfactory when the trainer does not detect, correct, or
       provide retraining for an error committed that is described in Table 6.3. Additionally,
       the evaluation will also be rated a fail if an incomplete training process takes place.
       6.5.5.8. During task evaluation; the evaluator must detect and correct all errors. Select
       the best option available to correct the situation. It may be advantageous to correct minor
       errors during the critique phase; other errors may warrant prompt correction. Consider
       giving RE/FIM/MAT/SMT (s) the opportunity to make decisions on courses of action on
       their own using the resources available to them.
       6.5.5.9. For each error, conduct training to the level necessary to ensure the technician
       understands the circumstances in question. The evaluator may be prohibited from
       conducting training by time, resources, attitudes or a combination of factors. If
       prohibited, note the situation in the report and defer the required training action to the
       section Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC). The evaluator may recommend
       the RE/FIM/MAT/SMT should not perform the task until retrained.
   6.5.6. Apply the following guidelines when an Air Force RE/MAT/SMT cannot correctly or
   safely do or observe a task without excessive outside intervention or assistance:
       6.5.6.1. Notify the Air Force RE/MAT/SMT’s work center and SQ CC/Superintendent
       (SUPT).
       6.5.6.2. Quality Assurance and the Air Force RE/MAT/SMT's SQ CC/SUPT will assess
       whether to:
           6.5.6.2.1. Replace the technician(s) on the spot.
           6.5.6.2.2. Supervise the Air Force RE/MAT/SMT(s) finishing the task.
           6.5.6.2.3. Terminate the task.
       6.5.6.3. Do not allow the Air Force RE/MAT/SMT(s) to perform the task in question
       unless supervised by a task-qualified technician or until retrained.
       6.5.6.4. State in the evaluation report the technician(s) should not perform the
       maintenance/mission assurance task unsupervised or until retrained. Quality Assurance
       may state the Air Force RE/MAT/SMT should not perform any maintenance/mission
       assurance tasks or any maintenance/mission assurance function unsupervised.
   6.5.7. Air Force RE/MAT/SMT /instructors who commit major errors described in Table 6.3
   at anytime during the maintenance process will be rated unsatisfactory.
   6.5.8. Conduct TPEs to verify the technical accuracy and completeness of training. Use
   TPEs to sample both initial qualification and recurring training.
6.6. Quality Verification Inspections. A QVI is an inspection of equipment condition, or a
process, an assessment following an inspection, servicing or repair action, or verification that a
RE/MAT/SMT or supervisor properly completed an inspection or repair action. QVIs shall not
be conducted after equipment operation when such operation could invalidate indications of
proper job accomplishment. Limit QVIs to the technical orders required for the job. Normally
this inspection does not require disassembling parts, removing stress panels or like actions. The
QVI report should reflect deficiencies by the individual who accomplished the task and identify
AFI21-202V3 13 JANUARY 2012                                                                  35


specific discrepancies. Each QVI is chargeable to the technician or supervisor who performed
the work.
6.7. Management Inspections and Special Inspections. Quality Assurance conducts
inspections to provide managers an objective appraisal of mission capability and management
effectiveness. Focus on efficiency, procedural compliance and adequacy of directives.
   6.7.1. Management Inspection. Perform these inspections to follow-up on trends, conduct
   investigations or conduct research to get to the root cause of problems. Group/CC, SQ/CC or
   work center supervisors may request MIs. MIs may encompass trends and other inspection
   data; high component or system failure rates; suspected training deficiencies, and tasks
   outlined in TOs/procedures. Report MI results to the requester, and allow them latitude to
   explore options prior to implementing corrective actions. MIs can be non-rated and may be
   counted in QA trends.
   6.7.2. Special Inspections (SI). SIs are inspections not covered by QVIs, PEs or MIs. SIs
   may include, but are not limited to, aerospace equipment and equipment forms inspections,
   document file inspections, Composite Tool Kits (CTK), T.O. files, vehicle inspections,
   housekeeping, safety practices, etc. SIs may be condition, procedural or compliance
   oriented. The locally developed QA database will be used to document special inspections.
   SIs can be non-rated. If rating a SI, rate them based on locally established AQLs/standards.
   6.7.3. Prior to conducting inspections, determine the scope (what to inspect) and process
   (how to inspect it). Consider the following:
       6.7.3.1. Using formalized checklists.
       6.7.3.2. Basing inspections on regulatory requirements.
       6.7.3.3. Standardizing report content, format, distribution and routing procedures.
6.8. Applicability to Contract Maintenance Activities. QA is not applicable to contract
logistics activities unless required by the Statement of Work (SOW), Performance Work
Statement, or contract (e.g contractor provided training).
6.9. Manning, Training, Qualification and Proficiency.
   6.9.1. Chief of QA will develop a local training plan to train all QA personnel. In this
   section use of QA evaluator includes augmentees.
       6.9.1.1. Training must cover inspection and evaluation techniques, documenting
       inspection worksheets and actions to prevent personnel injury or equipment damage. A
       formal QA evaluator course may be used to supplement this training. Document QA
       evaluator training in individual training records.
       6.9.1.2. QA evaluators are JQS qualified on all SMT tasks they evaluate. For all other
       tasks, evaluators must be familiar with the requirements/procedures of tasks they
       evaluate.
       6.9.1.3. Quality Assurance may need augmentee evaluators for some work centers.
       Ensure qualification on the appropriate SMT technical tasks in the CFETP they will
       evaluate. Permanent augmentees will meet all qualifications required for QA.
 36                                                         AFI21-202V3 13 JANUARY 2012


        6.9.1.4. Evaluator Qualifications: Prior to performing unsupervised evaluator duties,
        personnel selected as evaluators must:
            6.9.1.4.1. Be JQS qualified on the appropriate evaluator CFETP tasks.
            6.9.1.4.2. Complete unit evaluator training program, to include at least one
            proficiency evaluation and one technical inspection.
            6.9.1.4.3. Be observed by Chief of QA, QA Superintendent, or LCG Superintendent
            conducting a PPE or TPE.
            6.9.1.4.4. Be interviewed by Chief of QA and LCG Superintendent.
            6.9.1.4.5. Chief of QA, QA Superintendent, or LCG Superintendent must observe
            each evaluator conducting a PPE or TPE annually, not to exceed 12 months between
            observations.
            6.9.1.4.6. Quality Assurance Augmentation. If a functional area does not warrant a
            full-time position in QA, but specialized expertise is required, select qualified
            personnel that are recommended by their SQ/CCs to be augmentees. Each QA must
            maintain a listing of current augmentees.         In coordination with the SQ
            CCs/superintendents, QA shall establish augmentee duties.
            6.9.1.4.7. Rotation of Quality Assurance Personnel. Personnel should be assigned to
            QA for a maximum of 36 months/minimum of 24 months.

                        TOOL AND EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT

7.1. Tool and Equipment Management. The objectives of the tool and equipment
management program are to prevent and eliminate damage to flight hardware, facilities, and
support equipment, and to reduce costs through strict effective control and accountability of
assets. To ensure standardization among maintenance units, commanders and key leaders are
responsible for executing an effective tool program. Tool and equipment management applies to
all spacelift units.
7.2. Guidelines for Program Management.
   7.2.1. The Unit CC is the OPR for the development of procedures for control and
   management of tools/equipment. As a minimum, guidance will address the following:
   (note: this chapter also applies to spacelift organizations that do not maintain flight line
   assets or dispatch to the flight line)
       7.2.1.1. Standardized procedures for security, control, and accountability (e.g., manual,
       barcode, etc.) of tools and equipment.
       7.2.1.2. Inventory requirements. As a minimum, conduct and document an annual
       inventory of all tools and equipment.
       7.2.1.3. Procedures for warranted tool management.
       7.2.1.4. Procedures for control and management of replacement, expendable and
       consumable hand tools, Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT), and other items contained in
       CTKs.
       7.2.1.5. Procedures for transfer of tools/CTKs at the job site (on-site transfers). CTKs
       are not normally passed from one individual to another at the job site; however, mission
       needs occasionally require this action to occur. Ensure tool accountability and control is
       maintained when transfer occurs between the individuals. As a minimum the individuals
       involved in the transfer will accomplish a joint inventory and document accordingly.
       7.2.1.6. Procedures for lost or missing tools.
       7.2.1.7. Assignment of equipment identification designators (EID) for CTKs, equipment
       not controlled on an equipment account, and assignment of CTK numbers for tools.
       7.2.1.8. Procedures for issue and control of personal protective equipment (e.g., ear
       protectors, reflective belts, headsets). Mark tools or equipment that a work center
       assigns/issues to an individual.
       7.2.1.9. Procedures for control of locally manufactured or developed tools and
       equipment.
       7.2.1.10. Procedures and responsibilities for situations where two or more work centers
       operate a single tool room/support section, or when work centers elect to distribute CTKs
       or peculiar support/test equipment to decentralized locations.
 40                                                         AFI21-202V3 13 JANUARY 2012


      7.2.1.11. Local procedures must as a minimum direct a second party or on-duty
      supervisor inspection of the tool kit. The same individual that signs out a CTK cannot
      sign it back in.
      7.2.1.12. Procedures for controlled access to tool rooms.
7.3. General Program Guidelines.
   7.3.1. Designate CTK Custodians in writing. CTK custodians are responsible for tool,
   HAZMAT, and consumable asset accountability and control.
   7.3.2. Determine the type, size, and number of CTKs required for their work centers.
      7.3.2.1. Maintain a complete listing of all CTKs and tools/equipment issued as a single
      item (e.g., testers, torque wrenches).
   7.3.3. Design CTKs to provide a quick inventory and accountability of tools. Clearly mark
   all CTKs and tools with the EID (follow guidance below). Develop local procedures to
   determine which tools are checked out and who has them. Inspect all tools periodically for
   serviceability IAW T.O. 32-1-101, Use and Care of Hand Tools and Measuring Tools.
      7.3.3.1. CTK contents will be standardized to the maximum extent possible within
      functional elements of a squadron that have similar missions.
      7.3.3.2. Each tool, item of equipment, or consumable contained in a CTK has an
      assigned location identified either by inlay cuts in the shape of the item, shadowed layout,
      or silhouette. No more than one item is stored in a cutout, shadow, or silhouette except
      for tools issued in sets such as drill bits, allen wrenches, apexes, or paired items (e.g.,
      gloves, booties).
   7.3.4. A Master Inventory List (MIL) is required for each tool kit or series of identical kits
   and filed by the CTK custodian in the master MIL file. The MIL remains valid until contents
   change.
      7.3.4.1. A copy of the MIL will be kept in the tool and equipment storage facility at all
      times for inventory purposes. For dispatchable CTKs, a copy of the MIL must be kept
      with the dispatched CTK at all times.
      7.3.4.2. If dog tags/identification tags or similar tags or dust caps are attached to
      tools/equipment, they will be secured in a manner that will preclude any possibility of
      FOD. Locks(s), key(s), and tie down strap(s), if not permanently attached, will be
      marked/etched with the appropriate CTK number. All items are listed on the MIL.
      7.3.4.3. Consumables may be placed in CTKs. If so, they are identified on the MIL as
      consumables. Examples of consumables include safety wire, adhesive, wire bundle
      lacing, solder, etc. Do not include common hardware items such as bolts, nuts, and (or)
      screws unless they are required as tools.
      7.3.4.4. Document removed or broken tools/items on all copies of the MIL. In addition
      to this requirement, units may also document missing or removed tools on a locally
      developed missing/removed tool log (may be automated). The EID will be removed from
      any broken/removed tool/item.
AFI21-202V3 13 JANUARY 2012                                                                     41


   7.3.5. Equipment and accessories that do not present a FOD potential and will not leave the
   work center, support section, or tool room, need not be included in a CTK; however, this
   equipment must have designated storage locations established. Designated locations may be
   work areas or stations (e.g., TMDE flight, avionics flights, propulsion flight, RS/RV
   Maintenance and Inspection Facility).
       7.3.5.1. Establish designated locations for test equipment and common accessories (e.g.,
       waveguides, attenuators, fittings, cables, adapters) that are not part of a CTK.
       7.3.5.2. Industrial shop machinery accessories/attachments (e.g., blades, arbors, chucks,
       gears) need not be controlled as tools; however, these items will be maintained in
       designated storage locations for accountability. As a minimum, storage cabinets/drawers
       will be labeled to identify the contents.
   7.3.6. Discard removable (e.g., slide on) pocket clips from tools when possible (flashlights,
   continuity testers, small screwdrivers, etc.) prior to placement in tool kits. Do not
   disassemble/damage tools for sole purpose of removing clips, rubber switch guards, etc.
   7.3.7. Tools not controlled through CTK procedures are NOT authorized in any maintenance
   area (e.g., mini-mag flashlights, Leathermans, buck knives, etc.). Mark and control
   equipment that a work center assigns/issues to an individual IAW MAJCOM supplements.
   Personally-purchased tools are not authorized.
   7.3.8. Flashlights, lanterns, portable lighting devices and light sources will conform to the
   requirements of T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding
   when used during servicing operations, T.O. 1-1-3, Inspection and Repair of Aircraft Integral
   Tanks and Fuel Cells when used during fuel cell maintenance, and AFMAN 91-201 when
   used in explosive environments.
7.4. Tool Accountability. Flight commanders/chiefs and section NCOICs, through CTK
custodians, are responsible for tool and equipment accountability and control (knowing where
tools are and who has responsibility for them.) When a person signs for a tool or piece of
equipment, they are accountable for the item until it is returned to the tool room and
accountability transfers back to the CTK custodian (through a representative or tool room
employee.
   7.4.1. All units must use Tool Accountability System (TAS) or alternate automated tool
   tracking systems for accountability and control of tools and equipment. Units who use TAS
   will:
       7.4.1.1. Track the issuance and receipt of all assigned tools, equipment, tool kits,
       HAZMAT items, T.O’s (does not apply to T,O’s, equipment and HAZMAT kept in a
       shop and not dispatched).
       7.4.1.2. Track authorizations/restrictions for special tools/equipment (by individual)
       7.4.1.3. Track inspections required by this Instruction.
       7.4.1.4. Track spare, lost, and damaged (removed) tools.
       7.4.1.5. Develop and manage tool/equipment inventories.
 42                                                        AFI21-202V3 13 JANUARY 2012


      7.4.1.6. If TAS is not available (such as at a deployed location), units may use a AF
      Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, or, a MAJCOM or locally approved form for
      accountability and control of CTKs, equipment, and tools.
   7.4.2. Account for all CTKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment at the beginning and end of
   each shift. Separate shift inventories must be documented by both outgoing and incoming
   personnel. CTKs present during tool room shift inventories do not need to be opened for
   inventory.
      7.4.2.1. Perform a visual inventory of all CTKs when issued for use, at the completion of
      job or tasks, and when returned to the tool storage facility. Accomplish a CTK inventory
      prior to operation of any space vehicle or equipment when maintenance actions were
      performed (e.g., flight control operational checks.).
      7.4.2.2. At least annually or when the CTK custodian changes, conduct a comprehensive
      inventory of all tools, non-CA/CRL equipment, and CTKs. The purpose of this inventory
      is to perform an extensive inspection of all tools and non-CA/CRL equipment, to include
      condition, identification markings, and accuracy of the MIL. Inspect all tools for
      serviceability IAW T.O. 32-1-101, Use and Care of Hand Tools and Measuring Tools.
      CTK custodians document these inventories and maintain the most current inventory
      documentation on file.
7.5. Marking and Tool Identification.
   7.5.1. All units must mark their tools with the standard EID and utilize the AF-approved
   TAS. Contractors are not required to use the EID until the contract requires the use of TAS.
      7.5.1.1. The EID will consist of nine characters (numbers/letters) of which the first four
      characters will be a unique World Wide Identification (WWID) code. NOTE: The intent
      is for the four characters of the WWID to identify the base (first and second character),
      unit (third character), and shop (fourth character) in order to leave the remaining five
      characters available for tool/CTK/equipment numbering.
          7.5.1.1.1. The first two letters of the WWID in the EID are based on the
          wing’s/unit’s personnel accounting system (PAS) base code. Multiple wings (or
          equivalent) at the same base (i.e., ANG, AFRC, and active duty) must have different
          WWID codes. When needed, request additional ―base‖ codes from SSG/ILM, Gunter
          Annex, Maxwell AFB, AL.
          7.5.1.1.2. The third and fourth characters designate the unit or shop by using
          unique/distinguishable characters. To ensure tool rooms have unique identifiers,
          wings (or equivalent) must ensure other units within the same wing or PAS code do
          not duplicate the first 4 characters of the EID.
      7.5.1.2. The unit establishes the remaining five characters (any combination of
      numbers/letters) for CTKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment identification.
      7.5.1.3. Units must place the 9-digit EID on all CTKs, tools not assigned to a box, and
      dispatchable equipment that is of sufficient size. The 9-digit EID must be placed on the
      outside of dispatchable CTKs. Tools located inside the tool box may be marked with less
      than 9-digits but must contain the 4-digit WWID and identifying character(s) that ties the
      tool back to the CTK. For example, tools inside an assigned dispatchable CTK
AFI21-202V3 13 JANUARY 2012                                                                       43


       ―U6JG00001‖ may be marked ―U6JG1.‖ NOTE: Dispatchable equipment is defined as
       items that can be checked out from a support section/tool room/work center to perform
       on-/off-equipment maintenance within or outside the work center. Units may affix non-
       metallic bar code labels on tools to prevent re-etching as long as the use of the tool and its
       work environment does not normally result in excessive damage to the label making it
       unreadable. Tools will be marked with the most current EID. All previous CTK
       identifiers will either be removed or marked out (this does not include Precision
       Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) markings).
          7.5.1.3.1. Small tools or items that cannot be marked as described above (such as
          drill bits, allen wrench sets, apexes, etc.) are to be maintained in a container marked
          with the WWID and an identifying character(s) that ties the tool back to the CTK
          along with the number of tools contained. The container is counted as one of the
          items.
       7.5.1.4. LCG/CCs may require use of the EID and Air Force Technical Order (AFTO)
       Form 65, TMDE Bar Code Label, Aluminum Stock,/Form 66, TMDE Bar Code Label,
       Polyester Stock, for TMDE routinely (i.e., once per week) dispatched from a workcenter
       or use of the AFTO Form 65/66 alone. For items that physically or mechanically check
       tolerances that require calibration, do not etch, or stamp in any manner that will affect
       calibration or the ability to calibrate. If marking is in question, the owning workcenter
       shall consult PMEL.
   7.5.2. Permanently mark (by etching or other means) grease guns, dispensing cans, spray
   bottles, pump oilers, and similar containers with the type of grease, fluid, or other liquids and
   military specification (MILSPEC) of the contents. If no MILSPEC exists, mark the item
   with the manufacturer’s name, part number/National Stock Number from the applicable
   MSDS. Keep hoses and fittings separate for each type of grease. NOTE: If containers are
   used to hold or apply substances classified as hazardous materials, ensure labeling
   requirements of AFI 90-821, Hazard Communication, and local directives are accomplished.
   7.5.3. Fiberglass handled hammers are etched on the metal head only (not on handle) in a
   non-impact area.
   7.5.4. CTKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment that may possess a unique serial/tracking
   number must be marked with an EID number. If the item cannot be marked, etched, or
   stamped, annotate the additional designator on the CTK contents list. TMDE will be marked
   with an EID and/or AFTO Form 65 bar code number for tracking purposes in TAS.
   7.5.5. Items that are assembled and are not intended to be disassembled during use, require
   only one mark/etch/stamp and one entry in the MIL (e.g., scribes, flashlights, grease guns).
   7.5.6. Remove the EID from unserviceable tools and tools removed from the CTK, and
   update the MIL accordingly with the exception of warranty tools where removal of EID
   would void the tool warranty.
7.6. Locally Manufactured, Developed, or Modified Tools and Equipment. All locally
manufactured, developed, or modified tools and equipment must be approved by the Group CC
or their designated representative. This procedure does not apply to local manufacture,
modification or design of tools authorized in specific technical data. QA coordinates on all
 44                                                           AFI21-202V3 13 JANUARY 2012


requests for approval and use of locally designed tools or equipment. Users will review items
and requirements biennially (every two years) for applicability and current configuration.
7.7. Tool Room Operations and Security. Limit tool issue sections to no more than one per
work center. Establish procedures to ensure custodial control. Set up tool rooms to ensure
accountability. Process reports for tools that are lost, damaged, or destroyed, due to neglect IAW
AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property.
   7.7.1. The tool room must be capable of being locked and afford protective measures such as
   monitoring, 24-hour coverage, or controlled key access. When all CTKs are not capable of
   being secured in the tool room, the section NCOI C/custodian will design a process to
   prevent the unauthorized use or access to tools and equipment. Due to space and facility
   limitations, it may not be possible to store oversized tool kits in the tool room.
       7.7.1.1. Tool kit locks will be used to provide a physical barrier to opening the container
       lid, drawer or door and prevent the unauthorized removal of tools. Locks are not required
       on tools and equipment that are stored within secured tool rooms or work centers.
       7.7.1.2. Dispatchable tools, equipment, and CTKs are locked and/or secured when left
       unattended. Tools and equipment are never secured to the exterior of an aircraft.
       Unattended tool kits located within the controlled area are required to be locked, but do
       not need to be secured to another object.
       7.7.1.3. Modifications to tool containers are authorized unless modification voids the
       manufacturer’s warranty.
       7.7.1.4. Tools will not be issued individually from dispatchable CTKs.
7.8. Lost Item/Tool Procedures.
   7.8.1. Supervisors ensure all assigned personnel are familiar with lost tool procedures. If an
   item/tool or a portion of a broken tool is discovered missing, the following procedures apply:
       7.8.1.1. The person identifying the missing item/tool will search the immediate work
       area for the item/tool. If not found, after completing an initial search the individual will
       notify their supervisor or equivalent.
       7.8.1.2. Place a Red X in the Document/equipment/weapon/weapon system forms of all
       affected equipment, or weapon/weapon systems with a description of the tool and a
       specific, last known, location of the tool.
       7.8.1.3. Supervisor or equivalent will immediately notify the FLT CC/Chief, support
       section, Unit Superintendent, and QA.
       7.8.1.4. Initiate a thorough search for the tool.
       7.8.1.5. After a thorough search is completed and the tool is not found, the person issued
       the item/tool will initiate a lost tool report.
       7.8.1.6. If at any time during the investigation the item/tool is found and retrieved, notify
       the FLT CC/Chief, support section, unit superintendent, QA, expediter, production
       supervisor or equivalent, and the owning work center.
       7.8.1.7. If not found notify the unit CC of the missing item/tool.
AFI21-202V3 13 JANUARY 2012                                                                     45


     7.8.1.8. If the item is not located, Operations Officer/MX SUPT shall determine when
     the search may be discontinued.
        7.8.1.8.1. Limit authorization to clear Red X’s when a tool/item cannot be located to
        no lower than Operations Officer/MX SUPT.
     7.8.1.9. When it is suspected that the item/tool has fallen into an inaccessible or
     unobservable area, perform a Non-Destructive Inspection or use borescope equipment to
     locate the lost tool.
     7.8.1.10. If at any time during the investigation the item/tool is found, but is inaccessible,
     notify the FLT CC/Chief, support section, QA, expediter, production supervisor or
     equivalent, and the owning work center.

associated with that procedure or task. Acceptance will be performed by one, or a combination of
the following agencies: System wing/group, SLS, and RMS (depending on the subject). The
Aerospace Corporation will provide a technical recommendation on acceptance or rejection to
the Air Force. Acceptance takes on two forms: One is an acceptance of
items/processes/procedures as required by the contract; the other is technical acceptance that the
AFI21-202V3 13 JANUARY 2012                                                                    51


contractor’s actions have adequately resolved any anomalies/non-conformances and satisfies
Flight/Task Certification Matrix requirements.
Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE)—Ground processing end items that are required to
make a space system operational, not designated as Special Tooling or other production tooling
defined as being allocated to an airborne configuration item, and not designated as Real Property
Installed Equipment.
Annual—When used as a requirement, the term annual refers to a 12-month interval (e.g., a PPE
conducted on 15 Nov requires an annual evaluation conducted by 14 Nov the following year).
Anomaly—An unexpected or unplanned condition that does not meet provided system
performance parameters and which cannot be corrected by organizational maintenance resources
in accordance with validated procedures. After analysis, an out-of-family condition could be
declared an anomaly.
Anomaly Resolution—The process to resolve an anomaly. An anomaly resolution team will be
formed to resolve/disposition all system anomalies. This team may consist of AFSPC,
contractors, and any other personnel needed to resolve the anomaly.
Approval—Approval signifies AFSPC approval/acceptance/coordination                IAW     AFSPC
instructions and Memorandum of Agreements.
Category 1 task— Tasks deemed critical and, at a minimum, contain assessment requirements
that require real-time observation. The tasks may also require data review. This type of
coverage is required due to the potential increase in mission assurance risk if observation and/or
data review is not performed.
Category 2 task— Tasks deemed critical and require data review or real time observation due to
the potential increase in mission assurance risk if verification actions are not performed. Data
review may or may not be performed real-time.
Category 3 Task— Tasks deemed non-critical because there is minimal/no increase in mission
assurance risk if observation and data review are not performed. Problems resulting from these
activities will be addressed and criticality will be assessed per issue. Critical issues resulting
from a category 3 procedure will be handled the same way critical nonconformances are handled
for category 1 and 2 procedures.
Combatant Command (COCOM)—Nontransferable authority established by Title 10, United
States Code, Section 164, exercised only by commanders of unified or specified combatant
commands. COCOM (command authority) is the authority of a Combatant Commander to
perform those functions of command over assigned forces involving organizing and employing
commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction
over all aspects of military operations, joint training, and logistics necessary to accomplish the
missions assigned to the command.
Contract Administration/Surveillance—Active surveillance of contractor performance to

CLS/Contractor Support (CS) contracts specify Air Force assistance to the contractor or when
operating or maintaining equipment at sites or locations not covered by the contract, for example,
overseas and/or remote locations. No other authorization is required except for munitions
manuals. If Air Force personnel are conducting munitions operations (munitions loading,
handling, etc.), authorization is warranted by the respective Lead Command.
Critical System(s)—Critical systems are those that are necessary for a successful mission and
are identified as having test/processing procedures that require direct government observation or
data review.
