1. Background. The Air Force Legislative Fellows (AFLF) program was approved by the Chief of Staff
in April 1995 as a Professional Military Education (PME) program for intermediate service school (ISS)
credit. The AFLF falls under and is a component of the overall Air Force Fellows (AF Fellows) program.
National Defense Fellows (NDF), National Security Fellows (NSF), RAND Fellows, and SecDef Corpo-
rate Fellows are senior service school (SSS) level components of its program. One AFLF group per year
has participated in the program since 1996.

2. Program Description.
   2.1. The AFLF program provides qualified officers and civilians possessing proven leadership poten-
   tial with an intense exposure to the processes, procedures, and culture of the United States Congress.
   The program allows participants to develop an enhanced perspective of the legislative process on a
   wide range of issues, while at the same time providing Congress with on-site experience to lend Air
2                                                                        AFI90-403 17 JANUARY 2001

    Force and defense expertise at the staff level. In the AFLF program, participants work for one year on
    the personal staff or committee of a member of Congress. Specific assignments are determined
    through an interview process between the fellow and Congressional office with the final decision
    residing with the fellow. They are encouraged to join offices with defense, intelligence or foreign
    relations interests.
    2.2. Follow-on assignments are in the legislative arena. Per Department of Defense Directive
    (DoDD) 1322.6, Legislative Fellowships educate DoD personnel on the workings of the Legislative
    Branch of Government with the intent of assigning AFLFs to follow-on tours in which the education
    gained by the fellowships can be used.
    2.3. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management Policy) is active in approving all mili-
    tary fellowships and individuals assigned to them.
    2.4. All AFLF participants will attend an Air Force Fellows academic institution during their fellow-
    ship year. The educational institution serves as the AFLF academic sponsor. The selected institution
    will provide the fellow with instruction and hands-on experience on Capitol Hill through training and
    development activities. The institution will maintain contact throughout the fellowship year and con-
    duct regularly scheduled instructional seminars.

3. Scope/Understanding.

    Legislative Fellow on Capitol Hill.
    3.2. Since they are in a student status, AETC/ED will serve as the office of primary responsibility
    (OPR) for the fellows with SAF/LL performing functional oversight. HQ AETC/EDX (HQ AU/XP)
    will insure the performance of the Air University professional military education goals and objectives
    and perform actual administrative duties during the AFLF academic year.
