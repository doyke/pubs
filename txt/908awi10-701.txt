This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-7, Command and Control
Warfare. It establishes procedures for a timely and orderly response to the Electronic Warfare
Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR) process and how the 908 AW will respond to an EWIR
Message. All references to the wing Electronic Combat Officer (ECO) refer to the ECO or
designated alternate (selected 908th Airlift Wing (AW), Operations Support Squadron (OSS),
and Weapons and Tactics Officer). It applies to all wing organizations with electronic warfare
communication responsibilities. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication as prescribed by AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manual
Program (FMP). Route AF Form 847 to the 357 AS/DOKT at Maxwell AFB AL. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records,
and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.


SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change implements new changes to Responsibilities section and Approving Official
block of this Air Wing Instruction. A margin bar indicates newly revised material.

     1.1. EWIR is a communication intensive process demanding close interaction with numerous
     wing agencies and is directed by the wing ECO.
     1.2. EWIR is developed and implemented through PACER WARE (PW) and SERENE
     BYTE (SB) Messages from the Air Mobility Command (AMC) and Headquarters Air Force
     Reserve Command (HQ AFRC).
     1.3. During contingency operations or periods of increased operations tempo, the 908th
     Maintenance Group (MXG/CC) may request a waiver letter from the 908 AW/CC excusing
     the 908 MXG from participating in SB exercises.
     1.4. Successful EWIR requires a constant communication between all participants. During
     PW or SB reprogramming all units must maintain contact with the wing ECO.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The Wing ECO (or alternate):
        2.1.1. Act as the overall coordinator and single Point of Contact (POC) for
        implementation of all 908 AW EWIR activities and update annually the appointment
        letter for the EWIR Action Team members.
        2.1.2. Act as the OPR for this EWIR Instruction, distribute changes, and review annually
        for applicability and/or changes.
        2.1.3. Direct the EWIR Action Team and convene the team upon notification of SB/PW
        from the Electronic Warfare Systems Section (EWFS).
        2.1.4. Review aircrew and intelligence inputs to include Operational Report (OPREPs)
        and Mission Reports (MISREPs) for potential EW system deficiencies and prepare an
        Operational Change Request (OCR) when discrepancies identified.
        2.1.5. Keep aircrews informed on current and reprogrammed EW equipment and their
        capabilities by publishing and briefing the contents of the latest Reprogramming Impact
        Message (RIM) and System Impact Message (SIM) provided by EWFS downloaded from
        the Electronic Combat Support Flight (ECSF) Website via Secret Internet Protocol
        Routing Network (SIPRnet).
        2.1.6. Consolidate all agencies’ reports and prepare a 908 AW After-action Report for
        HQ AFRC within three days of reprogramming termination.
        2.1.7. The Wing ECO will send out the Unit Loading Message (ULM) received from
        EWFS to the MAJCOM.
     2.2. 908 MXS Electronic Warfare Systems Shop (MXMVE) (EWFS):
        2.2.1. Ensure all personnel assigned are familiar with all applicable EWIR documents,
        procedures, and operating instructions. The NCOIC of EWFS will update annually the
        PW/SB Capability letter and notify the ECO of any changes in the EWIR capability or
        personnel.
Note: Sometimes a software change can be issued as a Time Compliance Technical Order
(TCTO). If this is the case, handle the software change IAW the instructions in the TCTO.
908AWI10-701 20 JULY 2007                                                                        3

aircraft directed by a TCTO.

       2.2.2. ECO and EW personnel will monitor the ECSF Website via Non-Classified
       Internet Protocol Routing Network (NIPRnet) for PW or SB messages applicable to 908
       AW and will determine the action necessary based on the message type.
       2.2.3. Upon receipt of PW or SB message it will be documented on the EWIR check
       sheet. EW personnel will contact the Electronic Combat Officer (ECO) to convene the

       download software changes specified in the (IMP).
EW personnel will prepare the required equipment for reprogramming aircraft EW systems.
Equipment preparation will include but will not be limited to recharging Common Aircraft
Portable Reprogramming Equipment (CAPRE) AN/PYM-1 battery, installing hard drive and
copying software change files(s) to the classified CAPRE hard drive, and checking in the files

message.
Air Warfare Center—Based at Eglin AFB; provides technical expertise and procedures to
update Electronic Combat equipment. The AWC is responsible for updating the ECSF.

Electronic Reprogramming Center (ERC)—plans to compensate for the change in the threat
(i.e. reprogram the affected defensive system). Information contained in a PW RIM must be
briefed to all crewmembers. The RIM should include a filename or procedures for receiving and
loading ―the fix‖ into our Defensive Systems.
Implementation Message—Issued by HQ AMC or HQ AFRC, this message authorizes the
ECO to direct EWFS to load new software in possessed aircraft/equipment. Timing criteria for a
SB begins with receipt of the IMP.
Maintenance Instruction Message—Message from AWC. Similar to RIM – provides ―how to‖
information to reprogram equipment. Message should include a filename if data is being sent.
Maintenance Operations Coordination Center—Located in Building 845 Room 19, the
MOCC acts a point of contact for communication and maintenance.
PACER WARE—the unclassified term for an actual change or notification of a deficiency to an
Electronic Warfare (EW) system.
Reprogramming Impact Message—Message from AWC that details how the
SERENE BYTE—The unclassified term for an exercise change or deficiency notification to an
EW system.
System Impact Message—Message from AWC that warns crewmembers that a threat has
changed in some way. The SIM includes sensitive information that details what effect a change
might make on our capability to wage war on the enemy. Information contained in a PW SIM
must be briefed to all crewmembers ASAP!
Time Compliance Technical Order—Basic Air Force change (usually hardware) to any
aircraft/support equipment. A TCTO is usually issued from ALC.
Unit Loading Messages—Written by the Coordinator, this message notifies headquarters and
AWC that the SB/PW has been accomplished. Must be sent NLT 48 hours after software upload
is complete.   References for this are in AFI 10-703, Electronic Warfare Integrated
Reprogramming.
