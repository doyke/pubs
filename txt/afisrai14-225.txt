                            ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. General. This instruction outlines how HQ AFISRA (as the AF DCGS Lead Command), in
coordination with the AF DCGS community, helps frame policy, translate and integrate issues
from across the AF DCGS Enterprise to the AF DCGS Senior Leadership and Senior Steering
Council regarding the development, fielding, organizing, training and equipping of AF DCGS
assets and capabilities. This instruction establishes community-wide management forums,
defines their interrelationships and clarifies weapon system accountability. For the purpose of
this instruction, the AF DCGS community consists of: HQ AFISRA as the Lead Command and
the Air National Guard and Air Education and Training Command are the only using commands
as identified in Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-9, Lead Command Designation and
Responsibilities for Weapon Systems. Note: AFPD 10-9 (currently being staffed for update and
will be designated AFI 10-902) does not specify AFISRA as Lead Command for AF DCGS;
however it is used as an overarching guide to manage the weapon system.
   1.1.1. Organizational Roles and Responsibilities. The intent of this instruction is to
   specifically delineate the roles of the various subordinate and partnering organizations and
   working groups within HQ AFISRA and the AF DCGS operational community.
   1.1.2. The multiple-command construct of the AF DCGS Community requires a global
   management structure for consistency and efficiency in weapon system development and
   operation. At its highest level, the management structure is comprised of a Senior Steering
   Council chaired by the HQ AFISRA, Vice Commander.

members. The SIWG fulfills the sustainment and support functions outlined in AFI 21-118,
Improving Air and Space Equipment Reliability and Maintainability and AF Methods and
Practices Technical Order (TO) 00-33-1001A, General Communications Activities Management
Procedures and Practice Requirements. The SIWG will meet quarterly as a forum to address AF
DCGS system integration and sustainment issues. In addition, the SIWG acts upon validated AF
DCGS Weapon System integration and sustainment requirements to ensure they are documented
prioritized and synchronized with operational requirements, modernization strategies and Air
Force policy. The SIWG also facilitates the conveyance or exchange of information within the
enabling community while providing a feedback forum for issues impacting AF DCGS Weapon
System reliability, availability, maintainability, and sustainability. AF DGS units will be
represented to brief on-going integration and sustainment issues from their perspective and to
solicit community recommendations and feedback.
2.9. Product Improvement Working Group (PIWG). The PIWG represent air and space
equipment users and single managers, assembled together for the purpose of product
improvement. The PIWGs address product deficiencies affecting reliability and maintainability
which field units cannot resolve, and address active Deficiency Reports (DR) if the lead
command executive agent and the single manager agree they are appropriate PIWG issues. Refer
to AFI 21-118 for additional information on the PIWG.
