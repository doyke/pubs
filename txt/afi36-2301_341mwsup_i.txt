Section A— Purpose and Responsibilities

1. Purpose of DE. Air Force DE programs expand knowledge and increase understanding of
the role of air, space and cyberspace power in times of peace and war. Air Force education
programs prepare Air Force personnel to anticipate and successfully meet challenges across the
range of military operations and build a professional corps. Further, they positively impact both
recruitment and retention efforts. Education is one of three core concepts that make up the
Continuum of Learning (CoL) which encompasses the deliberate developmental path over the
course of an Air Force career. The other two core concepts of the CoL are training and
experience. The CoL ensures the Air Force synchronizes force development efforts so personnel
receive the right education at the right time throughout their careers. This Instruction establishes
education guidance and procedures for all officer and enlisted, active duty, guard and reserve
components, and civilians.
2. Scope. As a common taxonomy used to implement the CoL, the Institutional Competency
List (ICL) which is found in AFPD 36-26, Total Force Development, identifies the competencies
expected of all Airmen throughout their careers to operate successfully in constantly changing
operational environments. The term ―developmental education‖ refers to an array of educational
opportunities. DE is comprised of professional and specialized education programs, research and
doctrinal studies, fellowships, and graduate-level studies. DE spans a member‘s entire career
AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011                                                              5


and provides the knowledge and abilities needed to develop, employ, and command air, space
and cyberspace forces. Career field-specific officer and civilian Development Teams (DT) and
enlisted Career Field Managers (CFM) oversee personnel development to meet functional and
institutional, tactical, operational, and strategic leadership requirements. As such, they will
evaluate developmental opportunities and provide input into the DE selection process.
   2.1. A critical subset under the DE umbrella is Professional Military Education (PME). The
   objectives of PME programs are 1) provide the nation with personnel skilled in the
   employment of air, space and cyberspace power in the conduct of war and small scale
   contingencies; 2) provide Air Force personnel with the skills and knowledge to make
   strategic decisions in progressively more demanding leadership positions within the national
   security environment; 3) develop strategic thinkers, planners and warfighters; and 4)
   strengthen the ability and skill of AF personnel to lead, manage and supervise. These
   objectives shall be reflected in the AF Institutional Competency List and Air University
   Continuum of Education. PME includes resident and non-resident programs listed as
   follows: Air and Space Basic Course (ASBC), Squadron Officer School (SOS), Air
   Command and Staff College (ACSC), Service and Foreign Command and Staff Colleges, Air
   War College (AWC), Service and Foreign War Colleges, National Defense University
   (NDU), Joint Forces Staff College, Airman Leadership School (ALS), Noncommissioned
   Officer Academy (NCOA), Air Force Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy
   (AFSNCOA) and the CMSgt Leadership Course (CLC). NOTE: Non-resident and Distance
   Learning (DL) are the same and will be used interchangeably within this Instruction. DL is
   considered any form of DE in which the learner/learning group is separate from the
   instructor(s)/course provider(s) and communication between the two is via correspondence
   and/or telecommunications/computer-networking systems.
3. Responsibilities. All commanders and leaders will encourage personnel to take advantage of
resident and non-resident educational opportunities. Specific responsibilities include the
following:
   3.1. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR)
   serves as an agent of the Secretary and provides guidance, direction, and oversight for all
   matters pertaining to the formulation, review, and execution of plans, policies, programs, and

   3.2. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Manpower, Personnel and Services (AF/A1)

       3.2.3. Chairs the annual DE Designation Board (DEDB) at the Air Force Personnel
       Center (AFPC).
       3.2.4. Ensures appropriate diversity considerations are integrated in AF-level DE
       policies, guidance and programs. Diversity in the Air Force is broadly defined as a
       composite of individual characteristics, experiences, and abilities consistent with the Air
       Force Core Values and the Air Force Mission. Air Force diversity includes, but is not
       limited to, personal life experiences, geographic background, socioeconomic background,
       cultural knowledge, educational background, work background, language abilities,

        3.12.4.1. When the individual‘s duty performance declines to an unacceptable level,
        or the individual receives disciplinary action.
        3.12.4.2. When the individual has an approved date of separation.
     3.12.5. Acts as approval authority for deferment or removal requests for resident EPME
     courses.
     3.12.6. Ensures promotion waivers for Airmen who cannot attend PME are processed in
     a timely manner to ensure on time promotions.
AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011                                                          15


     3.12.7. Ensures enlisted Airmen promoted via promotion waivers attend applicable
     EPME within established timeframes (Refer to AFI 36-2502, Airman
     Promotion/Demotion Programs).
     3.12.8. Ensures the assignment of additional duties and details for EPME faculty will not
     impede the program requirement for uninterrupted academic instruction,
     student/instructor preparation activities, faculty evaluation of student performance, and
     class preparation and closeout procedures. Faculty and students will be considered
     unavailable for additional duties and/or exercise participation (as if TDY away from
     home station) throughout the course from start date to graduation. When class is not in
     session, the assignment of additional duties and details for EPME faculty will be
     tempered with AU program requirements to evaluate the effectiveness of instruction and
     curriculum, conduct in-service training, complete and implement professional
     development. EPME faculty will support unit and wing activities and perform additional
     duties when not conflicted with the aforementioned restrictions. NOTE: For CONUS
     ALS faculty, these responsibilities typically fall under the Force Support Squadron (FSS)
     Commander (FSS/CC); however, for OCONUS PME Centers this responsibility typically
     falls under the local WG/CV or Director of Staff. EPME faculty will be assigned to an
     Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) cycle in Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 8T000 and
     may be deployed with an AFSC 8T000 unit type code (UTC) tasking with prior approval
     of their MAJCOM/A1.

     3.13.2. Ensures individual names are entered and confirmed against established Training
     Line Numbers (TLNs) in Oracle Training Administration System (OTAS) MILPDS for
     resident PME schools no later than 45 days before the CSD unless managed by
     AFPC/DPS. Provides school websites, orders, and reporting instructions to selectees.
     (NOTE: For civilians, AFPC/DPI will enter and confirm the names in MILPDS.)
     3.13.3. Notifies individuals of selection and date of school attendance and immediately
     notifies AFPC for officers, civilians and enlisted members who are ineligible or unable to
     attend.
     3.13.4. Ensures DE students have commander‘s recommendation for ASBC and SOS
     and     meet    eligibility   criteria outlined in the   Air    Force  ETCA:
     https://etca.randolph.af.mil.
     3.13.5. Provides the ALS Commandant a monthly or bi-monthly listing of eligible ALS
     members by unit of assignment.
     3.13.6. Provides enrollment information and testing support for non-resident DE

     3.14.2. Advises officer, civilian, and enlisted members of fitness requirements to attend
     resident PME. They will appoint a unit representative (if other than the unit first
     sergeant) to verify fitness test scores. Officer and enlisted members must have a passing
     current AF Fitness Test prior to attending any resident PME. For officer and enlisted
     members attending any resident PME course that is less than 6 months in duration, a
     passing AF Fitness Assessment must be current through course completion. (Exceptions:
     members medically exempt, deployed and unable to complete a Fitness Assessment prior
     to attendance as approved by the Commandant of the school the officer falls under).

Section B— Officer DE

4. Architecture. The Air Force officer DE Program is central to the CoL that spans an officer‘s
professional career. Beyond pre-commissioning education, which constitutes the first level of
the CoL, there are four subsequent levels of officer DE: Basic, Primary, Intermediate and
Senior. The Air University Catalog and ETCA online catalog (https://etca.randolph.af.mil)
provides additional details on DE programs. Changes to AU catalog and AU courses listed in
the ETCA must be processed through the AU Office of the Registrar. DE programs are listed by
level (BDE, PDE, IDE, and SDE) in Attachment 2.
5. Attendance. Under the Force Development construct, some officers will be deeply,
functionally developed so as to be the experts in their field. Others will be developed more
broadly for specific leadership and command responsibilities. Limited resources may restrict DE
attendance. Resident PDE/IDE/SDE attendance is further limited to the "best qualified". Non-
resident PME programs for SOS, ACSC and AWC are available to all eligible officers, including
those officers who will not attend resident IDE/SDE at a military service school (i.e., NPS,
AFIT, NDIC, ASAM, Fellowships, etc.).
   5.1. BDE is ASBC. By CSAF direction, there should be 100% attendance goal for ASBC
   for all LAF lieutenants.
   5.2. PDE programs are SOS and SOS-equivalent Inter-American Air Forces Academy
   (IAAFA) course.
   5.3. IDE programs are specified as Intermediate-Level Colleges (in the joint community and
   identified foreign schools) and/or Command & Staff Colleges, internships and fellowships,
   as well as certain graduate degree programs through AFIT, NPS, ASAM and NDIC.
   Command & Staff Colleges include: ACSC, sister service and JPME I equivalent IDE-level
   foreign schools. AFIP descriptions are listed at Attachment 3.
       5.3.1. Resident IDE at all Service schools and the ACSC-DL programs are JPME Phase I
       awarding. Officers selected for IDE at non-JPME I awarding programs (AF Intern
       Program, AF Fellow Program, AFIT, NPS, etc.) are required to complete ACSC-DL to
       receive both JPME-I and IDE in-residence credit. Officers can elect to enroll in ACSC
       by DL/seminar. Officers who are selected to attend a non-Masters degree granting
       program, and/or do not hold a Masters degree may enroll in the AU Online Masters
       Program.
   5.4. SDE programs are categorized as Senior-Level Colleges (in the joint community and
   identified foreign schools) and/or each Service‘s War College, National Defense University
   (NDU) programs (National War College and Industrial College of the Armed Forces), and
   certain fellowships (complete listing of AF Fellowships is at Attachment 4). Resident
   programs at the Service‘s War Colleges and NDU programs award JPME Phase II credit.
   (NOTE: Most NDU programs award both JPME Phase I and Phase II.)

6. Eligibility and Prerequisites. (NOTE: Active duty officer eligibility criteria is listed in
Table 1).
   6.1. Colonels (and selects). To attend resident SDE, Line of the Air Force (LAF) colonel-
   selects must be designated by the promotion selection board as SDE ―selects‖. If a LAF
   officer is selected for promotion to O-6/colonel below-the-zone and has not attended resident
   SDE, the officer will automatically become a SDE ―select‖. A LAF officer promoted to
   colonel in-the-zone, who was promoted below-the-zone to lieutenant colonel and has not
   attended resident SDE, is also designated as an SDE ―select‖. Once designated as a SDE
   ―select‖, an officer will attend SDE as long as their performance continues to meet standards.
   Officers will not attend if they have an approved retirement, are operationally deferred or no
   longer meet the eligibility criteria for attendance.
       6.1.1. Health Professions officers are no longer designated as SDE selects by the
       promotion selection board. However, in order for health professions officers to be
       designated as SDE selects they must meet all eligibility criteria listed in Table 1.
       AF/DPO conducts the health professions SDE selection process in conjunction with the
       Line of the Air Force officer SDE selection process, which is approved by the AF/A1.
       6.1.2. Judge advocate officers (LAF-J) are not designated as IDE or SDE selects by the
       promotion selection board. AF/JA conducts the LAF-J IDE and SDE selection process
       and presents the LAF-J officers identified for attendance to AF/A1 for approval during
       the DEDB.
   6.2. Lieutenant colonels (and selects). To attend resident SDE, a pre-determined percentage
   of LAF lieutenant colonels (and selects) will be identified as SDE selects from their
   promotion selection board. If not identified as a ―select‖ from the promotion board, officers
   are considered a SDE ―candidate‖ and can be nominated by their senior rater to their
   Development Team (DT) to attend resident SDE. The DT will competitively consider
   ―candidates‖ for SDE selection, then vector those selected to the appropriate SDE
   opportunity. Final approval of SDE designation will occur at the annual DEDB. DT-
   nominated ―candidates‖ must re-compete annually for SDE consideration. SDE ―selects,‖ to
   include lieutenant colonels, colonel (selects), and colonels must graduate school no later than
   their 23rd year of commissioned service.
       6.2.1. Board-identified SDE ―selects‖ will attend resident SDE during their eligibility
       window as long as their performance continues to meet standards.
   6.3. Majors (and selects). To attend resident IDE, a pre-determined percentage of LAF
   majors (and selects) will be identified as IDE ―selects‖ from their promotion selection board.
   If not identified as a ―select‖ from the promotion board, officers are considered an IDE
   ―candidate‖ and can be nominated by their senior rater to their DT to attend resident IDE.
   The DT will competitively consider candidates for IDE selection, then vector those selected
   to the appropriate IDE opportunity. DT-nominated ―candidates‖ must re-compete annually
   for IDE consideration. Final approval of IDE designations will occur at the annual DEDB.
       6.3.1. Board-identified IDE ―selects‖ will attend resident IDE during their eligibility
       window as long as their performance continues to meet standards. IDE ―selects‖ must
       complete ACSC-DL if it is determined that their designated IDE program is not JPME
       Phase I awarding.
AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011                                                            19


  6.4. Preference Statement. Lieutenant colonel (and select) and major (and select) DE selects
  may indicate their preference for resident DE programs on the web-based Airmen
  Development Plan (ADP). The ADP is used to communicate officer and senior rater DE
  recommendations to the respective DT in accordance with annual nomination guidance
  published by AFPC. Colonels (and selects) must consult their MAJCOM senior leader
  management office for guidance on submitting preferences. AF/DPO provides guidance to
  the field and to the eligible Colonels (and selects) on the SDE selection process each year.
  6.5. Effective from the date of their promotion (pin on), Captains are eligible to attend SOS
  with a TAFCSD of greater than 4 years but no more than 7 years TAFCS at class start date.
  6.6. LAF lieutenants must graduate from ASBC prior to 23 months of commissioned
  service. However, LAF officers in long pipelines (Initial Skills Training that requires a PCS
  or pipeline training extends beyond 18 months) have until 36 months of TAFCS to complete
  ASBC.
  6.7. Retainability. Officers attending IDE/SDE must have enough retainability to serve at
  least 3 years following school attendance in order to satisfy the resulting active duty service
  commitment.
  6.8. Decorations. Officers attending BDE, PDE, IDE or SDE in-residence are not authorized
  to be nominated for, nor receive, any individual tour completion or meritorious service
  decorations or badges. This is consistent with Air Force guidance for officers in student
  status.

   6.9. Air Force Reserve/Air National Guard. An ANG officer is eligible for resident PME if
   the officer has the proper grade and falls within the eligibility criteria as shown in Table 2.
   Air Force Reserve (USAFR) officers in pay category A or B are eligible to apply for resident
   PME provided they meet eligibility criteria outlined in Table 2 and are not deferred as
   defined in Title 10 U.S.C. 8368(a). Air Force Reserve Technicians (ARTs), regardless of
   method of training, either resident/non-resident, must meet military grade requirements to
   apply for PME. Accordingly, ARTs will attend schools and training courses in civilian
   status, except as otherwise noted. Waiver authority for resident IDE and SDE eligibility
   criteria rests with AF/REP and NGB/A1, respectively.

     SDE         Lt Col or Colonel            Less than 26/25 Years           3 Years
     NOTES:
     1. Officers must have a current passing AF Fitness Test prior to attending any resident
     PME. For officers attending any resident PME course that is less than 6 months in
     duration, a passing AF Fitness Assessment must be current through course completion.
     (Exceptions: members medically exempt, deployed and unable to complete a Fitness
     Test prior to attendance as approved by the commandant of the school the officer will
     attend).
     2. Chaplain, legal and health profession officers who apply for IDE or SDE are
     allowed to exceed the maximum TYCS by the number of years of constructive service
     credited. Minimum retainability is still required.
     3. Air Reserve Technician (ART) eligibility will be stated in remarks section of AF
     Form 1941 or on vPC-GR application.
     4. Major selects (IDE) and Lt Col selects (SDE) may apply if promotion pin-on
     occurs by the first day of school.
   6.10. All non-Air Force attendees must meet the eligibility criteria of their Air Force military
   counterparts unless exempted elsewhere in this Instruction.
7. Selection.
   7.1. PDE. LAF SOS designation is determined at base-level. Non-line SOS designation is
   determined by the functional community.
 22                                              AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011


   7.2. IDE. For majors (and selects) the annual DE Designation Board (DEDB) is convened to
   designate active duty line and non-line officers for resident IDE programs. The DEDB will
   use the officer selection record, the Airmen Development Plan (ADP) and DT
   recommendation to designate officers to a specific IDE program. Selection for IDE overrides
   other pending assignments.
      7.2.1. AF/JA will convene an annual selection board for judge advocate (LAF-J) officers
      competing for resident IDE. AF/JA will submit the officers identified for IDE attendance
      and their designated program to AF/A1 for approval during the DEDB.
   7.3. SDE. For colonels (and selects), AF/DPO conducts an annual selection process,
   approved by the AF/A1, to designate a particular DE program for the eligible SDE selects.
   The board will review the officer‘s personnel record, personnel brief, and MAJCOM
   recommendation. For lieutenant colonels (and selects) the annual DEDB is convened at
   AFPC to designate active duty line and non-line officers for resident SDE. Selection for
   SDE overrides other pending assignments.
      7.3.1. AF/JA will convene an annual selection board for judge advocate (LAF-J) officers
      competing for resident SDE. AF/JA will submit the officers selected for SDE attendance
      and their designated school to AF/A1 for approval during the DEDB.
   7.4. Due to the deliberate nature of the DE selection process, IDE and SDE attendance takes
   precedence over deployment when the individual has been selected for school prior to
   selection for deployment. Furthermore, DE attendance will take priority over deployments
   for all officers in their last year of eligibility. All other individuals will be evaluated on a
   case by case basis with requests from the SR, routed through the DT, and sent to AFPC/CC
   for approval.
   7.5. For Air Force Reserve, refer to AFMAN 36-8001 and for ANG, refer to ANGI 36-2301.
8. Declinations, Deferments, and Removal.
   8.1. IDE/SDE. Officers designated as IDE or SDE ―selects‖ from the promotion board may
   decline select status at any time prior to being designated for attendance. The declination
   results in the loss of select status and replacement of AA or AB codes with the DM code
   (PME declination with prejudice), with an indefinite expiration date, on the officers SURF,
   Duty Qualification History Brief (DQHB), and OSB. The declination will be visible to
   future promotion boards. It will also result in ineligibility for any future IDE/SDE
   opportunity. The officer shall be counseled by his/her commander and shall submit the
   declination in writing, with the commander‘s counseling statement attached, endorsed by the
   senior rater, to either HQ AFPC/DPA or AF/DPO, as appropriate. For lieutenant colonels
   and below, the AFPC/CC will send a letter to the member and Senior Rater informing them
   that the declination letter and counseling statement will be retained permanently in the
   officers OSR (cc sent to MAJCOM A1) along with the letter from the AFPC/CC to the
   member and Senior Rater. For Colonels (and selects), AF/DPO will send a letter to the
   member, the Senior Rater, and the Management Level to inform them of the permanent
   declination. The notification letter and the counseling statement will be retained permanently
   in the officer‘s OSR.
AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011                                                               23


  8.2. Assignment implications. Officers designated to attend DE will receive an Assignment
  Selection Date (ASD) effective the date of release of the DEDB results message. Officers
  who decline DE post DEDB message release are subject to the provisions contained in AFI
  36-2110, Assignments, Table 2.9, Seven-Day Option Separation and Retirement Dates.
  Officers with an indefinite DOS selected for education and training, an ADSC-incurring
  event, who do not want to participate in the event and/or do not want the associated ADSC
  must sign AF Form 63 to decline the ADSC and submit a request for separation in
  accordance with AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers, or request for retirement
  in accordance with AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements. AF/JA may waive this paragraph for
  LAF-J officers.
  8.3. Alternates. IDE and SDE alternates who are designated to attend DE will receive an
  ASD effective upon notification of attendance. If notification is made more than 120 days
  prior to the Report Not Later than Date the provisions contained in AFI 36-2110,
  Assignments apply. Officers notified of attendance with l20 or less days of notice may
  decline attendance without prejudice.
  8.4. Removal for non-prejudicial reasons. AFPC/CC approves individual declinations and
  requests for mission-essential and humanitarian removal from the DE designation list for
  lieutenant colonels and below. If an officer is in his or her last year of eligibility and cannot
  attend IDE/SDE because of mission reasons or an approved Humanitarian or Exceptional
  Family Member Program (EFMP) deferment                   IAW AFI 36-2110, attachment 25,
  AFPC/DPAPF will prepare a letter stating the officer was selected for IDE/SDE but was not
  made available to attend in his or her final year of eligibility. This letter is to be permanently
  filed in the officer‘s selection record and the officer will have (QQ QR) code placed in
  MilPDS. A copy of the letter will be sent to the member and Senior Rater.
     8.4.1. IDE and SDE (lieutenant colonels and below), ―selects‖ who are delayed or
     removed from DE designation lists for mission essential, humanitarian, or other non-
     prejudicial reasons will be scheduled for attendance in the second or subsequent year
     following the deferment, once the DT and DEDB re-validate the select‘s designation as
     long as they continue to perform. IDE/SDE ―selects‖ will only re-compete for a specific
     IDE/SDE program, as they are guaranteed a seat. IDE and SDE ―candidates‖ deferred
     from school attendance with IDE/SDE eligibility remaining will be required to re-
     compete for designation during the following year‘s DEDB. ―Candidates‖ will have to
     re-compete for both designation and for a specific program, as they are no longer
     guaranteed either from one year to the next. The Senior Rater will need to re-recommend
     a deferred candidate to school during the annual call for IDE/SDE nominations, and the
     nomination will be evaluated by the DT. Lieutenant colonels that were designated a SDE
     ―select‖ but have not yet attended, and are then designated as a colonel or colonel-select,
     might not attend the SDE they were designated for as a lieutenant colonel. AF/DPO will
     designate officers in this situation as best meets Air Force strategic requirements and
     developmental requirements for the officer as a colonel.
  8.5. Removal for cause. When a request from the Senior Rater, management level, or DT to
  remove an officer from a DE designation list is approved by AF/A1, the officer will be
  permanently removed from the nomination list. This results in the loss of select status which
  will appear on the officers SURF, DQHB, and OSB. A letter will be permanently filed in the
  Officer Selection Record (OSR) and officers will be permanently ineligible for any future
24                                              AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011


  resident DE. It is the commander‘s and Senior Rater‘s responsibility to monitor the
  performance and standards of DE selects and alternates. Should the propriety of any
  designee's attendance become questionable, the Senior Rater should notify appropriate
  management level A1 (e.g., MAJCOM, DRU, FOA) and HQ AFPC/DPAPF immediately.
  8.6. ASBC eligibility waiver authority for TAFCSD requirements rests with MAJCOM A1s.
     8.6.1. When an officer is selected to attend ASBC but unable to do so, they remain
     eligible for attendance as long as the officer has not exceeded their window of eligibility.
     8.6.2. TAFCSD waiver procedures are:
         8.6.2.1. The unit commander or supervisor initiates a waiver request for an officer to
         attend ASBC in writing, including full justification as to why they did not attend
         during their window of eligibility. This should be addressed on appropriate squadron
         letterhead to the Wing Commander or Senior Rater for endorsement. The letter is
         then forwarded to MAJCOM A1s for approval/disapproval.
         8.6.2.2. The final letter with endorsements should be forwarded to AFPC/DPSIP via
         their ASBC General mailbox (asbc.cot@randolph.af.mil).
         8.6.2.3. If favorable approval is granted, the officer will be placed in the next ASBC
         class with an available quota.
  8.7. ASBC reclama approval/disapproval rests with AFPC/CC.
     8.7.1. Reclama procedures are:
         8.7.1.1. The organization training entity will send a reclama with a named
         replacement, when possible, to the WG/CC or SR for endorsement with full
         justification indicating why the selected officer is unable to attend.
     8.7.2. Rationales such as ―attending off-duty education‖, ―indispensable to an
     inspection‖, ―was not notified early enough‖, ―mission essential‖, has a ―personal
     conflict‖, or ―participating in a special project/local exercise‖ are not acceptable for
     reclamas. WG/CC has disapproval authority.
     8.7.3. Reclama requests endorsed by the WG/CC must be forwarded to AFPC/DPSIP via
     their ASBC General mailbox (asbc.cot@randolph.af.mil) for approval/disapproval.
  8.8. Eligibility SOS Waiver Procedures. Waiver authority for SOS is the MAJCOM A1,
  who may delegate to the wing commander or equivalent.
  8.9. To be eligible to attend SOS in residence, a LAF officer (Active, Guard or Reserve)
  must be a pinned-on captain with more than 4 years commissioned service but not more than
  7 years TAFCS (i.e., 6 years, 11 months, and 30 days of TAFCS) at start of SOS class.
  8.10. Intervening service between IDE/SDE residence attendance. To be eligible to attend
  SDE, officers should have at least 3 years of service since their last PCS resident education
  assignment (e.g., ACSC, AFIT, etc.) as of the CSD. DTs may elect to send an officer earlier,
  but only in the best interest of the AF so as to preclude back-to-back school programs.
  8.11. Air National Guard/Air Force Reserve. For the Air Force Reserve, refer to AFMAN
  36-8001 and for the Air National Guard, ANGI 36-2301.
AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011                                                              25


9. Non-resident/DL Programs. The purpose of non-resident DE programs (SOS, ACSC and
AWC) is to provide DE opportunities to those individuals who cannot complete the resident
program appropriate to their rank/grade or to supplement the available DE opportunities. All
officers, including DE "selects" are eligible to enroll in PME by DL programs, thereby
enhancing their leadership and knowledge of air, space, and cyberspace power. While some
officers may attend an Air Force resident PME program, a number of officers selected for in-
residence IDE or SDE will still need to complete PME by DL in order to receive JPME I credit.
Completion of AF PME is required before an individual can receive credit for completing other
non-resident DE (for example, sister-Service non-resident DE). AF/A1DL is the waiver
authority for all non-resident PME eligibility. HQ AU is the waiver authority for all non-resident
AF PME completion restrictions and limitations.
   9.1. Air Force policy emphasizes taking the right DE at the right time and at the right grade.
   The non-resident sequence is SOS, ACSC, then AWC. Officers may enroll in non-resident
   programs as detailed in Table 3.
   9.2. Officers enrolled in IDE programs that are not JPME Phase I awarding (NDIC, AFIT,
   NPS, ASAM, Fellowships/Internships, etc.) must complete ACSC-DL in order to be awarded
   JPME Phase I credit and be granted IDE in-residence completion.
   9.3. Officers crossflowing into the AF from another Service will receive credit for the
   appropriate PME completed while serving in the sister-Service, subject to the following
   limitations.
       9.3.1. All crossflow officers will receive credit for PME completed before their
       promotion to their current rank/grade. For instance, an Army Major transferring into the
       Air Force would receive credit for having completed CGO PME in the Army.
       9.3.2. For PME in the currently held grade, the following applies: If the officer has more
       than three years TIG at the time of transfer, the officer will receive credit for the grade-
       specific PME completed in the sister-Service. If officers crossflow into the AF with less
       than three years TIG (as captains, majors or lieutenant colonels), they will not receive
       credit for their sister-Service PME specific to their current grade, however, they will have
       the opportunity to complete AF PME commensurate with their current rank/grade.
       AF/A1D is the waiver authority for this requirement.

NOTES:
1. Must have SOS-DL complete to be eligible.
2. AU Online Master‘s (w/Joint Warfare Concentration) is only available to Majors/Major
Selects. JPME I credit will be awarded upon completion.
3. Until selected for Lt Col.



   9.4. AU Online Master‘s.         The AU Online master‘s program was a CSAF initiative
   designed to offer qualified officers an additional opportunity to earn a master‘s degree from a
   regionally accredited institution of higher learning. Originally targeted to Majors, the Joint
   Warfighting concentration ensures its graduates also earn JPME Phase I and AF IDE credit.
   In 2010, the program was expanded to open a concentration in Leadership for qualified
   Captains. Other concentrations are projected in the future. Although graduates from these
   concentrations do not earn AF IDE or JPME Phase I credit, they receive an accredited
   educational experience specifically tailored to the needs of the Air Force.
   9.5. Optional DE opportunities via DL. In addition to the opportunities listed above, officers
   may also elect to complete courses from the Leadership Development Programs (LDP).
   These self-paced optional courses are offered through Squadron Officer College‘s distance
   learning program (SOC-DL). These courses are applicable across the force and include such
   topics as foundational, expeditionary and organizational leadership. Students do not receive
   any PME or DE credits for completion. Also, these credits cannot be transferred into AU
   degree programs.
AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011                                                            27


      9.5.1. Officers may enroll in LDP courses via a self-enrollment DL process. Enrollees
      will have 6 months in which to complete a course or they will be disenrolled.
      Completion will not appear anywhere in a member‘s record but will appear on the
      member‘s AU transcript.
      9.5.2. AF Reserves, Air National Guard and AF Civilians may enroll in LDP courses via
      the self-enrollment process.
10. DE Resident Equivalency Credit.
   10.1. Officers who have attended, are currently attending, or who have been selected to
   attend programs where they were competitively selected by the AF (Table 4), may be
   considered for IDE/SDE Equivalency credit. DE requests for equivalency credit will be
   made via the ADP during the annual nomination call from AFPC. Senior Raters must
   nominate the officer for equivalency credit. DTs will evaluate the quality of the requesting
   member to determine if members‘ records are of commensurate quality with those being
   forwarded for DE attendance to the DEDB. If requesting members meet the DT quality
   review, they then must be approved by the DEDB. To receive resident DE credit, officers
   must also complete the appropriate level of AF PME by DL or seminar. JPME I credit can
   be earned by completing ACSC via DL, seminar or through the online master‘s degree
   program. JPME I credit is required for officers in order to continue towards obtaining Joint
   Qualification Officer status. Once members are approved for resident IDE or SDE credit,
   they are not eligible to compete for another DE program at the same level. Furthermore, if a
   member receives IDE equivalency credit, that same program cannot be applied to SDE
   credit.
      10.1.1. If an officer is outside the annual DE nomination timeline but still in their
      eligibility window, they may request credit by forwarding their request through their
      senior rater, to AFPC/DPA, who will forward to the respective DT, then to AF/A1D for
      approval. Out of cycle requests are for extenuating circumstances only and/or will only
      be considered for those officers that were unable to compete during the normal DE
      Nomination cycle. Out of cycle credit requests are not designed for an additional ―look‖.
      10.1.2. Because officers must also complete ACSC via DL, seminar or the online
      master‘s degree program in order to earn JPME I credit, the completion date for resident
      credit will reflect in the system to show the later completion date of the two programs. If
      credit is awarded for a program completed in 2005, however JPME I is not completed
      until 2010, then in residence completion will reflect a 2010 date in the system.
      10.1.3. In order to obtain SDE equivalency credit, officers must complete AWC by DL
      or seminar. If credit is awarded for a program completed in 2008, however AWC by DL
      or seminar is not completed until 2012, then resident completion will reflect a 2012 date
      in the system. Please note, JPME II credit can only be earned by resident attendance at
      JFSC, other National Defense University schools, and accredited senior-level Service
      colleges.
28                                            AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011


         10.1.3.1. School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS) graduates who are
         AFIT-sponsored faculty-development PhD candidates (all but dissertation) may
         request SDE credit for SAASS PhD completion. These officers are not required to
         complete AWC by DL to receive SDE equivalency credit but must follow the same
         request process outlined in paragraphs 10.1. and 10.1.1.
         10.1.3.2. AF/JA may convene an annual selection board to identify judge advocate
         (LAF-J) officers who have completed, or will complete, the AFIT Masters of Laws
         (LL.M.) program and who are of the requisite quality to be awarded IDE equivalency
         credit. AF/JA will submit the LAF-J officers identified for award of equivalency
         credit to AF/A1 for approval during the DEDB process.
  10.2. DTs may recommend credit for IDE/SDE to the DEDB for nominees requesting
  equivalency credit as listed in Table 4. Furthermore, DTs have the latitude to recommend
  equivalency credit to nominees in the primary ceiling, even if the member did not request
  equivalency credit. The DT has the knowledge and functional expertise to determine the
  needed development of each officer. This includes determining that the member does not
  need to attend an IDE/SDE resident program, when they have previously completed a
  developmental experience the DT determines is sufficient. DTs/CFMs are encouraged to
  discuss this action with the nominating senior rater prior to recommending the credit to
  ensure there are no extenuating circumstances or any unintended consequences.
  10.3. Air Force officers may also participate in other Service, Joint, DoD, and non-DoD
  (international and civilian) PME-equivalent programs. For details on what constitutes joint
  programs, see CJCSI 1800.01. Other Services, US Government agencies, and foreign
  countries participate in Air Force PME programs.
  10.4. DE Equivalency programs listed in Table 4 have been identified because of the
  operational and/or strategic development that each program provides. Tactical and
  functionally focused programs do not demonstrate operational and strategic elements of
  development required by AF institutional education.
  10.5. White House Fellows, Washington DC. This program is not managed by the AF;
  however, details on the program follow. The White house Fellows program is one of the
  nation‘s most prestigious opportunities in the areas of leadership and public service.
  Founded in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, the Fellowship offers exceptional young
  men and women first-hand experience working at the highest levels of the Federal
  government. Selection as a White House Fellow is highly competitive and the program has
  fostered national leaders in many fields including senior military officers, Cabinet
  Secretaries, legislators and CEOs. White House Fellows typically spend one year, running
  from 1 Sept to 31 Aug, working as full-time, paid special assistants to senior White House
  Staff, the Vice President, Cabinet Secretaries and other top-ranking government officials.
  Fellows also participate in an education program consisting of roundtable discussions with
  leaders from the private and public sectors and trips to study U.S. policy in action both
  domestically and abroad. Beginning with Academic Year (AY)2005 starts, White House
  Fellows were granted resident IDE/SDE credit provided they complete a pre-approved
  program.

NOTES:
1. All programs within the table require completion of ACSC/DL or AWC/DL accordingly.
2. With the exception of SAASS PhD candidates, for all PhD programs, officers must complete
PhD. All but dissertation and PhD candidates cannot receive equivalency credit.
3. Faculty Development SAASS PhD Candidates are not required to complete AWC by DL to
receive SDE equivalency credit.
    10.6. All graduates of AFIP, when it was a Captain level program, will be awarded In-
    residence IDE credit upon completion of ACSC-DL. Captain AFIP graduates will not attend
    another IDE in-resident experience. ACSC DL must be complete in order to obtain JPME I
    credit.
11. International Applicants.
    11.1. Before attending a resident PME school, all International Officers (IO) must attend the
    International Officer School (IOS) preparatory course at Spaatz Center for Officer Education,
    Maxwell AFB, AL. IOS is designed to increase the officer‘s ability to communicate and
    participate in the PME schools and to familiarize the IO with US culture and the US Air
    Force. See ETCA https://etca.randolph.af.mil and AU Catalog for details. The applicant's
    military or civilian grade must be equivalent to the US Air Force grades eligibility criteria
    found in Table 1& 6.
30                                               AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011


  11.2. International applicants for non-resident PME programs must be military members or
  civilian employees of the military department of a country or international organization
  eligible for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) training program sponsorship and hold the
  equivalent rank or grade required. (see ETCA).
     11.2.1. A US military officer or US civilian employee in the country, or with the
     organization concerned, must accept responsibility to monitor student progress and to
     serve as a contact between HQ AU and the student. Applicants must be proficient in the
     English language (English Competency Level of 80) to complete the program
     successfully.
     11.2.2. International applicants should send application for enrollment to the in-country
     US representative who will sponsor the applicant and verify, in writing, they have met the
     criteria in paragraphs 11.1 and 11.2. A letter from the applicant's government must
     accompany the application, agreeing to the enrollment and identifying an existing FMS
     publications case against which charges may be applied or International Military
     Education & Training (IMET) to fund the course. If no publications case exists, the letter
     will cite the date of request to Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), AFSAC/CV, 1822
     Van Patton Drive, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5337, to establish a case.
     11.2.3. The US sponsor endorsing the application must send it to Air Force Security
     Assistance Training Squadron, Training Support (AFSAT), 315 J Street West, Randolph
     AFB TX 78150-4354. AFSAT will program the training, after coordinating approval
     from Security Cooperation Officer (SCO), and program against an FMS or IMET case.
     SCO must verify that the sponsor will monitor student progress and testing facilities are
     available. AFSAT Country Manager will advise the sponsor if application is disapproved
     or funding is not available. AFSAT Country Manager will forward student application to
     the ACSC or AWC staff via e-mail ensuring application is attached. AFSAT will advise
     SCO if an application is approved. AFSAT will program the Distance Learning course in
     TRACS and apply appropriate charges against the applicable training case or charge to
     IMET and notify HQ AU to enroll the applicant in the proper program. If a training case
     does not exist that the course can be programmed against, AFSAT will require a Letter of
     Request (LOR) from the country requesting a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) for
     a new case to program the training against. This process can take up to six months.
     Students may not be enrolled or training programmed against the new case until country
     has deposited funds on the case and it is implemented.
  11.3. International officers/civilians applying for a non-resident program must send their
  application to the FSS Force Development (FD) Flight Chief at the member‘s location. The
  FD Flight Chief will verify, in writing, the criteria in paragraphs 11.1.1, 11.1.2, or 11.1.3. are
  met. The applicant‘s government must provide a letter agreeing to enrollment and identify
  an existing FMS training case against which charges may be applied. If no blanket order
  training case exists, the letter will cite the date of a request to the AFSAT to establish a case.
  The FD Flight Chief will endorse the application and send it to AFSAT, who will advise if an
  application is approved or disapproved. If approved, AFSAT will apply charges against the
  applicable FMS training case and notify HQ AU to enroll the applicant in the proper program
  after case implementation.
AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011                                                              31


12. Advanced Studies Group (ASG). The ASG programs are advanced level education
programs that are not considered as IDE/SDE credit-awarding programs but fill an important role
in educating the AF‘s senior officers. ASG programs include: SAASS, Maritime Advanced
Warfighting School (MAWS), School of Advanced Warfighting Studies (SAWS), and School of
Advanced Military Studies (SAMS). Each school competitively selects a small number of
officers each year to participate in its respective program. While the DEDB does not select
officers for these programs; eligible officers, senior raters and DTs must be actively engaged in
the nomination and selection process. AFPC may solicit volunteer from former interns who are
in the window of eligibility as determined by their DTs. Sister Service programs vary, interested
officers may contact AFPC/DPAFP for additional information. ASG assignments should be
synchronized with other leadership and educational opportunities to provide the best
development path for each officer.
13. Air Force Intern (AFIP) and Air Force Fellows Program (AFF). IDE programs
comprised of multiple internships and fellowships designed to develop leadership and broaden
perspectives through observation and interaction with senior DoD, legislative, political, and
academic leaders making strategy and policy decisions. AFIP employs a combination of hands-
on experience working in OSD or Joint Staff, Secretariat or Air Staff, MAJCOM or
USTRANSCOM staff through participation in fellowships or advanced degree programs. The
overall program intent is to further develop the following institutional competencies in future Air
Force senior leaders: Employing Military Capabilities, Enterprise Perspective, Strategic
Thinking, and Fostering Collaborative Relationships through education, experience and
participation. AF/A1DL manages the list of programs included in AFIP.
   13.1. Both LAF and non-LAF officers are eligible to compete for AFIP. AF/A1DL manages
   the seat allocation for all programs.
   13.2. Small Schools Board. AFIP designees will be selected during the second phase of the
   DEDB which selects officers to attend small schools/programs. In addition to AFIP, these
   programs include foreign schools, specialty schools (e.g., JAWS), other AF Fellowships and
   some sister Service schools. Officers must be vectored by their DTs to compete during this
   phase of the DEDB. This ensures the most competitive officers, regardless of functional
   community, are designated to these schools. Officers vectored to more than one small school
   program will, in most cases, be reviewed for each program.
   13.3. All AFIP designees must initiate a Top Secret clearance immediately upon designation
   notification and attend an orientation at the Pentagon prior to program start.
   13.4. AFIP participants will receive an AF Form 475, Education/Training Report, annually
   and upon program completion. AFIP Strategic Policy and Joint Mobility Interns will also
   receive letters of evaluation (LOEs) after each rotation, signed by the rotation Senior Rater of
   the Intern, normally a HAF two-letter. The final Education/Training Report will be signed
   by the respective director/commander of the primary offices designated to provide program
   management: AU for the Fellows Programs, Strategic Policy Interns, and Advanced Degree
   Program participants; SAF/LL for all Legislative Fellows; AMC for all Joint Mobility
   Interns.

     13.4.2. PME Information on the SURF will reflect IDE, Air Force Intern or IDE, Air
     Force Fellow based on program name. Reference Attachment 3 for program name
     information.
  13.5. AFIP participants will not be nominated for, nor receive, any individual tour
  completion or meritorious service decorations or badges for this program. This is consistent
  with Air Force guidance for officers in a training status. Interns/Fellows are not authorized
  permanent wear of OSD, Joint Staff, or Air Staff badges; however, they may wear the
  applicable badge during rotations. No exceptions will be granted.
  13.6. AFIP course work varies depending on the program. The following is a summary of
  required course work according to program.
     13.6.1. AFIP Strategic Policy and Joint Mobility Rotations. Interns who do not have a
     master‘s degree will complete the AU Online Master‘s Degree. Officers who have not
     completed ACSC but have a master‘s degree will be required to complete ACSC by
     correspondence or seminar. AFIP Strategic Policy and Joint Mobility programs are a
     year-long, emphasizing professional growth and active participation. Throughout the
     program, Interns attend (at a minimum) monthly meetings and professional development
     seminars/tours and should not be performing in typical Action Officer capacity. The
     program consists of two six-month rotations, in the OSD or Joint Staff and HAF for the
     Strategic Policy Interns and AMC staff or USTRANSCOM staff for the Joint Mobility.
     Rotation plans will align each intern to areas outside of their core AFSC to obtain the
     greatest enterprise perspective opportunity. These programs will include AU academic
     requirements.
     13.6.2. NLTFP, DARPA, POLAD, McConn Public Policy, SOLA, CSAF Masters and
     Strategic Communication Fellows will not participate in the AU Online Master‘s Degree

     Degree) or 20 months (with AU Online Master‘s Degree). The program includes the
     following: SAF/LL immersion, OSD training, Georgetown University seminar, and 1-
     year assigned duties on Capitol Hill. Military fellows who do not have a Master‘s Degree
     will complete the AU Online Master‘s Degree. Military fellows who have not completed
     ACSC but have a master‘s degree, will be required to complete ACSC by correspondence
     or seminar.
         13.6.4.1. Civilian Legislative Fellow program length varies but is typically a 2-year
         program where the first year is spent with the assigned Congressional Representative
         or Senator and the second year is in the legislative office.
AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011                                                             33


   13.7. AFPC/DPA is the assignment authority for all active duty officer AFIP & AFF
   participants and will work post-program assignments. Normal tour length for AFIP & AFF
   will not exceed 4 total years (this is inclusive of course work, internship, completion of AU
   Online Master‘s Degree and post program assignment). Release due to command selection
   will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Any exceptions to post-program assignments will
   be coordinated through AFPC/DPA, with AF/A1D as the final approval authority for all
   exceptions.
       13.7.1. Strategic Policy/Joint Mobility Interns, and Legislative Fellows will be assigned

Section C— Civilian DE

14. Architecture. The Air Force Civilian DE Program is central to the CoL that spans a
civilian‘s professional career. There are three levels of civilian DE: Primary, Intermediate, and
Senior. For PDE, Career Field Teams (CFT) provide oversight of personnel development. For
IDE/SDE, the CFTs and DTs provide oversight of personnel development to meet both
functional and institutional strategic leadership requirements. As such the DTs recommend the
right person, at the right time for the right training to the CDE Selection Board. Specific course
descriptions are posted on the AFPC homepage.
   14.1. PDE: Squadron Officer School (SOS).
   14.2. IDE: Air Command and Staff College (ACSC), Air Force National Laboratories
   Technical Fellows program (NLTFP), Academic programs, Executive Leadership
   Development Program (ELDP), and Legislative Fellows.
 34                                               AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011


   14.3. SDE: Defense Senior Leader Development Program (DSLDP), Industrial College of
   the Armed Forces (ICAF), Air War College, Academic programs, Excellence in Government
   (EIG and E-GOV), RAND, and NLTFP.
   14.4. Civilian DE (CDE) Selection Board: The purpose of the CDE Selection Board is to
   select employees who clearly possess the greatest leadership potential and who are most
   likely to be assigned follow-on positions of increasingly greater responsibility.
15. Attendance. Under the Force Development construct, some civilians will be deeply,
functionally developed so as to be the expert in their field. Others will be developed more
broadly for specific leadership responsibilities. Limited resources restrict resident DE attendance
to the "best qualified." Non-resident or distance learning PME programs for SOS, ACSC and
AWC are available to all eligible civilians, including those civilians who will not attend resident
PDE/IDE/SDE at a military Service school (i.e., Air University).
   15.1. PDE. All AF civilians who meet eligibility requirements can apply for SOS. See
   Table 5.
16. Eligibility and Prerequisites. (NOTE: Civilian eligibility criteria is listed in Table 5).
   16.1. Civilians attending resident DE or enrolling in non-resident DE must have an
   accredidated bachelor‘s degree as the minimum prerequisite for DE programs.
   16.2. AF-wide, nomination and selection criteria: Performance (overall performance ratings
   for current and prior years as documented in the employee record), follow-on assignment,
   and appropriateness of education program at this stage of a civilian‘s career as depicted on
   the framework for the Civilian Institutional Leadership Continuum are all factors.
       16.2.1. Civilians must have a minimum performance appraisal rating of fully successful
       or NSPS-3 rating to compete for and participate in DE programs.
       16.2.2. Follow-on Assignment: Expect a reassignment to a position as described in the
       framework for the Civilian Institutional Leadership Continuum or Career Field Team
       career paths and master development plans which provides progressive breadth, depth, or
       broadening experience appropriate to the development activity.
   16.3. Endorsing Official: Wing Commander or first SES member or GO in the chain-of-
   command is required for IDE/SDE. Two levels of supervision are required for nomination to
   attend SOS.
   16.4. Developmental Team (DT): Responsible for functional review and ranking of
   nomination packages, vectoring programs and follow-on assignments.

NOTES:
1. As a minimum, all civilians must have an accredidated bachelor's degree to attend in residence DE.
2. Once designated for attendance, completion of a declination statement will result in no further
opportunity for attendance at that same level.
3. The DT can make specific school recommendations to the CDE selection board for IDE & SDE in
residence.
4. GRE scores are required for intermediate programs and must be w/in the last 5 years while GRE
and/or GMAT scores are required for senior programs and must be w/in the last 5 years.
5. A Master‘s Degree is required for RAND, Legislative Fellow, NLTFP, EIG & E-Gov Fellows.
6. Time in service must be as of nomination due date.
7. Civilians must have 12 months minimum time in current position to apply for IDE/SDE as of 1 May
(to include Academic and Experiential programs) and Strategic Education, Level III. Exceptions will be
considered for situations such as expeditionary workforce positions and personnel in career broadener
status.
       16.5. PME Completion. IDE/SDE PME completion is a requirement to be eligible for SDE
       in-residence. IDE/SDE PME completion is also a requirement to be eligible for all Strategic
       Education Course Levels.
       16.6. Preference Statement. Civilians list their program preference in their Development
       Plan located in Secure AFPC webpage or on an AF Form 4059, Air Force Civilian
       Competitive Development Nomination Form, as prescribed in AFI 36-401, Employee
       Training and Development.
       16.7. Eligibility waiver authority. Waiver authority for civilians applying for residence CDE
       programs rests with AFPC/CC. AF/A1DL is the waiver authority for all non-resident PME
       eligibility. HQ AU is the waiver authority for non-resident PME completion restrictions and
       limitations.
           16.7.1. All non-Air Force attendees must meet the eligibility criteria of their Air Force
           civilian counterparts unless exempted elsewhere in this Instruction.
       16.8. Retainability. Civilians will serve at least 3 times the length of courses attended
       following completion. For example, a 6 week SOS course will result in at least 18 weeks of
       follow on service.
           16.8.1. AFPC/DPI will ensure paperwork is completed to move employees into and out
           of authorized Central Salary Account (CSA) positions. Fellows will be assigned to CSA
           positions concurrent with their permanent change of station (PCS) move. Participants
           will be removed from CSA positions when follow-on assignments terminate, and
           graduates transition into permanent positions.
   17. Selection. The annual CDE Selection Board convenes to review personnel records and
   designate nominees to attend a particular DE program. They consider endorser statements and
   DT recommendations. The CDE Selection Board designations are forwarded to the DEDB for
   final approval.
AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011                                                             37



18. Declinations, Deferments & Removal
   18.1. CDE Declination. All declinations must be reported to AFPC/DPI immediately. If a
   member declines once designated for DE attendance by the DEDB, there is no further
   opportunity to compete for resident CDE at the same level. Exceptions for hardship and
   deferment requests will be approved/disapproved by the AFPC/CC.
   18.2. Declination Justification. Management and/or individual declinations for mission
   essential or humanitarian removal from a program must be supported with reasonable
   justification. Declining selection for any program covered under CDE must be approved by
   the nominating organization (Wing Commander or first SES/GO in the chain of command).
      18.2.1. Mission Essential. AFPC/CC will serve as approval authority for mission
      essential considerations. The approval authority will normally approve a mission
      essential removal if the employee's program participation would have an adverse mission
      impact. Removal, if granted, will be without prejudice.
      18.2.2. Humanitarian. AFPC/CC will serve as approval authority for humanitarian
      considerations. The approval authority will normally approve a humanitarian withdrawal
      under the conditions below. Withdrawal, if granted, will be without prejudice.
          18.2.2.1. The recent death (within 6 months of course start date) of a spouse or child
          or stepchild under the age of 18 who is living in the home at the time of death.
          18.2.2.2. The terminal illness of a family member when death is imminent within the
          window after employee's selection and preceding school start date. A doctor must
          support his or her prognosis of a terminal illness by clinical data.
          18.2.2.3. A serious financial problem that is not the result of over extension of
          employee‘s personal income or bankruptcy (e.g. loss of home or possessions through
          fire, theft, or natural disaster) and employee will suffer a substantial financial loss
          unless present. (This applies to employees who must go TDY or PCS to participate in
          a selected program.) Employee must show he/she could not solve the problem by
          leave, correspondence, power of attorney, or by any other person or means.
   18.3. Deferral Justification. AFPC/CC will serve as the approval authority for deferral
   considerations.     Management and/or individual deferrals for mission essential or
   humanitarian reasons must be supported with reasonable justification. Deferrals for any
   program must be approved by the nominating organization (Wing Commander or first
   SES/GO in the chain of command). The deferral must be for the same program for which
   selected for the following year only. Employees who do not attend the year following an
   approved deferral will be subject to the appropriate withdrawal or declination policies.
   18.4. Removal for cause. When a request from the Senior Rater, management level, DT, or
   institution to remove a civilian from the selected program for just cause, that request must be
   approved by AFPC/CC. A letter will be permanently filed in the individual‘s official
   personnel file and the employee will be permanently ineligible for any future resident DE.
 38                                            AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011


19. Non-resident/DL Programs. The purpose of DE non-resident programs (SOS, ACSC and
AWC) is to provide individuals who have not completed resident DE an opportunity to complete
it via correspondence, seminar, or other approved method. To the extent reasonably possible,
DE non-resident programs mirror the resident school curriculum. See Table 6 for non-residence
eligibility criteria. AF/A1DL is the waiver authority for all non-resident PME eligibility. HQ
AU is the waiver authority for completion restrictions and limitations.
   19.1. Sequence. Air Force policy emphasizes taking the right DE at the right time and at the
   right grade. The non-resident sequence is SOS, ACSC, then AWC. Civilians who enter the
   Air Force at a more senior rank may complete a lower DL PME, if desired, prior to enrolling
   in the rank appropriate DL PME. Civilians may enroll in non-resident programs as detailed
   in Table 6.
   19.2. Civilians must be boarded and selected to complete an AU Online Master‘s Degree
   with Joint Warfare concentration (ACSC) through formal AFPC/DPI channels.
   19.3. Optional DE opportunities via DL. In addition to the opportunities listed above,
   civilians may also elect to complete courses from the Leadership Development Programs
   (LDP). These self-paced optional courses are offered through SOC-DL. These courses are
   applicable across the force and include such topics as foundational, expeditionary and
   organizational leadership.
       19.3.1. Civilians may enroll in LDP courses via a self-enrollment DL process. Enrollees
       will have 6 months in which to complete their courses or they will be disenrolled.
       Completion will not appear anywhere in a member‘s record but will appear on the
       member‘s AU transcript. Civilian‘s must have an accredidated bachelor‘s degree to self-
       enroll in LDP.
AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011                                                           39

NOTES:
1. All civilians, to include NAF employees, must have an accredidated bachelor's degree to
enroll in non-resident programs.
2. Based on limited capacity, NAF employees may not enroll in the AU Online Master's
Degree.



20. DE Resident Equivalency Credit. Civilians who have attended, are currently attending, or
who have been selected to attend one of the programs listed at Table 7 may request resident DE
credit. DE requests for equivalency credit will be made via the CDP during the annual
nomination call from AFPC. Senior Raters must nominate the civilian for equivalency credit.
DTs will evaluate the quality of the requesting member to determine if members‘ records are of
commensurate quality with those being forwarded for DE attendance to the DEDB. If requesting
members meet the DT quality review, they then must be approved by the DEDB. To receive
resident DE credit, civilians must also complete the appropriate level of AF PME DL/seminar.
Out of cycle requests for DE credit follow the same procedure described in paragraph 10.1.1 of
this Insturction.
   20.1. Civilians who have completed AF Advanced Academic Degrees, are attending, or who
   have been selected to attend an AAD program may request resident DE credit while eligible

Section D— Enlisted DE

23. Architecture. The Air Force enlisted DE program is central to the CoL that spans an
enlisted Airman‘s career. The Continuum of Education (CoE) is a subset of the CoL and is the
foundation for the development of all enlisted education programs. Education complements
training and experience to prepare professional warfighting Airmen to perform in progressively
more demanding supervisor, leader, and manager positions in dynamic operational
environments. More specifically, enlisted DE develops Air Force Institutional Competencies
and subcompetencies vital to the knowledge and skills required for sound decision making and
strategic thinking to provide the Air Force with Agile Combat Support. Additionally, enlisted
DE also develops critical and analytical thinking skills which enable innovative and creative
leadership solutions and skilled employment of air, space, and cyberspace power in the conduct
of war and contingency operations. There are four levels of enlisted DE.

NOTES:
1. Enlisted Airmen must have a passing AF Fitness Test current through course completion to
attend resident EPME. (Exceptions: members medically exempt, deployed and unable to
complete a fitness test prior to attendance as approved by the commandant of the school they will
attend).
2. Exception: TIS may be earlier for SrA who receive a promotion line number to SSgt. Other
exceptions must be submitted to AF/A1DL for approval.
3. For personnel with the required retainability as of class graduation date (CGD), once selected
attendance is mandatory (exception: declination guidance for NCOA and AFSNCOA). For
personnel who reenlist/extend beyond one year, attendance becomes mandatory. HQ ANG and
USAFR determine separate retainability requirements for their members. All active duty
personnel are eligible to reenlist/extend for the purpose of attending EPME. NCOs and SNCOs
eligible to attend resident NCOA or AFSNCOA with an approved retirement or separation date
within one year will not be scheduled to attend (except when required for promotion). SrA with
an approved PALACE CHASE or PALACE FRONT may attend ALS with four months
retainability as of CGD.
4. Member must complete the SNCO PME Distance Learning (DL) course to be eligible to attend
an equivalent sister Service or comparable international EPME course.

   24.2. ARC.
       24.2.1. See Table 8 and Table 9 and A4/6 Catalog for eligibility criteria. In addition,
       follow applicable ANG and USAFR directives in sending ANG and USAFR applications
       through the individual‘s unit training office for resident EPME. Base Individual
       Mobilization Augmentation Advisors send Individual Mobilization Augmentee, AFRC
       enlisted candidate, and statutory tour applications to HQ ARPC/DRMP, 6760 East
       Irvington Place, 3200, Denver CO 80280-3200, through the member‘s gaining MAJCOM
       Reserve Affairs Office. USAFR NCOs may attend resident PME schools in Air Reserve
       Technician status.
       24.2.2. While resident EPME completion is similarly required for promotion, ARC
       members may complete PME promotion requirements via resident or DL courses, or any
       other approved method. AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion Program, Table 4.1, contains
       EPME requirements for Air Force Reserve enlisted personnel. Completion of DL EPME
       does not preclude eligibility to attend a comparable or lower level resident EPME course.
   24.3. Prior Service
       24.3.1. US Air Force. ARC members entering USAF active duty enlisted service who
       have previously completed USAF resident or DL EPME courses receive full credit for
       their active duty grade requirement. Although not required, these members are highly
       encouraged to complete grade appropriate resident EPME courses to benefit themselves
       and the other students.
       24.3.2. Non-US Air Force.
           24.3.2.1. Sister Service resident SNCO courses are comparable to the resident
           AFSNCOA and thus meet the SNCOA resident requirement. However, the E6 and
           below sister Service resident EPME courses are not comparable to AF EPME resident
           courses and thus do not meet AF resident EPME requirements. Therefore, prior sister
           Service NCOs who enter the Air Force on or after 1 Oct 08, as either SSgt or TSgt
           will complete the appropriate AF EPME according to Table 8 or Table 9 (which ever
           is applicable) at the earliest opportunity. These Airmen will have priority for resident
           EPME attendance ahead of their peers.
           24.3.2.2. Sister Service DL EPME courses are not comparable to AF DL (or resident)
           EPME courses and thus do not meet the Air Force EPME requirements. Therefore,
           prior sister Service NCOs who enter the AF on or after 1 Oct 08 will complete the
           grade appropriate AF EPME according to Table 8 or Table 9 (which ever is
           applicable) at the earliest opportunity.
25. Selection. Selection for active duty members for resident EPME attendance is based on
grade (seniority based on TIG, TIS), promotion line number, priority, eligibility, and availability.
Commanders, supervisors, and individuals must closely track EPME requirements and
coordinate scheduling to avoid promotion delays. NOTE: Individuals selected for resident
EPME will formally accept, decline, or request deferment within five duty days of notification.
AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011                                                            45


  25.1. ALS: Selection and scheduling for ALS attendance is accomplished by the local ALS
  and is driven by the SSgt promotion release. Selection and scheduling is done in accordance
  with this Instruction and ALS ETCA based on grade, promotion line number, priority, and
  availability. Below is the order of priority for SrA attending resident ALS. NOTE: ALS
  commandants may train lower priority Airmen before higher priority Airmen on a case-by-
  case basis in extenuating circumstances if it does not result in promotion withhold for higher
  priority Airmen.
     25.1.1. Priority 1: SSgts without ALS complete (this includes non-prior service and
     prior sister Service SSgts) and SrA in promotion withhold status.
     25.1.2. Priority 2: SrA selected for promotion to SSgt and selected for a 365-day TDY
     tasking or PCS assignment to a location without an ALS.

  MAJCOM/A1s for overseas NCOAs in accordance with this Instruction and the NCOA
  ETCA based on member‘s grade, promotion line number, priority, and availability. Below is
  the order of priority for Airmen attending resident NCOA. NOTE:           AFPC/DPS or
  MAJCOM/A1 may schedule a lower priority Airman before higher priority Airmen on a
  case-by-case basis in extenuating circumstances if doing so does not result in promotion
  withhold for higher priority Airmen.
     25.2.1. Priority 1: MSgts or MSgt selects in promotion withhold status.
     25.2.2. Priority 2: TSgt selected for promotion to MSgt (seniority based on promotion
     line number).
     25.2.3. Priority 3: Non-prior service or prior sister Service TSgt without ALS/NCOA
     complete.
     25.2.4. Priority 4: TSgts by seniority (based on date of rank, total active federal military

     25.2.6. Priority 6: Eligible Air Force and DoD civilians, sister Service, and international
     students on a space available basis.
  25.3. AFSNCOA: Selection and scheduling for AFSNCOA is done by AFPC/DPS and is
  driven by the SMSgt promotion release. Selection and scheduling is done in accordance with
  this Instruction and the AFSNCOA ETCA based on grade, promotion line number, priority,
  and availability. In addition to SMSgts, and SMSgt (selects) who will attend prior to SMSgt
  promotion, MSgts (non-selects) are selected to attend the SNCOA each fiscal year based on
  their combined USAF Supervisory Examination score and promotion board score within
  their AFSC. AFPC/DPS selects members based on scheduling priority below, reviews each
  member‘s MilPDS record to ensure prerequisites are met, and inputs each member into each
  class seat using MilPDS.
     25.3.1. Below is the order of priority for Air Force SNCOs attending resident SNCOA.
     NOTE: AFPC/DPS may schedule lower priority Airmen before higher priority Airmen
     on a case-by-case basis in extenuating circumstances if doing so does not result in
     promotion withhold for higher priority Airmen.
         25.3.1.1. Priority 1: SMSgts without SNCOA complete (based on DOR-lowest to
         highest) or SMSgt selects in promotion withhold status.
         25.3.1.2. Priority 2: MSgt selected for promotion to SMSgt (seniority based on
         promotion line number—lowest to highest).
         25.3.1.3. Priority 3: MSgt (non-select) alternates in order of their alternate sequence
         number based on combined score of Board Score and Promotion Test (lowest to
         highest).
         25.3.1.4. Priority 4: ARC SMSgts on a space-available basis
         25.3.1.5. Priority 5: Eligible Air Force and DoD civilians, sister Service, and
         international students on a space available basis.
  25.4. CLC. Selection and scheduling for the CLC is done by AF/DPE and is driven by the
  CMSgt promotion release. Selection and scheduling is done in accordance with this
  Instruction and the CLC ETCA based on grade and availability.
     25.4.1. AF/DPE forwards confirmed CLC TLNs to the appropriate MAJCOM/A1 (or
     equivalent) with a courtesy copy to the appropriate MAJCOM/CCC.
     25.4.2. The member will acknowledge (in writing) receipt of training date within five
     duty days of notification.
     25.4.3. The member coordinates changes or adjustment of class dates through the
     appropriate MAJCOM/CCC not later than 20 days prior to CSD. A change or an
     adjustment of a class date within 20 days of CSD is considered a ―request‖ and will be
     submitted directly to AF/DPE.
     25.4.4. AF/DPE forwards confirmed class rosters to AFSNCOA not later than 60 days
     prior to CSD.
     25.4.5. Eligible civilian, sister Service and international CMSgt equivalent students may

AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011                                                            47


26. Declinations, Deferments, and Waivers.
   26.1. Declinations. Completing resident EPME courses is an important and necessary step
   in enlisted professional development. As such, the choice to decline resident EPME is
   restricted to personnel selected for NCOA and AFSNCOA with more than 19 years active
   service as of CSD. NOTE: Members selected for ALS or CLC may not decline attendance.
   Declinations are done with prejudice and signed declination statements must be submitted
   within 5 duty days of notification. Eligible NCOs declining resident EPME must retire upon
   reaching 20 years active service or the first day of the seventh month following declination,
   whichever is later. NOTE: Personnel with Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC) that
   extend beyond 20 years TIS are ineligible to decline EPME. Eligible personnel declining
   resident EPME are ineligible for promotion, reenlistment, and participation in the High Year
   Tenure Extension Program.
      26.1.1. Eligible personnel who intend to decline PME attendance may request an
      extension of the 5 duty day time period if needed. Provide justification and the calendar
      date of additional time required. Forward extension requests to: AFPC/DPS via email,
      fax, or memorandum. Unnecessary delay or failure in submitting this request and/or the
      statement below will result in loss of declination opportunity.
      26.1.2. Eligible personnel who decline EPME will sign the following statement: “I
      decline to attend the (NCOA or AFSNCOA) class starting on (class start date), for which
      I have been selected/scheduled. I have, or will have, 19 or more years of active service
      as of class start date. I understand that this declination renders me ineligible for
      promotion and reenlistment, and that I must retire upon reaching 20 years in service or
      the first day of the seventh month following the date of this declination, whichever is
      later. I further acknowledge that this declination renders me ineligible to participate in
      the High Year Tenure Extension Program.” After updating AAC 9 in MilPDS, forward
      the signed statement along with the signed AF Form 964, PCS, TDY or Training
      Declination Statement to AFPC IAW established procedures for including miscellaneous
      documents in member‘s Personnel Records Display Action (PRDA).
   26.2. Deferments. Airmen selected for resident EPME may be deferred for compelling non-
   routine mission, humanitarian, medical, or other reasons (as described below) without
   prejudice upon approval of the member‘s wing commander (or equivalent). Deferment
   requests will be kept to the absolute minimum. EPME deferment requests require solid
   justification, wing command chief coordination/concurrence, and wing commander (or
   equivalent) approval. In all cases, resident attendance remains mandatory for enlisted
   personnel as outlined in this Instruction.
      26.2.1. Commanders, first sergeants, and supervisors should make their people available
      as scheduled for EPME and hold deferment requests strictly to the following criteria.
          26.2.1.1. Mission: The individual scheduled to attend is indispensible to the mission;
          in short, the mission will fail without their presence. No other individual could stand

        stressful family or personal situation or an emergency situation with an immediate
        family member as similarly defined under humanitarian reassignment guidance.
        26.2.1.3. Medical: The individual scheduled to attend has a medical condition
        (including some pregnancies) that renders him/her ineligible for course attendance or
        requires on-going treatment (including Mental Health counseling and ADAPT
        program) that would be detrimental if interrupted. EPME commandants will
        determine the member‘s eligibility based on the school‘s ability to accommodate the
        member‘s medical condition and an overall assessment of the member‘s ability to
        meet course objectives.
        26.2.1.4. Other:      Unit commanders may request deferment/non-recommend
        individuals for EPME attendance based on extenuating circumstances not covered
        above. Examples may include member‘s poor duty performance (not covered under
        control roster actions but detrimental to the academic environment), pending
        disciplinary action, under investigation, etc.

     AFSNCOA attendance until tour completion. Members serving overseas tours of 16
     months or longer may attend the AFSNCOA from the overseas assignment if they have at
     least one year remaining in the overseas area upon graduation and meet all other
     eligibility criteria. AFPC/DPS may waive this requirement to 120 days remaining in the
     overseas area upon graduation, if the unit commander and MAJCOM approve.
     (Exception: EPME attendance is mandatory due to promotion selection.)
     26.2.3. Deferment Procedures
        26.2.3.1. ALS: Process unit/CC approved deferment requests through the respective
        chain of command to the ALS commandant for coordination, wing command chief
        (WG/CCC) for coordination and WG/CC approval. Send WG/CC approved
        deferments to the ALS NLT 30 days prior to CSD for action. The ALS will file
        approved deferments and notify the member‘s unit of the approved deferment.
        26.2.3.2. NCOA/AFSNCOA: Process unit/CC approved deferment requests through
        the respective chain of command to the member‘s WG/CCC for coordination and
        WG/CC (senior rater (or equivalent) for approval. Send WG/CC approved
        deferments for CONUS NCOAs and AFSNCOA (and sister Service equivalents)
        through AFPC/DPS (with a copy to member‘s MAJCOM A1) as close to receipt of
        training allocation as possible, but not less than 45 days prior to CSD for action. For
        overseas NCOAs, process WG/CC approved deferment through the wing formal
        training office/appropriate MAJCOM.

        MAJCOM CCM. MAJCOM, FOA, DRU forward approved deferment requests to
        AF/DPE no later than 35 days prior to class start date. Because of required pre-
        course work, it is imperative deferment requests are forwarded in a timely manner
        since AF/DPE will be required to notify an alternate.
AFI36-2301_341MWSUP_I 3 MARCH 2011                                                                49


   26.3. Waivers: Resident EPME completion may be waived (by exception) in accordance

   EPME before promotion due to circumstances beyond their control (i.e., remote tours,
   deployments, medical issues, personal hardship, EFMP, etc.)
        26.3.1. Commanders and supervisors will make every effort to ensure Airmen selected
        for promotion complete required EPME prior to departure for remote tours, deployments,
        extended TDYs (45 days or more), lengthy formal training/retraining, etc. However, if
        EPME completion is not possible prior to departure, commanders are required to seek a
        promotion waiver.
        26.3.2. Airmen with approved waivers must attend EPME (in the next higher grade) as
        soon as possible without negatively impacting the mission or member. Airmen with
        approved waivers serving on remote tours or extended deployments, or attending lengthy
        formal training/retraining will attend EPME within 120 days of completing the remote
        tour, deployment, or training and NLT 60 days prior to subsequent re-deployment,
        training, or PCS.

making.
25. Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows Program (SDCFP). The SDCFP was established
by the Secretary of Defense in 1994, to become a long-term investment in transforming U.S.
forces and capabilities and, as such, is a key part of the Department of Defense (DoD) strategy to
achieve its transformational goals. Officers from each military Service are selected each year to
receive their military senior DE credit by training with sponsoring institutions, i.e., corporations,
companies, commercial enterprises, etc., who have earned a reputation for insightful long-range
planning, organizational and management innovation, and implementation of new information
and other technologies. SDCFP Fellows form a cadre of future leaders made knowledgeable in
the organizational and operational opportunities made possible by their training throughout the
year. At the conclusion of the assignment, each member of the SDCFP provides group/individual
briefings to the Secretary of Defense/Deputy Secretary of Defense, Service Secretaries and
Chiefs, and over three dozen other senior OSD and Service leaders on private industry best
practices and the Fellow‘s assessment as to their applicability to transform the Department of
Defense. Recent Fellows have spent a year at Booz Allen Hamilton, FedEx Corporation,
Johnson & Johnson, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company, Sarnoff Corporation,
Southern Company, Sun Microsystems, Inc., and United Technologies Corporation.

26. AU Research Fellowship. Air University is in the process of accrediting a PhD program in
Military Strategic Art. When this program is accredited (anticipated December 2010), select
students of the School of Advanced Air and Space Studies who achieve all-but-dissertation status
at graduation will be given the opportunity for a one-year research fellowship to complete a
book-length dissertation that makes an original contribution to the field of strategy or security
studies. Upon completion of the dissertation, candidates will be awarded a Doctorate of
Philosophy in Military Strategic Art. The location of the fellowship will be conducive to
researching the subject at hand and perhaps a follow-on assignment. Fellows may attend Joint
Forces Staff College for Phase II JPME.

                    DE EQUIVALENCY FOR NON-AF PME SCHOOLS

DE Equivalency for international Service schools. DE equivalency for international Service
schools is granted by AF/A1DL upon formal AU/CF recommendation based upon a full review
of the program (Attachments 9).
A program is considered equivalent to an AF PME program when its curriculum, in terms of
educational level, content, and academic rigor, is the same as or very similar to the PME
program to which it is being compared. For example, comparing respective sister Service
schools.
Another military school program may be considered comparable, but not equivalent, if the
curriculum meets the educational level, academic rigor, and most major content areas, but not all
the key content of the AF PME program. For example, a program comparable to AWC may be
similar in most areas, but lacking in one or more of the major subject areas.
The term ―academic rigor‖ in the above paragraphs relates to a variety of curriculum and
instructional issues. To ensure a relatively consistent application of standards of academic rigor
in equivalency/comparability evaluations, AU focuses on several categories, such as the
instructional program, faculty, students, and curriculum content. Attachment 8 provides a set of
categories used by AU for equivalency/comparability evaluations.

     EQUIVALENCY/COMPARABILITY RECERTIFICATION GUIDANCE FOR
                  INTERNATIONAL PME PROGRAMS

The US Air Force provides for the evaluation of international PME programs to determine their
equivalence/comparability with AF PME programs. Equivalency certification benefits AF
officers by ensuring they receive the appropriate level of PME at the schools they attend. The
Air University (AU) is the AF agent for determining educational equivalence/comparability of
international PME programs.
Because PME programs change over time, it is imperative that equivalent/comparable
international PME programs be reviewed periodically to ensure their continued
equivalence/comparability with AF PME programs. This, in turn, ensures AF officers continue
to receive the best possible education from cooperating international programs.
Following initial determination of equivalence/comparability with an AF PME program,
international PME programs must be re-certified to continue that status every five years
thereafter. In December of each year, AU provides AF/A1DL a list of international PME
schools requiring recertification the following calendar year. AF/A1DL requests SAF/IA acquire
the necessary curriculum documents, in English, from the international schools and forward them
to AU for review. The minimum information needed by AU for conducting a review is listed in
Attachment 9 of this Instruction.
International PME programs that are determined not to be equivalent or comparable, or that do
not submit their curriculum for recertification, are recommended to be placed on probationary
status for one year. The following year, the program will be reviewed again. If that review still
shows the program is not equivalent or comparable, then a recommendation for removal from the
―Equivalent Schools‖ list may be made to AF/A1DL. Final approval authority is the AF/A1.
If a school is approved for removal from the Equivalent Schools list, AF personnel currently in
the pipeline to attend the school will be authorized to attend the school and will receive the
appropriate DE credit for completion of the program. However, no new personnel will enter into
the pipeline (to include language training, etc) for that specific school.
A school that has been removed from the Equivalent Schools list may resubmit their curriculum
for another equivalency review at any time, and may, upon determination of
equivalency/comparability, be reinstated on the list. Once a school has been reinstated to the list,
AF personnel may again be entered into the pipeline for school attendance.
The requestor must complete Attachment 9 and send to AU/CF.
