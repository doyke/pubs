     1.8.3. Quarterly/annual military winners (excluding team) at all levels are authorized time-
     off passes subject to the commander’s or director’s discretion. As a baseline, 635 SCOW

     a 2-day pass for annual awards.
     1.8.4. Quarterly/annual civilian winners at all levels are authorized a Time-Off Award

     upon completion of competition. Squadron CCs may approve TOAs not to exceed amounts
     allowed at the group level. Note: Number of hours awarded will be based on an
     individual’s typical daily work schedule (e.g., 1/2 day TOA for an employee working a
     compressed or alternate work schedule will equate to 4.5 hours).

            SPECIAL TROPHIES AND AWARDS/FUNCTIONAL AWARDS

2.1. Policy. Special trophies and awards and functional awards (e.g., Lance P. Sijan Award,
Joan Orr, Logistics Readiness Awards, etc.) will be tasked via WTT. The suspense will include
detailed instructions to complete the entire package. The award OPR identified in the WTT will
conduct ad hoc electronic selection boards as necessary.
2.2. Local Awards Programs. IAW AFI 36-2805, CCs/CLs at any level may establish special
trophies and awards programs to recognize military and civilian members and units or
organizations. However, CCs/CLs are prohibited from duplicating elements of existing formal
award programs (e.g., providing time off awards/mementos in addition to what is issued by the
award sponsor). Note: Recognizing an achievement or accomplishment in performance reports
or a citation to accompany an award is not considered duplication or dual recognition. No
monetary awards are authorized.
2.3. Special Trophies and Awards and Host Base Awards.
   2.3.1. The 635 SCOW units are highly encouraged to participate in local awards programs
   such as host-base Logistics Officer Association, Airlift-Tanker Association, Air Force
   Sergeants Association, Top-3 Association, and other local programs as available.
   2.3.2. Additional opportunities for various Special Trophies and Awards, such as Joan Orr
   Spouse of the Year, NCOA Vanguard Award, and others, will always be sent as a suspense
   via WTT for each unit to submit their nominees.
