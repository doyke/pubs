  1.2.5. Flight CCs will:
     1.2.5.1. Monitor individual assigned aircrew currencies and requirements to ensure flight
     members maintain currency and accomplish training requirements for their designated
     flight status.
 8                                                                 AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010


        1.2.5.2. Assess individual crewmembers’ potential for upgrade in cooperation with
        functional or designated functional leads.
     1.2.6. Individual aircrew members will:
        1.2.6.1. Be responsible for completion of training requirements and currencies within the
        guidelines of this instruction.
        1.2.6.2. Participate only in ground and flying activities for which they are qualified and
        current, under the direct supervision of an instructor, or unless otherwise allowed for in
        this instruction or under an appropriate waiver.
1.3. Not Used.
1.4. Phases of Training. Aircrew training is designed to progress the unqualified crewmember
from Initial Qualification Training (IQT), Transition Training (TX), Requalification Training
(RQ), to Mission Qualification Training (MQT) and finally to Continuation Training (CT).
     1.4.1. Qualification Training. IQT, TX, and RQ provide training necessary to initially
     qualify aircrew in a basic position and flying duties without regard to a specific unit or
     squadron mission. Upon completion of IQT, TX, or RQ the crew member attains Basic
     Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. Except for general officers above the wing level, BAQ
     is not a long-term qualification status. Waiver authority for any crewmember other than
     General Officers above the wing level to remain in BAQ for longer than 6 months is the
     MAJCOM A3.
     1.4.2. BAQ. Following completion of E-8C IQT, TX, or RQ, an aircrew member will have
     received training in the basic missions and flying duties of the E-8C and will be awarded
     BAQ status. Following completion of Upgrade Training, member will be BAQ until certified
     as CMR by the squadron commander. Aircrew members completing IQT, TX, or RQ, must
     receive appropriate mission-specific MQT from the operational unit of assignment following
     Formal Training Unit (FTU) level training regardless of FTU syllabus content.
     1.4.3. MQT. BAQ is a requisite status for MQT. MQT provides the training necessary to
     initially qualify or re-qualify an aircrew in a specific crew position and flying duties to
     perform the missions assigned to a specific unit. If loss of qualification is due to extended
     non-availability for flying without PCS, MQT is at the discretion of the OG/CC. Aircrews
     maintain BAQ status until they complete MQT. Completion of MQT is a pre-requisite for
     Basic Mission Capable (BMC) or Combat Mission Ready (CMR). Upon successful
     completion of MQT, members will have been trained in all the basic missions of the unit and
     will be assigned BMC or CMR status as appropriate by the Squadron Commander. Upon
     applicable MR status assignment, members transition into the Continuation Training (CT)
     program. Note: MQT for members following positional upgrade (UGT) training is optional
     and at the discretion of individual Sq/CC provided they received MQT in a subordinate crew
     position.
     1.4.4. Continuation Training (CT) functions as the cornerstone of the Ready Aircrew
     Program (RAP). CT begins after completion of MQT and is designed to focus training on
     capabilities and skills needed to accomplish a unit’s core tasked missions. Levels and
     amount of CT varies within BMC and CMR RAP qualification levels depending on
     member’s experienced/inexperienced designation. Experience level and MR status is
AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010                                                                    9


  assigned to each crewmember following completion of MQT by the gaining squadron
  commander.
     1.4.4.1. BMC. The minimum training required for aircrew to become familiar with all of
     the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapons system. As an option,
     BMC training may also include those minimums required to attain and/or maintain
     proficiency in one or more of the unit’s mission taskings. BMC members are required to
     provide additional combat mission generation capability, either in lieu of or in addition
     to, the personnel assigned to the flying squadrons. BMC aircrew will maintain
     familiarization with all unit core missions and will accomplish mission-related ground
     training as listed in the RAP Tasking Memorandum (RTM). They may also maintain
     proficiency and qualification in one or some of the unit core missions. For those
     missions in which they maintain familiarization only, BMC aircrew must be able to attain
     proficiency and qualification in 30 days or less. BMC aircrew may deploy and
     participate in any non-combat / non-contingency mission for which they are proficient
     and qualified, without additional training, as determined by the SQ/CC. Failure to
     complete BMC required training results in regression to Non-BMC (N-BMC) status.
     While N-BMC, aircrew may not perform RAP training sorties without supervision until
     SQ/CC approved re-certification program is complete.
        1.4.4.1.1. BMC designation will be assigned to aircrew that have a primary job
        performing wing supervision or staff functions that directly support the flying
        operations and includes FTU instructors, WIC instructors, operational test aircrew,
        and subject matter experts assigned to 29 TSS and ACC TRSS/ DET 7, 605 TS, Det 2
        personnel. BMC designation will also be assigned to personnel occupying API-
        6/8/B/D who are not designated CMR by the OG/CC. API-8/D (above wing level)
        personnel flying authorizations will be IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM guidance.
        They will fly the BMC rate; however they are not required to complete all BMC
        specific missions/events. All other wing active flying positions not identified in
        paragraph 1.4.4.3. are designated BMC positions.
     1.4.4.2. CMR. CMR training requirements represent the minimum training required for
     aircrew to be qualified and proficient in all of the primary missions tasked to their
     assigned unit and weapons system.
     1.4.4.3. All API-1/2/A positions, line flying officers, and enlisted aircrew members,
     flying SQ/CC and SQ/DO positions, and wing SEFEs are designated CMR positions.
     OG/CCs may designate other API-6/B positions not assigned to a flying squadron as
     CMR. EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, the SQ/CC may elect to train the front
     line of their Unit Manning Document (UMD) to CMR and designate the overage BMC.
     In this case, priority should be given to inexperienced aircrew for CMR designations. A
     minimum of 50% (if available) of the aircrew selected for CMR must be inexperienced
     (if available).
        1.4.4.3.1. CMR aircrew will maintain proficiency and qualification in all core
        missions of the flying unit to which they are assigned or attached. CMR aircrews
        maintain currencies which affect CMR status. All SEFEs are required to maintain
        CMR status. Failure to complete this training or maintain these currencies results in
        regression to N-CMR status unless waived by appropriate authority. While N-CMR,
 10                                                              AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010


              aircrew may perform training missions (including exercises) in which they are
              current, qualified, and either familiar or proficient, similar to BMC aircrew.
   1.4.5. Experience Levels. Aircrew experience levels tell unit commanders how much flying
   and simulator training is needed to meet RAP levels. For the crewmember, ―Experienced‖
   designations are solely used to identify who may fly and train at reduced RAP rates.
   Squadron Commanders are responsible to designate crew members as experienced /
   inexperienced as they deem appropriate and IAW minimum requirements set forth Table 1.1.
       1.4.5.1. ―Inexperienced‖ designations identify aircrew members who, due to their limited
       experience, require prescribed levels of exposure to flying and/or mission events to
       maintain CMR status.
       1.4.5.2. ―Experienced‖ designations identify aircrew members who have demonstrated
       increased proficiency and airmanship, therefore require less training to maintain
       satisfactory performance in their respective MR status.

1.5. Training Concepts and Policies.
   1.5.1. The aircrew training cycle is 12 months. Units will complete training requirements
   during the appropriate training cycle except where specifically exempt. This instruction
   provides training guidelines and policies to be used with operational procedures specified in
   applicable flying/operations publications. RTM may be used to tailor specific training
   events, frequencies, currencies, and rules for crediting training events. RTMs may not be
   less restrictive or deviate from training concepts and policies outlined in this instruction.
   1.5.2. HQ ACC Training Support Squadron (TRSS) will develop and validate training
   programs when tasked by the 116OG/CC or CD-T.
       1.5.2.1. 116 OSS/OST will collect specific inputs from operational squadrons, 116
       OG/OGV, and 116 OSS/OSK regarding the effectiveness of the QT/UGT training and
       evaluation trends necessary to develop continuation training or recommend changes to
       applicable syllabi as required. Note: The FTU will interface directly with Det 7.
       116OSS/OST will participate in all syllabus review conferences.
AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010                                                                        11


   1.5.3. Training missions. Missions will be designed to achieve combat capability in
   squadron-tasked roles, maintain proficiency, enhance mission accomplishment, and cultivate
   flying safety. Training missions will emphasize either basic combat skills, or scenarios that
   reflect procedures and operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence,
   and opposition capabilities. Use of procedures and actions applicable to combat scenarios are
   desired (e.g., appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures, combat tactics, safe
   recovery procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions, Intel
   briefing/debriefing).
   1.5.4. In-flight Supervision. Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of
   supervision necessary to accomplish required training. If the mission objectives include
   introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous performance discrepancies, then an
   instructor is required
      1.5.4.1. Unqualified (UQ) aircrew members are not authorized to perform any flight
      duties unless under instructor/evaluator supervision. UQ aircrew members are
      specifically defined as any member who is:
          1.5.4.1.1. Enrolled in E-8C Qualification Training (E-8C IQT/TX/RQ).
          1.5.4.1.2. Downgraded for being non-current more than 6 months IAW Table 4.4.
          1.5.4.1.3. Downgraded for a demonstrated lack of ability.
          1.5.4.1.4. Downgraded for failure to meet standards during a flight evaluation.
      1.5.4.2. Qualified members in upgrade training are not considered UQ and will maintain
      their applicable pre-upgrade qualification status throughout upgrade training (paragraph
      5.6.1). Events accomplished in training may update currencies, but are not creditable as
      RAP events.
      1.5.4.3. BAQ status is the minimum training status that authorizes crew members to
      perform all duties associated with position in which they are qualified. Mission,
      operational, and supervision restrictions may apply to BAQ members.
      1.5.4.4. Aircrew members’ non-current in an event may fly a mission without
      supervision by an instructor or squadron supervisor (as applicable) provided:
          1.5.4.5.1. Expected flight conditions provide reasonable certainty that performance
          of the non-current event will not be required in order to conduct that particular flight
          or mission.
          1.5.4.5.2. Flight is approved by applicable authority IAW AFI 11-202V3, General
          Flight Rules, and local directives. Note: The Pilot in Command (PIC) is responsible
          for, and is the final authority as to the operation of the aircraft.
1.6. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Policy and Management.
   1.6.1. RAP mission readiness and experience levels are defined by a total number of RAP
   sorties, broken down into training events, plus specific qualifications and associated events as
   determined by the MAJCOM and unit commanders.
 12                                                                AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010


   1.6.2. An effective RAP training sortie requires accomplishing a tactical mission profile or a
   building block type sortie. The breakout of events provided in the RTM is the minimum
   amount of training required to maintain proficiency.
   1.6.3. The SQ/CC's first priority should be to train all designated aircrew to CMR.
   1.6.4. Progression from BMC to CMR first requires:
      1.6.4.1. Satisfactory 1 month lookback at applicable BMC rate.
      1.6.4.2. Certification in all missions and specialized mission training required by the
      CMR level.
      1.6.4.3. Completion of mission-related ground training and verification of that training.
      1.6.4.4. SQ/CC certification.
   1.6.5. When circumstances require an immediate fielding of CMR crew member(s) for an
   impending operational contingency, SQ/CC may waive paragraph 1.6.4.1 and paragraph
   1.6.4.2 provided the member meets 1 month lookback at the CMR rate and is current and
   qualified to perform the tasked mission. Requirements listed in 1.6.4.3 and 1.6.4.4 will still
   apply.
   1.6.6. SQ/CCs will determine and assign aircrew members that will train for and maintain
   special capabilities or qualifications (if applicable). Specialized training is normally
   accomplished in addition to baseline CMR/BMC sortie/event requirements.
1.7. Training Sortie Program Development.
   1.7.1. RAP sortie and event requirements as listed in the RTM apply to BMC and CMR
   aircrew, as well as those carrying special capabilities or qualifications. The sortie
   requirements in the RTM establish the minimum number of sorties per training cycle for
   BMC and CMR levels of training.
   1.7.2. Non-RAP requirements (if applicable) are in addition to RAP requirements. These
   requirements ensure basic aircrew skills are maintained.
   1.7.3. Unit flying hour programs are allocated a number of attrition sorties that compensate
   for non-effective training sorties. Non-effective sorties are logged when a training sortie,
   RAP or Non-RAP is planned but a major portion of valid training for that type of mission is
   not accomplished due to poor weather, air aborts, etc. In order to accurately allocate the
   number of attrition sorties, it is essential that non-effective sorties are logged appropriately.
   Note: Look-back does not apply to BAQ aircrew members.
1.8. Training Records and Reports. Units will maintain aircrew training records for
individual training IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm, MAJCOM directives and wing
directives.
   1.8.1. Units will document and maintain aircrew certification/upgrade training in individual
   training folders IAW local directives and the Air Force RDS.
   1.8.2. Units will prepare and forward training reports IAW MAJCOM directives.
AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010                                                                         13


   1.8.3. Units using the Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) will maintain
   aircrew training records IAW ACCI 11-464, Training Records and Performance Evaluation
   in Formal Flying Training Programs; and AFI 11-401 as supplemented. When documenting
   aircrew training in ARMS, use AF Form 1522, ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment
   Input, and AF IMT 4324, ARMS Upgrade Worksheet, AFTO form 71, Aircrew MARS sheet
   and AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. If additional forms are
   needed, see AFI 33-360 for guidance.
   1.8.4. ARMS will be used to track the following information for all aircrew (as applicable):
       1.8.4.1. Ground training.
       1.8.4.2. Currencies.
       1.8.4.3. Requirements and accomplishment of individual sorties, RAP sorties (using 1-
       month and 3-month running totals for look back), sortie types, and events cumulatively
       for the training cycle.
       1.8.4.4. Any other training event the OG/CC deems necessary to track.
1.9. Aircrew Utilization Policy. Commanders will ensure aircrew members occupy authorized
positions IAW unit manning documents and that aircrew status is properly designated. The
overall objective is that aircrew members perform combat-related duties. Supervisors may
assign aircrew to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, FEB/mishap board member, etc.), but
must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of aircrew tasking, flying proficiency,
currency, and experience.
   1.9.1. MAJCOM and NAF staff aircrew personnel assigned to positions that require them to
   perform flying duties; API-8/D, non-rated officer aircrew members, and enlisted aircrew
   members must comply with BMC requirements (paragraph 1.4.4.5).
   1.9.2. ACW and OG staff aircrew (API-6) will maintain BMC or CMR status as directed by
   the wing or operations group commander. Wing commanders, wing vice commanders,
   operations group commanders, operations group deputy commanders, and director of
   personnel will maintain BMC status, at a minimum.
   1.9.3. Training while DNIF. Crewmembers whose status is "Duty Not Involving Flying
   (DNIF)" will complete ground training events, including simulator training, if the member's
   physical condition allows. RAP events that are creditable in an Aircrew Training Device
   (ATD) may be logged when performing those events while individuals are DNIF. Consult the
   flight surgeon initiating AF Form 1042 action (prescribed by AFI 48-123, Medical
   Examinations and Standards) if the DNIF status includes ground training limitations.
   1.9.4. Inexperienced Flying Crewmembers. Supervisors will limit the non-flying duties of
   inexperienced aircrew in the first year of their initial operational assignment to duties related
   to combat activities or associated training. Examples of unrelated duties include but are not
   limited to honor guard, CFC/AFAF campaign project officer/NCO, etc. When manning
   shortages occur, priority must be given to line unit-manning positions.
       1.9.4.1. Such members may be assigned to functional shops within the squadron that
       perform flying, training or combat related activities (scheduling, training, mission
       planning, weapons and tactics, safety, intelligence, current operations, etc.).
 14                                                               AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010


   1.9.5. Aircrew entering formal flying training leading to qualification (initial or upgrade) or
   requalification will be dedicated to training responsibilities. Formal flying training
   responsibilities have priority over non-training related duties. Exception: Supervisors may
   continue normal duties as time permits. In situations where training is delayed in excess of 2
   calendar weeks, members may be assigned duties not directly related to training.
1.10. Sortie Allocation Guidance. Inexperienced aircrew members should receive sortie
allocation priority over experienced aircrew members. Priorities for sortie allocation are as
follows:
   1.10.1. Formal Training Units: Formal E-8C IQT/TX/RQ, Instructor Upgrade, Positional
   Upgrade, Instructor CT, authorized staff personnel not performing Instructor or SEFE duties.
   1.10.2. Operational Units: CMR, then BMC.
1.11. Waivers. Unless specifically noted otherwise, the OG/CC is the waiver authority for
requirements of the RTM. Additionally, the OG/CC is waiver authority for Chapters two (2),
three (3), four (4) and five (5) of this instruction. MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for all
other provisions of this volume.
   1.11.1. Waiver requests/reports. Flying squadrons will send their waiver requests and
   reports via the OSS/CC who compiles all squadron waiver requests into a single package for
   OG/CC submission to ACW/CC or HQ ACC/A3YA for approval, depending on proper
   waiver authority. SQ/CCs will use the sample waiver request letter format provided IAW
   Attachment 2.
   1.11.2. End-of-Training Cycle Waivers. Squadron commanders will forward, through
   OSS/OST to OG/CC, a list of aircrew members requesting waivers and aircrew members
   downgraded to N-CMR/N-BMC for failure to meet cycle continuation training requirements.
   All aircrew members that fail to meet end-of-cycle requirements are N-CMR/N-BMC until
   requirements are met or waived by OG/CC. Format the letter IAW Attachment 2. Waiver
   requests are due to OG/CC by the 15th of the month prior to the end of the training cycle so
   that waivers can be approved/disapproved prior to the beginning of the next training cycle.
   OST will prepare the Training Shortfall Report for the OG/CC to submit to ACC IAW
   Attachment 3. After final review and determination of waiver requests, OG/CC will notify
   subordinate units of the approval/disapproval of the waiver request. Info copy will be sent to
   HQ ACC/A3YA, HQ ACC/A3G and ANG/A3T.
AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010                                                                       15


                                           Chapter 2

                            E-8C QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. E-8C Qualification Training (QT). This chapter contains prerequisites and minimum
training requirements that are in addition to syllabus requirements. Training necessary to prepare
aircrew members to perform aircrew duties during E-8C operational and training missions is
based upon members’ first meeting the minimum requirements specified in this chapter. The
OG/CC administers E-8C QT IAW detailed objectives and requirements found in the appropriate
ACC syllabi and courseware. OG/CC is the final authority for determining the appropriate
course of training for individual students.
   2.1.1. Initial qualification training (IQT) for E-8 crew members is conducted under Total
   Systems Support Responsibility (TSSR) using contract personnel. Operational E-8 units are
   normally not equipped nor manned to support initial qualification training outside of TSSR.
   ACC/A3 and NGB/A3 are waiver authorities for IQT training conducted outside TSSR.
2.2. Formal Training Prerequisites. Prior to reporting for E-8C training, all students must
have the following:
   2.2.1. Documentation of current physiological training. Physiological training currency
   must be valid for a minimum of one month beyond scheduled training completion date.
   2.2.2. Documentation of completed or scheduled Basic Survival Training Course S-V80-A
   and Water survival Course S-V-90-A or approved equivalent.
   2.2.3. Secret Security Clearance. Top Secret Clearance paperwork submitted prior to class
   start date.
2.3. Initial Qualification Course Entry Requirements.
   2.3.1. Pilots. Minimum experience requirements for Aircraft Commander qualification track
   is 1000 hours of flight time. Pilots not meeting minimum hour requirements will be
   designated Pilots (copilot). Pilots meeting hour minimums, but without previous heavy jet
   air refueling qualification(s), have a higher than average risk of not attaining proficiency
   expectations within allowable training timelines. For those individuals who meet the
   minimum hours, but do not have prior heavy aircraft air refueling experience, the appropriate
   course (QT or TX) and track (AC or copilot) will be determined following a collaborative
   review by the OG/CD, OG/DP, OG/CDT, and CTS/CC.
   2.3.2. Flight Engineers (FEs). FEs with less than 500 flight hours will attend E-8C QT
   course. Those with greater than 500 flight hours may attend E-8C TX course.
   2.3.3. Navigators. Navigators with greater than 750 hours may attend E-8C TX course. All
   other navigators will attend the E-8C QT course.
   2.3.4. Air Battle Managers (ABMs). All ABM courses require previous qualification
   training as 13BXX. Additional requirements for QT are as follows:
       2.3.4.1. Air Weapons Officer (AWO). No additional requirements.

                                           Chapter 3

                          MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). MQT is a locally developed training
program that upgrades newly assigned aircrew from BAQ to either BMC or CMR as needed in
order to accomplish the unit mission. Guidance in this chapter provides assistance to the unit in
developing their MQT program. Units are allowed to tailor the requirements within this program
for all aircrew, based on experience, currency, documented performance, and formal training of
the individual. Squadron Commanders are responsible to ensure blocks of instruction cover
areas pertinent to the unit’s mission. MQT events previously accomplished in qualification
training (FTU or in-house) to required proficiency are creditable for MQT at the unit’s
discretion.
   3.1.1. Local MQT programs should consist only of ground and flight training applicable to
   unit taskings. Upon completion of this training, aircrew will be certified BMC or CMR by
   the SQ/CC IAW with this chapter.
   3.1.2. MQT will be completed within 90 calendar days after the completion of squadron in
   processing. If this time is exceeded, notify HQ ACC/A3Y. Training starts no later than 7
   workdays after the crewmember processes into his operational squadron and has been cleared
   for flying duties. If the crewmember elects to take leave prior to being entered into MQT,
   the timing will begin after the termination of the crewmember’s leave. Training is complete
   upon SQ/CC certification to BMC or CMR.
   3.1.3. Aircrew in MQT will not fly on Flag type missions or exercises involving other
   weapons systems where other combat ready weapons systems combine with each other to
   hone employment concepts, strategies or tactics. Exception: Technicians (i.e. ART, CST) are
   exempt from this restriction.
   3.1.4. The OG/CC will develop a process to verify that the training provided during MQT
   effectively met the training requirement. During verification each crewmember will
   demonstrate satisfactory knowledge of the squadron’s assigned mission in a standardized
   briefing format.
3.2. Ground Training. If applicable, ground training should include but is not limited to:
   3.2.1. Unit Tasking.
   3.2.2. Unit tactics and employment.
3.3. Simulator Training.
   3.3.1. Pilots, navigators and flight engineers will complete a mandatory mission-oriented
   WST/NTS simulator session that will include: heavyweight max crosswind takeoff and
   landings during low visibility conditions, night visual approaches with limited / nonexistent
   glideslope cues, and self defense maneuvers. In addition, normal instrument approaches to
   various alternate airfields and selected critical action (boldface) procedures will be
   accomplished.
 20                                                               AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010


   3.3.2. ABMs: Every effort should be made to complete a mission simulator training session
   (sim or DMO) that includes a mission-oriented scenario focusing on interdiction, CAS,
   procedural control, personnel recovery, and Link 16 battle management.
3.4. Flying Training. Units must execute a training program designed to mission qualify the
individual and prevent loss of proficiency gained at the FTU. Unit MQT programs should use
profiles typical of squadron missions. Sortie objectives are to expose individuals to the various
aspects of the unit mission and train them to required proficiency so they can accomplish the
mission. Specific flying requirements vary among E-8C crew positions and are listed in local
MQT OI(s). Unless otherwise required by individual squadrons, members are not required to re-
accomplish MQT:
   3.4.1. Following positional or instructor upgrade training.
   3.4.2. Returning from long term DNIF.
   3.4.3. Returning from AEF assignments of one year or less duration.
3.5. Transferring Between Units. BMC or CMR individuals transferring between units will
complete MQT as determined by the gaining unit commander. This training should be based on
experience, proficiency, currency, and previous formal training of the transferring individual.
AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010                                                                      21


                                           Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General. This chapter outlines continuing ground and flying training requirements for
CMR, BMC, and BAQ aircrew. Continuation Training (CT) will provide the volume, frequency,
and mix of mission-related events designed to maintain aircrew member’s applicable mission
ready status and improve the ability to accomplish the unit’s assigned mission(s). CT also
provides the necessary experiences to develop essential skills required for instructor/positional
upgrade.
   4.1.1 . In order to participate in CT aircrew members must:
       4.1.1.1. Be qualified IAW AFI 11-202V1, AFI 11-202V2, and applicable MAJCOM
       supplements
       4.1.1.2. Have completed applicable MQT.
       4.1.1.3. Be certified BMC or CMR by squadron commander or higher.
   4.1.2. Aircrew members must be BMC or CMR to receive credit for CT RAP events.
4.2. Training Cycle . The primary training period for flight and Aircrew Training Device
(ATD) CT is the 12-month Aviation Schedule (AS) or as specified in applicable RTM. The 12
month training cycle will be implemented as follows:
   4.2.1. Ground and flying training flying programs will be designed to produce training event
   accomplishment in an evenly distributed fashion across the entire training cycle.
   4.2.2. Accomplishment of cycle training events is critical to aircrew proficiency. Crew
   members will be required to complete all training events no later than the end of the
   designated training cycle.
   4.2.3. Commanders will report delinquencies to OSS/OST, who in turn will prepare and
   forward reports IAW Chapter 1 or as otherwise required.
4.3. Aircrew Ground Training. Unit commanders will ensure aircrews accomplish academic
training requirements. Commanders may direct additional training as necessary to ensure all
aircrew attain and maintain a state of proficiency permitting immediate and successful
completion of the assigned mission. An individual who instructs a class receives credit for that
academic training requirement. Ground training accomplished at the FTU or USAFWS may be
credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished, provided
member is already BMC or CMR. Ground training is comprised of the following programs:
   4.3.1. Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs)
       4.3.1.1. ATDs include the WST, NTS, MMT, and PME-MTD. ACC TRSS/Det 7 and
       116OG/CDT will determine ATD applicability for training. All ATDs will be managed
       IAW AFI 36-2248, Operations and Management of Aircrew Training Devices, and AFI
       36-2251, Management of Air Force Training Systems, or applicable ATD management
       instruction(s).
22                                                               AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010


     4.3.1.2. ATD scenarios will be based on expected employment tasking and training
     device capabilities. Emphasis should be placed on training not readily attainable during
     daily flying activities.
     4.3.1.3. Mission and Maintenance Trainer (MMT) will be used to predominantly support
     mission crew training. CT scenarios will be based on expected employment tasking and
     will use Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) to the maximum extent possible to
     accomplish integrated training.
     4.3.1.4. Individual ATD Training Cycle Requirements for various crew positions are
     listed in the RTM.
  4.3.2. Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT).         SEPT is locally developed
  training. Specific guidance will be provided by the OG/CC.
     4.3.2.1. This training will be a review and discussion of abnormal/emergency procedures
     and aircraft systems operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. Critical action
     procedures (if applicable) and squadron special interest items should be emphasized.
  4.3.3. IE01: Intelligence Training (IT). The IT program is the training program directed in
  AFI 14-2E-8V3, E-8 Unit Intelligence Procedures. The program is comprised of both
  academics and testing in the following areas: Threat Knowledge (TK), Collection and
  Reporting (C&R), Visual Recognition (Vis Recce) and Personnel Recovery (PR). IT
  academics should coincide with the Annual Training Plan (ATP) schedule and will be
  covered during training days, squadron weapons and tactics talks, and daily mission planning
  briefings. Squadrons will annotate attendance at IT briefings on an approved IT tracking
  form and turn them in to squadron ground Intel representatives at the completion of the
  briefings. Note: IT academic briefing attendance will not be entered into the ARMS database
  but will be tracked separately by ground Intel. Completion of established SERE training
  requirements will meet the IT PR academic requirements. An IT MQF will be developed by
  the External IT (EIT) Program Manager in coordination with 116 OSS/OSK and approved by
  the 116 OG/CDT. The MQF will consist of questions required to validate the IT academic
  training program. There will be three versions of the IT test based on specific crew position
  requirements. Version A will include Visual Recognition, Threat Knowledge, Personnel
  Recovery, and Collection and Reporting. The test will consist of the following question sets:
  60 TK/5 Vis Recce/5 C&R/5 PR. Version A will be applicable to Pilots, Navigators, Air
  Battle Managers, Air Intel, and Flight Engineers. Version B will include Threat Knowledge,
  Personnel Recovery, and Collection and Reporting. The test will be 60TK/5 C&R/5PR.
  Version B will be applicable to Senior Surveillance Manger and Airborne Operations
  Technicians. Version C will include Personnel Recovery and Collection and Reporting. The
  test will be 5 C&R/5PR. Version C will be applicable to Airborne Radar Technicians,
  Communication System Technicians, Deputy Mission Crew Commanders, and Airborne
  Target Surveillance Supervisors. Additional detail on the program can be found in the EIT
  Program Managers formal training plan. IE01 will be logged after successful completion of
  the IT test. IE01 is an annual requirement and will be completed prior to initial CMR
  certification. The failure to complete IE01 before expiration will result in loss of CMR status
  until the test is successfully completed (Successful completion requires a score of 85% or
  better).
AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010                                                                   23


   4.3.4. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC). Pilots and Navigators complete IRC IAW
   AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program, and AFI 11-202V1/V2. Any crewmember
   delinquent for IRC is placed on supervised status. Either an instructor pilot or instructor
   navigator, current in IRC, may supervise the delinquent crewmember until course
   completion.
   4.3.5. Senior Officer Ground Training Requirements.       Senior Officers maintaining
   CMR/BMC status will comply with requirements listed in ground training events as listed in
   the current RTM.
        4.3.5.1. Senior officers maintaining BAQ in the E-8C are required to complete, as a
        minimum, ground training listed in Table 4.1.

AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010                                                                       25


  4.8.1. The SQ/CC may prorate all flying training requirements at the end of the training
  cycle, for the reasons listed in 4.8.1.1 through 4.8.1.6.
     4.8.1.1. Long term DNIFs over 15 consecutive days;
     4.8.1.2. Emergency Leaves over 15 consecutive days
     4.8.1.3. Non-flying TDY/exercises over 15 consecutive days (example PME)
     4.8.1.4. Time spent in upgrade training. Note: Flight and ATD training accomplished
     during E-8C requalification and upgrade training does not count towards RAP
     requirements. Prorate members IAW par 4.8.3.
     4.8.1.5. Deployment preparation time where home station flights do not meet RAP
     requirements.
     4.8.1.6. Time deployed in contingency operations (paragraph 4.8.6.).
  4.8.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability in the training cycle and can
  be applied separately for each period of non-flying. Use Table 4.3 to determine the number
  of months to be prorated based on each period of consecutive calendar days non-flying.
  Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the next lower
  number, but no requirement may be prorated below one.
  4.8.3. Newly assigned aircrew members achieving initial CMR/BMC after the 15th of the
  month are considered to be in CT on the first day of the following month for proration
  purposes. Squadron SARMs will prorate events and sorties for the remainder of the training
  cycle by using the date of initial CMR status annotated on the AF Form 4324.
     4.8.3.1. For example, a BAQ aircrew member becomes CMR on the 14th of the fifth
     month of the training cycle. The individual would be prorated by the SARM for 4
     months and is responsible for meeting RAP for the fifth month. If he becomes CMR on
     the 16th of the fifth month, he would be prorated by the SARM for 5 months.
  4.8.4. When an individual completes positional upgrade (applies to ABMs, SSMs/AOTs,
  and pilots), the effective date for the new training profile entered in ARMS will be the date of
  the flight evaluation. Squadron SARMs will prorate events and sorties for the remainder of
  the training cycle by using the date of the flight evaluation.
  4.8.5. An aircrew member’s last month on station prior to departing on permanent change of
  station (PCS) or retiring may be prorated. Individuals may be considered CMR for reporting
  purposes during a period of 60 days from date of last flight or terminal leave, or until loss of
  CMR currency, port call date, or sign in at new duty station.
  4.8.6. Contingency Operation. During contingency/combat operations, ground training
  events and currencies listed in this instruction are exempted while involved in the operation
  unless specifically required in other instructions, or guidance. All sorties flown during
  contingency operations will be logged as contingency operations sorties. These sorties do
  not count toward annual RAP requirements, but will be used for lookback purposes and to
  update currencies. Units will prorate RAP missions and events for qualifying time periods
  (paragraph 4.8.1) using Table 4.3.
 26                                                               AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010

4.9. Currencies/Qualification. Ground training currencies and their impact on MR status are
listed in the RTM. Currencies for Ground Events are re-established by completing the ground
training event. HQ ACC/A3Y JSTARS RTM lists all flight currency requirements. Flight event
currency expirations greater than 6 months must be remedied IAW provisions specified in Table
4.4.
   4.9.1. Event currencies. Crew members may not instruct, evaluate or perform any event in
   which they are not qualified and current unless under instructor or supervisor supervision
   Currency may be established or updated by:
       4.9.1.1. Accomplishing the event as a qualified crew member provided member’s
       currency in the event has not expired.
       4.9.1.2. Accomplishing the event as a qualified crew member under supervision of a
       current instructor or commander approved squadron supervisor IAW paragraph 1.5.4.
       Note: Instructor Pilots are required to supervise the update of expired pilot currencies as
       required in AFI 11-202V3.
       4.9.1.3. Complying with applicable recurrency/requalification requirements in Table 4.4.
       4.9.1.4. Events satisfactorily performed on any evaluation may be used to establish or
       update currency in that event.
   4.9.2. Demonstrated Lack of Ability. If an aircrew member demonstrates a lack of ability in
   his/her current qualification, the squadron commander may downgrade the crewmember to
   unqualified per AFI 11-202V2. Re-qualification will be IAW Table 4.4 using CASE 2
   requalification guidance.
AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010                                                                      27


   4.9.3. Instructor Lack of Ability. Instructors serve solely at the discretion of Squadron
   Commanders. Instructors should exemplify a higher level of performance and present
   themselves a reliable and authoritative expert in their respective duty positions. Instructors
   exhibiting substandard performance should be reviewed for suitability of continued instructor
   duty.
      4.9.3.1. Instructors will be decertified when :
          4.9.3.1.1. Awarded a less than fully qualified grade in any area of a flight evaluation
          regardless of overall crew position qualification.
          4.9.3.1.2. Failure of a qualification, EPE, or instrument examination.
          4.9.3.1.3. Unit commander deems instructor is substandard, ineffective, or providing
          incorrect procedures, technique, or policy guidance.
      4.9.3.2. Decertified instructors may regain instructor status by correcting applicable
      deficiency and completing training and/or evaluation as specified by Sq/CC.

Operations.
4.10. CMR/BMC Regression.
  4.10.1. Regress qualified aircrew members to applicable non-MR status (N-CMR/N-BMC)
  for failure to maintain RTM lookback requirements. Unless specifically listed in the RTM,
  no other flight events or currencies will affect MR status. Revert aircrew members to
  applicable non-MR status for failure to maintain ground training currencies affecting MR
  status (see RTM).
      4.10.1.1. For aircrew members regressed to non-MR status, the SQ/CC will direct a re-
      certification program to bring the aircrew member up to CMR standards.
  4.10.2. Sortie Lookback. Only RAP training sorties, operational sorties, and upgrade
  training sorties may be used for lookback. Failure to meet 1-month RAP lookback requires a
  review of the member’s 3-month sortie history. If the 3-month lookback has been met,
  member will remain BMC/CMR. If the member also fails to meet the 3 month look back,
  one of the following SQ/CC actions is required:
      4.10.2.1. Regress the aircrew member to N-BMC/N-CMR status and establish training
      requirements to regain status within 30 days.
      4.10.2.2. Place member on 1 month probation for purpose of completing 3 month
      lookback. Failure to complete 3 month lookback at end of probation requires regression
      to N-BMC/N-CMR until 3 month lookback requirements are re-established.
      4.10.2.3. Remove the aircrew member from a CMR manning position.
      4.10.2.4. Initiate action to remove the aircrew member from active flying status.
      4.10.2.5. Lookback is determined once monthly at the beginning of each calendar month.
      For example, on the first duty day in May, the 1-month lookback is April. If the required
      number was not flown in April, review sortie history for April, March and February. If
      the required 3-month lookback numbers during this period, follow guidance in paragraph
      4.10.2.1.
AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010                                                                      29


      4.10.2.6. Following MQT and/or establishment of a CMR date, all aircrew will meet the
      1-month lookback to maintain CMR status until a 3-month lookback history is
      established. If an individual fails to meet the 1-month lookback before they establish a 3-
      month lookback, they will either be regressed to N-CMR or they may, at the SQ/CC’s
      discretion, be given a 15 day extension to meet 1 month lookback. Extensions will be
      noted on the N-CMR/N-BMC letter.
      4.10.2.7. Contingency sorties will count for lookback purposes for all aircrew positions
      when determining CMR status for returning deployers.
   4.10.3. N-CMR/N-BMC letters are accomplished by the Squadron DOT shops IAW
   116OSS/OST guidance at the beginning of each month and should be submitted to OST.
4.11. Restrictions for N-BMC/N-CMR.
   4.11.1. Aircrew members that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status may not deploy to an
   overseas exercise or real-world contingency as an operational aircrew member. The member
   may deploy in a ground position (Joint Services Work Station (JSWS) Operator, Liaison
   Officer (LNO), Mission Planning Team, etc.) provided they meet theater-specific ground
   training requirements. Note: This requirement does not apply to E-8 ferry operations.
4.12. Establishing/Regaining CMR/BMC Status.
   4.12.1. Once requisite ground and flying training is accomplished, Squadron DOT will
   accomplish a ―CMR/BMC‖ memo IAW 116OSS/OST guidance documenting the
   satisfactory completion of training and recommending return of individual to applicable MR
   status. SQ/CC signed memorandum is the sole document removing and restoring individuals
   to appropriate MR status. Memorandums will be filed in the individual’s training records.
4.13. Delinquencies (Failure to Complete Required Training).
   4.13.1. Aircrew members who fail to meet RAP requirements by the end of the training
   cycle will be downgraded to N-CMR/N-BMC. Unless waived IAW paragraph 1.11.2,
   remaining training requirements must be made up during the next RAP training cycle and
   aircrew member will remain N-CMR/N-BMC until the non-waived sorties/events are
   accomplished. These sorties/events will be allowed to count for the new training cycle.
   Accomplishment of any delinquent training will be tracked manually and documented in the
   aircrew member’s training record. Currency dates will be carried over to the next cycle. In
   the case of new RAP requirements, initial currency date will be the first day of the training
   cycle. If the name of an event changes, but the definition/intent is the same, the currency
   date of the similar event from the previous cycle will be used for the new event.

                                            Chapter 5

                       UPGRADE (UGT)/SPECIALIZED TRAINING

5.1. General. This chapter establishes formal instructions for training designed to qualify an E8
crewmember into a crew position or certification other than what the member currently holds.
Upgrade eligibility criteria and training events provide the member adequate preparation needed
to meet qualification standards for the intended upgrade crew position.
5.2. UGT Selection Policy. Candidates will be selected for upgrade training based upon their
demonstrated ability, experience, and potential to successfully assume increased responsibility
and performance. In addition, instructor candidate selection must be based upon the candidates’
demonstrated flying skills, potential to instruct, technical knowledge, and needs of the OG. For
all upgrades, completion of training prerequisites (i.e. ground training, CAT 1, etc.) specified in
this chapter are mandatory and must be completed prior to reporting to the FTU (if applicable)
for CAT II type training unless waived by the OG/CC.
5.3. Extensions. Failure to complete training within 120 days of the first flight (240 days for
traditional ANG personnel) requires notification to HQ ACC/A3Y (info copy ACC/A3G and
ANG/A3O) with aircrew member's name, rank, reason for the delay, planned actions and
estimated completion date.
5.4. Upgrade Training Categories. Upgrade training qualifies crewmembers into an
authorized E-8 crew position other than that currently held. All upgrade training is divided into
two categories: Category I (CAT I) and Category II (CAT II). CAT I training is an in-unit
program consisting of ground and flight training events that may lead to follow-on USAF
directed formal training hereafter referred to as CAT II training. CAT II is the formal course of
training as dictated in the appropriate ACC syllabus. When applicable, CAT I is a prerequisite to
CAT II training and must be started and completed within a 60-day training period immediately
preceding CAT II training initiation.
   5.4.1. Category 1 Training (CAT I). CAT I training will be conducted by individual
   squadrons with a qualified instructor and monitored by DOT. Training will consist of ground
   and flight training events designed to ensure student candidates possess the ability and
   potential to successfully assume responsibility and performance of the intended qualification
   prior to entering the formal (CAT II) portion of upgrade training. CAT I training event
   completions are mandatory and are prerequisites for entering CAT II unless waived by the
   OG/CC.
       5.4.1.1. Aircrew members submitted for positional upgrade training will meet minimum
       experience requirements specified in this chapter for the crew position prior to beginning
       CAT II training. All training events and flying hours accomplished in CAT I are
       creditable towards positional upgrade pre-requisites.
       5.4.1.2. Training Recency. Training will begin no earlier than 60 days prior to start of
       CAT II training and will be completed NLT 1 day prior to start of CAT II. Crew
       members will not enter formal (CAT II) training until all CAT I designated training has
       been completed.
AFI11-2E-8V1 7 JUNE 2010                                                                      31


       5.4.1.3. Waiver coordination for items not completed in CAT I must be sent to OG/CD-
       T. Waiver(s) must be approved by the OG/CC and the FTU unit commander prior to
       beginning CAT II training.
       5.4.1.4. CAT I specific grading criteria and training events are found in Attachments 7, 8
       and 9. Members must satisfy minimum performance criteria specified prior to
       completing CAT I training.
       5.4.1.5. Failure or inability to satisfactorily complete CAT I training will result in
       removal from upgrade training. AFI 11-402 procedures do not apply to members
       removed from CAT I training.
   5.4.2. Category II Training (CAT II). CAT II training will consist of academic, ATD, and
   flying training conducted by the CTS and IAW the ACC-approved syllabus. All CAT II
   training is considered formal training. Personnel upgrading in an aircraft will incur an
   ADSC IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC).
       5.4.2.1. CAT II flying training may be conducted out-of-cycle and in-unit with OG/CC
       approval provided the following actions are sequentially completed:
           5.4.2.1.1. Step 1. SQ/CC will ensure both academic and ATD requirements can be
           completed utilizing unit instructors. Instructors must be FTU (PFT) certified to
           conduct CAT II training. If unit instructor manning is not sufficient, contact the
           116OG/CD-T (or Director of Training) for availability of contractor support.
           5.4.2.1.2. Step 2. Once instructor availability has been determined, Sq/CC will route
           the submission of an out-of-cycle training plan and approval request (Attachment 5)
           through the 116 OG/ CD-T / CD for coordination.
           5.4.2.1.3. Step 3. After OG staff coordination, the OG/CC or his designated
           representative will approve / disapprove out of cycle upgrade requests by signature.
       5.4.2.1.4. Failure to Meet Training Standards (CAT II). Failure to meet academic or
       flying standards while enrolled in a USAF directed formal flying training course
       (includes instructor and positional upgrade) requires an examination of the aircrew
       member’s potential for continued aviation service. When rated officers or career enlisted
       aviators fail to meet training standards, the only acceptable method of removal from
       formal flying courses is through a Flight Evaluation Board (FEB) or FEB waiver. Refer
       to AFI 11-402.

aircrew members, flying SQ/CC and SQ/DO positions are designated CMR positions. OG/CCs
may designate other API-6 positions not assigned to the flying squadron as CMR. CMR aircrew
will maintain proficiency and qualification in all core missions of the flying unit to which they
are assigned or attached. CMR aircrew maintain currencies which affect CMR status, accomplish
all core designated flight training (sorties and events), and all mission ground training. Failure to
complete this training or maintain these currencies results in regression to N-CMR status.
Continuation Training (CT).—Training designed to maintain proficiency and improve aircrew
capabilities to perform unit missions.
Course Training Document (CTD).—Documented guidance for a particular training course
that includes a synopsis of training, resource requirements, and equipment allocations.
Direct Supervision.—An aircrew member is considered under direct supervision when another
crew member of like specialty has the capability to immediately assume the primary crew duties.
A pilot under direct supervision of another pilot means the supervising pilot occupies a set of
flight controls. For all other crew positions, the supervising individual must be readily available
to assume the primary duties if required.
Dual Status.—A term when combined with crew 2 crew positions (i.e. MCC/SD) identifies crew
members who maintain a primary crew position qualification but may also fly and fulfill duties
of another crew position in which they were previously qualified.
Event.—The accomplishment of a specific training element, function, or task.

Flight Instructor Course.—Basic Instructor Academics. E-8C specific academics and crew
position specific academics.
Formal School Courseware.—Training materials and programs developed for training aircrew
members at formal schools. It includes all student study guides, workbooks, computer-based
training lessons, slide tape lessons, and instructor guides related to the specific course.
Inexperienced/Experienced (I/E) Aircrew.—A designation used to determine the level of
training a crewmember receives within each RAP level.
Instructor CRM.—One-time training event required of all E-8C instructors prior to assuming
duties as an instructor.
Look back.—Based on a RAP sortie; calculated on a calendar month basis.
Mission Ready Status.—Abbreviated term denoting BMC and CMR.
Proficiency.—Demonstrated ability to successfully accomplish tasked event safely and
effectively. For purposes of this instruction, proficiency also requires currency in the event, if
applicable. Currency and proficiency may or may not be synonymous.
QUAL.—Aircrew has demonstrated to an instructor / evaluator the capability to accomplish the
event.
Ready Aircrew Program (RAP).—The CT program designed to focus on ground and flying
training to accomplish a unit's basic tasked missions in support of worldwide tasking. Applies
only to BMC and CMR crew members.
RAP Tasking Memorandum.—A MAJCOM coordinated document usually produced prior
each training cycle used to tailor specific training events, frequencies, currencies, and rules for
crediting training events. The RTM allows customization of training within the confines of the
parent training instruction.
Specialized Training.—Specialized Training. Specialized training is training in any special skill
necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned missions that is not required of every crewmember.
Specialized training consists of upgrade training (instructor and positional upgrade) and may
consist of certain continuation events.
