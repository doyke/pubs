                                    FLAGS AND PLATES

2.1. Purpose. This chapter prescribes guidance/procedures for the display, disposition, and use
of flags, guidons, streamers, and automobile and aircraft plates. Only the flags, guidons,
streamers, and automobile and aircraft plates described in this chapter are authorized for use in
the Air Force and on Air Force installations.
2.2. Design. Design elements appear on both sides of flags and guidons with the image on the
opposite side appearing as a mirror image (letters and numerals read from left to right on both
sides).
2.3. Materials. Flags designed primarily for indoor and parade display will normally be made
of banner rayon or heavyweight nylon with rayon fringe. Those designed primarily for outdoor
display will be made of nylon-wool or heavyweight nylon without fringe. Older flags, made
exclusively of wool, should be used until no longer serviceable and then replaced with flags
made of newer synthetic materials.
2.4. Restrictions. The following limitations and prohibitions are applicable to flags, guidons
and streamers.
   2.4.1. Carrying of non-military organizational flags. United States military personnel in
   uniform or in civilian clothing, acting in an official capacity, will not carry flags of veterans
   groups or other non-military organizations; commanders may, however, authorize military
   personnel to carry state, territorial or national flags during military ceremonies. United
   States military personnel in uniform are authorized to carry all Department of Defense
   recognized flags.
   2.4.2. Unserviceable flags. Unserviceable flags will not be used as banners or for any other
   purpose. When a flag is no longer suitable for display, it will not be cast aside or used in any
   way that may be viewed as disrespectful. Unserviceable flags should be destroyed in a
   dignified manor, preferably by burning, in a way that does not show irreverence or disrespect
   to the flag. Additional information on the destruction of unserviceable flags is provided in
   AFPAM 34-1202, Guide to Protocol, Chapter 2.
   2.4.3. Serviceable flags. Serviceable flags purchased with appropriated funds are not to be
   sold, loaned or donated to non-military persons or organizations. This restriction does not
   prohibit the presentation of flags to families upon the death of a military member at a funeral
   or other appropriate setting (consult with your comptroller and staff judge advocate).
2.5. Authorized flags and plates. Flags and plates are authorized for positions or individuals as
prescribed in this publication.
2.6. Design of Official Emblems. For flags of organizations authorized emblems, refer to AFI
84-105, Organizational Lineage, Honors, and Heraldry, for design, approval and construction.

   2.7.4. The flag of the United States will always be displayed or carried in ceremonies when

 12                                                                AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013


2.10. Position and Manner of Display. The following rules will be observed in accordance
with Title 4 United States Code, Section 7:
   2.10.1. When carried in a procession with another flag or flags, the flag of the United States
   should be either on the marching right; that is, to the flag‗s own right (to the far right of all
   others), or, if there is a line of other flags, in front of the center line (Figure 2.1). This is also
   correct when flags are displayed in a stationary position. Flags carried by troops are never at
   half-staff.

Figure 2.1. Flag of the United States Carried in Processions with Another Flag




   2.10.2. The flag of the United States, when it is displayed with another flag against a wall
   from crossed staffs, should be on the right, the flag‗s own right (observer‗s left), and its staff
   should be in front of the staff of the other flag (Figure 2.2).

Figure 2.2. Flag of the United States Displayed and Another Flag Displayed with Crossed
Staffs.




   2.10.3. When the flag of the United States is displayed from a flagstaff with other flags, the
   following applies:
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                       13


       2.10.3.1. When a number of flags are grouped and displayed from staffs radiating from a
       central point, and no foreign flags are in the display, the flag of the United States will be
       in the center and at the highest point of the group as shown in Figure 2.3

Figure 2.3. Flag of the United States Displayed with Other Flags Radiating from a Central
Point.




       2.10.3.2. When a number of flags are displayed from staffs set in a line, all staffs will be
       of the same height and have the same style finials, or decorative devices, at the top of the
       flagpoles (Services specific guidance may differ in a joint environment.) Paragraph
       2.35.2 provides additional guidance on finials. The flag of the United States will be at
       the right, which is to the left of an observer facing the display (Figure 2.4). However, if
       no foreign national flags are involved in the display, the flag of the United States may be
       placed at the center of the line providing it is displayed at a higher level than the other
       flags in the display (Figure 2.5).

Figure 2.4. Flag of the United States Displayed in a Line with Other Flags at Equal Height.
 14                                                           AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013


Figure 2.5. Flag of the United States Displayed in a Line with Other Flags at Lower Level.




   2.10.4. When flags of states, cities, or localities, or pennants of societies are flown on the
   same halyard (rope for raising or lowering) with the flag of the United States, the flag of the
   United States should always be at the peak. When the flags are flown from adjacent staffs,
   the flag of the United States should be hoisted first and lowered last. No flag or pennant may
   be placed (flown) above the flag of the United States, except during church services
   conducted by naval chaplains at sea, when the church pennant may be flown above the flag
   during church services for the personnel of the Navy. When the flag of the United States is
   flown at half-staff for an official observance, foreign national flags may be above the flag of
   the United States.
   2.10.5. When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they are to be flown from separate
   staffs of the same height. The flags should be of equal size. International usage prescribes
   the display of the flag of one nation equal to that of another nation in time of peace. The
   flags will be displayed in a line, alphabetically, using the English alphabet, with the flag of
   the United States at its own right (the observer‗s left). When in North Atlantic Treaty
   Organization (NATO) countries, NATO member country flags are displayed in French
   alphabetical order. Air Force commanders obtain instructions on the use and display of flags
   in foreign countries from the office of the United States Defense Attaché located in the U.S.
   Embassy. In the absence of such an office, contact the senior Air Force officer on duty in the
   foreign country concerned. The Defense Attaché or senior Air Force officer formulates
   standardized instructions in keeping with existing treaties and arrangements or practices
   otherwise agreeable to the host country. Inquiries relating to display of flags in foreign
   countries may be directed to Headquarters U.S. Air Force, International Affairs Division,
   AF/CVAI.
   2.10.6. When the flag of the United States is displayed from a staff projecting horizontally or
   at an angle from the windowsill, balcony or front of a building, the union of the flag should
   be placed at the peak of the staff (Figure 2.6). When the flag is suspended over a sidewalk
   from a rope extending from a house to a pole at the edge of the sidewalk, the flag should be
   hoisted out, union first, from the building (Figure 2.7).
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                  15


Figure 2.6. Flag of the United States Displayed at an Angle from a Building.




Figure 2.7. Flag of the United States Suspended over a Sidewalk.




   2.10.7. When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be
   uppermost and to the flag‗s own right, that is, to the observer‗s left (Figure 2.8). When
   displayed in a window, the flag should be displayed in the same way, with the union (or blue
   field) to the left of the observer in the street.
 16                                                           AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013


Figure 2.8. Flag of the United States Displayed Against a Wall.




   2.10.8. When the flag is displayed over the middle of the street, it should be suspended
   vertically with the union to the north on an east and west street or to the east on a north and
   south street (Figure 2.9).

Figure 2.9. Flag of the United States Display Over the Middle of the Street.




   2.10.9. When used on a speaker‗s platform, the flag, if displayed flat, should be displayed
   above and behind the speaker. When displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium,
   the flag of the United States should hold the position of superior prominence and in the
   position of honor at the clergyman‗s or speaker‗s right as he faces the audience. Any other
   flag so displayed should be placed on the left of the clergyman or speaker or to the right of
   the audience (Figure 2.10). The flag should always be positioned at the same level or above
   as the clergyman or speaker, never at a lower floor level. When the flag is not on stage but
   placed on the floor in front of the stage, the flag is to the right of the audience.
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                     17


Figure 2.10. Flag of the United States on Stage with Speaker.




   2.10.10. The flag should never be used as the covering for a statue or monument.
   2.10.11. When the flag is suspended across a corridor or lobby in a building with only one
   main entrance, it should be suspended vertically with the union of the flag to the observer‗s
   left upon entering. If the building has more than one main entrance, the flag should be
   suspended vertically near the center of the corridor or lobby with the union to the north,
   when entrances are to the east and west or to the east when entrances are to the north and
   south. This includes aircraft hangars. It is permitted to have U.S. flag/color team display for
   ceremonial events in front of and in addition to a large permanently affixed U.S. Flag
   displayed in a building or hangar (Figure 2.11).

Figure 2.11. Flag of the United States/Colors with permanently affixed U.S. Flag display
 18                                                              AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013


   2.10.12. No flag or pennant may be placed (flown) above the flag of the United States or to
   the right of the American Flag, except during church services conducted by naval chaplains
   at sea, when the church pennant may be flown above the flag during church services for the
   personnel of the Navy. Flags of other nations are flown or displayed in equal size and on
   poles of equal height, and are never flown below the flag of the United States. While the
   preferred and most traditional method is to fly flags at outside venues on individual flag
   poles, the U.S. Flag Code does permit flags of cities, states, localities, organizations (i.e.
   USAF, MAJCOM, NAF, or Wing flags), pennants of societies or special flags such as
   commemorative/AF Anniversary, Minuteman, or Prisoner of War/Missing in Action
   (POW/MIA) flags to be flown on the same halyard with the United States flag. They should
   be fastened to the halyard at a distance below the United States Flag so that when both are at
   rest the flag of the United States does not touch or overlap the second flag (see Figure 2.12).
   When the flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the flag of the United States should be hoisted
   first and lowered last.

Figure 2.12. Flag of the United States with Minuteman Flag.




   2.10.13. When three flagstaffs are positioned outside a building, there may be two display
   options. If the flagstaffs are in a straight line, then the flags should be of the same height with
   the flag of the United States to its own right. Use the building looking out to the flags as the
   point of reference for flag placement when flags are in line. If the flag is positioned on the
   center staff, then the center staff must be higher than the other two staffs.
   2.10.14. On a closed casket, the flag will be placed lengthwise, with the union at the head
   and over the left shoulder of the deceased (Figure 2.13). When a full-couch casket is
   opened, the flag will be removed, folded to the triangular shape of a cocked hat and placed in
   the lid at the head end of the casket and just above the decedent‗s left shoulder. When a half-
   couch casket is opened, the flag will be folded on the lower half of the casket in the same
   relative position as when displayed full length on a closed casket. The flag will not be
   lowered into the grave, and it will not be allowed to touch the ground. The interment flag
   may be given to the next of kin at the conclusion of the interment.
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                       19


Figure 2.13. Flag of the United States Draped over a Closed Casket.




   2.10.15. The flag will be draped left to right when posted and when used in official
   photographs. The blue field should be on top with stripes running left to right.
   2.10.16. When painted or displayed on an aircraft or vehicle, the union is toward the front
   and the stripes trail.
2.11. Order of Precedence of Flags. The following is the order of precedence of flags:
   2.11.1. The flag of the United States.
   2.11.2. Foreign national flags. Normally, these are displayed in alphabetical order using the

organizational or institutional flags are always dipped as a mark of respect to the flag of the
United States. During arrival honors, as appropriate for persons listed in Attachment 2, the flag

   monument. (Figure 2.14)
 22                                                            AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013

   2.12.3. The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.
   2.12.4. The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should
   never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, or in folds, but always allowed to fall free (e.g., the
   flag should not be used to cover a speaker‗s podium, drape the front of a platform or for other
   decoration. A proper substitute is bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the
   blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below. (Figure 2.15)

   use and discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the
   flag is flown.
   2.12.10. No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However,
   a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firefighters, police officers,
   and members of patriotic organizations. A lapel flag pin, being a replica of the flag, should
   be worn on the left lapel near the heart. Patches worn on uniforms depicting the United
   States Flag should be worn on the left shoulder, with the union to the viewers left.

   (observer‗s left) of the flag of the United States, except during church services conducted by
   naval chaplains at sea, when the church pennant may be flown above the flag during church
   services for the personnel of the Navy.
2.13. Display of the United States Flag at Half-Staff. The United States flag shall be flown at
half-staff throughout the United States and its territories and possessions in accordance with
DoDI 1005.06, Display of the National Flag at Half-Staff.
   2.13.1. The following days apply:
       2.13.1.1. On Memorial Day until noon, then raised to the top of the staff.
       2.13.1.2. On Peace Officers Memorial Day, May 15 of each year, unless that day is also
       Armed Forces Day.
       2.13.1.3. On Patriot Day, September 11 of each year.
       2.13.1.4. On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, December 7 of each year.
       2.13.1.5. Each year in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service
       according to Public Law 107-51. This date is usually the first Sunday in October and is
       announced annually by Presidential Proclamation.
       2.13.1.6. On the death of individuals in accordance with Attachment 3.
       2.13.1.7. When so directed by the President of the United States, the SecDef, Governor
       of any State, territory, or U.S. possession, or the Mayor of the District of Columbia.
   2.13.2. The responsible military commander shall ensure the procedures for flying the flag at
   half-staff are executed as follows:
       2.13.2.1. The term half-staff means the position of the flag when it is one-half the
       distance between the top and bottom of the staff.
       2.13.2.2. The flag, when flown at half-staff, shall first be hoisted to the peak for an
       instant and then lowered to the half-staff position. The flag shall be again raised to the
       peak before it is lowered for the day.
 24                                                             AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013


   2.13.3. The flag shall be flown at half-staff outside the United States on DoD buildings,
   grounds, and naval vessels even if another nation‘s flag is flown full-staff next to the flag of
   the United States.
   2.13.4. All flags displayed with the flag of the United States should be flown at half-staff
   when the flag of the United States is flown at half-staff with the exception of foreign national
   flags.
   2.13.5. The Heads of the DoD Components may direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on
   buildings, grounds, or naval vessels under their jurisdiction on occasions other than those
   specified in paragraph 2.13.1 and Attachment 3, when they consider it proper and
   appropriate. Within the Air Force, this authority is delegated to the installation commander.
   Any time an installation commander decides to fly the flag at half-staff based on this local
   authority for a local death, the base marquee(s) should state the reason to avoid confusion.
2.14. Hoisting and Lowering the United States Flag. During the ceremony of hoisting or
lowering the flag, all persons present, except those in formation, should face the flag and stand at
attention. Those present in uniform should stand at attention and render the military salute.
When not in uniform, stand at attention with the right hand over the heart. If headgear is worn,
remove it with the right hand and hold at the left shoulder, with the hand being over the heart.
Non-U.S. citizens should stand at attention. When the flag is lowered from the staff, no portion
of it is allowed to touch the ground in either lowering or folding. The flag is detached from the
halyard and folded as prescribed in Attachment 3.
2.15. Flag Folding Ceremony. This paragraph discusses folding the flag of the United States at
ceremonies other than military funerals. According to Title 4 United States Code, there is no
specific meaning assigned to the folds of the flag. Although there are flag folding ceremony
options offered by various national interest groups, these are not official Air Force ceremonies.
The Air Force developed a script that provides a historical perspective on the flag. There are no
ceremonies in the Air Force requiring a script to be read when the flag is folded. However, when
a flag folding ceremony is desired and conducted by Air Force personnel at any location, on or
off an installation, this script is the only one that may be used. This includes printing in
programs and/or any handouts. See Attachment 4 for this script and a diagram depicting the
proper method for folding the flag of the United States.
2.16. Ceremonial Reviews. Render proper courtesies to the flag during parades or passes in
review:
   2.16.1. When in a moving column, the salute should be rendered six paces before passing the
   flag and held until six paces past the flag.
   2.16.2. When attending ceremonial reviews, personnel in uniform should render a salute as
   the flag passes their position. Personnel not in uniform should stand at attention and place
   their right hand over their heart.
2.17. National Anthem. Title 36 United States Code, Section 301 provides guidance on
conduct during the playing of the national anthem. The national anthem, first verse, is the only
song authorized for playing at Air Force ceremonies when colors are presented. ―God Bless
America‖ or other patriotic songs will not be substituted for the nation anthem.
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                      25


   2.17.1. Outdoors. When the flag is displayed, all present except those in formation, should
   stand at attention facing the flag with their right hand over their heart. Members of the
   Armed Forces and veterans who are present, but not in uniform, may render the military
   salute. All others should remove their hat with their right hand and hold the headdress at the
   left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Individuals in uniform should give the military
   salute at the first note of the national anthem and maintain that position until the last note.
   When the flag is not displayed, all present should face toward the music and act in the same
   manner they would if the flag were displayed.
   2.17.2. Indoors. Military members in uniform, while in formations, should wear appropriate
   headgear and render the military salute at the first note of the national anthem and maintain
   that position until the last note. While not wearing headgear during an indoor ceremony,
   military members, in formation or not, should stand at attention at the first note of the
   national anthem and maintain that position until the last note without rendering the military
   salute. There is one exception to this. Military members in uniform, under arms, should
   salute. Civilians should stand at attention facing the flag with their right hand over their
   heart.
   2.17.3. During the playing of national anthems of friendly nations, military members and
   civilians should render the same customs and courtesies as those given during the playing of
   the United States national anthem.
       2.17.3.1. The performance of the national anthem of any foreign country will be
       followed, without pause, by playing the national anthem of the United States. When two
       or more foreign national anthems are played, the United States national anthem is
       performed last.
       2.17.3.2. Anthems of the United States or anthems of any foreign nations are never
       incorporated into any musical arrangement, composition, or medley and must be played
       through without repetition of any part except as required to make both the words and
       music complete.
       2.17.3.3. When OCONUS, check with the legal office regarding local country agreement
       requirements for the playing of foreign national anthems.
2.18. Pledge of Allegiance. The Pledge of Allegiance to the flag, ―I pledge allegiance to the
flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under
God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all‖ should be rendered by standing at attention and
facing the flag. When not in uniform, persons should remove any non-religious headdress with
their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, with the hand being over the heart. Persons in
uniform should remain silent, face the flag, and render the military salute if outdoors and indoors
if in formation and wearing appropriate headdress. If indoors and without headdress, military
members should stand at attention, remain silent, and face the flag. Military members in uniform
do not recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.
2.19. To The Color. ―To The Color‖ is not the national anthem; it is a bugle call that is
occasionally played instead of the national anthem, although it is not recommended as a
replacement to the national anthem. During ―To The Color‖, military members and civilians
should render the same customs and courtesies as those given to the playing of the national
anthem.
 26                                                             AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013


2.20. Taps. Taps began as a signal to extinguish lights (lights out) at the end of the day. Many
Air Force installations play Taps to signify lights out or to begin quiet hours. For these purposes,
there is no formal protocol procedures required. However, upon hearing Taps at a military
ceremony (military funeral/memorial ceremony), proper protocol dictates those individuals in
uniform render appropriate honors, indoor or outdoor, until the music is complete. Civilians
should remove their headgear and place their hand over their heart.
2.21. Reveille and Retreat. When Reveille or Retreat is played simply as a bugle call to signal
the beginning or end of the duty day, no courtesies are required. If Reveille or Retreat is played
as a prelude to the national anthem or ―To The Color,‖ or if the flag is being lowered or raised,
render courtesies as outlined in paragraph 8.1.6.2. For more detailed information on reveille and
retreat ceremonies, see AFMAN 36-2203, Drill and Ceremonies.
2.22. United States Air Force Departmental Flag. This section describes the United States
Air Force Departmental Flag (Figure 2.16). The departmental flag is made of rayon or synthetic
substitute material, ultramarine blue in color. The distinctive center design is the Air Force Coat
of Arms and the encircling 13 white stars from the Seal of the Department of the Air Force.
United States Air Force is inscribed on a scroll attached to the bottom of the shield. The design
of the United Air Force Departmental Flag appears on both sides of the flag. The design is
reversed on the reverse side of the flag (it is backwards on the reverse side), but all lettering
reads correctly from left to right on both sides. The eagle always faces toward the staff on both
sides. There are two authorized sizes of the United States Air Force Departmental Flag: The
ceremonial (4 feet 4 inches by 5 feet 6 inches) is authorized for optional use with streamers. The
smaller Air Force flag (3 feet by 4 feet) will not be used with streamers. Uses and descriptions
for each size are detailed below. These provisions also apply to Air Force Reserve and Air
National Guard organizations.

Figure 2.16. United States Air Force Departmental Flag.




   2.22.1. The ceremonial size United States Air Force Departmental Flag, with or without
   streamers, is 4 feet 4 inches by 5 feet 6 inches, and is trimmed on three edges with a rayon
   fringe of yellow 2 inches wide. The ceremonial size of the United States Air Force
   Departmental Flag also serves as the HQ USAF flag.
   2.22.2. The size of the United States Flag should determine the appropriate size of the Air
   Force flag used when displaying them together. Both sizes of the Air Force flag match
   approved sizes of the United States Flag and Air Force positional flags (see paragraph 2.27)
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                       27


   which makes displaying them together easier. Consideration should always be given to
   ensure appropriate respect to the flag of the United States.
   2.22.3. The United States Air Force Departmental Flag, either size, (ceremonial size
   optionally with or without streamers), may be displayed only when representing the
   Department of the Air Force on State and official occasions. It may be used at joint
   command headquarters, joint service schools, and similar joint activities where the United
   States Air Force is a participant or is represented. Its use is authorized on such other
   occasions as may be recommended by installation commanders.
   2.22.4. Each MAJCOM is authorized one ceremonial-sized United States Air Force
   Departmental Flag with streamers for permanent indoor use and display at its headquarters.
   2.22.5. The 3 feet by 4 feet version of the Air Force Departmental Flag is identical in design
   to the ceremonial size, but is displayed without streamers. This smaller version may be used
   on all occasions the larger ceremonial flag may be used; however, it is not to be used with
   streamers. Its size matches identically with the size of the general officers‘ flags and the Air
   Force Senior Executive Service flag and should be used in ceremonies or events in which all
   flags need to be of the same size.
   2.22.6. When displayed with departmental flags of other United States military services,
   precedence is as follows: Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard.
   2.22.7. When displayed or carried with flags of other Air Force organizations, foreign
   national flags, or State flags, the order of precedence is as follows: The United States flag,
   foreign national flags, state flags, Air Force flag, and flags of other Air Force organizations.
   2.22.8. The Air Force departmental flag is an organizational flag and is dipped while the
   national anthem, ―To The Color‖, musical honors for CSAF or higher, or a foreign national
   anthem is played. The Departmental Flag is also dipped when rendering honors to the SecAF,
   the CSAF, their direct representative, or any government official of equivalent or higher
   grade, including foreign dignitaries, and during a pass in review. Additionally, the
   departmental flag and other subordinate flags will be dipped during military funeral honors.
   This includes the movement and transfer of the remains, the playing of ―muffled ruffles‖ and
   Taps. The departmental flag will not be dipped under any other circumstances.
2.23. Organizational Flags. Design and Description: Organizational flags are rayon or
synthetic substitute material, ultramarine blue field, 3 feet by 4 feet, trimmed on three edges with
a fringe of yellow rayon 2 inches wide. The shield contains the organizational emblem, and the
scroll beneath contains the organization‗s designation. The design on organizational flags
appears on both sides of the flag. However, the design is reversed on the reverse side of the flag,
but all lettering reads correctly from the left to right on both sides. The eagle always faces
toward the staff on both sides.
   2.23.1. Authorization and Display: Organizational heraldry (including flags) on a shield
   type emblem is authorized for units with a headquarters designation and is used on
   ceremonial occasions when the organization is represented. Organizational flags are kept at
   the headquarters to which issue is authorized. There are two authorized ways to display
   organizational flags of several commands. When they are displayed in a group, they can be
   displayed either alphabetically or numerically, as applicable, within groupings of each
 28                                                           AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013


   echelon or command. The host commander is the authorized authority to determine display.
   The host flag is displayed at the center of the groupings.
       2.23.1.1. Headquarters Air Force, major commands, numbered air forces, centers, wings,
       groups, and comparable organizations having a headquarters component shall have their
       approved emblem design placed/positioned on the shield and their designation positioned
       on the scroll. Refer to AFI 84-105 for further discussion on authorized unit emblems.
       2.23.1.2. Groups and comparable organizations having a headquarters component, if
       permanently assigned and aligned with a higher echelon (groups to wings, or centers to
       Air Force Materiel Command, as examples) may use the emblem design of the higher
       echelon, with their own unit designation on the scroll.
       2.23.1.3. Organizations authorized a flag, which do not have approved emblems, shall
       use the provisional flag (Figure 2.17). The words "United States Air Force" appear on
       the scroll.

Figure 2.17. United States Air Force Provisional Flag with United States Air Force Flag.




       2.23.1.4. Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) units use the coat of arms or
       emblem from the seal of the university with the school designation on the scroll.
2.24. Deleted.
2.25. Religious Flags. The following guidelines apply:
   2.25.1. Chaplain Service Flag. The Chaplain Service flag is blue, with the chaplain emblem
   in the center and yellow fringe along three edges, 2 inches in length. The flag is available in
   two sizes, 4 feet 4 inches by 5 feet 6 inches and 3 feet by 4 feet. The Chaplain Service flag
   represents the accommodation of religious expression and a commitment to the free exercise
   of religion.
   2.25.2. The Chaplain Service flag may be displayed at military formations, gatherings, and
   ceremonies, even those not specifically religious in nature. During the conduct of religious
   services or ceremonies, religious flags may be displayed as appropriate to ensure accurate
   representation of the religious orientation of the service or ceremony. These religious flags
   should be removed following the service or ceremony. The Chaplain Service flag should be
   displayed at all times in chapels on Air Force installations.
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                      29


2.26. Positional Flags. Certain civilian and military officials of the United States government
are entitled, by virtue of their official status or position, to have individual flags representing
their official position within the government. These flags are kept in the office of the person to
whom issue is authorized. Positional flags are often displayed at ceremonies only when the
distinguished person for whom it represents is present and has a role in the ceremony or event.
They are not intended to be flown from outdoor flagpoles or on buildings. However, they may
be displayed during outdoor ceremonies, pre-positioned or hand held. Positional flags for Air
Force personnel are 4 feet 4 inches by 5 feet 6 inches. Positional flags of primary concern to the
Air Force are listed below.
   2.26.1. President of the United States. This flag is blue, 4 feet 4 inches by 5 feet 6 inches
   and trimmed on three edges with a fringe of silver and gold bullion, 2½ inches wide. The

Figure 2.30. Assistant Secretaries and General Counsel of the Air Force.




2.27. Individual Flags or Personal Colors. General officers are authorized flags depicting
their rank.
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                      35


  2.27.1. General/Flag Officer personal colors (Figure 2.31) are made of rayon or synthetic
  substitute material. These flags are 3 feet by 4 feet, trimmed on three sides with a 2½ inch
  yellow fringe. They will be blue (Air Force/Navy) or red (Army/Marine Corps) for the main
  line of the service, but other variations do exist for non-line career fields (i.e. Army medical
  and Chaplain Service, Navy Staff Corps). Consult specific service regulations for non-line
  specifications. All will bear the number of five-pointed white stars that identify the grade of
  the officer within the field. Placement of the stars is shown below. Note that the layout of
  the white stars is the same for Air Force/Army and Navy/Marine Corps respectively.
  General officer flags can be used at ceremonies when the officer whom it represents is
  officiating or participating in the event. Personal colors are not displayed for general officers
  attending, but not participating in the event. General officers are entitled to the issue of one
  ceremonial flag for each general officer rank to which they are promoted (below is order of
  precedence). When promoted, previous personal flags may be furled and cased and the flag
  of the new rank uncased and unfurled. Current and retired officer's personal colors will only
  be furled and cased at the individual‗s interment.
 36                                                            AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013


Figure 2.31. General Officer Flags (Personal Colors).




   2.27.2. Retired general officers of the Air Force may display their individual flags privately
   in their homes. Public display of individual flags for retired general officers is prohibited
   except when the officer is in uniform and being honored at an official military ceremony, the
   officer is in attendance on the reviewing stand in an official ceremony, or the officer is
   serving in an official capacity (such as guest speaker or presiding officer), and another flag
   depicting his or her rank is not already displayed. For retired general officers formerly
   authorized a positional flag (such as a former Chief of Staff of the Air Force), the 4-star flag
   would be displayed during ceremonies.
      2.27.2.1. It is not the custom or tradition in the Air Force to fly Personal Colors or
      Positional Colors out in front of the Headquarter Building of General Officers, as it is in
      other services. The only place you may find this is at Joint Headquarters where the Air
      Force may follow the custom and tradition of that Joint Command.
   2.27.3. Senior Executive Service (SES). This flag (Figure 2.32) is 3 feet by 4 feet and
   consists of an ultramarine blue field bearing the SES emblem in the center with the Air Force
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                     37


   crest encircled with stars (eagle, wreath and cloud form) placed above the emblem. The SES
   flag is trimmed on three sides with a 2½ inch yellow fringe. This flag can be used at
   ceremonies when a member of the SES is present and has an active role in the ceremony. It
   is never appropriate to case a SES member‗s individual flag. SES flags maybe purchased by
   the individual on his/her retirement if they wish to keep their flag.

Figure 2.32. United States Air Force Senior Executive Service Flag.




2.28. Guidons. Guidons (Figure 2.33) are ultramarine blue nylon or wool bunting, swallow-
tailed, 1 foot 8 inches by 2 feet 3¾ inches to end of swallow tail, and forked 10 inches. The Air
Force yellow American bald eagle design appears on both sides of the guidon, appearing on the
reverse as if printed through. Above the design is the designation of the parent unit and below it
the designation of the squadron. When the number of the squadron and the parent unit are the
same, the lower line indicates only the alphabetical portion of the squadron designation (for
example: top line 4 MSG, bottom line MSS). Numerals and lettering are yellow and are 3½
inches in height, with varying widths. Authorized abbreviations may be used. Lettering and
numerals appear on both sides of the guidon and read from left to right on both sides. Guidons
are used by squadrons on all ceremonial occasions. The USAF Honor Guard is authorized a
special ceremonial guidon.

Figure 2.33. Guidons.




   2.28.1. Groups, because they are an Air Force establishment, are authorized to display and
   use an organizational flag. However, groups are also authorized to display and use a guidon
   instead of an organizational flag. The local installation commander has approval authority to
   determine if groups will display and use an organizational flag or guidon.
2.29. Streamers. Streamers (Figure 2.34) are carried on flags approved for use and display on
Air Force installations. A complete set of campaign streamers is displayed on the United States
 38                                                           AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013


Air Force Departmental Ceremonial Flag. This complete set represents all campaigns that Air
Force units participated in as a unit. Authorized unit decoration streamers and campaign
streamers are carried on organizational flags and guidons on ceremonial occasions. Streamers
are a component part of the ceremonial flag and may be displayed at the discretion of the
responsible official of the organization having a ceremonial flag. Attachment 5 provides a
listing of streamers for the ceremonial flag. Attachments 5 and 6 provide information for
ordering streamers.

Figure 2.34. Streamers.




   2.29.1. Unit Organizational Flag. Streamers denote the unit's service, battle honors, or
   decorations. All streamers are swallow-tailed ribbons of the same design as the service
   ribbon for the theater, area of operations, or unit decorations. Campaign streamers and
   streamers for the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation and the Philippine Presidential
   Unit Citation are 2 3/4 inches in width and from 3 to 4 feet in length. The Presidential Unit
   Citation streamer is available in two sizes: 1 3/8 inches by 2 feet for display on guidons, and
   2 inches by 3 feet for display on organizational flags. The Air Force Outstanding Unit Award
   streamer is available only in the smaller size. Embroidery, when authorized (see AFI 36-

   Air Force standard. Upon replacing or purchasing new finials through attrition, the eagle,
   spearhead, acorn, or ball should not be purchased. All finials in a display or ceremony should
   be the same. This does not restrict the display of a state flag from a staff bearing a state
   device when national and other state flags are displayed from adjacent flagstaffs; however,

   patent) or dark blue slings are authorized.
   2.35.5. Bases. A weighted, silver colored base is the preferred base for use by the Air Force.
   Upon replacing or purchasing new bases through attrition, the silver colored base should be
   purchased.
2.36. Procurement and Disposition of Flags and Accoutrements. The following guidelines
apply:
   2.36.1. Procedures for Requisitions. Procedures for requisitioning organizational flags,
   guidons and streamers by activities are outlined in AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual,

     length is for use with organizational flags, and the four-foot length is used with the
     ceremonial flag. In Attachment 5, the campaign streamers that are identified with an
     asterisk require the four-foot length to accommodate the required embroidery regardless
     of which flag it is displayed on. Separate requisitions are necessary for each streamer
     requiring different embroidery. If a streamer is desired without embroidery, ―no
     embroidery required‖ should be annotated in the description section of the requisition.
  2.36.4. Issuing Flags and Flagstaffs to General Officers. The Air Force General Officer
  Management Office notifies the Air Force Clothing and Textile Office (AFCTO/MMIC),
  2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia PA 19101, of all general officer promotions.

       for and retained by the Air Force when a member of the Senior Executive Service
       separates or retires. However, supervisors may present the SES flag to a
       separating/retiring member after notifying Air Force Senior Executive Management
       Office of their intent to present the member‗s flag. Additional flags may be purchased by
       calling that office for further details.
2.37. Disposition of Flags and Related Items. The following guidance applies:
   2.37.1. Personal colors flags, with appropriate accessories, furnished to general officers may
   be retained by such officers on release from active duty. Other flags in their possession,

                                           FUNDING

3.1. Introduction. There are several sources of funds for protocol-related expenses. Always
refer to financial management policy when determining proper fund source. When in doubt,
consult with your staff judge advocate and financial manager. Remember to obtain required
approval before obligating funds. Detailed information about Protocol funding can be found in
AFPAM 34-1202, Chapter 3.
3.2. Appropriated Funds.
   3.2.1. Official Representation Funds (ORF). ORF are appropriated funds often referred to
   as contingency funds.         DoDD 7250.13, Use of Appropriated Funds for Official
   Representation Purposes, outlines official DoD policy concerning ORF and lists DoD
   officials eligible for official courtesies during official visits to the field (includes all Air
   Force installations, but not the Pentagon and other staff offices in the National Capital
   Region).
       3.2.1.1. HAF MD 1-6, The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force,
       delineates policy for the Secretariat and the Air Force on contingency funds and assigns
       responsibility for overall management of contingency funds to the Administrative
       Assistant to the SecAF. There are strict limits on the amounts allocated and the purposes
       for which they may be used. Exceptions to policy are possible, but require approval from
       the Office of the SecAF. Advance approval (preferably 10-15 days prior to the event) by
       the appropriate authority is required for all ORF requests.
       3.2.1.2. AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds, implements AFPD 65-6, Budget,
       and governs use of ORF. It incorporates and delineates policy established by DoD and
       the Secretariat.
   3.2.2. Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Funds. O&M Funds, which are also
   appropriated funds, may be used for many protocol-related expenses. However, to ensure
   expenditure of O & M funds is authorized, coordinate with your resource advisor before
   obligating O&M funds.
3.3. Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs) for Special Morale and Welfare (SM&W)
Purposes. AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs), Chapter 12, defines Air Force
policy concerning the request, approval, and use of NAFs for SM&W purposes.
3.4. When Government Funds Are Not Authorized or Available. For many requirements,
such as dinners and refreshments at a conference, the proper source of funds is the individual. In
these instances, funds are collected through hospitality fees or pro-rata costs. Private
organizations may help fund requirements as well but this support cannot be solicited. Consult
with both your finance and staff judge advocate offices to determine the proper way to proceed.
Additional information is available in AFPAM 34-1202.
3.5. Appropriated Funds (APFs) for Postage. APFs may be used to pay the postage for
official mail relating solely to the business of the United States Government. Guidance is
included in DoD 4525.8-M_AFMAN 33-306, DoD Official Mail Manual, C1.3 and C1.3.10.
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                    49

                                         MEMENTOS

4.1. Introduction. Presentation of mementos to official visitors and guests is a demonstration
of appreciation and in accordance with official courtesies. Refer to the Joint Ethics Regulation,
DoD 5500.7-R, AFI 34-201, AFI 65-601V1 and AFI 65-603 for policy. Additional guidance can
be found in AFPAM 34-1202, Chapter 4.
4.2. Stewardship. Mementos should be minor tokens of reminder, and need not be large or
expensive. If government funds are to be expended, determine what, if any, category of funds is
authorized and what amount may be spent. Refer to AFI 65-603 and DoDI 7250.13 for specifics
on mementos funded by ORF and AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFS) for
mementos purchased with SM&W.
4.3. Inventories. Separate inventories and accounts must be kept for mementos purchased with
APFs and NAFs.
4.4. Honoraria. Paying fees for guest speakers, lecturers and panelists, when they are
authorized, are always paid using APFs. As with mementos, policy exists to limit excessive fees
paid to these individuals. Refer to AFI 65-601V1 for specifics. Consult the local finance office
and staff judge advocate on appropriate procedures and limitations.
4.5. Accepting Gifts. You may encounter situations where mementos or gifts may be offered to
your commander, host, or even to you as a protocol official. Generally, gifts offered due to a
person‘s official position cannot be accepted. Consult your local staff judge advocate in these
situations to avoid possible legal repercussions for you or your commander. The Joint Ethics
Regulation (JER), DoD Directive 5500.7, Standards of Conduct, contains specific guidelines that
must be followed concerning gifts, gratuities, and honoraria from outside sources. AFI 51-601,
Gifts to the Department of the Air Force, outlines restrictions governing who within the Air
Force may accept or reject gifts offered to the Department of the Air Force.

                                           Chapter 5

                                    TRANSPORTATION

5.1. Introduction. The two applicable sources of Air Force policy regarding transportation are
AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement, and AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations. Attachment 8, General
Official Use Rules, and Attachment 9, GMV Official Use Rules for Transportation Terminals, of
AFI 24-301 provide tables with specific examples of instances in which transportation requests
are authorized as well as instances in which requests are not authorized. Detailed guidance can
be found in AFPAM 34-1202, Chapter 5.
5.2. Military Airlift. Military airlift (Mil Air) is one mode of DV transportation. Each Air
Force command has a validator that processes Mil Air requests. Requests for military
transportation are submitted via DD Form 2768, Military Air Passenger/Cargo Request.
5.3. Spouse and Dependent Travel. This includes spouse travel on military aircraft as well as
in staff cars or other military vehicles. The sources for Air Force policy are AFI 24-101 and AFI
24-301. Please refer to these documents for complete details. Both commercial and Military
Airlift authorization/approval must be supported with Invitational Travel Orders (ITOs). ITOs
ordinarily authorize reimbursement of transportation costs only.
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                       51


                                            Chapter 6

          TITLES, FORMS OF ADDRESS AND MILITARY ABBREVIATIONS

6.1. Forms of Address. Good manners and common courtesy dictate the use of correct forms
of address and titles in both conversation and correspondence. There are many resources
available that cover titles and various forms of address for all levels of the United States and
international governments.
   6.1.1. Address officials, i.e., Presidents, Ambassadors, and Cabinet members by their titles,
   never by name alone, e.g., ―Good Afternoon Mr. President‖, or ―Good Evening President
   Jones‖, not ―Good Evening Mr. Jones‖.
   6.1.2. Spouses of high-ranking officials, to include the Vice President and Cabinet members,
   do not share their spouse‗s official titles; therefore address them as Mr. or Mrs. or Ms. along
   with their surname, i.e., ―It is a pleasure to have you join us tonight Mrs. Jones.‖ Care must
   be taken to ensure that the spouse uses the same surname as the principal. A phone call or
   check ahead of time to determine their preference will save embarrassment.
   6.1.3. Refer to all presidential appointees once confirmed by Congress as well as Federal and
   State elected officials as ―The Honorable‖ when performing introductions. For example,
   introducing a speaker, ―The Honorable Suzanne Smith‖ is correct. However, when speaking
   directly to them, one would not say, ―good morning Honorable Smith,‖ but rather ―good
   morning Mrs. (or appropriate honorific) Smith.‖ The following is a partial list of American
   officials using "The Honorable".
       6.1.3.1. Executive Branch.
           6.1.3.1.1. Members of the Cabinet.
           6.1.3.1.2. Deputy Secretaries of the executive departments.
           6.1.3.1.3. Under Secretaries of the executive departments (officers of comparable
           rank).
           6.1.3.1.4. Special Assistants to the President.
           6.1.3.1.5. Deputy Under Secretaries of executive departments.
           6.1.3.1.6. Assistant Secretaries, Legal Advisor/Counselor (officers of comparable
           rank).
           6.1.3.1.7. American Ambassadors.
       6.1.3.2. Judiciary Branch (Current Justices of the Supreme Court are called "Justice").
           6.1.3.2.1. Judges of other courts.
           6.1.3.2.2. Presiding Justice of a court.
       6.1.3.3. Legislative Branch.
           6.1.3.3.1. Senate.
              6.1.3.3.1.1. The President of the Senate (V.P. of the U.S.).
52                                                             AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013


             6.1.3.3.1.2. President Pro Tempore of the Senate.
             6.1.3.3.1.3. Senators.
             6.1.3.3.1.4. Sergeant-at-Arms.
         6.1.3.3.2. House of Representatives.
             6.1.3.3.2.1. The Speaker.
             6.1.3.3.2.2. Representatives.
             6.1.3.3.2.3. Sergeant-at-Arms.
     6.1.3.4. State and Local Governments.
         6.1.3.4.1. Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Acting Governor of a state.
         6.1.3.4.2. Secretary of State.
         6.1.3.4.3. Chief Justice of State Supreme Court.
         6.1.3.4.4. State Attorney General (except PA--not an elected position).
         6.1.3.4.5. Treasurer, Comptroller or Auditor of a state (only treasurer in PA.).
         6.1.3.4.6. President of the Senate of a state.
         6.1.3.4.7. State Senator.
         6.1.3.4.8. Speaker of the House/Assembly/House of Delegates of a state.
         6.1.3.4.9. State Representative/ Assemblyman/Delegate.
         6.1.3.4.10. Mayor (elected).
  6.1.4. Although the courtesy title ―His/Her Excellency‖ is frequently accorded to foreign
  officials in very high positions, it is rarely used in addressing officials in the United States.
  However, some states accord this honor to their Governor. It is appropriate to call the
  Governor‗s office and request clarification to determine if this title should be used.
  6.1.5. There are two forms of academic titles, the doctorate and the position. If the person
  holding the doctorate is also a professor, either "Dr." or "Professor" is correct. This also
  holds true for those holding a title such as "Chancellor," "President," etc. If the title-holder
  does not also have a doctorate, address him or her by title.
  6.1.6. Foreign Title-Holders. A few common examples are: "Your Excellency" when
  addressing a foreign ambassador, a foreign chief of state, a president of a foreign republic,
  the head of government, a foreign cabinet officer, or other foreign official. "Your Highness"
  is used to address foreign royalty other than a king or queen (such as a baron, earl or
  princess, etc.). "Your Majesty" denotes a king or queen.
  6.1.7. Military Chaplains. Always address military chaplains as "Chaplain".               When
  addressing her/ him in writing, it should read, "Chaplain, Colonel Jill Smith".
  6.1.8. Military Doctors/Dentists. Doctors and dentists can be addressed as either "Doctor" or
  by their rank. Always use their rank when writing.
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                      53


   6.1.9. Military Lawyers. Lawyers are entitled to the use of "esquire" following their last
   name, but for military lawyers this is never done. Only their rank is used. It is acceptable for
   a military lawyer to use this designation without their rank when they are communicating
   with civilians in an unofficial capacity. For military purposes, always use rank.
   6.1.10. AFPAM 34-1202, provides guidance for addressing envelopes.
6.2. Military Rank Abbreviations. The military is rich in customs, courtesies and Service-
specific traditions. One specific tradition is the use of Service-unique abbreviations for rank,
which when used in written correspondence, indicates which branch of Military Service an
individual is from. In written correspondence, at every level, only the correct Service-unique
abbreviations are acceptable. However, today‗s automated environment often masks this
military tradition. Attachment 9 and Attachment 10 provide appropriate military abbreviations
for the Services.
   6.2.1. When a woman holds rank or title, always use it. This rule is no different from that
   used for men. The problem for many people occurs in addressing correspondence when the
   woman is married. The following should help you out in that situation:
       6.2.1.1. When the woman is military and the man is not, her name comes before his. The
       same is true when she holds a title and he does not. Ex: "Lt Col Jane Smith and Mr. John
       Smith;" "Lt Col Jane and John Smith" is also correct.
       6.2.1.2. When they are both in the military or hold titles, the ranking person's name
       comes first, unless the invitation is especially for the lower-ranking member (an awards
       ceremony honoring them, for instance) and their spouse as their guest. Ex: "Capt Susan
       Doe and Lt Mark Doe;" "Capt Susan and Lt Mark Doe" is also correct.
       6.2.1.3. When both spouses are of equal rank, the man's name comes first, unless the
       invitation is particularly for the woman, with her husband as her guest/escort. Ex:
       "Colonel Bill Jones and Colonel Mary Jones" or "Colonels Bill and Mary Jones."
6.3. Foreign Military. Members of a foreign military are accorded the same honors and respect
we render to our own. A few foreign militaries use the same rank names we use, often with
different symbols for these on their uniforms. Most foreign militaries have different names and
symbols for their rank. When you are in contact with a foreign member's liaison office (or
equivalent), use this as an appropriate time to find out the rank and correct form of address. If
you get confused or forget what to call a foreign military member, a polite "Sir" or "Ma'am"
should suffice.

                                           Chapter 7

                                        PRECEDENCE

7.1. Introduction. Precedence is the right to higher honor or priority of importance at a
ceremonial or formal occasion. Order of precedence mistakes may create a negative Service
image. Precedence must be validated before execution of any ceremony, honors or event.
Determining order of precedence is the starting point of all aspects of an official function, from
organizing the order of the arrival and departure, to seating, to introductions of distinguished
guests.
7.2. Determining Precedence.
   7.2.1. The President of the United States determines precedence for U.S. officials. The
   President may change the order of precedence within the government. An example of this
   occurred when President Kennedy elevated the Speaker of the House of Representatives to a
   position ahead of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
   7.2.2. The U.S. Department of State determines precedence among foreign representatives.
   Due to the dynamic nature of administrations and world politics, the State Department Office
   of Protocol maintains a precedence list, but does not make it available to the public.
   7.2.3. The Secretary of Defense determines precedence for Department of Defense (DoD)
   officials. Periodically, the Director, Administration and Management (OSD(A&M)), issues a
   revision memorandum to the DoD Order of Precedence.
7.3. Precedence Lists.
   7.3.1. There is no single official precedence list used by all agencies and departments of the
   Federal Government. Moreover, there is no definitive all-encompassing guide for
   determining precedence in any situation. The decision to rank one person ahead of another
   absent guidance is based on the purpose of the occasion and the best interests of the Air
   Force and the United States.
   7.3.2. The Air Force Protocol Office compiles and maintains the Air Force Precedence List
   based primarily on the Department of Defense Order of Precedence memorandum; the
   ―Flight Plan VIP Codes‖ published in the DoD Flight Information Publication ―GENERAL
   PLANNING;‖ Protocol - The Complete Handbook of Diplomatic, Official and Social Usage
   (25th Anniversary Edition by McCaffree, Innis, and Sand; Service Etiquette by Oretha D.
   Swartz; and United States Protocol: The Guide to Official Diplomatic Etiquette by
   Ambassador Mary Mel French. The Air Force precedence list is intended for use in
   determining priority for military airlift based on job responsibilities and may be used as a
   protocol guide for seating at official functions. It is not intended to supplant long-standing
   service etiquette associated with the customs and courtesies extended and received between
   individuals of different ranks.
7.4. Military Precedence.
   7.4.1. When position held is not a factor, precedence among officers on active duty is
   determined first by rank. When ranks are the same, precedence is determined by date of
   rank. When dates of rank are the same, precedence is determined by total active federal
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                         55


   military service date. When date of rank and total active federal military service date are the
   same, officers of the Regular Air Force take precedence among themselves according to their
   position on the permanent promotion list. They are followed by Guard officers on extended
   active duty who will precede Reserve officers on extended active duty. Guard and Reserve
   officers not on extended active duty follow.
   7.4.2. Refer to the USAF General Officers Relative Rank List (maintained by the Air Force
   General Officer Management Office) to determine relative rank among general officers in the
   Air Force (AF Portal link: https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/site/HAF/AF_A1/DPG).
   The other military services maintain the same type of relative rank list, but they are not made
   available to the public. To obtain the precedence order or date of rank for flag or general
   officers of other military services, contact the principal party‘s office or their protocol office.
      7.4.2.1. Distinguished Visitor (DV) codes are assigned to General Officers and Senior
      Executive Service (SES) civilians. DV codes are used to determine precedence for
      official visits, assignment of quarters and government transportation travel status. These
      codes can be found on the GO/SES rosters maintained by the Air Force Senior Executive
      Management Office. (Air Force Portal link: https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
      af/USAF/site/HAF/AF_A1/DPS)
   7.4.3. Retired officers rank with, but after, active duty officers of the same rank. Precedence
   for retired officers of the same rank is determined by date of rank. Retired general officers
   with positional precedence (e.g. former Chief of Staff or former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of
   Staff) are placed ahead of other retired officers of the same rank and by date of rank among
   others with similar positional precedence (e.g. two former Chiefs of Staff).
   7.4.4. Frocking of an officer to a higher grade entitles the individual to all honors, courtesies
   and benefits of the higher grade with the exception of pay and allowances. The officer is
   seated and given precedence ahead of others in the actual pay grade but behind all
   individuals actually holding the rank to which frocked. When more than one person frocked
   to the same rank is present, the effective date of frocking dictates precedence order. The rank
   currently worn determines the honors, courtesies and benefits accorded to the individual.
   7.4.5. Individuals on approved promotion lists continue to wear the insignia of the rank of
   the current pay grade and are accorded precedence in the current grade based on date of rank
   in that grade. The rank currently worn determines the honors, courtesies and benefits
   accorded to the individual. The use of the term select with the next higher grade is not
   appropriate.
7.5. Position Precedence.
   7.5.1. There are times when position takes precedence over date of rank. The Chairman of
   the Joint Chiefs of Staff is senior to all other officers, followed by the Vice Chairman Joint
   Chiefs of Staff, then the Service Chiefs (who are ranked by their dates of appointment, with
   the Coast Guard always last). At joint functions, Combatant Commanders, ranked by date of
   appointment, are placed ahead of other general officers. They are followed by active duty
   four-stars (by date of rank), retired four-stars, active duty three-stars, retired three-stars, and
   so on.
   7.5.2. Based on their positions, the commander and vice commander of a wing normally take
   precedence over other colonels in the wing, regardless of their date of rank. Similarly, at
 56                                                             AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013


   MAJCOMs, the directors and chiefs of special staff take precedence over other staff officers
   of similar grade regardless of their date of rank. In addition, individual unit commanders
   may use their discretion to determine that certain other positions in the unit should take
   precedence at unit events, such as a host or guest of honor. This is determined on an
   individual, case-by-case basis.
   7.5.3. The Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force (CMSAF).
      7.5.3.1. The person serving as the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force (CMSAF) is
      accorded special precedence status. In accordance with the Department of Defense
      (DoD) Order of Precedence (OSD Memo, dtd 19 Feb 2010) this position is coded DV
      Code 4 and afforded 3-star precedence. At Joint events, the CMSAF comes before ALL
      3-star generals. At Air Force exclusive events only, the CMSAF has precedence over all
      3-star generals except the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CVA).
      7.5.3.2. This precedence applies only to the currently serving Chief Master Sergeant of
      the Air Force. Retired Chief Master Sergeants of the Air Force should be placed in front
      of other retired chief master sergeants.
7.6. Department of Defense Civilians Order of Precedence.
   7.6.1. Senior Executive Service (SES) precedence is determined by DV codes or Priority
   Precedence codes and is based on the responsibility of the position not the pay grade held by
   a particular individual. Precedence among SES members accorded the same DV Code is
   determined by date of appointment to the Senior Executive Service. The Air Force Senior
   Executive Management Office maintains a duty roster with DV codes for senior civilians.
   Refer to their website for current information.
   7.6.2. Civilian positions above DV Code 4 are Executive Level positions and encompass the
   Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF), Under Secretary of the Air Force (USecAF), and
   Assistant Secretaries and the General Counsel. These positions are by presidential
   appointment with Senate confirmation.
7.7. Order of Precedence Among Elected Officials.
   7.7.1. Members of the U.S. Senate and Congress are ranked by length of continuous service.
   If this period is equal, then they are ranked by order in which their state was admitted to the
   Union or alphabetically by state.
   7.7.2. Other state and local officials can be difficult to rank. It is important to consider the
   purpose of the function, level of all guests, and political significance when determining
   seating arrangements or other tasks based on an order of precedence. Refer to the Air Force
   precedence list for additional guidance. When there is no definitive published guidance, it is
   vital that you keep the best interests of the Air Force and the United States in the forefront of
   planning and are consistent.
7.8. Diplomatic Precedence.
   7.8.1. Precedence for Chiefs of Missions is based upon when their credentials were
   presented to the Secretary of the Department of State. Chiefs of Missions are defined as, but
   not limited to, Papal nuncios, Ambassadors Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, Ministers
   Plenipotentiary, and Charges d‗Affaires.
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                    57


7.9. Other Rules to Consider.
   7.9.1. At a function in the U.S. to which the President has been invited but sends a
   representative, his representative is accorded the rank and courtesy that goes with the
   presidency. This is not true for other officials of the government. Their representatives are
   accorded precedence based on the position they hold.
   7.9.2. Spouses of government officials are accorded the same rank as the principals at
   official functions. They are seated accordingly unless they hold official positions
   themselves. In a case where the principal and the spouse both hold official positions, they
   are then placed in the order dictated by their official position.
   7.9.3. Widows of former presidents have a special place in the order of precedence. A
   widow is ranked according to the seniority of the term of office held by her husband.
   7.9.4. The Air Force provides widows of former Chiefs of Staff of the Air Force a special
   place in the order of precedence as well. CSAF widows are ranked according to the seniority
   of the term of office held by the CSAF.
   7.9.5. Medal of Honor recipients do not have a precedence code except when being
   specifically honored at a dinner, ceremony, or event where the medal recipient is the guest of
   honor, or based on the their military rank.

                              CUSTOMS AND COURTESIES

8.1. Hand Salutes.
   8.1.1. The hand salute is the form of greeting and recognition exchanged between persons in
   the armed services. All Air Force personnel in uniform are required to salute when they
   encounter any person or situation entitled to the salute.
      8.1.1.1. When the salute is rendered to another person, the junior member initiates the
      salute accompanied with an appropriate verbal greeting, e.g., ―Good Morning,
      Sir/Ma‗am.‖ The salute and a verbal greeting should be extended at a distance at which
      recognition is easy and audible. The salute should be offered early enough to allow the
      senior time to return it and extend a verbal greeting before passing. All salutes received
      when in uniform shall be returned; at other times, salutes received shall be appropriately
      acknowledged.
      8.1.1.2. When the salute is rendered to a senior officer in a vehicle, hold the salute until
      it is returned by the officer or after the vehicle has passed.
      8.1.1.3. When reporting to a senior officer, secure permission to enter, walk to within
      two paces of the officer or desk, halt, salute and report. Hold the salute until it is
      returned. Prior to departing, take one step back, render salute, execute an about face and
      leave in a military manner.
   8.1.2. Local commanders are obligated to review saluting policies for their installations. In
   areas where saluting would be highly repetitious or otherwise infeasible, commanders may
   designate the specific area(s) as a no salute or no hat, no salute area.
   8.1.3. A member not in formation but in uniform salutes as follows:
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                     59

Note: Rendering a salute is not required when arms are encumbered. However, one should
always extend a verbal greeting or respond to one in such a circumstance. (Note: You should
always salute a senior officer if he/she is encumbered and you are not, even though the salute
cannot be returned.)
   8.1.4. Groups and Formations.
       8.1.4.1. In formation, members do not render or return a salute unless given the
       command to do so. The person in charge salutes and acknowledges salutes for the whole
       formation.
       8.1.4.2. In groups, but not in formation. When a senior officer approaches, the first
       individual noticing the officer calls the group to attention. All members face the officer
       and salute (when outdoors). If the officer addresses an individual or the group, all remain
       at attention (unless otherwise ordered) until the end of the conversation, at which time
       they all salute the officer (when outdoors).
       8.1.4.3. In a work detail, workers do not salute. The person in charge salutes for the
       entire detail.
60                                                            AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013


  8.1.5. Persons guarding prisoners will not salute.
  8.1.6. Saluting the Flag.
     8.1.6.1. When not in formation, e.g., attendance at a parade, a salute is rendered to the
     flag as a sign of respect. This is done as the flag passes in review. Members of the
     Armed forces and veterans, who are present but not in uniform, may render the military
     salute. Members should stand at attention, salute six paces before the flag is even with
     them and hold the salute until the flag has passed six paces. All others stand at attention
     and place the right hand (with a hat if wearing one) over the heart.
     8.1.6.2. Flags on stationary flag staffs are only saluted during Reveille, Retreat, special
     ceremonies, or when the flag is being raised or lowered. In these cases, when outside and
     in uniform, face the flag (if visible) or face the direction the music is played and stand at
     attention and salute on the first note of ―To The Color‖ or the national anthem (or if
     neither is played, when you see the flag first being raised or lowered). Drop your salute
     after the last note of ―To The Color‖ or the national anthem is played, or when the flag
     has been fully raised or lowered, depending on the ceremony (During the playing of
     ―Sound Retreat‖ which precedes the lowering of the flag, stand at Parade Rest). If in a
     vehicle, during Reveille or Retreat pull the car to the side of the road and stop. All
     occupants sit quietly at attention until the last note of ―To The Color‖ or the national
     anthem is played (or the flag is fully raised or lowered). All sporting or physical training
     activities will stop during Reveille and Retreat (if the flag is being raised or lowered)
     with proper honors shown to the flag. Members of the Armed Forces and veterans who
     are present, but not in uniform, may render the military salute when outdoors. This is
     true for hoisting, lowering or passing of the Unites States Flag and the national anthem.
     All other individuals will stand at attention and place their right hand (with a hat if
     wearing one) over their heart. If the base flies the U.S. flag continuously for 24-hours
     with only Reveille or Retreat played, but no action with the flag, individuals are not
     required to stop and salute. Reveille and Retreat on their own are bugle calls only. The
     playing of ―To The Color,‖ the national anthem or the raising or lowering of the flag is
     what requires proper honors to be displayed to the flag.
     8.1.6.3. The ceremonial occasions when the salute is rendered, outdoors only, include the
     passing of the uncased Colors, the playing of honors music, the national anthem of any
     nation, or ―To The Color‖.
     8.1.6.4. When indoors and in uniform, face the flag (or the music if the flag is not
     visible) and stand at attention when the national anthem (of any country) or ―To The
     Color‖ is played (do not place your hand over your heart). There are two exceptions. If
     in uniform, under arms, salute. The other rule applies to spectators in uniform at a
     military ceremony inside where ‗outdoor‘ rules apply (i.e. a change of command
     ceremony planned for outdoors but moved inside a hanger due to inclement weather).
     When indoors and in civilian clothes, face the flag (or the music if the flag is not visible),
     stand at attention when the national anthem (of any country) or ―To The Color‖ is played
     and place the right hand over the heart.
     8.1.6.5. When at a military funeral in uniform, salute the caisson or hearse as it passes
     and the casket as it is carried by your position. A salute should also be rendered during
     the firing of volleys and the playing of Taps.
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                     61


8.2. Other Marks of Respect.
   8.2.1. Juniors shall show deference to seniors at all times by recognizing their presence and
   by employing a courteous and respectful bearing and mode of speech toward them.
   8.2.2. Juniors shall stand at attention (unless seated at mess or circumstances make such
   action impracticable or inappropriate) as follows:
       8.2.2.1. When addressed by a senior officer.
       8.2.2.2. When an officer of flag or general rank, the commanding officer, or an officer
       senior to the commanding officer, or an officer making an official inspection enters the
       room or space.
   8.2.3. Juniors shall walk or ride to the left of seniors whom they are accompanying.
   8.2.4. Officers shall enter aircraft and other modes of transportation in inverse order of rank
   and shall depart them in order of rank, unless there is special reason to the contrary. The
   seniors shall be accorded the more desirable seats.
8.3. Making a Proper Introduction. When introducing two individuals, mention the honored
or senior person first, e.g. General Smith, I would like to introduce to you, Captain John Jones;
Captain Jones, General Smith. Please note, proper etiquette suggests using, ―introduce to you,‖
and not ―introduce you to.‖ It is always appropriate to explain to the senior person where the
junior person is assigned.
8.4. Courtesies to the Air Force Song.
   8.4.1. When the Air Force Song is played, it is customary to stand, clap and join in singing
   as directed by the nature of the ceremony. Do not salute. The Official Party may move after
   the playing of the first verse of the Air Force Song. Proper respect and courtesy is always
   rendered to Service songs.

10.1. Invitations. There are different types of invitations for military functions, from a formal
engraved invitation to an informal phone call. Guidance is included in AFPAM 34-1202,
Chapter 10. Invitees to events often include local city, county, and state officials; chamber of
commerce officials and members of organizations that are supportive to the military, and/or
commanders/key people from other military organizations in the local area. Be aware that some
guest lists may have to meet specific ratios of DoD to non-DoD participants if using ORFs (see
AFPAM 34-1202 and AFI 65-603).
10.2. Additional Event Details. Protocol staff is responsible for many details beyond the
invitations: R.s.v.p. processes, nametags, table seating, place cards, etc. Refer to AFPAM 34-

                                        FLIGHT LINE

11.1. Security/Flight Line Access Requirements.
   11.1.1. Flight Line Access and Procedures. Access to most flight lines is restricted, and
   procedures vary from flight line to flight line. Most flight lines require a flight line
   certificate of competency and a line badge to gain access. Check with your local security
   forces and base operations for a complete list of rules and requirements. (Refer to AFI 13-
   213, Airfield Driving; AFI 13-202, Overdue Aircraft; and AFOSH STD 91-100, Aircraft
   Flight Line - Ground Operations and Activities.)
   11.1.2. Customs/Immigration. If a DV is arriving from out of country, check with base
   operations to see if there are any special requirements for processing passengers and
   offloading the aircraft.
   11.1.3. Local Policy. For detailed information, see the local guidelines maintained by the
   installation safety office.
11.2. Safety. Safety is the number one issue and must be considered above all else. Safety rules
should NEVER be compromised simply for expediency.
   11.2.1. Red Lines. On the flight line, identify secure areas and ensure they are never crossed
   except at appropriate entry control points (ECP) with proper clearance for the area.
   11.2.2. Foreign Object Damage (FOD). Debris can cause damage to aircraft if driven over
   or ingested into an engine. Every time a vehicle is driven onto the airfield surface, the driver
   must stop at a designated entry point and check all tires for foreign objects in the treads and
   under the wheel wells. Foreign objects must be removed and properly disposed of before
   proceeding. Furthermore, retrieve and properly dispose of FOD seen while on the flight line.
   11.2.3. Hats are not normally worn on the flight line; however, it is common for DV greeters
   and the greeting party to wear hats when greeting high-ranking personnel. All members of
   the official greeting party and all others assisting should follow suit.
   11.2.4. Ear Plugs must be available and worn when appropriate. Base operations will
   normally assist is supplying these for all participating members and passengers.
   11.2.5. Ramp Freeze. Airfield management may call a ramp freeze 15 minutes prior to
   arrival or departure of a four star general or higher. The freeze does not apply to vehicles
   that normally operate on the airfield. All vehicles not supporting the arrival/departure should
   be kept clear of the primary DV parking spot anytime aircraft and gathering personnel are
   present.
11.3. Communication. It is imperative to have a list of contact numbers on hand and means to
communicate. Quick reference contacts include but are not limited to: base operations,
command post, air transportation operations center (ATOC), transient alert (TA), passenger
terminal, security forces, transportation, aircrew and the customs/immigration representative, if
applicable.
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                        65


11.4. Manifest Passengers. Obtain a complete list of passengers for arrivals. Many times
initial reports will only list the senior DV. It is important to be prepared for the possibility of
multiple DVs disembarking an aircraft. Determine whether the DV will be disembarking the
aircraft and, if not, determine their destination. Base operations are generally the primary point
to get the needed information. They may not have the information themselves but can normally
initiate the steps to get it. Be proactive and, if necessary, notify the receiving base for transient
DVs.
11.5. Checklist. A local checklist for each specific flight line should be assembled based on
local policies, procedures and commander preferences. This is a quick reference to ensure
adequate preparation.
11.6. Equipment. Ensure any special equipment for special aircraft such as high lift or lighted
stairs, baggage conveyor or generators are readily available. Generally, TA or aircraft
maintenance will have these ready and in place, but it is important to confirm.
11.7. DV Lounge. Use common sense as to what the DV lounge will require depending on the
type of DV, how long they have traveled, and where they are arriving from or departing to.
Consideration should also be given to their itinerary while on the installation.
   11.7.1. Water and Refreshments. Ensure water is potable and palatable and, if possible,
   cold. Other refreshments such as coffee or snacks should be fresh and appropriate.
   11.7.2. Restrooms. Provide clean and serviceable restrooms.
   11.7.3. Communication.
       11.7.3.1. Phones. Local, long distance, and DSN should be available.
       11.7.3.2. A secure phone should be available, per local procedures. Provide a key if
       necessary.
       11.7.3.3. Office equipment. Computer connectivity (docking station, keyboard, mouse,
       and printer) are beneficial along with fax, copier, and printer.
       11.7.3.4. Amenities. The DV lounge should be comfortable, clean, and air-conditioned.
       Television, music, decorations, and flowers should be considered depending on the
       visitor, situation and local availability. Non-appropriated funds must not be used to stock
       the food/ drink amenities.
       11.7.3.5. Marquee or welcome boards. Ensure contents of welcome boards are
       appropriate, correct and up to date. Verify the customs of foreign visitors. If there is an
       elevated security risk, check with local security and OSI to ensure the marquee does not
       increase a DV‗s security risk.
11.8. Flight Status. Keep abreast of departure, arrival time and aircraft status. Command post,
base operations and ATOC provide assistance with this information. USTRANSCOM‘s Single
Mobility System (SMS) is also available to track the status of registered flights at the following
secure website: https:\\sms.transcom.mil. Keep the commander, DV greeter and anyone with a
need to know informed of any changes in arrival time. Be sure the greeting party will be able to
be on the flight line in plenty of time.
11.9. Aircraft Parking. Check with TA, aircraft maintenance or base operations as appropriate
to determine where the aircraft is or will be parked. Inspect the area to ensure arrival/departure
 66                                                               AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013


location is clean and safe. For an arriving aircraft, be sure there is not already an aircraft parked
in the assigned spot. For a departing aircraft, ensure the aircraft is in the appropriate parking
spot, it is the appropriate type of aircraft, the tail number matches the manifest and that it is not
obviously unserviceable. Contact base operations or TA if there are any discrepancies.
11.10. Vehicle Positioning. DV transportation should be parked in a designated area. If in
doubt, verify with base operations or TA. The first vehicle in line is that of the senior ranking
DV. If flight line access is permitted, the vehicle will drive up on the left side of the aircraft from
the rear, once TA has indicated it is safe to approach. Verify the direction the aircraft will be
parked and validate the location of the exit doors.
11.11. Public Affairs. Notify PA so they can be available and determine what, if any, type of
media is required.
11.12. Customs and Courtesies. When hosting DVs, plan and execute to reflect the
professionalism, customs, courtesies and traditions of the United States Air Force. Appropriate
honors and courtesies are to be extended with due deference to position, title, and rank
precedence. Requirements for saluting may differ from base to base depending on command and
operational activity. Members of a formal greeting party always salute the arrival and departure
of an aircraft carrying a DV for whom saluting is appropriate (see Chapter 8). Saluting is
normally required around the base operations building, the passenger terminal, and similar
locations. Saluting is not normally required in aircraft parking areas, areas designated for aircraft
maintenance, aircraft static displays, or an aircraft alert hangar area. Regardless of the location
on a flight line, if the situation appears appropriate for saluting, salute. It is an expected courtesy.
11.13. Red Carpet. If used, the red carpet (or red carpet painted on the pavement) is located at
the primary DV parking spot. Pavement markings should be placed in the transient DV parking
area to allow TA to position the aircraft appropriately and align the door with the red carpet.
11.14. Safety. Do not approach the aircraft until it has come to a complete stop, engines have
shut down, and door has opened; or until movement is directed by ATOC or TA personnel on
site.
11.15. Greeting Party. Identify members greeting the DVs early, review arrival/departure
customs and courtesies, be sure they are knowledgeable of the itinerary and have necessary
transportation. They should be familiar with the DV lounge and other readily available facilities.
Installation commanders establish local guidelines defining specific procedures in this area. The
greeting party should be briefed by the protocol officer on line-up positions. Greeters line up
right to left facing the door side of the aircraft. The senior ranking individual stands to the far
right as the plane pulls onto the flight line and into the parking spot. Spouses stand to the left of
their respective principal. At their discretion, the senior greeter commands, ―present arms‖ as
the aircraft approaches. Once the aircraft stops, the senior greeter commands ―order arms‖.
(Figure 11.1).
   11.15.1. If the DV is a civilian, no salute is required, unless it is the President or Vice
   President of the United States, Secretary of Defense or any of the Service Secretaries. Stand
   at attention until the aircraft comes to a stop.
   11.15.2. If there are civilians in the greeting party, they do not salute, but stand in a
   respectful manner with arms to their sides.
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                      67


   11.15.3. Once the engine has been cut off and the wheels are chocked, the senior ranking
   person takes the lead and the greeting party lines up at the aircraft‗s door.
   11.15.4. As members of the arriving party exit the aircraft, the senior officer and members of
   the arrival party step forward to greet the individual(s) and move them quickly to their
   vehicles.
   11.15.5. When customs/immigrations are required, they enter the aircraft before the
   passengers disembark.

Figure 11.1. Greeting Party Positioning.




11.16. Transportation.
   11.16.1. Placing Vehicles.
      11.16.1.1. Move vehicles into place only after aircraft engines are cut off and wheels are
      chocked.
      11.16.1.2. When driving across yellow lines, the driver side should be nearest to the
      aircraft. However, the passenger side of car should be closest during loading.
      11.16.1.3. A spotter is required when backing up to the aircraft.
      11.16.1.4. The vehicle transporting the senior ranking DV will be in the lead position.

       11.16.1.5. Security vehicles may be required, depending on threat level, otherwise they
       are optional. If included in the motorcade, they will become the lead and trailing vehicles.
       This will ensure timely movement and prohibit other vehicles from interfering with the
       motorcade. In addition, control points may be used to expedite traffic flow.
11.17. Seating. The seat of honor is on the rear passenger side. (See Figure 11.2) Consider
aide-de-camp and personal security officers when planning vehicle seating.

Figure 11.2. Vehicle Seating.




11.18. Luggage.
   11.18.1. Use a separate vehicle for luggage. Do not make the DV wait while luggage is
   being off-loaded. A detail may be required if there is a large amount of luggage.
   11.18.2. Provide a covered vehicle for inclement weather.
   11.18.3. Be prepared for possible security, customs, or agriculture inspections.
   11.18.4. Ensure luggage is properly and easily identifiable.
   11.18.5. Plan for delivery.
11.19. Aircraft Preparation. (See 11.9 Aircraft Parking) Check to ensure the aircraft is
serviced, ready, and the flight crew is standing by. Make sure stairs are available if needed.
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                            69


11.20. Weather. During times of uncertain weather, it is a good idea to have a contingency plan
in the event the aircraft is unable to depart. This may include lodging reservations or backup DV
transportation depending on the situation. If inclement weather, bring an umbrella.
11.21. Farewell Party. Rules are the same as greeting party, but in reverse, i.e. marquee
message, earplugs, etc. Generally, the baggage will arrive and load before the passengers. If
there are any space-available passengers who have been approved by the senior DV for travel,
they will be loaded prior to the arrival of the DV. The DV will generally be the last on the
aircraft and the first off the aircraft. If waved off by the DV, the farewell party may depart, but
the protocol officer should remain nearby until the aircraft departs.
11.22. Salute. The senior officer will give the command for the salute when the aircraft starts
rolling. Salute will be held until the aircraft makes its first turn for departure or the entire aircraft
passes the farewell party. If the DV returns the salute or flashes his window shutter, the senior
member of the farewell party may command, "order arms".
11.23. Flight Line Ceremony. If a flight line ceremony is required, keep the event as simple as
possible by minimizing the requirements. Depending on the event, honor guard and music may
be required. If playing musical honors, the official party should hold in place at the top of
cordon by the aircraft for playing of musical honors. Once musical honors are completed, the
official party should proceed as required. It is important to note that the official party should not
be moving during the playing of musical honors. See Attachment 2 for appropriate honors and
flags.

                                           Chapter 12

                             DISTINGUISHED VISITORS (DVS)

12.1. Definition of a Distinguished Visitor (DV). A DV is defined as (1) any general or flag
officer; (2) any government official with rank equivalent to a brigadier general or higher; or (3)
any foreign military officer or civilian designated a DV by the Under Secretary of the Air Force
for International Affairs (SAF/ IA). At times, persons of lower rank but appointed to or filling
certain positions, may be accorded DV status. The purpose of the visit will determine if the
distinction of DV should be accorded. The commander determines the DV distinction on an
individual basis.
12.2. Honors Accorded DVs. Honors are intended to extend a mark of courtesy, respect and
recognition to a distinguished person (honors will be accorded only to the distinguished person,
not to his/her personal representative). Honors are usually demonstrated using cannon salutes (if
in a joint environment), escort of honor or honor guard, parades or review of operations and
ruffles and flourishes. See Attachment 2 for a list persons entitled to honors, together with the
number of guns, ruffles and flourishes, and the prescribed music for each.
   12.2.1. In general, honors and ceremonies are reserved for the President, Vice President,
   statutory appointees, and general or flag officers of the United States military establishment,
   international dignitaries, and for occasions when such ceremonies promote international
   goodwill.
   12.2.2. International civilian and military officials, occupying positions equivalent to those
   listed at Attachment 10, will be rendered equivalent honors to which the United States
   official is entitled, regardless of actual military rank. All other foreign military persons will
   receive the honors due their actual rank or its United States Air Force equivalent.
12.3. Minimizing Frequency of Ceremonial Honors.
   12.3.1. Formal welcoming ceremonies, when planned by appropriate authority for specific
   purposes, are always appropriate when they are instrumental in improving morale or
   maintaining national prestige.
   12.3.2. In the interest of economy and manning, parades, honor cordons, motorcades, and
   other ceremonial aspects, which involve large number of personnel and equipment, will be
   held to an absolute minimum when officials entitled to such honors visit military
   installations. In general, full honors will be reserved for statutory appointees and general or
   flag officers of the military services, for foreign dignitaries, and for occasions when
   ceremonies promote international good will. It is the prerogative of the commander to
   determine types of honors to be rendered.
   12.3.3. Officials of the Department of the Air Force entitled to ceremonial honors will advise
   the appropriate commander of impending official visits. Notification will include adequate
   advance notice, the general purpose of the visit, and particular items or areas of interest to the
   visitor. Such officials will also notify the commander that ceremonies will be dispensed with
   unless for compelling reasons they support or enhance the purpose of the visit. All visitors
   are encouraged to decline routine honors unless the ceremony serves a useful purpose that
   benefits the nation, the Air Force, the installation or community good will. Officials of the
72                                                            AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013


  Department of Defense and other military departments are also expected to support this
  practice. Commanders who receive requests to omit honors or ceremonies will comply with
  such requests unless special local circumstances indicate that it is in the best interest of the
  Air Force or community relations to render honors. If this is the case, the commander will
  advise the visitor.
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                   73


                                          Chapter 13

                                      CONFERENCES

13.1. Overview. Protocol may be asked to manage or support conferences, workshops, and
seminars. These may range in complexity from a single half-day working session to a week-long
event, with several social functions. Normally protocol involvement will be focused on
supporting social events and ensuring certain logistical matters have been handled (lodging,
transportation, meals and socials, etc.). For large conferences, the commander should appoint an
OPR to lead the effort and make sure all arrangements are made.
13.2. References. See AFPAM 34-1202, Chapter 13, for descriptions of the activities and
arrangements common to most conferences.
 74                                                              AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013


                                            Chapter 14

                                  MILITARY CEREMONIES

14.1. Reference. Directive guidance about military ceremonies is included in this chapter.
Refer to AFPAM 34-1202, Chapter 14, for additional protocol guidance concerning custom and
procedure for military ceremonies including funerals, retirements, promotions, changes and
assumptions of command, activations, inactivations, re-designations, reenlistments, awards,
decorations, reveille, retreat, building rededications, ribbon cuttings and POW/MIA.
14.2. Officiating Official. The officiating official of a retirement, promotion, or award
ceremony should be the first appropriate individual in the honoree‘s chain of command, officer
or senior civilian. The officiating official should be higher in grade to the honoree. It is not
appropriate for enlisted members to officiate a ceremony. If the honoree desires someone other
than the first appropriate individual in the chain, the honoree should discuss this with his or her
supervisor. An SES or GS may officiate at all ceremonies with the exception of
enlistment/reenlistment and initial commission ceremonies for officers. These ceremonies
require an active, reserve, guard or retired officer to officiate. As an officiating official, an SES
or GS may administer the oath of office when it is purely ceremonial in nature. Ensure General
Officers or SESs with a participating role in the ceremony, which are neither the hosts nor just
guests (i.e. making remarks, presenting a medal, etc.), are included in the official party. Personal
or positional colors should be posted and musical honors played for the highest rank of the
person in the official party, even if not the host.
14.3. Military Funerals. The USAF Honor Guard or the Base Honor Guard under the
provisions of AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program, typically conducts military funerals.
Flyovers are conducted under the provisions of AFI 34-242. See AFPAM 34-1202, Chapter 14,
for details and guidance on military funerals.
14.4. Individual Retirements. AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements, provides details on service
retirements. Air Force Manual 36-2203, Drill and Ceremonies, provides further guidance on
outdoor retirements. If more than one individual is retiring in same ceremony, retirement order is
by rank, highest to lowest. However, if awards are being presented, retirements are conducted in
order of awards being presented IAW AFPAM 34-1202, paragraph 14.9.3, rule for ease of
ceremony movement.
14.5. Promotion Ceremony. Promotions are significant events in the lives of military people.
Commanders and supervisors are responsible for ensuring their people receive proper
recognition. Since promotion ceremonies are ceremonial in nature, SES/GS individuals may act
as presiding officer, to include administering the oath of office, except for initial commissioning
ceremonies. Enlisted members may not officiate a promotion ceremony. Officer promotion
ceremonies should include a reaffirmation of the oath of office (from AFI 36-2501, Officer
Promotions and Selective Continuation): ―I, (NAME), having been appointed a (grade in which
appointed), United States Air Force, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend
the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear
true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental
reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the
office upon which I am about to enter, so help me God.‖
AFI34-1201 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                     75


14.6. Appointment and Assumption of Command. Details and guidance are included in AFI
51-604, Appointment to and Assumption of Command, and AFPAM 34-1202.
14.7. Reenlistment Ceremony. Airman may invite any commissioned officer to perform the
ceremony. Reenlistees and reenlisting officers must wear an authorized uniform for the
ceremony. (Exception: The uniform requirement is optional for retired officers.) The core of the
ceremony is the oath of enlistment. The oath is recited by the officer and repeated by the re-
enlistee. The re-enlistee and the officer administering the oath must be physically collocated
during the ceremony. Once completed, the officer congratulates the re-enlistee and invites the
other attendees to do the same. The enlisted oath follows: ―I, (NAME), do solemnly swear (or
affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,
foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, and that I will obey
the orders of President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me,
according to regulations and the uniform code of military justice—so help me God.‖
14.8. Relinquishment of Command. There is no approved ceremony in the Air Force called a
―Relinquishment of Command‖, nor is there funding for such a ceremony. AFI 51-604 makes no
reference of relinquishment of command nor does AFMAN 36-2203, Drill and Ceremonies.
Therefore, a ceremony called or based on relinquishment of command (example ―Celebration of
Command‖) will not be executed by Air Force personnel.

                                    SOCIAL FUNCTIONS

15.1. Planning. Social functions require keen planning by project officer and protocol staffs.
Tradition guides plans for many social functions. Refer to AFPAM 34-1202, Chapter 15, for
guidance on planning, customs and procedures for social functions including seating, toasting,
receiving lines, formal dinners and other forms of entertainment.
15.2. Seating. Seating can be the key to the success of an event. Rank precedence forms the
basis for making most seat assignments. The position of honor is always to the right of the
hostess (or host at a stag event).
15.3. Receiving Lines. Individuals in the receiving line are stationed single file according to the
rules of precedence. The host (usually the commander) and his/her spouse are number one and
number two.

                             DININGS IN AND DININGS OUT

16.1. Purpose. The dining in and dining out represent the most formal aspects of Air Force
social life designed to bring a unit together in an atmosphere of camaraderie, good fellowship,
and social rapport. A dining in includes members of a wing, organization, or unit only. A
dining out includes spouses and guests. Please refer to AFPAM 34-1202, Chapter 16, for
guidance concerning customs and procedures.
16.2. Dress. For traditional dinings in and out, military attendees wear formal dress uniform in
accordance with AFI 36-2903. Civilian guests wear formal attire. For combat dinings in and
out, military attendees wear their combat dress (ABUs, flight suit). AFPAM 34-1202 provides
additional guidance on uniform wear for formal functions.

NOTES:

1. The same number of honor cordon members is provided on departure as on arrival.

2. The United States Navy Band arrangement of the national anthem and the United States Marine
Corps Band arrangement of ―Hail to the Chief‖ are the official DoD arrangements to be played by
all service bands on appropriate occasions.

3. The traditional musical selection, ―Hail to the Chief,‖ is designated as a musical tribute to the
President of the United States; as such, it will not be performed by military musical organizations
as a tribute to other dignitaries. Performances of this selection are subject to:

   a. During ―Hail to the Chief‖ by military musical organizations, military personnel in uniform
      (other than band personnel) will accord the same honor as for the national anthem or ―To
      The Color‖.
   b. If, in the course of any ceremony, honors must be performed more than once, ―Hail to the
      Chief‖ may be used interchangeably with the national anthem as honors to the President of
      the United States.
   c. When specified by the President, the Secretary of State, the Chief of the Secret Service, or
      an authorized representative, ―Hail to the Chief‖ may be used as an opportunity for the
      President and immediate party to move to or from their places while all others stand fast.
   d. During a State Funeral for a former President of the United States, ―Hail to the Chief‖ is
      authorized.

4. When Foreign national anthem(s) and the U.S. national anthem are performed, the U.S.
national anthem is performed last, except in conjunction with mourning colors.

5. Foreign civilian and military officials, occupying positions comparable to these U.S. officials
will receive equivalent honors. Foreign recipients of honors must be representatives of countries
recognized by the United States. Foreign civilian officers receive the last musical strain (32 bars)
of ―Hands Across the Sea.‖

 6. Appropriate background music is any music such as a national air or a folk song favorably
associated with the distinguished person or his country. If no such music is known or available,
any music of universal appeal and propriety may be used. All music performed as background
should be appropriately subdued to the principal action.

7. Appropriate inspection music may be in any meter and played so it would not require the
inspection party to conform to its cadence.

8. Commanders of Air Force installations may obtain recorded music on discs for use in
connection with honors and ceremonies by writing directly to the Audio Section, United States Air
Force Band, Bolling AFB, D.C. 20032. Music is also available for download at the U.S. Air Force
Recordings website: http://www.music.af.mil/.

9. For events honoring foreign dignitaries, the flags of the foreign country of the guest(s) being
honored should be included in the color guard when available.

Figure A4.2. Air Force Script for Flag Folding Ceremony
For more than 200 years, the American flag has been the symbol of our nation‘s unity, as well as
a source of pride and inspiration for millions of citizens.

Born on June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress determined that the flag of the United
States be thirteen stripes, alternating between seven red and six white; and that the union be
thirteen stars, white in a blue field representing a new constellation. (1)

Between 1777 and 1960, the shape and design of the flag evolved into the flag presented before
you today. The 13 horizontal stripes represent the original 13 colonies, while the stars represent
the 50 states of the Union. The colors of the flag are symbolic as well; red symbolizes hardiness
and valor; white signifies purity and innocence; and blue represents vigilance, perseverance and
justice. (1)

Traditionally, a symbol of liberty, the American flag has carried the message of freedom, and
inspired Americans, both at home and abroad.

In 1814, Francis Scott Key was so moved at seeing the Stars and Stripes waving after the British
shelling of Baltimore‘s Fort McHenry that he wrote the words to ―The Star Spangled Banner‖.
(2)

In 1892, the flag inspired Francis Bellamy to write the ―Pledge of Allegiance,‖ our most famous
flag salute and patriotic oath. (2)

In July 1969, the American flag was ―flown‖ in space when Neil Armstrong planted it on the
surface of the moon. (2)

Today, our flag flies on constellations of Air Force satellites that circle our globe, and on the fin
flash of our aircraft in harms way in every corner of the world. Indeed, it flies in the heart of
every Airman who serves our great Nation. The sun never sets on our U.S. Air Force, nor on the
flag we so proudly cherish. (2)

Since 1776, no generation of Americans has been spared the responsibility of defending
freedom. Today‘s Airmen remain committed to preserving the freedom that others won for us,
for generations to come.

By displaying the flag, and giving it a distinctive fold, we show respect to the flag and express
our gratitude to those individuals who fought, and continue to fight for freedom, at home and
abroad. Since the dawn of the 20th century, Airmen have proudly flown the flag in every major
conflict on lands and skies around the world. It is their responsibility and our responsibility to
continue to protect and preserve the rights, privileges and freedoms that we, as Americans, enjoy
today.

The United States flag represents who we are. It stands for the freedom we all share and the
pride and patriotism we feel for our country. We cherish its legacy, as a beacon of hope to one
and all. Long may it wave.
