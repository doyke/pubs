Section A—-Purpose and Objectives

1. Purpose of Community Relations. Commanders will run active community relations
programs to enhance morale, public trust, and support and to demonstrate that the Air Force is a
community partner and a responsible steward of National resources.
2. Objectives of the Community Relations Program.
     2.1. Increase public awareness and understanding of the armed forces and the mission,
     policies, and programs of the Air Force.
     2.2. Support Air Force recruiting by inspiring patriotism and encouraging young men and
     women to serve in the military.
     2.3. Maintain a reputation as a good neighbor as well as a respected, professional
     organization charged with part of the responsibility for national security.

Section B—-Program Approval and Participation

3. Approval for Programs. Except as noted in this instruction, Major Commands (MAJCOMs)
and the Air National Guard have the authority to approve the use of community relations
resources (speakers, bands, honor guard, etc). They may grant approval authority to subordinate
commanders. Proposals for community relations programs exceeding local support capability or
the scope of local Public Affairs responsibility must be referred through channels to the
MAJCOM or next level higher headquarters with a description of the anticipated scope of the
program, comments concerning expected civilian reaction, recommendations, and predicted
benefits.
     3.1. SAF/PA and/or OASD/PA approve:
        3.1.1. National Capital Region (NCR). All Air Force support of community relations
        programs in the NCR, except speaking engagements to non-foreign groups. The NCR
        includes the District of Columbia; Montgomery and Prince George’s counties in
        Maryland; Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William counties in Virginia; and the
        cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, and Falls Church in Virginia.
        3.1.2. National and international programs, including conventions and meetings, except
        those in overseas areas under combatant or specified commanders.
        3.1.3. Programs requiring liaison between DOD and Washington, D.C., offices of
        national non-government organizations and groups, except Air Force special interest
        groups such as the Air Force Association (AFA) and the Air Force Sergeants Association
        (AFSA).
AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010                                                                         5


     3.1.4. Programs providing information or other support to national organizations,
     including business and industry groups.
     3.1.5. Programs outside the United States not within a combatant command’s area of
     responsibility.
     3.1.6. OASD/PA will approve aerial reviews and requests involving more than one
     service.
     3.1.7. Sports. Preseason, post-season, or known programmed national sports and
     professional athletic events within the United States. SAF/PA approves with notification
     to OASD/PA as required.
     3.1.8. Events of professional, technical, or scientific interest to the Air Force when
     participation will result in additional cost to the government. The request must include
     an estimate of the expense.
     3.1.9. Programs or events requiring exceptions to DOD policy, which must be
     specifically justified.
  3.2. SAF/PA approves:
     3.2.1. National Civic Outreach Tour. A completed tour plan template to include
     justification must be forwarded to SAF/PA’s Engagement Division (SAF/PAY) for
     review before being planned or guests being invited. For additional information and
     guidance on preparing tour plans, contact SAF/PAY.
     3.2.2. Proper level of support for aircraft, related equipment, and support personnel
     requests for participation in all public events.
     3.2.3. Invitations from a foreign host in the Washington, D.C. area.
     3.2.4. Public Affairs airlift involving foreign nationals to CONUS, in conjunction with
     Secretary of the Air Force International Affairs Directorate (SAF/IA).
  3.3. Local unit commanders are authorized to participate routinely in local events jointly
  planned and conducted by border communities of the United States, Mexico, and Canada.
  Favorable consideration for participation should be based on the significance of the event and
  defense interest. Consultation and approval is required from U.S. consular officials in the
  Mexican and Canadian communities involved.
  3.4. Within the United States, MAJCOMs coordinate community relations programs and
  public events with combatant and specified commands significantly affected. DOD requires
  combatant and specified commands to coordinate with HQ USAF and MAJCOMs on
  programs requiring Air Force support.
  3.5. Per the Secretary of Defense, combatant commanders are responsible for approving and
  participating in overseas public events. This authority may be delegated. While Air Force
  MAJCOMs overseas operate their programs to conform to this regulation, policy direction
  and guidance provided by combatant command headquarters takes precedence. Air Force
  MAJCOMs overseas must also advise SAF/PA when taking part in any public event that will
  significantly affect operations or require major administrative, financial, or logistical support.
 6                                                                   AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010


4. Participation in Public Events. Air Force and DOD assets belong to the American people
and participation by Air Force people and display of Air Force equipment in public events
furthers public understanding of the Air Force mission. Within legal and policy limitations,
commanders at all levels who plan or conduct a community relations program must consider the
interests of the Air Force and the community as a whole. Since limitations of time and money
make it impossible to grant all requests, public affairs will take all appropriate requests into equal
consideration and recommend approval based on common factors that are in the best interests of
the Air Force and taxpayer.
5. Participation Guidelines.
     5.1. Noninterference basis. Ensure there is minimal interference with normal training or
     operational activities, determine if it is economically feasible, and make sure appropriate
     resources are available.
     5.2. Facilities. Providing government facilities such as housing and messing at government
     expense to non-DOD civilians is a prohibited type of selective benefit or favor. However,
     these services may be granted for base visits if participants reimburse costs.
     5.3. Transportation. For base visits, transportation may be provided without reimbursement,
     except airlift, if it makes the visit easier to handle and is in the best interest of the Air Force.
     Reference AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement, paragraph 3.38.
     5.4. Endorsement of Groups. Allowing groups to provide entertainment on-base to military
     people, civilian employees, or family members does not constitute an endorsement.
     Promotion of the group's objectives through handouts, speeches, program content, or other
     forms of promotion connected with the entertainment (including the period before and after
     the entertainment) is prohibited. Commanders must ensure participation is in good taste,
     appropriate in scope and type, and in keeping with the dignity of the Air Force. Participation
     should be coordinated with other military services and Air Force units if they are to be
     involved. Note: This prohibition does not apply to the publicity required to inform people of
     the event.
     5.5. Wear of Uniform. Air Force members may appear in uniform at local community-wide,
     civic-sponsored events only when the approving commander believes participation is
     appropriate and in good taste; the individuals volunteer for the assignment; there is no
     interference with military duties or operations; participation involves no additional cost to the
     government; and the event meets the basic participation criteria below. This applies to active-
     duty, reserve component, and retired military. Reference DODD 1334.1, Wearing of the
     Uniform. For questions on the wear of uniforms for public appearances, check with your
     local legal office or contact SAF/PAY at (703) 695-9664 (DSN 225-9664). For questions
     about appearing on a game show, see AFI 35-104, Media Operations, and contact SAF/PA’s
     Los Angeles field office at (310) 235-7511.
6. Participation Criteria. To ensure every planned event complies with public law and DOD
policy, at least one condition in each of the following participation criteria categories must be
met: Program, Sponsor, Support, and Site.
     6.1. Participation Criteria--Program.
         6.1.1. Approved:
AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010                                                                       7


        6.1.1.1. Directed by Public Law, executive order, or the Secretary of Defense.
        6.1.1.2. Official federal government or civil ceremonies or functions.
        6.1.1.3. Events or occasions of general interest or benefit to a local, regional, or
        national community that are open to the general public.
        6.1.1.4. In direct support of Air Force recruiting programs.
        6.1.1.5. In support of fundraising campaigns for U.S. teams or USAF teams
        competing in the Pan American or Olympic games.
        6.1.1.6. Patriotic in nature for the celebration of an official local, state, regional, or
        national holiday.
        6.1.1.7. Supporting DOD-approved united, federated, or joint fundraising campaign
        (such as the Combined Federal Campaign).
        6.1.1.8. Fundraising Events. In general the Air Force does not provide support to
        fundraising events. Limited logistical Air Force support of local fundraising
        programs may be provided when the program is local in nature and of community-
        wide interest and benefit. Support must be incidental in nature. Care must be given
        to ensure support does not give preferential treatment to a single event or cause.
            6.1.1.8.1. This logistical support must meet all of the following criteria:
               6.1.1.8.1.1. The event will not interfere with the performance of official
               duties or detract from readiness.
            6.1.1.8.1.2.    Community relations with the local community and other
            PA/military training interests are served by the support.
               6.1.1.8.1.3. The association of the AF and DoD with the event is in our best
               interest.
               6.1.1.8.1.4. The event is of interest and benefit to the local community as a
               whole, the base, command or organization providing the support.
               6.1.1.8.1.5. The organization providing logistical support is able and willing
               to provide similar support to similar non-federal entity events that meet the
               criteria (what you do for one you must be willing to do for all).
               6.1.1.8.1.6. No admission fee will be charged for the portion of the event
               supported by the AF beyond what will cover the actual costs of sponsoring
               the event.
               6.1.1.8.1.7. A military band or choral group, or portion of a group, flyover or
               static display is not logistical support and is generally not available to support
               non-federal entity fundraising events. For more information, contact the base
               legal office or your higher headquarters.
     6.1.2. Disapproved.

           program is for the entire community and not to promote the organization’s objectives.
           6.2.1.5. A commercial enterprise when Air Force support is patriotic in nature, is
           incidental to the primary program, and does not selectively benefit the commercial

           educational, patriotic, or recruiting program. (Flyovers are        not automatically
           approved; see Section C for guidance.)
           6.2.1.7. A religious group, if programs are of community-wide interest, nonsectarian,
           and broadly promoted.

           organization’s objectives.
AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010                                                                    9


         6.2.2.2. A commercial enterprise, unless Air Force support is patriotic, incidental to

           6.4.1.6. In a building or facility used for religious purpose, when programs are of
           community-wide interest, nonsectarian, and broadly promoted.
           6.4.1.7. In a shopping mall or center only when programs are directly related to
           recruiting or patriotic activities and do not appear to selectively benefit any

           non-public school, college, or university, except as specified in paragraph 6.4.1.5.
7. Funding Requirements. Air Force policy is to keep costs to a minimum. Participation
requiring additional cost to the government should be avoided unless considered in the best
interest of the Air Force. Payment for these costs is based on two event categories: Primary
Interest--all costs borne by the Air Force unit or units involved and Mutual Interest--costs are
shared by the Air Force and the sponsor. Scheduled training or troop movements that are viewed
by the public are considered incidental to training and not a Public Affairs function. The
following guidelines apply:
   7.1. Primary Interest. Primary interest events can include those requiring SAF/PA and
   OASD/PA approval and those that may be approved by the local unit commander. In either
   case, the participating unit incurs all costs.
       7.1.1. Events for which the participating unit is authorized to bear all costs might include
       DOD requirements, Air Force or civic-sponsored public observances of the United States
       or a host country, other official ceremonies or functions, or speaking engagements.
   7.2. Mutual Interest. Events identified as Mutual Interest are carried out with the civilian
   sponsor.
       7.2.1. The participating unit is responsible for Air Force costs of participation unless
       advised otherwise by higher authority. Units must budget for these costs in annual
       financial plans. The unit's costs are those continuing costs that exist even if the Air Force
       did not participate. These include pay, allowances, and incidental expenses.
       7.2.2. The cost of opportune airlift or routine flights in military aircraft for transportation
       of people and exhibit materials is also an Air Force share of costs. This only applies to
       the support of other military services whose participation in an event has been authorized.
           7.2.2.1. Civilian sponsor must reimburse the Air Force for additional costs, including
           but not limited to the following: travel cost of military personnel and equipment; per
           diem payable under federal joint travel regulations; cost of shipping exhibit materials
           when commercial means are used; any rental space, utilities, or custodial services;
AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010                                                                        11


           and cost of shipping aviation fuel if it is not available at a military contract price at
           the required location.
       7.2.3. Also included are any additional services determined necessary by the
       participating units and agreed on by the civilian sponsor. MAJCOMs may waive the per
       diem cost payment requirement and accept locally furnished meals and quarters but only
       if they meet military standards. This waiver authority may not be delegated to a lower
       authority even if such items are accepted without prior approval.
       7.2.4. Sponsors must also provide local area ground transportation, exhibits, space,
       utilities, custodial services, or any other required services.

Section C—-Use of Military Aircraft for Events

8. General Guidance. The Air Force takes part in events at military and civilian locations to
keep the public and military informed of U.S. preparedness, to demonstrate modern weapons
systems, to promote good community and international relations, to support Air Force recruiting
and retention efforts, and to render military honors. Flyovers of public events in support of
community relation activities must be flown as an addition to an approved training mission. Air
Force participation in any public event shall be in keeping with DODD 5410.18, Public Affairs
Community Relations Policy, and DODI 5410.19, Public Affairs Community Relations Policy
Implementation. Authority to approve most requests from organizations requesting off-base
aviation support has been delegated by the OASD/PA to the military services. Per delegation
from the Secretary of the Air Force memorandum “Exception to Policy Flyover Approval
Request”, dated 10 Aug 1998, the approval authority for Air Force participation in such events is
SAF/PA in coordination with AF/A3/5. Safety is the primary consideration. All pertinent safety
regulations of the Department of Defense, Department of the Air Force, and the Federal Aviation
Administration shall be strictly enforced. Air Force participation at events requires approval for
eligibility and level of support (SAF/PAY) and participation approval (AF/A3O). While the
public affairs community approves the appropriateness of an event for Air Force participation,
the operations community concurs on the operational issues impacting the feasibility and cost of
the participation.
   8.1. SAF/PAY is the approval authority for all Air Force aviation public event requests
   including those in support of patriotic holidays. SAF/PAY determines eligibility, IAW DOD
   and AF policy, for all aviation-related events and non-aviation-related events.
   8.2. Use of any aircraft or equipment undergoing testing in a research and development
   (R&D) program must be approved by AF/A3/5 and SAF/AQ. Submit these requests, through
   channels, to AF/A3O (Info: AF/A3O-AO) at least 60 days before the event date.
   8.3. All events scheduled for or that may attract national or international media coverage
   must be coordinated with SAF/PA and OASD/PA. Send requests, through PA channels, to
   SAF/PAY at least 45 days before the event date or as soon as the event is known.
9. On-Base Public Events. Military units sponsoring one or more aerial events on a military
installation when the event is open to the public will submit requests via the DD Form 2535.
10. Use of Military Aircraft for Off-Base Public Events. Requests for off-base flyovers will
be considered by SAF/PAY only for aviation-oriented events (i.e., air shows, airport
anniversaries or dedications) or for patriotic observances held in conjunction with formal
 12                                                             AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010


observances, open to the public, on Armed Forces Day (third Saturday in May), Memorial Day
(last Monday in May), Independence Day (4 July), Prisoner Of War/Missing in Action
(POW/MIA) Recognition Day (third Friday in September), and Veterans Day (11 November)
when held within seven days of the holiday date. Exceptions-to-policy for events other than
those listed above shall be considered by SAF/PAY on a case-by-case basis after determining
appropriateness and benefit of Air Force participation. Note: Sporting events require SAF/PAY
exception-to-policy approval regardless of the date. For example, a professional or local
baseball game on July 4th must be approved by SAF/PAY.
   10.1. All requests received for use of military aircraft at a location in North America must be
   completed via the DD Form 2535. If necessary, assist the sponsor in filling out the request,
   ensuring a hard copy of the request is printed, required signatures are obtained, and it is
   forwarded to SAF/PAY within required time constraints. Be cautious not to give the
   impression of approval before event is officially approved by higher headquarters. Note:
   Requests are not processed until all required signatures including event site certifier and
   Federal Aviation Administration coordination are received by SAF/PAY.
   10.2. Overseas Requests. For overseas units, authority for aircraft participation at civilian
   locations is delegated to the appropriate combatant commander. If applicable, concurrence
   of MAJCOM with operational control of assets requested is required. Overseas requests for
   CONUS-based assets to specifically deploy in support of an air show or other public event
   (i.e., Paris Air Show or Farnborough Air Show) should be addressed to SAF/PAY and
   AF/A3O-AO at least 60 days before the event.
   10.3. Non-Aviation-Related Events. Requests for non-aviation-related event exceptions-to-
   policy flyovers and single ship tactical demonstrations should reach SAF/PAY at least 45
   days before the event. Requests received within 14 days of the event will not be considered.
   Non-aviation-related events taking place on the five patriotic holidays still require an
   exception-to-policy if the events are previously scheduled (i.e. sporting events that would
   take place in spite of the holiday).
   10.4. Aerial Events Message. An aerial events message will be distributed annually to
   specify the types of exception-to-policy events that will and will not be eligible for support
   by the Air Force, and pre-determine the proper level of support.

Section D—-Use of Aerial Demonstration Teams and Parachute Teams

11. Thunderbirds. Demonstrations by the Thunderbirds are flown only over airports, large
bodies of water, or unpopulated areas. Requests for performances must reach SAF/PAY no later
than 1 August to be considered for the following calendar year’s schedule.
   11.1. Performances on Air Force Bases. Aerial demonstrations at Air Force bases are
   requested by Public Affairs through the MAJCOM to SAF/PAY by 1 August. Priority will
   be given to bases that request two-day shows. Requests for the Navy’s Blue Angels and the
   Army’s Golden Knights are submitted to the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army Public Affairs offices
   indicated on page 4 of DD Form 2535. Requests for the Canadian Snowbirds are submitted
   to the 431st Air Demonstration Squadron, PO Box 5000, Moose Jaw, SK S6H 7Z8. For more
   information and a copy of the request form, visit the team’s website:
   http://www.snowbirds.dnd.ca.
AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010                                                                      13


   11.2. Performances on Other-Than-Air-Force Military Installations. Requests for Air Force
   aircraft must be submitted to SAF/PAY for review and submission to the Thunderbirds by 1
   August of the previous year. The individual or agency sponsoring the event must send the
   completed DD Form 2535 directly to SAF/PAY. Air Force Public Affairs offices may assist
   sponsors with the DD Form 2535 but will not submit the request for the sponsor to avoid any
   perception that the Air Force will approve the request. The Secretary of the Air Force is the
   approval authority for the Thunderbirds aerial demonstration team schedule.
   11.3. Cancellations. If a PA office is notified of a cancellation of an off-base performance,
   encourage the sponsor to notify the Thunderbirds immediately if they have not already done
   so. A unit canceling a performance by the Thunderbirds at its base must immediately send
   an e-mail message listing the date the performance was scheduled, place, reason for
   cancellation, and person canceling the performance (with phone number and affiliation, if
   possible, for a civilian site), through PA channels to its headquarters with the following as
   information or action addressees: SAF/PAY, AF/A3O, and ACC/PA/A3.
   11.4. All activities undertaken by the Thunderbirds that are likely to result in national media
   exposure (i.e. videos, orientation flights, and television appearances) must be reported to
   SAF/PAY.
   11.5. All events eligible for Thunderbirds support will be posted for internal use to the Air
   Force Aerial Events website: www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil.
12. Foreign Demonstration Teams. Performances by government-sponsored foreign
demonstration teams at Air Force installations can enhance international goodwill. Questions
regarding performances by foreign teams in the United States may be telephonically addressed to
SAF/PAY or AF/A3O-AO.
13. Parachute Demonstrations. Parachute demonstrations are restricted to appropriate events
over airports, open bodies of water, or areas of land where adequate crowd control can be
assured.
   13.1. Requests for off-base parachute demonstrations at locations other than those specified
   must receive approval as an exception-to-policy. Participation is usually limited to three
   days for any one event.
   13.2. Only one parachute team or club from each military service may take part in the same
   public event.
   13.3. Participation by official parachute teams, parachute sports clubs, or qualified
   individuals in competitive parachute meets sanctioned by the United States Parachute
   Association (USPA) may be authorized provided such competitions are not with a public
   event such as a fair, exposition, or similar event. Under the above criteria, an insurance bond
   is not required for participants in USPA events.

Section E—-Types of Aviation Support and Approval Levels.

14. Static Displays.
   14.1. On-Base Public Event.
 14                                                               AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010


       14.1.1. Small Public Events. The owning commander has approval authority for static
       displays for events like base tours as long as the aircraft is not a new weapon system and
       is in the inventory.
       14.1.2. Large Public Events. MAJCOMs may approve on-base static displays for
       assigned operational resources not in conjunction with a retirement or change of
       command ceremony.
       14.1.3. Civilian Aircraft. MAJCOMs may approve static display of civilian aircraft on
       their command’s bases. Civilian participation should be at no additional cost to the U.S.
       Government. See AFI 34-407, Air Force Commercial Sponsorship Program, and AFI
       34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility, for guidance.
       14.1.4. Static displays do not require FAA approval.
       14.1.5. Static displays should have at least one qualified crewmember available to
       answer questions from spectators and to ensure security.
       14.1.6. Static displays used in conjunction with retirement or change of command
       ceremonies will consist only of aircraft assigned to the base where the ceremony is
       occurring. For complete guidance on retirements and changes of command, refer to AFI
       11-209, Air Force Aerial Events.
   14.2. Off-Base Public Events.
       14.2.1. Authorized only at airfields, heliports, and landing sites meeting the
       qualifications prescribed in AFI 13-218, Air Traffic System Evaluation Program, as
       supplemented by MAJCOMs.
       14.2.2. Static displays should have at least one qualified crewmember available to
       answer questions from spectators and to ensure security.
       14.2.3. Static displays do not require FAA approval.
15. Flyovers. A flyover, whether on-base or off-base, is a straight and level flight, limited to
one pass by no more than four military aircraft of the same general type (e.g., tactical, transport,
rotary wing) from the same military service over a predetermined point on the ground at a
specific time and not involving aerobatics or demonstrations. A flyover of more than four
aircraft, of multiple types of aircraft, or of aircraft representing more than one military service or
nation, regardless of horizontal/timing separation of flying elements, constitutes an aerial review.
Flyovers at memorial or funeral services in honor of rated and/or designated active-duty aviation
personnel are not community relations activities. In those cases, Mortuary Affairs and AF/A3O
shall determine applicability of a flyover.
   15.1. General Approval Process. SAF/PAY is responsible for and tasked with ensuring that
   air shows, flyovers, Air Force parachute team (AFPT) demonstrations, static displays, and
   non-aviation events that desire Air Force aviation participation are appropriate events for Air
   Force support. Unified combatant commanders, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy,
   and OSD officials also have roles in specific cases to deem an event eligible or ineligible for
   military participation. Event sponsors are required to accomplish a DD Form 2535. Once
   the completed DD Form 2535 is reviewed by SAF/PAY and the event is determined eligible
   for Air Force participation, the event is published on the Public Affairs aviation web site
   (www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil) for Air Force flying units and PA offices to review and
AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010                                                                        15


  volunteer to support specific events. Complete request procedures, additional information
  and internal policies and regulations can be obtained from the Air Force Aviation Support
  web site (www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil).
  15.2. Units wishing to volunteer to support an event must indicate their intent on the
  website. Support must then be approved by MAJCOM/A3. Sponsors of events may contact
  a unit to solicit participation in their particular event. Units should not rely on the sponsor to
  notify SAF/PAY.
  15.3. National Guard Training Academy. The Air National Guard (ANG) Academy of
  Military Science, McGhee Tyson ANGB, Tennessee, is considered an on-base location for
  the purpose of graduation flyovers and other approved events.
  15.4. U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA). All definitions and policies regarding flyovers
  and aerial reviews apply to the USAFA. Examples of approved Academy events include
  graduation ceremonies, football games, parades, and other events with a patriotic/military
  theme. The commandant requests appropriate Air Force participation, which is limited to
  flyovers, parachute demonstrations, and glider demonstrations. MAJCOM commanders may
  approve these flyovers, either as proffered support or in response to requests from USAFA.
     15.4.1. USAFA officials may need to notify each participating MAJCOM when flyovers
     are scheduled by more than one MAJCOM on the same day. When more than one
     flyover event is scheduled within any three-hour time frame, this notification to
     MAJCOMs will include as a minimum: flyover timing, number of aircraft in each flight,
     direction of flight, altitude, USAFA point of contact, and other information deemed
     necessary for safety of flight. When separate flyovers are more than three hours apart,
     other MAJCOM notification is encouraged.
     15.4.2. For each event, the flyover will consist of not more than four aircraft of the same
     type making one pass.
     15.4.3. USAFA officials will notify AF/A3O-AO and SAF/PAY 10 days before the
     event date of any flyover that may have national media coverage.
  15.5. Off-Base Public Event. Event-eligibility determination is provided by SAF/PAY. Air
  Force evaluation of aviation support for off-base events is based on the theme and purpose of
  the event, the sponsoring organization, anticipated audience, assets requested, and the
  benefits of participation to the Air Force.
     15.5.1. Single flyovers. Authorized flyovers include no more than four aircraft of the
     same type, making one pass only, in support of aviation-related events, or Armed Forces
     Day (3rd Saturday in May), Memorial Day (last Monday in May), Independence Day
     (July 4), POW/MIA Recognition Day (3rd Friday in September), and Veterans Day
     (November 11). Flyovers must occur within seven days before or after the national day
     of observance and must directly support the holiday commemoration. All patriotic
     holiday events, including sporting events that fall within the seven day window, require
     SAF/PAY approval.
     15.5.2. Multiple passes. Multiple passes by the same formation at any off-base event are
     not authorized. Send request for waiver to AF/A3O-AO. Submit these requests, through
 16                                                              AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010


       MAJCOM leadership, to AF/A3O-AO (send information to SAF/PAY) at least 15 days
       before the event date.
   15.5.3. SAF/PAY coordinates all eligible events with AF/A3O to determine the extent of
   operational participation authorized, which is outlined in the Annual Aerial Events Message.
   15.6. Requests for missing-man formation. The missing-man formation is authorized for use
   at ceremonies commemorating Memorial Day, POW/MIA Recognition Day, Veterans Day,
   and at other suitable events when the theme is solemn in nature and when the event is not
   held in conjunction with another event (e.g. sporting events or air shows). The missing-man
   formation shall not be flown at CONUS public events without the approval of AF/A3O in
   coordination with SAF/PAY.
       15.6.1. For OCONUS commands, U.S. military support for Memorial Day events at U.S.
       military cemeteries overseas is a key community relations activity. All wings are
       encouraged to support these requests to the maximum extent possible.
           15.6.1.1. While determination of event eligibility rests with the unified or combatant
           commander, approval for missing-man flyovers at Memorial Day events at U.S.
           cemeteries overseas is delegated to the supporting MAJCOM.
16. Aerial Review. A flyover of more than four aircraft, of multiple types of aircraft, or of
aircraft representing more than one military service or nation, regardless of horizontal/timing
separation of flying elements, constitutes an aerial review. A single element involving four or
less aircraft of different airframes but of the same general type (e.g. two F-16s and two F-15s) is
not considered an aerial review. However, this formation should be undertaken only with
applicable consideration given to safety, compatible flying characteristics, and the overall theme
of the event that is being supported. Air show flights are exempt.
   16.1. Aerial reviews are reserved only for the most meaningful occasions and shall not be
   scheduled or performed at CONUS events without initial review and approval by SAF/PAY
   and AF/A3O (with Combatant Command initial review and approval for OCONUS events),
   and with final approval granted by OASD/PA. Submit these requests, through MAJCOM
   leadership, to SAF/PAY (information to AF/A3O-AO) 45 days before the event date.
   16.2. Multi-Service or multi-nation aerial reviews on or off base may require additional
   approval. Refer to AFI 11-209 for specific guidance. Submit these requests, through
   MAJCOM leadership, to SAF/PAY (also send information to AF/A3O-AO) at least 45 days
   before the event date.
   16.3. The unit making the initial request will submit these requests, through PA channels, to
   SAF/PAY (also send information to AF/A3O-AO) at least 45 days before the event date.
   16.4. As distinctly diverse assets, the combination of a parachute jump and flyover or a
   flyover and aircraft demonstration (not to exceed a total of four elements) will not be
   performed at public events without approval by SAF/PAY and AF/A3O. Use of such
   aviation assets will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Approval will be based on the
   supportive justification as to the significance of the event and the ability to provide such
   resources at no additional costs to the government.
AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010                                                                       17


17. Aircraft Demonstrations. Aerial demonstration is a generic phrase that includes virtually
every type of aerial participation in public or military events (except for aerial review and
flyover) to include aerobatics, aircraft capabilities demonstrations, assault landing/takeoffs,
aircraft weapons or tactics demonstrations, MAJCOM Vintage Aircraft Programs, airdrop
demonstrations of personnel or equipment, and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR)
demonstrations. It is used interchangeably with the phrase aircraft demonstration. MAJCOMs
may approve demonstrations by their assigned operational assets on their command bases.
MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM requests for these aerial events are approved by the MAJCOM owning
the requested assets. For notification requirements, refer to paragraph 15.2.
   17.1. . Activities such as mass parachute jumps (those involving more than one aircraft),
   aerial delivery (airdrop) of equipment, aircraft assault demonstrations, and tactical helicopter
   troop landings (those involving more than four aircraft or involving more than one military
   service) under simulated tactical conditions shall not be performed at CONUS public events
   without initial review and approval by SAF/PAY and AF/A3O. Submit these requests,
   through MAJCOM PA, to SAF/PAY (also send information to AF/A3O-AO) 45 days before
   the event date.
18. Jump Platform.
   18.1. On-Base.
       18.1.1. MAJCOM/A3 may approve use of their assigned operational assets on their
       command bases. For notification requirements, refer to paragraph 15.2.
       18.1.2. MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM requests for a jump platform are approved by the
       MAJCOM owning the requested assets.
       18.1.3. If the request is for an Air Mobility Command (AMC) asset, submit requirements
       to HQ AMC/A3OO at least 45 days before the event date for consideration at the
       monthly Joint Airborne and Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT) planning conference.
   18.2. Off-Base.
       18.2.1. When a military unit is making the initial request, submit these requests, through
       PA channels, to SAF/PAY (also send information to AF/A3O) at least 45 days before the
       event date. SAF/PAY coordinates all approved events with AF/A3O to determine extent
       of operational participation authorized.
       18.2.2. If the request is for an AMC asset, submit requirements to HQ AMC/A3OO at
       least 60 days before event date for approval or disapproval at the monthly JA/ATT
       planning conference.
19. Memorial or Funeral Ceremony--Aerial Event. All requirements must be validated with
Mortuary Affairs. Refer to AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program, and AFI 11-209 for
guidance.
20. Retirement and Change of Command Ceremonies--Aerial Event.
   20.1. On Base.
       20.1.1. These military events are approved for only the following personnel: Chief of
       Staff of the Air Force (CSAF), Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force (VCSAF), Combatant
       Commander (COCOM), MAJCOM commander or vice commander, NAF commander,
 18                                                              AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010


       Center commander, or State Adjutant Generals. Any other aerial events for the sole
       purpose of recognizing individuals who are retiring or for change-of-command
       ceremonies are prohibited without the consent of the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff.
       AF/CV will approve on a case-by-case basis. Submit these requests, through command
       channels, to HQ USAF/A3 and HQ USAF/A3OO at least 45 days before the event date.
   20.2. Off-Base. Aerial events for retirement or change of command ceremonies are not
   authorized at any off-base locations.
   20.3. Refer to AFI 11-209 for complete guidance.
21. Performance Record Attempts--On Base or Off Base.
   21.1. The Air Force may compete, where appropriate, for official world and "world class"
   records and participate, on a selective basis, in flights of a spectacular nature. Record
   attempts are restricted to aircraft that have been assigned to operational units for at least six
   months and should not imply competition among the services. Aircraft altitude, speed,
   endurance, and individual performance record attempts must be concerned with keeping the
   public appraised of U.S. engineering technology capabilities. MAJCOMs are encouraged to
   evaluate resources on a recurring basis to determine their capability to establish a new record
   or to reclaim existing ones.
   21.2. A MAJCOM desiring to perform a record flight or flight of a spectacular nature will
   first determine that the flight would not be of excessive cost or detract from operational
   posture. After these determinations are made, submit the request to HQ USAF/A3O (also
   send information to SAF/PAY), including the type of flight to be flown, record to be
   established or reclaimed, and the total cost of the attempt, at least 45 days before the event
   date.
   21.3. Requests to establish or reclaim an aeronautical record must be approved at a
   minimum by CSAF, HQ USAF/A3 and SAF/PAY before requesting OASD/PA approval.
   Additionally, SAF/AQ must also approve the use of any aircraft or equipment in an R&D
   program.
22. Civilian Aerial Demonstrations On Base. Air Force policy on civilian aerial
demonstrations and performances for on-base events sets awareness of aviation heritage as a
primary objective. While it is the intent of HQ USAF that DOD aerial demonstration teams
normally will perform aerobatics at or over Air Force installations, qualified civilian performers
may be permitted to provide aerial demonstrations, flyovers, and static displays to supplement or
augment DOD teams. Commanders must select civilian organizations whose aircraft are of
historic military significance and whose performances clearly reinforce and promote a better
understanding of the Air Force. The clear majority of performances must be military related.
23. Supporting Special Events. Requests for non-aviation-related military support of public
programs should be addressed to the nearest military installation, using the DD Form 2536,
Request for Armed Forces Participation in Public Events (Non-Aviation). Decision criteria
should include the nature of the program, sponsor, site, and support. Commanders may authorize
local program support without further authorization. The DD Form 2536 is designed to aid
civilian sponsors and provide required information for approval authority. When possible, PA
should provide the sponsor with the form and assist the sponsor in filling out the form
completely. PA should also contact the local recruiter if appropriate. Additional consideration
AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010                                                                       19


should be given to integrating military assets into key civilian events and ensuring proper Air
Force message placement in all public events.
   23.1. All requests for Air Force support within the National Capital Region must be sent to
   SAF/PAY using DD Form 2536. Requests must be sent to SAF/PAY at least 60 days before
   the event date or as soon as the event is known and will be coordinated with OASD/PA as
   appropriate.
   23.2. When OSD, the Secretariat, or HQ USAF receives direct requests from civilian
   sponsors, SAF/PAY will ask the MAJCOMs with the base closest to the requester to appoint
   a project officer to coordinate all Air Force participation at that approved event (i.e. Armed
   Forces Day, Veterans Day). The project officer should establish initial contact with the
   sponsor as soon as possible and maintain close liaison to assure the sponsor that the Air
   Force will provide assistance and participation as appropriate. Project officers are authorized
   direct communication with participating commands and military services. Provide SAF/PAY
   a report of all planned participation at least 15 days before the event and a brief after-action
   report within 30 days after the event.
   23.3. All events scheduled for or that may attract national or international media coverage
   must be sent to SAF/PAY at least 45 days before the event date or as soon as the event is
   known.
   23.4. Exceptions to policy will be kept to a minimum. Any requests for exceptions must be
   approved by the unit commander and concurred with by the MAJCOM Director of
   Operations and PA as appropriate before submission to SAF/PAY.

Section F—-Interagency Programs

24. Air Force Participation in Interagency Programs. Occasionally, the Air Force takes part
in and supports interagency exhibits and programs such as the Paris Air Show, Royal
International Air Tattoo (RIAT), or the Farnborough Air Show. Each Air Force component of a
combatant or specified command is guided by the policy on interagency programs issued by that
command. However, the policy stated below on programming, preparing budget estimates, and
financing Air Force participation in interagency programs applies to all Air Force activities.
   24.1. Coordination. The Air Force must work through, and obtain approval from, OASD/PA
   on all interagency programs. In supporting such programs, the Air Force objectives are to
   strengthen its community relations program and provide Public Affairs support to all Air
   Force activities worldwide. Therefore, when the objectives of the event are social, cultural,
   or economic, orient Air Force participation toward community relations.
   24.2. Coordination Between OASD/PA and SAF/PAY. The Air Force point of contact with
   OASD/PA is SAF/PAY. When an Air Force component receives a request to take part in or
   to support an interagency action, it must send that request through PA channels to SAF/PAY
   for determination and processing through OASD/PA.
   24.3. Presidential Authorization for Programs. When the President feels U.S. participation
   in an international fair or other public or private demonstration of U.S. economic and cultural
   progress will strengthen international relations, the President authorizes such participation.
 20                                                               AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010


   24.4. Loan of Property. The Air Force may provide property (including foreign excess
   property) on a loan basis to the manager of a U.S. national exhibition or commercial
   exhibition under conditions approved by SAF/PA. This property may include, for example,
   electric generators, office equipment, or expendable items. When the purpose of the loan has
   been fulfilled, the property must be returned. Costs, including loss, any necessary repairs,
   reconditioning after use, and transportation must be borne by the requesting agency.

Section G—-Speeches and Public Appearances

25. Acceptance Criteria. Official public appearances and speeches by Air Force people,
military or civilian, constitute essential parts of the Air Force program to keep the public
informed. Individual members of the Air Force at all levels, but particularly general officers and
other key personnel, should make every effort to fill requests unless overriding or previous
official commitment precludes acceptance. Apply the following criteria:
   25.1. Participation does not interfere with assigned duties.
   25.2. Remarks are confined to discussion of subjects within the Air Force and speaker’s
   purview.
   25.3. Views expressed are nonpartisan, consistent with AFI 51-902, Political Activities by
   Members of the U.S. Air Force.
   25.4. Participation does not imply Air Force sponsorship or agreement with the statements of
   others that may be partisan in nature or contrary to national policy.
   25.5. Participation does not violate DOD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation.
26. Security and Policy Review. Speakers must have their speeches reviewed for security and
policy issues at the appropriate level. See AFI 35-102, Security and Policy Review, for complete
information.
27. Payment and Honoraria. Payment or honoraria cannot be accepted for making an official
on- or off-duty public appearance or speech done as part of official duties. However, payment
and honoraria can be accepted for public appearances or speeches that are done off duty and are
unrelated to official duties. Consult the installation Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) for more
information. Refer to DOD 5500.7-R.
   27.1. Travel Expenses. Funded TDY is authorized to support approved events; however, in
   some cases, official travel expenses can be paid by the organization requesting a speaker.
   Coordinate with the SJA.
   27.2. Federal government employees shall not accept any gift of value given to them
   because of their government position or by a "prohibited source." Gifts valued under $20
   may be accepted under the "de minimus" rule, one of many gift exceptions for DOD
   personnel. If the gift is valued at more than $20 or results in gifts totaling more than $50
   received from the same source in a calendar year, do not reject it outright. Contact your local
   SJA office to determine if the gift can be accepted.
28. U.S. Air Force Representation at Events in the National Capital Region.
   28.1. Personal Responsibilities.
AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010                                                                     21


       28.1.1. Invitations for Air Force military or civilians who are invited to speak or appear
       at public events in the National Capital Region (NCR) must be reported to SAF/PAY
       (NCRinvites@pentagon.af.mil) immediately upon receipt.
       28.1.2. Indicate whether the invitation will be accepted, declined, and request guidance
       from SAF/PA.
   28.2. Unit Responsibilities.
       28.2.1. Units that are responsible for local community relations programs in the
       NCR/Washington Metropolitan Area do not need to coordinate events that have only
       local impact unless senior Air Force leaders are involved.
       28.2.2. Exceptions are events sponsored by or in honor of foreign nationals. Invitations
       in honor of foreign dignitaries should be reported to SAF/IA, DSN 225-7262 or (703)
       695-7262, according to AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds—Guidance and
       Procedures.
       28.2.3. Air Force Protocol, DSN 227-8341 or (703) 697-8341, provides advice on state
       and official functions.
   28.3. SAF/PA Responsibilities. SAF/PAY has an established process to vet, advise, and
   approve engagements and speaking opportunities in the NCR. SAF/PAY advises whether or
   not attendance is desirable, optional, or inadvisable and assists in making sure legal
   requirements are met. If you receive a request to have a speaker or attendee participate in an
   event in the NCR, you must e-mail SAF/PAY at NCRinvites@pentagon.af.mil. Further
   guidance will be provided and senior leadership will be informed.
29. Congratulatory Messages. Anniversary messages from the Secretary of the Air Force and
Chief of Staff must be requested; they are not issued automatically. MAJCOM anniversaries
may be recognized at five-year intervals and bases on their 50th anniversaries. Other requests
for messages should be carefully considered before being submitted.
   29.1. Requests from MAJCOMs, bases, public groups, or individuals are handled by
   SAF/PAY.
   29.2. Requests from foreign units and governments should be referred to SAF/IA.
   29.3. All requests must be received at least 45 days in advance of the anniversary date and
   should include the following information: recommended text; full name, title, grade, and
   organization of the person to whom the message is to be addressed; brief outline of the event,
   to include date, time, place, and other information; how message will be used; date the
   message should be received by the requester; other material useful as background
   information about the event or to support the recommended message.
   29.4. To request congratulatory messages from higher-ranking government officials,
   although rarely done, use above guidelines.
30. Inviting Distinguished Visitors. Air Force units may invite distinguished visitors to attend
appropriate functions.
   30.1. Government Officials. SAF/PAY should be notified if invitations are sent to the
   following distinguished individuals: members of the Supreme Court, Cabinet Secretaries, and
   Principal Deputies to Cabinet Secretaries.
 22                                                           AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010


       30.1.1. Commands must favorably endorse invitations for them to receive approval at
       HQ Air Force level.
       30.1.2. Air University and USAFA. Correspond directly with Cabinet Officers and
       Principal Deputies to Cabinet Officers to speak or appear at academic functions. On
       acceptance of any such invitation, notify SAF/PAY immediately.
       30.1.3. President, Vice President and Members of Congress. Invitations to the President
       of the United States, Vice President, and members of the Congress should be processed
       according to AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations with Congress.
   30.2. Military Officials. Invitations may be made directly by or through commanders of
   MAJCOMs or FOAs to senior officials up to and including the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of
   Staff; the Secretary or Chief of Staff of the Army; the Secretary of the Navy or the Chief of
   Naval Operations; the Secretary or Chief of Staff of the Air Force; or the Commandant, U.S.
   Marine Corps. When an invitation from an Air Force unit is accepted by any of the officials
   listed above, notify SAF/PAY immediately.
   30.3. Foreign Nationals. Invitations from CONUS commanders to foreign nationals to visit
   U.S. Air Force facilities or to take part in U.S. Air Force-sponsored functions must be
   approved by SAF/IA.
   30.4. Invitations to other distinguished visitors are procedural matters for commands.
   However, advise SAF/PAY immediately when the appearance of a distinguished visitor at an
   Air Force function is considered likely to attract national attention. Note: Invitations for
   citizens of national prominence to take part in or attend memorial and dedication programs
   are processed according to AFI 36-3108, Memorialization Program and Ceremonies.
   30.5. Congressional Visits. Information concerning visits by members of Congress is found
   in AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations with Congress.
   30.6. Joint Civilian Orientation Conference (JCOC). This is a twice annual conference
   arranged by OASD/PA and includes interested civilian opinion leaders who are personally
   invited by the Secretary of Defense and briefed on military affairs and taken on tours of
   Department of Defense installations within different Combatant Commands. These tours
   should be given the highest priority since they are SECDEF sponsored with assistance from
   OASD/PA and SAF/PAY. SAF/PA sends a message to Air Force units annually requesting
   nominations. The message outlines nominee criteria and instructions for submission. The
   JCOC web site is located at http://jcoc.DOD.mil/.

Section H—-Air Force Tour Program

31. General Guidelines. The Air Force Tour Program increases opinion and community
leaders’ awareness and understanding of the Air Force’s role in national security by inviting
groups of civilian opinion leaders to witness the Air Force mission by visiting Air Force
installations. Air Force units carefully select candidates who are capable of disseminating
information to various publics about the Air Force’s programs. Participants may travel on
military transportation, including aircraft, to view the Air Force in action in accordance with
DOD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, and AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010                                                                      23


   31.1. All Air Force tours are conducted under the same basic guidelines, and there are
   different types of tours--National Civic Outreach, Community Relations, and base tours.
      31.1.1. Prior to planning or scheduling any Air Force National Civic Outreach or
      Community Relations tour other than a routine base tour, a tour plan template must be
      completed and forwarded to the MAJCOM Public Affairs office for concurrence and
      appropriate command-level approval. MAJCOMs sponsoring tours must submit the
      completed tour plan template to SAF/PAY for review. The template serves as a valuable
      planning tool and a means to ensure a tour is the appropriate tool to reach the
      communication objective(s) and to bring more focus, efficiency, and integrity to the
      overall Air Force Tour Program.
   31.2. Tours will adhere to OASD/PA guidance that civilian visitors are not permitted to
   operate any item of military equipment when such operation could cause, or reasonably be
   perceived as causing, an increased safety risk. This policy is designed to ensure visits are
   conducted as safely as possible. This policy specifically includes any aspect of the actual
   operation of military vessels, aircraft, vehicles, and crew-served weapons systems. Small
   arms weapons firing may be allowed with local commander approval.
      31.2.1. Tours are not intended to produce media coverage; however, media queries
      concerning the program or a specific tour must be answered factually, completely, and in
      a timely manner. Tour participants must be advised prior to the event that names,
      business affiliations, and any other information releasable under FOIA will be released if
      queried by the media.
      31.2.2. Working members of the press and members of the U.S. Congress and their staff
      will not be included in community relations tours since there are programs in place for
      these groups. Members of local and state government, however, may be included.
      31.2.3. In areas where major units are collocated, the tour host will coordinate tour plans
      and guest lists with other Air Force Public Affairs offices in the area before extending
      invitations.
      31.2.4. Local Air Force recruiting squadron commander and/or recruiters, AFROTC
      detachments, ANG and AF Reserve sources as well as area bases should be contacted for
      suggested tour invitees.
      31.2.5. Commands are responsible for adhering to the provisions of this instruction,
      including requests for any required higher headquarters approval.
      31.2.6. The Air Force Tour Program must withstand scrutiny at all times. Activities
      perceived as extravagant jeopardize the viability of this program.
32. National Civic Outreach Tours.
   32.1. Nationally Sponsored.
   32.2. SAF/PAY manages the overall annual Air Force Tour Program, overseeing tours
   which are national in scope. SAF/PAY and MAJCOMs will coordinate to assign execution
   responsibility for individual tours. Additional themes for national civic outreach tours may be
   proposed at lower echelons and submitted through MAJCOMs along with the tour plan
   template to SAF/PAY for approval.
 24                                                            AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010


   32.3. Issues, focus, or themes must have more than local or regional impact.
   32.4. The target audience is composed of stakeholders generally associated with a major

   SAF/PAY. Submit requests for waiver prior to invitations being sent out to SAF/PAY and
   include an itinerary and a letter of justification. Due to the longer flying times for PACAF
   and USAFE unit tours, PACAF is allowed four-day tours and USAFE three-day tours, if
   approved by MAJCOM. Tour durations which exceed any of these limits require a waiver
   approved by SAF/PAY. Air National Guard tours will be conducted in accordance with
   National Guard Bureau (NGB) Public Affairs Manual 360-5.
AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010                                                                      25

 26                                                             AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010


   34.20. Do not provide alcoholic beverages to guests aboard aircraft and buses or during any
   business briefings.
   34.21. Do not include spouses or retired military members unless they qualify as bona fide
   opinion leaders in their own right.
   34.22. Evening activities should be an integral part of the education process, not purely a
   social event. Use the time for appropriate speakers and interaction with leadership. If
   available, include a performance by an element of an Air Force Band.
35. Participant Requirements.
   35.1. Must confirm they are in good health and physical condition.
   35.2. Must assume full financial responsibility for their own lodging, meals, and other
   expenses during the tour.
   35.3. Must furnish the name, address, and telephone number of an emergency contact.
   35.4. Must disclose any special dietary requirements or other restrictions.
36. Money Management. Because participants in the Air Force Tour Program are required to
pay their own expenses, the hosting unit must decide the best way to pay for meals, lodging, and
other included expenses. Priority should be given to making bill payment the least cumbersome
on everyone -- the escorts, the guests, and the payees.
   36.1. All group lodging reservations must be made through the base lodging office. Under
   no circumstances may government credit cards, personal credit cards, or personal checking
   accounts be used to hold group reservations. If only off-base non-contract lodging is
   available, recommend using the fund established for collectively managing guest’s expenses
   be used for any lodging deposit normally associated with commercial hotels.

Section I—Base Tours and Open Houses

37. Base Tour General Guidelines. Tours tell a portion of the Air Force story to visitors and
should be tailored to coincide with the interests of different age groups. An Operational Risk
Management assessment should be done before all interactions with members of the public on
base to ensure safety.
   37.1. Classified Information. Protecting classified information must be a matter of prime
   concern in any tour program.
   37.2. Coordination. Public Affairs must have written procedures, coordinated with base
   security forces, on how to handle all types of occurrences.
   37.3. Foreign Nationals. They may be given the standard community relations base tours
   provided to U.S. citizens. All such requests, at a minimum, should be coordinated through
   the MAJCOM foreign disclosure office. The request should include the name of each visitor,
   country of origin, and proposed tour agenda. In no case should a commitment be made or
   implied until approval is received.
   37.4. Non-PA sponsored tours. Unit commanders may sponsor visitors into their
   organization and onto installations IAW local access procedures. In approving such tours,
   commanders assume responsibility for the safety and security of visitors to include providing
AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010                                                                      27


   escort/supervision of guests, performing risk assessment on activities, properly coordinating
   activities that fall outside the commanders' immediate span of control (i.e., anything outside
   his organization), and adhering to the local installation tour procedures..
38. Base Open House General Guidelines. Open houses provide an opportunity for citizens to
gain an understanding of Air Force missions and military capabilities as well as the skills and
professionalism of its people. Commanders are encouraged to execute an open house with
prudent oversight that balances the issues of force protection and operations tempo with the
expected benefits of opening the base to the public. Additional guidance and a public affairs
open house checklist may be found on the AF PA CoP.
   38.1. Open Houses should not be (or convey the image of) a fair, carnival, circus, civilian air
   show, or display commercial products and should inspire patriotism and aid in military
   recruiting.
   38.2. Open Houses should highlight the base mission and Air Force life and do not always
   have to be an air show. Commanders may consider opening dining facilities, dormitories,
   maintenance shops, classrooms, flight simulators, and other unclassified facilities during a
   non-aviation-related Open House.
   38.3. Commanders should hold Open Houses when considered in the best interest of their
   overall community relations programs.
   38.4. A base Open House can be a major activity. Project officers should be senior in rank
   and familiar with flight and maintenance activities to ensure the success of the event.
   38.5. Due to extensive PA involvement, the Public Affairs officer should not be appointed
   overall Open House project officer. The PA office must work closely with the project officer
   to ensure public awareness and attendance at the Open House.
   38.6. Refer to AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility, for restrictions on
   commercial sponsorship and the use of non-appropriated funds in support of Open Houses.

Section J—-Request for Information (Non-media)

39. General Guidelines. Responding promptly, accurately, and completely to requests for
information or complaints is an important part of Public Affairs. People often develop lasting
impressions of the Air Force and the professionalism of its members based on the quality and
timeliness of replies they receive. Many times correspondence is the only direct contact a person
or organization has with the Air Force.
   39.1. Responses should be written in a clear, concise style.        Avoid Air Force jargon,
   technical language, and acronyms.
   39.2. Whenever possible, current, previously cleared information should be used in
   responding. However, when requests require more detail or involve sensitive subjects,
   proper coordination is essential.
   39.3. When appropriate, refer requesters to AF Link or the installation home page.
   39.4. The SAF/PAY outreach website (www.afoutreach.af.mil) and the AFPC Contact
   Center (http://ask.afpc.randolph.af.mil/contact/) have extensive FAQ sections.
 28                                                             AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010


   39.5. SAF/PAY provides congratulatory letters and certificates signed by the SECAF and
   CSAF to Boy Scout Eagle Award and Girl Scout Gold Award recipients. Requestors need to
   submit      information      through     the    online       submission     form    at:
   https://secure.airforce.com/scouts/index.php.
40. Public Inquiries.
   40.1. A positive attitude toward the Air Force should be developed or reinforced in the
   minds of young people who request information. Send any letters indicating the writer is
   interested in joining the Air Force to U.S. Air Force Recruiting Service, Randolph AFB, TX
   78150-5421.
   40.2. Public Affairs is not expected to invest excessive time and resources to research and
   develop materials for student research papers. Provide materials you have readily available,
   politely advise requesters their request goes beyond your research capability and refer them
   for further information to other appropriate sources of information, such as specific
   magazines, books, public or university libraries, industry, or other Air Force units.
41. Congressional Requests and Inquiries. Handle according to AFI 90-401, Air Force
Relations with Congress.
42. Regional, State, and Local Government Officials and Special Interest Group
Requests. Special care must be taken to get a fully coordinated staff response and concurrence
by the commander, and higher headquarters when appropriate, before answering these requests.
43. Foreign Nationals. Public Affairs must respond directly to all routine foreign national
requests for unclassified information approved for public release. All other requests should be
sent to the local Office of Special Investigations (OSI) detachment and to the MAJCOM foreign
disclosure offices for release determination. If release determination cannot be made at
MAJCOM level, the request will be sent to SAF/IA.

Section K—-Community Participation

44. Guidelines. Air Force policy is to maintain close working relationships with its civilian
neighbors. Such a partnership should include every area of Air Force and civilian community
life. The base and its appropriate officers, senior non-commissioned officers (NCOs), and
civilian employee leadership are encouraged and expected to take part in community programs
and organizations.
   44.1. Local Organizations. Base personnel should be encouraged to join local organizations
   compatible with their interests.
   44.2. Public Affairs should maintain an organizational reference file to include titles and
   addresses, official missions and structure, places and scheduled meetings, and conventions.
   44.3. The commander or a designated representative should be ex-officio observers who
   regularly attend meetings of key civic organizations representing a broad cross section of the
   community, such as the Chamber of Commerce.                  The commander or designated
   representative should consult the servicing legal office regarding the limits imposed by the
   Joint Ethics Regulation, Sections 3-200 and 3-201, on attendance at and membership in non-
   Federal entities in one’s official capacity and for ethics advice on activity limits, especially
   during fundraisers.
AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010                                                                      29


45. Commander and Public Affairs Responsibilities.
   45.1. Civic Leaders, Community Partners, Honorary Commanders and Advisory Groups.
   Personal contact must be established with local civic leaders to increase public awareness
   and understanding of the armed forces and the mission, policies and programs of the Air
   Force, and to build relationships with members of the local community and encourage them
   to share the Air Force story.
      45.1.1. Installation personnel will only ask participants in community leadership
      programs for their personal or individual observations or recommendations. In order to
      avoid triggering the Federal Advisory Committee Act, these groups will not be asked by
      the Air Force for group or consensus recommendations.
   45.2. Honorary Commanders Programs
      45.2.1. Personal data must be labeled and stored in accordance with the requirements of
      the Privacy Act of 1974 and related Air Force records management procedures. Units
      must ensure the privacy of personal data maintained on individuals for the purpose of
      interacting with the public and its representatives selected for routine contact. Units will
      ensure access to such personal data is not disclosed beyond the original intent of its
      collection without the individual’s permission.
      45.2.2. Key civic leaders or groups should be invited to the base for informational
      briefings and meetings hosted by the commander and staff, to include honorary
      commanders, as applicable. Commanders must ensure that these individuals or groups
      will not be given preferential treatment that implies or confers authority or access to base
      services they would not be otherwise be entitled to. Commanders and public affairs
      offices should be made aware of any misuse of commander granted access to the base, to
      include use of services meant exclusively for Airmen, their families and DoD employees.
      In the event command considers rescinding base access or privileges afforded to a key
      civic leader or group, to include honorary commanders, maintaining base security is the
      paramount factor to be considered along with the potential impact on community ties
      and/or local factors.
          45.2.2.1. Base access for civic leaders/honorary commanders is an installation
          commander’s decision and should be worked in accordance with AFI 34-272 and
          local security forces offices
      45.2.3. Both appropriated and non-appropriated funds are generally not available to fund
      honorary commander programs. Base events for civic leaders, such as luncheons, should
      be “pay as you go” or funded with official representation funds (ORF) in accordance with
      AFI 65-603. This type of event should be held only once yearly at locations within the
      U.S. and its territories. Outside the U.S. and its territories, the once yearly and “pay as
      you go” limitations do not apply where the ORF approving official determines that such
      practices would be detrimental to international relations. ORF may be used to host
      distinguished foreign nationals in accordance with AFI 65-603. Consult the installation
      legal office before making plans.
      45.2.4. Guidelines for event participation and gifts apply to honorary commander and
      advisory group programs. Event participation cannot violate DOD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics
30                                                           AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010


     Regulation. Avoid anything that could be perceived as impermissible preferential
     treatment, fraud, waste or abuse.
     45.2.5. The responsible PA organization should develop an operating instruction (OI) in
     accordance with AFI 33-360 to implement the honorary commanders program within
     resources available at the installation. The OI should outline responsibilities of various
     organizations on base (protocol, security forces, services, etc.) and supplement this AFI.
     45.2.6. When practical, term limits should generally be no more than two years to three
     years to enhance the program’s reach and effectiveness and to avoid program stagnation.
     If the commanders deem longer terms are necessary, extreme care should be taken to
     avoid the perception that civic leader representation is a closed or stagnant group. If
     requested, a current honorary commander may terminate his or her term early. Should an
     honorary commander not fulfill his or her responsibilities (e.g., recurring non-
     participation) the installation commander may terminate his or her term early.

            45.2.6.1.8. DELETED
  45.3. Choosing honorary commanders.
     45.3.1. The intent of an honorary commanders program is to educate and increase the
     knowledge and understanding of key civic leaders about the Air Force and the
     installation. Civilian participants will be selected from among non-federal elected or
     appointed officials, mayors, chamber of commerce-type group members, principals of
     local schools, Military Affairs Committee members and others who, because of their
     position or influence in the community, can positively impact public support for the base.
     Public Affairs offices should nominate honorary commanders from a cross-section of the
     entire community, and nominees will be selected by wing leaders.
     45.3.2. Nominees should not be an immediate relative (spouse, child, parent, sibling) of a
     current or former Honorary Commander unless they are bona fide civic leaders in their
     own right. However, relatives should not serve concurrently as honorary commanders. .
     45.3.3. Nominees should not be military retirees because the program aims at orienting
     community members with limited knowledge of today’s military.
     45.3.4. Selection of honorary commanders should target engagement of a broad cross-
     section of area community leaders. To that end, command should minimize the number
     and overlap of participants from a particular group or organization in any given year.
AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010                                                                        31


       Where possible a single representative to the program is desirable (for example, from a
       school or business), taking into account the fact that heavily engaged civic leaders may
       be members of or participate in multiple local groups or organizations.
       45.3.5. Nominees can work in a media-related field, but cannot be a newspaper, TV, or
       radio reporter due to the inherent conflicts of interest that would arise for them if allowed
       unescorted access to the installation and/or access to base leadership in situations not
       intended to be public or to be publicized.
       45.3.6. Nominees will not be members of Congress or their staffs.
       45.3.7. Individuals employed by DOD contractors will not be nominated, nor may
       nominees otherwise occupy a position that may create a perception of a conflict of
       interest between program participation and their private interests, for example holding
       financial interests in DOD contractors that would create such a perception. The local
       legal office should be contacted for assistance in addressing questions in this regard.
       45.3.8. Nominees will not include any federally elected or appointed officials. Nominees
       should not include anyone whose membership would cast a negative light on the U.S. Air
       Force. Locally elected or appointed officials can be considered on a case-by-case basis.
   45.4. National Organizations: Except for the NCR, local commanders may deal directly
   with local and regional chapters of national organizations. Send questions about liaison and
   cooperation with local organizations through PA channels to SAF/PAY. OASD/PA serves as
   the principal point of contact for all national organizations (including their local and regional
   chapters in the NCR) on all matters except:
       45.4.1. Requests for information from an organization that bears directly on the Air
       Force.
       45.4.2. Requests for Air Force Speakers
       45.4.3. Those matters involving contractual or consulting relationships.
       45.4.4. Matters pertaining to scientific and technical information.          Scientific and
       technical services are administered by the Defense Logistics Agency.
46. Joint Councils. When there is more than one military installation in an area, community
relations efforts or programs should be coordinated when appropriate. Consideration should be
given to either forming a joint community council or providing for representation on the separate
councils.
47. Inter-Service Support for Events. Some community relations programs involve support
from more than one military service. When more than one military service supports a program
sponsored by a civilian organization and the magnitude of the support warrants DOD
coordination, OASD/PA requests one military department to nominate an officer located in the
area of the program to serve as the coordinator of DOD support.
   47.1. When the Air Force is requested to nominate a DOD coordinator, SAF/PA requests the
   command with the installation closest to the event to nominate an officer. OASD/PA then
   designates the officer as the DOD coordinator. The DOD coordinator is responsible for
   coordinating all military support, including support by Air National Guard and Air Force
   Reserve. DOD coordinators are authorized direct liaison with OASD/PA.
 32                                                              AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010


   47.2. When the Air Force provides support for a particular program, SAF/PA requests
   appointment of a project officer, usually located within the area of the event, to represent the
   Air Force and assist the DOD coordinator.
   47.3. The DOD coordinator prepares an after-action report and sends it to OASD/PA within
   30 days following the program. Air Force project officers assist the DOD coordinator in
   preparing the after-action report by supplying the Air Force information. A copy of the
   report must be sent to SAF/PAY.
48. Presidential Wreath Laying Ceremonies.
   48.1. The Office of the Military Assistant to the President provides the Presidential wreaths
   and arranges for their annual placement at the tombs, burial sites, and monuments of all
   former presidents. The Air Force, through the MAJCOM or FOA indicated, provides
   Presidential representatives at wreath laying ceremonies for the following Presidents: Millard
   Fillmore (ANG), 7 January, at Buffalo, New York, and Lyndon B. Johnson (ANG), 27
   August, at LBJ Ranch, Texas.
   48.2. The minimum military grade for wreath laying ceremonies is a Colonel from the
   installation closest to the site, unless overriding considerations preclude the availability of a
   senior officer. The name, grade, title, address, and telephone number of each designated
   representative must be sent to SAF/PAY at least 65 days in advance of the month of wreath
   placement.
   48.3. SAF/PAY must give the names of Presidential representatives to the Special Assistant
   to the Secretary of Defense for forwarding to the Military Assistant to the President, who
   arranges final details of the ceremony.
49. Observances.
   49.1. Armed Forces Day. By Presidential Proclamation, Armed Forces Day is observed on
   the third Saturday of May. On Armed Forces Day, in keeping with the spirit of unification in
   the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, Air Force units must not observe an
   anniversary (or any other day of significance to the Air Force and its subordinate elements) at
   any location away from an Air Force base without specific authorization of OASD/PA.
      49.1.1. OASD/PA coordinates Armed Forces Programs at the national level. SAF/PA
      will pass OASD/PA guidelines to the field for each year's observance.
      49.1.2. Air Force activities will participate by extending hospitality to the public through
      open houses or similar events and by cooperating with community and organizational
      observances of Armed Forces Day as appropriate. In locations and situations where two
      or more military services are represented, joint participation in community-sponsored
      programs is encouraged.
   49.2. Veterans Day Observances. The Administrator of Veterans Affairs is usually
   designated by Presidential Proclamation as the Chairperson of the Veterans Day National
   Committee. The objective of this committee, comprised of representatives from major
   veteran’s organizations, is to stimulate and perpetuate national public interest in honoring all
   veterans of all wars on Veterans Day. Each year, this Committee designates certain
   communities as regional sites for observing this national holiday. DOD supports these
   observances by appointing a coordinator and approving military support. Regional sites are
AFI35-105 26 JANUARY 2010                                                                       33


   designated to make sure proper priority and an appropriate level of support are available for
   these major observances. DOD policy is to provide military support for Veterans Day
   observances in communities designated as regional sites as well as for smaller local
   observances held in communities not so designated.
50. Record Keeping. MAJCOMs and FOAs keep SAF/PA advised of significant community
relations programs, problems, and needs. Public Affairs will maintain records of community
