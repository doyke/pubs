This instruction implements Technical Order 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting,
Investigation and Resolution. It outlines procedures and assigns responsibilities, as well as
standardizes the deficiency reporting, investigating, and resolution process, as practicable, for
Tinker Air Force Base. It does not apply to Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard. Should
organizations covered by the scope of this instruction determine further refinement of procedures
and responsibilities are required beyond those contained in this instruction, development of a
lower level instruction is recommended. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility using AFIMT 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication. Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims This instruction may not be supplemented.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This operating instruction has been substantially revised and requires a complete review.
This revision reflects the most recent changes contained in TO 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency
Reporting, Investigation and Resolution; and revised AFMCI 63-510, Deficiency Reporting,
Investigation and Resolution. This revision implements the use of the Joint Deficiency
Reporting System (JDRS) replacing Infocen, GO21. JDRS is a cross-service web enabled
automated tracking system designed to initiate process and track deficiency reports from the war
fighter to the investigating process solution. JDRS implements specific tasking for the different
type of user from the originating point, action points and support point tracking. Role–specific
training must be accomplished prior to requesting a JDRS account. The required computer

training course work is accessible from https://afkm.wpf.af.mil/drir.training. Access is
approved on a need to know basis, once approved, JDRS users are required to authenticate using
the common access card (CAC), and users without a CAC require PKI certification from one of
the DOD approved external authorities.

NOTE: All hard copies of Tinker Air Force Base (TAFB) instructions are considered
uncontrolled copies. Only the electronic version residing on the Tinker Air Force Base web
pages will be considered controlled. When a copy of a TAFB instruction is utilized, it is the
user‘s responsibility to verify that copy is the most current available. This will be accomplished
by comparing the date of the copy with the date of the electronic version on the web page.

Scope. This instruction applies to all Tinker Air Force Base personnel and contractors who
operate or sustain the USAF Deficiency Reporting and Investigating System (DRIS). The
intended scope of this instruction is that information contained herein will be used as a
supplement and is not intended to supersede any guidance provided by TO 00-35D-54. This
instruction applies to organizations that are responsible for deficiency process functions to
include any agency or contractor who performs exhibit handling and processing responsibilities
for USAF managed or repaired "Q" condition assets. The instruction outlines and assigns
responsibility for the deficiency process, exhibit shipping and handling procedures, as well as
coordinating specific efforts between this ALC and other identified agencies. Although on-base
organizations are structured differently, every effort has been made to standardize deficiency
process procedures.

     1.2.10. Accomplishes transfer and/or reassignment of misrouted DRs to the responsible file/
     database/action point.
1.3. Deficiency Process Metrics. The SPOCO is responsible to assess the health of the DRIS
program through deficiency process performance metrics by measuring the DR process through
analysis and comparison to program goals, standards, objectives and trending results. The
SPOCO will:
     1.3.1. Extract monthly and quarterly DR statistics from JDRS, with a breakdown of DR open
     status by applicable organization to identify specific DRs which exceed the AFMC standard.
     1.3.2. Segregate "open" DRs where final resolution has been determined and is dependent
     upon other factors which preclude closing. Information regarding use of these category
     codes, along with their subsequent processing and status update requirements, is contained in
     Chapter 4 of TO 00-35D-54. These DRs are in one of the following status codes:
        1.3.2.1. Open Awaiting Engineering Change Proposal (ECP).
        1.3.2.2. Open Awaiting Funds (AF)
        1.3.2.3. Open Awaiting Fix Verification (AFV)
        1.3.2.4. Open Repeated (R)
        1.3.2.5. Open Dispute (DISP)
NOTE If an open DR has not been actively investigated within 12 months of the initial
deficiency reporting, the reason for delayed actions or not funding the investigation shall be
noted in JDRS and the DR closed with the status of ―    Closed-Acceptable Risk‖. The risk
associated with that DR must be formally accepted by the individual in the chain of command
with the authority to accept a risk at that level. Ref TO 00-35D-54 sect. 1.7.7.
     1.3.3. Provide a review of DR progress towards resolution and distribute group-level DR
     data monthly to cognizant groups and center deficiency process POCs. This review provides
     an aggregate metric roll-up each quarter to OC-ALC/CC as part of management review
     indicators. Metrics that do not meet recommended TO 00-35D-54 standards require
     corrective action plans from the responsible organization.
1.4. Management Indicators. Management indicators developed by the SPOCO provide a
standardized method to identify, resolve and prevent stagnation of processes which impede
deficiency resolution and opportunities for improvement. Management indicators include and
will be supplemented with other metrics deemed appropriate for assessing the health of the
center deficiency process.
     1.4.1. All open status Category (CAT) I and CAT II DRs where resolution of described
     deficiency has not been determined.
     1.4.2. Exhibit process and handling process timeliness is a measure of AF and DLA-
     managed assets for which OC-ALC has reporting responsibilities and engineering authority.

   1.4.3. Monthly memoranda is provided to cognizant groups and contain additional metrics,
   tables and supporting spreadsheets for all "open investigation in work" DRs regardless of
   status or determined resolution.
NOTE: To portray the most accurate metrics and ensure consistency in reporting, monthly edit
assessments are performed through queries to identify records with incomplete or inaccurate
data. Errors and missing edits identified are forwarded via e-mail for action points/ESs to correct
and update. DRs should be accepted or rejected within ten days. DRs that languish for over ten
days without being acknowledged or rejected by the action point may be added to the monthly
management indicators.
1.5. File Manager Responsibilities. The SPOCO is the local manager for JDRS.                    Its
operational responsibilities include:
   1.5.1. Control JDRS access to include civilian/military support and prime contractors.
   1.5.2. Determine JDRS access authorization based on individual deficiency process
   responsibility area.
   1.5.3. Prior to providing access, the SPOCO ensures users complete their specific deficiency
   process operational training and become familiar with resources on the deficiency process
   community                                    of                                     practice.

                       INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT

8.1. Computer and Information Technology (IT) support.
   8.1.1. The DR process requires support from various operating systems: JDRS help desk,
   DO43 and e-mail, via local servers. The reliance of processing on these systems is such that
   computer support is integral to this instruction. This chapter provides instructions regarding
   specific sources of remedy for difficulties encountered.
   8.1.2. JDRS. The SPOCO office is JDRS administrator for OC-ALC. When a problem is
   identified as a responsibility of HQ AFMC JDRS Clearinghouse administrator, the OC-ALC
   administrator will notify them of the problem or will ask the action point to do so. Often,
   specific characteristics of a system problem are better explained "first hand." For problems
   encountered pertaining to the JDRS database, the JDRS help desk at
   DFSG.SBPDRIS@WPAFB.AF.MIL may be contacted and send a copy of the problem to
   the SPOCO for info and tracking purposes.
   8.1.3. For any problem(s) encountered with DO43, action point should contact the DO43
   Help Desk.
   8.1.4. Local Area Network (LAN). All computer related problems, to include LAN access
   and system or application issues, should be reported to the 72 ABW/SCO Help Desk, 734-
   HELP. The 72 ABW/SCO Help Desk will create a Remedy ticket, issue a ticket number, and
   route to the appropriate support area for resolution. The action point should record point of
   contact information including ticket number, date and time it was issued. This information
   will assist the action point in performing follow-up queries if timely resolution to the
   problem has not occurred.

                            DOCUMENT AND DATA CONTROL

9.1. Document and Data Control.
   9.1.1. An integral part of the deficiency reporting process is control of all processed
   documents as set forth by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
   9001:2000 family of international quality management standards and guidelines; Aerospace
   Standard 9100, Quality Management Systems - Aerospace - Requirement; and by TM 90-107,
   OC-ALC Quality Manual, pertaining to written procedures for controlling documents and
   data relating to ISO requirements. This chapter of the instruction addresses disposition of
   other quality records such as hardcopy charts or disk presentations created for management
   review briefings or analyses.
   9.1.2. The Deficiency Reporting System, JDRS, is a data system that retains all DR data.
   The administrator of the JDRS databases controls retention time of DR data files.

Terms
Air Force Deficiency Report archive—An automated system that archives the historical
records for the deficiency reporting process.
Action Point—The action point is the focal point between the support point and the submitting
organization. The action point is responsible for all technical/administrative actions for
resolution of a DR submitted IAW TO 00-35D-54. They evaluate and will initiate a course of
action for DR resolution in coordination with engineering, IMs, ESs and QASs. Action Points
provide status updates, closing actions and exhibit disposition instructions. They maintain active
oversight of assigned DRs, monitor program metrics/trends, monitor program compliance and
advocate improvement within the center and the DRIS (JDRS)
Business Interface Council (BIC)—An automated interface system which performs the
function of transferring electronic information between what are otherwise unrelated or
unconnected databases. It is the means through which data is transferred from DRIS to Product
Data Reporting and Evaluation Program (PDREP), thus facilitating inter-service operations.
Category I Deficiency (CAT I)—A deficiency which may cause death, severe injury or severe
occupational illness; may cause loss or major damage to a weapon system; critically restricts the
combat readiness capabilities of the using organization; or which could result in a production line
stoppage.
Category II Deficiency (CAT II)—A deficiency which may impede or constrain successful
mission accomplishment (system impacts OSS&E, but does not meet the safety or mission
impact criteria of a CAT I deficiency). Category II deficiencies may also include recommended
enhancements that improve or complement successful mission accomplishment, but are not
absolutely required.
SPOCO—In accordance with TO 00-35D-54, each AFMC logistics, product and test center shall
have a single point of contact office (SPOCO) to administer and provide oversight of the center
 26                                                 TINKERAFBI21-109 2 FEBRUARY 2011


DRIS program. The SPOCO ensures standardized center processes to the extent practical and
provides active DRIS oversight. The SPOCO establishes and reviews processes to measure
DRIS JDRS status, timeliness of actions and exhibit handling processes.
Chief/Lead Engineers—Designated system chief/lead engineer, in support of the program
manager, has technical responsibility, accountability and authority for all technical activities
throughout the operations life of the program. They are integral members of DRIS for their
system. They support PM-established DRIS processes, specifically providing technical oversight
and direction for risk mitigation and deficiency resolution. They are responsible for establishing
exhibit investigation criteria to ensure DR investigations provide intended value. They ensure
active oversight and awareness of DRIS status, program metrics/trends, program compliance and
advocate DRIS improvement.
Credit Reversal—Reversal of a credit issued when it is determined the reason for the credit was
invalid or no longer exists. Credit reversals are requested by the applicable action point.
Critical Safety Item (CSI)—A part, subassembly, assembly, subsystem, installation equipment
or support equipment for a system that contains a characteristic, where any failure, malfunction
or absence of which could cause a catastrophic or critical failure resulting in loss of, or serious
damage to, the system or an unacceptable risk of personal injury or loss of life.
Cross—Component Reporting—AFI 21-115, Product Quality Deficiency Report Program,
provides procedures for submission and support of all cross-component reports on government-
owned items. The processes for submitting PQDRs across component lines to another service or
DoD agency/activity are the same as for any other DR for the originator or originating point.
However, the USAF action point will act as the service screening point and shall forward
deficiencies to the appropriate component action point for investigation and resolution.
Deficiency Report (DR)—The generic term used within the AF to record, submit and transmit
deficiency data which may include, but is not limited to, a DR involving quality, material,
software, warranty or informational deficiency data submitted using the SF 368 or equivalent
format.
Joint Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS)—provides a common, seamless solution for
deficiency reporting and resolution management across the Aeronautical Enterprise. JDRS is a
cross-service web enabled automated tracking system designed to initiate, process and track
deficiency reports from the war-fighter through the investigation process, and is managed in
conjunction with the Navy at HQ AFMC. Users may query the database via a web-browser
interface.            Refer       to     the      Deficiency       Reporting      Homepage,
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=HE-NP-M0-01 to establish a
DRIS account and for more in-depth information on database processes (manuals, procedures,
tools, forms, etc.).

Government Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP)—The relationship between GIDEP
and the DRIS is overlapping. The GIDEP is a government-wide system for exchanging technical
information between agencies and supporting contractors about nonconforming products. The
GIDEP is the designated repository for discontinued product notices and obsolescence
management information for the DoD.
Materiel Deficiency Report (MDR)—This type of deficiency report is used to report an
unacceptable condition, such as a component/item failure; or to recommend an enhancement that
impacts the OSS&E of a system, subsystem or component. It may include aging system issues
or trends, improvement recommendations or request for investigation to determine the root cause
or condition that induced the failure. An MDR may be submitted with or without an exhibit and
may include trending observations made and/or recommendations for inclusion as an agenda
item in improvement working groups or forums.
Materiel Improvement Project (MIP)—A MIP is a planned effort to investigate and resolve
deficiencies, adverse trends or to evaluate proposed improvements or enhancements. A MIP
may be established whenever a deficiency, improvement or enhancement is determined to
warrant further investigation or consideration and is used to monitor and control actions related
to it. MIPs are assigned and tracked by an ALC.
Mishap Deficiency Reports (MHAP)—In accordance with TO 00-35D-54, Chapter 3, these are
material or quality deficiencies that have been identified as having high accident potential or that
are a known/suspected causes of an AF mishap. In all cases, these reports are in support of
safety reports and investigations conducted in accordance with AFI 91-204 and shall include
coordination with the safety office, identify the safety investigating officer's contact information
and reference the associated mishap number.
Nuclear Weapons—Related Materiel Management (NWRM)—Is a newly defined materiel
category; refer to terms and definitions for detailed description. The guidance and procedures
prescribed in AFI 20-110 apply to all nuclear sustainment activities directly or indirectly
involved in NWRM management. This includes Air Force supply (base, depot), transportation,
maintenance (base, depot contract/organic), munitions, depot storage, disposal, demilitarization,
and anywhere NWRM is managed, located, stored, used, etc. The successful application of these
procedures requires the full cooperation of all personnel associated with the storage, shipping,
transshipping and receiving of all hazardous/non-hazardous and classified/unclassified NWRM
assets.
Originator—The originator may be any individual who identifies conditions which limit or
restrict an item or system from fulfilling its intended purpose. The originator discovers the
deficiency, identifies its impact and initiates reporting and exhibit processes as established within
their organization.
Originating Point—The originating point is a function typically located within the
organization‘s quality, safety or resource management office; and has overall DR program
management responsibility for the submitting organization. Responsibilities include promoting
the DR program to ensure knowledge of criteria and processes; interacting with originators to
ensure the DR is valid, accurate and complete; validating the deficiency category; ensuring
applicable exhibits are available, secured and properly identified; submitting the validated report
through Deficiency Report Entry Data Entry and Mail Submitter (DREAMS) to the DRIS

database; tracking DR progress and resolution, and performing trend analysis and providing
feedback.
Product Data Reporting and Evaluation Program (PDREP)—This is an automated
information system designed to track quality and delivery performance on material/services
procured by the Navy. Data is collected from all Naval Systems Commands on a daily basis.
The application offers a wide selection of standard management and graphic reports. In addition,
a powerful ad-hoc feature allows users to design their own reports. It has been authorized and
accepted for use as a common database for the transmission and processing of DRs between
component services in conjunction with the BIC, by the AF, DLA, DCMA and other cross-
component agencies.
Product Quality Deficiency Report (PQDR)—These are reports of deficiency resulting from
an initial failure, defect or nonconforming condition discovered on a new, newly repaired or
overhauled product when that product is placed in service. Product quality deficiency reports
include the reporting of failures that occur on contractually prescribed warranted items within the
warranty period. These may also include failures that result after the item was placed in service
that are suspected as latent defects or quality escapes resulting from poor workmanship,
nonconformance to applicable specifications, drawings, standards, processes or other technical
requirements.
Program Manager (PM)—The system or program manager is responsible for implementing the
JDRS IAW TO 00-35D-54, Chapter 1, and maintaining consistency with the preservation of
OSS&E baselines. They ensure active oversight and awareness of JDRS status. They are
responsible for maintaining visibility of DRs reported against their system, regardless of where
the DR is assigned for resolution. They manage program metrics/trends, program compliance
and advocate DRIS improvement. The PM has final authority, through coordination with the
originating organization, on the final report category determination.
Screening Point—The screening point is the receiving activity designated as focal point for the
receipt and processing of DRs. These duties may be performed in whole or in part by the
SPOCO at each AFMC logistics center or delegated to meet the needs of a center‘s DR program.
Software Deficiency Report (SWDR)—A report of deficiency submitted against any C41
software or automated data systems. This may include, but is not limited to, deficiencies on
Operational Flight Programs, Mission Information Systems, Automated Information Systems
and supporting software.
NOTE—: JDRS does not allow submitting SWDRs but may be submitted as PQDRs and
identified on the description field.
Support Point—The activity which, upon request, assists the action point by conducting
investigations, trend analyses and provides recommendations for corrective and preventive
actions. They maintain active oversight of assigned DRs, monitor program metrics/trends and
advocate improvement within their activity and JDRS.
