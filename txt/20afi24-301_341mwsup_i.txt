3. Vehicle Operator Responsibilities Within the Missile Field Complex.
   3.1. In vehicles with limited visibility (e.g., tractor trailer type vehicles, HUMVEEs, M-
   vans, S-vans, etc.), operators will use spotters when backing or negotiating tight turns. When
   a non limited visibility vehicle has a lone operator and no spotter is available, the vehicle
   operator will perform a vehicle walk around to identify hazards prior to backing.
   3.2. All Payload Transporter, Transporter Erector, Missile Transporter or Periodic
   Maintenance Team vans will be parked in approved parking areas or on pads. Pads/approved
   parking areas will allow a separation of 10 feet from edge to edge between any portion of the
   parked vehicles, except during booster roll transfer procedures. Secured (i.e. fenced-in)
   parking is the primary option and should only be deviated from in limited instances.
   3.3. All 2M0XX tractor/trailer operators will use approved Twentieth Air Force checklists to
   prepare and operate a tractor trailer.
   3.4. All trips traveling to/from/within the missile complex must contact TCC prior to their
   departure and upon arrival at their destination. Conduct trips in support of Treaty
   Compliance Inspections IAW appropriate Treaty Annexes.

     3.5. (341MW) For the 341 MW, use the control center identified in paragraphs 3.4. - 3.4.2.
        3.5.1. At a minimum, trips will provide TCC with trip number/call sign, registration
        number, number of personnel, destination, travel route, estimated arrival time, and any
        authorized stops.
            3.5.1.1. (Added-341MW) Trip cards. A 341 MW Form 133, Transportation
            Control Center Trip Card, with a valid trip number is required to be supplied to
            appropriate work center as identified in paragraph 2.1.2 for off-base trips. Keys and
            Codes Control Center (KCCC) will require a trip number for any dispatch to a missile
            alert facility or launch facility. 341 MW 133 is available on the Air Force e-
            publishing pubs and forms website. Other paper or electronic documents/rosters may
            be used in place of the 341 MW 133, but only with prior approval from TCC (MMOC
            for MXG teams and MSC for SFG teams).
            3.5.1.2. (Added-341MW) Trip Numbers. The following trip numbers are assigned
            to 341 MW units. These numbers are permanently assigned and will be preceded by

     3.6. Primary and secondary routes are the authorized routes of travel for government motor
     vehicles.
        3.6.1. All trips will use only approved routes of travel to their destination unless the
        appropriate authority validates a deviation. Obtain authorization prior to trip departure,
20AFI24-301_341MWSUP_I 14 MAY 2013                                                              5


      when possible.     Any additional deviations require approval from the appropriate
      authority.
      3.6.2. Security Force response teams responding to a real world Covered Wagon,
      Helping Hand, In-Field Response, Back-up Force or emergency situation involving
      possible loss of life or limb may use other routes of travel. In these cases, security force
      response teams are authorized to use any maintained township, county, state or federal
      roadway. Security Forces units will conduct familiarization training for these seldom-
      used routes upon squadron commander approval.
      3.6.3. Missile field maintenance personnel will inform TCC when vehicles must travel
      on other than primary and/or secondary routes to accomplish repairs and inspections on
      their equipment.

          personnel are unable to contact TCC.
   3.7. Each wing will develop and maintain a missile complex folder for each missile complex
   vehicle.
      3.7.1. The folder will identify directions to each LF and MAF from home base. The
      directions will clearly indicate primary routes (route certified and paid for by Defense
      Access Roads funds…vehicles over 20,000 pounds GVWR) and secondary/alternate
      routes (all other routes approved for use within the missile complexes), as well as road
      surfaces (paved, gravel, unpaved).
      3.7.2. Roads other than primary and secondary routes, which may be used by SF
      response teams, will have road hazards (blind corners, sharp bends, railroad crossings,
      etc.) clearly indicated.
   3.8. Private motor vehicle (PMV) travel is limited to approved tours and for extreme
   emergencies with approval. Individuals will not conduct PMV travel to the missile complex
   for mission-related reasons without appropriate group commander approval. Follow all pre-
   dispatch requirements when PMV travel in the missile complex is necessary to fulfill mission
   needs.
   3.9. Short, periodic non-duty related rest stops are authorized as determined locally, when
   not prohibited by instructions or threat conditions. Notify TCC prior to stopping and upon
   travel continuation, for stops exceeding 10 minutes.
4. Travel Conditions (TC).
   4.1. Road probes are used when road conditions for safe travel are questionable. After
   verifying current road conditions through TCC, weather services and individual state road
   condition reports, it may be necessary to probe a road to determine if it meets the parameters
   for safe travel. Road probes will be conducted by highly experienced, supervisory personnel
   and only after proper risk assessment has been accomplished and is authorized.
   4.2. Consult and adhere to the TC in Attachment 1. The chart defines TC and the criteria
   used to classify travel conditions as GREEN, YELLOW, or RED. (Vehicle operators should
   only report observed conditions, not designate a specific TC.)
 6                                                   20AFI24-301_341MWSUP_I 14 MAY 2013


     4.3. IAW appropriate security guidance, security forces must provide immediate response to
     all alarm situations. Security forces must exhaust all attempts to respond prior to declaring
     all or parts of a site(s) as not accessible.
        4.3.1. TCC permission is not required for security forces response to alarm situations
        regardless of road/weather conditions. However, the Flight Security Controller (FSC) or
        Missile Security Control (MSC) will contact TCC as soon as possible to obtain road
        condition information and departure information.
        4.3.2. Each unit will ensure a process is in place so that SF flight leadership and TCC are
        notified of responses to alarm conditions. All other movements will be IAW this
        instruction.
     4.4. For visiting teams, the team chief/senior individual is dispatch authority for team
     members for missile complex travel in TC GREEN/YELLOW. For TC RED, dispatch
     authority, is provided in conjunction with the wing commander.
     4.4. (341MW) For 341 MW, authorization to travel in TC Red for visiting teams can be
     delegated to a designated representative by the Wg/CC (e.g. hosting Gp/CC).
