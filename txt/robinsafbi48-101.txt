                                          Chapter 3

                                  PROGRAM ELEMENTS

3.1. TLD Monitoring. Refer to Section 2.3 for BE specific responsibilities.
   3.1.1. Organizations presently on the TLD program are shown in Attachment 2. Also listed
   are investigation action levels, as required by AFMAN 48-125. The NDI shops follow TO
   33B-1-1, which requires BE to perform annual scatter radiation surveys. The unshielded
   NDI is required to perform their duties during minimum-occupancy times, which typically
   entails the night-owl shift.
   3.1.2. "The 116th BE TLD manager handles the distribution and shipping of the 116th Shops
   listed in Attachment 2. The 116th BE is required to provide a copy of the TLD reports to
   the IRSO in the 78th BE office, who is the sole individual that can sign on the forms."
3.2. Generally Licensed Devices (GLDs).
   3.2.1. Acquisition and management of GLDs is outlined in AFI 40-201 Attachment 3, which
   includes but is not limited to:
       3.2.1.1. Organizations owning GLDs shall provide the IRSO an updated inventory every
       six months so that the IRSO can input the data into the Radioactive Materials
       Management Information System (RAMMIS).
       3.2.1.2. Radiation leakage testing IAW manufacturer instruction or Sealed Source
       Device Registry (SSDR). All leak tests will be coordinated with the IRSO so that
       appropriate protocols and materials are used. SSDRs may be obtained from the RIC
       through the IRSO.
   3.2.2. While not considered GLDs, organizations possessing radiation check sources shall
   provide the IRSO an updated inventory every six months.
3.3. Overexposures Investigations. Refer to AFI 48-148 and AFMAN 48-125.
3.4. Radioactive Material Disposition.
   3.4.1. Transfer of licensed/permitted RAM may only be carried out by transferring to
   another licensed agency or to a licensed disposal contractor.
   3.4.2. Disposal of RAM (radioactive waste, obsolete RAM-containing devices, etc.) is the
   responsibility of the using organization.
   3.4.3. All RAM transfers and/or disposals must be coordinated with the IRSO.
   3.4.4. The IRSO will contact the Air Force Radiological Recycling and Disposition
   (AFRRAD) for coordination.
3.5. Management of RAFB RAM Permits. Refer to Attachment 5.
3.6. Non-USAF Licenses on RAFB. Refer to Attachment 6.
3.7. Museum of Aviation.
   3.7.1. POC: Tony Faircloth (DSN 472-7579)
ROBINSAFBI48-101 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                            13


   3.7.2. The museum has nearly 100 aircraft, most of which require radiation swipe surveys
   IAW AFI 84-103. Overall, the museum also has over 6,000 radioactive items ranging from
   Ra-226 dials inside aircraft cockpits to artifacts donated by patrons and stored across the
   separate museum facilities. According to AFI 40-201, any one location that contains more
   than 100 Ra-226 items is supposed to have a license. Due to some developing AFMC
   Heritage Program initiatives, the RIC has said they will remain neutral, neither forcing nor
   preventing the museum from obtaining a license. Due to the difficult and lengthy process of
   training (which the RIC mandates requires the Non-Template Permit RSO course) it is likely
   BE will remain the RSO. However, the number of radioactive items in the museum’s
   inventory should be reduced.
3.8. RAM Burial Grounds.
   3.8.1. Two separate disposal areas existed on RAFB and were both removed in 1993. The
   sites were defined as RW-15 and WP-12. RW-15 was created in 1954 and WP-12 was
   created in 1975-1976. Site RW-15 contained one 20 ft x 20 ft x 15 ft vault of reinforced
   concrete that contained radioactive commodities. Prior site analysis identified possible
   radioactive soil contamination adjacent to the vault. There was no evidence of hazardous
   material contamination in the soils. Site WP-12 contained three concrete cylindrical vaults
   approximately 30 inches in diameter. Two of these cylindrical containers contained
   hazardous materials and the third contained radioactive commodities including radium dials
   and gauges. Further information may be found in the “Warner-Robins Air Force Base,
   Georgia Disposal Sites RW-15 & WP-12 Exhumations Operations Plan” at Bldg 207 BE
   office.
3.9. Radon on RAFB.
   3.9.1. RAFB is listed as a low risk installation for radon in facilities according to
   USAFOEHL Report 87-132RZ0111KRD dated October 1987. Therefore, radon air
   monitoring within buildings is not required.
   3.9.2. Well 19 was closed after high radon concentrations were discovered.

             BASIC RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL SHIPPING PROCEDURES

A4.1. Each receiving or shipping agency must have a separate, marked, and locked enclosure for
the receipt, handling, or shipment of radioactive packages. This separate area is to ensure
personnel not familiar with the proper handling or radioactive materials are not accidentally
exposed to ionizing radiation. This location must be coordinated with the IRSO.
A4.2. All radioactive materials that are covered by a license or permit must be accounted for by
a radioactive materials transfer receipt, which is separate from any contractual, security, or other
receipt documents. Contract shipping and receiving agencies should obtain transfer receipts
when items are dispensed to RAFB organizations.
A4.3. When radioactive material is received at, or is to be shipped from RAFB; the IRSO must
be contacted by the receiving or shipping agency. The IRSO or designated representative will
monitor the container. If the receiving or shipping agency is a contractor, the contractor is not
required to notify the IRSO. The contractor must perform all labeling, packaging, and monitoring
requirements outlined in 10 CFR and 49 CFR. NOTE: In accordance with 10 CFR 20.1906, all
packages labeled with a Radioactive White I, Yellow II, or Yellow III, as specified DOT
regulations (49 CFR 172.403 and 172.436-440), must be monitored as soon as possible but not
later than 3 hours after the package is received. If the package is received after normal duty
hours, the package must be surveyed not later than three hours from the beginning of the next
workday.
   A4.3.1. If the radioactive material received is a sealed source, the most recent leak test
   results must accompany the package, and a copy of these results must be sent to the IRSO. If
   this test does not accompany the sealed source, an individual approved by the IRSO performs
   the leak test before the item is placed into use. Current leak test results must accompany
   sealed sources shipped from RAFB.
   A4.3.2. Once the package has been monitored and cleared by an individual approved by the
   IRSO, contact the user or custodian and transport the material directly to the user or
   custodian. If the user or custodian cannot be located, store the radioactive material until the
   user or custodian accepts receipt. Note: Only authorized personnel will open or package
   containers of RAM.
A4.4. If the radioactive material is to be transported from RAFB, prepare for shipment and
packaging per applicable NRC and Department of Transportation regulations (Title 49 of the
Code of Federal Regulations). The Shipment Quality Assurance Checklist, provided by
AFRRAD, will be used to ensure all applicable regulations have been met. Contact the IRSO for
assistance and shipping surveys.

A5.2. Depleted Uranium Permit
   A5.2.1. Depleted Uranium (Permit # GA-00462-01/03AFP; Expiration date: 31 Aug 2014).
   A5.2.2. Permittee: Jimmy Beeland (574 CMMXS/MXDP)
   A5.2.3. Shop POC: Earnest Spradley (DSN: 468-4286)
   A5.2.4. Location: Bldg 149
   A5.2.5. This shop previously also worked in bldg 181 before moving entirely to bldg 149.
   DU shop personnel work on the C-5 aileron, which has DU counterweights. These
   counterweights emit detectable gamma rays, but particulate radiation is stopped by a thin
   aluminum platting that entirely covers it. This shop also maintains a storage area where DU
   weights are removed and stored in 55-gallon drums. When this room’s storage capacity
   nears maximum, AFRRAD will need to be contacted in order to collect the RAM. In order
   to provide exposures ALARA, this shop at one time maintained lead-platted boxes           that
   personnel could cover the DU counterweight with. However, the ability of these boxes to
   provide adequate attenuation is questionable. Also, due to the use of a safety bar to prevent
   the aileron flipping over, the boxes could not fit properly. As an administrative control, the
   DU T.O. requires a two-foot distance around the counterweights in which personnel are to
   minimize their occupancy.

A6.1. Non-Air Force Licenses on RAFB.
   A6.1.1. Two organizations are on RAFB that have Non-Air Force owned licenses and
   receive their licenses directly from the NRC. IAW 40-201, these organizations do not have
   direct oversight of the Surgeon General. However, the IRSO (representing the interests of
   the Installation Commander) has overall responsibility for any RAM on RAFB.

   A6.3.3. DLA has a certified health physicist, Dr. David Collins. The Safety & Occupational
   Health Specialists at DLA on RAFB go by the term Radiation Protection Officers (RPOs).
   DLA has its own RAM license (NRC License 37-30062-01) and is responsible for shipping,
   receiving, and storing LANTIRN LTRs related to the LANTIRN shop in Bldg 640. Receipt
   of the LTR from organizations not on RAFB is conducted in Bldg 376 where radiation
   workers conduct receipt surveys. After the item is accepted, it is transferred to Bldg 385 for
   secure storage. The radiation workers bring the LTR from Bldg 385 to Bldg 641 (Avionics
   Warehouse) for unpacking before it is brought to Bldg 640. The LANTIRN receiving
   personnel accept the item into AF control and log them for tracking. The item is then
   delivered to the LANTIRN repair section, which includes a clean room. Upon completion of
   maintenance or repair, the item is logged out of AF control and accepted by DLA
   Distribution. The item is taken to Bldg 641 for packing, Bldg 385 for storage, packing,
   shipping, and radiation swipe shipping survey.
