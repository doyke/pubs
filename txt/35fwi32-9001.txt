     property which results from reasonable, ordinary use over an extended period of time. This

3. Procedures:
     3.1. FM (facility manager)/Custodian (or alternate): When loss, damage, or destruction
     other than ordinary wear and tear has occurred to real property, immediately initiate an AF
     Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request according to instructions contained on the
     reverse side of the form. On the AF Form 332, item 27 include the name, grade, and
     organization of who is believed to be responsible for the damage. The custodian will sign the
     AF Form 332 (block 13) and forward it to the 35 CES Customer Service section (35
     CES/CEOSC). The custodian will provide an information copy of the work request to the
     commander of each individual identified in item 27.
        3.1.1. 35 CES Customer Service: After receipt of a work request indicating loss, damage
        or destruction to real property asset other than ordinary wear and tear, a memorandum
        (Attachment 1) is prepared and forwarded to the commander of the real property
        FM/custodian or individual identified in item 27 of the AF Form 332. 35 CES Customer
        Service maintains a copy of AF Form 332 in suspense until action has been taken by the
        responsible organization commander to have reimbursement made or report of survey
        completed.
        3.1.2. Squadron and Associate Unit Commanders who are assigned to the real property
        and whose individuals fall under their chain of command must ensure a report is filed
        with the Security Forces Squadron and have damage investigated before contacting the
        Civil Engineer Squadron to fix the damage.
        3.1.3. When commanders receive a memorandum reporting damage to real property,
        they must advise the real property FM/custodian or the person suspected of causing the
        damage in writing (Attachment 2) that they may elect to:
35FWI32-9001 10 MAY 2010                                                                      3


        3.1.3.1. Voluntarily repair the damage, pay a commercial contractor to repair the
        damage or request 35 CES to repair the damage and reimburse the government. All
        repairs must be completed according to UFC and Air Force standards, have
        government approval and are subject to the interpretation of the 35 CES Operation’s
        inspectors.
        3.1.3.2. Voluntarily pay the government for the actual or estimated cost of repairs or
        replacement. Individuals (if not scheduled to depart this station within 90 days) who
        accept responsibility for the loss, damage or destruction to real property and desire to
        pay the actual cost should return the report to 35 CES Customer Service, requesting
        the actual cost be provided with a statement of the individual's desire or intent to
        reimburse the government.
     3.1.4. When the real property custodian or the person suspected of causing the loss,
     damage or destruction refuses to accept liability, the commander will initiate a DD Form
     200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss. The commander will notify the
     BCE when the report of survey has progressed to a point where accomplishment of the
     repair work will not interfere with the investigation being conducted. Forward two
     copies of the completed report of survey to 35 CES Customer Service, who will then
     forward a copy to the Real Estate office.
     3.1.5. If liability cannot be determined, the real property custodian and the commander
     may return the inspector's report and request complete reimbursement of actual cost
     before the report of survey is conducted. The commander of the individual will then
     accept responsibility of the damage if real property custodian is scheduled to depart
     within 90 days.
     3.1.6. If personal accomplishment is elected, the individual will notify the Self-Help
     Store via AF Form 332 before work begins so customer-procured materials can be
     approved. Self-Help Store personnel will inspect to ensure the work conforms to UFC
     and Air Force standards. All repairs or replacements must be done within 15 days unless
     an extension is granted by the 35 CES Operations Flight Chief.
     3.1.7. If reimbursement is elected, prepare DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, or
     DD Form 362, Statement of Charges for Government Property Lost, Damaged or
     Destroyed, on notification by the commander.
        3.1.7.1. Forms and assistance are available at 35 CES Customer Service. Add the
        following statement on the voucher: "Used in lieu of a report of survey. I accept
        responsibility for damaged or lost real property and voluntarily reimburse the

        service will forward a copy to the Real Estate Management Office. Hand-carry the
        voucher for damaged or lost real property resulting from fires to the Base Fire Chief.
        Officers accepting responsibility, but not offering cash settlement, may execute DD
        Form 114, Military Pay Order, authorizing a deduction from pay.
     3.1.8. The commander, with assistance from the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate,
     determines if disciplinary action is warranted. Civilian employees may be subject to
     disciplinary action as appropriate.

       Housing Inspection Section 226-9966. The housing inspector will call in a work request
       to Housing Maintenance.
       3.2.2. 35 CES Housing Office: If the 35 CES Housing Office inspector determines the
       loss, damage or destruction to FH units was a result of the occupant’s abuse or
       negligence, the inspector will inform the occupant of his or her responsibilities, including
       how to make restitution or repair.
          3.2.2.1. The FH occupant, with approval from the 35 CES Housing Office, may
          repair the damage, pay a commercial contractor to repair the damage or allow the
          housing maintenance contractor to repair the damage and reimburse the government.
          In any case, the repair must have government approval before the inspector clears the
          member from FH.
          3.2.2.2. If the occupant does not agree to repair or reimburse for loss, damage or
          destruction, or the dollar value is over $500, the housing inspector will initiate a ROS.
          3.2.2.3. If the occupant is willing to pay for the loss, damage or destruction to real
          property and the dollar value is less than $500, the ROS process may be disregarded.
          The housing inspector will prepare and present to occupant the cost for the loss,
          damage, or destruction to real property. DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher or
          DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization, is utilized in the reimbursement
          collection process.
       3.2.3. 35 CES Housing Maintenance: When loss, damage, or destruction is found other
       than ordinary wear and tear to real property, immediately initiate AF Form 332,
       according to instructions contained on the reverse side of the form. The AF Form 332
       will be turned in to 35 CES Customer Service section.
    3.3. Unaccompanied Housing (UH):
       3.3.1. UH (unaccompanied housing) Occupant: When loss, damage or destruction, other
       than ordinary wear and tear, has occurred to unaccompanied housing, the occupant must
       call the 35 CES Unaccompanied Housing Manager at 226-4000. The UH manager
       determines whether the resident’s abuse or negligence caused the damage.
       3.3.2. 35 CES Unaccompanied Housing Office: If the UH manager determines the
       resident’s abuse or negligence caused the damage, the UH manager will inform the
       occupant of his or her responsibilities, including how to make restitution or repair. The
       UH Manager will call the 35 CES Customer Service to initiate a work order for repairs.
       3.3.2.1.    If the occupant does not accept responsibility for the loss, damage or
       destruction to real property, or if the dollar value is over $500, the UH Manager notifies
       the 35 CES Housing Asset Manager of the need for an ROS. The Housing Asset
       Manager requests an ROS to determine liability.
       3.3.3. If the occupant accepts responsibility for the loss, damage or destruction to real
       property and the dollar value is less than $500, the UH Manager will prepare the DD
       form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, or DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization.
