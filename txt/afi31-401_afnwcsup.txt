Terms
Export Controlled Technical Data—Data that cannot be lawfully exported without the
approval, authorization, or license under U.S. export control laws. The controlling regulations
and documents are the EAR, the ITAR, and the U.S. munitions list IAW AFI 61204, Attachment
1.
Nuclear Controlled Unclassified Information—Information related to: authorize, assemble,
operate, prearm, arm, target, launch or release a nuclear weapon. This also includes technical
information that can be used, or adapted for use, in system design, production, manufacture,
repair, overhaul, processing, engineering, development, or security.

Nuclear Related Technical Data—Technical data commonly refers to information (other than
software) which is required for the design, development, production, manufacture, assembly,
operation, repair, testing, maintenance or modification of defense articles IAW USC Title 22,
Article 120.10. Nuclear related technical data includes these elements, and includes information
related to authorization, assembly, prearming, arming, targeting, launching or releasing of a
nuclear weapon. This type of information was previously referred to as Nuclear Controlled
Unclassified Information.
Technical Information—Includes end items such as T.O.s (Operational Manuals, Field
Maintenance, Depot Maintenance), Process Orders and Work Control Documents, Commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) Manuals, Civil Engineering Manuals, Time Compliance TOs (TCTOs) for
Field and Depot Maintenance, Source Data, such as Specifications, Engineering Drawings,
Reports, and Bill of Material (BOM)This definition also includes Change Items such as
temporary modifications to technical data, to include AFTO 252, Technical Order Publication
Change Request, AFMC 202, Nonconforming Technical Assistance Request and Reply, change
requests (Engineering Orders and AFTO 22, Technical Manual Change Recommendation and
Reply), technical assistance, (Engineering Technical Assistance Request (ETAR) and
Maintenance Assistance Request (MAR)) and other data (such as test data and contractor
technical data).
Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information—Unclassified information on the physical
protection of DoD Special Nuclear Material (SNM), SNM equipment, and SNM facilities,
including unclassified information on the physical protection of nuclear weapons containing
SNM that are in DoD custody IAW DoD Instruction 5210.83, DoD Unclassified Controlled
Nuclear Information.

                    CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION

A2.9. (Added) Export-Controlled Technical Data. Data that cannot be lawfully exported
without the approval, authorization, or license under United States (U.S.) export control laws.
The controlling regulations and documents are the Export Administration Regulations (EAR),
the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), and the U.S. munitions list IAW AFI 61-
204, Disseminating Scientific and Technical Information, Attachment 1. Categories IV “Launch
Vehicles, Guided Missiles, Ballistic Missiles, Rockets, Torpedoes, Bombs and Mines” and
category XVI “Nuclear Weapons, Design and Testing Related Items” of the U.S. munitions list
designates Department of Defense (DoD) nuclear items and associated nuclear related technical
data as export-controlled technical data IAW United States Code (USC) Title 22, Article 121.1,
The United States Munitions List. This type of information was previously referred to as NCUI.
A2.10. (Added) Nuclear Related Technical Data. Technical data commonly refers to
information (other than software) which is required for the design, development, production,
manufacture, assembly, operation, repair, testing, maintenance or modification of defense
articles IAW USC Title 22, Article 120.10, Technical Data. Nuclear related technical data
includes these elements, and includes information related to authorization, assembly, prearming,
arming, targeting, launching or releasing of a nuclear weapon. This type of information was
previously referred to as NCUI. The NCUI term is being eliminated to avoid confusion with
Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI). Nuclear related technical data is distinctly
different from UCNI which is primarily focused on physical security. Identification of this type
of nuclear related technical data is a key component of addressing the management of this data
commensurate to its sensitivity.
A2.10.1. (Added) Access to Nuclear Related Technical Data.
A2.10.1.1. (Added) Units requesting access to nuclear publications should follow procedures
outlined in T.O. 00-5-1 and control secondary distribution IAW T.O. 00-5-3, AF Technical
Order Life Cycle Management. Requests for all other nuclear related technical data should be
submitted to afnwc.enworkflow@kirtland.af.mil.
A2.10.1.2. (Added) After the technical data request has been approved by the AFNWC, the
request will be forwarded to the weapon system specific program office for further consideration.
A2.10.1.3. (Added) Nuclear T.O. accounts and T.O. requests will be processed per T.O. 00-5-
1. The Technical Order Management Activity (TOMA) will be the approving authority for the
respective SPM for their assigned T.O.s. The Chief Engineer (or designated representative) for
the respective SPM will be the approving authority for all other nuclear related technical data
access requests.
A2.10.1.4. (Added) Access to nuclear related technical data will be approved on an individual
basis at designated distribution points. Distribution points are offices that have a mission
requirement for technical information for more than one sub-system (e.g., Base T.O. Distribution
Office (TODOs), depot planners, lead engineers).
A2.10.2. (Added) Controlling Nuclear Related Technical Data. Compartmentalization of
nuclear related technical data will allow for flexibility (based on mission needs) on how technical
information can be controlled. Segregation and access are two distinctly different aspects of
 8                                            AFI31-401_AFNWCSUP 5 SEPTEMBER 2013


compartmentalization. Segregation is the partition of information (physical or electronic)
whereas access is the approval to utilize the information. Nuclear related technical data will be
separated progressively in three levels:
A2.10.2.1. (Added) From other United States Air Force (USAF) information.
A2.10.2.2. (Added) Between weapon systems.
A2.10.2.3. (Added) Within elements of a weapon system.
A2.10.3. (Added) At a minimum, the sub-systems are identified in table A2.1.

A2.11. (Added) In assessing the feasibility of fielding AF nuclear related T. O.s in digital
media: the AFNWC has determined that adequate Information Assurance (IA) requirements, as
applied to existing digital T.O. Distribution repositories, are not, as yet, adequately mature for
nuclear related technical information. Pending completion of IA requirements and system
verification, nuclear related T.O. will continue to be available only as paper or Compact Disk
(CD). No digital distribution, digital copies or images of nuclear related T.O.s are authorized.
Distribution of temporary modification of technical information must be accomplished via Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) encrypted E-mail IAW T.O. 00-5-1. Further distribution will be
performed IAW AFI 61-204.
A2.12. (Added) New or existing electronic information systems of record: not currently in
use (e.g., Product Lifecycle Management System (PLMS), Expeditionary Combat Support
System (ECSS), Automated Technical Order System (ATOS)) shall not be populated with
Nuclear Related Technical Data without the written consent of the AFNWC/EN Director.
A2.13. (Added) Nuclear Related Technical Data: will be marked commensurate to the
information contained in the document (i.e., UCNI, For Official Use Only (FOUO), Export-
Controlled).
