guidance and procedures, in accordance with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 91-202, The US Air Force
Mishap Prevention Program, AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and Air Force Pamphlet
(AFPAM) 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques, to reduce the
potential for bird aircraft strike hazards at Spangdahlem Air Base (SAB). This instruction applies to all
organizations on SAB with a responsibility to help reduce this possibility and to increase awareness
when bird activity increases. Commanders and supervisors ensure work centers will comply with this
directive. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with (IAW) AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Changes to this publication include addition of the roles and responsibilities of the 726 AMS, updates of
offices of responsibility, BASH countermeasures, and composition of the BASH Working Group.
1. General.
   1.1. Daily and seasonal migratory bird movements create a bird strike hazard for operations of both
   the 52d Fighter Wing (FW) and the 726th Air Mobility Squadron (726 AMS). These hazards reduce
   the effectiveness of the flying missions through loss of valuable assets, manpower, and the repair
   costs they can incur. In addition, the presence of large numbers of birds may result in the periodic
   termination of flying operations. This instruction establishes procedures to help minimize these
   hazards. No single solution exists for the BASH problem; however, through a combined cooperative
   effort of several organizations, employing a variety of techniques, we can reduce the impact birds
   have on our wing. This instruction is designed to:

     or other modes of bird dispersion.
  2.8. 726 AMS:
     2.8.1. SAB is in a unique situation in which its airfield hosts not only three fighter squadrons but
     has also absorbed the transient cargo aircraft mission of the former Rhein-Main AB. To support
     this mission, the 726 AMS has become a tenant unit. Although the missions of host and tenant
     greatly differ, they rely on the same airfield and this mutual reliance requires a strong partnership
     to combat BASH issues and to implement an effective BASH plan.

     the 52 FW/CV. The BHWG submits all recommendations to the 52 FW/CC for approval.
SPANGDAHLEMABI91-212 13 APRIL 2009                                                                    7


   3.3. Composition. In addition to the chairman, BHWG membership will consist of representatives
   from 52 FW/SEF, 52 OG/OGV, Wing Foreign Object Damage Non-Commissioned Officer, 52
   CES/CEO, 52 CES/CEAN, 52 OSS/OSA, 726 AMS/SE, and the FSOs from each flying squadron.

   Once approved, the minutes will be disseminated to the BHWG membership, 52 OG/CC, and 52
   MXG/QA.
4. Bird Watch Conditions (BWC)
   4.1. The goal of BWC is to eliminate the loss of resources due to BASH mishaps through a system
   of temporary restrictions and dispersion efforts. This dynamic system calls for providing the correct
   amount of protection to resources without stagnating flying operations.
   4.2. Use the following terminology for rapid communication of bird activity and implement unit
   operational procedures.
      4.2.1. BWC SEVERE. Any number of birds on or immediately above the active runway or any
      location that represents an immediate hazard to safe flying operations. Pilots, supervisors and
      transient aircrews must thoroughly evaluate mission needs before operating in areas under
      condition SEVERE.
   4.2.2. BWC MODERATE. Any number of birds observed in locations which represent a probable
   hazard to safe flying operations. This condition requires increased vigilance by all agencies and
   extreme caution by aircrews.
      4.2.3. BWC LOW. Normal bird activity on and above the airfield with a low probability of
      hazard. BWC Low does not necessarily indicate an absence of birds but that bird activity is
      present but not a danger to aircraft.
      4.2.4. Bird Activity Phases I/II. In accordance with AFI 91-202, Phase I and II are periods of
      bird activity based on historical information for SAB. Phase I and II designations are published
      in 52 FW Flight Information Publications.
          4.2.4.1. BWC Low Phase II denotes heavy bird activity, normally associated with migratory
          season. This occurs at SAB from April-June and again during September-November. Phase
          II will be established by the 52 OG through the SOF during these periods. Aircrews are to
          remain vigilant during Phase II operations and coordinate with the SOF to adjust flying
          operations as required due to observed bird activity. Supervisors will receive current bird
          activity updates from the SOF before Aircrew step. SOFs will relay current applicable
          restrictions (if any) to Aircrew before takeoff. The observations and/or reporting may come
          from ground crew, aircrew, ATC, or SOF. Adjustments to flight operations may include, but
          are not limited to, cease of formation takeoffs or landings and limitations on multiple
          patterns.
          4.2.4.2. BWC Low Phase I will denote bird activity on and around the airfield representing a
          low potential for strikes. Note: BWC MODERATE and SEVERE should be in effect only
          while birds are physically present. Continuously monitor the bird threat so the BWC can be
          reduced to a lower level as soon as possible. When the birds depart the area, allow ample
          time (10-15 minutes) for bird dispersal prior to lowering BWC to the appropriate level.

        4.2.5. Table 1 is designed to be used as a ready reference to identify bird-watch conditions,
        BIRDTAM numbers and recommended action. It is to be used as a guide in determining what
        proactive measures are appropriate for the current bird activity level. In addition, the German
        BIRDTAM numbers/reports MAY also necessitate restrictions to USAF low altitude operations,
        but do NOT require specific action to be taken in Spangdahlemâ€™s pattern.

Note: . The SOF has judgment authority to raise and lower the BWC and implement flying restrictions
regardless of the specific numbers of birds observed.

     4.3. Communications. Disseminate bird-watch conditions by the following means:
SPANGDAHLEMABI91-212 13 APRIL 2009                                                                    9


      4.3.1. During flight operations, include bird-watch conditions other than LOW at SAB, low
      flying areas/training areas, etc. in the ATIS information. When the SOF declares bird-watch
      condition MODERATE or SEVERE, notify tower personnel, 52 FW/CP, flying squadrons and
      52 OG/CC. The 52 FW/CP will contact 52 FW/SEF, Maintenance Operations Control Center
      (MOCC), AMCC, and the fighter squadrons. 52 OSS/OSAM personnel will post the bird-watch
      condition in the flight planning room for transient aircrews and notify changes in conditions.
      Squadron operations personnel will post the bird-watch condition on their Notice to Airmen
      (NOTAM) board.
      4.3.2. The primary means of transmitting bird-watch conditions will be via ATIS. However,
      under bird-watch condition SEVERE (or MODERATE when restrictions have been imposed)
      SAB air traffic control agencies, in coordination with the SOF, will ensure pilots are advised of
      the condition and are provided the option to delay, divert or continue the proposed operation into
      hazardous areas.
5. 52 FW Pilot Responsibilities and Procedures.
   5.1. Pilots will report all known or suspected bird strikes to their squadron FSOs and ensure an
   automated AF Form 853 is annotated. Pilots may also be asked to fill out the AF Form 853 for a
   strike unknown to them in order for investigators to have a detailed record of the flight.
   5.2. Pilots observing or encountering hazardous bird activity should contact the SOF, ATC, nearest
   military base or range control officer and request the observed bird activity be passed on to the SOF
   or AM Ops. The following information should be included:
      5.2.1. Call sign.
      5.2.2. Location.
      5.2.3. Altitude.
      5.2.4. Time of sighting.
      5.2.5. Type of bird (if known).
      5.2.6. Approximate number of birds.
      5.2.7. Behavior of birds (soaring, flying to or from a location, etc.).
   5.3. Additional instructions to pilots are provided below based upon the coded bird-watch condition
   and location.
      5.3.1. Condition SEVERE.
          5.3.1.1. Traffic Pattern. Coordinate with the SOF to determine whether aircraft will be
          diverting or holding until the birds are dispersed. Takeoffs are prohibited.
          5.3.1.2. Ranges/Training Areas. A specific area and altitude will be identified. That area
          will be avoided by all flights.
          5.3.1.3. Low-level Areas. Note and avoid specific routes or segments and altitudes.
      5.3.2. Condition MODERATE.
          5.3.2.1. Traffic Pattern. Only patterns authorized will be full stop landings and restricted
          low approaches. Takeoffs will be accomplished as single ships. Limit formations to 2-ship
          when flying up initial. Pilots will be particularly cognizant of bird activity when on final
          approach and consider initiating an immediate go-around if a bird strike appears imminent.

         5.3.3. Ranges/Training Areas. Make changes in flight profile or altitudes to avoid bird hazards.
         5.3.4. Low-level Areas. Make amendments to flight altitude to minimize bird hazards. Limit
         close formation to a minimum for mission and training requirements.
      5.4. Condition LOW. (All locations) Continue with normal operating procedures.
6. Hazards Specific to SAB and Appropriate Countermeasures.
      6.1. The following is a summary of bird strike hazards around SAB and recommendations for
      reducing each hazard. A brief description of each species and how it may be controlled or avoided is
      included. Each control measure will require action by one or more tasked organizations as described
      in the basic plan. It is important to know which species is present before control techniques can be
      applied effectively. An appropriate field guide should be used to aid in bird identification.
         6.1.1. Waterfowl (ducks, geese, swans). Migrating waterfowl are particularly dangerous to
         flight safety due to their numbers, size and higher flight altitude. Large flocks of waterfowl
         travel along traditional airways to their breeding and wintering grounds during spring and fall.
         Huge flocks may stop along the route awaiting favorable weather conditions. Migrating birds
         are most active from sunset through midnight, with numbers decreasing in the early morning
         hours. Avoiding night flying is the safest approach. Wintering concentration areas should be
         avoided.
         6.1.2. Raptors (German buzzards (hawks), falcons, kites, eagles and vultures). These birds can
         be particularly hazardous to aircraft because of their size and widespread distribution of habitats
         near the base and low-level flying areas. Raptors, particularly vultures, use thermals to their
         advantage to search for prey. These birds become active during mid-morning and remain aloft
         until late afternoon. Avoid areas with thermal generating terrain such as ridgelines, rolling hills
         and bodies of water.
         6.1.3. Cranes. These large birds are most hazardous during migrating periods, particularly in the
         fall when a large number of birds may be concentrated in a small area.
         6.1.4. Pigeons and doves. These birds are seedeaters and are attracted to seed producing weeds,
         grasses and shrubs. Open areas or bare spots are attractive as resting or feeding sites.
         6.1.5. Crows and ravens. These omnivorous birds are common in open areas. They may occur
         in large flocks, particularly at sunset as they return to their roost site.
         6.1.6. Blackbirds, grackles, cowbirds, starlings, lapwings and magpies. These birds can be
         particularly hazardous because they frequently occur in huge flocks. Blackbirds and starlings are
         attracted to flat, open areas to feed, rest or stage.
         6.1.7. While concern is mostly centered on birds, several mammalian species also pose a threat
         to flight operations.
             6.1.7.1. Rabbits and hare. Can cause damage to aircraft on take-off and landing rolls; these
             animals also attract raptors and fox.
             6.1.7.2. Rodents. Several species of rodents live on SAB and are attractants of raptors and
             fox.
             6.1.7.3. Fox. Fox entering the airfield pose a significant hazard as they frequently cross the
             runway at night in search of food.
SPANGDAHLEMABI91-212 13 APRIL 2009                                                                        11


   6.2. Countermeasures. There must be a concerted effort between several agencies and a pro-active
   approach to bird/wildlife control in order to successfully execute an effective BASH plan.
   Countermeasures without prior coordination can threaten air traffic as birds will take flight, therefore
   it is imperative that countermeasures be employed only with the consent of the 52 OSS/OSAT, the
   SOF, or 52 OSS/OSAM.
      6.2.1. Airfield attractiveness. The first step in controlling airfield wildlife is to make the airfield
      as inhospitable as possible. This can effectively be done by maintaining the prescribed grass
      height, removal of dead vegetation, monitoring and leveling of low lying areas, and proper
      drainage. In addition, frequent inspections of the fence line for means of entry by fox or other
      larger animals will aid in preventing animals on the airfield.
      6.2.2. Fox urine pellets. The scent of fox urine is proven to be an effective means of driving
      away prey such as rabbits, hare and several rodent species. Because many predatory birds hunt
      the same prey as fox, placing pellets on the airfield can have a positive impact towards
      alleviating a food source of both fox and larger birds. When the population of prey warrants, fox
      pellets should be utilized.
      6.2.3. Bird Cannons with bioacoustics. The Scare Wars system in use by the 52 FW is a series
      of state of the art bird cannons, some equipped with bioacoustics. The remote-enabled system is
      a proven, convenient and expedient means of dispersing birds. The system is most useful when
      unpredictable, as birds can be conditioned to accept routine scheduled employment. The
      cannons are portable and should be moved to accommodate new areas of congregation and
      nesting. Those activating the cannons should also be aware of what mode of the system is most
      effective against the targeted species (e.g. cannon blast, distress cry generator, or a combination).
      6.2.4. Falconry. Contracted falconry has proven to be an effective deterrent to controlling the
      bird and rabbit/hare population on base and remains an integral part of BASH plan. The OPR for
      Falconry services is 52 CES/CEOIE.
      6.2.5. Pyrotechnics, bangers, screamers. These bird dispersion techniques are advantageous in
      their portability but due to explosive hazards must be maintained IAW AFMAN 91-201,
      Explosive Safety Standards. In addition, documented annual training must be accomplished.
      6.2.6. Paintball guns. Paintball guns may be used in lieu of or in addition to other handheld
      dispersion devices but users must have documented annual training. The OPR is 52
      OSS/OSAM.
      6.2.7. Depredation. Local law forbids deliberate killing of birds on SAB without permission
      from the German Forest Authority (United States Fish and Wildlife equivalent). Permission is
      reviewed and renewed as explained in paragraph 2.9.2.2. Depredation is performed only by an
      appointed licensed local national hunter and only in cases of emergencies or when alternative
      means prove ineffective.
