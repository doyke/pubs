               AIR FORCE MEDICAL SERVICE READINESS PROGRAM

1.1. Mission Overview. The Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) provides seamless health
service support to AF and combatant commanders (CCDR) and assists in sustaining the
performance, health and fitness of every Airman in-garrison and while deployed within the
Continental United States (CONUS) or overseas (OCONUS) in support of global operations.
This capability is summarized by the phrase “global medical readiness” which includes the full
spectrum of medical operations (expeditionary deployment operations, humanitarian assistance,
all-hazards response, and global health engagement to support building partnerships and stability
operations). It also includes the necessary planning, training, and readiness support functions
(reports, disaster management, and others) associated with these operations. Components of this
global system are fully integrated, with forward-deployed medical support, and en route care to
facilities providing comprehensive definitive medical specialty care. The foundational emphasis
is on prevention of illness and injury. When illness or injury does occur, the AFMS provides a
rapidly responding modular medical capability which can be tailored to meet specific
requirements. If more definitive care is required, the AFMS supports an effective “evacuate and
replace” policy through aeromedical evacuation (AE) of joint and combined forces. With this
focus on preventive medicine, superior health care, and aeromedical evacuation, the AFMS
promotes and advocates the optimization of human performance sustainment and enhancement,
including the optimal integration of human capabilities with operational systems. To achieve the
mission, the AFMS developed processes to support operational strategies, emergency
management, medical readiness training, manpower and equipment force packaging, medical
readiness resourcing, aeromedical evacuation and global medical operations plans and reporting.
The following sections will introduce these areas:
1.2. Operational Strategies. The AFMS employs multiple planning strategies to ensure
capabilities are organized, trained, equipped, and available to meet contingency requirements.
   1.2.1. Modular Capabilities. The AFMS provides a light, lean, modularized medical
   capability that can be deployed rapidly to support operations overseas and at home.
       1.2.1.1. Most initial medical support begins with either the Global Reach Laydown
       (GRL) team or the Squadron Medical Element (SME). The GRL UTC FFGRL consists
       of four personnel and is assigned to the Contingency Response Group (CRG) to provide
       medical support during rapid opening of contingency airfields. The purpose of the CRG
       is to bring significant order, foresight, speed, and safety during the critical opening days
       of a contingency. The SME is a small team designed to provide aerospace medicine
       support to an AF flying squadron. This team deploys with the squadron and provides
       care and initial preventive medicine surveillance. As support to the expeditionary
       squadron grows, the SME can be augmented with additional independent duty medical
       technicians (IDMTs) and a preventive aerospace medicine (PAM) team. The PAM team
       provides aerospace medicine support during the opening of a contingency airbase,
       including performing the GRL role described in this Instruction if that UTC is not tasked.
       If the beddown site becomes a more permanent operating site or the population at risk
       (PAR) increases, the AFMS can deploy the Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS)
6                                                                     AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014


       system. The scalable nature of EMEDS allows the AF to deploy capabilities from small
       teams that can provide highly skilled medical care for a limited number of casualties, to a
       medical system as large as an Air Force Theater Hospital (AFTH) that can provide
       specialized medical care to a PAR of several thousand.
       1.2.1.2. For casualties requiring more definitive care than that provided by the EMEDS,
       the Global Patient Movement System can provide rapid movement of patients to the
       appropriate level of care. As a component of the USAF Mobility Air Forces (MAF)
       system, AE crews provide en-route medical care to stabilized patients during transport on
       MAF aircraft. Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATTs) are used to augment AE
       crews to provide advanced specialty medical capability to evacuate critically ill, injured,
       or burned patients requiring continuous stabilization and advanced care during transport.
       1.2.1.3. These modular capabilities are organized by force modules to complement
       increases in combat capability. As a beddown grows, predetermined support assets,
       including medical assets, are deployed to that beddown. These predetermined modules
       provide an organized expansion capability, offer predictability to the supporting units,
       and simplify the planning process.
       1.2.1.4. In addition to missions associated with aircraft beddown locations, AFMS forces
       may deploy in support of stability operations to build partner nation governance and
       security capacity as well as provide humanitarian aid and disaster relief.
    1.2.2. Capabilities-based Planning. The AF has shifted from a programs/platforms mentality
    to capabilities-based planning. Commanders and their planners identify requirements for
    specific capabilities not for units, and those capabilities are then associated with trained and
    available unit type codes (UTCs). In order to quantify capabilities, the Office of the
    Secretary of Defense (OSD) has directed that all Services observe, assess, and report their
    units’ ability to perform through mission essential tasks (METs) measured against a specific
    standard.
    1.2.3. AEF Teaming and Force Presentation. AFMS personnel assigned to warfighting
    organizations (e.g. MTFs, portions of Human Systems Wing (HSW), etc.) are placed in either
    a standard deployable UTC or an associate UTC and given an AEF assignment in the
    Medical Readiness Decision Support System (MRDSS). Personnel assigned to institutional
    force (IF) designated UICs (e.g. HAF, MAJCOM, training units) will have an AEF Indicator
    (AEFI) of X, and will not be postured in UTCs.
       1.2.3.1. UTC assigned medical forces are presented as Health Service Support (HSS)
       Demand Force Teams (DFTs) to meet CCDR requirements and/or AF missions. AC
       capabilities are managed at 1:2 deploy-to-dwell ratio and ARC capabilities are managed
       at a 1:5 mob-to-dwell ratio. Medical DFTs are presented in five categories to provide the
       full range of HSS to deployed and in-place warfighters and enable global patient
       movement with CCATTs and patient staging capabilities.
           1.2.3.1.1. Home Station Health Service Support Teams. Provide and enhance a
           healthy and fit force from accession to veteran includes optimizing health/fitness of
           peacetime forces, maintaining health/fitness of deployed forces, and restoring the
           physical and mental health of redeployed service members.
AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014                                                                       7


         1.2.3.1.2. Expeditionary Medical Support Teams. Provide rapidly deployable
         medical capability for up to five separate operating locations of varying sizes in
         support of an AETF or other contingency operations.
         1.2.3.1.3. Expeditionary En-route Care Teams. Provide CCATT's and 700 combined
         staging beds at up to six operating locations in support of the global patient
         movement mission.
         1.2.3.1.4. Special Operations Medical Support Teams. Provide small, highly skilled,
         tactically trained medical teams that utilize lean and tailored equipment packages in
         support of US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) missions.
     1.2.3.2. All UTC assigned personnel will be aligned to a specified HSS DFT and
     postured in AEF vulnerability periods in accordance with the approved AFMS
     Prioritization and Sequencing Guidance and the AFMS Medical Resource Letter (MRL).
  1.2.4. Constant Deployer Model (CDM). The AFMS supports the Air and Space
  Expeditionary Force (AEF) strategy and postures its deployable capabilities evenly across the
  AEF. These deployable forces are mainly assigned to large medical treatment facilities using
  a CDM. The model maximizes laydown of key teams at facilities most able to provide the
  complex clinical caseload required for clinical currency while simultaneously providing
  sufficient copies of a UTC to support each AEF vulnerability period. By concentrating
  deployment capability at large facilities, individuals and teams are able to leverage their
  home-station responsibilities to maintain readiness currency in individual tasks, and to a
  large degree, team METs. Additional guidance and information may be found in AFI 10-
  401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution, AEF On-line page, and the AFMS
  Posturing and Sequencing Guide.
  1.2.5. Consultant Balanced Deployments (CBD). The CBD concept ensures AEF
  deployment requirements are met using the most qualified individuals available at any one
  time from across the AFMS by balancing deployments for their specialty, primarily those
  considered critical operational readiness Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC). Additionally,
  this concept limits interruptions to home station health care and maximizes individual career
  development and growth. Refer to the AFMS Posturing and Sequencing (P&S) Guidance for
  additional information.
  1.2.6. Stability Operations. The term “stability operations” refers to various military
  missions, tasks, and activities conducted outside the United States in coordination with other
  instruments of national power to maintain or reestablish a safe and secure environment, and
  provide essential government services, emergency infrastructure reconstruction, and
  humanitarian relief. The Air Force must be prepared to work with other Services to conduct
  stability operations throughout all phases of conflict in both combat and non-combat
  environments. Stability operations may be small or large scale, lasting for the short or long-
  term.
     1.2.6.1. Integrated military and civilian operations are essential to successful stability
     operations; consequently, the Air Force will collaborate with other Services and US
     governmental agencies, foreign governments, international government and
     nongovernmental organizations, and private sector firms as directed to plan, prepare for
 8                                                                    AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014


        and conduct stability operations. The AFMS has a critical role in supporting stability
        operations by providing essential medical services and providing humanitarian assistance.
        1.2.6.2. AF medical personnel and capabilities must be prepared to meet military and
        civilian health requirements in medical stability operations. To meet this requirement,
        training will be provided to prepare personnel for stability operations in accordance with
        DODI 3000.05, Stability Operations, and DODI 6000.16, Military Health Support for
        Stability Operations.
     1.2.7. Joint Interoperability. The AF fights jointly. In recent years, OSD has reinforced
     commitment to joint interoperability and joint training in most strategic planning and training
     documents. This commitment is seen in using METs for training and expanding training
     opportunities through the use of joint field exercises as training venues for AFMS teams,
     when appropriate. Teams that are likely to deploy with medical teams from a different
     Service, or in direct support of a joint operation such as casualty staging and CCATTs, are
     prime candidates for a joint exercise operation.
1.3. Medical Emergency Management. AF fixed medical facilities worldwide plan for
conducting their home station and expeditionary missions simultaneously. Home station
missions include facility expansion, which can increase the bed capacity of some MTFs to
receive and care for large numbers of casualties; medical surveillance; Chemical, Biological,
Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) detection and analysis; patient decontamination; and medical
response/support to contingencies confined to the installation or involving Federal, State, Local,
or Tribal agencies, or Host Nation governments, including CBRN incidents. The AFMS also
participates in the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) with Federal Coordinating Centers
(FCCs) capable of receiving, triaging, and distributing civilian patients to NDMS hospitals and
with Primary Receiving Centers and Secondary Centers capable of receiving, treating and
holding military patients resulting from a military or homeland contingency. Designated AF
MTFs serve as FCCs and Secondary Coordinating Centers (SCCs) within the NDMS, providing
support and leadership to the local hospitals contributing to the NDMS bed capability. Air
National Guard medical personnel may be tasked to serve at the Joint Force Headquarters
(JFHQ) Joint Operations Center as planners and liaison officers to provide state level Defense
Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). To maintain a capability to respond to all contingencies,
the AFMS relies on highly-trained medical warriors and state-of-the-art, light, ruggedized
medical equipment. Comprehensive planning and realistic exercises ensure personnel are
prepared to support expeditionary and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR)
operations. Overarching guidance for the AF emergency management program and the AF
Incident Management System (AFIMS) is contained in AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency
Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. Specific details on the AFMS
emergency management mission are provided throughout this Instruction.                 Additional
information on NDMS can be found on the AF Medical Readiness SharePoint Site at:
https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-SG-AF-83/default.aspx, in the NDMS folder.
1.4. Medical Readiness Training. AFMS personnel require highly specialized initial,
sustainment, and theater-specific training to respond to varied missions and environments. To
meet an all-hazards incident response capabilities also requires the training outlined in AFI 10-
2501. A continual assessment process ensures this training remains relevant and effective.
AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014                                                                            9


   1.4.1. Current Training System. Training is provided for individuals, teams (collective
   training), and leaders, that prepares personnel to integrate themselves into joint medical
   platforms and situations. The training system includes AFSC-awarding training courses,
   clinical currency platforms, courses for deployment platforms, local courses and briefings,
   and exercises.
   1.4.2. Fully Qualified Mindset. Personnel should not be assigned to a readiness tasking or
   standard UTC until they hold a fully qualified AFSC (4XX3 for officers or 4XX51 enlisted).
   However, personnel holding AFSCs 4XX1 for officers and 4XX31 for enlisted may be
   substituted on UTCs in accordance with AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution,
   as long as sufficient oversight and skill capability is present on the UTCs. The unit
   commander must review UTC assignments to ensure mission capability. (T-2)
1.5. Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) Responsible Agencies
(MRA). To maintain the viability and effectiveness of its deployable medical capabilities, the
AFMS has assigned MEFPAK responsibilities to MAJCOM/SGXs. Air Combat Command is
the MRA for medical ground-based unit type codes (UTCs) and the lead MAJCOM for the
Medical Counter-Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (MC-CBRN) program. Air
Mobility Command is the MRA for AE, patient staging, aeromedical en route care support
personnel and equipment UTCs, and patient movement items (PMI). Air Force Special
Operations Command is the MRA for special operations medical UTCs. Additional MAJCOMs
with mission or theater-unique capabilities requirements may also serve as a MRA with
AF/SG3X approval. Pilot units work closely with the MRAs to construct UTCs, associated
mission capability statements (MISCAPs), and manpower details.
1.6. Medical Readiness Resourcing. To maintain a robust medical readiness capability, the
AFMS manages the funding for training, exercises, personnel and equipment through an internal
planning, programming, and budgeting system.
1.6.1. Readiness Requirements Planning and Resourcing (RRPR). The goal of the RRPR is
to program for and execute Line of the Air Force Working Capital Fund Medical Dental
Division, Line of the Air Force O&M, and Defense Health Program (DHP) Medical Resources.
The primary objectives of the RRPR process are to: (1) create a knowledgeable, cross-functional
decision process that enables and tracks the execution of AFMS readiness programs; (2) capture
the AFMS specific capability requirements needed by CCDRs to support joint war fighting
medical support, (3) focus resource needs for organize, train and equip functions; (4) provide a
validation mechanism to review requirements and apply resources; (5) communicate AF/SG
intent regarding application of resources; and (6) provide best possible recommendations to the
AF/SG regarding readiness programs.
       1.6.1.1. Medical Readiness Panel (MRP). The MRP is the AFMS center of expertise for
       all readiness-specific organize, train, equip and plan functions and serves as the first level
       of corporate review. The panel is the initial point of entry for issues from PEMs and
       MRAs that require corporate review. The panel reviews and develops options for
       presentation to the corporate board. Throughout the year, the MRP focuses upon
       information collection and meets as required. The MRP is chaired by AF/SG3X.
       1.6.1.2. The MRP ensures resources are provided across the AFMS to create and
       maintain global response initiatives. Medical readiness resources are provided by
10                                                                AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014


     Defense Health Programs (DHP) funding for operations and maintenance (O&M) and
     PMI, and LAF funding for War Reserve Materiel (WRM) and MC-CBRN assets.
  1.6.2. Business Planning. Medical treatment facility commanders execute a business plan
  that maximizes the use of assigned personnel and available resources. This strategy allows a
  commander to plan and execute effective training at a predictable cost in terms of both
  resources and medical treatment facility production in three ways: readiness case analysis,
  currency case analysis, and business case analysis. Readiness is a critical element of
  business planning and should include training requirements, exercise opportunities, and
  deployment and contingency response obligations.
  1.6.3. Medical Counter-CBRN (MC-CBRN) Resources. The AFMS plans for contingencies
  that exceed the normal operating capacity of field units. The AFMS utilizes LAF MC-CBRN
  funds to provide additional material needed to execute the Medical Contingency Response
  Plan (MCRP) during these situations. This material is presented as the 886 allowance
  standards (AS) for AC and reserve units, and 976 AS for ANG (Attachment 3) to enable
  standardized training, as well as centralized logistics and maintenance support. This materiel
  will continue to be modernized and funded within the DoD Chemical Biological Defense
  Program (CBDP) and AF Operations & Maintenance (O&M) program element (PE) 28036F
  (MC-CBRN) (AC and non-collocated AFRC units) and ANG O&M PE 58036F (MC-
  CBRN), but will be fielded by the medical unit as all-hazards emergency management
  resources in support of the MTF’s MCRP, or the ANG’s support of their Installation’s
  Emergency Management Plan (IEMP) 10-2, DSCA or local support agreements. LAF
  funding may only be used to replenish items as required for shelf life management and to
  replenish those consumed during contingencies, exercises, and training involving CBRN
  hazards. Replenishment of AS materiel consumed during contingencies, exercises, and
  training not involving CBRN hazards will be replenished using appropriate exercise funding
  or DHP if an MTF Health Services related mission requirement.
     1.6.3.1. The 886 AS provides a capability starting point which can then be tailored to
     meet the unique needs of each MTF. For full-time non-collocated AFRC bases, this
     capability shall be maintained by the Bioenvironmental Engineering/Public Health
     Office. For ANG Medical Units, this capability will be assigned under the 976 MC-
     CBRN program to the full-time medical staff.
     1.6.3.2. MC-CBRN resources (also referred to as Home Station Medical Response,
     HSMR, in unrevised documents) are programmed at the AF/SG and NGB/SG levels by
     consolidating input from MAJCOMs and DRUs, and advocating for MC-CBRN
     requirements through the AF and ANG Installation Support Panels.
     1.6.3.3. The NG HRFs/CERFPs provide unique military and civilian life saving
     capabilities and expertise to assist the Governors in responding to a CBRNE or other
     mass casualty incident which may include large numbers of fatalities. These NG
     HRFs/CERFPs can be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for regional or national
     deployment for response operations. Guidance for the HRF/CERFP mission can be
     found in NGR 500-4/ANGI 10-2504, National Guard CBRNE Enhanced Response Force
     Package Management, and NGB HRF/CERFP Yearly Guidance. These documents
     prescribe policies, procedures, training, and responsibilities governing the deployment
AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014                                                                         11


       and employment of HRF/CERFP in support of the National Guard Homeland Security
       mission.
   1.6.4. Unit Medical Operations Resourcing. The unit Medical Readiness Committee
   (MRC), or Executive Management Committee (EMC) for ARC units, identifies unit
   readiness training and resource requirements and provides a consolidated document to their
   respective MAJCOM. For a full discussion of medical resource processes and procedures
   see AFI 41-120, Medical Resource Operations.
1.7. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). "The AFMS partners with the Operations (A3)
community to provide AE capability for homestation and global operations. The A3 staff
provides comprehensive operational AE readiness guidance in AFI 10-2912, Aeromedical
Evacuation Readiness Programs, while the SG staff is responsible for clinical guidance for AE
crews and medical/training guidance for SG managed AE UTCs, including WRM medical
equipment allowance standards and operational CCATT/AE kit support program. Training,
plans, and reporting requirements listed in this instruction for fixed medical facilities (medical
units) do not apply to AE units.
1.8. Global Medical Operations Plans and Reporting. Realistic, comprehensive plans that
describe responsibilities and procedures to perform the unit’s mission are critical in building and
maintaining highly effective medical response. Reporting systems, such as Status of Resources
and Training System (SORTS), Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) Enhanced Status
of Resources and Training System (ESORTS), AEF Reporting Tool (ART), and other reports,
provide planners at Combatant Commands, MAJCOMs, and senior leaders valuable data with
which to make planning and resourcing decisions relevant to myriad AF taskings. Unit planning
for global medical operations is discussed in Chapter 5, and medical readiness reports are
discussed in Chapter 9 of this Instruction.
1.9. Special Command Considerations. Policy guidance for commanders of Limited Scope
(LS), Limited Scope with Inter-service Support (LSISS), and deployed MTFs may differ from
that provided for other MTFs. Specific provisions for these units are provided in Chapters 4, 5,
6, 7 and 8 of this Instruction.
   1.9.1. LS MTFs are medical functional flights and small medical squadrons that do not
   provide the scope of services found in a Medical Group (includes Reserve Medical Units
   (RMU)). LS MTFs are assigned to non-medical squadrons or groups (e.g. Air Base
   Squadrons, Mission Support Groups or Air Base Groups). In some cases, the LS MTFs may
   report directly to the wing. Note: ARC units are considered LS MTFs for all requirements in
   this AFI.
   1.9.2. LSISS MTFs are tenant units on bases where at least two Services share resources.
   Joint base MTFs that are host units are not considered LSISS MTFs.
   1.9.3. Deployed MTFs. Any AF medical facility established in response to a contingency
   situation may be termed a deployed MTF by HQ AF/SG.

                  MEDICAL READINESS PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

3.1. The Medical Readiness Office. The MR office is the hub of readiness activities at the unit
level. Personnel assigned to this office manage programs spanning the full range of global
medical operations activities. To meet program requirements, there must be a minimum of two
full-time personnel assigned to the MR office. For ARC, “full-time” refers to traditional
reservists filling the MRO or MRNCO roles. (T-3) Waivers for this requirement must be
coordinated with the parent MAJCOM/SGX and Associate Corps Chief for Readiness prior to
submission in accordance with AFI 33-360. Two primary positions in the MR office are the
Medical Readiness Officer (MRO) and the Medical Readiness NCO (MRNCO). Depending on
the size of the facility and the medical readiness program, the MRO may be appointed on a part-
time basis. In this instance, a second enlisted member must be assigned to meet the two-person
minimum staffing requirement. Whether full or part-time, the MRO must have sufficient time
and resources to perform required MRO functions. A DOD civilian Medical Readiness Manager
(MRM) may fill either the MRO or MRNCO position in a full-time capacity. LS, LSISS, and
deployed MTFs are exempt from the two-person minimum staffing requirement.
   3.1.1. Tenure. The MRO, MRNCO and MRM will serve in their positions for a minimum of
   24 months, unless reassigned due to a permanent change in station (PCS). (T-3)
   3.1.2. Core Competency. Medical readiness is a core competency for the 041AX officers
   and the 4A0X1 enlisted personnel. Therefore, 041AX medical service corps officers and
   4A0X1 healthcare managers should be the primary AFSCs assigned to the Medical
   Readiness Office. Other individuals may be added to the medical readiness staff as
   appropriate. For AFRC units only, when 041AX and/or 4A0X1 personnel are not assigned,
   personnel with any medical AFSC may serve as the MRO or MRNCO. Every effort should
   be made to avoid assigning additional duties, such as security manager, building custodian,
   etc., to the MR office staff. Unit level medical readiness positions are not authorized the “R”
   AFSC prefix. However, MR enlisted personnel may be awarded the 325 special experience
   identifier (SEI) upon successful completion of the Medical Readiness Management Course
   (MRMC) and a year of serving in the MR office.
   3.1.3. Training. For AC units, all personnel assigned to the MR office (military and
   civilians) will attend and successfully complete L3OZJ4XXX 00BA, Medical Readiness
   Management Course (MRMC) before or within six months of assignment. ARC MR office
   personnel will attend within 12 months of assignment. (T-2) Prerequisites for attending the
   MRMC includes completing position-specific and UDM training modules in MRDSS
   ULTRA, provided on the MRDSS training server. The MRMC staff will identify areas not
   successfully completed to the individuals' home units for additional training and supervision
   until competency is achieved.
3.2. MR Appointed Roles. MRO/MRNCO/MRM responsibilities are discussed in paragraph
2.1.19. of this Instruction and outlined in this chapter.
   3.2.1. Unit Deployment Manager (UDM). UDMs have primary responsibility for managing
   personnel assigned to UTC positions and ensuring those personnel are trained and equipped

     3.2.1.1. Identify personnel to fill UTC positions, in coordination with the unit AFSC
     functional manager and squadron commanders, using the Control AFSC (CAFSC) for
     enlisted personnel and Duty AFSC (DAFSC) for officers. (T-2) Ensure the best AFSC
     and grade skill level match in accordance with AFI 10-403, the UTC Mission Capability
     Statements (MISCAPs) and other applicable supplemental processing guidance or
     reporting instructions. Prior to assigning personnel to UTCs and/or selecting individuals
     to deploy:
        3.2.1.1.1. Review Duty Status reports from the Commander’s Support Staff (CSS).
        3.2.1.1.2. Verify individual duty status and deployment availability (DAV) codes to

     response plans, identification of medical response capabilities required to execute those
     plans, and an analysis of capability shortfalls. This assessment will also be considered
     when assessing mission capability in DRRS for AFOP 4.4.3.6., M1.
AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014                                                                      39


        3.2.4.2.1. Response capability assessment will be briefed by the MRO to the MRC
        (or EMC) at a frequency determined by the medical unit commander. (T-3)
        Associated team chiefs will participate in the briefing whenever capabilities are
        degraded. The unit commander will consider this information in assessing the unit’s
        medical emergency response capabilities in DRRS, under AFOP 4.4.3.6., M1.
        3.2.4.2.2. Medical units will report the results of their response capability assessment
        to the installation's Emergency Management Working Group (EMWG) and
        Installation Readiness Council (IRC) annually. (T-3) This allows installation
        commanders to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions to ensure
        installation response capabilities are maintained.
     3.2.4.3. Units that maintain MC-CBRN assets (886 allowance standards (AS) for AFRC
     and AD units, 976 AS for ANG) will report MC-CBRN/HSMR as a generation mission
     in MRDSS ULTRA and in DRRS. (T-0: DoDI 7730.66, CJCSI 3401.02B, AFPD 10-2,
     CJCSM 3150.01, CJCSI 3401.02) Include military members and civilians assigned to
     MCRP teams in the required, assigned and available numbers.
     3.2.4.4. Medical units may tailor the baseline capabilities provided by 886 AS by
     substituting organic or locally leveraged capability in lieu of select 886AS sub-
     assemblage(s). Tailoring does not involve the reduction of levels within a sub-
     assemblage. Tailoring will follow the AF/SG3 approved guidelines, considering local
     threats, and can utilize local capabilities leveraged through an MOU/MOA/MAA. For
     ANG collocated units, tailoring of 976 AS is initiated at the unit level and routed through
     Wing/CC, State Air Surgeon, The Adjutant General (TAG) and to NGB/SGAX for
     action. Prior to finalizing allowance standard requirements, installation leadership will
     be briefed on both the medical unit contingency response capabilities and those accessed
     externally through an MOU/MOA/MAA.
     3.2.4.5. MTFs assigned MC-CBRN assemblages are not authorized to decrease AS
     levels but may enhance local capabilities based on threat assessments, medical
     capabilities and limiting factors. Increases to AS levels must be approved by the
     MRC/EMC and documented in the minutes. Approved increases will be forwarded to the
     parent MAJCOM/SG for final approval. EXCEPTION: If assigned, LS and LSISS MTFs
     may modify 886 AS to provide appropriate capability with HQ ACC/SGXH approval.
     3.2.4.6. The following guidance applies to ANG units that maintain the MC-CBRN
     response assets (976AS):
        3.2.4.6.1. Provide ANG manpower consisting of full-time installation staff who are
        certified by on-site, formal DoD school, or other training programs as coordinated by
        NGB/SGAX. (T-1)
            3.2.4.6.1.1. 976A - Patient Decontamination Team must have one full-time medic
            POC and 11 full-time non-medical personnel, as a minimum.
            3.2.4.6.1.2. 976H - BE Team will consist of all full-time Bioenvironmental team
            personnel.

     3.2.4.7. The following guidance applies only to non-collocated AFRC units that maintain
     the MC-CBRN Bioenvironmental Engineering (886H) assemblage:
        3.2.4.7.1. The full time Bioenvironmental Engineering office assigned to the MSG
        owns and is required to maintain the assemblages to accomplish the threat agent
        surveillance mission (T-1) (N/A to Ft. Worth NAS and Pope AAF).
        3.2.4.7.2. For non-collocated AFRC units, 886H assets will be maintained in DMLSS
        by the host MTF. The host MTF is responsible for establishing the account, ordering
        supplies and equipment, inputting receivables, and documenting inventory results in
        DMLSS. (T-0: DODI 3020.52) The supported unit will appoint a unit property
        custodian (normally BE personnel assigned to LAF units) for the assemblage. (T-0:
        DODI 3020.52) The property custodian will ensure required inventories are
        conducted and forward inventory data to the host medical logistics activity, which
        will complete DMLSS actions and forward inventory documentation to the AFRC
        unit for completion of the inventory. All actions will be completed within 30 days.
        (T-0: DODI 3020.52) The property custodian will maintain an MRDSS ULTRA
        account for assemblage oversight purposes. See AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics
        Support, for additional asset management guidance.
        3.2.4.7.3. Funding for 886H equipment/supplies and training is provided through PE
        58211F.
        3.2.4.7.4. Ensure personnel assigned to the Bioenvironmental Engineering response
        team designated to use 886H assets are trained based on command guidance and
        execution of AFTTP 3-42.32 for the 886H AS. (T-0: DODI 3020.52) Reference
        AFTTP 3-42.32 for specific MC-CBRN requirements and resources for obtaining
        training.
        3.2.4.7.5. All individuals in the AFRC full-time BE/PH office (e.g. where AFRC is
        the host installation) will be trained to respond using the 886H AS in accordance with
        Chapter 17 of AFTTP 3-42-32.               (T-2) The response force may consist of a
        combination of BE, public health, civil engineers, or other designated personnel.
        3.2.4.7.6. Individuals identified for response will also be trained to perform health
        risk assessments and to enter the warm/hot zone using Self-contained Breathing
        Apparatus (SCBA).
        3.2.4.7.7. MC-CBRN training will be tracked by the MR office in MRDSS ULTRA.
        3.2.4.7.8. Minimum AFRC non-collocated unit MC-CBRN response capabilities
        (where AFRC is host) will include:
            3.2.4.7.8.1. Providing the commander adequate information to make decisions -
            initial identification and basic assessment only. MOUs/MOAs/MAAs with the
            local community will provide additional capability.
AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014                                                                       41


              3.2.4.7.8.2. Responsibilities for biological samples will be to collect, package,
              ensure chain-of-custody, and transport.
   3.2.5. Medical Readiness Program Management Functions.           The following functions are
   also managed by the MR office:
       3.2.5.1. Medical Readiness Training. The Unit Medical Readiness Office coordinates,
       schedules, tracks and documents medical readiness training. (T-1) Units may appoint a
       Unit Medical Readiness Training Manager to provide a single point of contact for the
       performance of these functions. Reference Chapter 5 for detailed training information.
       3.2.5.2. Readiness In- and Out-processing. Conduct medical readiness in-processing and

           assignment and deployment requirements; MCRP team assignment; training
           requirements; names and duty sections of team chiefs and AFSC Functional Training
           Manager; and current training status.
           3.2.5.2.2. Establish standardized out-processing procedures for personnel
           permanently changing station, separating or retiring. Print out training data if
           necessary and provide the individual’s AFDF.
       3.2.5.3. Provide oversight and support to MCRP Team Chiefs. (T-2)
           3.2.5.3.1. Register MCRP team chiefs and assign team members using MRDSS
           ULTRA.
           3.2.5.3.2. Ensure team chiefs know their responsibilities, which include, but are not
           limited to: maintaining contact information for their team members; developing and
           maintaining team training lesson plans; ensuring their team members are trained and
           the training is documented in MRDSS ULTRA; obtaining, maintaining and
           inventorying team supplies and/or equipment; training team members on use of
           assigned supplies and/or equipment; reviewing and updating the team’s annex in the
           MCRP as well as supporting operational checklists. Include in all management
           activities MC-CBRN responsibilities and assets in accordance with AFI 41-209,
           Medical Logistics Support, and this Instruction.

3.3. Medical Readiness Decision Support System Unit Level Tracking and Reporting
Application (MRDSS ULTRA). MRDSS ULTRA provides enhanced global visibility of
medical materiel, personnel, and their training to allow for the efficient management and
deployment of those assets. MRDSS ULTRA is the official system of record for the
management of expeditionary medical personnel and resources for the AFMS and will be used
by the Medical Readiness Office. It is the single authoritative source of readiness training data
for medical personnel and UTC apportionment through the MRL. The governing directive for
MRDSS ULTRA is this Instruction.
42                                                                 AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014


  3.3.1. Access. Only authorized medical personnel and units, and others requiring access for
  official use, are granted access to MRDSS ULTRA. The data it contains will not be released
  nor provided outside the AFMS or supporting agencies without prior approval by appropriate
  level command authorities. The MRO/MRNCO/MRM and MRDSS ULTRA Unit System
  Administrator will contact the MAJCOM SGX POC to obtain an account, as well as
  MAJCOM-specific usage guidance. Other unit personnel, including E&T personnel and all
  MCRP team chiefs will contact the MRDSS ULTRA Unit System Administrator to obtain
  accounts. Note: The MRDSS Help Desk does not establish user accounts without
  authorization from MAJCOM or higher headquarters.
  3.3.2. Classification. The data contained within MRDSS ULTRA is for official use only
  (FOUO). Although it contains the raw statistical data used to compile classified operational
  readiness reports, it does not contain, report, collect, or display all the data elements for a
  UTC, nor does it include supporting remarks or allow for unit commander assessments of the
  ability of a UTC or MCRP team to perform its specific mission.
  3.3.3. Medical Resource Letter (MRL). The MRL, maintained within MRDSS, is the tool
  designed to manage AFMS readiness resources. Information provided in the MRL for a
  specific unit includes, but is not limited to: UTCs currently apportioned to the unit; UTCs the
  unit is projected to gain or lose over the next five years; whether assigned UTCs are
  manpower or equipment; AEF assignments for each UTC; UTC availability codes; and
  additional information for equipment UTCs. In addition, the MRL is utilized to manage the
  apportionment/distribution of MC-CBRN assemblages (886 AS), using pseudo UTCs
  HSMRA through HSMRP.
  3.3.4. Data Currency. The MR office will ensure the currency of MRDSS ULTRA data at
  all times and update it as events or changes occur. (T-2) Waivers for this requirement must
  be coordinated with the parent MAJCOM/SGX prior to submission, in accordance with AFI
  33-360. Updates include the following, at a minimum: annotating training events, UTC
  assignments, MCRP team assignments, DAV codes, and unit information such as contact
  information for medical readiness and medical logistics staff (phone numbers, e-mail
  addresses, classified communication device numbers, and 24-hour contacts).
  3.3.5. MRDSS ULTRA Functions. Units use MRDSS to:
     3.3.5.1. Assign appointed positions, such as MRO/NCO/MRM, UDM, Unit Functional
     Training Managers, etc.
     3.3.5.2. Assign personnel to UTCs and MCRP teams.
     3.3.5.3. Track readiness training completion including, but not limited to, UTC formal
     courses, MCRP team training and RSVP.
     3.3.5.4. Track personnel and WRM deployments.

   4.1.1. Special Planning Considerations.
        4.1.1.1. LS, LSISS, and deployed MTFs are not required to prepare an MCRP.
        However, these units will conduct a realistic assessment of their contingency response
        capabilities (including MC-CBRN) and incorporate them into the IEMP 10-2, or sister
        service equivalent. (T-2) ANG units will include 976 Program Elements, to include
        team composition, and training requirements, at a minimum. (T-2) Use the MCRP team
        annex guidance in table 4.1 as the framework for preparing the unit’s emergency/disaster
        response input, utilizing the established MCRP team names where applicable. Clearly
        identify MTF capabilities, roles and responsibilities in support of a collaborative
        installation response, including support provided via MOUs/MOAs/MAAs, as
        appropriate. Ensure assigned personnel are trained and record this training in MRDSS
        ULTRA utilizing existing MCRP team names. Local MCRP team training requirements
        may be added to allow for tracking of unit-unique training.
46                                                                 AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014


     4.1.1.2. ARC and Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) units collocated with an AC MTF are
     considered available medical resources and will be included in the AC MTF’s MCRP as
     such.
     4.1.1.3. Depending on local support available, particularly for OCONUS units, support
     may be provided by another AF MTF. When this is the case, support to be provided will
     be included in the supported IEMP 10-2 and be addressed in the supporting MTFs
     MCRP.
     4.1.1.4. Units will develop and maintain current medical emergency response checklists
     in support of installation plans, addressing unit control center activation, major accident
     response, natural disaster response, MC-CBRN response, and casualty management, at a
     minimum. (T-2) In addition, deployed MTFs will include attack response as a potential
     scenario.
     4.1.1.5. Units in multi-service or multi-unit areas, e.g. San Antonio or Colorado Springs,
     will develop an integrated MCRP, addressing a unified response to a city-wide event or
     incident as well as interaction between units and with local emergency management
     officials. (T-2)
  4.1.2. Medical Continuity of Operations (COOP). Medical COOP involves the evacuation
  and dispersal of patients from the MTF as rapidly and safely as possible, staging them in a
  pre-designated location and providing necessary medical care only until dispersal activities
  are complete. Medical COOP does not involve relocating vast amounts of supplies and
  personnel to an alternate location for the purpose of continuing routine patient care, although
  units that have the capacity or responsibility to continue to provide services to AD base
  populations may plan to do so.
     4.1.2.1. For Medical COOP, the core mission essential functions (MEF) to be addressed
     in the MCRP include: 1) medical command and control for the evacuation and dispersal;
     2) patient support, to include facility evacuation, dispersal, transportation, tracking, and
     pandemic response, at a minimum; 3) staff support, to include evacuation, dispersal, and
     accountability; 4) medical emergency response activities, to include critical installation
     support; 5) Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Information (C4I), to
     include relocation and continuity of medical command and control, as well as
     information sharing with beneficiaries, staff, and higher headquarters. Units may add
     additional MEFs based on their unique missions, capabilities, and beneficiary population
     needs. List and prioritize all MEFs in the MCRP.
     4.1.2.2. The Information Services Disaster Response Team (ISDRT) supports Medical
     COOP operations by reacting to disasters or downtime, preventing, and detecting data
     loss or compromise from further intrusion, recovering and maintaining IS, and
     coordinating with outside agencies to restore critical systems. Team responsibilities
     include assessing damage to IS hardware, software, and data; notifying various agencies
     (Air Force Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT), MAJCOM, Legal, Public
     Affairs, etc.) as required; ensuring the MTF meets current Information Operations
     Condition (INFOCON) levels checklists; denying access to or shutting down vulnerable
     systems; and maintaining and prioritizing a list of critical systems and associated
     administrators of those systems.
AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014                                                                         47


       4.1.2.3. See AFI 10-208, Air Force Continuity of Operations (COOP) Program, for
       additional non-medical specific guidance.
   4.1.3. Plan Coordination. All offices and agencies tasked to provide any kind of support in
   the MCRP must coordinate on the plan, specifically approving their roles and
   responsibilities. (T-2) Submit a copy of the draft MCRP to the parent MAJCOM/SGX for
   review after full coordination with applicable agencies and MRC/EMC approval, but prior to
   publication. Plan reviews will be accomplished by MAJCOM/SGXs within 60 days.
   Concurrence is implied if no comments from the MAJCOM are received within that period.
   4.1.4. Plan Review. Review the MCRP and supporting checklists annually for currency and
   make changes as necessary. (T-3) Coordinate changes with all affected agencies and
   distribute according to the original plan distribution. The MCRP will be rewritten when
   there is a significant mission change, or when the volume of changes exceeds 10% of the
   document (by page count). (T-2) Update the MCRP publication date in MRDSS ULTRA
   whenever the plan is re-published.
   4.1.5. Plan Distribution. Distribute copies of the MCRP and appropriate checklists to each
   office that plays a role in its execution. The MR office will maintain additional copies for
   transfer to the shelter, Medical Continuity of Operations (COOP) alternate command and
   control (C2) location, and the installation EOC, as applicable. (T-3) Provide a copy of the
   final published MCRP to the parent MAJCOM/SGX.
4.2. Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs), Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs), and
Mutual Aid Agreements (MAAs). Support to the MTF from off-base agencies must be
coordinated in writing, in the form of an MOU, MOA, or MAA, in accordance with AFI 25-201,
Support Agreements Procedures. (T-2) Do not duplicate existing agreements and contracts,
such as the TRICARE contract. Approval of the MOU/MOA/MAA constitutes agreement with
the plan contents, therefore an additional staff summary sheet is not required. If unable to obtain
coordination with an off-base agency, develop a memorandum for record (MFR) and attach all
correspondence (e-mails, memos, phone records, etc.) to document their attempts to gain formal
coordination.

                            MEDICAL READINESS TRAINING

5.1. Training Philosophy. All medical personnel must be fully trained to meet the task
requirements associated with home station and global operations. A list of training requirements
that may be met through attendance of formal courses, such as the Expeditionary Medical
Readiness Course (EMRC), Basic Expeditionary Medical Readiness Training (BEMRT) and
Commissioned Officer Training (COT), is provided on the Medical Readiness Training
Equivalency Matrix on the AF Medical Readiness SharePoint Site in the AFI 41-106 Toolbox.
   5.1.1. Initial Training. All Airmen, regardless of rank, fill a duty AFSC (DAFSC). Airmen
   are trained to initial proficiency upon entry into the Air Force, or join the Air Force with
   verifiable AFSC-specific credentials. Enlisted personnel receive initial medical readiness
   training through EMRC or BEMRT in conjunction with their AFSC-awarding courses.
   Officers receive initial medical readiness training as part of COT or Reserve Commissioned
   Officer Training (RCOT) courses, or through a commissioning program such as a service
   academy, Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) or Officer Training School (OTS).
   Curricula for these courses will provide the initial medical readiness training elements listed
   in Table 5.1., at a minimum.

  5.1.2. Collective Training. Collective Training is defined as the training of a group of
  Airmen, such as MCRP teams or UTCs on the performance of tasks performed as a whole.
  This includes multiple training platforms operating concurrently at the same place and time.
  5.1.3. Training Categories. Medical Readiness training requirements identified in this
  Instruction are grouped as Category I, II or III. Individual training requirements are
  classified as Category I and are required for all medical personnel, and in some cases
  assigned non-medical personnel, civilians, and contractors, regardless of their deployment
  status. Category II includes training required for medical personnel assigned to standard
  deployable UTCs. Medical personnel must complete all Category I and II training before
  entering their deployment vulnerability period. (T-0: DODI 1322.24) Completed training
  will remain current for the duration of the vulnerability period or associated deployment,
  regardless of duration. Category III consists of MCRP team training and is accomplished at
  the unit level for all assigned personnel.
  5.1.4. Limited Scope (LS) and Limited Scope with Inter-service Support (LSISS) MTFs.
  LS and LSISS MTFs will conduct Category III: Unit Training – MCRP Team Training,
  based on unit capabilities and support they are required to provide. (T-1) If the unit has
  personnel assigned to standard UTCs, Category I and II training is required for those
  individuals. Regardless of UTC of assignment, any LS and LSISS MTF personnel tasked to
  deploy will complete Category I and II training prior to deploying. ARC units are considered
  LS MTFs.
  5.1.5. Life Support Training. Personnel holding certain clinical AFSCs who are assigned to
  standard deployable UTCs may be required to maintain currency in Basic Life Support
  (BLS), Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS),
  National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT), Prehospital Trauma Life
  Support (PHTLS), or other life support training, in accordance with AFI 44-102, Medical
  Care Management.
     5.1.5.1. Required life support training must remain current throughout any projected
     deployment vulnerability period and will not lapse during a deployment. Training or
     certifications that are due to expire during an individual’s vulnerability period must be
     reaccomplished prior to entering the vulnerability period to ensure currency.
     5.1.5.2. Education and Training (E&T) office personnel will validate requirements for
     each specialty and track this training in MRDSS ULTRA. (T-1) Representatives from
     the E&T office will be given MRDSS ULTRA accounts for this purpose. Larger
     facilities may designate a second MRDSS ULTRA Unit System Administrator in the
     E&T office specifically to manage E&T accounts.
  5.1.6. Training While Deployed. Personnel are required to be fully trained prior to
  deployment. Therefore, deployed units are not expected to conduct medical readiness
  training. However, personnel should take full advantage of any training opportunities
  provided, to include joint training with coalition partners, sister services, host nation medical
  forces, and others. Upon return to home station, members may request credit for training
  accomplished during deployment in accordance with this Instruction.
  5.1.7. Personnel in Non-standard Training Situations.
 50                                                               AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014


      5.1.7.1. Interns, residents, students, including those enrolled in Health Professions
      Scholarship Program (HPSP) or other residency or internship programs, as well as
      personnel in fellowship training status, are exempt from medical readiness training unless
      tasked to deploy or assigned to a standard UTC or MCRP team. However, participation
      in local training and exercises is highly recommended when opportunities are available.
      5.1.7.2. Recognizing all medical personnel must maintain a baseline training standard,
      medical personnel assigned to non-medical units will complete the Category I
      requirements in this chapter, as well as specialized training for their unique medical
      missions. (T-1) MAJCOM/SGXs may facilitate training by pairing these units with a
      larger MTF, if necessary.
      5.1.7.3. Medical Institutional Force (IF) personnel (those assigned to higher
      headquarters, such as MAJCOMs and the Air Staff) will complete the Category I and
      Category II requirements identified in this chapter when assigned to a standard
      deployable UTC or tasked to deploy. Category III training is not required for IF
      personnel. A unit training monitor will be appointed to schedule, track and document
      staff training.
      5.1.7.4. Chaplain Service personnel assigned to an MTF are encouraged to participate in
      medical readiness training. The MR office will coordinate with the senior chaplain to
      schedule this training.
5.2. Training Documentation.
   5.2.1. MRDSS ULTRA. All medical readiness training, including equivalency training
   credit (as applicable) is documented in MRDSS ULTRA for:
      5.2.1.1. Assigned unit personnel, ensuring personnel deploying as substitutes outside
      their assigned UTCs receive required training for the tasked UTC. (T-2)
      5.2.1.2. IMAs that are attached to the unit. Assign IMAs to the FFAZZ Associate UTC
      in MRDSS ULTRA for tracking purposes. They will not count against unit training
      statistics.
      5.2.1.3. Other medical personnel on or off base who do not work within the medical
      facility (e.g. Squadron Medical Element (SME) personnel). These individuals should be
      tracked by associating their unit’s Personnel Accounting System Code (PASCODE) with
      the MTF within MRDSS ULTRA. For remotely located medical personnel (e.g.
      recruiters), the nearest MTF will assume responsibility for tracking their training. Doing
      so will not affect MTF training statistics. Obtain the PASCODE for the unit to be
      associated and contact the help desk for assistance. If coordination of training events or
      dates with these units is not successful, document associated communications in a
      memorandum for record. EXCEPTION: AF Special Operations Command (AFSOC)
      Operational Support Medicine (OSM) flights and AFSOC medical personnel assigned to
      Special Tactics Groups/Squadrons (STG/STS) track their own training in MRDSS
      ULTRA.
   5.2.2. Air Force Training Record (AFTR). Prior to an enlisted member’s deployment to an
   AF overseas contingency operation, the unit AFSC functional manager must review and print
   the member’s RSVP checklist and individual AF Form 1098 in MRDSS ULTRA, ensuring
AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014                                                                         51


   all training requirements have been completed and properly documented. (T-1) Upload
   these documents into the member's AFTR following the review. Upon the member's return
   to homestation, the functional manager will determine if any relevant training was
   accomplished during the deployment and, if so, document it in AFTR and upload any AF
   Form 1098s/AF Form 623a provided. (T-1)
5.3. Category I: Individual Training. Individual training is a broad categorization that
consists of core individual level training. Category I training begins and is counted in unit
training statistics upon personnel in-processing to their first duty station. Category I training
consists of the Readiness Skills Verification Program (RSVP), Sustainment of Trauma and
Resuscitation Skills Program (STARS-P), and CBRNE Emergency Preparedness and Response
Course (EPRC).
   5.3.1. Category I: Individual Training - RSVP. RSVP training applies to all individuals who
   hold a medical AFSC. It represents or establishes minimum baseline AFSC skills required to
   perform a critical task in a medical deployment environment. Personnel who are tasked to
   deploy in a non-medical (non-AFSC) capacity (e.g. staff liaison, TCN-duty, etc.) are not
   required to complete RSVP for their AFSC prior to deploying.
       5.3.1.1. RSVP training should begin as soon as personnel arrive at their first duty station,
       in accordance with guidance provided by the consultant, corps director or CFM for each
       specialty, with credit awarded as applicable for skills learned in technical training or
       professional education. For ARC units, RSVP training begins when an individual returns
       to the unit after completion of their 3-level AFSC-awarding technical school. Ideally,
       personnel should complete their RSVP training before they enter their deployment
       vulnerability period to ensure they are ready for deployment at any time. However,
       RSVP training must be complete and proficiency verified before the individual deploys.
       RSVP checklists can be accessed within MRDSS ULTRA or through the AF Medical
       Readiness SharePoint Site. The governing directive for RSVP is this Instruction.
       5.3.1.2. Personnel will complete RSVP training for their Control AFSC (CAFSC) for
       enlisted and Duty AFSC (DAFSC) for officers. (T-1) Waivers for this requirement must
       be coordinated with the AF/SG specialty consultant, corps director or CFM prior to
       submission, in accordance with AFI 33-360.
           5.3.1.2.1. Personnel who are utilized as authorized substitutes on a standard UTC
           must complete RSVP training for the AFSC they are filling on the UTC, as well as
           their own AFSC. (T-1) Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the specialty
           consultants, corps directors or CFMs of both AFSCs.
           5.3.1.2.2. For the Patient Decontamination Team, UTC FFGLB, authorized
           substitutes will complete RSVP training for their own AFSC only.
       5.3.1.3. Institutional Forces and personnel assigned to LS or LSISS MTFs may
       accomplish RSVP just-in-time (JIT), upon receipt of a deployment tasking, unless
       otherwise directed by the specialty consultant, corps director or CFM. However, all
       RSVP training is completed and proficiency verified prior to deployment.
       5.3.1.4. Contact the appropriate consultant, corps director or CFM to determine RSVP
       requirements for commanders on G series orders (non-temporary).
52                                                                 AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014


  5.3.2. Category I: Individual Training - STARS-P. STARS-P is designed to maintain the
  clinical currency of trauma and resuscitative skills of medical personnel assigned to specified
  MTFs by regular immersion in on-going clinical rotations at nearby civilian Level-1 trauma
  centers. By utilizing a core curriculum and advanced human patient simulators, teams may
  be trained and qualified at a STARS-P platform.
     5.3.2.1. STARS-P participants may include AFSCs listed on the C-STARS Training
     Matrix, as well as other eligible members assigned to the MTF.
     5.3.2.2. Participating personnel will regularly rotate through the STARS-P location
     throughout the year, unless they are deployed, TDY, or on leave. (T-1) Rotations will be
     considered part of normal duty.
     5.3.2.3. To provide currency, STARS-P platforms must provide minimum individual
     currency events and objectively evaluated team-based trauma resuscitation training and
     testing curriculum. Simulator facilities will be utilized for team-based trauma
     resuscitation and stabilization training, and for individual procedural-based skills
     training, when the procedure is not completed during ward rotations.
     5.3.2.4. Individuals who are required to attend C-STARS and are actively participating
     in STARS-P programs will apply for a C-STARS exemption every 24 months. (T-1)
     5.3.2.5. STARS-P is not an authorized substitute for the CCATT Advanced Course
     required for FFCCE, FFCCN, FFCCT, or FFQE4 personnel. These members must
     follow requirements prescribed in this Instruction.
     5.3.2.6. STARS-P participation will be documented in MRDSS ULTRA.
  5.3.3. Category I: Individual Training - CBRNE EPRC. CBRNE EPRC is required for all
  DOD medical personnel as well as all non-medical personnel working in or assigned to an
  MTF. AFMS new accessions are required to accomplish CBRNE EPRC within 12 months of
  arriving at their first duty station. Sustainment training must be completed every 36 months.
  (T-0: ASD HA Policy Memo, 9 Jan 04) Depending on an individual’s AFSC and duties,
  they will complete one or more of the four CBRNE EPRC courses described below and
  ensure that their training is documented in MRDSS ULTRA. The requirements for
  completing Medical Effects of NBC Warfare and Threat and Future Battlefield training
  prescribed in DODI 1322.24, Medical Readiness Training, as well as Depleted Uranium
  training are met through completion of Clinician/Provider or Operator/Responder CBRNE
  EPRC.       CBRNE EPRC is accomplished on Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) at:
  https://jkodirect.jten.mil.
     5.3.3.1. Clinician/Provider Course. This course is required for all personnel with a
     physician, nurse, dentist, physician assistant or IDMT primary AFSC (PAFSC).
     5.3.3.2. Executive/Commander Course. This course is required for personnel filling a C-
     prefix (commander), or having a 40C0 or 9G100 (group superintendent) duty AFSC.
     Personnel will be granted credit for the Executive/Commander course if they have
     completed either the Clinician/Provider or Operator/Responder courses, as appropriate
     for their PAFSC. Individuals in these roles do not have to take another EPRC course
     until/unless they are reassigned to a non-command position. Once reassigned, they must
     also complete the course appropriate for their AFSC within 120 days of reassignment.
AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014                                                                          53


       Unit Medical Readiness Training Managers will ensure commanders’ duty AFSCs are
       appropriately entered in MRDSS ULTRA and updated as necessary.
       5.3.3.3. Operator/Responder Course. This course is required for all personnel holding a
       medical PAFSC who do not meet the criteria in paragraph 5.3.3.1. for the
       Clinician/Provider and Executive/Commander courses. Personnel assigned to the MR
       office must also take the Operator/Responder course, regardless of their PAFSC.
       5.3.3.4. Basic Course. This course is required for all personnel holding a non-medical
       AFSC (e.g. 3S2XX, 8F0XX) but working in a medical unit or medical staff position.
       5.3.3.5. Medical Civilian and Contractor Personnel. Civilian and contractor personnel
       will take the same course(s) as military members in their positions. For example, a
       contractor dentist would complete the Clinician/Provider course. Training for these
       individuals is also tracked in MRDSS ULTRA.
5.4. Category II: Deployment Training. Category II training includes UTC-specific training
and human remains preservation training. Additional training, such as Medical Ethics and
Detainee Operations Training may be required for some deployers through deployment line
remarks. Course descriptions and guidance are provided below. Medical-specific information
regarding the Law of Armed Conflict is provided in Attachment 2 of this Instruction and should
be used to supplement Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) training accomplished through the
Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS) per AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.
   5.4.1. Category II: Deployment Training – UTC-Specific Training. Personnel assigned to
   deployable UTCs will complete UTC-specific training in accordance with the following
   paragraphs. In the case where a member has an opportunity to participate in a sustainment
   training platform, prior to attendance at the formal/initial course, UTC-specific training credit
   may be requested through the parent MAJCOM/SGX to the appropriate MRA/SGX for
   approval. Personnel granted such credit must attend the UTC formal course during their next
   training cycle.
       5.4.1.1. Personnel who are not assigned to a standard deployable UTC but are tasked to
       deploy in a standard UTC, must complete UTC-specific training for the tasked UTC
       position. (T-0: DODI 1322.24)
       5.4.1.2. Credit for UTC formal training is provided only by attending the UTC formal
       courses. For UTCs that do not have UTC-specific courses, training will consist of
       reviewing the UTC Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), Mission Capability
       Statements (MISCAPS), Mission Essential Task Lists (METLs), and allowance standards
       (AS) every 24 months. (T-2)
       5.4.1.3. UTC sustainment training is accomplished between formal course attendance
       cycles and is designed to keep UTC members’ skills current.
       5.4.1.4. UTC-specific course curricula will include the medical readiness training
       elements listed in Table 5.2. at a minimum, in accordance with DoDI 1322.24, Medical
       Readiness Training.
 54                                                                  AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014

      Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Best Practices are required for First
      Receivers/Responders, as applicable to each MCRP team, and the didactic portion is
      available on Med+Learn and required annually unless otherwise noted. This HAZMAT
      training is implemented in the AFMS as follows:
          5.5.1.1.1. Enhanced First Responder Awareness: This training is the HAZMAT First
          Responder Awareness course that is designed specifically for the Field Response
          Team and ambulance drivers.
AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014                                                                     61


        5.5.1.1.2. First Receiver Awareness: This training is the HAZMAT First Responder
        Awareness course modified for medical first receivers. This training is required for
        all personnel who work in the medical facility in support of patient care and may have
        contact with contaminated victims, their belongings, equipment, or waste. This
        includes administrative and ancillary support personnel who work in duty sections
        that may be first to identify a contaminated patient, such as a door greeter or
        receptionist. The MTF commander may use discretion in deciding if personnel who
        aren’t likely to come in contact with patients, require this training. BE team
        personnel are not required to accomplish this training.
        5.5.1.1.3. Combined First Receiver Awareness and Operations Training: This
        training is the combined HAZMAT First Receiver Awareness and Operations course.
        This training is required for all personnel who have a designated role in or around the
        decontamination zone outside the medical facility. Members need to successfully
        complete both the didactic and hands-on training with the PPE to meet the initial
        training requirements. Annual requirements can be met with a demonstration of
        competencies through participation in an exercise, tactical drill or real-world
        response.
        5.5.1.1.4. HAZMAT First Responder Operations: All Bioenvironmental Engineering
        team personnel require HAZMAT Operations level training and DoD certification.
     5.5.1.2. Specialized MCRP Team Training: Some MCRP teams have unique training to
     support their mission requirements. These teams and their unique training are provided
     below.
        5.5.1.2.1. Patient Decontamination Team: The Patient Decontamination Team Chief
        and NCOIC will attend and successfully complete the Patient Decontamination
        Course (L3ORP4XXX 00DA) one-time only, within six months of assignment. (T-
        1) Within 90-days of completion of the course, the team chief and NCOIC will train
        the remaining team members using the MCRP patient decontamination assemblage,
        AS 886A, every 12 months. (T-1) Note: For team chiefs and NCOICs stationed at
        remote locations, attendance of the course is not required as long as they are trained
        locally by an individual who has attended the formal course. This training must occur
        within 30 days of assignment. If no formally trained individual is available, the team
        chief and NCOIC must attend the formal course. Training can be also accomplished
        through other courses, as approved by HQ ACC/SGX.
        5.5.1.2.2. Laboratory Biological Detection Team (LBDT): Laboratory teams
        maintaining JBAIDS, M1M, or both capabilities will have at least 2 members of the
        team current in the requirements for each platform maintained. (T-1) Requirements
        for each platform include both completion of the respective JBAIDS and M1M
        formal courses and currency in the corresponding proficiency/competency program.
        Formal course attendance is a one-time requirement. Proficiency testing must be
        accomplished every 12 months by each member. Note: testing occurs 3 times each
        year.
     5.5.1.3. Respiratory Protection: All MCRP teams required to utilize respiratory
     protection will comply with the requirements of AFOSH Std. 48-137, Respiratory
     Protection Program, as applicable. (T-0: 29 CFR 1910.134)
 62                                                                AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014


      5.5.1.4. Air Force Emergency Management Program Course (AFEMPC): All MCRP
      team members will complete the AFEMPC every three years. (T-2)
5.6. Training Equivalency.
   5.6.1. Exercises. Sustainment training credit may be granted for locally-sponsored UTC
   Mission Essential Task-driven exercises with prior MRA approval. Local exercises must use
   UTC equipment packages to qualify for sustainment credit. A list of exercises the MRA has
   approved for sustainment credit may be found on the applicable MRA’s SharePoint Site. An
   after action report defining personnel and equipment UTCs participating in the exercise and a
   list of participants must be sent to the approving MRA. For exercises not listed, requests for
   credit should be submitted to the appropriate MRA no later than 60 days prior to the start
   date. Once an exercise is approved for sustainment training credit by the MRA, training
   participation will be verified by the MR office and updated in MRDSS ULTRA using the
   exercise end date as the training completion date.
   5.6.2. Deployments.
      5.6.2.1. Members may request UTC sustainment training credit for participation in real
      world operations and/or deployments. Members who have deployed and performed
      duties consistent with their assigned UTC, utilizing the UTC’s assigned war reserve
      materiel (WRM) equipment assemblages in an expeditionary (Bare Base) environment
      may request UTC sustainment training credit. Requests will be forwarded to the
      appropriate MRA for approval. If approved, the deployment return date will be used as
      the training completion date.
      5.6.2.2. Members may request GRL equivalency credit for real world operations and/or
      deployments. Members who have deployed 14 days or more to an austere environment
      in a 48 month period and have performed duties consistent with deployment as GRL or
      Preventive Medicine Team (FFPM1/2) may request credit for specific training
      requirements. Requests will be forwarded to HQ AMC/SGX who will coordinate
      approval/disapproval with HQ AMC/SGP. If approved, the deployment return date will
      be used as the training completion date.
AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014                                                                         63

                                MEDICAL UNIT EXERCISES

6.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on base-level exercise planning roles and
responsibilities, exercise types, requirements, and documentation. Additional information is
provided in the AF Medical Readiness Guide.
6.2. Special Exercise Considerations.
   6.2.1. LS and LSISS MTFs will work with their wing/base/installation IG (or equivalent) to
   determine the best way to conduct exercises required by other AFIs or directives. MTFs will
   combine their exercises with sister service or wing/base/installation exercises to the greatest
   extent possible. Exercise scenarios must be developed collaboratively to test medical
   response capabilities as they would realistically be employed. In addition, LS and LSISS
   MTFs will conduct each of the following recall types annually: emergency/disaster response
   teams, UTCs, deployment support team(s), and one unit-wide recall. The unit-wide recall
   may alternate between telephonic only and report-to-duty each year and may be combined
   with other exercises, as appropriate. (T-2)
   6.2.2. LSISS MTFs may also be required to participate in host unit/service exercises.
   6.2.3. Deployed MTFs should participate in the host wing/base/installation’s exercise
   program, as mission requirements permit, especially major accident response. Deployed
   MTFs are not expected to plan or conduct large-scale exercises on their own; however,
   deployed MTFs must conduct a unit-wide recall, or personnel accountability exercise, every
   three months.
6.3. Required Exercises. Exercise requirements are governed by AFI 90-201 (see Table 5.1 for
exercise frequency and governing directive), this Instruction and other directives. Non-medical
exercise requirements may be met by participating in wing/installation exercises. If the
wing/installation does not accomplish all non-medical exercises, the medical unit is not expected
to accomplish them independently. However, if wing exercises that are conducted do not
adequately test the medical unit’s capabilities (for example, the exercise stops at the entrance to
the medical facility), units will develop internal scenarios to supplement or extend the exercise.
The following medical-specific exercises are mandated by this Instruction:
   6.3.1. Recalls. Recall exercises demonstrate the unit’s ability to return to duty in response to
   a contingency situation. Acceptable response standards are generally established by the
   wing. If no wing standard exists, the MRC must establish the standard and include it in
   Annex A of the MCRP. Conduct each of the following recall types at least once annually:
   MCRP Teams, UTCs, deployment support teams, and one unit-wide recall. The unit-wide
   recall may alternate between telephonic only and report-to-duty each year and may be
   combined with other exercises, as appropriate. (T-2)
   6.3.2. Medical Emergency Response Exercises. Units that publish MCRPs are required to
   exercise each annex annually, in conjunction with wing/installation exercises or conducted
   separately at the unit level. (T-0: The Joint Commission (TJC) Standards) At the
   commander’s discretion, annexes may be exercised together, as part of a comprehensive
   exercise, as functionally appropriate to support realistic scenarios and response. Units that
 64                                                                  AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014


   do not publish MCRPs, but provide input to the IEMP 10-2 or sister service equivalent IEM
   plans, must also exercise this capability annually. Emergency response exercises will include
   an influx from outside the organization of volunteer or simulated casualties. Enough
   casualties should be used to adequately test the organization's resources and reactions under
   stress.
6.4. Exercise Credit. Medical units may take exercise credit for real world response of similar
scope and magnitude to the exercise intent of plan activation and modification of the normal use
of services, equipment, staff, and normal patient management procedures. For example, a
response to a bus accident with multiple casualties utilizing numerous MCRP teams may satisfy
a major accident exercise requirement. The same post-event procedures, such as a post-incident
hot wash and PIES, as well as MRC/EMC review must occur for real world incidents. Credit
may be taken only when objectives are met for the specific exercise type or subsequent
corrective action is successful.
6.5. Post-Incident/Exercise Summary (PIES). Medical units will generate a PIES for each
exercise they participate in, regardless of which agency conducted the exercise. The PIES is
compiled by the MR office within 30 days of the incident or event, with input from participating
team chiefs, observers and evaluators. (T-0: The Joint Commission (TJC) Standards) PIES
document the unit’s participation in an actual incident or exercise as well as individual
participation for appointed positions that require regular exercise participation. It describes the
scenario, exercise objectives, and whether or not they were met and addresses the effectiveness
of associated MCRP annexes and team checklists.
   6.5.1. PIES will include the following items, at a minimum:
       6.5.1.1. Incident/Exercise Overview. Include the date(s) and location(s) as well as the
       number and types of casualties, type of incident/exercise, and a list of participating teams,
       organizations, and key individuals, as applicable.
       6.5.1.2. Exercise Objectives. List objectives established for the exercise.
       6.5.1.3. Exercise Results/Achievement of Objectives. This section should address how
       each participating MCRP team’s involvement contributed to the achievement of the
       defined exercise objectives. Include a list of any Defense Readiness Reporting System
       (DRRS) Mission Essential Tasks (METs) tested as part of the exercise.
       6.5.1.4. Findings and Observations. Include both in-house items as well as medical unit
       items identified at the installation level.
       6.5.1.5. Recommended Changes to Checklists and Plans. Identify required changes or
       updates to the MCRP or IEMP (or equivalent for LSISS MTFs) and supporting
       checklists. An OPR and suspense for completion will be determined by the MRC/EMC
       and must be documented in the minutes.
       6.5.1.6. Exercise Requirements Fulfilled. List the exercise requirements met by the
       event. This is particularly important when different exercise types are combined.
   6.5.2. PIES will be reviewed by the MRC/EMC and attached to the meeting minutes.
   Identified findings, observations and areas of concern will be discussed, identified as open
   items, assigned OPRs, and tracked through the MRC/EMC until resolved.
AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014                                                              65


  6.5.3. A sample PIES can be found in the AFI 41-106 Toolbox, located on the AF Medical
  Readiness SharePoint Site.
 66                                                                  AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014


                                           Chapter 7

                           MEDICAL READINESS REPORTING

7.1. Operational Readiness Reports. Operational readiness reports provide higher
headquarters and other interested organizations, up to and including the Office of the Secretary
of Defense and National Command Authority, necessary information to make critical decisions
with regard to deployments, manpower, and resource requirements. The first three reporting
systems described below are populated and updated at the unit level each month, giving
commanders the opportunity to assess and report their unit capabilities. The remaining reporting
processes are accomplished as needed to relay vital information to higher headquarters before,
during or after a deployment or major event, as directed in this Instruction and referenced
governing directives.
   7.1.1. Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS). GSORTS, also known
   simply as SORTS, is a JCS owned system used to measure and report the status of a unit’s
   resources and training required to undertake the full scope of its mission.
       7.1.1.1. For SORTS training calculations, medical units will report only on formal UTC
       course attendance and associated sustainment training, as listed in Table 7.1 of this
       Instruction, using the TRSA1 field for the lowest training platform percentage, as
       provided by MRDSS ULTRA. (T-0: DoDI 7730.66, CJCSI 3401.02B, AFPD 10-2,
       CJCSM 3150.01, CJCSI 3401.02) All other readiness training, including MCRP team
       training, will be considered in the unit’s DRRS ESORTS assessments, as described in
       paragraph 7.1.2. below. Note: Medical units do not report equipment condition (R-levels)
       in SORTS.
       7.1.1.2. Units with fragmented (shared/split) UTCs will report only on their own
       portion(s) of the UTC in SORTS.
       7.1.1.3. Overall guidance for SORTS reporting is provided in AFI 10- 201.
   7.1.2. Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) Enhanced Status of Resources and
   Training System (ESORTS). DRRS ESORTS focuses on the full scope of the unit’s core
   mission capabilities assessed against mission essential tasks (METs), which are informed by
   SORTS resource ratings and ART readiness assessments. For Air Force medical units this
   includes, but is not limited to, all expeditionary or deployable missions (UTCs), as well as all
   in-place/generation missions, such as support for installation deployment processing, medical
   emergency response, fixed ERPS facilities, etc. Utilize the unit’s Medical Resource Letter
   (MRL) and the medical UTC-MET list provided in the Readiness Reporting-DRRS folder on
   the AF Medical Readiness SharePoint Site to determine which METs to assess. Medical unit
   commanders will assess unit mission capabilities in accordance with AFI 10-252, and the
   following: (T-0: DoDI 7730.66, CJCSI 3401.02B, AFPD 10-2, CJCSM 3150.01, CJCSI
   3401.02)
           7.1.2.1.1. For deployment missions, consider the deployability, availability, and
           training of personnel assigned to applicable UTCs, and critical percentages for
           assigned contingency materiel. For assemblages that do not have critical items, use
           the readiness percentage. Contingency materiel maintained for other units will be
           assessed by the “owning/using” units, rather than the “host/maintaining” units.
AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014                                                                       67


         7.1.2.1.2. Reporting medical units will assess their in-place/generation/homeland
         response missions using AFOP 4.4.3.6; refer to the MCRP (IEMP 10-2 or equivalent
         IEM plan for LS and LSISS MTFs) to determine which performance measures apply.
         Consider all assigned unit personnel, to include military members, civilians, and
         contractors, and their required training (e.g. MCRP team training), when assessing
         mission capability. Consult available resources such as the MRC, EMC, MCRP team
         chiefs, as well as PIES and inspection results to facilitate the mission assessment.
         7.1.2.1.3. For units supporting Named Operations or Top Priority (or Level IV)
         plans, assess the unit’s capabilities using the AFMS Core METL, deleting METs and
         performance measures the unit is not specifically tasked to provide in support of those
         operations or plans.
         7.1.2.1.4. Units with more than one “copy” of a UTC will assess the mission as a
         whole. For example, Constant Deployer Model (CDM) sites with multiple copies of
         FFEP2 will assess one EMEDS command and control, administration, medical
         information systems and medical logistics support (FFEP2) mission capability.
         7.1.2.1.5. For units with fragmented (shared/split) UTCs, the parent/supported unit
         assesses the fragmented mission capability as a whole in DRRS. Child/supporting
         units (those providing manpower to another unit’s UTCs) will not assess their
         portion(s) of that capability in DRRS.
         7.1.2.1.6. If SORTS ratings do not align with DRRS ESORTS assessment levels (e.g.
         SORTS is C-2 or C-3 and DRRS is Y) provide a unit mission assessment comment
         explaining the different ratings and rationale in layman’s terms. Acceptable DRRS
         unit mission assessment comments might address SORTS training shortfalls as
         trainable just-in-time should the unit be required to execute the mission, or a shortage
         of contingency materiel that is obtainable through local purchase or other logistics
         channels on a contingency basis.
     7.1.2.2. Once the AFMS Core METL template has been copied to the unit’s DRRS
     ESORTS, non-applicable METs and performance measures may be deleted after
     obtaining MAJCOM FAM approval. Update the unit’s core METL in DRRS ESORTS
     anytime the unit’s MRL and/or mission changes only by copying applicable METs from
     the AFMS Core METL. (T-0: DoDI 7730.66, CJCSI 3401.02B, AFPD 10-2, CJCSM
     3150.01, CJCSI 3401.02) Units will make no other alterations or modifications to the
     AFMS Core METL within DRRS, but may submit recommendations for updates or
     changes to the AFMS Core METL to the parent MAJCOM FAM.
     7.1.2.3. Reference AFI 10-252, Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS), for
     additional guidance.
  7.1.3. AEF Reporting Tool (ART). ART supplements SORTS data by providing
  commander assessed ratings for each individual assigned UTC, versus the unit as a whole. It
  provides a picture of a specific UTC’s ability to perform its mission as defined in the UTC
  MISCAP.
     7.1.3.1. ART uses the same measured resource areas as SORTS, but enables
     commanders to report the ability of an individual UTC to perform its mission at the time
     of the assessment.
 68                                                                  AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014


       7.1.3.2. Medical units with fragmented (shared/split) UTCs will provide an assessment
       of their own portion(s) of the UTC in ART. (T-0: DoDI 7730.66, CJCSI 3401.02B,
       AFPD 10-2, CJCSM 3150.01, CJCSI 3401.02)
       7.1.3.3. Overall guidance on preparing and submitting ART reports is provided in AFI
       10-244, Reporting Status of Aerospace Expeditionary Forces.
7.2. Reportable Medical Readiness Training. Although individual training items listed in
Table 7.1 may be applicable to a broader range of UTCs or personnel, they are only reportable
for personnel assigned to the UTCs listed. For SORTS T-level calculations, units will report
only the lowest percentage of all the applicable training platforms listed in Table 7.1. in the
TRSA1 field, using the reportable statistics report in MRDSS ULTRA.

Table 7.1. Medical Reportable Training (AD & ARC).

7.3. Readiness Reports for Deployed MTFs. Deployed MTFs should follow Component
Numbered Air Force (C-NAF) instructions for submitting updates on operational readiness
status, resource availability, and patient care capabilities during contingency operations. Reports
will be tailored based on the operational environment and submitted as directed to support
critical information flow to higher headquarters.
7.4. Medical Input to the Wing/Installation Operational Reports. In-garrison AF medical
units influenced by unusual occurrences (e.g., natural disasters, CBRN incidents, major accident
response, or other emergencies) will submit input to installation reports, such as Commander’s
Situation Report (SITREP) and Air Force Operational Reports (AF OPREP-3), to provide critical
updates on unit operating status to HHQ, as appropriate. Reports are submitted in accordance
with AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. In addition, whenever medical input to a SITREP or
OPREP-3 is submitted, send a notification copy via e-mail to the unit’s parent MAJCOM/SGX.
For medical logistics issues, include a courtesy copy to the Air Force Medical Logistics
Operations Center.
AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014                                                                           69


  7.4.1. Disease/Public Health Emergencies. A disease/public health emergency is defined as:
  an occurrence or imminent threat of an illness or health condition, caused by biological
  warfare or terrorism, epidemic or pandemic disease that poses a substantial risk of generating
  a significant number of human casualties; a medical situation involving a marked increase of
  disease among AF personnel, or any impending significant disease incident which has the
  potential to negatively impact mission accomplishment (see OPREP-3B, Rule 13A).
  7.4.2. Pandemic Events. Pandemic events reported include: initial confirmed novel
  pandemic disease case within a command (e.g. installation) or military medical treatment
  facility (MTF); initial confirmed cluster (2 - 5 cases) suggestive of novel pandemic disease
  for the period covered by the report; significant mission impact (actual) resulting from
  pandemic disease outbreak; pandemic disease causing an adverse impact to allocated
  Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) forces or to anticipated DSCA missions; other
  pandemic disease related incidents of significant interest as determined by the reporting
  organization; or very seriously ill/death(s) due to pandemic involving active duty personnel,
  civilians, or dependents (see OPREP-3B, Rule 13B).
  7.4.3. Significant MTF Events. Significant MTF events include: a natural disaster or other
  emergency (e.g., tornado, fire, terrorist attack, civil disturbance, etc.) that affects the medical
  unit’s normal operations, capabilities, or otherwise impairs the unit’s ability to carry out its
  mission. Inputs are submitted to provide status updates on completed actions under a
  previously declared stage of alert or emergency, as directed by higher headquarters or by
  actions required in response to a natural disaster or other emergency on the installation,
  where such response impairs the medical unit’s mission capability. Significant MTF event
  submissions are processed through the installation commander as HHQ AF Interest Level
  items, in accordance with the AF OPREP-3 Matrix (see OPREP-3B, Rule 3A or Rule 3E).

Terms
Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)—AE provides timesensitive en route care of regulated casualties
to and between medical treatment facilities using organic and/or contracted aircraft with medical
aircrew trained explicitly for that mission. AE forces can operate as far forward as aircraft are
able to conduct air operations, across the full range of military operations, and in all operating
environments. Specialty medical teams may be assigned to work with the AE aircrew to support
patients requiring more intensive en route care.
Annual Training—A training period related to the calendar year. Training required on an
annual basis must be accomplished every calendar year, but not exactly every twelve months,
e.g., an individual who attends an annual training event on 1 Jan 2009 is current until 31 Dec
2010.
AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014                                                                        79


Community Recovery—The process of assessing the effects of an Incident of National
Significance, defining resources, and developing and implementing a course of action to restore
and revitalize the socioeconomic and physical structure of a community.
Core requirements—Those essential individual training requirements needed to accomplish the
AFMS mission.
Critical Infrastructure—Systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the US that
the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on
security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of
those matters.
Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA)—Refers to DOD support, including Federal
military forces, DOD civilians and DOD contractor personnel, and DOD agencies and
components, for domestic emergencies, and for designated law enforcement and other activities.
Disease Prevention—Encompasses the anticipation, prediction, identification, prevention, and
control of preventable diseases, illnesses, and injuries caused by exposure to biological,
chemical, physical or psychological threats or stressors found at home station and during
deployments.
Emergency Operations Center (EOC)—The physical location at which the coordination of
information and resources to support domestic incident management activities normally takes
place. An EOC may be located in a permanent or temporary location. EOCs may be organized
by major functional disciplines (fire, law enforcement, medical services, etc.), by jurisdiction
(Federal, State, regional, county, city, tribal), or by some combination.
Emergency Responders (medical)—Disaster Response Force members who deploy after first
responders and provide additional support. They include follow on medical personnel including
additional ambulances, physicians, nurses, technicians, and other specialized teams. Teams such
as radiology, laboratory, pharmacy, surgery, and nutritional medicine would not ordinarily leave
the facility and are therefore not considered emergency responders. Examples of MCRP teams
in the emergency responder category would be the Field Response Team, Triage Team, the
Public Health Team, and the Nursing Services Team.
Emergency Support Function—A grouping of government and certain private sector
capabilities into an organizational structure to provide the support, resources, program
implementation, and services to help communities recover following domestic incidents.
Federal Coordinating Center (FCC)—A facility located in a metropolitan area of the United
States, and Puerto Rico, responsible for day—to-day coordination of planning and operations in
one or more assigned geographic NDMS Patient Reception Areas (PRA). Note: The main
difference between the FCC and the Primary Receiving Center (PRC) mission is FCCs
coordinate planning, training, exercising, and operations of one or more NDMS PRAs. PRCs
receive; triage, stage, transport, and track patients affected by a disaster to participating NDMS
inpatient hospitals capable of providing the required definitive care.
Installation Medical Response—Term that encompasses the full spectrum of installation
medical response activities, including medical contingency response, WMD response, MC—
CBRN response, home station medical response, defense support to civil authorities, civil
support, and disaster response.
 80                                                                   AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014


The Joint Commission—Previously called the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations. The name change reflects the Joint Commission’s continuing efforts
to improve the value of accreditation and its utility as a mechanism for improving the quality and
safety of patient care in all organizations.
Just—In-Time (JIT) Training—Training that augments core requirements and occurs in
conjunction with activities in support of expeditionary and all hazards response operations.
Training is normally time sensitive and usually limited to that period of time that immediately
precedes the activity, deployment or function.
Patient Reception Area (PRA)—A geographic locale containing one or more airfields, bus
stations, or airfields; adequate patient staging facilities; and adequate local patient transport
assets to support patient reception and transport to pre—identified, non-Federal, acute care
NDMS hospitals capable of providing definitive care for victims of a domestic disaster,
emergency, or military contingency. Generally, these hospitals are within a 50 mile radius.
Primary Receiving Center (PRC)—A Military Treatment Facility (MTF) or VA Medical
Center (VAMC) designated for coordinating and/or providing treatment to sick and wounded
military personnel returning from armed conflict or national emergency. The main difference
between the FCC and the PRC mission is FCC’s coordinate planning, training, exercising and
operations of one or more NDMS Patient Reception Areas. FCCs receive; triage, stage, transport
and track already inpatients affected by a disaster to participating NDMS inpatient hospitals
capable of providing the required definitive care. The patients will more than likely not be
eligible for care in a Federal treatment facility. The mission of a PRC is to receive and treat sick
and wounded military personnel returning from armed conflict or national emergency.
Patient Reception Team (PRT)—A multifunction group consisting mainly of clinical staff, but
also including appropriate support from medical administration, communications, logistics,
litter-bearers, drivers, etc., to support the NDMS mission. The team may consist of military
and/or civilian personnel, depending on the local FCC. The mission of the PRT is to receive,
sort, triage, and care for patients as they arrive at the PRA awaiting distribution to NDMS
hospitals. The PRT regulates and transports patients to area NDMS hospitals and monitors
NDMS patients’ status, location, care, and costs then assists returning patients back to home or
duty station
Secondary Support Center (SSC)—Military Treatment Facility (MTF) or VA Medical Center
(VAMC) designated to accept transfers from, or sharing resources with, a Primary Receiving
Center (DOD or VA Only) to maximize health care services support to the DOD.
Sustainment Training—Training required to maintain or enhance the proficiency of individual
readiness, clinical, and unit/platform skills.
Training Cycle—That period of time, as defined by each service component, in which all
mandatory medical readiness training must be completed. The Air Force training cycle currently
coincides with the AEF cycle.
Wound and Casualty Management—Wound management refers to those medical skills that
are needed to care for trauma and disease non battle injury patient conditions. Casualty
management refers to those skills that are needed to triage and regulate casualties, to include land
and air medical evacuation, and staging.
AFI41-106 22 APRIL 2014                                                                      81


                                        Attachment 2
                 APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT

A2.1. General. As a matter of Air Force policy, medical personnel may deploy as either
noncombatants or combatants. The protections afforded under the Geneva Conventions are
different for each category, and therefore, medical personnel should verify their status and the
consequences of that status prior to deployment.
A2.2. Noncombatants. Medical personnel are considered noncombatants if they are exclusively
engaged in performing medical duties. This includes supporting duties such as medical records,
administration, disease prevention, and the variety of missions performed by Bioenvironmental
Engineering personnel for the purposes of prevention of disease/sickness through health risk
assessment and control. Noncombatants may carry weapons for self-defense, defense of
patients, or defense of other noncombatants such as their co-workers. However, medical
personnel may not engage in actions that are harmful to lawful enemy combatants, such as
offensive military operations, convoy operations, or laying minefields, without losing their
noncombatant status for the duration of their deployment and subjecting themselves to being
targeted by the enemy. If captured, true non-combatants are considered retained personnel and
not prisoners of war.
A2.3. Combatants. Medical personnel may deploy as combatants and as such are prohibited
from appearing as noncombatants while deployed in a combatant capacity. This means that
while serving in a combatant role:
   A2.3.1. Medical personnel may not wear the large red cross armband.
   A2.3.2. Medical personnel may not carry the DD Form 1934, Geneva Conventions
   Identification Card.
   A2.3.3. Medical personnel are not entitled to special protection against enemy attacks. (In
   this scenario, medical personnel are lawful targets.)
   A2.3.4. Upon capture, medical personnel in combatant roles are considered prisoners of war
   rather than retained personnel. However, the capturing force may elect to use the captured
   medical personnel in their medical capacity instead. In that event, the medical personnel
   would be entitled to the same treatment as retained personnel.
A2.4. Disclaimer. This section is not intended to answer all of the possible scenarios for
medical-legal issues relating to combatants and noncombatants. The Air Force Judge Advocate
General should be consulted for answers to specific questions. Also, AF/JAO has published
specific legal reviews for medical personnel and those documents should be reviewed (see
AF/JAO Memorandums dated 08 Sep 08 at on the AF Medical Readiness SharePoint Site
assessable through the AF Portal.

                 MC-CBRN ALLOWANCE STANDARD REQUIREMENTS

A3.1. MC-CBRN AS: The teams listed in Table A3.2 have additional material requirements
necessary to support MC-CBRN response capabilities exceeding those provided during normal
day-to-day operations. The respective MCRP team chiefs are responsible for maintaining
assigned MC-CBRN materiel in accordance with AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics Support, and
guidance provided by HQ ACC. These assets must be stored in ready status and in locations that
are easily accessible during duty and non-duty hours. (T-2) Note: Applicable allowance
standard packages listed in Table A3.1 below provide a baseline capability which can be tailored
based on local mission, vulnerabilities, etc.
