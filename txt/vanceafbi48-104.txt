   RSO is responsible for ensuring this is posted.
   4.7. Storage, disposal, and transfer of RAM shall be accomplished according to the permit.
   Additional information is provided in this instruction, and questions should be referred to the
   BEE.
5. Use of RAM and Devices which Produce Radiation: RAM and devices which produce
ionizing radiation shall be used according to established operating procedures and technical
orders. Supervisors shall establish operating procedures if they do not exist. All locally
developed operating procedures shall be approved by the base RSO before implementation.
Deviation from these procedures could result in exposures to radiation that is not ALARA.
   5.1. Exposure to ionizing radiation shall be minimized to an ALARA level when using RAM
   or devices that produce ionizing radiation. There are three ways to reduce radiation
   exposure: time, distance, and shielding.
 6                                                       VANCEAFBI48-104 2 December 2011


        5.1.1. Time: The amount of time to which personnel are exposed to ionizing radiation
        should be minimized whenever possible. This will minimize the person’s cumulative
        exposure.
        5.1.2. Distance: Radiation levels decrease with distance. The farther the person is from
        the source, the smaller the radiation exposure.
        5.1.3. Shielding: Shielding is used to reduce the amount of ionizing radiation. It is
        effective for x-ray and gamma radiation sources. When shielding is present to minimize
        exposure, it shall be used.
     5.2. Radioactive materials shall not be applied to people or clothing except as part of a
     diagnostic process.
6. Use of RAM or Devices which Produce Radiation by non-Air Force Organizations: Any
use of RAM or devices which produce x-ray radiation by non-Air Force organizations on Vance
AFB shall be approved by the base RSO. Non-Air Force organizations, including contractors,
who plan on using RAM or devices which produce x-ray radiation on base shall notify the base
RSO in writing. Notification for RAM use by contractors shall be IAW AFI 40-201, para 3.4.5.,
at least 30 calendar days before bringing the materials on base. Attachment 2 is an information
sheet that is to be given to contractors to assist in this notification.
7. Storing RAM:
     7.1. Radiation storage areas are classified as ―restricted‖ or ―unrestricted‖ according to T.O.
     00-110N-3. The classification is dependent on the radiation exposure levels measured in the
     storage area. The base RSO determines the storage area classification. If RAM is stored in
     an ―unrestricted‖ area, provisions shall be established to prevent unauthorized removal of
     RAM.
     7.2. All commodities that contain RAM shall be labeled unless excepted by technical order
     or regulation.
8. Shipping RAM:
     8.1. Instructions for shipment of a particular RAM may be specified in a technical order or
     other directive. If this is the case, those instructions shall be followed in addition to the
     requirements in this instruction.
     8.2. Before shipping RAM, the organization shipping the RAM shall contact BEE for
     packaging, labeling, and other shipping requirements.
     8.3. The TMO will notify the BEE of all RAM shipments originating from Vance AFB. It is
     the TMO personnel’s responsibility to ensure RAM is shipped according to DOT regulations.
     As a check, TMO personnel contact the BEE prior to shipment to do a quality control check
     of the shipment. Normally, no specific actions need to be taken when RAM is trans-shipped
     through Vance AFB. However, the BEE shall be contacted whenever RAM that is trans-
     shipped is damaged, is suspected of having surface contamination, or is not labeled correctly.
9. Transporting RAM on Public Roads: In some situations, it may be necessary for base
personnel to transport RAM on public roads off base in government or privately owned vehicles.
When this occurs, the DOT requirements (including labeling) apply. Organizations that may
transport radioactive materials on public roads must contact the BEE for additional information
VANCEAFBI48-104 2 December 2011                                                                7


on labeling and transportation requirements. Organizations shall obtain approval from the BEE
before transporting RAM off base.
10. Receiving RAM: All RAM shipped with a DOT radioactive symbol (white I, yellow II, or
yellow III) shall be checked for contamination with a survey meter within three hours after it is
received. Contact the BEE if the organization does not have the capability to do this monitoring.
Monitoring shall be documented. The documentation shall include the instrument used,
calibration date, date and time monitored, and person performing the monitoring.
11. RAM Disposition:
   11.1. All disposition of excess RAM shall be coordinated with the base RSO. Specific
   disposition procedures depend on the isotope, activity, and physical state of the RAM.
   11.2. Some lensatic compasses and other RAM can be recycled through Wright-Patterson
   AFB. All recycling shall be coordinated with the base RSO.
12. Monitoring: Radiation monitoring will be conducted by the BEE on affected military and
DOD civilians as determined by BEE. In some workplaces (such as NDI), personnel may also
conduct radiation monitoring whenever they use devices which produce x-ray radiation.
Monitoring methods include the use of Thermoluminescent Dosimeters (TLDs), radiation survey
meters, pocket dosimeters, and alarms.
   12.1. TLDs: The BEE identifies Military and DOD civilians who must wear TLDs.
       12.1.1. 71 MDSS Medical Radiology is the only shop on the routine TLD monitoring
       program.

          Committed Equivalent, and Head
          Dose Equivalent
       12.1.2. The supervisor is responsible for identifying to the BEE all personnel who are
       required to wear a TLD. Before issuing a TLD, the BEE must enroll the individual in the
       program and conduct training. This process takes about 20 minutes, and is by
       appointment only. An appointment may be scheduled by calling Ext 7241.
       12.1.3. All personnel who wear TLDs shall do so according to instructions. TLDs shall
       be stored with the control badge when not in use.
       12.1.4. Pregnancy: If a woman who handles RAM or operates X-ray devices becomes
       pregnant, she shall notify the Public Health Element, Ext 7603, and her supervisor of the
       pregnancy. As part of the pregnancy profile, BEE will assess her radiation exposure risks
       and if required, she’ll be enrolled in the monthly TLD monitoring program.

        12.1.5. Off-duty employment: The BEE must be notified of any off-duty employment
        involving RAM.
     12.2. Results of monitoring, including Dosimetry and survey results, are available for review
     in the BEE office in Bldg 810.
13. Training: Personnel who use permitted RAM or x-ray producing devices require initial and
annual radiation safety training. Initial training on radiation safety is normally conducted as a
part of a person’s formal technical training, and will be supplemented as necessary by the
person’s initial workplace safety training provided by the supervisor. The BEE or shop
supervisor will provide annual training.
     13.1. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring training is conducted. The supervisor shall
     maintain training documentation.
     13.2. The supervisor shall schedule all personnel for training and ensure they attend.
     13.3. The supervisor conducting the annual training must meet all of the conditions below:
        13.3.1. The person conducting the training has the necessary experience and
        understanding of radiation safety principles to conduct the training. The base RSO shall
        determine if the person meets this requirement.
        13.3.2. A detailed lesson plan is developed for the training. (The base RSO can assist in
        the development of this lesson plan).
        13.3.3. The lesson plan is approved by the base RSO.
        13.3.4. If a RAM permit exists for the workplace, the lesson plan must cover the permit
        requirements and the location and content of the permit RSO’s binder required by para
        5.5 of this instruction.
        13.3.5. A list of personnel trained is forwarded to BEE (71 MDOS/SGOQB) upon
        completion of training. The list shall include the name of the individuals who performed
        the training.
14. RAM Incidents and Accidents:
     14.1. Any incidents or accidents shall be reported to the base RSO and supervisor
     immediately.
     14.2. Loss or theft of RAM shall be reported to the base RSO, supervisor, and Security
     Forces Squadron immediately.
     14.3. Some situations may require State of Oklahoma notification according to AFI 40-201,
     para 3.12. If this notification is required, the Wing Public Affairs Officer shall issue a
     statement to the Oklahoma Office of Radiation Control. The base RSO will notify the Public
     Affairs Office and prepare a statement. The statement should be issued jointly by the Public
     Affairs Officer and the base RSO.
15. Contractor Operations (Ref attachment 2):
     15.1. Ensure no civilian contractors, Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Energy
     (DoE), or DoE prime contractors are using radioactive material on VAFB without the
     approval or knowledge of 71 MDOS/SGOQB. Non-Air Force users of radioactive materials
VANCEAFBI48-104 2 December 2011                                                             9


  on VAFB must be a VAFB Radioactive Material Permitee and inspected by the VAFB RSO,
  contract monitor, Air Force inspectors, or Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors.
  15.2. Ensure civilian contractors observe the following provisions:
     15.2.1. The contractor must notify 71 MDOS/SGOQB (RSO) before bringing the
     radioactive material onto the installation and must notify them when radioactive material
     is removed. The contractor must ensure that 71 MDOS/SGOQB, installation fire
     department, and safety office know the locations where the material will be used and
     stored when not in use.
     15.2.2. The contractor must comply with the requirements of their NRC or Agreement
     State License and the VAFB Radioactive Material Permit.
     15.2.3. 71 MDOS/SGOQB will randomly check the use of the radioactive material to
     ensure proper radiological health precautions are being followed. If they discover
     improper radiological procedures, SGOQB will immediately notify the contractor
     monitor to initiate corrective actions.

Terms
See AFI 40—201, for additional terms
Base RSO—-The base RSO is normally the senior ranking person in the 71 MDOS
Bioenvironmental Engineering Element. This person runs the base’s radiation safety program.
The base RSO can be contacted at Ext 7241.
Permit RSO—-A permit RSO is required for each RAM permit issued by the USAF RIC. The
RSO is usually the person in the using organization that has control over the RAM. The USAF
RIC establishes qualifications for permit RSOs. If no one within the using organization meets
the qualifications, a qualified person from the Bioenvironmental Engineering Element will be
appointed as the RSO.
Radiation Safety Officer—-There are two types of radiation safety officers, the base RSO and
the permit RSO.

                          ON BASE

The following information must be provided to 71 MDOS/SGOQB for approval (Phone: 213-
7241 and Fax: 213-7650) 30 days prior to a contractor bringing radioactive material onto Vance
AFB and Kegelman AAF. This is an Air Force requirement established by Air Force Instruction
40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the USAF. NOTE: This is required, regardless of
whether or not the NRC or State requires a license.
     A brief description of the proposed activities
     The dates the radioactive material will be used on base
     The name of the contractor and contracted project under which the work is being done
A copy of the NRC or Agreement State license authorizing the use of the radioactive materials
(if one is required)
A copy of the local representative’s current radiation safety training certificate.
The name, local address, and telephone number of the responsible local representative and the
name, address, and telephone number of the radiation safety officer (if there is an NRC license,
this must be the person specified on the license)
An acknowledgement the base radiation safety officer can make periodic checks to ensure
contractor personnel follow radiation safety practices to prevent exposure to Air Force personnel
and avoid contamination of government property
