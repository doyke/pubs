OPR: SMC/EAS/JAQ                                          Certified by: SMC/EA (Col James R. Horejsi)
                                                                                          Pages: 16




1. Introduction. Reference (a) requires Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) developed, pro-
cured, maintained, or used by the federal government be accessible to people with disabilities.
   a. Electronic and Information Technology (EIT). EIT is defined as any system used in the automatic
      acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, inter-
      change, transmission, or reception of data or information. This includes software applications and
      operating systems, web-based intranet and Internet information and systems, telecommunication
      products, video and multimedia products, self-contained or closed products, desktop and portable
      computers, and services (including support services).
   b. Effective Date. Reference (b) required Federal agencies comply with the accessibility standards
      listed in reference (c) beginning 25 Jul 01.
   c. Reasonable Accommodations. Nothing in this policy should be read to diminish AFSPC’s respon-
      sibility for providing reasonable accommodations to qualified employees and applicants for
      employment who have disabilities under reference (d).

2. AFSPC Policy. AFSPC will develop, procure, maintain, and use EIT in accordance with Section 508.

3. Exceptions. EIT that meets one of the following exceptions is not required to comply with Section 508
accessibility standards per references (a), (b), and (c):
   a. EIT for a National Security System (NSS), defined as the function, operation, or use of which
      involves:
       1. Intelligence activities.
       2. Cryptographic activities related to national security.
       3. Command & control of military forces.
2                                                                      SMCI63-105 26 JANUARY 2007


       4. Equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapon systems.
       5. A system that will not be used for routine administrative and business applications (including
          payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications) and that is (a) critical to
          the direct fulfillment of military of intelligence missions or (b) protected at all times by proce-
          dures established for information that have been specifically authorized under criteria estab-
          lished by an Executive order or an Act of Congress to be kept classified in the interest of
          national defense or foreign policy.
    b. EIT acquired by a contractor incidental to a contract, or which is neither used nor accessed by fed-
       eral employees or members of the public.
    c. EIT whose acquisition would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the product or its
       components in order to comply with the Section 508 accessibility standards.
    d. EIT that is located in spaces frequented only by service personnel for maintenance, repair or occa-
       sional monitoring.
    e. It would impose an "undue burden" on the requiring organization to procure EIT that complies
       with Section 5084 accessibility standards.
       1. "Undue burden" is defined as a significant difficulty or expense.
       2. The organization shall consider available resources.
       3. Program managers shall document in writing the basis for an undue burden decision, provide
          that documentation to the Procuring Contract Officer (PCO), and propose an alternative
          means of access.

4. Legacy Systems and Contracts. Section 508 does not apply to "legacy" systems and contracts (i.e.,
those in existence prior to 25 Jun 01) however, the following shall be Section 508 compliant if they con-
tain EIT and no exception applies:
    a. Out of scope modifications to legacy contracts.
    b. New contracts to modify or maintain legacy systems, unless they are for services only. Services
       such as help desk, training, and product support documentation shall be Section 508 compliant. In
       other words:
       1. New maintenance and support contracts on legacy systems do not require the legacy systems
          to be Section 508 compliant.
       2. New contracts for EIT related services, such as helpdesk, training, or product support, must be
          compliant with Subpart D of reference (c), titled Information, Documentation, and Support.
       3. EIT developed, procured, maintained, or used by a contractor to provide services (such as help
          desk support) to the government, does not have to be Section 508 compliant, per paragraph
          3.b.

5. Web Sites. New or modified AFSPC and SMC web sites shall be Section 508 compliant. A National
Security Systems (NSS) exception shall not be applied to any publicly accessible AFSPC or SMC web
site. Additionally, non-public web sites supporting excepted systems should comply whenever possible.
SMCI63-105 26 JANUARY 2007                                                                               3


6. Responsibilities
   a. All AFSPC/SMC Procurement Officials. All personnel involved in the acquisition of EIT shall
      become familiar with Section 508. Specifically, Requiring Officials (i.e., program managers,
      department heads), Contracting Officials, and government EIT developers have a requirement to
      understand their responsibilities, Section 508 accessibility standards, and applicable FAR. Spe-
      cific responsibilities are outlined below. The 508 accessibility standards, FAR changes, as well as
      training, are available on the web at http://www.section508.gov.
   b. AFSPC/SMC Requiring Officials. For all procurements, except those for which Section 508 does
      not apply (see paragraph 3.), Requiring Officials shall "certify" all procurements for Section 508
      compliance by following the steps below. This task is generically referred to as EIT certification,
      and implies completing the EIT certification form referenced below.
       1. EIT Certification Steps
           (a) Determine if a requirement includes EIT.
           (b) If the requirement includes EIT, then determine which Section 508 accessibility standards
               apply and whether an exception applies.
           (c) When considering commercial items, perform market research to determine if any of the
               applicable Section 508 accessibility standards are commercially unavailable.
           (d) For EIT procurements that do not meet any exception, incorporate the applicable Section
               508 accessibility standards into the specification and/or statement of work (SOW).
           (e) Provide exception, commercial unavailability, or specifications/ SOW with incorporated
               Section 508 accessibility standards along with the Purchase Request (PR) to the Contract-
               ing Official.
       2. Enclosures (1) through (4) are available on the AFSPC Section 508 web site to assist Requir-
          ing Officials in performing the tasks outlined above.
       3. Except for those procurements to which Section 508 does not apply (see paragraph 3.),
          Requiring Officials procuring EIT using non-AFSPC/SMC contracts (e.g., GSA contracts,
          Federal Supply Schedules, Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC), multi-agency
          contracts (MAC) issued by other federal agencies) shall provide an EIT certification to the
          cognizant Ordering Officials. When procuring EIT that meets Section 508 accessibility stan-
          dards, Requiring Officials shall not use any contract where the standards would exceed the
          contract scope.
       4. All AFSPC and SMC funding documents and task statements to other government activities
          shall include the following statement:
              "Any Electronic and Information Technology developed, procured, maintained, or used by
              a government activity as a result of this tasking shall be done so in accordance with Section
              508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the FY 2001 Military Con-
              struction Appropriation Act (Public Law 106-246 - 13 July 2000)."
       5. When practical, Requiring Officials shall include approved EIT certification in tasking to
          other government activities. Requiring Officials shall reference any applicable NSS designa-
          tion or Undue Burden Exception Determination when tasking another government agency.
4                                                                      SMCI63-105 26 JANUARY 2007


       6. When acquiring commercial items, Requiring Officials must comply with those Section 508
          accessibility standards that can be met with supplies or services that are available in the com-
          mercial marketplace in time to meet delivery requirements.
       7. Requiring Officials shall ensure that compliance with Section 508 is verified during source
          selection and contract performance (i.e., prior to acceptance). If necessary, compliance testing
          should be performed by the contractor and results provided for review by the accepting offi-
          cial. If products are commercially available which meet some but not all of the Section 508
          accessibility standards, AFSPC & SMC shall procure the product that best meets the stan-
          dards.
       8. The Section 508 Homepage for the Federal IT Accessibility Initiative (FITAI) contains infor-
          mation that can assist Requiring Officials in determining whether a commercial item is com-
          pliant with Section 508 at http://www.section508.gov. The Information Technology Industry
          Council (ITI) has developed a voluntary Internet-based template to help government and ven-
          dors identify products with features that support accessibility at http://www.itic.org/
          archives/articles/20040506/voluntary_product_accessibility_templatetm_vpattm.php
       9. Requiring Officials shall forward NSS determination requests and Undue Burden exception
          determinations to either AFSCP/XX or SMC/ACE Acquisition Support Office for processing.
    c. AFSPC and SMC Contracting Officials. Contracting Officials shall:
       1. Implement Air Force procurement policies and directives consistent with the Federal Acquisi-
          tion Regulations (FAR).
       2. Assist requiring activities with market research for Section 508 EIT that meets applicable Sec-
          tion 508 standards.
       3. Pursue effective acquisition strategies for acquiring EIT that meets applicable Section 508
          standards.
       4. Promote Section 508 compliance at Government Purchase Card Training.
       5. Review Section 508 compliance based on standards at http://www.section508.gov as part of
          Government Purchase Card surveillance.
       6. Ensure that EIT certifications received from Requiring Officials are included in the contract
          file and Sections 508 standards are included into an Request for Proposal (RFP), contract or
          order for EIT (unless the EIT is designated as exempt from those standards).
    d. AFSPC and SMC Government EIT Developers. Government (as opposed to commercial) devel-
       opers shall incorporate Section 508 accessibility standards into EIT they develop for federal use,
       unless an exception applies.
    e. AFSPC and SMC Web Site Owners. AFSPC and SMC Officials responsible for the production of
       web sites shall:
       1. Determine 508 compliance for existing web sites.
       2. Bring principal sites into compliance as soon as possible.
       3. Bring all other sites into compliance as soon as practicable.
SMCI63-105 26 JANUARY 2007                                                                             5


      4. Ensure local web site administration procedures are updated to include Section 508 compli-
         ance testing.
      5. Provide reasonable, alternate accommodation for web page information that may not be Sec-
         tion 508 compliant.
      6. Include the following statement on all principal sites and any site that is not Section 508 com-
         pliant:
              "We are continually working to ensure that this website is accessible to everyone. If you
              find a problem that prevents access, please contact us by sending an e-mail to
              XXX@peterson.af.mil or XXX@losangeles.af.mil. Information that cannot be accessed
              will be provided in an alternative format." **** Need appropriate email addresses above.
              ****
      7. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), through the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative
         (WAI), has published guidance for incorporating Section 508 accessibility standards into web
         sites at http://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html
      8. Include the following statement and a handicapped symbol on all principal sites and any site
         that is Section 508 compliant: “This Air Force website and page is compliant with Section 508
         standards as of (insert date).”

7. Approval Authority
   a. NSS Designations. NSS designations shall be approved by SAF/XC.
   b. Undue Burden Exception. Undue burden exception determinations shall be approved by SAF/XC.
   c. EIT Certification. For AFSPC/SMC, EIT certifications shall be approved at the Program Manager
      level or above. EIT certifications with an NSS or undue burden exception shall reference the
      approved NSS designation or include the approved undue burden exception determination
      accordingly. ACAT III/IV activities shall designate appropriate approval authority for EIT certifi-
      cations; however, this shall not affect NSS designation and undue burden exception determination
      approval authority listed above.

              EIT COMMERCIAL NON-AVAILABILITY CERTIFICATION FORM

To be completed by the Requiring Official and provided to the Contracting Official with the EIT Certifi-
cation Form.

Even if not fully compliant, AFSPC shall acquire the commercial product that provides the greatest
degree of compliance with the Section 508 Technical Standards while satisfying other functional require-
ments. (36 CFR subpart 1194.2 (b)).

Enclosure:
       (1) FAR Commercial Item Definition
       (2) Section 508 Definitions and Technical Standards

1. Describe the commercial item, see enclosure (1), and site the applicable technical standards, see enclo-
sure (2).

2. Describe the market research used to ascertain the non-availability of compliant commercial items.
       Possible references: Request-for-information (RFI) in Federal Business Opportunities, consulta-
       tion with industry, trade associations, Internet, other federal agencies, or accessible product orga-
       nizations such as the IRS Information Resources Accessibility Program (IRAP) and General
       Services Administration (GSA) Center for Information Technology (IT) Accommodation; GSA's
       Federal Supply Service; IRS Disabled Employees Support Acquisitions Contract (DESAC II).

3. Summarize findings on the non-availability of compliant commercial items
including the applicable technical standards that are not met by available
commercial items.

I have determined that a commercial product that meets all of the applicable Section 508 Technical Stan-
dards as well as the requirements of this procurement is not available in the commercial marketplace, nor
expected to become available in time to satisfy delivery requirements.

                 EIT UNDUE BURDEN EXCEPTION DETERMINATION FORM


To be completed by the Requiring Official and provided to the Contracting Official with the EIT Certifi-
cation Form.
Provide information below to justify your determination that compliance with Section 508 Accessibility
Standards (36 CFR Part 1194) for the required EIT imposes an undue burden on your activity. A thorough
explanation is necessary because it may be used to protect your activity against protests and litigation.
Relevant attachments are encouraged.
1. Products or services required to meet the agency's needs:




2. Dollar value of the acquisition, including any options:




3. Applicable Section 508 standards (see 36 CFR part 1194) that are unmet:




4. Market research performed to locate commercial items that meet the applicable standards:




5. The undue burden (i.e. the significant difficulty or expense the Government would incur in order to
comply with a particular standard). If the monetary expense is deemed prohibitive, explain the costs and
how they were estimated.
a. Significant difficulty of compliance:




b. Significant expense of compliance:




c. Insufficient agency resources available to the agency's program or component for which the goods or
service is being acquired:
14                                                                     SMCI63-105 26 JANUARY 2007


6. Alternative means of access that will be provided that will allow the individuals with disabilities to use
the information or data. (29 U.S.C. 794d(a)(1 )(B)). Include effort, labor, costs and time required in the
whole process to implement the alternative means. (This information must be sufficiently detailed since it
may be used in the procurement process technical evaluation.)


I have determined that compliance with Section 508 Accessibility Standards for the required EIT
imposes an Undue Burden per Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as Amended, 36 CFR
Part 1194, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 39.2.

  INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILLING OUT PARAGRAPH 3 OF NSS DETERMINATION FORM
Paragraph 3 should provide a detailed description in layman's terms of what the system does; use of tech-
nical terminology (e.g., describing that the system operates in a specific MHz bandwidth) is discouraged.
Particular attention should be paid to identifying specific types of information transmitted and/or received
by the system.
For example, if paragraph 4(a) is checked, the description in paragraph 3 should provide specific exam-
ples of the types of evaluation information concerning an enemy or possible enemy (e.g., forces, weapons,
capabilities, intentions) or a possible theater of operations and the conclusions drawn there from (e.g.,
bomb damage assessments) -- for that is the generally-understood definition of the term “intelligence” –
that the proposed system receives/transmits.
If paragraph 4(b) is checked, the description in paragraph 3 should provide specific examples of how the
proposed system transmits/receives hidden, disguised or encrypted communications -- for that is the
Defense Department’s definition of the term “cryptologic,”, Joint Publication 1-02; AFDIR 33-303. It is
not required that the system itself encrypts and/or decrypts data -- but if it does so, that fact should be
stated.
If paragraph 4(c) is checked, the description in paragraph 3 should provide specific examples of the types
of information transmitted/received that directly assists the movement of men or material (e.g., air tasking
orders) — for that is the generally-understood definition of "command and control."
If paragraph 4(d) is checked, the description in paragraph 3 should (1) identify the specific weapons sys-
tem(s) that the proposed system is "integral" to, and (2) what would happen to that/those specific weapons
system(s) if the proposed system would fail. Note that the dictionary definition of the word “integral”
means “essential.”
Since the word ‘critical’ in paragraph 4(e) is synonymous with the terms ‘crucial’ or ‘indispensable,’ if
that box is checked for the reasons described in 4(e)(i), the description in paragraph 3 should (1) state
whether any backup systems exist to the proposed system, and (2) the specific military or intelligence
mission the proposed system will directly fulfill. If the program office believes that a specific military or
intelligence mission has been mandated by Congress, the requester should identify specific sections in the
pertinent authorization/appropriations acts and/or specific language in House, Senate, or Conference
Committee reports to support that belief. If that box is checked for the reasons described in 4(e)(ii), the
description in paragraph 3 should explain why that is the case (e.g., cite to the system’s/program’s Secu-
rity Classification Guide).
Note that the word “involves” is included in paragraphs 4(a)-(d) and the word “direct” is used in para-
graph 4(e). Conceivably, virtually everything DoD does bears some relationship, however remote to, e.g.,
the command and control of military forces, intelligence activities, etc. In this context, however, what the
word “involves” or “direct” means is that there must be a very close relationship between the proposed
system and, e.g., the command/control of military forces.
