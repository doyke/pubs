3. Escort Roles and Responsibilities.
   3.1. As a military escort, you are an official representative of the US Air Force under
   circumstances that demand consistently respectful behavior, neat appearance, and an
   understanding of grief responses on the part of the next of kin. You immediately assume a
   role in one of the most psychologically sensitive human conditions known. Your awareness
   of and ability to successfully cope with these emotional interactions will be of long-term
   benefit to the families served.
   3.2. Your conduct should always reflect credit upon the Air Force which you represent. The
   functions of administering funeral service and religious counseling are the professional
   responsibilities of the funeral director and clergy, respectively. Further, it is not your
   responsibility to offer or volunteer information relating to the circumstances of the death, the
   recovery and/or identification of the remains, antemortem or postmortem diagnostic findings,
   or the professional preparations of the remains for viewing and/or burial.
 4                                                              AFPAM 34-504 11 APRIL 2011


        3.2.1. Do not inconvenience the family. Arrange for all personal needs (such as meals,
        lodging, and transportation). Do not solicit and avoid accepting invitations or favors
        from the family and friends of the deceased or merchants in the area.
        3.2.2. Refrain from discussing the nature of your assignment with anyone while en route
        to or from your destination or during your stay at the destination other than necessary
        communication with airline representatives, the family, and the family’s funeral director
        relating to your assigned escort duties.
        3.2.3. Less than acceptable conduct, the use of inaccurate information, and the lack of
        compassionate understanding may cause both harm and embarrassment to the family of
        the deceased and to the Air Force. It is extremely important that you be alert to your
        responsibilities at all times.
     3.3. The prescribed uniform will be worn according to AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal
     Appearance of Air Force Personnel, at all times during the escort assignment. The
     prescribed uniform for escort duty is the service dress uniform with flight cap. NOTE:
     Mourning bands are not worn by escorts.
4. Prescribed Duties.
     4.1. Transportation of Remains Over Land.
        4.1.1. Before departure to destination, secure travel orders and all appropriate
        documentation, as needed to accomplish your duties. Receive a thorough briefing from
        the mortuary officer regarding your escort responsibilities, including a review of the
        essential information listed in paragraph 2.
        4.1.2. Accompany the remains from the contract funeral home or port mortuary facility,
        in the hearse with the funeral director. It is permissible to follow behind the hearse in a
        government owned vehicle or rental car, to the receiving funeral home.
     4.2. Transportation of Remains by Commercial Air or MilAir/Contract MilAir (for Deaths
     occurring in a Combat Theater of Operation).
        4.2.1. Before departure to destination, secure travel orders, common carrier tickets, and
        all appropriate documentation, as needed to accomplish your duties. Receive a thorough
        briefing from the mortuary officer regarding your escort responsibilities, including a
        review of the essential information listed in paragraph 2.
        4.2.2. Accompany the remains from the funeral home or port mortuary facility, usually
        with the funeral director, to the common carrier. Stay with the remains until properly
        assigned to the carrier. Make sure the remains are safeguarded, out of public view, and
        under cover.
            4.2.2.1. Should an unexpected scheduling change occur, telephone the primary
            mortuary officer, alternate mortuary officer, or mortuary technician, who will, in turn,
            notify the receiving funeral director of such changes.
            4.2.2.2. If security measures at the common carrier terminal or scheduling changes
            prevent you from staying with the remains, the local agent will take responsibility for
            the remains. In this event, request access to visually verify the correct remains is
            loaded on the aircraft prior to boarding.
AFPAM 34-504 11 APRIL 2011                                                                       5


       4.2.3. Upon arrival at destination airport you will be met by a 7-person Honor Guard
       Detail, funeral director, or his or her representative. Six personnel from the Honor Guard
       detail will transfer the casket from the aircraft to the next mode of transportation. During
       this movement, the escort and the 7 th Honor Guard Member will render a salute.
          4.2.3.1. Following transfer of the remains from the common carrier or terminal area
          to the funeral director’s hearse, drape the flag over the outer shipping container or the
          casket from which the outer shipping cover has been removed. Drape the flag
          lengthwise over the shipping container or casket with the union at the head and over
          the left shoulder of the deceased (see Figure 4.1).
Methods of Displaying the Flag With the Casket.

Procedures for displaying the flag on the casket are as follows:

Figure 4.1. Closed Casket.
1. Center the flag on the casket with the blue field at the head and over the left shoulder of
the deceased as shown below.




Figure 4.2. Open Half Couch Casket.
1. Fold the flag in a simple “S” fold and place it on the lower panel of the casket as shown
below.
 6                                                         AFPAM 34-504 11 APRIL 2011




Figure 4.3. Simple “S” Fold Instructions.
1. Position casket throw on lower panel of casket.
2. Fold flag toward foot of casket to a point just past the slit that separates the head and
foot panels.
3. Fold flag toward head of casket to a point even with the first fold at the slit between
panels.
4. Fold hoist edge under; fold should only equal width of hoist edge. Hoist edge should not
show.
5. Align stripes of all folds and make sure flag is centered on casket.




Figure 4.4. “Cocked Hat” Flag Display.
1. When floral arrangement or other object is placed on the lower panel of casket, display
the flag in the cocked hat design and place it in the head panel as shown below.
AFPAM 34-504 11 APRIL 2011                                                                      7




   4.3. Deliver all appropriate papers to the funeral director or government cemetery
   representative.
   4.4. Determine through the mortuary officer whether or not the family wishes you to be
   present for the funeral service. At the request of the family, a stopover period of 72 hours is
   authorized. You may be requested by the funeral director or government cemetery
   representative to participate in some part of the graveside service. If so, find out exactly
   what is expected.
   4.5. If circumstances of an emergency or unusual nature (i.e., delay or cancellation in any
   flight, damaged casket or soiled casket interior) arise, you should immediately notify the
   primary mortuary officer, alternate mortuary officer, or mortuary technician, as listed in 2.1-
   2.3.
   4.6. Viewing the remains is the prerogative of the survivors. Opening the casket and making
   such viewing possible is the funeral director’s responsibility. Should the funeral director
   identify any concerns, ensure the funeral director makes immediate contact with the mortuary
   officer, alternate mortuary officer, or mortuary technician for corrective measures. Every
   attempt shall be made to mitigate unexpected circumstances without family involvement.
   4.7. On return to home or duty station, complete AF Form 1947 and deliver or mail it to the
   primary mortuary officer. Include any observations or difficulties encountered and the Air
   Force function in connection with transportation, funeral, military honors, or any other matter
   directly or indirectly related to Air Force Mortuary Affairs responsibilities.
5. The Family of the Deceased Member.
   5.1. Possible Grief Responses of Family Members. The attitude of the family toward the
   loss of a loved one varies. Full and complete recognition and acceptance of the death is
   seldom immediate, and during the period following death, the military escort may witness
   several different emotional responses.
      5.1.1. As the escort, you need to realize that grief responses expressed by the bereaved,
      such as withdrawal, rejection, anger, or hostility, are normal reactions to death and are
      not being directed toward specific individuals.
 8                                                              AFPAM 34-504 11 APRIL 2011


        5.1.2. As a representative of the US Air Force, you may symbolize associated
        circumstances relating to the loss and therefore, you may become a temporary object of
        one or more grief emotions. You are expected and required to act in the best interest of
        the family and of the Air Force at all times. In your special role, this may be best
        affected by being a patient and understanding listener, rather than a poorly qualified
        counselor.
        5.1.3. Do not impose on the privacy of the family’s grief, but maintain a state of
        convenient availability should your presence be required or requested.
     5.2. Communicating with Family Members.
        5.2.1. Do not attempt to answer specific questions on subjects such as insurance,
        gratuities, arrears in pay, awards, or decorations. If asked, advise the next of kin that he
        or she will be contacted soon by a Casualty Assistance Officer from the Air Force
        installation nearest his or her home who should be able to give definite and complete
        information.
        5.2.2. If questions are raised concerning the status of disposition of personal effects and
        property, advise the family you will pass the questions on to the primary mortuary officer
        who will, in turn, contact them on these matters.
6. Use of the Interment Flag.
     6.1. Flag Recipients. (The entitlement to receive an interment flag is specified by public
     law) The authorized flag recipients are as follows:
        6.1.1. Spouse.
        6.1.2. Children.
        6.1.3. The parents of the fallen Airman. If married, the parents will receive one flag
        together. If divorced, each parent will receive a flag.
        6.1.4. PADD if not already covered in 6.1.1, 6.1.2 or 6.1.3.
NOTE: The mortuary officer where the death occurred will provide the flag to drape the casket.
The installation providing Military Funeral Honors will furnish the additional required number of
flags.
     6.2. Display of Flag. Position the flag so the union (blue/star field) is at the head and over
     left shoulder of the deceased (see Figure 4.1).
        6.2.1. Transportation Over Land. The flag will be draped over the casket and displayed
        throughout the movement from the contract funeral home or port mortuary facility to the
        receiving funeral home or national cemetery.
        6.2.2. Transportation by Commercial Air or MilAir/Contract MilAir (for deaths
        occurring in a Combat Theater of Operation). On arrival at the common carrier terminal
        at final destination, drape the flag over the shipping container, or if removed from the air
        tray, the closed casket.
     6.3. The flag may drape a closed casket or half-opened casket. See Figures 4.1 – 4.2 for
     proper display procedures.
AFPAM 34-504 11 APRIL 2011                                                                    9


  6.4. Flag Procedure at the Graveside.
     6.4.1. When the casket has been carried to the grave and positioned on the lowering
     device, the noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC) brings the bugler and firing
     party to Order Arms. The Honor Guard elements of firing party, bugler, and color guard
     are brought to Parade Rest. The pallbearers then lift the interment flag from the casket
     and hold it tautly, waist high, over the grave.
     6.4.2. At the conclusion of Taps, the pallbearers fold the flag in the prescribed manner
     (see Figure 6.1). The pallbearer at the head of the casket, on the side where the family is
     seated, is the last pallbearer to have possession of the newly folded flag. After ensuring
     the flag fold is tight and smooth, the pallbearer hands the flag to the designated person
     who is to present the flag to the next of kin. The flag may be presented by you, the
     chaplain or clergy, the funeral ceremonial team officer in charge (OIC), or the NCOIC.
     6.4.3. The person who presents the flag to the authorized recipient(s) as listed in
     paragraphs 6.1.1 through 6.1.4 should make some statement on behalf of our
     government such as, ―this flag is offered by a grateful nation in memory of the faithful
     service performed by your loved one.‖

Figure 6.1. Folding the United States Flag.




NOTE: In funerals where more than one flag is authorized for presentation, there should be a
chair or small table in the vicinity of the head of the grave to accommodate the additional, pre-
folded flags. The flag draping the casket during the service is the first to be presented, and is
presented to the primary next of kin, unless otherwise requested. The additional flags are
presented to the other authorized recipient(s).
