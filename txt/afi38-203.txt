IC-1 TO AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program

26 FEBRUARY 2013

*SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change implements new guidelines that clarify policy surrounding contractor
notification after the decision to convert previously out-sourced activities to in-house.

(Replace Existing) 6.2. The Performance Work Statement will:

(Replace Existing) 11.1.1. As stated in 10 U.S.C. 2463, the CCSO may use economic analysis
in lieu of A-76 public-private competition to determine the low cost provider with respect to new
requirements, expansions, and conversions from contract to agency performance.

(Add New) 11.1.1.1. When converting a whole or partial contract to in-house performance, the
functional requiring official shall determine and document its final in-sourcing decisions, and
forward the determination to the Contracting Officer. Within 20 business days of the receipt of
such decision, the Contracting Officer shall provide a written notification to affected incumbent
private sector providers. No formal hiring or contract related actions may be initiated prior to
such notification, except for preliminary internal actions associated with hiring or contract
modification. Notifications issued by contracting officers to affected private sector providers
may summarize, in an appropriate and consistent format, the requiring official’s final
determination.

(Add New) 11.1.1.2. The Contracting Officer shall take appropriate contract action to remove
the workload being in-sourced and no longer performed by the contractor. Where necessary or
appropriate, determinations and notification to in-source should be made in a timely manner so
as to align with decisions to avoid exercising option periods or re-competition of expiring
contracts as a result of such in-sourcing action.

(Replace Existing) (Glossary) Quality Assurance (QA) Personnel—Individual(s) designated
to perform quality assessment activities and manage performance IAW the Performance Plan.
They serve as on-site technical managers assessing contractor performance against contract
performance standards. Personnel in this area have many titles, such as Quality Assurance
Evaluator (QAE), Quality Assurance Specialist (QAS), Contracting Officer’s Representative and
Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR); however, their duties are essentially the
same. Primarily allocate civilian authorizations for QA personnel positions. Military will not be
allocated for full-time QA personnel responsibilities since these activities are not military
essential; however, they may perform QA personnel responsibilities as an additional duty.

                                                Chapter 1

         PERFORMANCE OF AIR FORCE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES PROGRAM
                                OVERVIEW

1.1. Policy. This chapter provides an overview of the policy consistent with the Office of Management
and Budget Circular (OMBC) A-76 and other related laws and directives as well as general roles and
responsibilities for the Air Force (AF) Commercial Activities (CA) Program.
    1.1.1. The purpose of the AF CA program is to determine the best utilization of the commander’s
    (CC) resources (monetary, physical and human) to serve mission needs and the military community,
    consistent with labor laws, fiscal laws and procurement regulations.
    1.1.2. The commander responsible for the resources to perform the workload is the person responsi-
    ble for the in-house activity or Agency Tender (AT) (including the Government’s written plan for a
    Most Efficient Organization (MEO)).
    1.1.3. The MEO is not coextensive with the employees and A-76 creates no rights for the employees
    or their representatives other than the rights they already enjoy through other laws and regulations.
    The MEO is a written document describing the Government’s in-house approach in providing the ser-
    vice(s) defined in the Performance-based Work Statement (PWS). Directly affected employees and
    their representatives will be consulted in the development and preparation of the MEO.
    1.1.4. Under Title 5, U.S.C. DoD civilian employees have certain rights (e.g., seniority,
    bump-and-retreat, relocation, reassignment, and to file a complaint about decisions of the Agency
    Tender Official (ATO) and other Government officials). Employees have no personal rights to
    enforce the Right of First Refusal clause in the contract. Employee rights, as applicable, will be taken
    into consideration in developing the Government’s MEO plan.
    1.1.5. The ATO represents the agency’s interests. In the labor-management equation, the ATO is on
    the side of management. The ATO helps prepare the commander’s MEO plan in compliance with
    applicable labor laws. The ATO presents the Government’s AT for standard competition only upon
    approval by command channels as further explained in these procedures.
    1.1.6. Under the bid protest jurisdiction of 31 U.S.C. 3551 et seq. the ATO is charged with the ability
    to seek independent review by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The intent is to ensure
    fairness and integrity of the procurement process. In this context of independent review, a bid protest
    filed by the ATO is in the Government’s interest.
    1.1.7. The ATO and the contracting officer speak for the Government during the protest phase of the
    competition, because the Performance Decision is tentative and there is no final agency position until
    the reviews and protest are concluded. The Performance Decision, the source selection process, con-
    tent of discussions and so forth are subject to review under the usual procedural and substantive rules
    applied during protests (see paragraph 9.7.)
    1.1.8. As an agency official acting in the scope of employment on behalf of the agency, the ATO is
    entitled to agency-provided legal services. Since agency attorneys assigned to the ATO and MEO
    Team are representing the Government, they will not enter into an attorney-client relationship with the
    employees.
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                 9


   1.1.9. Due to legal constraints in 10 U.S.C. 2461 and Defense Appropriation Act provisions, the AT
   cannot be eliminated from the public-private competition. The Contracting Officer and Source Selec-
   tion Authority (SSA) cannot direct, or attempt to influence any change to the AT including the number
   of full time equivalents (FTEs). Instead, the Contracting Officer and Source Selection Authority
   (SSA), through discussions with the ATO, must give the commander the opportunity to either change
   the Performance-based Work Statement (PWS) or revise the resources available to support the AT.
   The Command/CV (or equivalent) has the final authority to make determinations regarding deficien-
   cies in an AT, paragraph1.6.1.10.
   1.1.10. The Component Competitive Sourcing Official (CCSO) determines what activities are inher-
   ently governmental and what commercial activities are not suitable for performance by a private sec-
   tor provider. The CCSO’s determination must take into account the operational plans of the unified
   and specified combatant commands and the DoD manpower mix criteria.
   1.1.11. Public-private competition (based on low cost) is not required when there is a mission-related
   reason to bring work in-house or where a statute (i.e., 10 U.S.C. 2492) allows the commander to deter-
   mine if performance by Appropriated Fund (APF) or Non-appropriated Fund (NAF) employees is
   more beneficial to the Government.
   1.1.12. Any time two or more activities, locations or prior private sector contracts are involved in a
   proposed public-private competition, an analysis of the effects of “bundling” and “consolidation”
   must be completed in accordance with (IAW) FAR, Subpart 7.107(e) (bundling) and Defense Acqui-
   sition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Subpart 270.107 (consolidation).

1.2. Applicability. The AF CA Program applies to:
   1.2.1. All activities assigned to the United States Air Force (USAF) including major commands
   (MAJCOM), field operating agencies (FOA), direct reporting units (DRU), Air Force Reserve Com-
   mand (AFRC) and the Air National Guard (ANG)--hereafter referred to as “commands.”
   1.2.2. Joint activities, in cases where the AF is the executive agent for the joint activity.
   1.2.3. AF CAs performed by NAF activities when they are staffed with government personnel paid by
   or reimbursed from appropriated funds.
   1.2.4. Any conversion without regard to the number of civilian employee authorizations.
       1.2.4.1. From agency performance by military or DoD civilian employee authorizations to private
       sector contractor performance.
       1.2.4.2. From private sector contractor performance to military or DoD civilian employee perfor-
       mance.

1.3. Nonapplicability. The AF CA Program does not apply:
   1.3.1. When contrary to law, executive order, treaty, international agreement, or the Federal Acquisi-
   tion Regulation (FAR), as determined by the servicing Staff Judge Advocate (SJA).
       1.3.1.1. Public Law 105-270 and DoDD 1100.4., Guidance for Manpower Management, prohibit
       contracting out of inherently governmental activities as defined in Chapter 2 and Attachment 2,
       Supplemental Guidelines for Identifying an Inherently Governmental Activity, of this instruction.
       See also the definitions and guidance in Federal Acquisition Regulation 2.1. and 7.5., implement-
10                                                                            AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


        ing Section 1205 of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 National Defense Authorization Act, or successor
        provisions.
        1.3.1.2. Public Law 109-163 precludes contracting out those commercial activities that are inap-
        propriate for private sector performance or which meet any of the other exemptions identified in
        OMBC A-76 Attachment A or the DoD Manpower Mix Criteria identified in Chapter 2. See
        FAR, Subpart 7.5 regarding activities closely associated with inherently governmental activities.
        See also Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 3020.37, Continuation of Essential DoD Con-
        tractor Services During Crises, and DoDI 3020.41, Contractor Personnel Authorized to Accom-
        pany the U.S. Armed Forces, as well as 10 U.S.C. 2461, as amended by Section 341 of the FY
        2006 National Defense Authorization Act, or successor provisions in annual statutes, requiring
        mission impact analysis before converting a commercial activity from agency performance to pri-
        vate sector contractor performance.
     1.3.2. Overseas, when inconsistent with any treaty, international agreement, executive order; labor
     agreement, or a foreign nation’s law, decree, operating procedure/regulation, or custom/accepted prac-
     tice.
     1.3.3. To in-house AF CAs staffed solely with direct-hire or indirect-hire non-US citizen employees
     when host international agreements apply.
     1.3.4. To Category “C” Revenue-Generating Activities; Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR)
     activities staffed solely with non-appropriated fund (NAF) instrumentality (NAFI) employees; activi-
     ties operated under NAFI Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs); or other NAFI activities manned
     solely with NAFI employees (e.g., lodging facilities) with no appropriated fund (APF)
     reimbursement or with reimbursement under the Department of Defense MWR Utilization, Support,
     and Accountability (USA) or Uniform Funding and Management (UFM) Practice.
     1.3.5. In times of a declared war or military mobilization, unless the DoD Competitive Sourcing Offi-
     cial (CSO) determines that OMBC A-76 applies.
     1.3.6. Converting from performance by military members to performance by DoD civilian employees
     (“military-civilian conversions”) where none of the work will be converted to contract.

1.4. Commercial Activities Program. The AF CA Program consists of the following processes that are
explained in detail in subsequent chapters. They are:
     1.4.1. Inventory Process;
     1.4.2. Preliminary Planning Process (P3);
     1.4.3. Public-Private Competition Public Announcement;
     1.4.4. Public-Private Competition (in progress);
     1.4.5. Decisions:
        1.4.5.1. Performance decision is prior to resolution of any contests/protests. The performance
        decision date is the official end date for a public-private competition.
        1.4.5.2. Final decision is the decision that is implemented (e.g., private sector contract award,

1.5. Special Considerations.
   1.5.1. The AF CA Program does not:
       1.5.1.1. Justify conversion to contract solely to avoid personnel ceilings or salary limitations.
       1.5.1.2. Provide authority to enter into contracts or authorize contracts that establish an
       employer-employee relationship (personal services) between the AF and private sector contractor
       employees as described in FAR, Subpart 37.104.
   1.5.2. All participants in the A-76 process must avoid conflicts of interest that may result from inap-
   propriate participation on multiple teams to include private sector contractor. However, members of
   the P3 Team are permitted to be PWS and/or Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) members.
   Directly affected government personnel may not serve on the SSEB. Firewalls are used to prevent the
   appearance (perceived or actual) of a conflict of interest. At a minimum, firewalls must consist of:
       1.5.2.1. Mechanisms to prevent sharing of information by persons on the MEO Team with per-
       sons on the PWS Team.
       1.5.2.2. Mechanisms to prevent sharing of information by persons on the PWS Team with persons
       on the MEO Team.
       1.5.2.3. Nondisclosure agreements.
       1.5.2.4. Enforcement measures. All persons participating on either team must be free from orga-
       nizational and personal conflict(s) of interest including the appearance of bias, undue influence
       and unfair competitive advantage.
   1.5.3. All participants must comply with applicable procurement integrity and ethics statutes and
   implementing regulatory and policy guidance (see FAR, Subpart 3.104). Consult with the local Staff
   Judge Advocate regarding specific situations where conflicts of interest or ethics issues may poten-
   tially occur.
   1.5.4. All correspondence to AF/A1MS should be submitted via electronic means only unless other-
   wise specifically requested.

         ees in a variety of fora, and the agency has a preeminent interest in legal representation in such
         proceedings. The ATO should be aware of the interaction between labor-management under
         Title 5 U.S.C. as well as 10 U.S.C. 2461 the Americans with Disabilities Act, Equal Employ-
         ment Opportunity requirements, etc.
         1.6.23.3.2. The SJA will put in writing the terms of representation for the ATO and MEO
         Team. For example, the attorney aids the ATO and MEO Team only with respect to their offi-
         cial duties; the ATO is the principal official being assisted on behalf of the agency; and the
         employees are not “clients.” The CPF and Contracting Officer should answer employee ques-
         tions about Right of First Refusal, Reduction-in-Force, and other personnel related concerns.
         The attorney will not have direct attorney-client relationship with any directly affected gov-
         ernment personnel regarding their personal interest. Additionally, there will be adequate fire-
         walls among other attorneys to prevent inappropriate transmission of information between the
         SSA/Contracting Officer or PWS Team and the ATO/MEO Team.

                                         INVENTORY PROCESS

2.1. Policy. Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (ODUSD) and AF provide detailed instruc-
tions annually, implementing the inventory review and documentation process. This chapter provides a
summary of policy for determining if an in-house activity is an inherently governmental (IG) activity or a
commercial activity (CA), conducting the AF Inherently Governmental and Commercial Activities
(IGCA) Inventory review and maintaining the IGCA Inventory. The IGCA Inventory is an annual review
encompassing an accounting of all in-house activities in the Active, Active Guard and Reserve, and
Selected Reserve forces to include part-time drilling and transient authorizations. The annual inventory is
mandated by the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act, OMBC A-76, ODUSD policy, and this
instruction.
     2.1.1. Annual Inventory Requirement. The AF IGCA Inventory is a snapshot in time of all funded
     authorizations as of the end of the fiscal year. These authorizations include all appropriated funded
     military (active and reserve components) and DoD civilian manpower (U.S. and foreign national) in
     the unit manning document. The authorizations do not include manpower paid through non-appropri-
     ated funds, services obtained through contracts with the private sector and through inter-service and
     intra-governmental support agreements. OSD provides specific instructions to include the data to be
     submitted by 15 April of the following year. The AF will submit the following to OSD: (a) an inven-
     tory of CA performed by government positions; (b) an inventory of inherently governmental activities
     performed by government positions; and (c) an inventory summary report.
     2.1.2. OMB Review and Consultation. On an annual basis, OMB reviews both inventories and con-
     sults with OSD regarding the inventory content. The AF is responsible for justifying and defending
     inquiries pertaining to the inventory to ODUSD and OMB.
     2.1.3. Congressional and Public Notification. After OMB review and consultation, OSD will make
     both inventories available to Congress and the public unless the inventory information is deleted or
     otherwise protected for national security reasons. OMB publishes a notice of availability in the Fed-
     eral Register where the inventory is posted.
     2.1.4. The FAR, Part 2 definition of “inherently governmental function” and the FAR, Subpart 7.5
     lists of activities that cannot be contracted were incorporated into statutory law and are the controlling
     definitions and prohibitions for DoD. Whenever the FAR and OMB Circular A-76 are inconsistent
     with respect to what activities are suitable for contracting, the FAR is controlling for DoD.
     2.1.5. The mission of the AF is to train and equip forces to satisfy its requirement to supply capabili-
     ties to the combatant commands. Therefore, the AF must match positions to projected deployment of
     government personnel for use by the combatant commands.

2.2. AF Inherently Governmental/Commercial Activity (IGCA) Inventory.
     2.2.1. Inherently governmental: The CCSO will justify, in writing, any designation of government
     personnel performing inherently governmental activities. The justification will be made available to
     OMB and the public upon request. Inherently governmental justifications will be based on the DoD
     Manpower Mix Criteria in DoDI 1100.22 and this instruction to reflect DoD decisions in determining
     requirements with regard to IG and CA positions and activities. (See Attachment 2, Appendix A)

   2.2.2. Commercial Activities Exempt from Private Sector Performance: The CCSO will justify, in
   writing, any designation of government personnel performing commercial activities that are inappro-
   priate for private sector performance. The justification will be made available to OMB and the public
   upon request. Justifications will be based on the Manpower Mix Criteria. (See Attachment 2,
   Appendix B)
   2.2.3. Upon acceptance by OSD of the AF IGCA Inventory, AF/A1MS will ensure the Manpower
   Programming and Execution System (MPES) reflects the results of the last review. Commands will
   ensure Inventory data fields are updated in MPES as changes occur. Additionally, all contract man-
   power equivalents (CME) associated with any existing service contract will be reflected in MPES
   IAW AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower Requirements.
   2.2.4. The AF IGCA Inventory, excluding activities engaged in classified or other national security
   activities, will be made available to the public upon request under the provisions of the Freedom of
   Information Act (FOIA) and the FAIR Act, PL 105-270.
   2.2.5. Inventory challenge process under the FAIR Act Challenge Process.
       2.2.5.1. Inventory challenge authorities will be officials at the same level as, or a higher level
       than, the individual who approved the inventory. Inventory challenge authorities will review and
       respond to challenges of inventory decisions.
       2.2.5.2. Inventory appeal authorities will be officials who are independent and at a higher level
       than inventory challenge authorities and will review and respond to appeals of inventory challenge
       decisions made by inventory challenge authorities.
       2.2.5.3. At the publication site of OMB’s Federal Register, instructions as to the acceptable rea-
       sons for a challenge, the challenge format, and the response format will be provided for the chal-
       lenge and potential appeal.
   2.2.6. Storage of IGCA Reporting Data. IGCA data files and reports are destroyed at:

                                                Chapter 3

                            PRELIMINARY PLANNING PROCESS (P3)

3.1. Policy. This chapter provides guidance for nominating preliminary planning candidates, conducting
P3 to determine if an A-76 public-private competition is the optimal sourcing methodology, and proce-
dures for the Go/No-Go Decision review, refinement, and staffing process. Preliminary planning is man-
datory and must be accomplished expeditiously to ensure currency of P3 deliverables (primarily cost
data).

3.2. Preliminary Planning Request. Commands request preliminary planning for a potential stream-
lined or standard competition (Figure 3.1. and Figure 3.2.). The IGCA Inventory does not drive candi-
date nomination, but inventory coding may be affected by Preliminary Planning.
   3.2.1. Prior to initiating preliminary planning for a new competition, Command Manpower and Orga-
   nization (or equivalent) will forward a P3 request memorandum to AF/A1MS and obtain approval.
   For MEOs beginning follow-on competitions, forward a notification of the intent to begin preliminary
   planning to AF/A1MS, with a courtesy copy to AFMA/MAC. It is not necessary to obtain or wait for
   approval to begin P3 for MEO follow-on competitions.
   3.2.2. AF/A1MS will staff the P3 request and provide a decision memorandum (approval or disap-
   proval) within 45 calendar days .
   3.2.3. The requesting organization will e-mail a project plan including a schedule of preliminary plan-
   ning milestones to AFMA/MAC and the affected Command Manpower and Organization within 30
   calendar days of the date of the approval memorandum. Chapter 10 outlines instructions for fol-
   low-on competitions.

3.3. Preliminary Planning Process. P3 should be accomplished within six months from receipt of AF/
A1MS approval to a Go/No-Go Decision submitted to AFMA/MAC for review. Go decisions result in
completion of a candidate nomination RCS: HAF-A1M (AR) 9401, Memorandum of Intent to Compete a
Commercial Activity (Figure 4.1.), also referred to as the 9401 memorandum. No-Go Decisions require
a Memorandum of Intent Not to Compete a Commercial Activity (Figure 3.6.), also referred to as a
No-Go memorandum. If P3 is anticipated to take more than six months, an extension request with justifi-
cation should be submitted along with the command request to conduct P3. Commands will submit
monthly updates to AFMA/MAC when P3 extends beyond six months. All costs to conduct P3 will be
captured and provided when completing the 9401 memorandum or No-Go memorandum. At a minimum,
the P3 will include the following:
   3.3.1. Project Scoping. Determine the activities, government personnel, support agreements, and
   existing contracts (CME positions, if any) to be competed. This research should consider information
   such as the IGCA Reason Source Code (RSC), UTC, AEF requirements, mobility requirements,
   stressed career field data, career progression, and overseas rotation. RSC codes may be found on the
   MPES website in the reference tables under “Tools.”
       3.3.1.1. Identify and separately address activities that are essential to continue during a crisis but
       cannot be accomplished by a private sector service provider IAW DoDI 3020.37 and 3020.41.
       The P3 Team must understand how the activity being scoped relates to commanders’ contingency
       plans, specifically because the AF must train and equip military members to be able to provide
22                                                                             AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


        capabilities to the Combatant Commanders. If contingency plans call for military or parties other
        than the private sector service provider to perform essential services in an emergency, the P3 Team
        must identify whether the nature of the services require training prior to an emergency. If so, P3
        must include the requirement(s) in service identification and identify the need for funding for a
        private sector service provider to train military members, DoD civilians or other personnel (e.g.,
        host nation forces) to replace the private sector employees during a crisis. In some situations, this
        may lead to a conclusion that these activities are not appropriate for public-private competition
        and result in a decision not to compete the activity.
        3.3.1.2. Identify other mission areas that rely on or are associated with the activity being consid-
        ered for public-private competition. The public-private competition will be required to examine
        the potential impact of contract performance on these related missions. Section 2461 of Title 10,
        U.S.C., requires this examination be performed as part of the public-private competition and shape
        the performance decision. Results of this examination will guide the decision of what commer-
        cial activities are suitable for public-private competition and which are removed from the pub-
        lic-private competition.
        3.3.1.3. The initial project scope may be refined throughout P3 based on ongoing research. Con-
        sideration should also be given to the identification of the Continuing Government Organization
        (CGO) (activities, including inherently governmental activities, extracted from a predominantly
        competeable organization and combined into one or more non-competeable organizations).
     3.3.2. Preliminary Planning Market Research (PPMR).
        3.3.2.1. Perform market research to:
           3.3.2.1.1. Aid in determining whether the activity under consideration is viable for public-pri-
           vate competition.
           3.3.2.1.2. Establish the proper grouping of those activities to facilitate competition with the
           private sector.
           3.3.2.1.3. Assist management in making the decision to pursue a public-private competition or
           not.
           3.3.2.1.4. Identify viable commercial sources that are capable and interested in performing
           commercial activities at a reasonable price.
        3.3.2.2. Contact the DOD CSO when considering the possible conversion of a commercial activ-
        ity to or from agency performance if the activity is:
           3.3.2.2.1. Included on the procurement list established pursuant to section 2 of the Jav-
           its-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 47);
           3.3.2.2.2. Being considered for possible performance by a qualified nonprofit agency for the
           blind or by a qualified nonprofit agency for other severely handicapped individuals in accor-
           dance with that Act; or
           3.3.2.2.3. Being considered for possible performance by a qualified firm under at least 51 per-
           cent ownership by an Indian tribe, as defined in section 4(e) of the Indian Self- Determination
           and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b(e)), or a Native Hawaiian Organization, as
           defined in section 8(a)(15) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(15)).
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                   23


         3.3.2.2.4. Obtain capability briefings, but not firm prices, from AbilityOne (under the Jav-
         its-Wagner-O’Day (JWOD) Act) nonprofit agencies so that streamlined competition can be
         fully considered (see paragraph 7.2.).
     3.3.2.3. Group the activities as business units consistent with industry practices and the require-
     ments found in FAR, Subpart 7.107(e) (bundling) and DFARS, Subpart 207.107 (consolidation)
     when grouping:
         3.3.2.3.1. Includes consolidating two or more requirements for supplies or services previously
         performed under separate smaller contracts into a solicitation for one contract and;
         3.3.2.3.2. Is not likely to be suitable for performance by a small business or;
         3.3.2.3.3. Would adversely affect an incumbent private sector contractor.
  3.3.3. Preliminary Labor Market Research (PLMR). Assess the availability or capability to
  recruit (including cost to recruit) personnel in the labor market to determine if the appropriate work-
  force pool will be available, considering government and private sector resources. Labor market
  assessments should include, but not limited to, evaluating the interaction between management and
  labor in the local market (e.g., organized labor seeking employee representation); identifying if there
  are problems with the existing contractor labor force (e.g., threats of striking and talks of unionizing).
  Contact the AF Labor Advisors for assistance addressing these issues.
  3.3.4. Services Identification. Identify outputs of activities or processes and agency or industry per-
  formance standards. Results should focus on clearly identifying activities required to be performed
  and serve as the foundation for PWS development during the public-private competition. If identi-
  fied, document the possibility for waiver requests to AFIs or policy directives to be submitted IAW
  paragraph 5.2.6.
  3.3.5. Workload Data and Systems. Using the activities identified during services identification,
  assess the availability and accuracy of workload data and work units, quantify outputs and, if neces-
  sary, establish data collection methodologies and systems to actually collect workload data. A useful
  source for this step is AFMAN 38-208, Volume I, Air Force Management Engineering Program
  (MEP) -- Processes, Chapter 3.
  3.3.6. Preliminary Planning Baseline Cost. Preliminary Planning baseline cost is developed using
  standard competition criteria.
     3.3.6.1. Using the COMPARE software and IAW the DoD Costing Manual and any additional
     DoD or AF guidance (available on the AFMA website), determine the Preliminary Planning Base-
     line Cost (PBC) of the incumbent service provider. Since no decision has been made on contract-
     ibility, no decision is made on government furnished property (GFP). Collect all available costs.
     The initial P3 baseline cost will include all facilities, equipment, material, supplies, or other ser-
     vices provided by the government. The baseline cost is the current cost of operations for the
     incumbent service provider and is based on 12 months of historical data; therefore, only the first
     performance period is completed. At the completion of P3 when the Go/No-Go decision is made,
     a decision is also made on the type of competition for a Go decision. It is at this time; the COM-
     PARE software is run to align the PBC with the selected competition type (streamlined or stan-
     dard). COMPARE will automatically adjust to make available only the required lines needed for
     the type of competition selected.
24                                                                            AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


        3.3.6.2. A Baseline Costing Official (BCO) is responsible for certifying the Preliminary Planning
        Baseline Cost Report (BCR) and later the Adjusted BCR. This individual must remain indepen-
        dent of the official preparing the Agency Cost Estimate (ACE) for streamlined and standard com-
        petitions.
     3.3.7. Initiate action to comply with the EIAP, Title 32 CFR, §989.
     3.3.8. Competitive Sourcing Decision Package (CSDP). The CSDP consists of three parts: Part
     1-Project Summary, Part 2-Interim Deliverables, and Part 3-Supporting Documentation. Prepare and
     submit a CSDP, Part 1-Project Summary for project sponsor approval prior to submission to Com-
     mand/CV. The CSDP will include:
        3.3.8.1. Preliminary Planning Project Summary (Part 1) with the competitive sourcing recom-
        mendation.
        3.3.8.2. Interim Deliverables (Part 2) include:
            3.3.8.2.1. Project Scope Report (inventory identification/contract matrix/manpower matrix).
            3.3.8.2.2. Services Identification Report (include a discussion of military missions relying on
            or associated with the activity being scoped, see paragraph 3.3.1.2.).
            3.3.8.2.3. Workload Data and System(s) Report.
            3.3.8.2.4. Preliminary Planning Market Research Report.
            3.3.8.2.5. Preliminary Labor Market Research Report.
            3.3.8.2.6. Baseline Cost Report (BCR) from COMPARE signed by the Baseline Costing Offi-
            cial, COMPARE model (identified as “For Official Use Only” (FOUO)), and a narrative
            report.
        3.3.8.3. Supporting Documentation (Part 3) with all the source documents used to gather the
        information (i.e., interview sheets, collection worksheets, and meeting minutes)

3.4. A-76 “No-Go” Decision. Develop the No-Go Memorandum (Figure 3.6.) including attachments
and forward through the Command Manpower and Organization (or equivalent), to AFMA for review.
Should the results of any step in P3 indicate a “No-Go” decision, the rest of P3 does not need to be
completed. However, rationale supporting the “No-Go” decision will be provided in the No-Go Memo-
randum and the CSDP Parts 1 and 2 will address what remaining areas of P3 were not completed and
why. This memorandum will also recommend when some or all positions reviewed should be reconsid-
ered, generally three to five years. Commands should consider other strategic sourcing initiatives such as
military-to-civilian conversion, NAFI Memorandums of Agreements, etc., as alternatives to A-76 in these
circumstances. After AFMA review, Command Manpower and Organization (or equivalent) will staff the
memorandum and forward to AF/A1M. Upon approval, correct IGCA coding and maintain documenta-
tion supporting the decision IAW AF Records Disposition System (RDS) and 10 U.S.C. 2463.

3.5. A-76 “Go” Decision.
     3.5.1. Determine Competition Type. If the P3 decision is to conduct a competitive sourcing compe-
     tition, numerous factors should be considered when deciding the type of public-private competition–
     streamlined or standard. The type of public-private competition must be determined before conclud-
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                              25


  ing P3 because it must be identified in the Go decision and 9401 memorandum. Table 3.3. may be
  used to help determine public-private competition type.
     3.5.1.1. Factors affecting the type of public-private competition include the number of DoD civil-
     ian employee authorizations performing the activity on the competition start date, the proposed
     number of DoD civilian employee authorizations in the agency cost estimate (ACE), the length of
     time needed to conduct a fair and equitable public-private competition, and whether AbilityOne
     businesses, nonprofit agencies, or small business firms are available to compete.
     3.5.1.2. The number of military, NAF, and direct-/indirect-hire non-US citizen employees does
     not directly impact public-private competition type, except as, they affect the number of DoD
     civilian employee authorizations included in the agency cost estimate (see paragraph 3.5.1.3.)
     3.5.1.3. The Agency Cost Estimate (ACE). The ACE will be based on civilian positions as mili-
     tary positions must be converted to civilian authorization during the first available budget exer-
     cise. In a streamlined competition the civilian costs must remain within the Streamlined
     Competition Form (SLCF) costs used to make the final decision.
     3.5.1.4. Streamlined Competition:
        3.5.1.4.1. Streamlined Required: An activity is required to conduct a streamlined competi-
        tion if the activity or any portion of the activity is being performed by at least one but less
        than 10 DoD civilian employee authorizations on the competition start date and:
            3.5.1.4.1.1. The ACE will be based on less than 10 DoD civilian employee authorizations.

            3.5.1.4.1.2. Any number of military and the ACE will be based on less than 10 DoD civil-
            ian employee authorizations.
        3.5.1.4.2. Streamlined Optional: An activity may conduct a streamlined or standard competi-
        tion only if on the competition start date, the activity is performed by no DoD civilian
        employee authorizations and:
            3.5.1.4.2.1. Any number of military authorizations and the ACE will be based on less than
            10 DoD civilian employee authorizations.
            3.5.1.4.2.2. Performed by a private sector source and conversion to performance by a non-
            appropriated fund instrumentality (NAFI) as a public reimbursable source is contemplated
            under 10 U.S.C. 2492, to result in a NAF Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).
        3.5.1.4.3. Special consideration should be given to feasibility as a streamlined competition if
        any or all of the following criteria are relevant (a) the activities are highly technical; (b)
        extended/shift hours of operation are required; (c) there is the potential for government fur-
        nished property (GFP) issues (i.e., special training and vehicles). Each has the potential to
        cause significant problems during a competition, at implementation, and/or during post-com-
        petition accountability.
     3.5.1.5. Standard Competition: An activity will conduct a standard competition IAW 10 U.S.C.
     2461 (unless contemplating award to an AbilityOne nonprofit agency) if, on the competition start
     date any portion of an activity is performed by 10 or more DoD civilian employee authorizations
     and the agency cost estimate (ACE) will be based on 10 or more DoD civilian employee authori-
     zations.
26                                                                             AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


        3.5.1.6. If there will be 10 or more DoD civilian employee authorizations in the AF CA at the time
        of public announcement, notify Congress as required by 10 U.S.C. 2461 after preliminary plan-
        ning but prior to public announcement IAW paragraph 4.6.
     3.5.2. Prepare the Memorandum of Intent to Compete (Figure 4.1. – also referred to as the 9401
     memorandum). Develop the 9401 memorandum, with required attachments and forward through the
     Command Manpower and Organization (or equivalent), to AFMA for review. Additionally, the
     CSDP Part 2 and COMPARE model are forwarded to AFMA at this time (forward CSDP Parts 2 and
     3 to AF/A1MS only if requested). After AFMA review, Command Manpower and Organization (or
     equivalent) will staff the 9401 memorandum and forward to AF/A1 (courtesy copy AF/A1MS and
     AFMA/MAC). The Memorandum of Intent to Compete (9401) must include:
        3.5.2.1. All required attachments. See Figure 4.1. for format and a list of required attachments

        3.5.2.2. Updated Unit Manpower Document (UMD) and Manpower Detail.
        3.5.2.3. Major Milestones Schedule. Develop and submit milestone schedule dates used to build
        the DCAMIS record upon approval, i.e., Request for Proposal (RFP), Source Selection, Pub-
        lic-Private Competition. Include 45 calendar days for AF/A1MS staffing process in your major
        milestone schedule.
        3.5.2.4. Time limit waiver request, if applicable (see Figure 4.5. and paragraphs 5.3.2. and 5.4.1.)
        3.5.2.5. The command will get A-76 candidate credit for the entire number of authorizations in
        the activity being competed. In addition, AF/A1MS will return 75 percent (standard competition)
        or 90 percent (streamlined competition) of the funding to the command to fund the future service
        provider. Additionally, funding will be returned to the command to fund contract/LOO adminis-
        tration (administrators and quality assurance personnel).
        Example: A request to perform A-76 competition 100 authorizations. The 9401 Memorandum
        requests 3 authorizations be withheld for contract/LOO administration (Quality Assurance (QA)
        personnel and administrators). In this example the command will receive A-76 credit for 100
        authorizations. However, the AF will program out 73 authorizations or 75 percent of the 97 (97 =
        100 - 3). The AF returns to the command (via 595 account) funding for 76 authorizations (76 = 73
        + 3) to fund the service provider and conduct contract/LOO administration.
        3.5.2.6. When the activity is submitted, an estimated number of contract/LOO administrators and
        QA personnel must be identified on the 9401 Memorandum for programming purposes. There are
        numerous variables (e.g., the surveillance plan, shift work, complexity of work) that will impact
        the actual number of QA personnel and contract/LOO administrators required after the competi-
        tion, but to determine the estimated total number of contract/LOO administrators and QA person-
        nel the Command will:
           3.5.2.6.1. Determine the projected MEO staffing. Admittedly, MEOs are typically more than
           25 percent leaner then the size of the existing organization. However, to prevent the potential
           of understating future funding needed for the contract/LOO administration requirements the
           command will project the future MEO authorizations by taking the number of announced
           authorizations and multiplying by 75 percent for a standard or 90 percent for a streamlined
           competition. The result will become the projected MEO authorizations based on the AF Pub-
           lic-Private Competition Announcement Programming (paragraph 12.3.).
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                 27


           3.5.2.6.2. Use the projected MEO staffing and Table 3.1. to determine the estimated total
           number of QA personnel and contract/LOO administrators.
           3.5.2.6.3. From the estimated total number of QA personnel and contract/LOO administrators
           (paragraph 3.5.2.6.2.), use the projected MEO staffing and Table 3.2. to determine the esti-
           mated number of QA personnel. This number is then subtracted from the number in Table 3.1.
           to determine the estimated number of contract/LOO administrators.
For Example:
(1) If an activity has 100 announced positions and the projected MEO staffing is 75 (.75 x 100 = 75) posi-
tions, use Table 3.1. to obtain the estimated total number of contract/LOO administrator and QA person-
nel positions. For this example it is 3 positions.
(2) Then using Table 3.2., estimate the number of QA personnel. For this example it will be 2 positions.
(3) To get the estimated number of contract/LOO administrators, subtract the estimated number of QA
personnel (2 for this example) from the estimated total contract/LOO administrators and QA personnel (3
for this example) leaving the estimated number of contract/LOO administrators (1 for this example).

3.6. “Go/No-Go” Decision Review, Refinement, and Staffing Process.
     3.6.1. The Command Manpower and Organization Program Manager (PM) sends a draft HAF-A1M
     (AR) 9401 Memorandum of Intent to Compete a Commercial Activity for a Go decision and a Mem-
     orandum of Intent Not to Compete a Commercial Activity for a No-Go decision, to include all
     required attachments to AFMA/MAC NLT six months from P3 approval/notification, unless an
     extension has been granted by AF/A1MS.
     3.6.2. AFMA/MAC reviews the 9401 memorandum or No-Go memorandum IAW Preliminary Plan-
     ning Checklists and sends a Recommendations/Comments Matrix back to the Command Manpower
     and Organization PM IAW established timeline (see Table 3.4.)
     3.6.3. The Command Manpower and Organization PM reviews AFMA recommendations/ comments
     and makes necessary adjustments or provides clarification. Command changes/comments should be
     noted in the matrix and forwarded to AFMA/MAC for a second review along with the revised 9401
     memorandum or No-Go memorandum. AFMA/MAC must receive the command’s changes/com-
     ments IAW Table 3.4. A request for a second review beyond the established timeline will be
     addressed on a case-by-case basis with the Command Manpower and Organization PM to ensure cur-
     rency of the P3 deliverables will not be affected as a result of the delay. AF/A1MS must approve all
     extensions to established timelines, and Command Manpower and Organization PMs will demon-
     strate the extended staffing period will not undermine the currency of the P3 deliverables.
     3.6.4. AFMA/MAC conducts a second review and forwards final recommendations/comments matrix
     to Command Manpower and Organization PM IAW established timeline (Table 3.4.). AFMA/MAC
     also forwards the Recommendations/Comments Matrix, reflecting only disconnects (disconnect
     matrix) between AFMA and the respective command, to AF/A1MS for resolution, with a copy to
     Command Manpower and Organization PM and AFMA/CC. These disconnects provide AF/A1MS a
     heads up of potential issues.
     3.6.5. The Command Manpower and Organization PM staffs the 9401 memorandum or No-Go mem-
     orandum through the Command/CV (or equivalent) and forwards to AF/A1/A1M IAW Table 3.4.
     Delays in the staffing process beyond the established timeline will be addressed on a case-by-case
     basis with the Command Manpower and Organization PM to ensure currency of the P3 deliverables
     will not be affected as a result of the delay.
     3.6.6. AF/A1MS receives the 9401 memorandum or No-Go memorandum to initiate staffing:
        3.6.6.1. If AF/A1MS receives AFMA’s disconnect matrix, they will:
            3.6.6.1.1. Resolve disconnects (if needed) and staff the 9401 memorandum or No-Go memo-
            randum through HAF, working with OSD, if required.
            3.6.6.1.2. Recommend AF/A1/A1M approve/disapprove 9401 memorandum or No-Go mem-
            orandum.
            3.6.6.1.3. Forward approval/disapproval memorandum to the Command/CV (or equivalent)
            within established timeline.
        3.6.6.2. If AF/A1MS does not have AFMA’s disconnect matrix, AF/A1MS will forward the 9401
        memorandum or No-Go memorandum to AFMA/CC with notification to submitting Command
        Manpower and Organization PM that the 9401 memorandum or No-Go memorandum is being
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                 31

Request to Conduct Preliminary Planning – [Command], [Name of Function (Location)]
SUMMARY
1. Purpose. To obtain 4-letter coordination on AF draft response (Tab 1) to subject request.
2. Background. IAW OMB Circular A-76, dated 29 May 2003, an agency is required to conduct
preliminary planning prior to publicly announcing competitive sourcing initiatives to determine an
activity’s public-private competition viability.
3. Discussion.
   a. [Command] requests approval to conduct preliminary planning of [Name of Activity (Location)].
This preliminary planning initiative impacts [Number and Type] (for example: 63 civilian, 10 military,
3 contract workload) positions. The request and baseline unit manpower document (UMD) are at Tab 2.

   b. We request AF Functionals identify any issues regarding this request that would hinder
[Command’s] ability to receive future AF approval of this candidate for competitive sourcing (including
but not limited to UTC taskings, AEF requirements, career field sustainability, career progression,
overseas rotation, stressed career field data) and provide any specific information that will not support
this activity being considered for competitive sourcing.
  c. Functional input is crucial in the early stages of this process as the AF and [Command] will be
expending extensive resources to fulfill the AF’s obligation to compete commercial activities.
4. Recommendation. AF/A1MS sign memo at Tab 1.

SUBJECT: Memorandum of Intent Not to Compete a Commercial Activity [Name of Activity
         (Location)]

1. Based on the results of preliminary planning, the subject commercial activity is not a viable candidate
for competitive sourcing. This submission represents a [command]/CC position, which includes [wing/
installation/activity]/CC and command functional coordination.

2. Justification to Support a No-Go Decision: [Provide rationale supporting a No-Go decision].
Sourcing alternatives may also be addressed in this paragraph (for example, reengineering). The
subparagraphs below are examples of possible reasons for a No-Go decision and require substantial
justification and supporting documentation.

        a. Inherently Governmental: Preliminary Planning indicates activities being performed by this
activity (current or new mission) are inherently governmental [insert “why” IAW definition set by 31
U.S.C. 501]. Upon approval, change the Inherently Governmental and Commercial Activity (IGCA)
inventory coding, removing this activity from further consideration, and maintain the necessary
documentation to support this decision.

      b. UTC Taskings/Critical Skills: Address if UTC taskings or critical skills affect the rationale for
a No-Go decision. UTC taskings must be coordinated with the HAF functional, and critical skills must
be coordinated with the AF Career Field Manager.

       c. Impact Upon Readiness: Address if there is an impact upon readiness supporting the rationale
for a No-Go decision.

        d. Impact Upon Mobilization: Address if there is an impact upon mobilization supporting the
rationale for a No-Go decision.

        e. Baseline Cost: Provide the current one-year baseline cost of the existing organization as of
No-Go submission (calculated IAW the DoD Costing Manual). Provide supporting documentation when
market research indicates the baseline cost is significantly lower than anything available through the
private sector. Provide supporting documentation if market research indicates there is no interest or
capability for this activity/function. When the candidate encompasses multiple functions, provide
supporting documentation indicating that the grouping of activities was not the cause for lack of private
sector interest or capability.

Figure 3.6. Sample Memorandum of Intent Not to Compete a Commercial Activity (Continued).



      f. Labor Market Research: Address if labor market research indicates there is no viable civilian
workforce available to meet the demands of the positions being vacated (generally a large military
organization).


      g. Other Available Source: Address if preliminary planning identifies any other agreements (i.e.,
MOA, a host-tenant support agreement, etc.) already in place but not being performed. If the activity
plans to enforce the existing agreement, ensure market research supports this decision and doesn’t
indicate it would be more cost effective to continue with a competition.

     h. Prohibited by Law: Address if public law prohibits contracting out the activity(ies); however,
you must reference the law.


3. The cost to perform Preliminary Planning for this candidate was $[dollar amount].


4. Functional Coordination and Comments (if any): The command functional point(s) of contact is
[rank, name, office symbol, DSN, FAX, e-mail address] and concurs with a No-Go decision.

5. The [wing/installation/activity] point of contact is [rank, name, office symbol, DSN, FAX,
e-mail address]. Command point of contact is [rank, name, office symbol, DSN, FAX, e-mail address].

                                                 Chapter 4

         CANDIDATE NOMINATION/CHANGE/CANCELLATION, CONGRESSIONAL
               NOTIFICATION, AND INITIAL PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT

4.1. Policy. This chapter provides guidance for commands to nominate, change, or cancel a streamlined
or standard public-private competition, to make congressional notification, and to make the initial public
announcement.

4.2. Submitting Candidates. Initial and follow-on competition submissions are the result of preliminary
planning and reflect a command position. Nominations must have complete command coordination (to
include, as a minimum, the FAM, the Director of Manpower and Organization, as well as Contracting and
Personnel). All initial A-76 candidate submissions must follow the 9401 memorandum, RCS: HAF-A1M
(AR) 9401 format (Figure 4.1.).

4.3. Command-Level Approval Authority. The Command/CV (or equivalent) signs the initial candi-
date submission and any changes to this submission (i.e., changes in authorizations, scope, and type; with-
drawal; cancellation; and delays) and forwards to AF/A1. The Command/CV may delegate this authority
to the Command/A1 (or equivalent) who submits it to AF/A1M. Delegation lower than the Command/A1
(or equivalent) is not permitted.

4.4. Final Approval Authority. AF/A1 approval is required for all streamlined and standard public-pri-
vate competitions prior to proceeding with public announcement.
     4.4.1. AF/A1MS analyzes and develops the AF candidate staffing package. AF/A1 will approve/dis-
     approve candidates within 45 calendar days of receipt. AF/A1M will provide the approval/disap-
     proval memorandum to the Command Manpower and Organization (or equivalent), AF FAM, and
     AFMA as soon as AF coordination is complete.
     4.4.2. If an AF FAM nonconcurs with the candidate submission, the functional 2-digit provides writ-
     ten justification to AF/A1. AF/A1 will make the final decision regarding candidate submissions.

4.5. Release of Candidate Information. Candidate nominations will be identified as “For Official Use
Only” (FOUO) and no details relative to the candidate nomination may be released until after public
announcement unless approved by AF/A1M. The UMD is always FOUO and not releasable; however,
the number of positions under competition is releasable and will be summarized in the CSDP Part 1,
Project Scope Report. All information is no longer considered FOUO after public announcement and will
be released; with the exception of the UMD, Privacy Act, and private sector specific references (i.e.,
names associated with capability) which are not releasable. Authority for withholding candidate informa-
tion prior to public announcement is Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemption 3 or 5.

4.6. Congressional Notification.
     4.6.1. Congressional notification is required:
        4.6.1.1. IAW 10 U.S.C. 2461(b), as amended by Section 341 of the FY2006 National Defense
        Authorization Act, or successor provisions, congressional notification is required for public-pri-
        vate competitions with 10 or more DoD civilian employee authorizations. Congressional notifi-
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                  45


      cation is not required, if conversion is contemplated to an AbilityOne nonprofit agency.
      Congressional notification of any initiative may be accomplished due to Congressional interest or
      political sensitivity.
      4.6.1.2. IAW PL 105-261 Section 345 for multi-function competitions including Contrac-
      tor-Operated Civil Engineering Supply Stores (COCESS), SAF/LLP and AF/A1M must provide
      congressional notification to include rationale for including COCESS and estimated projected
      savings. COCESS cannot be combined with other services until 60 days after congressional noti-
      fication. GAO reviews public-private competitions that include COCESS and the competition
      may continue concurrently with GAO’s review. However, a competition decision may not be
      determined until GAO has completed this review.
      4.6.1.3. At the conclusion of any public-private competition affecting 10 or more DoD civilian
      employee authorizations a report to Congress (see Figure 4.6.) is required by 10 U.S.C. 2462, as
      amended by Section 341 of the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act or successor provi-
      sions, Public Law (PL) 109-163.
   4.6.2. Notification Responsibilities.
      4.6.2.1. SAF/LLP issues congressional notification after AF/A1 approval and prior to any public
      announcement. An example of this congressional notification letter is provided at Figure 4.6. In
      some cases, SAF/LLP may work directly with a command on congressional notification.
      4.6.2.2. Congressional notifications must be coordinated with organizations related to the A-76
      public-private competition to ensure releases are coordinated and timely.
      4.6.2.3. After being notified by AF/A1MS of the date and time that written congressional notifi-
      cation will be made, the Command/A1 (or equivalent) notifies the Command/CV (or designee).
      4.6.2.4. SAF/LLP notifies AF/A1MS immediately after the actual written congressional notifica-
      tion has been made.
      4.6.2.5. AF/A1MS immediately notifies the Command/A1 (or equivalent) with the actual date
      and time the written congressional notification was made.
      4.6.2.6. In cases where SAF/LLP does not conduct congressional notification, the Command/CV
      (or designee) will verbally contact the impacted local congressional delegation (either member(s)
      or staff) and provide a brief explanation of the initiative. The A-76 Candidate Synopsis (Figure
      4.3.) or similar language can be used.

4.7. Public Announcement.
   4.7.1. Within 7 calendar days of the date on the AF/A1 approval letter, the commander will make a
   public announcement (Figure 4.7.) to all directly affected government personnel (and their represen-
   tatives) followed by the Contracting Officer posting the public announcement using FedBizOpps.gov
   (Figure 4.4.). The Contracting Officer posting of the public announcement on FedBizOpps.gov, is
   the official start date of the public-private competition. DCAMIS requires public announcement to be
   at least one day prior to the official start date.
   4.7.2. If a press release or other form of publicity is desired, these must be made after the directly
   affected employees and their union representatives are notified. This applies to all initiatives regard-
   less of whether congressional notification is required.
46                                                                            AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


     4.7.3. As determined by the command, formal announcement for local and/or state officials may be
     made at the installation/activity level.

4.8. Post Public Announcement Actions.
     4.8.1. Create DCAMIS records within 7 calendar days after public announcement is made. Com-
     mands and installations are required to accurately maintain DCAMIS data, IAW the DCAMIS User’s
     Guide, throughout the duration of the public-private competition and resulting performance periods.
     For follow-on competitions, a new DCAMIS record will be created.
     4.8.2. DCAMIS information will be made available to the public upon request via OSD under the
     provisions of the FOIA.
     4.8.3. Identify all authorizations in an announced initiative as “under competition” in the IGCA RSC
     field of MPES using the appropriate code. UMD changes/reductions are prohibited in this CA until
     completion of the initiative.
     4.8.4. The servicing Contracting Office posts the CSDP, Part 1, on FedBizOpps.gov. Requests for
     CSDP Part 2 (which includes the manpower matrix of affected positions) and Part 3 (excluding the
     UMD) can be made through the Contracting Officer. A formal request through FOIA is not required.

4.9. Changes to or Cancellations of Candidates/Initiatives.
     4.9.1. AF/A1M approval is required for all changes to the initial candidate submission.
     4.9.2. For candidates submitted but not yet approved by AF/A1M:
        4.9.2.1. Changes are not permitted during the AF staffing of initial candidate submissions.
        4.9.2.2. AF/A1M will not hold candidates to allow commands to modify data. Commands will
        withdraw a candidate to make modifications and then resubmit as a new candidate since modifica-
        tions must be supported by an updated CSDP quantifying the changes and a corrected announce-
        ment package.
     4.9.3. For initiatives approved by AF. Requests for changes to already approved initiatives (Figure
     4.8.) must reflect a command position and include the approved A-76 Manpower Detail (Figure 4.2.)
     with the requested changes noted in separate columns. (Changes may include changes in scope,
     authorizations, initiative type, etc.) Changing the type of initiative from a standard competition to a
     streamlined competition or changing the completion FY negatively impacts programmed savings and
     may create a bill for the command.
     4.9.4. Cancellation of a Streamlined or Standard Competition. Commands submit request for cancel-
     lation using the format in Figure 4.9. AF/A1 must obtain DoD CSO approval, in writing, to cancel a
     streamlined or standard competition. After a cancellation request is approved:
        4.9.4.1. The Contracting Officer will publish a cancellation notice that includes rationale for the
        cancellation on FedBizOpps.gov. No cancellation is required prior to public announcement of a
        public-private competition.
        4.9.4.2. The commander or designated representative will notify directly affected government
        personnel and representatives of directly affected employees (following required actions in Figure
        4.10.).
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                  47


   4.9.5. Solicitation Cancellation. The Contracting Officer will be responsible for canceling a solicita-
   tion IAW the FAR and will publish a cancellation notice on FedBizOpps.gov. The HRA/CPF, along
   with functional area managers, will notify directly affected employees and their representatives of the
   cancellation. The cancellation of a solicitation does not result in the cancellation of a streamlined or
   standard competition.

4.10. Roles and Responsibilities.
   4.10.1. SAF/LLP is responsible for issuing congressional notification and notifying AF/A1MS
   immediately after notification is made.
   4.10.2. AF/A1 will:
       4.10.2.1. Approve/disapprove an A-76 public-private competition.

Memorandum of Intent to Compete a Commercial Activity

MEMORANDUM FOR AF/A1 [or AF/A1M if from Command/A1 (or equivalent)]

FROM: [COMMAND/CV or Command/A1 (or equivalent) if so delegated]

SUBJECT: RCS:HAF-A1M (AR) 9401, Memorandum of Intent to Compete a Commercial Activity [Insert Location,
         Function (activity title), and either Streamlined or Standard public-private competition] (The activity title must
         be consistent with Initiative Title to be reflected in DCAMIS)


1. The Command/CV [or A1] requests AF/A1 [or A1M] approval of subject candidate for [streamlined or standard]
competition. This submission includes the [wing/installation/activity]/CC, [functional/CC (if applicable)] and command
functional coordination. The command has reviewed the activity for conditions that could preclude AF approval and provides
the following:

  a. UTC Taskings: No UTC taskings exist for this candidate [or “Existing UTC taskings will be relocated to XXXX
AFB.”].

   b. Impact Upon Readiness: The resulting agency tender or contract will not have a negative impact upon Readiness. (If
there is an impact upon Readiness, explain what action(s) are being taken to mitigate the impact.)

  c. Impact Upon Mobilization: The resulting agency tender or contract will not have a negative impact upon the installations
ability to mobilize. (If there is an impact upon the ability to mobilize, explain what actions are being taken to mitigate the
negative impact.)

    d. Critical Skills: We are unaware of any critical skills issues for this candidate to include unfavorable rotation or career
progression [or “Potential issues affecting critical skills may surface during coordination; however, our command position
is XXXX.”]

   e. Inherently Governmental or Exempt From Public-Private Competition: This activity is neither inherently governmental
nor a commercial activity that is exempt from contract performance [or “This activity is currently designated as inherently
governmental, exempt from contracting, or mission essential services; however, our command position is…” (must
provide rationale why the activity is not considered inherently governmental by your command or why commercial
activities that are coded as not appropriate for contract performance are being considered for public-private competition.
If any work is mission essential services and must be continued during a crisis, contingency, or other situation where
personnel can be exposed to hostile fire, explain how the solicitation, contract, and operational plans will ensure continued
performance by personnel other than the private sector contractor.)]

   f. Impact on Small Businesses or Incumbent Private Sector Contractors: This initiative includes [or does not include more
than one activity, more than one location, or existing contracted workload]. The associated activities, CMEs & PECs are
contained in the Manpower Detail Spreadsheet). The CSDP Part 1, provides more detailed information. (Briefly discuss
number/type of contracts included. Attach a copy of the determination and findings documents to justify either
“Bundling” (under the FAR and Small Business Act), “Consolidation” (under the DFARS), or both.)

identifying whether this is a new public-private competition or MEO follow-on competition (or portions thereof, positions
using PBD 710 funding, or any other special programmatic actions.]

   l. Preliminary Planning: All preliminary planning activities have been accomplished and we intend to complete this
competition within [90 calendar days for Streamlined Competition or 12 months for Standard Competition.]. (If additional
time will be required, submit the time limit waiver justification IAW Figure 4.5.)

SAF/LLP

Washington, DC 20330-1160

[Appropriate Congressional Member/Title/Address]

Dear [Name]

This is to inform you that the Commander of [command] is initiating a [multi-function or single-function or multi-location]
standard competition of the [list CA(s)] activity at [installation] Air Force Base, [state]. The standard competition affects
[number] military and [number] Appropriated Fund civilians and [number] Non-appropriated Fund civilians. Statutes
require Congressional notification when a standard competition affects 10 or more DoD civilians. The estimated cost of
performing this standard competition is $[dollar amount]. Funding to cover the cost of this analysis will come from funds
allocated to [command] in their 595 account. The estimated completion date for this standard competition is [month YYYY].
Performance of this standard competition is not the result of a decision to impose predetermined constraints or limitations on
Department of Defense (DoD) employees in terms of man-years, end strengths, full-time equivalent positions, or maximum
number of employees.

This standard competition will be conducted in compliance with procedures outlined in the Office of Management and Budget
Circular (OMBC) A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities, and the evaluation factors required by 10 U.S.C. 2461 and
Section 8013 of the Defense Appropriations Act for FY 2007 (or successor provisions in annual statutes). Circular A-76
reaffirms the government’s policy to rely on the private sector for commercial services when practical and cost effective.
When commercial activities do not require agency performance, e.g., for national defense reasons, a comparison of relative
cost between agency and private sector performance will determine the most cost-effective method of operation.

If the activity is contracted, OMBC A-76 procedures require the private sector contractor to offer adversely affected civilian
employees the Right of First Refusal for employment openings to positions (under the contract) for which they are qualified.
Since DoD is sensitive to the personal impact this action may have on civilian employees, the DoD Program for Stability of
Civilian Employment ensures every effort is made to help adversely affected civilian employees who desire placement
assistance. These employees are registered in the Defense-wide computerized Priority Placement Program. Registrants under
this program receive placement rights to vacancies within DoD (other Federal agencies are also solicited). When adversely
affected civilian employees must relocate to continue Federal employment, transportation and moving expenses are paid by
the government.

[Insert COCESS paragraph when applicable:] This multi-function standard competition includes a contractor-operated civil
engineering supply store (COCESS). It has been determined that including COCESS in this standard competition will be in
the best interest of the Air Force and American taxpayer. We reviewed this particular COCESS and determined it could be
included in this multi-function standard competition because [insert summarized facts that satisfy statutory criteria].

We will be glad to provide any further information you may require concerning this action.

                                                          Sincerely,

                                                        [Insert appropriate signature block]

ANNOUNCEMENT


[Base] AFB, [ACTIVITY(S)]
[EXAMPLE: BLYTHEVILLE AFB, GROUNDS MAINTENANCE]



The [wing/installation/activity] Commander, [rank and name], of [command] has announced a
[streamlined competition or standard competition] of [activity(s)]. It impacts a total of [number] DoD
personnel ([number] officers, [number] enlisted, [number] civilians, and [number] NAF civilians).
The [streamlined or standard competition] was announced on [AF approval date] and is projected for
completion by [month and fiscal year]. The Component Competitive Sourcing Official is [name of
CCSO], the Contracting Officer is [name of Contracting Officer], and the Agency Tender Official is
[name of ATO, if applicable].


This [streamlined or standard competition] will be conducted in compliance with the Air Force policies
in AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program that implements the Office of Management and Budget
Circular (OMBC) A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR). The Commercial Activities Program reaffirms the government’s policy to rely on the private
sector for needed commercial services. To ensure that the American people receive maximum value for
their tax dollars, commercial activities should be subject to the forces of public-private competition.


When a public-private competition between agency and private sector performance determines private
sector performance is more cost effective, OMBC A-76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation require the
private sector contractor to offer adversely affected DoD civilian and NAF employees the Right of First
Refusal for employment openings to positions (under the contract) for which they are qualified. Since
DoD is sensitive to the personal impact this action may have on civilian employees, the DoD Program for
Stability of Civilian Employment ensures every effort is made to help adversely affected civilian
employees who desire placement assistance. These employees are registered in the Defense-wide
computerized Priority Placement Program. Registrants under this program receive placement rights to
vacancies within DoD (other Federal agencies are also solicited). When adversely affected civilian
employees must relocate to continue Federal employment, transportation and moving expenses are paid
by the government.

                                                Chapter 5

                       PUBLIC-PRIVATE COMPETITION PROCEDURES

5.1. Policy. This chapter provides guidance for streamlined and standard public-private competitions.
The “start date” is the date of public announcement and the “end date” is the date when all SLCF/SCF cer-
tifications are complete, signifying a performance decision.

5.2. General:
   5.2.1. As stated in 10 U.S.C. 2463 and Public Law, DoD civilian employees may perform a new
   requirement, an expansion to an existing AF CA, or an activity performed by the private sector with-
   out conducting a public-private competition. A public-private competition is not required for those
   activities excluded in paragraph 1.3.
   5.2.2. An MEO must be staffed with an all-civilian workforce. The decision to conduct a public-pri-
   vate competition (streamlined or standard) for an activity represents a management decision that the
   work is not military essential or that adequate contingency plans and contract provisions (e.g., training
   military members to replace private sector employees) can be written and executed to cover all contin-
   gencies. If an AF CA containing military authorizations is retained in-house as a result of a stream-
   lined competition, all military authorizations will be retained in-house until they can be converted to
   civilian authorizations during the first available budget exercise.
   5.2.3. Three separate costs will be developed for each public-private competition. Two Baseline
   Costs (a) Preliminary Planning Baseline Costs (PBC) already completed in P3 and (b) an Adjusted
   Baseline Costs (ABC) addressed and (c) the Agency Cost Estimate (ACE) addressed in paragraph
   8.3.2. Use a separate COMPARE file for each.
       5.2.3.1. The ABC will be based on decisions made between the public-private competition start
       date and end date (i.e., date of the performance decision) that may alter the baseline costs identi-
       fied in the PBC. Changes made to the ABC after the performance decision will require recertifi-
       cation prior to the final decision. No changes are permitted to a certified ABC after the final
       decision date. The ABC will reflect changes to the PBC resulting from:
           5.2.3.1.1. Modifications to the scope of the competition (e.g., addition/deletion of positions).
           5.2.3.1.2. The requirements stated in the final solicitation, such as performance periods and
           identification of government furnished items (aka: common/wash costs).
           5.2.3.1.3. Updates to COMPARE, such as cost factor changes and version updates.
           5.2.3.1.4. Corrections to erroneous information or data.
       5.2.3.2. Document the costs for contract administration and Letter of Obligation (LOO) adminis-
       tration based on Table 5.1. IAW the DoD Costing Manual and more current OMB, DoD, and AF
       costing guidance.
       5.2.3.3. The ABC will be compared to the selected service provider to determine savings.
       5.2.3.4. Report the ABC data in DCAMIS.
   5.2.4. To mitigate, avoid, or eliminate conflict of interest issues, firewalls must be established for the
   P3 Team, PWS Team, MEO Team, SSEB, etc. Firewalls serve to separate roles that require neutrality
62                                                                             AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


     (such as drafting the ground rules of a public-private competition) from those where advocacy is per-
     missible (such as assisting one side in the resulting public-private competition).
     5.2.5. The Contracting Officer will ensure all persons involved in the source selection process are
     briefed and knowledgeable about the source selection process IAW the Mandatory Procedure 5315.3,
     Source Selection, at FAR 15.101-2.
     5.2.6. Waiver requests to AFIs, policy directives, etc., will be submitted, in writing, through the com-
     mand-level FAM to the AF FAM (AF-level policy waivers).
     5.2.7. The Unit Manpower Document (UMD) either by itself or as part of the CSDP Part 3 is not
     releasable under FOIA. The UMD is source selection sensitive and is also operationally sensitive. It
     will not be included in the solicitation, technical library, or any other publicly accessible form.
     5.2.8. The decision to conduct a public-private competition has an impact on the responsibilities of
     many staff and functional offices. Recommend establishing a Competitive Sourcing Management
     Steering Group (CSMSG) at installation and command levels consisting of representatives from the
     servicing Manpower and Organization activity, servicing Human Resources Advisor (HRA)/Servic-
     ing Civilian Personnel Officer (or Human Resources Officer (HRO for NAF)), servicing Military Per-
     sonnel Flight/Element, Contracting, Financial Management Flight, Staff Judge Advocate, Civil
     Engineering, Public Affairs, and the functional offices of primary responsibility. The members pro-
     vide guidance and respond to requests related to their area of expertise that may have an impact on the
     successful completion of the public-private competition. The steering group is available to advise all
     teams associated with the public-private competition process, and will not share source selection sen-
     sitive information, and will maintain established firewalls between all teams.
     5.2.9. If a private-public competition is expected to exceed OMB time limits, including any extension
     from a previously approved time limit waiver extension, an additional time limit extension request
     (Figure 5.3. and Figure 5.5.) must be submitted to the CCSO. The CCSO (without delegation) will
     approve or forward to the DoD CSO who in-turn notifies the Deputy Director for Management, OMB,
     in writing, as applicable.
     5.2.10. Air Force units may not compete (submit a Public Reimbursable Tender) for work being done
     elsewhere within DoD unless submitting the sole Agency Tender for DoD. (This does not apply to
     NAFIs seeking to offer services under 10 U.S.C. 2492)

5.3. Streamlined Competition Process (Figure 5.1.).
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                 63


Figure 5.1. The Streamlined Competition Process Flowchart.




   5.3.1. Activities must perform a streamlined competition if any portion of the activity is performed by
   less than 10 DoD civilian employee authorizations on the competition start date and the agency cost
   estimate (ACE) will be based on less than 10 DoD civilian employee authorizations. For specific
   streamlined criteria see paragraph 3.5.1.4.
   5.3.2. Streamlined Competition Time Limit. A streamlined competition will not exceed 90 calendar
   days from public announcement (start date) to performance decision (end date) unless the CCSO
   grants a time limit waiver for an additional 45 days before public announcement Figure 4.5.) The
   CCSO may grant a time limit waiver only if the CCSO expects the activity to create an MEO or issue
   a solicitation. For a streamlined competition resulting in a private sector performance decision based
   on a developed contractor cost estimate, a solicitation will be made IAW paragraph 9.3.1.3.
   5.3.3. A Performance-based Work Statement (PWS) and Performance Plan will be developed IAW
   AFI 63-124, paragraph 1.4.4.4. and provided to the three individuals preparing the ABC, ACE and the
   estimated cost of private sector performance, usually the Contracting Officer.
   5.3.4. Appointed Costing Officials. Three individuals will be identified to prepare cost estimates and
   maintain firewalls between these individuals. After public announcement, these individuals will cal-
   culate, compare, and certify costs based upon the scope and requirements of the activity to determine
   a cost-effective performance decision by completing the SLCF.
64                                                                            AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


        5.3.4.1. Individuals preparing the ACE (see paragraph 8.3.2.) and ABC will calculate the cost of
        performing the activity to complete COMPARE SLCF Lines 1, 2, 3 (limited to existing awarded
        contracts currently supporting the activity): 4 and 6 using a phase-in period, base year, and four
        option years IAW the DoD Costing Manual and more current OMB, DoD, and AF costing guid-
        ance. The preparer of the ABC should be the Baseline Costing Official who developed the PBC.
        The preparer of the ACE may not be the Baseline Costing Official who developed the PBC and
        will develop the ABC.
        5.3.4.2. Preparer of the Cost of Private Sector/Public Reimbursable Performance. The contract-
        ing officer will obtain a contractor cost estimate and enter this amount on Line 7 of the SLCF,
        using documented market research. Estimated costs may also be determined for performing the
        activity with a public reimbursable source by calculating (or requesting that a public reimbursable
        source calculate) SLCF Lines 1a, 2a, 3a (limited to awarded contracts), 4a, and 6a. Enter and cer-
        tify an estimated contract price or public reimbursable cost on SLCF Line 7 IAW the DoD Costing
        Manual and more current OMB, DoD, and AF costing guidance. The contracting officer will not
        share cost information with the preparer of the ACE.
        5.3.4.3. Decision Certifying Official. The performance decision certification will be signed by a
        government official independent of the (a) preparer of the Private Sector/Public Reimbursable
        Performance costs and (b) preparer of the ACE.
     5.3.5. General Costing Guidance for COMPARE. The following information will be provided, in
     writing, to the costing officials.
        5.3.5.1. Performance Periods. A phase-in period, base year, and four option years will be used to
        calculate costs.
        5.3.5.2. Due Date. Identify the due date for submission of the cost estimates.
        5.3.5.3. Phase-in Costs. Phase-in costs will be documented and included in cost estimates in the
        first performance period.
        5.3.5.4. Administration Costs. Document the costs for contract administration and Letter of Obli-
        gation (LOO) administration based on Table 5.1.

Figure 5.2. The Standard Competition Process Flowchart.




     5.4.1. Standard Competition Time Limit. A standard competition will not exceed 12 months from
     public announcement (start date) to performance decision (end date) unless the DoD CSO (without
     delegation) grants a time limit waiver (Figure 4.5.). The time involved in a contest/protest before or
     after the performance decision is not counted against this time limit.
        5.4.1.1. Before the public announcement of each standard competition, the DoD CSO may grant
        a time limit waiver (typically reserved for large, unusually complex, or multi-location/function
        studies), in writing, allowing a specific standard competition to exceed the 12-month time limit by
        no more than six months, for a maximum of 18 months from public announcement (start date) to
        performance decision (end date).
        5.4.1.2. Time limit waivers are granted only if the DoD CSO expects the standard competition to
        be particularly complex and signs the time limit waiver before public announcement. The time
        limit waiver must be submitted by the CCSO, signed by the DoD CSO and provided to the Deputy
        Director for Management, OMB, before public announcement.
     5.4.2. Information (including historical data and the structure of a prior MEO) developed by the ATO
     and MEO Team is considered source selection sensitive information and will be protected IAW FAR,
     Subpart 3.104. Historical data or other existing information developed by other than the ATO or MEO
     Team should be made available to all prospective providers, unless it would discourage public-private
     competition or place the agency (the MEO) at a competitive disadvantage in preparing the agency’s
     MEO and Agency Tender. The UMD, the Government’s independent cost estimate, and the available
     budget will not be disclosed to prospective offerors because it will prejudice the public-private com-

competition and the competition will not determine a performance decision by the CSO approved end date.
2 A “time limit extension” is necessary if a time limit waiver was neither requested nor approved prior to start date of
competition and the competition will not determine a performance decision in accordance with the Circular’s time limit
requirement of 12 months from the start date.

    PERFORMANCE-BASED WORK STATEMENT (PWS) AND PERFORMANCE PLAN
                          DEVELOPMENT

6.1. Policy. This chapter provides guidance for development of the PWS and Performance Plan. A PWS
and Performance Plan will be developed or modified for all activities in a streamlined and standard com-
petition. When this chapter conflicts with the FAR, the FAR takes precedence.

6.2. The Performance-based Work Statement will:
   6.2.1. Be developed IAW the FAR, AFI 63-124, Performance-Based Services Acquisition, including
   information identified during P3 (paragraph 3.3.4.).
   6.2.2. Not be initiated prior to public announcement. However, where a PWS already exists for the
   original competition (follow-on competitions), the PWS is required to be maintained IAW Post Com-
   petition Accountability (Chapter 10). Expired MEOs (where a follow-on competition was not con-
   ducted prior to the original competition's last performance period), P3 will capture the required
   services and, if this is a suitable candidate for competition, a new PWS will be developed after
   announcement of the A-76 competition.
   6.2.3. Not include new or upgraded requirements that increase operating costs beyond the projected
   available funding as forecasted and documented by the Financial Management Flight.
   6.2.4. Be based on historical and projected workload data (to include surge and other requirements).
   A minimum of 12 months of historical workload is desired. Man-hours will not be used as workload
   data. Increases or decreases in workload due to projected mission changes will be addressed and an
   analysis of the mission changes will be kept on file. Refer to AFMAN 38-208, Volume 1, AF Man-
   agement Engineering Program (MEP) - Processes and Volume 2, AF Management Engineering Pro-
   gram (MEP) – Quantification Tools, for instructions on how to use and collect workload data.
   Provide exercise workload data separately. Do not combine exercise workload data with surge work-
   load data.
   6.2.5. Address unique/specific skills necessary to perform the service.
   6.2.6. Address Government Furnished Property. Decisions to include government furnished property
   will be IAW FAR, Part 45. Any decisions to provide government furnished property should take into
   account the costs over the life of the contract including disposal. The Financial Management Flight
   will use Table 6.1. of this instruction or a cost-benefit analysis as a basis for determining if providing
   government property to a prospective offeror is in the best interest of the government. Current, accu-
   rate, and complete information justifying the cost-benefit determination will be maintained in the pub-
   lic-private competition file. The determination to provide government property will not be used to
   influence the outcome of the public-private competition. The ATO, MEO Team, and any individual
   assisting in the development of the AT will not be involved in the determination to provide GFP. All
   government furnished property must be accurately listed in the PWS. Table 6.1. provides guidance
   for determining whether to furnish government property to prospective offerors. Determinations to
   provide GFP will be justified and approved by the Command/CV or designated representative.
   6.2.7. Address Support Agreements.
80                                                                            AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


        6.2.7.1. Agencies providing support to AF or to other DoD components or Federal agencies
        through support agreements or other arrangements (e.g., MOA and MOU) will ensure the PWS
        includes this workload and is coordinated with all affected components and agencies. The base
        Logistics Readiness Flight will evaluate existing agreements to determine if there will be an
        impact and provide evaluation and documentation to the Contracting Office.
        6.2.7.2. If the tenant is receiving service “above and beyond” the minimum prescribed level of
        service, the tenant must fund the extra level of service to the service provider, subject to the
        interservice support agreement between the two organizations. Funding for the extra level of ser-
        vice must be addressed in the interservice agreement and contract line items, as appropriate.
        Questions regarding level of service should be referred to the servicing Logistics Readiness Flight.
     6.2.8. Clearly separate workload for NAF activities by fund type (Category A and B). The solicita-
     tion must have offerors provide a separate line item proposal/bid for each fund type. (This program is
     not applicable to Category C NAF activities. See paragraph 1.3.4.)
     6.2.9. Include labor union involvement in the PWS development. Labor union representatives, on
     behalf of directly affected civilian employees, may participate in the development and preparation of
     the PWS providing technical support to the PWS Team. At least monthly, during the development of
     the PWS, management solicits the views of employees and/or their representatives for inputs to the
     PWS (10 U.S.C. 2461). They may participate in meetings, in an advisory capacity, except where man-
     agement decisions are made or source selection information is discussed. Directly affected employees
     not represented by labor unions may appoint a representative(s). Final decisions regarding the PWS
     are at the discretion of management.
     6.2.10. Be issued on FedBizOpps.gov, in draft, for review by the public and private sector in order to
     solicit inputs from any potential offeror(s), time permitting. Early exchanges of information such as
     pre-proposal conferences, site visits, and others, as discussed in FAR, Subpart 15.201, are highly
     encouraged. The MEO Team will not have access to any draft or final PWS prior to posting on Fed-
     BizOpps.gov.
     6.2.11. Address the relationship between the AF and the service provider concerning responsibilities
     for environmental, safety, and occupational health (ESOH) programs. Specifically address, among
     other things, who is responsible for surveillance and monitoring of work areas for worker safety and
     health protection and compliance with ESOH standards. See AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials
     Management for Hazardous Material reporting requirements for contract performance, and to identify
     requirements for services that support the Hazardous Materials Management Process, e.g. base sup-
     ply.
     6.2.12. Ensure the requirements in DoDI 3020.37 and DoDI 3020.41 are identified in the solicitation
     including but not limited to:
        6.2.12.1. The PWS includes:
            6.2.12.1.1. Description of Services/General Information;
            6.2.12.1.2. Services Summary;
            6.2.12.1.3. Government Furnished Property and Services, if applicable;
        6.2.12.2. The solicitation will include:
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                   81


           6.2.12.2.1. A requirement for the contractor to provide a contingency plan for those tasks
           identified as mission essential and to provide a reasonable assurance of continuation during
           crisis conditions.
           6.2.12.2.2. A requirement for the contractor to identify employees that have military mobili-
           zation recall commitments and confirmation they have plans for replacing those employees in
           the event of mobilization.
           6.2.12.2.3. A requirement that information on contractor-employee benefits due to war exi-
           gencies be fully developed by the contractor and provided in writing to all affected contractor
           employees.
           6.2.12.2.4. Standardized clauses to ensure efficient deployment, visibility, protection, autho-
           rized levels of health service and other support sustainment; and
           6.2.12.2.5. Information regarding how the clauses are to flow down for existing MEO subcon-
           tracts.

6.3. Performance Plan. The Performance Plan is an evolving document and identifies objectives and a
strategy and methods of inspection (performance thresholds, measurements, metrics, etc.) to be used
regardless of the service provider (agency, public reimbursable, or private sector), as well as the required
reports and resources. A well-prepared Performance Plan is key to the successful inspection of the ser-
vice provider IAW AFI 63-124, paragraph 1.4.4.4. and post-competition accountability ensuring the ser-
vice provider’s own Quality Control Plan is effective. The Performance Plan:
   6.3.1. Is required to be developed for every streamlined and standard competition.
   6.3.2. All or part may be included as part of the solicitation.

6.4. Special Considerations.
   6.4.1. Personnel, either private sector contractor or government, outside the activity being competed
   can assist in developing a PWS and Performance Plan as long as this assistance does not result in a
   conflict of interest, as outlined in the FAR, Subpart 9.505-2, Preparing Specifications or Work State-
   ments. Private sector contractor and/or government personnel working on the development of the
   PWS are prohibited from participating in the development of the AT
   6.4.2. Security Clearances.
       6.4.2.1. Process facility security clearances for private sector contractor/public reimbursable
       employees IAW AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Program Management. Service provider
       employees who do not require access to classified information for work performance, but require
       entry into restricted areas of the installation, may be authorized unescorted entry only when the
       provisions of AFI 31-601 are met.
       6.4.2.2. Commanders will ensure in-house employees obtain security clearances only when a
       bona fide requirement exists.

6.5. Roles and Responsibilities.
   6.5.1. Command/CV (or designated representative) will approve written justification to provide, or
   not provide, GFP.
82                                                                            AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


     6.5.2. Command Manpower and Organization (or designate representative) will ensure the PWS
     and Performance Plan are IAW command procedures and scheduled milestone dates.
     6.5.3. Functional Area Manager (FAM) will:
        6.5.3.1. Verify the PWS does not include requirements that would increase an offer (including AT
        costs) beyond the current available funding.
        6.5.3.2. Work with the servicing CPF to consult with and consider directly affected civilian
        employees’ views during the development and preparation of the PWS (10 U.S.C. 2461).
     6.5.4. Servicing Manpower and Organization Activity will, as a member of the PWS Team, assist
     in defining the requirements and workload data for the PWS.
     6.5.5. Logistics Readiness Squadron will evaluate existing support agreements to determine if there
     will be an impact and provide evaluation and documentation to the Contracting Office.
     6.5.6. Servicing Contracting Office will assist in developing the PWS.
     6.5.7. Servicing Financial Management Flight will use Table 6.1., initially, to determine if provid-
     ing government property to a private sector contractor is or is not in the best interest of the govern-
     ment. If Table 6.1. is not sufficient to determine if providing government property is in the best
     interest of the government, then a cost benefit analysis is accomplished following economic analysis
     instructions in AFMAN 65-506, Economic Analysis, will be accomplished.
     6.5.8. Human Resources Advisor (HRA)/Servicing Civilian Personnel Officer (or Human
     Resources Officer (HRO for NAF)) will:
        6.5.8.1. Review any personnel qualification requirements in the PWS to determine the feasibility
        of recruiting personnel with like qualifications and to ensure that the requirements do not exceed
        those set by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) qualification standards.
        6.5.8.2. Consult with and consider directly affected civilian employees’ views during the develop-
        ment and preparation of the PWS (10 U.S.C. 2461).
            6.5.8.2.1. Document how consultations are accomplished and retain as part of the public-pri-
            vate competition documentation.
            6.5.8.2.2. For directly affected civilian employees represented by unions, consultation with
            union representatives fulfills this requirement. Alternatively, this requirement can be met by
            including union representatives on the PWS development team.
            6.5.8.2.3. For directly affected civilian employees not represented by unions, consultation
            may be accomplished through group meetings or by a representative(s) designated by the
            employees. Alternatively, this requirement can be met by including employees/representa-
            tives on the PWS development team.
     6.5.9. Labor Union Involvement. Labor organizations, on behalf of directly affected civilian
     employees, may provide advisory support to the PWS Team and participate in meetings in an advisory
     capacity, except where management decisions are made or source selection information is discussed.
     6.5.10. Directly Affected Employees , if not represented by the labor union, may appoint a represen-
     tative(s).
     6.5.11. PWS Team Leader will:

     6.5.12.1. Avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest (firewall issues). Directly affected gov-
     ernment personnel (and representatives) may participate on the PWS Team; however, members of
     the PWS Team (including, but not limited to, advisors and consultants) will not take part in AT
     development or be a member of the MEO Team.
     6.5.12.2. Develop the PWS including supporting workload data, performance standards, and any
     information relating to the activity being competed with assistance from the servicing Manpower

                                SOLICITATION CONSIDERATIONS

7.1. Policy. This chapter provides guidance on solicitation considerations necessary when conducting
public-private competitions. In principle, the acquisition process for selecting a service provider uses the
same process as for any other service. In practice, however, there are some unique aspects of the A-76
process that drive differences in how a Request For Proposal (RFP) is structured and offerors evaluated.
An integrated team approach with functional representation, Manpower, Contracting, Finance, Personnel,
and the Judge Advocate, is essential to a successful A-76 public-private competition. When developing
and issuing a solicitation for a standard competition, the Contracting Officer will comply with the FAR
and the following:
   7.1.1. Review and Release of Information. Posting a draft of the PWS or solicitation for public
   review and comment, including review and comment by directly affected government personnel (and
   representatives), is encouraged. All releases of the PWS and solicitation, including drafts, will be by
   the Contracting Officer. Information that is developed by the ATO or MEO Team will be considered
   source selection sensitive; all other information related to the performance or productivity of the
   incumbent organization, historical data, or other existing information will be made available to all
   prospective providers. The UMD, Government independent cost estimate, and projected budget will
   not be disclosed to prospective offerors because doing so prejudices the public-private competition
   and artificially limits contract offers. In A-76, the Government needs contract offers that derive from
   the private sectors’ own experience and assessment, rather than being steered to the Government’s
   proposed solution by Government forecasts and budget planning.
   7.1.2. FAR Provisions. The Contracting Officer, in consultation with the acquisition strategy team,
   will determine the acquisition strategy IAW FAR, Part 7. When the agency is the incumbent service
   provider, the Contracting Officer will comply with FAR, Subpart 7.305(c) regarding the right of first
   refusal. Consolidation and bundling analysis are completed IAW DFARS, Subpart 207.107 and FAR,
   Subpart 7.107(e).
       7.1.2.1. Solicitations. Solicitations are issued IAW the FAR and this instruction. In addition, Sec-
       tion L, Instructions, Conditions and Notices to Offerors, and Section M, Evaluation Factors for
       Awards, of the solicitation will clearly identify what applies/does not apply to each offeror (AT,
       private sector, or public reimbursable source). Section L will include a requirement for offerors to
       submit a cross-reference compliance matrix (see Figure 7.1.).
       7.1.2.2. The acquisition and source selection processes. The Contracting Officer will complete
       the solicitation IAW FAR, Part 12 (incorporating parts 13, 14, 15, if appropriate). All evaluation
       factors will be clearly identified in the solicitation. To the extent practicable, evaluation factors
       will be limited to commonly used factors (e.g., Mission Capability, Proposal Risk, Past Perfor-
       mance and Cost/Price). No solicitation will include evaluation factors or sub factors that could
       provide an unfair advantage for or inherently benefit a prospective provider, public or private.
       7.1.2.3. Not-to-Exceed Cost Clause. Because of the harm to the Government that will result from
       steering contract offers to artificial solutions, solicitations shall not include a not-to-exceed cost
       clause.
       7.1.2.4. Statutory restrictions on DoD public-private competitions.
86                                                                             AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


            7.1.2.4.1. Because 10 U.S.C. 2461 requires decisions based on lowest cost only (i.e., the “best
            value” outcome as defined in FAR Subpart 2.101), the use of cost/technical or cost/past perfor-
            mance tradeoff procedures, integrated assessment, and other techniques commonly referred to
            “best value” approaches shall not be permitted. Sealed Bidding and “Low Price/Technically
            Acceptable Negotiated” methods are permitted.
            7.1.2.4.2. IAW 10 U.S.C. 2461 the AT cannot be eliminated from the competitive range.
            7.1.2.4.3. Mission Essential Services. The PWS will identify military mission-essential work-
            load or positions in the activity being competed. Section L of the solicitation will require off-
            erors to provide a contingency plan for those tasks identified in the PWS, information
            identifying employees that have military mobilization recall commitments, and the offerors
            plan for replacing the employees in the event of mobilization. Section M of the solicitation
            will identify how the contingency plans are to be evaluated.
            7.1.2.4.4. Section 2461(a)(1)(G) of Title 10, U.S.C., requires the public-private competition
            must examine the effect of performance of the function by a contractor on the military mission
            associated with performance of the function. In other words, the Performance Decision cannot
            be based solely on an examination of the function that is the subject of the public-private com-
            petition. The Performance Decision must take into account the military mission of functions
            and activities that rely on or are associated with the function that is being considered for con-
            tract performance. At a minimum, Section L of the solicitation will identify military missions
            (as listed in P3) that are dependent upon or are associated with the PWS and shall request off-
            erors to identify their approach for minimizing or eliminating impact (risk) to the associated
            missions if the function in the PWS is converted to contract performance. Offeror solutions
            may result in amendment of the solicitation and PWS, either with respect to mission-essential
            services in the function being competed or with respect to missions that rely on or are associ-
            ated with the function being competed. The source selection criteria in Section M of the solic-
            itation will include “Mission risk” or "Impact on missions associated with the PWS" as a
            separate "Go/No-Go" criterion to be determined before running COMPARE. The Basis for
            Award will reserve to the Government the right not to award a contract if an unacceptable mis-
            sion risk in an individual offeror’s technical or management approach cannot be eliminated or
            satisfactorily managed.
     7.1.3. Solicitation Provisions Unique to the AT. A solicitation will state the AT is not required to
     include:
        7.1.3.1. A labor strike plan;
        7.1.3.2. Socioeconomic programs;
        7.1.3.3. A subcontracting plan goal;
        7.1.3.4. Licensing or other certifications; and
        7.1.3.5. Past performance information (unless the AT is based on an MEO implemented IAW this
        or a previous AFI 38-203).
        7.1.3.6. Schedule B (unless required by the solicitation).
     7.1.4. North American Industrial Code System (NAICS). When selecting the NAICS code for the
     solicitation the Contracting Officer should review Table 14 of COMPARE to ensure the code selected
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                   87


  for the solicitation is included in the Table. See subparagraph 7.1.4.2. and 7.1.4.3. when the NAICS
  code selected for the solicitation differs from the codes contained in Table 14 of COMPARE. The
  NAICS codes in Table 14 are the only codes allowed to be used in OMB Circular A-76 public-private
  competitions.
     7.1.4.1. The North American Industrial Code System (NAICS) is used by the Small Business
     Administration (SBA) to establish size thresholds on an industry-by-industry basis based on the
     principal nature of the services or products covered. This size standard is normally applied at the
     sixth code level. FAR, Subpart 19.102(b)(3) requires the CO to use the NAICS to specify the size
     standard in a solicitation so offerors can appropriately represent themselves as small or large.
     FAR, Subpart 19.102(c) and (d) instruct the CO to classify the service in only one industry which
     represents the principal nature of the services and if the services can be classified in two industries
     to select the industry accounting for the greatest percentage of the contract price.
     7.1.4.2. When Table 14 does not have an industry code that exactly matches the NAICS code in
     the solicitation, select the code from Table 14 closest in hierarchal numbering. For example, if the
     solicitation listed 541511, Customer Computer Programming Services, select 541515, Computer
     Systems Design and Related Services. Even though the Table 14 includes the code 511210 and
     the title, Software Publishers, sounds similar to the 541511 code it would be incorrect to select it.
     Stay within the same hierarchal numbering system and do not choose an industry code solely to
     put the MEO in the best position or use a specific company responding to the solicitation to deter-
     mine the appropriate tax code.
     7.1.4.3. The selection from Table 14 should be based solely on the NAICS listed in the solicitation
     because it is that code that has been vetted during the solicitation process. Section L or M of the
     solicitation should state which Table 14 code will be used for the performance decision when there
     is not an exact match to the NAICS in the solicitation.
     7.1.4.4. Additional tax rates and NAICS industry codes may not be added to Table 14. If there is
     not an appropriate NAICS industry code for a specific activity in Table 14, one option would be to
     use 999999 - Not Allocable (Miscellaneous Companies - Not Elsewhere Classified). In this case,
     CO should issue an amendment to the solicitation that informs offers that 9999999 will be used for
     the SCF Line 12 to calculate the performance decision.
     7.1.4.5. Apply applicable tax rate to MEO Sub-contracts. MEO sub-contracts are adjusted down-
     ward to accommodate the applicable tax rate IAW the DoD Competitive Sourcing Program Base-
     line Costing For Public-Private Competitions policy, OMB Circular A-76 and the DoD A-76
     Costing Manual, paragraph C3.9. Unless the DoD Competitive Sourcing Program Baseline Cost-
     ing For Public-Private Competitions policy specifically states otherwise in paragraph 5.2. – Calcu-
     lating Baseline Costs, computations will be IAW the OMB Circular A-76 and the DoD A-76
     Costing Manual.
     7.1.4.6. COMPARE correctly computes the MEO sub-contract cost. The MEO sub-contract price
     is reduced by the applicable computed tax rate value associated with the industry code you
     selected for the subcontract. The tax rate is applied based on the same rationale as in a competi-
     tion file. The DoD Competitive Sourcing Program Baseline Costing For Public-Private Competi-
     tions policy directs calculating Preliminary Planning Baseline Costs IAW the OMB Circular A-76.
     (DoD Competitive Sourcing Program Baseline Costing For Public-Private Competitions, para-
     graph 4.2.)

     7.1.5. Solicitation Closing Date. The date for delivery of offers and tenders will be the same.
     7.1.6. Compliance Matrix. To decrease the complexity of performing source selections, the Contract-
     ing Officer will include a cross-reference compliance matrix in Section L of the solicitation (see Fig-
     ure 7.1.). A Compliance Matrix should clearly identify proposal reference information as it relates to
     the PWS, contract line item number (CLIN), solicitation Sections L and M, proposal volume and sec-
     tion, and, if appropriate, contract data requirements list (CDRL) references. This matrix should be
     modified to account for proposed performance standards that differ from the requirements in a solici-
     tation.

     7.1.7. Performance Periods. A minimum of 5 full years of performance, excluding the phase-in
     period, will be used in a standard competition IAW the DoD Costing Manual and more current DoD
     and AF guidance. Performance periods will not be used for the AT that differs from performance peri-
     ods for private sector offers and public reimbursable tenders. Supporting rationale is required for per-
     formance periods that exceed five years (excluding the phase-in period).
     7.1.8. Government Furnished Property (GFP). The PWS Team, in consultation with the Contracting
     Officer and Financial Management Flight, will be responsible for determining whether government
     property should be made available to all prospective providers. Consistent with FAR, Subparts
     45.102 and 45.3, solicitations may offer the use of existing government facilities and equipment and
     may make such use mandatory. If GFP includes vehicles, consult with Logistics Readiness Squadron
     and applicable guidance.
     7.1.9. Common Costs. The Contracting Officer will identify common costs (sometimes referred to as
     wash cost) in the solicitation. Examples of common costs include GFP, facilities construction or alter-
     ation (requiring military construction funds), background checks/security clearances, and joint inven-
     tories and will be provided by the PWS Team.
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                  89


   7.1.10. Performance Bond. If a private sector source is required to include a performance bond, the
   Contracting Officer will obtain prior written approval from the Command/CV (or equivalent and
   AFPEO/CM for public-private competitions greater than 300 FTEs). The Contracting Officer will
   include in the solicitation a separate CLIN for the cost of the performance bond. The Contracting
   Officer will include the cost of the performance bond in the contract price when entering the contract
   price on SCF Line 7.
   7.1.11. Incentive-Fee Contracts. Incentive fees are not appropriate in a public-private competition for
   a commercial activity, which should be set up on a firm fixed price basis. Firm fixed price contracts
   place the greatest incentive on contractor performance, particularly for commercial activities sup-
   ported by historical data. Additionally, because there is no legal method to provide an incentive fee to
   a MEO, the level playing field required in a public-private competition requires that neither party be
   given an incentive fee during the A-76 process. Incentive fees may be appropriate for follow-on con-
   tracts.
   7.1.12. Award Fee. Award fee arrangements shall not be used in public-private competition for com-
   mercial activities, which should be set up as firm fixed price contracts. OMBC A-76 Atch B and C
   prohibit the use of an award fee unless the MEO can also be given an award fee. There is no lawful
   authority to arrange an award fee for an in-house organization. Until provisions are in-place to ensure
   both the public and private offerors can be treated equally, award fee arrangements will not be used in
   public-private competition for commercial activities.
   7.1.13. Phase-In Plan. The Contracting Officer will include in the solicitation a separate CLIN for a
   Phase-in Plan. Private sector, public reimbursable or AT offers will propose a Phase-In Plan to replace
   the incumbent service provider. The Contracting Officer will designate the phase-in period as the first
   performance period. The CLIN is limited to phase-in costs associated with phase-in actions as docu-
   mented in the Phase-in Plan. Phase-in Plans will include details to minimize disruption and start-up
   requirements. The Phase-in Plan will consider recruiting, hiring, training, security limitations, and
   any other special considerations of the prospective providers to reflect a phase-in period of realistic
   length and requirements.
   7.1.14. Quality Control Plan (QCP). The Contracting Officer will include, in the solicitation, a
   requirement for prospective providers to include a QCP in offers and tenders.

7.2. Special Considerations.
   7.2.1. Solicitations may be set aside to support small business (SB) programs, nonprofit agencies
   under AbilityOne, and other socioeconomic programs (i.e., 8(a) NAO).
       7.2.1.1. The Javits-Wagner-O’Day (JWOD) Act (41 U.S.C. 46-48c) requires the Government to
       purchase supplies or services on the Procurement List at prices established by the Committee for
       Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled from AbilityOne nonprofit agencies,
       see paragraph 3.3.2.2. The Contracting Officer will contract with AbilityOne IAW FAR, Subpart
       8.7. Regardless of the number of DoD civilian employees, the streamlined public-private compe-
       tition process shall be used when the function (a) is included on the Procurement List established
       pursuant to the JWOD Act; or (b) is planned to be changed to performance by a qualified Ability-
       One nonprofit agency in accordance with that Act. An AbilityOne agency may elect to participate
       against offerors in a public-private standard competition; however, the conversion differential is
       applicable to their offer in these circumstances.
90                                                                               AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


        7.2.1.2. Pursuant to the criteria and procedures described in FAR, Part 19, solicitations may be set
        aside for small business, small disadvantaged business, or participants in the Section 8(a) and
        HUBZone programs of the Small Business Act. A conversion from agency to a Small Business,
        Small Disadvantaged Business, Small Business Section 8(a), or HUBZone Set Aside must be cost
        effective and the contract offer must not exceed the projected available funding. This applies to
        both streamlined and standard competitions.
        7.2.1.3. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2492 (as explained in policy memorandum from AF/A1S “SUB-
        JECT: Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAF) Memorandums of Agreement (MOA)” dated
        May 7, 2007), the NAFI MOA is an alternative to the OMB Circular A-76 procedures for compet-
        itively sourcing activities.
            7.2.1.3.1. Prior to converting to a NAFI MOA, a business case analysis is required to deter-
            mine if the conversion satisfies the following four criteria: 1) it makes good business sense,
            2) the conversion benefits both the NAFI and the APF; 3) the goods or services are those
            NAFI is authorized to provide or that are inherent to its internal operations, and 4) there is no
            additional net cost or degradation of service to the troops. The Air Force Services Agency
            (AFSVA) implementing guidance and instructions are used for all NAFI MOAs.
            7.2.1.3.2. When the NAFI MOA is used, CMEs will be placed on the UMD to reflect the num-
            ber of funded APF civilian and military authorizations in the activity prior to conversion and
            "NAFI MOA" will be placed in the Command Remarks column of the UMD.
     7.2.2. Consolidation and Bundling of Activities. The decision to consolidate or bundle activities is
     part of the acquisition strategy. The decision to consolidate is made IAW DFARS, 207.170. The deci-
     sion to bundle is made IAW FAR, Subpart 7.107. Even though a bundled or consolidated solicitation
     package includes totally independent functions which are clearly divisible, severable, and not price
     interrelated, they shall not be solicited on the basis of an "any or all" offer. Commercial offerors shall
     not be permitted to submit offers on one or any combination of the functions being solicited.
     7.2.3. Solicitations Involving APF and NAF Activities. When a combination of APF and Category A
     or B NAF work is included in a solicitation, both APF and NAF monies may be used to pay for the
     cost of a contract resulting from the public-private competition. Therefore, the PWS will clearly sep-
     arate and identify the work associated with each type of fund, and Schedule B will contain separate
     CLINs for the distinct types of funds. The solicitation will direct prospective offerors to provide sep-
     arate line item proposals/bids on each type of work (i.e., APF and NAF). Public-private competition
     under this instruction is not applicable to Category C NAF activities per paragraph 1.3.4. Only autho-
     rized individuals can obligate/expend NAFs. Ensure the proper procedures for obligation of these
     types of funds have been followed.
     7.2.4. Public Reimbursable Tenders.
        7.2.4.1. Non-DoD Federal agencies, e.g., Veterans Administration, Federal Aviation Administra-
        tion, General Services Administration, Department of Transportation, Department of Energy, etc.,
        may respond to an AF solicitation as public reimbursable tenders.
        7.2.4.2. Non-DoD Federal agencies may respond as a public reimbursable tender under appropri-
        ate statutes, e.g., the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (Title 40), the
        Space Act, Title 10, U.S.C., and the Economy Act of 1932 (31 U.S.C. 1535).
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                    91


   7.2.5. Section 2461 of Title 10, U.S.C. addresses employer-sponsored health plans and workers retire-
   ment benefits.
       7.2.5.1. This statute prohibits conversion to private sector contractor performance if the private
       sector contractor receives an advantage for a proposal that would reduce costs for DoD either;
           7.2.5.1.1. By not making an employer-sponsored health insurance plan available to the work-
           ers who are to be employed in the performance of the activity, or
           7.2.5.1.2. By offering to such workers an employer-sponsored health benefits plan that
           requires the employer to contribute less towards the premium or subscription share than the
           amount paid by the DoD for health benefits for civilian employees under “Chapter 89 of 5
           U.S.C.”
           7.2.5.1.3. By offering to such workers an employer-sponsored retirement benefits that
           requires the employer to contribute less towards the premium or subscription share than the
           amount paid by the DoD for health benefits for civilian employees under “Chapter 84 of 5
           U.S.C.”
       7.2.5.2. All offerors’ cost proposals are subject to adjustment during source selection to reflect the
       health and retirement benefits required by 10 U.S.C. 2461. OMB has established standardized
       percentages representing the amount DOD contributes to health plan and retirement benefits for
       civilian employees as a percentage of employee basic pay. Therefore, based on the data received
       from the private sector in response to Section L of the solicitation, an additional adjustment of up
       to the amount of the OMB standardized percentages will be made to the total evaluated costs for
       those offerors whose contributions do not meet the OMB standardized percentages. The Contract-
       ing Officer will check the COMPARE website to ensure the current health care and retirement fac-
       tors are inserted in Section M.
   7.2.6. Refer any questions regarding the solicitation to the Contracting Officer.

7.3. No Satisfactory Private Sector or Public Reimbursable Source. In a standard competition if no
private sector offer or public reimbursable tender is received, or if the SSA/Contracting Officer deter-
mines all offers and public reimbursable tenders are either unacceptable for award or nonresponsive, or if
the SSA/Contracting Officer determines that prospective providers are not responsible, then the appropri-
ate official will take the following actions:
   7.3.1. Determine Reasons. The Contracting Officer will consult with private sector sources to identify
   restrictive, vague, confusing, or misleading portions of the solicitation and possible revisions to the
   solicitation to enhance public-private competition.
   7.3.2. Course of Action. The Contracting Officer will describe, in writing, the content of these con-
   sultations and propose a course of action to the SSA who will provide a final recommendation to the
   CCSO.
   7.3.3. Required Action. The CCSO will evaluate the Contracting Officer’s written documentation and
   recommend a course of action to the DoD CSO to either (a) revise the solicitation or (b) implement the
   AT. If revising a solicitation would result in exceeding the established time limit for the standard com-
   petition, the DoD CSO (without delegation) will consult with the Deputy Director for Management,
   OMB. The Contracting Officer’s written documentation, as well as the DoD CSO’s decision to either
92                                                                            AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


     revise the solicitation or implement the AT, will be retained as part of the public-private competition
     file.
        7.3.3.1. Revise the Solicitation. If the DoD CSO decides to revise the solicitation, the Contracting
        Officer will return the sealed AT to the ATO before revising or reissuing the solicitation.
        7.3.3.2. Implement the AT. If the DoD CSO decides to implement the AT, the Contracting Officer
        will proceed to evaluate the AT as required by this instruction and the solicitation. Complete the
        SCF, leaving Line 7 blank; omit the costs on Lines 8-12; and annotate “agency” on Line 18. The
        SSA will state in the certification on the SCF that the DoD CSO implemented the AT because:
            7.3.3.2.1. No offers or public reimbursable tenders were received in response to the solicita-
            tion.
            7.3.3.2.2. No offers or public reimbursable tenders received were acceptable for award or
            responsive.
        7.3.3.3. The SSA/Contracting Officer will sign the SCF to certify the performance decision and
        retain the SCF and AT with the public-private competition file. A public announcement of the
        performance decision is made at the local level and via FedBizOpps.gov. The SSA/Contracting
        Officer will notify the ATO of the performance decision; the HRA will notify directly affected
        employees (and their representatives) and the MPF will notify directly affected military personnel.

        7.3.3.4. The Contracting Officer will make the SCF (including the documentation of no satisfac-
        tory private sector source) available to the public, upon request.

7.4. Roles and Responsibilities.
     7.4.1. Command/CV (designated representative or the AFPEO/CM for pubic-private competi-
     tions greater than 300 FTEs) will:
        7.4.1.1. Approve/disapprove the use of performance bonds in solicitations issued for standard
        competitions.
        7.4.1.2. Approve/disapprove, in consultation with the SSA, a solicitation amendment to change
        the solicitation closing date to accommodate the submission of the AT (nondelegable).
     7.4.2. Command Manpower and Organization (or equivalent) will consult with Command/FM for
     assistance pricing available funds to pay for the public-private competition decision. This budget
     amount will not be used as the ceiling in the solicitation.
     7.4.3. Servicing Contracting Officer will:
        7.4.3.1. Comply with the FAR and this instruction.
        7.4.3.2. Ensure the servicing Manpower and Organization activity is provided copies of the solic-
        itation and all amendments to the solicitation.
        7.4.3.3. Post a draft of the PWS or solicitation, amendments, etc. via FedBizOpps. Once posted,
        these documents are available for public review and comment, including review and comment by
        directly affected government personnel and representatives of directly affected employees.
        7.4.3.4. Recommend an acquisition strategy in consultation with the acquisition strategy team and
        IAW FAR, Part 7.
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                               93


     7.4.3.5. Include a cross-reference compliance matrix in Section L of the solicitation.

                                                  Chapter 8

                                         AGENCY TENDER (AT)

8.1. Policy. This chapter provides guidance for developing the AT which is the agency management plan
submitted in response to a solicitation for a standard competition. This chapter also applies to developing
a public reimbursable tender.

8.2. Special Considerations:
     8.2.1. Any information associated with the AT is considered source selection sensitive and will be
     marked IAW FAR, Subpart 3.104-4.
     8.2.2. After public announcement, the MEO Team may begin AT development without completion of
     a PWS. However, the MEO Team will respond to the PWS performance standards, technical exhibits,
     and other requirements included in the solicitation.
        8.2.2.1. Base the AT on the PWS requirements and PWS workload estimates, not on current
        workload, staffing, performance standards or work methods. There is no requirement to apply
        existing manpower standards or standard manpower calculation methodologies.
        8.2.2.2. The AT may propose alternate performance standards, if the solicitation states prospec-
        tive providers may propose alternate performance standards that differ from the solicitation’s
        PWS performance standards.
     8.2.3. During development of the AT, the MEO Team must begin establishing a cost accounting struc-
     ture (Responsibility Center/Cost Centers (RCCCs) and Element of Expense Investment Codes
     (EEICs)). A detailed Execution Plan (ExPlan), by work center, for every performance period will be
     required for Post Competition Accountability.
     8.2.4. Documents submitted in response to a standard competition will be retained in the government
     public-private competition files IAW FAR, Subpart 4.8.
     8.2.5. Waiver requests to AF instructions, policy directives, etc., are submitted, in writing, through the
     command-level FAM to the AF FAM. MEOs have an automatic blanket waiver to deviate from stan-
     dard organizational structures specified in AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization. Waiver requests can
     also be facilitated through SAF/AQC when assistance is needed with prescriptive AFIs.
     8.2.6. Labor organizations or appointed representatives (directly affected employees not represented
     by labor unions, may appoint a representative(s)) may participate in the development and preparation
     of the AT on behalf of directly affected civilian employees. Representatives can only provide advisory
     support to team members who actually develop the AT; however, firewall requirements must be
     adhered to.
     8.2.7. At least monthly, management (i.e., the ATO, acting on behalf of the Government) solicits the
     views of directly affected government personnel and representatives of directly affected employees
     for input to the AT (10 U.S.C. 2461). Union representatives may participate in meetings in an advi-
     sory capacity except where management decisions are made or source selection information is dis-
     cussed.
     8.2.8. Private sector contractor assistance in developing the AT is permitted as long as the private sec-
     tor contractor will not submit an offer for the workload. The conflict of interest involved in submit-
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                      95


   ting an offer on the same solicitation after helping write a competing offer raises questions of impaired
   objectivity that cannot be mitigated. This is unlike the conflict of interest associated with access to
   source selection information, proprietary information and trade secrets, which can be mitigated
   through a nondisclosure agreement. Even with nondisclosure agreements, any contractor whose
   employees participate in PWS development may not participate on the MEO team for the same A-76
   initiative.
   8.2.9. Productivity Enhancing Capital Investment (PECI) or Innovative Development through
   Employee Awareness (IDEA) Programs may only be used to fund capital investments or submit
   IDEAs prior to A-76 initiative announcement or after an A-76 initiative is complete (i.e., the final
   decision is implemented). Personnel involved with developing the PWS or AT are ineligible partici-
   pants in the IDEA program since PWS and AT development are the result of a downward-directed
   analysis, thereby violating established program eligibility criteria (AFI 38-401, The AF Innovative
   Development Through Employee Awareness (IDEA) Program.
   8.2.10. Protection of Source Selection and Proprietary Information. After resolution of a contest/pro-
   test or the expiration of the time for filing a contest/protest, an AT will be made available to the public,
   upon request (see paragraph 9.6.). If an AT includes any contracts, proprietary information contained
   in these contracts will not be released, unless authorized by the owner of the proprietary information.
   8.2.11. Consult monthly with directly affected government personnel (and representatives) and con-
   sider their views during the development and preparation of the AT (10 U.S.C. 2461). Document how
   consultations are accomplished and retain as part of the public-private competition documentation.
   For directly affected civilian employees:
       8.2.11.1. Represented by a union, consultation with union representatives fulfills this require-
       ment. Alternatively, this requirement can be met by including union representatives on the MEO
       Team.
       8.2.11.2. Not represented by a union, consultation may be accomplished through group meetings
       or by a representative(s) designated by the affected employees. Alternatively, this requirement
       can be met by including employees/representatives on the MEO Team.

8.3. The Agency Tender (developed by the MEO Team (see paragraph 5.5.2.1.1.)) will include:
   8.3.1. A Most Efficient Organization (MEO). The MEO is a written Government plan, as identified
   in the AT, for staffing an organization and identifying the resources needed to accomplish the require-
   ments issued in the solicitation. The MEO (plan) is not usually a representation of the incumbent
   organization, but is the product of management analyses that may include but is not limited to activity
   based costing, business case analysis, consolidation, functionality assessment, industrial engineering,
   market research, productivity assessment, reengineering, reinvention, utilization studies, and value
   engineering. The MEO does not consist of the directly affected employees, who have no personal
   interest in or control over agency decisions.
       8.3.1.1. In developing the MEO, the MEO Team will explore and exploit new, innovative, and
       creative ways for the Government to provide the required services in a cost-effective manner. If
       doing so requires resources not normally available to the CC/CV (e.g., military construction fund-
       ing), the ATO will consider whether to request a change to the solicitation that will enable all off-
       erors to provide proposals on the same technical approach or whether to merely submit a budget
       request through the CC/CV.
96                                                                           AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


        8.3.1.2. The AT will include an organization chart showing the MEO that will perform the
        requirements of the PWS. The AT will also describe the organization that will execute the QCP.
        The AT shall identify the inherently governmental person who will be responsible for the MEO
        (and, thus, the Letter of Obligation) if the MEO is selected to perform the activity through pub-
        lic-private competition.
        8.3.1.3. The HRA will develop and classify new position descriptions (PDs) projected to be in the
        MEO. Individuals will not be hired to staff these positions unless the MEO is the selected pro-
        vider.
        8.3.1.4. An MEO may be comprised of either government positions or a mix of government posi-
        tions and existing MEO contracts (labor contracts between the government and private sector that
        complete work requirements defined by the PWS and solicitation). Include copies of existing
        MEO contracts, for contracted workload, if they will be continued in the AT solution. However,
        agencies will not include new contracts that would result in the direct conversion of work per-
        formed by 10 or more DoD civilian employee authorizations.
        8.3.1.5. An MEO will account for indirect time associated with the MEO IAW the DoD Costing
        Manual and more current OMB, DoD, and AF guidance. Recommend using the Standard Indirect
        Allowed Man-hours (SIAM) in AFMAN 38-208, AF Management Engineering Program (MEP)
        – Quantification Tools, Volume 2, Chapter 13.
        8.3.1.6. Account for MEO overhead hours IAW the DoD Costing Manual and more current OMB,
        DoD, and AF guidance.
        8.3.1.7. An MEO will not exceed an amount equivalent to the dollar value of programmed end
        strength (less appropriate programmed savings) plus other identifiable budgeted non-pay dollars
        associated with the activity undergoing public-private competition, as certified by the Financial
        Management Flight.
        8.3.1.8. Other elements of an MEO include equipment, supplies, material, and facilities.
        8.3.1.9. Final decisions regarding the AT are at the discretion of the ATO.
     8.3.2. A certified Agency Cost Estimate (ACE) developed IAW the DoD Costing Manual and more
     current OMB, DoD, and AF guidance using the COMPARE software (the agency’s cost proposal).
        8.3.2.1. Commands will not deviate from the DoD Costing Manual or more current OSD or
        higher policy/procedures without prior approval from OSD. Deviation requests will be submitted
        in writing through AF/A1M to OSD for approval.
        8.3.2.2. Document the costs for contract administration and Letter of Obligation administration
        based on Table 5.1. IAW the DoD Costing Manual and more current OMB, DoD, and AF costing
        guidance.
        8.3.2.3. The OSD Competitive Sourcing and Privatization Office has established an A-76 Costing
        Help Desk to assist with the complexities of A-76 costing and software issues. The Help Desk can
        be found on the COMPARE website.
        8.3.2.4. Background checks/security clearances are a government furnished service and consid-
        ered a common cost because there is no cost to industry or the government customer.
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                    97


   8.3.3. A QCP. The QCP is a self-inspection plan that describes the internal staffing and procedures
   used to ensure the MEO meets the requirements of the PWS. At a minimum, the QCP will include:
       8.3.3.1. An MEO self-inspection plan.
       8.3.3.2. MEO personnel, by title and/or office symbol, responsible for quality control.
       8.3.3.3. Procedures the MEO will use to meet the quality, quantity, timeliness, responsiveness,
       customer satisfaction, and other requirements of the solicitation.
   8.3.4. A Phase-in Plan. A written plan describing actions required to staff and implement the MEO.
   It is designed to minimize disruption, adverse impacts, capitalization, and start-up requirements for
   the transition.
       8.3.4.1. The ATO will include phase-in costs for the AT on SCF Lines 1-6.
       8.3.4.2. Request for extension of phase-in period, with justification, is submitted from the Com-
       mand/A1 (or equivalent) to AF/A1M for approval. Written approval is maintained with the
       Phase-in Plan.

8.4. Submission of the Agency Tender.
   8.4.1. The ATO will deliver the certified AT in a sealed package to the Contracting Officer by the pro-
   posal/bid due date and IAW all solicitation requirements.
   8.4.2. If the ATO does not anticipate submitting the AT to the Contracting Officer by the proposal/bid
   due date, the ATO will notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible before the proposal/bid due
   date. The Contracting Officer, in consultation with the Command/CV (or CCSO delegated designee),
   will determine if amending the proposal/bid due date is in the best interest of the Government.

8.5. Changes to the Agency Tender. After the proposal/bid due date, only the ATO may make changes
to the AT. The Contracting Officer will retain documentation regarding any changes to the AT as part of
the public-private competition file and in a form suitable for audit. Changes will only be in response to the
following:
   8.5.1. A solicitation amendment issued IAW the FAR;
   8.5.2. Discussions and responses to evaluation notices during the public-private competition;
   8.5.3. The Contracting Officer’s request for final proposal revisions to offers and tenders IAW FAR,
   Subpart 15.307;
   8.5.4. Official changes to the standard cost factors identified in the DoD Costing Manual and more
   current OMB, DoD, and AF guidance;
   8.5.5. Version upgrades to the COMPARE costing software issued by the DoD; or
   8.5.6. Resolution of a contest/protest challenging a performance decision as provided by this instruc-
   tion.

8.6. Public Reimbursable Tenders. When responding to another agency’s solicitation, a public reim-
bursable source will develop a public reimbursable tender that responds to the requirements of the solici-
tation, including Section L (Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors or Respondents) and Section
M (Evaluation Factors for Award).
98                                                                               AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


     8.6.1. In addition to the requirements of the solicitation, the public reimbursable tender will include
     the following:
        8.6.1.1. A certified cost estimate developed IAW the DoD Costing Manual and more current
        OMB, DoD, and AF guidance (the public reimbursable source’s cost proposal);
        8.6.1.2. A QCP;
        8.6.1.3. A Phase-in Plan, and
        8.6.1.4. Copies of any existing awarded contracts that are included in the tender (with the private
        sector provider’s proprietary information redacted).
     8.6.2. A public reimbursable tender may be comprised of either government personnel or a mix of
     government personnel and existing awarded contracts.
     8.6.3. Submission of, and changes to, a public reimbursable tender, as well as the procurement sensi-
     tivity of the public reimbursable tender, will be subject to the corresponding provisions of this instruc-
     tion applicable to the agency tender (see paragraphs 8.4. and 8.5.).

     cerns.
100                                                                             AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


      8.7.8. Agency Tender Official (ATO) will:
         8.7.8.1. Make all final management decisions regarding the AT.
         8.7.8.2. Develop, certify, and represent the AT.
         8.7.8.3. Review all solicitation amendments and updates to COMPARE tables and make changes
         to the AT, as applicable.
         8.7.8.4. Appoint an MEO Team lead, after public announcement (see paragraph 5.5.2.1.1.).
         8.7.8.5. Obtain the necessary resources and training to prepare a competitive AT. An agency will
         ensure the ATO has access to crucial required resources (e.g., skilled manpower and funding).
         8.7.8.6. Obtain approval from the wing/installation/activity CC/CV or command CV, before sub-
         mitting the AT, ensuring the resources identified in the AT will be available to the Government
         (MEO) to perform the activity in the event of an agency performance decision.
         8.7.8.7. Serve as the agency’s point of contact to respond on behalf of the Government to discus-
         sion and clarification notices presented by the Contracting Officer during a negotiated procure-
         ment.
         8.7.8.8. File contests/protests on behalf of the Government. After consulting with assigned
         agency counsel, if the ATO believes there is reason to seek review of the process, the ATO decides
         whether to file a contest (using agency level bid protest procedures) or a bid protest (with the
         GAO) on behalf of the interest of the AF to ensure a fair and accurate procurement process.
      8.7.9. MEO Team Lead will:
         8.7.9.1. Appoint an MEO Team comprised of technical and functional experts.
         8.7.9.2. Lead development of the MEO.
         8.7.9.3. Ensure individuals developing the MEO do not assist in PWS development or participate
         in source selection.
         8.7.9.4. Ensure development of position descriptions (PD), as needed, for MEO positions, to be
         classified by the HRA/servicing CPF.
         8.7.9.5. Obtain waivers to AF directives, as required, when developing the MEO.
         8.7.9.6. Maintain all supporting data used to develop the MEO.
         8.7.9.7. Develop a Phase-in Plan.
      8.7.10. Servicing Judge Advocate Office (SJA) will:
         8.7.10.1. Assist the ATO and MEO Team in ensuring compliance with labor laws.
         8.7.10.2. Assist the ATO with any negotiations (e.g., source selection and contest/protest).
         8.7.10.3. Assist the ATO in determining the legal merit of potential contest/protest issues. The
         agency may assign a different attorney to represent the ATO if a contest/protest is raised outside of
         the AF.
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                   101


                                                Chapter 9

      PERFORMANCE DECISIONS, FINAL DECISIONS, PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS,
                    DEBRIEFINGS, CONTESTS, PROTESTS

9.1. Policy. This chapter provides guidance regarding performance and final decisions, public announce-
ment actions, debriefing requirements and contest/protest processes for each potential service provider
after a streamlined or standard competition. The performance decision is not final until all periods for fil-
ing a contest/protest have expired or, if filed, until the contest/ protest is concluded. The purpose of con-
test/protest proceedings is to obtain administrative review by an impartial official.

9.2. Evaluation of Private Sector Offers, Public Reimbursable Tenders, and Agency Tenders.
   9.2.1. The SSEB will evaluate all technical offers simultaneously, to include the AT. The CO, SSA,
   and SSEB will not:
       9.2.1.1. Convey, require, make, direct, or request adjustments to a tender or offer that would iden-
       tify any proprietary or procurement sensitive information from another offer or tender; or
       9.2.1.2. Require, direct, or make specific changes to an offer or tender, including the approach and
       staffing requirements.
   9.2.2. The Contracting Officer will conduct a source selection IAW FAR 15.3. The CO, SSA and
   SSEB will restrict changes to the AT to the following:
       9.2.2.1. A solicitation amendment issued IAW the FAR;
       9.2.2.2. Discussions and responses to evaluation notices during the public-private competition;
       9.2.2.3. The CO’s request for final proposal revisions to offers and tenders IAW FAR 15.307;
       9.2.2.4. Official changes to the standard cost factors identified in the DoD Costing Manual and
       more current OMB, DoD, and AF guidance;
       9.2.2.5. Version upgrades to the COMPARE costing software issued by DoD; or
       9.2.2.6. Resolution of a contest/protest challenging a performance decision as provided by this
       instruction.
   9.2.3. If the Contracting Officer conducts exchanges with private sector offerors, public reimbursable
   sources, or the ATO, during the course of the public-private competition, those exchanges will be IAW
   FAR, Subpart 15.306, with the following exceptions:
       9.2.3.1. For an AT, the Contracting Officer will correspond with the ATO, in writing. The records
       of all such correspondence will be maintained as part of the public-private competition file.
       9.2.3.2. The Contracting Officer and ATO will include clear, sufficient, and unambiguous infor-
       mation in the correspondence to adequately convey concerns, responses, or information regarding
       the AT.
   9.2.4. Deficiencies in an Offer or Tender. If the Contracting Officer perceives a private sector offer,
   public reimbursable tender, or AT is materially deficient, the Contracting Officer will:
       9.2.4.1. Ensure the ATO, private sector offeror, or the public reimbursable tender official receives
       a deficiency notice.
102                                                                             AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


         9.2.4.2. Afford the ATO, the private sector offeror, or the public reimbursable tender official a
         specific number of days to address the material deficiency and, if necessary, to revise and recertify
         the tender or offer.
             9.2.4.2.1. If the ATO (after consulting with the commander responsible for resources for the
             activity being competed) is unable to correct a material deficiency, the Command CV (or
             equivalent) will determine if a commitment of additional resources will enable the ATO to cor-
             rect the material deficiency within the specified number of days. If the Command CV (or
             equivalent) determines that the ATO cannot correct the material deficiency with a reasonable
             commitment of additional resources, the Command CV (or equivalent) may request permis-
             sion to cancel the public-private competition.
             9.2.4.2.2. If the Contracting Officer determines that a private sector offeror or public reim-
             bursable tender official has not corrected a material deficiency, the SSA may exclude the pri-
             vate sector offer or public reimbursable tender from the public-private competition.
      9.2.5. Price Analysis and Cost Realism of Private Sector Cost Proposals, Public Reimbursable Cost
      Estimates, and ACE. Most probable cost analysis shall not be used to attempt to neutralize the value
      of innovations or initiatives in any offers or the differences in perceived value, risk or suitability
      among offers.
         9.2.5.1. General. Regardless of the contract type stated in the solicitation, the Contracting Officer
         will perform cost realism and price analysis (as defined in FAR, Parts 2 and 15) on all private sec-
         tor cost proposals, public reimbursable cost estimates (SCF Lines 1a-6a), and the ACE (SCF Lines
         1-6). Cost analysis (IAW FAR, Part 15) is not required for a standard competition but may be per-
         formed at the discretion of the SSA, consistent with OMB Circular A-76.
         9.2.5.2. Agency and Public Reimbursable Cost Estimates. The Contracting Officer will ensure
         the agency and public reimbursable cost estimates are:5
             9.2.5.2.1. Calculated IAW the DoD Costing Manual and more current OMB, DoD, and AF
             guidance;
             9.2.5.2.2. Based on the standard cost factors in effect on the performance decision date; and
             9.2.5.2.3. Developed using the version of the COMPARE costing software in effect on the
             performance decision date.
      9.2.6. Conversion Differential. All standard competitions will include the conversion differential.
      The Contracting Officer will:
         9.2.6.1. Ensure the conversion differential is calculated IAW statutes, the DoD Costing Manual
         and more current OMB, DoD, and AF guidance and reflected on SCF Line 14.
         9.2.6.2. When 10 or more DoD civilian employee authorizations are involved in performing all or
         any part of a commercial activity, 10 U.S.C. 2461(a)(1)(G) and the Defense Appropriations Act
         specify the conversion differential that shall be used. DoD applies the conversion differential as
         required by 10 U.S.C. 2461 in lieu of paragraph D in Attachment C to OMB Circular A-76 when
         the incumbent performing the commercial activity (including expansions) consists of 10 or more
         DoD civilian employee authorizations; a combination of private sector contractors and 10 or more
         DoD civilian employee authorizations; or a combination of public reimbursable sources and 10 or
         more DoD civilian employee authorizations. The conversion differential is a number that is the
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                103


      lesser of 10 percent of the AT personnel-related costs (reflected on SCF Line 1) or $10 million
      over all the performance periods stated in the solicitation. The conversion differential is added to
      the cost estimate of performance by a private sector or public reimbursable source.
      9.2.6.3. If the incumbent provider is solely a private sector and/or public reimbursable source, the
      conversion differential is a number that is the lesser of 10 percent of the AT personnel-related
      costs or $10 million over all the performance periods, and is added to the cost estimate of agency
      performance.
      9.2.6.4. The conversion differential precludes conversions based on marginal estimated savings
      and captures nonquantifiable costs related to a conversion, such as disruption and decreased pro-
      ductivity.
   9.2.7. SLCF/SCF Overview. As part of the requirement to conduct price analysis and cost realism the
   Contracting Officer will ensure the SLCF/SCF are prepared IAW the DoD Costing Manual, OMBC
   A-76, Attachment C, and more current DoD guidance and the required signatures and certifications
   are on the SLCF/SCF.
      9.2.7.1. For streamlined competition the Contracting Officer certifies:
          9.2.7.1.1. The cost estimate on SLCF Line 7 is based on documented market research or solic-
          ited cost proposals IAW the FAR.
          9.2.7.1.2. A public reimbursable source estimate as reflected on SLCF Line 7 and the scope
          and requirements of the activity being competed.
      9.2.7.2. For a standard competition the Contracting Officer certifies:
          9.2.7.2.1. The Agency Tender meets the requirements of the solicitation and the agency cost
          estimate reflected on SCF Lines 1-6 is accurate;
          9.2.7.2.2. The private sector offer meets the requirement of the solicitation, the offeror is
          responsible, and the contract price is reasonable (only if a contract price is entered on COM-
          PARE Line 7);
          9.2.7.2.3. The public reimbursable cost estimate meets the requirements of the solicitation.
          Only when a public reimbursable cost estimate is entered on SCF Line 7 that the public reim-
          bursable tender meets the requirements of the solicitation and the cost estimate reflected on
          SCF Lines 1a-6a is accurate;
          9.2.7.2.4. The costs on SCF Lines 8-18 are accurate;
          9.2.7.2.5. The performance decision is a low-cost decision supported by SCF Line 17.

9.3. Performance Decision.
   9.3.1. Streamlined Competition Performance Decision. Actions required upon performance deci-
   sion for a streamlined competition will be carried out IAW paragraph 9.3.1.2. for an agency perfor-
   mance decision and IAW paragraph 9.3.1.3. for a private sector performance decision.
      9.3.1.1. Streamlined Competitions Certifications: All three certifications on the SLCF will be
      made by different individuals.
104                                                                        AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


         9.3.1.1.1. The preparer of the ACE (may not be the Baseline Costing Official who developed
         the preliminary planning baseline cost, generally someone from the Manpower and Organiza-
         tion activity).
         9.3.1.1.2. The preparer of the private sector cost estimate (a Contracting Officer).
         9.3.1.1.3. The performance decision certifying official (a government official, independent of
         the Contracting Officer and preparer of the ACE).
      9.3.1.2. Agency (In-House) Performance Decision: If the performance decision (SLCF Line
      18) indicates agency (MEO) performance, implement IAW paragraph 10.2. A solicitation will not
      be issued and the public-private competition clock stops. The agency provider is considered an
      MEO at performance decision and is coded and treated as an MEO. During PCA, all applicable
      MEO costs (Lines 1, 2, and 3—limited to existing MEO subcontracts) will need to be accounted
      for using the A-76 Cost Tracking Tool (ACTT).
         9.3.1.2.1. Make a formal public announcement (paragraph 9.4.) of the final decision at the
         local level and via FedBizOpps.gov (Figure 9.3.) prior to submission of the HAF-A1M (AR)
         8001.
         9.3.1.2.2. Certify and submit the SLCF and the RCS: HAF-A1M (AR) 8001 (Figure 9.8.) to
         AF/A1MS, via e-mail, with a courtesy copy to AFMA/MAC, no later than 7 calendar days
         after performance decision. The performance decision is the final decision.
         9.3.1.2.3. Make the SLCF available to the public, upon request. If the ACE includes any
         existing MEO subcontracts, proprietary information in these contracts will not be released.
         9.3.1.2.4. The Agency Cost Estimate (ACE) will be used as the foundation for the ACTT.
         9.3.1.2.5. Ensure the SLCF Line 3 excludes everything (i.e., annual TDYs, vehicular cost, and
         GSA costs) except Line 3e (existing MEO subcontracts, if applicable). The costs in Lines 3a,
         3b, 3c, 3d, 3f, and 3g are not included in ACTT for post competition accountability purposes
         since they were not part of the competitive process upon which the performance decision was
         made.
      9.3.1.3. Private Sector Performance Decision: If the performance decision indicates private
      sector performance as less costly than agency performance (SLCF Line 18), certify the SLCF, and
      the public-private competition clock stops.
         9.3.1.3.1. Make a formal public announcement (paragraph 9.4.) of the performance decision
         at the local level and via FedBizOpps.gov (Figure 9.4.). Notify AF/A1MS of the perfor-
         mance decision via e-mail, with a courtesy copy to AFMA/MAC.
         9.3.1.3.2. Do not divulge the costs entered on SLCF Lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 to the Contract-
         ing Officer or any prospective service provider until a final decision.
         9.3.1.3.3. Verify private sector performance is cost effective prior to conversion. This is
         proven via typical acquisition procedures (issuing a solicitation using the PWS developed dur-
         ing the competition and conducting source selection to select the low-cost private sector off-
         eror). The solicitation must state conversion to private sector performance is contingent upon
         verification that conversion is less costly to the Government than retaining the activity
         in-house as outlined in the SLCF.
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                105


            9.3.1.3.3.1. No adjustments to the SLCF Lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will be made except as
            required by the solicitation or official cost factor changes. Any such changes will be justi-
            fied by solicitation amendments; auditable to the original SLCF costs, documented in writ-
            ing, and will become part of the public private competition file. This becomes the revised
            SLCF (separate from the original SLCF). If no changes are required, the revised SLCF
            will be a duplicate of the original.
            9.3.1.3.3.2. Calculate a revised SLCF where only Line 7 is revised to identify the lowest
            cost private sector cost proposal to make a final decision.
        9.3.1.3.4. Final decision public announcement.
            9.3.1.3.4.1. Make a formal public announcement (paragraph 9.4.) of the final decision at
            the local level and via FedBizOpps.gov. (Figure 9.5.) prior to release of the HAF-A1M
            (AR) 8001.
            9.3.1.3.4.2. Make the SLCF available to the public, upon request. If the ACE includes any
            existing MEO subcontracts, proprietary information in these contracts will not be released.
        9.3.1.3.5. Certify and submit the SLCF and the RCS: HAF-A1M (AR) 8001 to AF/A1MS, via
        e-mail, with a courtesy copy to AFMA/MAC, no later than 7 calendar days after final decision.

     9.3.1.4. When no private sector or public reimbursable source responds to a solicitation, the DoD
     CSO will make a written determination to revise and reissue the solicitation or implement the AT.
     If the DoD CSO approves implementation of the agency tender, the final decision will be agency
     performance.
     9.3.1.5. The initial SLCF (including all documentation) indicating a performance decision and the
     revised SLCF (including all documentation) indicating a final decision will be retained in the pub-
     lic-private competition file.
     9.3.1.6. Ensure DCAMIS is updated and validated with the appropriate result and information up
     to and including the final decision. If private sector contractor performance decision, reflect pri-
     vate sector contractor costs based on the actual solicitation results rather than private-sector con-
     tractor cost estimate developed from market research.
  9.3.2. Standard Competition Performance Decision.
     9.3.2.1. Standard competition performance decision recommendation will be made by the SSA
     after all negotiations are completed. Only acceptable offers will be included in the final cost com-
     petition against the cost of the Agency Tender.
     9.3.2.2. The SSA/Contracting Officer will sign the SCF to certify a performance decision. The
     date all SCF certifications (ATO/Contracting Officer/SSA) are complete, signifying a perfor-
     mance decision, is the end date.
     9.3.2.3. No changes (including corrections) will be made to the SCF, AT, or public reimbursable
     tender after the proposal/bid due date except in response to a contest/protest under paragraph 9.7.
     9.3.2.4. Make public announcement (paragraph 9.4.) of the performance decision at the local level
     and via FedBizOpps.gov. (Figure 9.6.). Make public announcement and notification of the final
106                                                                             AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


         decision (Figure 9.7.) after any contests/protests are resolved. Notify AF/A1MS of the perfor-
         mance decision and later the final decision via e-mail, with a courtesy copy to AFMA/MAC.
             9.3.2.4.1. In the announcement for a negotiated acquisition, include the information regarding
             offers and tenders identified in FAR, Subpart 15.503(b). If the AT includes any existing MEO
             contracts, do not release proprietary information contained in these subcontracts.
             9.3.2.4.2. In the announcement for a sealed bid acquisition include the information made pub-
             lic at bid opening, under FAR, Subpart 14.4.

9.4. Public Announcement:
      9.4.1. Performance Decision: The Command/A1M (or equivalent) will notify AF/A1MS, via e-mail,
      after a performance decision is made (once SLCF/SCF is certified). Regardless of the performance
      decision outcome or public-private competition size, ensure directly affected government personnel
      (and representatives) are notified as soon as possible, but no later than two business days after deci-
      sion. Once directly affected government personnel are notified, post to FedBizOpps.gov.
         9.4.1.1. When 10 or more DoD civilian employee authorizations are employed with the activity at
         the time of decision, a courtesy informal congressional notification is required regardless of
         whether the outcome is a decision in favor of private sector contractor performance or Govern-
         ment performance. This notification should occur nearly simultaneous to employee notification.
         SAF/LLP, working in conjunction with AF/A1MS and the command, will initiate a courtesy con-
         gressional notification.
         9.4.1.2. If a press release or other form of publicity is desired, it must be made after the directly
         affected government personnel and representatives of directly affected employees are notified.
         This applies to all initiatives, regardless of whether congressional notification is required.
      9.4.2. Final Decision: The final decision is made following the performance decision after any con-
      tests/protests are resolved. SAF/LLP in conjunction with AF/A1MS must formally notify Congress
      (Figure 9.1.) prior to implementation of a final decision when 10 or more DoD civilian employee
      authorizations were performing the activity when the public private competition was commenced.
      This requirement is necessary to comply with 10 U.S.C. 2462 and applies to both award of a contract
      or Letter of Obligation. As determined by the command, formal public announcement (Figure 9.2.)
      may be made at the command level, wing/installation/activity level, or concurrently at both levels.
      The Contracting Officer will post public announcement to FedBizOpps after the directly affected gov-
      ernment personnel (and representatives) are notified. No performance decision can be implemented
      until the economic analysis (if required) is completed IAW AFMAN 65-506 and sent to the servicing

9.6. Release of the Certified SCF and Tenders. The certified SCF, AT, and public reimbursable tenders
will be released only as provided in this paragraph.
   9.6.1. Until resolution of any contest/protest (paragraph 9.7.) or expiration of the time for filing a con-
   test/protest, only “legal agents” (attorneys or persons working directly for and under the supervision
   of attorneys) for directly interested parties will have access to the certified SCF, AT, and public reim-
   bursable tenders.
   9.6.2. As a condition of access, a legal agent of a directly interested party will be required to sign a
   nondisclosure agreement, similar to a GAO protective order. The agreement will provide that a signa-
   tory may share the information covered by the agreement only with other signatories, and only for
   purposes of challenging the performance decision.
   9.6.3. Upon resolution of a contest or protest challenging a performance decision (e.g., when a written
   decision is rendered, or expiration of the time for filing such a contest/protest expires), the certified
   SCF and agency/public reimbursable tenders will be available to the public, upon request. Govern-
   ment tenders will not be released if they are to be used in another public-private competition at the
   same or another location such that release would create an unfair competitive advantage for potential
   offerors.
   9.6.4. Proprietary information of private sector providers of existing MEO subcontracts included in
   the agency or public reimbursable tenders will not be released.

9.7. Contest and Protest (Standard Competition Only). The pursuit of a contest by a directly inter-
ested party (contester) and the resolution of such contest will be governed by FAR, Subpart 33.103, pro-
cedures for agency-level protests. Protests to the GAO are governed by FAR, Part 33 and GAO rules.
   9.7.1. Standard Competitions. A directly interested party (see definition in Attachment 1) may con-
   test/protest any of the following actions taken in connection with a standard competition:
       9.7.1.1. A solicitation;
       9.7.1.2. The cancellation of a solicitation;
       9.7.1.3. A determination to exclude a tender or offer from a standard competition;
       9.7.1.4. A performance decision, including but not limited to, compliance with the costing provi-
       sions of this instruction and other elements in an evaluation of offers and tenders;
       9.7.1.5. A termination or cancellation of a contract or Letter of Obligation (LOO) if the challenge
       contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on impropri-
       eties concerning the performance decision.
   9.7.2. Streamlined Competitions. No party may contest/protest any aspect of a streamlined competi-
   tion. This rule does not preclude GAO or agency-level contests/protests if a solicitation was issued.

9.8. Best Practices and Lessons Learned. A-76 participants at all levels will provide the servicing
Manpower and Organization activity the best practices and lessons learned resulting from a public-private
competition for posting on the SHARE A-76! website. Before posting, the Contracting Officer will
review all information for proprietary or source selection information.

[Appropriate Congressional Member/Title/Address]

Dear [Name]

This is to inform you that the commander of (wing/installation/activity), [state], has conducted a public-private competition
to determine the most efficient and cost effective method of performance for [list CA(s)]. The public-private competition
determined performance by [a private sector contractor, the Air Force, or other agency] (when 10 or more DoD civilians are
employed with the activity at the time of the decision)] to be the most efficient and cost effective method of operation and will
result in a savings to the Government of $[dollar amount] over a [number] month period.

The public-private competition commenced on [date of public announcement, i.e., Start Date] and was conducted in
accordance with the policies and procedures of the Office of Management and Budget Circular (OMBC) A-76, Performance
of Commercial Activities. The schedule for implementing the results of this public-private competition is [fill in or attach the
schedule]

In addition to cost and quality, the public-private competition examined the potential effect of private sector contractor
performance on the military mission associated with this activity. Performance of this activity by private sector contractor
personnel [will or will not] affect the military mission at [installation name]. [Explain any mission impacts and how they
will be mitigated.]

The public-private competition was based on a planned performance period of [number] months [month/day/year--month/
day/year]. The cost of the contract is $[dollar amount]. Additional costs and expenditures the Government will incur
because of the contract will be $[dollar amount] for a total cost under contracting of $[dollar amount]. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C.
2462, the Air Force certifies that the Government agency cost estimate is based on the most efficient and cost effective manner
for performance by Defense Department civilian employee authorizations that meets the needs of the Department with respect
to factors other than cost, including quality and reliability. The cost of performance by government personnel would have
been $[dollar amount] based on a Most Efficient Organization (MEO) of [number] civilians. The Air Force certifies the
public-private competition is available for examination.

The [installation name] Human Resources Advisor (HRA)/Servicing Civilian Personnel Officer (or Human Resources
Officer (HRO for NAF)) is presently determining placement opportunities for the [number] civilian employees assigned on
the date the performance decision was determined. Separation incentives and voluntary early retirement will be offered to
avoid or minimize involuntary separations. The Air Force estimates [number] Defense civilian employees’ employment was
or will be terminated or otherwise affected by implementing this performance decision. The Air Force certifies that the
public-private competition did not include any predetermined personnel constraint or limitation in terms of man years, end
strength, full-time equivalent positions, or maximum number of employees.
OR
(The following paragraph is used in addition to the previous paragraph when the Congressional RIF notification will occur
concurrently with the 10 U.S.C. 2462 notification made by AF/A1M.)

At this time, it appears that approximately [number] permanent employees may have to be separated. The effective date of
the RIF is [month/day/year]. Affected employees will be given at least 60-days notification. The Air Force deeply regrets the
necessity of separating skilled, loyal employees, and every effort is being made to mitigate the adverse effects of this action.
Attempts are being made to locate suitable vacancies on the installation and outplacement assistance will be provided to those
separated. [number] permanent civilian employees will be offered Government positions, and [number] permanent civilian
employees will retire. [number] temporary positions will be eliminated. [include the following if more than 50 DoD
civilian employee authorizations

impacted region is expected to decrease by [X] percent. A net decrease in secondary jobs created of [X]
percent will probably occur.

PUBLIC AFFAIRS ANNOUNCEMENT


[STREAMLINED COMPETITION OR STANDARD COMPETITION] DECISION
ANNOUNCEMENT


[Insert Base Name, Activity(s)]
(EXAMPLE: BLYTHEVILLE AFB, GROUNDS MAINTENANCE)


The [wing/installation/activity] Commander, [rank and name], of [Command] has announced a
performance decision of [activity(s)]. Public-private competition between agency tender and private
sector performance determined [agency or private sector contractor] performance to be the most
efficient and cost effective method of operation. This public-private competition affects a total of
[number] DoD personnel [number] officers, [number] enlisted, [number] civilians, and [number]
Contract Manpower Equivalents. We anticipate the affect on these employees as follows: [number] will
be offered other Government employment, [number] will retire, and [number] will be involuntarily
separated from Government employment.


This [streamlined competition or standard competition] was conducted in compliance with the Air
Force policies in AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program, which implements the Office of
Management and Budget Circular (OMBC) A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities. This Circular
reaffirms the Government’s policy to rely on the private sector for commercial products and services.
When agency performance of commercial activities is not required for national defense reasons and
contracting is more cost effective, conversion to contract performance is in the best interest of the
American taxpayer.


When a public-private competition between an agency and private sector contractor performance
determines private sector contractor performance is more cost effective, OMBC A-76 and Federal
Acquisition Regulation require the private sector contractor to offer adversely affected civilian and NAF
employees the Right of First Refusal for employment openings to positions (under the contract) for
which they are qualified. Since DoD is sensitive to the personal impact this action may have on civilian
employees, the DoD Program for Stability of Civilian Employment ensures every effort is made to help
adversely affected civilian employees who desire placement assistance. These employees may register
in the Defense-wide computerized Priority Placement Program. Registrants under this program receive
placement rights to vacancies within DoD (other Federal agencies are also solicited). When adversely
affected civilian employees must relocate to continue Federal employment, transportation and moving
expenses are paid by the Government.

                IMPLEMENTATION, POST COMPETITION ACCOUNTABILITY,
              OPTION YEARS OF PERFORMANCE, FOLLOW-ON COMPETITION,
                                 AND TERMINATION

10.1. Policy. This chapter provides guidance for implementing the Final Decision, conducting and
reporting Post Competition Accountability (PCA) requirements, conducting follow-on competitions, ter-
minations, and exemption requests for an MEO follow-on competitions.
      10.1.1. The MEO Responsible Official in the Continuing Government Organization (CGO) is respon-
      sible for maintaining the integrity of the public-private competition by ensuring performance decision
      results are properly implemented and continuously maintained.
      10.1.2. The servicing Manpower and Organization activity will maintain updated public-private com-
      petitions file (see paragraph 10.9.1.5.7. for public-private competition file contents). If the pub-
      lic-private competition results in an MEO performance decision, the MEO will operate within costs
      and perform requirements as defined in the Letter of Obligation (LOO). All changes to the LOO will
      be coordinated through the servicing Manpower and Organization activity by utilizing the Qualified
      Adjustment Request (QAR) method IAW paragraph 10.3.
      10.1.3. The MEO will perform IAW the LOO (includes competition file as defined in paragraph
      10.9.1.5.7.) and all approved modifications, including PCA requirements, until one of the following
      conditions occur:
         10.1.3.1. A follow-on streamlined or standard competition is conducted.
         10.1.3.2. The commercial activity is recategorized as military essential with approval from the
         Component Competitive Sourcing Official (CCSO).
         10.1.3.3. The requirement for the CA is eliminated (e.g., no longer a recurring service or conve-
         nience to the government).
      10.1.4. MEOs are fundamentally AF-operated CAs governed by AF directives and the budget pro-
      cess. MEOs do not have immunity from HHQ-imposed reductions.
         10.1.4.1. Lower funding levels may compel commanders to reduce either the quality or quantity
         of the workload described in the PWS or terminate the activity altogether.
         10.1.4.2. When reducing MEO manpower authorizations, workload requirements will be simi-
         larly reduced or eliminated to ensure the continued successful operation of the mission.
         10.1.4.3. Fencing MEOs from reductions is a command determination.
         10.1.4.4. When MEO manning shortfalls occur, an interim workforce is permitted IAW paragraph
         10.6.
         10.1.4.5. As a result of changes to the LOO via the QAR, equipment inventories and/or facility
         space may be changed. Documentation supporting the changes will be retained and maintained in
         the public-private competition file to justify these changes.
         10.1.4.6. Material and supply costs may vary throughout the performance period. As such, the
         fluctuations in costs are sometimes beyond the control of the MEO managers. Except for
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                123


      approved PWS modifications, costs should not vary significantly from those estimated at the time
      of the public-private competition.
      10.1.4.7. Each wing/installation will stand up a Multi-Functional Team (MFT). The MFT will be
      chaired by a commander or equivalent (may delegate) at the proper level for oversight of the
      MEO. Team members should include: Commander (or designee) as the chair, MEO Responsible
      Official (may be the commander), MEO Chief, Contracting representative (in an advisory role),
      Financial Management representative, Civilian Personnel representative, servicing Manpower and
      Organization representative, Quality Assurance (QA) personnel, Services when any NAFI is
      involved, and others as deemed necessary. The MFT will convene during the phase-in period and
      at the end of each performance period to certify the MEO for exercising the next option year.
      10.1.4.8. At some locations, a Program Management Office (PMO) is organized and charged with
      many of the CGO and servicing Manpower and Organization activity responsibilities. At these
      locations, the MFT must ensure the Performance Plan clearly delegates all responsibilities. The
      PMO will be established at an appropriate level (i.e., Squadron, Group, Wing, or Command)
      depending on the organizational boundaries affected. PMOs, if used, will not be grouped with
      other support activities such as the servicing Manpower and Organization activity or Contracting
      Office.

10.2. MEO Implementation. This section provides procedures to ensure the MEO is implemented and
operates IAW the LOO.
   10.2.1. The MEO Responsible Official and servicing Manpower and Organization activity will over-
   see the MEO implementation IAW the Phase-in Plan.
   10.2.2. If the MEO cannot be implemented IAW the Phase-in Plan and/or unforeseen circumstances
   are discovered, promptly notify the MFT. Cost or performance deficiencies will be corrected to main-
   tain the integrity of the public-private competition results.
      10.2.2.1. When corrective changes cause an MEO to exceed the original phase-in costs, the MEO
      Responsible Official will submit a QAR IAW paragraph 10.3.
      10.2.2.2. Revised phase-in milestones will be completed using the QAR process. If deficiencies
      cannot be corrected within the period specified by the revised milestones, the MEO will be in
      default, and the activity will be scheduled for another public-private competition.
   10.2.3. Timing of Implementation.
      10.2.3.1. Where a solicitation was issued, the solicitation governs the MEO start date and
      phase-in provisions.
      10.2.3.2. Where market research was used (i.e., streamlined competition), the implementation
      will be completed IAW the timelines reflected in the Phase-in Plan (as applicable).
      10.2.3.3. The incumbent workforce will fully support the transition efforts outlined in the
      Phase-in Plan to ensure an orderly transition to the MEO operations.
   10.2.4. Phase-in Certification. The MFT will certify completion of all required Phase-in Plan actions
   necessary to implement and staff an MEO. The servicing Manpower and Organization activity will
   assist the MFT in the certification of the MEO. The certification will be maintained in the public-pri-
   vate competition file.

10.3. Qualified Adjustment Request (QAR).
      10.3.1. A QAR is a standardized method used to document, staff, and receive written approval for
      MEO LOO and performance cost changes.
      10.3.2. The MEO Responsible Official will coordinate with the servicing Manpower and Organiza-
      tion activity to keep the PWS and Performance Plan current. Changes that affect PWS requirements
      or PWS appendices (e.g., work counts and GFP) are updated through the QAR (Figure 10.2.).
      10.3.3. Cost Adjustments. Adjustments to the original Agency Cost Estimate (ACE) after the perfor-
      mance decision may include changes in scope/mission, inflation, overtime, grades, number of work
      years, etc. This is the Adjusted ACE.
         10.3.3.1. Qualified Cost Adjustments. These include approved and resourced cost adjustments to
         the MEO following the award decision.
         10.3.3.2. Nonqualified Cost Adjustments. These include pending cost adjustments and will be
         considered in the evaluation of nonperformance.
      10.3.4. Performance Costs. These include the actual MEO costs from the Defense Civilian Pay Sys-
      tem (DCPS) and the Commander’s Resource Integration System (CRIS), categorized as qualified or
      nonqualified, and public-private competition costs.
         10.3.4.1. Qualified or Nonqualified Costs. Indicates whether the DCPS or CRIS expense is a
         legitimate charge or if the expenditure is against the MEO. A charge is legitimate if the expense
         is authorized within the scope of the LOO, is authorized in the Adjusted ACE, or is due to an
         accounting discrepancy.
         10.3.4.2. Public-Private Competition Costs. These include COMPARE rates and factors used in
         the public-private competition for overhead, insurance, and military (if included in the MEO).
         These costs are not included in DCPS and CRIS; however, they are needed to equalize the
         Adjusted ACE to the performance costs for comparison.
      10.3.5. A QAR will be approved/disapproved at the level authorized (e.g., unit, wing and command)
      to commit the needed resources.

10.4. MEO Post Competition Accountability (PCA). Applies to MEOs with a final decision date on or
after 29 May 2003.

      Streamlined and Standard Competitions, performance monitoring will be accomplished regardless of
      the selected service provider. Post Competition Accountability includes:
         10.4.1.1. Monitoring, collecting, and reporting performance and cost for all performance periods.

         10.4.1.2. Retaining the solicitation, LOO, and all other documentation from the streamlined or
         standard competition as part of the public-private competition file.
         10.4.1.3. Using ACTT to track MEOs performance costs.
         10.4.1.4. Ensuring MEO positions retain appropriate IGCA code.
      10.4.2. An MEO will operate within the costs estimated in the public-private competition (adjusted
      for scope, inflation, and wage rate changes).
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                               125


      10.4.2.1. The MEO may exercise latitude in resource management (e.g., overtime, grade changes,
      number of work years, and equipment) as long as the changes do not increase the total dollar
      amount of resources in the public-private competition results.
      10.4.2.2. Exceptions are made for approved workload and mission changes documented in the
      PWS through a QAR.
   10.4.3. MEO reporting will be conducted quarterly with reports due in January, April, July, and Octo-
   ber for the previous quarter. Reports will be attached to the DCAMIS record via the servicing Man-
   power and Organization activity.
   10.4.4. An MEO review and certification will be completed at the end of each performance period.
   10.4.5. PCA MEO Viability Assessment. AFMA/MAC will conduct an MEO viability assessment on
   a minimum of 20 percent of all MEOs per year, upon request at any time prior to an MEO entering P3
   for a follow-on competition or if the MEO is seeking an exemption request.
      10.4.5.1. At a minimum, an MEO viability assessment will ensure:
          10.4.5.1.1. All MEO documentation is up-to-date (e.g., scope of work and work counts).
          10.4.5.1.2. The MEO meets or exceeds standards as identified in the Performance Plan.
          10.4.5.1.3. The MEO cost of performance is within the adjusted ACE.
      10.4.5.2. MEO viability assessments will be conducted through an offsite assessment, Staff Assis-
      tance Visit (SAV), or both.
      10.4.5.3. MEO viability assessment results will be summarized in a cover memo and forwarded to
      AF/A1MS. Results in report format will be forwarded to the applicable Command/A1M and the
      MEO Responsible Official, along with the cover memo provided to AF/A1MS. AF/A1MS will
      provide information copies of MEO viability assessments to appropriate Air Staff Functionals.

10.5. Option Years of Performance and Follow-on Competition.
   10.5.1. Contract Performance. The Contracting Officer will exercise options with a contractor, if
   applicable, IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
   10.5.2. MEO Performance. If the MEO is performing and within costs, the MFT will certify the
   MEO and the MEO will enter into the next performance period. If the MEO is not performing and/or
   within costs, see paragraph 10.7.
   10.5.3. Follow-on Competitions. When conducting a follow-on competition, P3 should begin 18
   months prior to the end of the final performance period. Submit an e-mail notifying AF/A1MS, with
   a courtesy copy to AFMA/MAC, of intent to begin P3. A streamlined or standard competition should
   be completed before the end of the final performance period.
      10.5.3.1. Section 2461 (a) of Title 10, U.S.C., does not require MEOs to conduct follow-on com-
      petitions at the end of the performance period specified in the LOO. This section does not prohibit
      follow-on competitions but provides flexibility to conduct follow-on competitions when appropri-
      ate. MEOs whose last performance period have ended and are not part of a follow-on competition
      will be considered standard Air Force organizations susceptible to Air Force policies and proce-
      dures.
126                                                                            AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


      10.5.4. MEOs operating within their authorized performance periods that complete another stream-
      lined or standard competition of the activity by the end of the last performance period and MEOs that
      continue to monitor performance via PCA procedures for periods of performance beyond those desig-
      nated in the LOO qualify for follow-on competition MEO programming procedures. This means no
      expected savings will be programmed. Additionally, those expired MEOs not monitoring PCA per-
      formance will usually be programmed for 10 percent savings upon being part of a public-private com-
      petition.

10.6. Interim Corrective Actions. When manning shortfalls occur, an interim workforce is permitted on
an emergency basis and/or equipment/facilities may be adjusted to improve conditions. Interim is defined
as less than one year.
      10.6.1. If a longer period of corrective action is required, the Command/A1M will submit written jus-
      tification to AF/A1M for approval.
      10.6.2. An interim workforce is not allowed to permanently correct manpower deficiencies.
      10.6.3. An interim workforce may be private sector contractor, public reimbursable source, or gov-
      ernment personnel; however, workload previously performed by MEO civilian employee authoriza-
      tions cannot be supplemented by contracts without a public-private competition, except as noted in
      paragraph 10.6.3.2.
         10.6.3.1. Military personnel may be used temporarily when civilian employees are unavailable.
         Military personnel may not be substituted for civilians in an MEO on a permanent basis.
         10.6.3.2. When government personnel are unavailable and while pending resolution of manning
         problems, contracts may be used to assist on a one-time, nonrecurring basis for up to one year.
         Contracted workload must be separable and may not result in a personal services contract.
      10.6.4. Equipment and facilities may be adjusted to improve conditions, if these changes and correc-
      tive actions would normally be allowed under a contract operation, if offsetting savings would occur,
      or for normal replacement. Retain documentation to justify these changes.
      10.6.5. Interim corrective actions will be documented in the public-private competition file.

10.7. Termination. The Contracting Officer has the authority and responsibility to terminate contracts,
in whole or in part, for convenience of the Government or for default (nonperformance). The Contracting
Officer does not have authority to make a decision to terminate/decertify an MEO or to affect the civilian
positions in an MEO.
      10.7.1. Termination/Decertification.
         10.7.1.1. When an MEO fails to meet PCA compliance requirements for costs and/or perfor-
         mance, the MEO Responsible Official will notify the MFT Chair of the need to convene to resolve
         the costs and/or performance issue(s). At this same time, the MFT Chair will notify the Contract-
         ing Officer to issue a show-cause or cure notice to the MEO Chief to meet the intent of FAR, Part
         49. The MFT will convene to attempt to resolve the issue(s). If the MFT determines the MEO
         issue(s) cannot be resolved and the MEO status should be terminated, the MFT Chair will direct
         the Contracting Officer to terminate the LOO. The servicing Manpower and Organization activity
         will then recode the IGCA inventory to reflect a CA rather than MEO. A streamlined or standard
         competition will be scheduled as soon as possible.
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                  127


      10.7.1.2. For an MEO where a follow-on competition cannot be completed by the end of the last
      performance period a streamlined or standard competition will be scheduled as soon as possible.
   10.7.2. Private Sector Contractor Termination. If the Contracting Officer determines a private sector
   contractor has failed to perform to the extent a termination for default is justified, the Contracting
   Officer will issue a notice of termination, IAW FAR, Part 49.
   10.7.3. Temporary Remedies. If the Contracting Officer terminates a contract, or is directed to termi-
   nate a LOO by the MFT due to service provider’s failure to correct deficient performance, interim
   contracts, public reimbursable sources, or government personnel may be used on an emergency basis.
   These temporary remedies will not be used for longer than one year from the date of termination.
   10.7.4. MEO Special Considerations.
      10.7.4.1. An MEO cannot be required to operate under unworkable conditions (e.g., increased
      workload without an equitable adjustment in resources). If an MEO is not performing due to
      unworkable conditions, the MEO Responsible Official is held accountable. Additionally, the
      MEO cannot be held accountable for contractor performance (i.e., MEO subcontracts) wherein it
      is the contracting officer’s responsible for the contractors who perform part of the work that was
      grouped together for competition purposes.
      10.7.4.2. A new public-private competition is not required when adjusting an MEO with increas-
      ing costs or changing PWS requirements (including QARs) that meet or exceed expansion criteria
      in paragraph 11.1.3. The IGCA inventory coding is changed to reflect the activity(s) is no longer
      performed by an MEO. Immediately request P3 IAW Chapter 3.
   10.7.5. Terminations Based on Reasons Other than Failure to Perform. If performance by the Gov-
   ernment (MEO or public reimbursable source) or by a private sector contractor is to be terminated for
   reasons other than failure to perform, the DoD CSO (without delegation) will approve such termina-
   tions, in writing, and provide a copy to OMB before the termination. Examples of these terminations
   include, but are not limited to, elimination of an agency requirement through divestiture, privatization,
   reorganization, restructuring, national defense, or homeland security. Since termination settlement
   costs may be incurred, Contracting Officers must determine if allowing the contract to expire (i.e.,
   contract options are not exercised) rather than terminating for convenience, during a performance
   period, is in the best interest of the Government.

10.8. MEO Follow-On Exemption Request for High Performing Organizations (HPO).
   10.8.1. Policy. MEO and public reimbursable performance decisions may apply for a specific exemp-
   tion (HPO) granted by the DoD CSO (without delegation) in accordance with OMBC A-76 or more
   current DoD guidance.
      10.8.1.1. The DoD CSO may extend the performance period for high performing organizations if
      the DoD CSO (a) determines the continued cost savings justifies the extension; (b) documents
      these cost savings through the use of a COMPARE-generated SCF/SLCF (c) limits the extension
      to no more than 3 years after the last performance period; and (d) makes a formal announcement
      of the extension via FedBizOpps.gov.
      10.8.1.2. The term “high performing organization” means an AF organization that performs com-
      mercial activities and whose cost efficiency and performance meet or exceed that of comparable
      public or private service providers.
128                                                                            AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


      10.8.2. This section provides guidance to comply with OMBC A-76, Attachment B, paragraph E.5.b
      and DoD guidance.
         10.8.2.1. An MEO Responsible Official may request an MEO follow-on exemption if the follow-
         ing criteria are met:
             10.8.2.1.1. The MEO is a result of a public-private competition with decision rationale based
             on lower cost.
             10.8.2.1.2. The original SLCF/SCF has the actual private sector cost proposal entered on Line
             7. For streamlined competitions performed using market research and analysis rather than a
             solicitation, the HPO nomination package shall explain how the original market research and
             analysis was performed and document that the resulting MEO has achieved or exceeded the
             savings projected in the public-private competition.
             10.8.2.1.3. The scoping and grouping of the activities in the MEO are consistent with today’s
             market and industry.
             10.8.2.1.4. A LOO was issued to the MEO that identified each performance period in the
             competition and reflects the agency tender submitted to the contracting officer in the competi-
             tion.
             10.8.2.1.5. The MEO was implemented in accordance with the phase-in plan in the agency
             tender.
             10.8.2.1.6. Post competition accountability of the MEO has been performed in accordance
             with Chapter 10.
             10.8.2.1.7. The MEO continues to meet the performance requirements and standards stated in
             the LOO and these standards are consistent with the current PWS.
             10.8.2.1.8. The MEO’s cost of performance is the same or less than the agency cost estimate
             on the SCF/SLCF used to make a final decision and that cost adjustments are based upon cor-
             responding changes (via Qualified Adjustment Request) in the LOO/PWS or updates to stan-
             dard cost factors.
             10.8.2.1.9. The Performance Plan and QCP have been updated to reflect documented changes
             to the LOO/PWS since final decision.
             10.8.2.1.10. Performance assessments have been conducted in accordance with the Perfor-
             mance Plan, that these assessments have been conducted by an individual(s) who is indepen-
             dent of the MEO, and that the performance assessment substantiates that the MEO is meeting
             or exceeding performance standards stated in the LOO.
             10.8.2.1.11. Quality control assessments have been conducted by the MEO using a QCP.
             10.8.2.1.12. A revised SLCF/SCF documents that a continuation of the MEO’s performance
             will continue to generate savings.

10.9. Roles and Responsibilities.
      10.9.1. MEO Implementation. The following provides roles and responsibilities, as well as process
      steps to implement an MEO.

MEMORANDUM FOR AF/A1M

FROM: [Command/A1M]

Subject: Most Efficient Organization Follow-on Exemption for a High Performing Organization Request

1. The following information supports the nomination of [Organization ID], [Activity Name] Most Efficient
Organization (MEO), DCAMIS Number [DCAMIS Number], for a follow-on competition exemption request in
accordance with OMB Circular A-76, dated 29 May 2003 (revised), Attachment B, Section E., paragraph 5.b., and
AFI 38-203, paragraph 10.8.

   a. Decision Rationale. The [Activity Name] MEO is the result of a public-private competition with a
decision rationale based on lower cost as reflected in DCAMIS Data Element 3-34.
   b. Packaging. [Detail why the scope and grouping of the MEO activities are consistent with today’s
market and industry compared to the market when the original public-private competition was announced. (
For example, IT-related activities packaged for a public-private competition that was announced nine years ago
would more than likely not be grouped the same in today’s market place].
   c. MEO Implementation. The results of the independent review documenting MEO implementation
are as follows:

      (1) Implementation Review. A review of the MEO validating implementation by either AFMA/MAC or
the Air Force Audit Agency was completed on [date] by [individual(s) with expertise to perform evaluation who
are independent of the MEO].
      (2) Implementation Documentation. Review documentation is attached (Atch 1) that details the following:

          (a) The MEO was implemented in accordance with the Phase-in Plan.
          (b) The MEO has been performing the requirements stated in the PWS.
          (c) The MEO cost of performance is in line with the agency cost estimate on the SLCF/SCF used to
make a final decision.
          (d) Since the final decision was determined, the MEO has documented all adjustments to the MEO
and Agency Cost Estimate, and these adjustments have corresponding documented changes to the PWS, scope,
inflation, and wage rate adjustments.

       d. MEO Performance Review:

      (1) [Insert a statement that regular performance assessments have been conducted in accordance with the
            Performance Plan. The assessments were conducted by an individual independent of the MEO
            [name]. The quality assurance assessment substantiates that the MEO is meeting or exceeding the
          performance standards (including customer satisfaction) stated in the PWS within the MEO resources.
          The Performance Plan has taken into account documented changes to the PWS since the final
          decision.
      (2) [Insert a statement that the MEO has conducted quality control assessments using a Quality Control
           Plan (QCP) (or similar self-assessment approach) [e.g., daily, weekly, monthly]. The QCP has taken
           into account changes to the PWS since the final decision was determined.]

(Continued).


e. Cost Savings Documentation. The Competition Form documents that a continuation of the MEO performance
will generate additional savings (Atch 2). The Agency Cost Estimate for the MEO has been calculated in
accordance with the OMB Circular A-76 and is based on the PWS. Costs entered on SLCF/SCF Line 7 were
prepared by a Contracting Officer who conducted market research in accordance with the FAR to determine a fair
and reasonable contract price for Line 7.

                                                 Chapter 11

      EXPANSIONS, NEW REQUIREMENTS, AND CONVERSIONS FROM CONTRACT TO
                            AGENCY PERFORMANCE

11.1. Policy. This chapter provides guidance for agency expansions, new requirements, conversions from
contract to agency performance.
      11.1.1. As stated in 10 U.S.C. 2463, the CCSO may use economic analysis in lieu of A-76 public-pri-
      vate competition to determine the low cost provider with respect to new requirements, expansions,
      and conversions from contract to agency performance (unless the existing contract was awarded under
      A-76). The use of 10 U.S.C. 2463 is subject to certain limitations. MAJCOMs will contact AF/
      A1MS when considering 10 U.S.C. 2463 actions.
      11.1.2. This chapter does not apply to NAFIs. The Air Reserve Components will use this chapter
      when applicable.
      11.1.3. Expansion. An expansion is a 30 percent or more increase in the annual operating costs or
      total capital investment of an existing AF CA based on modernization, replacement, upgrade, or
      increased workload over an annual performance period. Expansions do not require a new public-pri-
      vate competition.
         11.1.3.1. Submit any expansion that drives resource bills (FTEs and/or dollars) to the appropriate
         level authorized to commit the needed resources (wing, command, and AF) for approval.
             11.1.3.1.1. Submit expansion requests annually in time to be included in the programming
             process.
             11.1.3.1.2. Expansion requests will be validated by the functional and manpower at the wing,
             command, or Air Staff. If approved, they will be funded from wing, command, or Air Staff
             resources.
             11.1.3.1.3. If funding is needed prior to the first open POM cycle, the command will have to
             absorb the cost for near-term funding.
      11.1.4. New Requirement. A newly established need for an AF CA that is not currently performed by
      the agency, public reimbursable tender, or contract. A public-private competition is not required for
      new requirements before assigning DoD civilian employees.
         11.1.4.1. An activity that is reengineered, reorganized, modernized, upgraded, expanded or
         changed to become more efficient, but still essentially performs the same service is not considered
         a new requirement.
         11.1.4.2. Government facilities and equipment normally are not expanded to accommodate new
         requirements if adequate and cost-effective private sector contractor facilities are available. The
         requirement for Government ownership of facilities does not preclude the possibility of contract
         operation. If justification for agency source is dependent on relative cost, the public-private com-
         petition process will be delayed to accommodate the lead-time necessary for acquiring the facili-
         ties.
      11.1.5. Conversions from Contract to Agency Performance. Contracted AF commercial activities
      may be converted to agency performance if one of the following circumstances exists: unreasonable
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                 145


   contract price or unsatisfactory quality have become an issue, contracted workload to be included in a
   NAFI MOA (see paragraph 7.2.3.), contracted workload to be included in a public-private competi-
   tion, or provisions included under paragraph 11.1.1.
       11.1.5.1. Contract Price/Quality. When the price of an existing contract appears unreasonable or
       quality of performance becomes unsatisfactory, efforts should first be made to resolve the issues
       by partnering with the private sector contractor. If resolution cannot be achieved, resoliciting the
       requirement should be considered. If resolicitation does not resolve the issues, the commander
       may elect to initiate preliminary planning.
       11.1.5.2. Contracted Workload to be Included in a Public-Private Competition.
          11.1.5.2.1. The same policies and procedures apply for a conversion from private sector con-
          tractor competition as for a standard competition except the conversion differential is added to
          the cost of agency performance. The conversion differential does not apply if the agency per-
          formance will be under a NAFI MOA.
          11.1.5.2.2. If the results of the public-private competition determine agency performance is
          more cost effective, the command’s contract funding will be decreased by the cost of the con-
          tract, programmed out of the command’s FYDP and authorizations for the MEO will be allo-
          cated to the command. Contract administration costs (previously allocated) will be used to
          administer the Letter of Obligation.
       11.1.5.3. Mission. When mission changes or wartime taskings dictate a review of a contracted CA
       is appropriate, a review will be accomplished. When the results of the review indicate the agency
       operation is justified as a military essential requirement and meets the criteria established in
       Chapter 2, a competition is not required based on mission changes or wartime taskings that
       require military performance.

11.2. Roles and Responsibilities.
   11.2.1. AF/A1M will:
       11.2.1.1. Provide oversight on functional requests to return a contracted AF commercial activity
       to agency performance by a performance reimbursable source. These actions may require SAF/
       AQ, SAF/GC, AF/JA, and the FAM(s) coordination. AF/A1M approval is required to migrate
       UTCs.
       11.2.1.2. Reprogram contract funding and/or manpower resources/authorizations, as needed.
   11.2.2. AF Functional will:
       11.2.2.1. Validate and approve/disapprove funding for AF-level expansion requests. Support cen-
       tralized programming for validated increased requirements within the Air Force Corporate Struc-
       ture POM/APOM process.
       11.2.2.2. Forward written justification to AF/A1M for the conversion from contract to agency
       performance, as required.
   11.2.3. Command Functional Area Manager (FAM) will forward written justification for the con-
   version from contract to agency performance to AF/A1M. In the case of converting from contract to
   military agency performance, AF/A1M approval is required to migrate UTCs.
146                                                                         AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


      11.2.4. Command/A1 (or equivalent) or designated representative will:
         11.2.4.1. Submit requests for expansions that cannot be funded at command level to AF for vali-
         dation and funding through program element monitors on the appropriate POM panels.
         11.2.4.2. Validate new requirements prior to programming for additional resources.
         11.2.4.3. Program for any costs (FTEs or dollars) driven by expansions.
         11.2.4.4. Validate requests for preliminary planning for conversion from contract to agency per-
         formance and forward written justification to AF/A1M for approval.
         11.2.4.5. Provide programming inputs to AF/A1MS to adjust contract funding and command
         FYDP when contract price/quality or contract public-private competitions result in an agency
         decision.
      11.2.5. Command or Servicing Manpower and Organization Activity will:
         11.2.5.1. Review and staff requests for preliminary planning for conversion from contractor to
         agency performance to Command/A1 (or equivalent).
         11.2.5.2. Validate and staff Most Efficient Organization (MEO) expansions including command
         funding for the expansion. Forward command approved expansion requests to AF for approval
         and funding (if command is unable to fund).
         11.2.5.3. Update the IGCA RSC codes to reflect the appropriate inventory coding.
      11.2.6. Servicing Contracting Officer will determine if expansions, new requirements, and conver-
      sions to agency performance work is within an existing contract scope and nature.

                                             Chapter 12

 COMPETITIVE SOURCING & PRIVATIZATION (CS&P) PANEL FYDP PROGRAMMING
                       RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

12.1. Policy. This chapter provides guidance on FYDP programming actions related to A-76 public-pri-
vate competitions.
   12.1.1. Normally, FYDP programming for A-76 initiatives containing fully funded manpower posi-
   tions are programmed in two parts: generally at public announcement, and at completion of the com-
   petition. For initiatives containing other than fully funded manpower positions (PBD 710 BtB, etc.),
   commands will follow supplemental guidance issued by AF/A1MS.
   12.1.2. Funding available to commands to pay A-76 performance decisions is not restricted solely to
   the 595 account. There are funds within the organization's Operations & Maintenance (O&M) budget
   (supply, materials, equipment, existing contracts, etc.) from which commands should obtain supple-
   mental dollars to fund A-76 competition decisions.

12.2. Commands will:
   12.2.1. Programming actions, via RAPIDS, using only W800-series Change Control Numbers
   (CCNs), as part of their entire POM submission rather than separate actions through the CS&P or
   other Air Force Corporate Structure Panels. Submit separate RAPIDS slides for each transaction
   (announcement or completion), unless otherwise instructed by the CS&P Panel.
   12.2.2. Submit RAPIDS slides during the first available budget exercise for public-private competi-
   tion announcements containing fully funded manpower positions for which no previous FYDP pro-
   gramming has occurred.

12.3. Public-Private Competition Announcement Programming.
   12.3.1. 100 percent of the military and civilian end strength will be programmed out of the command
   FYDP and military/civilian pay dollars into the AF EEIC 595.
   12.3.2. New standard competitions will be programmed for 25 percent savings while new streamlined
   competitions will be programmed for 10 percent savings into the AF withhold account (EEIC 595).
   Programmed savings will not be taken for follow-on competitions.

12.4. Public-Private Performance Decision Programming.
   12.4.1. For contract decisions, necessary dollars will be programmed from the AF EEIC 595 account
   to the command’s EEIC 592 contract account to pay for contract decisions.
   12.4.2. For AT decisions, necessary dollars will be programmed from the AF EEIC 595 account to
   command’s EEIC 392 account to cover Civ Pay for an AT decision and add corresponding civilian end
   strength to the command FYDP.
   12.4.3. Regarding performance decision programming, if a budget exercise window of opportunity is
   missed, dollars will flow from the AF EEIC 595 account to either the command contract account or
   civilian pay account as a year-of-execution transaction (with the MEO using over-hire authority in
148                                                                          AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


      lieu of programmed FTEs) until the next available Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution
      (PPBE) cycle exercise.
      12.4.4. Commands should pay particular attention to the programming and dollar issues for new
      announcements containing funded military end strength. OMB timelines (90 days and 12 months) for
      Streamlined and Standard Competitions, respectively) will have a profound impact on the success of
      A-76 public-private competition decision implementation. Headquarters Air Force (HAF) cannot
      re-program MilPers dollars to make them available to fund A-76 outcomes sooner than two years.
      This means there will possibly be up to a one-year "lag" between public-private competition comple-
      tion and available funding (depending on number of military end strength). This "lag" can be miti-
      gated in one of several ways:
         12.4.4.1. Consider "when" the programmed funding will be available (two years from announce-
         ment) and schedule competition decision transition to coincide -- delaying performance transition
         until said time when the programming can "catch up."
         12.4.4.2. Depending on an individual public-private competition's military/civilian mix, com-
         mands can choose to fund the public-private competition outcome with other available O&M
         funds in the year of execution for the first year until programming can "catch up."

12.5. In-Progress or Recently Completed Public-Private Competitions. Supplemental guidance as
issued by AF/A1MS will be followed.

12.6. Roles and Responsibilities. Commands will:
      12.6.1. Include FYDP A-76 programming actions, via RAPIDS, as part of their entire POM submis-
      sion vice separate actions through the CS&P or other Air Force Corporate Structure Panels.
      12.6.2. Submit RAPIDS slides during the first available budget exercise for public-private competi-
      tion announcements containing fully funded manpower positions for which no previous FYDP pro-
      gramming has occurred.
      12.6.3. In the event of MEO establishment, ensure separate Responsibility Center/Cost Centers are
      established for the new MEO.

Terms

The official US Air Force definition for some of these terms is contained in AFDD1-2, Air Force
Glossary. Additional terms can be found in OMBC A-76. These definitions are for the purpose of
this Instruction only.
595 Account—AF created account to hold funds for A-76 results.
A-76 Cost Tracking Tool (ACTT)—The AF automated/standardized tool for tracking and reporting
post-award performance costs. The ACTT provides a method to capture the studied AF CA operating
costs regardless of service provider for all performance periods.
Acquisition Strategy Plan (ASP)—Systematic and disciplined approach toward achieving an
economical, high-quality result.
Activity—A specific task or grouping of tasks that provides a specialized capability, service or product
based on a recurring government requirement. Depending on the grouping of tasks, an activity may be an
entire activity or may be a part of an activity. An activity may be inherently governmental or commercial
in nature.
Adversely Affected Employees—Federal civilian employees serving competitive or excepted service
appointments in Tenure Groups I, II, or III, who are identified for release from their competitive level by
an agency, IAW 5 CFR Part 351 and 5 U.S.C. Chapter 35, as a direct result of a performance decision
resulting from a streamlined or standard competition.
Agency Cost Estimate (ACE)—For a standard competition, the part of the agency tender in a standard
competition that includes the agency’s cost proposal and represents the full cost of agency performance of
the AF CA, based on the requirements in the solicitation and the costing policy from the DoD Costing
Manual and more current OMB, DoD and AF guidance. For a streamlined competition, the ACE is the
agency tender and is developed IAW the DoD Costing Manual and more current OMB, DoD and AF
guidance.
Agency Performance—Performance of a commercial or inherently governmental activity with
government personnel. Often referred to as “in-house performance.”
Agency Source—A service provider staffed by government personnel.
Agency Tender (AT)—The agency management plan submitted in response to a solicitation for a
standard competition. The AT includes an MEO, agency cost estimate, MEO quality control plan, MEO
Phase-in Plan, and copies of any existing MEO subcontracts (with the private sector providers’
proprietary information redacted). The AT is prepared IAW the solicitation requirements and this
instruction. For a streamlined competition, the agency tender consists of the agency cost estimate (ACE).
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                     157


However, if an MEO is developed during the streamlined competition, then a management plan is
required along with the ACE.
Agency Tender Official (ATO)—An inherently governmental agency official with decision-making
authority who is responsible for the agency tender and represents the agency tender during source
selection.
Agency Tender Team—A group of individuals, comprised of technical and functional experts, formed to
assist the ATO in developing the agency tender.
Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA) Review—Provides AF management with independent, objective, and
quality audit services that include: reviewing and promoting economy, effectiveness, and efficiency of
operations; evaluating programs and activities and assisting management in achieving intended results;
assessing and improving AF fiduciary stewardship and the accuracy of financial reporting.
Air Force Inherently Governmental/Commercial Activities Inventory—An inventory of all Air
Force in-house activities (both inherently governmental and commercial activities) and contracted
commercial activities.
Annualize—The calculation method to convert a cost to an annual basis. The calculation converts a cost
for a performance period that is less than one full year into an annual cost to correctly reflect the cost in a
government cost estimate. This calculation is performed by first dividing the cost in the performance
period by the number of days in the performance period to determine the corresponding daily cost and
then multiplying the daily cost by 365.25, to account for leap years.
Annual Planning and Programming Guidance (APPG)—The Annual Planning and Programming
Guidance identifies near and mid-term AF planning and programming endeavors as well as long-term
program development, provides the basis for accountability, assures AF progress toward long-range
strategic goals and defines the future force and requisite support for the POM build.
Appropriation—The categories of funding enacted by Congress to permit the AF to obligate and expend
funds for acquiring, implementing, operating, maintaining, and supporting its mission functions and
activities. The military is required to use appropriated dollars for these purposes and are not allowed to
move money across appropriations without congressional consent. Money can be moved internal to
appropriations (with some restrictions) without congressional consent.
Basic Pay—Basic pay for General Schedule employees is a position’s annual salary plus any other
applicable civilian employee pay entitlements. Basic pay for Federal Wage System (FWS) employees is
a position’s annual wages including shift differential pay and environmental pay, plus any other
applicable civilian employee pay entitlements. Examples of other civilian employee pay entitlements
include, but are not limited to, night differential pay for FWS employees, environmental differential pay,
and premium pay (for civilian employee fire fighters and law enforcement officers).
Bid—An offer made in response to an Invitation for Bid in Sealed Bid acquisitions.
Budget Year—Next fiscal year beyond the current fiscal year, i.e., upcoming fiscal year.
Bundling—Consolidating two or more requirements for supplies or services, previously provided or
performed under separate smaller contracts by a small business concern/small service provider into a
single contract that is likely to be unsuitable for award to a small business concern due to diversity, size,
dollar value, etc. Bundling is addressed when establishing the acquisition strategy.
158                                                                           AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


Candidate—A proposed activity submitted for preliminary planning. If preliminary planning results in
an A-76 “Go” decision a streamlined or standard competition nomination for approval is submitted to the
command or AF. Upon AF/A1M approval for A-76 it is referred to as an initiative.
Capital Improvement—An expenditure for a physical improvement to an existing capital asset such as
additions and major alterations that are intended to improve performance or increase useful life.
Civilian Employee—U.S direct-hire DoD civilian personnel paid from appropriated funds and serving
on permanent appointments. Non-appropriated fund employees, direct hire non-US citizen employees,
indirect non-US citizen employees, temporary employees or term employees are not included in this
definition (see government personnel).
Civilian Employee Authorization—A DoD civilian employee position that is authorized by DoD,
funded through DoD appropriated funds or Defense working capital funds, allocated to a DoD
commercial activity, and expressed in terms of one year of full-time workload (see civilian employee and
full-time equivalent definitions).
Classification of Activities—Air Force SERVICES activities are classified into three categories for
determining the source of funding support authorized for each.
      Category A—Mission Sustaining Activities. These are programs essential to the military mission
      and must be provided in all but the most extenuating conditions, i.e., contingency operations.
      Consequently, these programs are authorized to receive maximum APF support. They also have the
      least capacity to generate revenue. The AF goal is 100 percent APF support where authorized for
      Category A activities. (Common support activities such as Resource Management Flight (RMF) and
      HRO are grouped in Category A for reporting purposes only. APF support is based on the functions
      performed by these activities, i.e., for purposes of Executive Control and Command Supervision
      (ECCS), APF support is authorized for equipment to include data automation equipment.)
      Category B—Basic Community Support Activities. These activities are community support
      programs with the capacity to generate some NAF revenue. They may be provided substantial
      support from APFs. This Category includes essential Air Force SERVICES activities that provide a
      fundamental core of the SERVICES programs at AF installations. The AF goal for APF support of
      Category B activities is 50 percent of direct costs.
      Category C—Revenue-Generating Activities. Category C activities have the highest capacity to
      generate revenue and are considered self-sustaining, capable of funding most expenses. Category C
      activities are considered desirable to the military community and make major contributions to mission
      accomplishments and personnel recruitment and retention. Category C activities are authorized
      indirect APF support and limited direct APF support. Direct APF support is authorized to correct
      health and safety deficiencies. Category C programs at designated remote and isolated locations are
      authorized the same type of funding as Category B programs.
Commander—The MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/Reserve commander, wing/installation/activity commander,
or the ANG director responsible for their Commercial Activities Program or a specific streamlined or
standard competition. The term commander also applies to those locations with civilian directors in lieu
of a military commander.
Commercial Activity (CA)—A recurring service that could be performed by the private sector. It may
be an entire organization or part of an organization. It must be a type of work that is separable from other
functions or activities so it is suitable for performance by contract. Commercial activities fall into two
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                159


categories: (1) in-house CA operated by AF military and/or civilian personnel and (2) contracted CA
operated by private sector contractor or another non-DoD Federal Agency (i.e., public reimbursable
source).
Common Costs—Specific costs identified in the solicitation that will be incurred by the government
regardless of the provider (private sector, public reimbursable, or agency). Common costs are sometimes
referred to as wash costs. Examples of common costs include government furnished property, security
clearances, and joint inventories.
Comparative Market Research (CMR)—CMR in A-76 public-private competitions is defined as the
systematic comparison of the function(s) being studied to the current market conditions in order to
estimate the price the Government would pay if the activity were to be outsourced to the private sector.
CMR may be used to determine the estimated private sector contractor price for activities performed by
less than 10 DoD civilian employee authorizations during a streamlined competition.
COMPARE—The Windows-based A-76 costing software that incorporates OMBC A-76 costing
procedures. COMPARE must be used to calculate and document the costs on the SLCF for a streamlined
competition or the SCF for a standard competition. The software is available through the SHARE A-76!
website.
COMPARE Tables—A specific set of master tables incorporated into the COMPARE costing software
that includes all of the approved standard cost factors and rates used to calculate the SLCF/SCF costs.
COMPARE User's Guide—A detailed guidebook for actual users of COMPARE that includes an
in-depth explanation of the use and features of the COMPARE software program.
COMPARE Version Control Log—This document describes each change made in a particular version
of the COMPARE software. This document includes a brief description of the change, the area of the
software program affected by the change, and the impact the change has on the SLCF/SCF and/or
documentation.
Competition Officials—The agency officials appointed before a standard competition is announced.
These individuals perform key roles and have essential responsibilities for the successful completion of
the standard competition. Competition officials may be appointed for a streamlined competition, as
needed. Competition officials are the Agency Tender Official, Contracting Officer, Source Selection
Authority, Human Resource Advisor, and PWS Team Leader.
Competitive Sourcing Decision Package (CSDP)—The decision package, based on research conducted
during preliminary planning, recommending the optimal methodology for sourcing an AF organization’s
CA services which is submitted to the project sponsor. Paragraph 3.3.8. outlines what is included in the
CSDP.
Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO)—An inherently governmental agency official responsible for the
implementation of OMBC A-76 within the agency (Department of Defense).
Component—An organizational grouping within an agency, such as a bureau, center, military service, or
field activity.
Component Competitive Sourcing Official (CCSO)—An inherently governmental component official
responsible for the implementation of OMBC A-76 within the component (Air Force).
Contest—Under provisions of FAR, Subpart 33.103, replaces administrative appeals. A directly
interested party may contest any of the following actions taken in connection with a standard competition:
160                                                                           AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


(1) a solicitation; (2) the cancellation of a solicitation; (3) a determination to exclude a tender or offer
from a standard competition; (4) a performance decision, including, but not limited to, compliance with
the costing provisions of OMBC A-76 and other elements in an agency's evaluation of offers and tenders;
or (5) a termination or cancellation of a contract or Letter of Obligation if the challenge contains an
allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the
performance decision. The pursuit of a contest by a directly interested party and the resolution of such
contest by the agency will be governed by the procedures of FAR, Subpart 33.103. No party may contest
any aspect of a streamlined competition. NOTE: The FAR references protests but the OMB Circular
A-76 references contests.
Continuing Government Organization (CGO)—Those activities, including inherently governmental
activities, extracted from a predominantly competeable organization and combined into one or more
noncompeteable organizations. Staffing for these organizations could include positions responsible for
the oversight of the service provider’s (AT, private sector, or public reimbursable) performance. The
duties and responsibilities may include, but are not limited to, performance management, and receipt,
inspection and acceptance of services. Care should be taken in separating these activities from the
organization(s) under public-private competition. The cost of these activities should be evaluated to
determine what percentage of expended time is spent as management of oversight activities for the AT.
Positions performing excluded activities may or may not be 100 percent dedicated to the activity being
competed. When a position is not 100 percent dedicated to the activity being competed, its cost must be
prorated to Line 1 of the SCF or SLCF according to the amount of dedicated time. The CGO may be
referred to as the Functional Area Staff (FAS).
Contract Administration—Contract administration is an inherently governmental activity. Contract
administration includes activities performed by warranted Contracting Officers, Contracting Officer’s
technical representatives, and related payment evaluation staff who evaluate private sector contractor
performance.
Contract Manpower Equivalent (CME)—Expressions of in-house manpower requirements that would
be necessary if contracted workload were performed in-house at the same level of service specified in the
contract. CME data is maintained in the manpower programming and execution system (MPES).
Contract Start Date—The date work is scheduled to begin under contract performance.
Contracting Officer (CO)—An inherently governmental agency official who participates on the PWS
Team, and is responsible for the issuance of the solicitation and the source selection evaluation
methodology. The CO awards the contract and establishes the MEO Letter of Obligation or
fee-for-service agreement resulting from a streamlined or standard competition. The CO and the SSA
may be the same individual.
Conversion Differential—Precludes conversions based on marginal estimated savings, and captures
nonquantifiable costs related to a conversion, such as disruption and decreased productivity.
Conversion From Contract—A change in the performance of an AF CA from a private sector provider
to agency (in-house) performance.
Conversion To Contract—The change in the performance of an AF CA from AF military and/or civilian
personnel to performance under contract by a private sector source.
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                  161


Core Logistics—Activities identified as core logistics are activities IAW 10 U.S.C. 2464. These
activities are performed by AF depots and not subject to A-76 public-private competitions; however, they
are subject to AF IGCA Inventory reporting requirements.
DoD Commercial Activities Management Information System (DCAMIS)—DoD’s single, approved
automated database system used by all DoD Components to track the execution of streamlined and
standard competitions. A record for each streamlined and standard competition is assigned a DCAMIS
unique tracking number. The DCAMIS record identifies public-private competition-related data, tracks
the public-private competition’s events as they occur (real-time) from the public announcement (start
date) through the end of the last performance period or cancellation of the public-private competition, and
retains historical records of streamlined and standard competitions after the last performance period has
been completed. DoD’s Competitive Sourcing Program develops reports using DCAMIS data. DCAMIS
can be found at https://www.dcamis.army.mil/ along with the DCAMIS A-76 User’s Guide located on
the Main Menu.
Depot Maintenance Activities—Depot-level maintenance serves to support lower echelons of
maintenance by providing technical assistance and performing that maintenance beyond their
responsibility. Depot maintenance encompasses material maintenance requiring major overhaul or
complete rebuilding of parts, assemblies, subassemblies, and end items, including the manufacture of
parts, modifications, testing, and reclamation as required.
Depreciation—The decline in the value of a capital asset. Depreciation represents a cost of ownership
and the consumption of an asset’s useful life.
Direct Labor—Manpower resources dedicated to performing the requirements of the solicitation and
labor for supervision and management related support to the tender (e.g., MEO) such as labor for quality
control.
Directly Affected Civilian Employees—Civilian employees whose work is being competed in a
streamlined or standard competition.
Directly Affected Government Personnel—Government personnel whose work is being competed in a
streamlined or standard competition.
Directly Interested Party—The agency tender official who submitted the agency tender; a private sector
offeror; or the official who certifies the public reimbursable tender; or a single individual appointed by a
majority of directly affected employees as their agent (the named agent will be of the directly affected
employees).
Divestiture—An agency’s decision to eliminate a government requirement for an AF CA. No service
contract or fee-for-service agreement exists between the agency and the private sector after a divestiture.
By divesting of a CA, an agency elects not to control the activity and cedes ownership and control of the
activity’s associated assets (e.g., equipment, facilities, property) and resources (agency manpower and
budgeting for the activity). The agency has no role in the financial support, management, regulation, or
oversight of a divested activity. Moving, transferring, or converting a CA from government performance
to private sector or public reimbursable performance is not a divestiture.
Employee Transition Plan—A written plan developed by the HRA for the potential transition of the
agency’s civilian employees to an MEO, or to private sector or public reimbursable performance. This
plan is developed early in the streamlined or standard competition process, based on the incumbent
government organization, to identify projected employee impacts and the time needed to accommodate
162                                                                              AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


such impacts, depending on the potential outcomes of the public-private competition. The Employee
Transition Plan differs from a Phase-in Plan, which is developed by prospective providers responding to a
solicitation.
End Date—The end date for a streamlined or standard competition is the date that all SLCF/SCF
certifications are completed, signifying an agency’s performance decision.
Environmental Impact—Analysis Process (EIAP)—Provides procedures for environmental impact
analysis both within the United States and abroad. The EIAP deals primarily with impact analysis under
the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, (Public Law 91-190, 42 U.S.C.
§§4321-4347) and compliance with Executive Order (EO) 12114, Environmental Effects Abroad of
Major Federal Actions.
Environmental—Planning Function (EPF)—The EPF can be the environmental flight within a civilian
engineering squadron, a separate environmental management office at an installation, the CEV at
commands, or an equivalent environmental activity located with a program office.
Execution Year—The current fiscal year.
Expansion—An expansion is the modernization, replacement, upgrading, or the enlargement of an
agency’s AF CA or capability. A public-private competition is not required for expansions prior to
authorizing agency performance. A consolidation of two or more existing commercial activities is not an
expansion, unless the total operating cost is 30 percent greater than the total of the individual components.
Expired MEO—An MEO that has exceeded its performance periods specified in the LOO.
FedBizOpps.gov—The website where the government electronically advertises solicitations or
requirements.
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)—Contracting policy for the Federal government.
Fee-for-Service Agreement—A formal agreement between agencies, in which one agency provides a
service (a CA) for a fee paid by another agency. The agency providing the service is referred to in OMBC
A-76 as a public reimbursable source.
Final Decision—The decision that is implemented following resolution of any type of challenge (e.g.,
contest/ protest) regarding a performance decision or, if no such challenges are received, the time allowed
for submission of challenges. The final decision date is the date when either (a) all certifications are
completed on a streamlined or standard competition form that results from the resolution of challenges, or
(b) if no challenges are received, the time allowed for submission of such challenges.
Firewalls—Firewalls implement conflict of interest rules for a streamlined or standard competition. The
conflict of interest rules serve to separate roles that require neutrality (such as drafting the ground rules of
a public-private competition) from those where advocacy is permissible (such as assisting one side in the
ensuing public-private competition). The PWS Team tasked with developing a PWS to be used for an
A-76 public-private competition is, in effect, setting the ground rules for the public-private competition.
If those who set such ground rules (the PWS Team) later compete under those rules, a conflict of interest
arises. The primary concerns in such situations are that those individuals responsible for establishing the
ground rules may, intentionally or unintentionally, select rules that skew the subsequent public-private
competition in their own favor, and/or will obtain unique and otherwise-unavailable information that
provides an unfair competitive advantage.
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                               163


First Period of Full Performance—The performance period following a phase-in period when the
service provider becomes fully responsible for performing the activity. The first (initial) performance
period is used to implement the new service provider’s Phase-in Plan; therefore, full performance of the
service provider does not occur until the second performance period, which may be referred to as the base
period, full performance, or the first period of full performance. This first period (phase-in) of full
performance may be less than or more than 12 months. The first period of full performance is the second
performance period (the performance period immediately following phase-in period) regardless of the
second performance period’s length.
Financial Plan—The financial plan developed in conjunction with the agency tender and used by the
MEO to structure their cost centers and supply channels for follow-on tracking requirements. This plan
generally involves aligning PECs to RCCCs and EEICs to simplify costing the MEO.
Follow-on Competition (Re-competition)—Completion of another streamlined or standard competition
by the end of the last performance period for an agency or public reimbursable performance decision.
Foreign National Employee—An employee that is not a United States citizen who is employed by the
United States Government and works outside the United States, its territories or possessions, under a
system in which an Executive Agency is the official employer of the foreign national employee and
assumes responsibility for all administration and management activities associated with the employee’s
employment.
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)—The staffing of Federal civilian employee positions, expressed in terms
of annual productive work hours (1,776) rather than annual available hours that includes nonproductive
hours (2,080 hours). FTEs may reflect civilian positions that are not necessarily staffed at the time of
public announcement and staffing of FTE positions may fluctuate during a streamlined or standard
competition. The staffing and threshold FTE requirements stated in OMBC A-76 reflect the workload
performed by these FTE positions, not the workload performed by actual government personnel. FTEs do
not include military personnel, uniformed services, or contract support.
Function Code—The numerical code used to categorize an agency’s commercial and inherently
governmental activities for inventory reporting purposes.
Functional Representatives—Someone representing the activity under competition who may or may not
be considered a technical expert.
Government Furnished Property (GFP)—Facilities, equipment, material, supplies, or other services
provided by the government for use by all prospective providers in the solicitation. Costs for GFP
included in a solicitation are considered common costs. Replacement costs, insurance, maintenance and
repair costs for GFP may or may not be government furnished, depending on the provisions in the
solicitation.
Government Personnel—Civilian employees, foreign national employees, temporary employees, term
employees, non-appropriated fund employees, and uniformed services personnel employed by an agency
to perform activities.
Grouping—Determining appropriate configuration of activities as business units consistent with market
and industry structures.
High Performing Organization (HPO)—A high performing organization is one that; sustains
credibility and customer satisfaction, is resilient and flexible, and supports technology management.
164                                                                             AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


Human Resource Advisor (HRA)—An inherently governmental agency official who is a human
resource expert and is responsible for performing human resource-related actions to assist the ATO in
developing the agency tender.
Human Resource Officer (HRO)—The civilian personnel office responsible for NAF employees.
Incumbent Service Provider—The source (i.e., agency, private sector, or public reimbursable source)
providing the service when a public announcement is made of the streamlined or standard competition.
In-House Performance—Performance of a commercial or inherently governmental activity with
government personnel. Often referred to as “agency performance.”
Information Technology—Any equipment or interconnected system(s) or subsystem(s) of equipment
used in the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display,
switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the agency. For purposes of
this definition, equipment is used by an agency if the equipment is used directly by the agency, or is used
by a private sector contractor under a contract with the agency that requires (1) its use or (2) to a
significant extent, its use in the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product. The term
"information technology" includes computers, ancillary equipment, software, firmware and similar
procedures, services (including support services), and related resources, and does not include any
equipment that is acquired by a private sector contractor incidental to a contract; or contains imbedded
information technology that is used as an integral part of the product, but the principal activity of which is
not the acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching,
interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information. For example, heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning equipment, such as thermostats or temperature control devices, and medical equipment
where information technology is integral to its operation, are not information technology.
Inherently Governmental Activities—An activity that is so intimately related to the public interest as to
mandate performance by government personnel as provided by Chapter 2 and Attachment 2. These
activities require the exercise of discretion in applying government authority, the use of value judgment in
making decisions on behalf of the government, or obligation of funds/entitlements.
Initiative—A streamlined or standard competition approved by AF/A1M. Prior to approval a
public-private competition is known as a candidate.
Installation—An installation is the grouping of facilities, collocated in the same vicinity that supports
particular activities. Commands collocated and supported by another command’s installation are
considered to be tenants.
Interested Parties—For purposes of challenging the contents of an agency’s commercial activities
inventory pursuant to the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act, an interested party is (1) a private
sector source that is an actual or prospective offeror for a contract or other form of agreement to perform
the activity and has a direct economic interest in performing the activity that would be adversely affected
by a determination not to procure the performance of the activity from a private sector source; (2) a
representative of any business or professional association that includes within its membership private
sector sources referred to in (1) above; (3) an officer or employee of an organization within an executive
agency that is an actual or prospective offeror to perform the activity; (4) the head of any labor
organization referred to in section 7103(a)(4) of 5 U.S.C. 2105, that includes within its membership
officers or employees of an organization referred to in paragraph (3) above.
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                     165


Inventory—A list of government personnel, by location, function, and position, performing either
commercial activities or inherently governmental activities.
Letter of Obligation (LOO) Administration—LOO administration is an inherently governmental
activity. LOO administration includes activities performed by the MEO Responsible Official and
Multi-Functional Team who evaluate MEO performance and cost.
Labor Market Research—Assessment of the availability or capability to recruit (including recruiting
cost) personnel in the local labor market to determine if there is an appropriate workforce pool.
Market Research/Analysis—Market research followed by an analysis of at least four comparable
contracts, performed by the Contracting Officer, to determine an estimated range of contract prices. Also
used to determine if commercial sources exist and to determine if a contract option that is exercised,
results in fair and reasonable prices.
MEO Chief—The MEO’s internal project manager responsible for overall MEO performance. Identified
in the LOO and is a member of the multi-functional team. The MEO Chief should be geographically
located with the MEO and reports to the MEO responsible official for all actions and issues concerning
the performance of the MEO.
MEO Letter of Obligation (LOO)—A formal agreement implemented when a streamlined or standard
competition results in agency performance. The CO issues the LOO which is signed by the MEO
Responsible Official.
MEO Responsible Official—An agency official who is deemed to be in the best position to oversee and
be responsible for the performance of the in-house organization.
MEO Subcontracts—Contracts between an agency and the private sector included in the agency tender
or fee-for service agreements with a public reimbursable source included in the agency tender. In addition
to the cost of existing MEO subcontracts, agency or public reimbursable cost estimates must include
support costs associated with existing MEO subcontracts such as government furnished property, and
contract administration, inspection, and surveillance.
Military Essentiality—Positions that directly contribute to prosecution of war (combat or direct combat
support), exercise Uniform Code of Military Justice authority, are required by law, are military due to
custom or tradition, are needed for overseas rotations, or require a skill not available in civilian resources.
Other workloads are not military essential and should be performed by in-service civilians or contract
services.
Military Personnel—Officers [as defined in 10 U.S.C. § 101(b)(1)] and enlisted members [as defined in
10 U.S.C. § 101(b)(6)] of the military services (defined as the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps).
Most Efficient Organization (MEO)—The government’s staffing plan of the agency tender, developed
to represent the agency’s most efficient and cost-effective organization for public-private competition
IAW this instruction, OMBC A-76 and 10 U.S.C. 2461. A streamlined competition resulting in an agency
win is considered an MEO at performance decision and will be coded and treated as an MEO. An MEO
is required for a standard competition and may include a mix of civilian employees and existing MEO
subcontracts. An MEO must be developed for a public-private competition with 10 or more DoD civilian
employee authorizations, IAW Section 8013 of the Defense Appropriation Act for FY 2007 (or successor
provisions in annual statutes).
166                                                                          AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


Multi-function Competition—A multi-function competition may include [1] authorizations for more
than one DoD Function (e.g., base operating support (BOS)) at one installation) or [2] one DoD Function
assigned to more than one installation/location (e.g., refuse collection across a command).
Multi-Functional Team (MFT)—The MFT will be chaired by a Commander or equivalent (may
delegate) at the proper level for oversight of the MEO. Team members should include: Commander (or
designee) as the chair, MEO Responsible Official (may be the commander), MEO Chief, Contracting
Representative (in an advisory role), Financial Management Representative, Civilian Personnel
Representative, servicing Manpower and Organization activity, Quality Assurance (QA) personnel, and
others as deemed necessary. The MFT will convene (at a minimum) at the end of each performance
period to certify the MEO for exercising the next option year.
New Requirement—An agency’s newly established need for a commercial product or service that is not
performed by (1) the agency with government personnel; (2) a fee-for-service agreement with a public
reimbursable source; or (3) a contract with the private sector. An activity that is performed by the agency
and is reengineered, reorganized, modernized, upgraded, expanded, or changed to become more efficient,
but still essentially provides the same service, is not considered a new requirement. New ways of
performing existing work are not new requirements.
No Satisfactory Source—Rationale for retaining positions in-house because no satisfactory commercial
source is capable or available of providing the service. Before concluding there is no satisfactory
commercial source available, the commander will make all reasonable efforts to identify satisfactory
commercial sources IAW the FAR. When the availability of potential sources is uncertain, a synopsis
IAW FAR, Subpart 5.205(e) must be submitted up to three times in a 90 day period with a minimum of 30
days between notices (but, when necessary to meet an urgent requirement, this notification may be limited
to a total of two notices in a 30 day period with a minimum of 15 days between them). Written AF/A1M
approval is required to use this rationale for retaining positions in-house.
Offer—A proposal or bid submitted by any party (i.e., agency tender, private sector source, public
reimbursable tender) in response to a solicitation.
Offeror—Refers to a specific source providing an offer, rather than the response (offer).
Overhead—Overhead includes two major categories of cost, operations overhead and general and
administrative overhead. Operations overhead includes costs that are not 100 percent attributable to the
activity being competed but are generally associated with the recurring management or support of the
activity. General and administrative overhead includes salaries, equipment, space, and other tasks related
to headquarters management, accounting, personnel, legal support, data processing management, and
similar common services performed external to the activity, but in support of the activity being competed.
A standard twelve percent overhead factor is an estimated federal agency overhead factor that is
calculated in agency and public reimbursable cost estimates for streamlined and standard competitions.
Past Performance—An indicator that may be used in the source selection process to evaluate a
prospective provider’s previous performance on work comparable to that being competed, for the purpose
of predicting the quality of future performance relative to other offers or public reimbursable tenders.
FAR, Subpart 42.1501 describes the information used to evaluate past performance, and FAR, Subpart
15.305(a)(2) provides guidance for the consideration of past performance in the source selection process.
Pay Categories of Cost—Costs in a cost estimate associated with the payroll for government personnel,
including inflation.
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                  167


Performance Decision—The decision that identifies the end and outcome of the public-private
competition process. A performance decision occurs prior to resolution of any type of challenge (e.g.,
contests/protests) regarding the performance decision or, if no such challenges are received, the time
allowed for submission of challenges. The performance decision date is the official end date for a
streamlined or standard competition, which occurs when all certifications are completed on the
streamlined or standard competition form signifying a performance decision. The performance decision
date is also the end date for the time frames specified under Section 8021 of the Department of Defense
Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (Public Law Number 109-148) (including recurrences of this
section in DoD Appropriations Acts in subsequent fiscal years).
Performance Plan—Prescribes the objective in having the services, the goals of the multi-functional
team, team members and their roles and responsibilities (to include the private sector contractor
performing the service), and how the multi-functional team will assess service provider performance and
manage the contract to obtain efficiencies, improved performance, and cost savings throughout its life
cycle. A Performance Plan incorporates what use to be referred to as a Quality Assurance Surveillance
Plan (QASP).
Performance Standards—Verifiable, measurable levels of service in terms of quantity, quality,
timeliness, location, and work units. Performance standards are used in a Performance-based Work
Statement (PWS) to (1) assess (i.e., inspect and accept) the work during a period of performance; (2)
provide a common output-related basis for preparing private sector offers and public tenders; and (3)
compare the offers and tenders to the PWS. The requiring activity’s acceptable levels of service are
normally stated in the PWS. The solicitation includes performance standards.
Performance-based Work Statement (PWS)—A statement in the solicitation that identifies the
technical, functional, and performance characteristics of the agency’s requirements. The PWS is
performance-based and describes the agency’s needs (the “what”), not specific methods for meeting those
needs (the “how”). The PWS identifies essential services (outcomes) to be achieved and specifies the
agency’s required performance standards, and the location, units, quality and timeliness of the work. The
PWS serves as the scope of work, and is the basis for all costs entered in COMPARE resulting in the
SLCF/SCF.
Personal Services Contract—A contract that establishes an employer-employee relationship (personal
services) between the Government and private sector employees as described in FAR, Subpart 37.104. A
personal services contract is when Government personnel provide day-to-day instruction/supervision to
private sector employees rather than these employees receiving instructions/supervision from the private
sector contractor. Personal services contracts require special approval from SECAF. Government
personnel directly tasking private sector employees run the risk of causing legal ratification of the action
against which the private sector contractor can file a claim against the Government. This also puts the AF
at risk of violating the Anti-Deficiency Act.
Phase-in Plan—A prospective provider’s written plan to replace the incumbent provider(s) that is
submitted in response to the solicitation. The Phase-in Plan is implemented in the first performance
period and includes details on minimizing disruption, adverse personnel impacts, and start-up
requirements. The Phase-in Plan is different from the employee transition plan developed by the HRA.
Position Description—An official record of major duties and responsibilities assigned to a position and
can be represented several way, to include; position description (PD), standard position description
(SPD), standard core personnel document (SCPD), or core personnel document (CPD).
168                                                                           AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


Post Competition Accountability—After the public-private competition decision, the performance must
be monitored, tracked, and reported (to include estimated and actual cost) to determine if required
services are being delivered within the requirements of the contract (private sector), Letter of Obligation
(in-house) or MOA/MOU (public reimbursable tender).
Preliminary Planning Process (P3)—The process of determining whether competitive sourcing is the
optimal methodology for sourcing an organization(s) by ensuring factors that impact competitive
sourcing (i.e., wartime requirements, workforce availability, commercial viability, career-field
sustainability, and workload documentations) are reviewed prior to a sourcing decision.
Preliminary Planning Project Manager—Individual with overall responsibility for managing the
preliminary planning project.
Private Sector Source—Any business or other non-Federal activity that is eligible for contract award
IAW Federal Acquisition Regulations.
Privatization—A federal agency decision to change a government-owned and government-operated or
enterprise to private sector control and ownership. When privatizing, the agency eliminates associated
assets and resources (manpower for and funding of the requirement). Since there is no government
ownership and control, no service contract or fee-for-service agreement exists between the agency and the
private sector after an agency privatizes a CA or enterprise. Moving work from agency performance with
government personnel to private sector performance where the agency still funds the activity is not
privatization.
Procurement Integrity Act—The Procurement Integrity Act, officially known as Section 27 of the
Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, is codified by 41 U.S.C. 423 and implemented in FAR, Subpart
3.1. The procurement integrity statute and regulations establish prohibitions, restrictions, and
requirements relative to disclosing or obtaining source selection sensitive information and reporting
employment contacts and post-Government employment.
Program Element Code (PEC)—A combination of manpower, equipment, and facilities related to a
mission capability or activity. The PEC is the basic building block of the FYDP.
Program Objective Memorandum (POM)—E a c h s e r v i c e s u b m i t s t h e P r o g r a m O b j e c t i v e
Memorandum to SECDEF biannually. It is the services and defense agency’s total program requirements
for the next six years and includes rationale for planned changes from the approved FYDP baseline within
the Fiscal Guidance.
Project Manager—Individual responsible for planning, organizing, leading, and controlling the project.
Proposal—An offer made in response to a Request for Proposals in a negotiated acquisition.
Prospective Providers—Private sector, public reimbursable, and agency sources that may submit
responses (offers or tenders) to an agency’s solicitation.
Protests—See Contest
Provider—An agency, private sector, or public reimbursable source that is performing, or will perform,
an AF CA; sometimes referred to as a service provider.
Public Announcement—An agency’s formal declaration the agency has made a (1) decision to perform
a streamlined or standard competition, or (2) performance decision and final decision in a streamlined or
standard competition. The wing/installation/activity commander makes public announcement to all
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                  169


directly affected government personnel (and representatives), before or at the same time, as the
Contracting Officer posts the announcement to FedBizOpps.gov.
Public-Private Competition—A formal evaluation of sources to provide a CA that uses pre-established
rules (e.g., the FAR and OMBC A-76). Public-private competitions between private sector sources are
performed IAW the FAR. Public-private competitions between agency, private sector, and public
reimbursable sources are performed IAW the FAR, OMBC A-76 and this instruction. The terms
“public-private competition” and “competition” as used in OMBC A-76 circular and this AFI include
streamlined and standard competitions performed IAW OMBC A-76, and FAR-based competitions for
agency-performed activities, contracted services, new requirements, expansions of existing work, and
activities performed under fee-for-service agreement. The term also includes cost comparisons,
streamlined cost comparisons, and direct conversions performed under previous versions of OMBC A-76.
Public-Private Competition File—The documents used in a public-private competition in addition to
the government public-private competition files required by FAR, Subpart 4.8. Agencies maintain this
file, IAW AF RDS and 10 U.S.C. 2463, regardless of the source selected to perform the activity.
Public Reimbursable Source—A service provider from a federal agency that could perform an AF CA
for another federal agency on a fee-for-service or reimbursable basis by using either civilian employees or
federal contracts with the private sector.
Public Reimbursable Tender—A federal agency’s formal response to another federal agency’s
solicitation for offers or tenders. The public reimbursable tender is developed identical to an Agency
Tender and includes a cost estimate prepared IAW the DoD Costing Manual and more current OMB,
DoD, and AF guidance.
PWS Team—A group of individuals, comprised of technical and functional experts, formed to develop
the PWS and Performance Plan and to assist the Contracting Officer in developing the solicitation.
Qualified Adjustment Request—(QAR)—A deliberate method used to identify and standardize the
mission and workload change request process. A QAR must identify, at a minimum, the workload
increase, the workload driver, and the source of funding.
Quality Assurance (QA) Personnel—Individual(s) designated to perform quality assessment activities
and manage performance IAW the Performance Plan. They serve as on-site technical managers assessing
contractor performance against contract performance standards. Personnel in this area have many titles,
such as Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE), Quality Assurance Specialist (QAS), and Contracting
Officer Technical Representative (COTR); however, their duties are essentially the same. Primarily
allocate civilian authorizations for QA personnel positions. Military will not be allocated for full-time
QA personnel responsibilities since these activities are not military essential; however, they may perform
QA personnel responsibilities as an additional duty.
Quality Control Plan (QCP)—A Self-Inspection Plan that is included in all offers and tenders. The
Quality Control Plan describes the internal staffing and procedures that the prospective provider will use
to meet the quality, quantity, timeliness, responsiveness, customer satisfaction, and other service delivery
requirements in the PWS.
Reason Source Code—Specific codes used to indicate the rationale for government performance of a
commercial activity which may be found on the MPES website in the reference Table under “Tools”.
These codes are referred to as IGCA reason, IGCA reason source codes (RSC), and as RSN codes.
170                                                                            AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008


Representatives of Directly Affected Employees—In the case of directly affected employees
represented by a labor organization accorded exclusive recognition under 5 U.S.C. § 7111, a
representative is an individual designated by that labor organization to represent its interests. In the case
of directly affected employees not represented by a labor organization under 5 U.S.C. § 7111, a
representative is an individual appointed by directly affected employees as their representative.
Request for Proposal (RFP)—The request to potential offerors to submit proposals using the negotiated
acquisition process.
Residual Value—The estimated value of a capital asset at the end of its useful life as determined by

agency requirements.
Resource Allocation Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS)—A                     personal
computer-based software tool used by all AF programmers to create options for presentation to senior
leadership and create electronic data files for transmittal to Automated Budget Interactive Data
Environment System (ABIDES) data systems. RAPIDS has three modules with Workstation and
Decision Tracker being the key applications. The Workstation module is used to create funding level
detail data. The Decision Tracker module is used to display options and track decisions made by senior
leadership through the Air Force Corporate Structure.
Right of First Refusal—Private sector contractors provide all displaced DoD civilian and NAF
employees (except temporary employees hired subsequent to the public-private competition
announcement) the right of first refusal for employment openings under the contract in positions for
which they qualify. Employment must be consistent with post-government employment conflict of
interest standards.
Sealed Bidding—A method of contracting that employs public opening of bids and awards to the
responsive bidder considering only price and price-related factors included in the solicitation.
Segregable Expansion—Increase(s) to an existing commercial activity that can be separately competed.
Service Identification—In preliminary planning, service identification establishes the services
(outcomes/products) currently being accomplished. In an A-76 public-private competition, service
identification establishes those services included in the solicitation and required to be performed by the
any service provider (agency tender, private sector, or public reimbursable).
Service Provider—An agency, private sector, or public reimbursable source that is performing, or will
perform, an AF CA; sometimes referred to as a provider.
SHARE A-76!—The Department of Defense A-76 knowledge management system used to share
knowledge, information, and experience about public-private competitions. This public site contains
A-76-related guidance, sample documents, best practices, tools, and links to other A-76 websites and
sources for A-76-related information. Users may post best practices used in public-private competitions,
research A-76 through the use of search engines, and submit internet links to add to the available links in
SHARE A-76!
Solicitation—Any request to submit offers or quotations to the government. Solicitations under sealed
bid procedures are called “invitations for bid.” Solicitations under negotiated procedures are called
“requests for proposals.”

Solicitation Closing Date—The due date for delivery of private sector offers, public reimbursable
tenders, and the agency tender as stated in the solicitation.
Source—One of three specific categories of service providers (i.e., agency, private sector, or public
reimbursable) that can perform a CA for an agency.
Source Selection Authority (SSA)—A competition official with decision-making authority who is
responsible for source selection as required by the FAR and OMBC A-76. The SSA and Contracting
Officer may be the same individual.
Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB)—The team appointed by the SSA to assist in a negotiated
acquisition.
Source Selection Information Briefing and Debriefing Certificates—A certification acknowledging
persons involved/or accessing source selection or proprietary information, during a source selection and
after the performance decision, that could damage the integrity of the procurement by transmitting or

of the individuals under the Procurement Integrity Laws or other applicable laws.
Standard Competition Form (SCF)—The agency form that documents and certifies all costs calculated
in the standard competition.
Start Date.—The start date for a streamlined or standard competition is the date that the agency makes a
formal public announcement of the agency’s decision to perform a streamlined or standard competition.
Streamlined Competition Form (SLCF)—The agency form that documents and certifies all costs
calculated in the streamlined competition.
Technical Expert—Someone with vast knowledge of all aspects of the type of activity under
competition. This individual may or may not be a current member of the activity under competition as
this individual may be from the MAJCOM, Air Staff, or even another installation. Technical experts,
assigned to a specific A-76 team, may provide technical expertise (answer a specific question on existing
processes, or provide specific data to a member of another A-76 team) across team lines; however, these
individuals must separate their role requiring neutrality (confidential information with the potential to
affect the outcome of the competition) from their role as a technical expert (individual with vast
knowledge of the function under competition). Technical expert and functional are used interchangeably
in this instruction.
Uniformed Services—Members of the armed forces (i.e., Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and
Coast Guard) and other uniformed services (e.g., National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and
Public Health Service).
Useful Life—The estimated period of economic usefulness of a capital asset.
Wing/Installation/Activity Commander—The commanding officer or head of an installation or a tenant
activity who has budget and supervisory control over resources and personnel.

                                                Attachment 2

                     SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDELINES FOR IDENTIFYING AN
                         INHERENTLY GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITY


1. Guidelines. If an activity proposed for potential contract performance is not found in Appendix A of
this attachment, the following guidelines will assist agencies in determining whether the activity is, as a
matter of policy, inherently governmental.


1.1. Totality of the circumstances. Determining whether an activity is an inherently governmental
activity often is difficult and depends upon an analysis of the factors of the case. Such analysis involves
consideration of a number of factors, and the presence or absence of any one factor is not in itself deter-
minative of the issue. Nor will the same emphasis necessarily be placed on any one factor at different
times, due to the changing nature of the Government's requirements. The following factors should be
considered when deciding whether award of a contract might effect, or the performance of a contract has
affected, a transfer of official responsibility:


1.1.1. Congressional legislative restrictions or authorizations.


1.1.2. The private sector contractor's ability to take action that will significantly and directly affect the
life, liberty, or property of individual members of the public, including the likelihood of the private sector
contractor's need to resort to force in support of a military, police, or judicial activity; whether force, espe-
cially deadly force, is more likely to be initiated by the private sector contractor or by some other person;
and the degree to which force may have to be exercised in public or relatively uncontrolled areas.
(NOTE: Contracting for guard, convoy security, and plant protection services, armed or unarmed, are
considered as commercial activities and are not considered inherently governmental, as prescribed in
OMB Circular A-76 Attachment A. Access control, perimeter control, physical security, and monitor-
ing of detection devices are commercial activities integral to security guard activities that are subject to
the prohibitions of 10 U.S.C. 2465 that bar contracting by DoD activities.)


1.1.3. The availability of special agency authorities and the appropriateness of their application to the sit-
uation at hand, such as the power to deputize private persons. Law enforcement is inherently governmen-
tal, including arrest, search, seizure, serving of warrants, ticketing for law breaking, custodial
interrogation,


1.1.4. Whether the activity in question is already being performed by private persons and the circum-
stances under which it is being performed by them.


1.1.5. The degree to which official discretion is or would be limited, i.e., whether the private sector con-
tractor's involvement in agency activities is or would be so extensive or his or her work product is so far
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                     173


advanced toward completion that the agency's ability to develop and consider options other than those
provided by the private sector contractor is restricted.


1.1.6. In claims adjudication and related services,
1.1.6.1. The finality of any private sector contractor's action affecting individual claimants or applicants,
and whether or not review of the private sector contractor's action is de novo (i.e., to be effected without
the appellate body's being bound by prior legal rulings or factual determinations) on appeal of his or her
decision to an agency official;
1.1.6.2. the degree to which private sector contractor activities may involve wide-ranging interpretations
of complex, ambiguous case law and other legal authorities, as opposed to being circumscribed by
detailed laws, regulations, and procedures;


1.1.6.3. the degree to which matters for decision by the private sector contractor involve recurring fact
patterns or unique fact patterns; and


1.1.6.4. the private sector contractor's discretion to determine an appropriate award or penalty.


2. Mission-essential services. Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 3020.37, Continuation of
Essential DoD Contractor Services During Crises, 6 Nov 1990, requires commanders to determine which
services performed by private sector contractors during peacetime are essential to continue being per-
formed in the event of an emergency. Emergencies may include natural disasters and civil response, as
well as combat, contingency, and humanitarian operations. Commanders must include in contingency
operation plans the ability to obtain essential services if private sector contractors cannot or will not per-
form in an emergency. Some logistics and other support are so essential to the success of a military mis-
sion that nonperformance will result in mission failure. Such services should be considered inherently
governmental.


2.1. The exercise of discretion. While inherently governmental activities necessarily involve the exer-
cise of substantial discretion, not every exercise of discretion is evidence that such an activity is involved.
Rather, the use of discretion must have the effect of committing the Federal Government to a course of
action when two or more alternative courses of action exist (e.g., purchasing a mini-computer rather than
a mainframe computer, hiring a statistician rather than an economist, and supporting proposed legislation
rather than opposing it). A contract may thus properly be awarded where the private sector contractor
does not have the authority to decide on the course of action to be pursued but is rather tasked to develop
options to inform an agency decision maker, or to develop or expand decisions already made by Federal
officials. Moreover, the mere fact that decisions are made by the private sector contractors in performing
his or her duties (e.g., how to allocate the private sector contractor's own or subcontract resources, what
techniques and procedures to employ, whether and whom to consult, what research alternatives to explore
given the scope of the contract, what conclusions to emphasize, and how frequently to test) is not determi-
native of whether he or she is performing an inherently government activity.
174                                                                            AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008



2.2. Exercise of approving or signature authority. Official responsibility to approve the work of pri-
vate sector contractors is a power reserved to Government officials. It should be exercised with a thorough
knowledge and understanding of the contents of documents submitted by private sector contractors and a
recognition of the need to apply independent judgment in the use of these work products.


2.3. Amount of oversight. The extent of reliance on private sector service contractors is not by itself a
cause for concern. Agencies must, however, have a sufficient number of trained and experienced staff to
manage Government programs properly. The greater the degree of reliance on private sector contractors,
the greater the need for oversight by agencies. What number of Government officials is needed to oversee
a particular contract is a management decision to be made after analysis of a number of factors. These fac-
tors include, among others, the following: the scope of the activity in question; the technical complexity
of the project or its components; the technical capability, numbers, and workload of Federal oversight
officials; the inspection techniques available; and the importance of the activity. Current contract admin-
istration resources will not be determinative. The most efficient and cost effective approach will be uti-
lized.


2.4. Identification of private sector contractor personnel and acknowledgment of contractor partic-
ipation. Private sector contractor personnel attending meetings, answering Government telephones, and
working in other situations where their private sector contractor status is not obvious to third parties must
be required to identify themselves as such to avoid creating an impression in the minds of members of the
public or the Congress that they are Government officials, unless, in the judgment of the agency, no harm
can come from failing to identify themselves. All documents or reports produced by private sector con-
tractors are to be suitably marked as private sector contractor products.


3. Accountability. It is the policy of the Executive Branch to ensure that Government action is taken as
a result of informed, independent judgments made by Government officials who are ultimately account-
able to the President. When the Government uses service contracts, such informed, independent judgment
is ensured by providing greater scrutiny and an appropriate enhanced degree of management oversight
when contracting for activities that are not inherently governmental but closely support the performance
of inherently governmental activities (see Appendix B).

2A.1. In addition to the list in FAR, Subpart 7.5, which has been adopted by FY2006 National Defense
Authorization Act, the following is an illustrative list of activities considered to be inherently governmen-
tal activities that will not be contracted:

bers of the combat, combat support or combat service support role.


2A.1.4. Combat, combat support, logistics support, or other services essential to mission success or
needed for continuity of operations during a mobilization, war, or other crisis situation and the work
requires military-unique knowledge and skills. This includes any activity that is likely to be the actual
(material and substantial) and the proximate (legal and foreseeable) cause of injury to the armed forces of
another Government in an international armed conflict.


2A.1.5. The conduct of foreign relations and the determination of foreign policy.

tive plans, and evaluation criteria;
2A.1.13.3. Awarding contracts, issuing task orders, or in any way binding the Government;
2A.1.13.4. Administering contracts (including ordering changes in contract performance or contract
quantities, taking action based on evaluations of private sector contractor performance, and accepting or
rejecting private sector contractor products or services);
2A.1.13.5. Terminating contracts; and


2A.1.13.6. Determining whether contract costs are reasonable, allocable, and allowable.


2A.1.14. The approval of agency responses to Freedom of Information Act requests (other than routine

                                      Attachment 2, APPENDIX B


2B.1. The following list is of services and actions that are not considered to be inherently governmental
activities. However, they may approach being in that category because of the way in which the private
sector contractor performs the contract or the manner in which the Government administers private sector
contractor performance. Contracting is usually inappropriate when these types of services require Gov-
ernment supervision, primary obligation or loyalty to the Government, or codes of professional responsi-
bility that recognize the agency as the “client.” When contracting for services like these, agencies should
carefully scrutinize the terms of the contract, contractor performance, and contract administration to
ensure that appropriate agency control is preserved. See also, the list in FAR, Subpart 7.5.


2B.2. This is an illustrative listing, and is not intended to promote or discourage the use of the following
types of private sector contractor services:


2B.2.1. Services that involve or relate to budget preparation, including workload modeling, fact finding,
efficiency studies, and should-cost analyses, etc.


2B.2.2. Services that involve or relate to reorganization and planning activities.


2B.2.3. Services that involve or relate to analyses, feasibility studies, and strategy options to be used by
agency personnel in developing policy.


2B.2.4. Services that involve or relate to the development of regulations.


2B.2.5. Services that involve or relate to the evaluation of another private sector contractor's perfor-
mance.


2B.2.6. Services in support of acquisition planning.


2B.2.7. Assistance in contract management (such as where the private sector contractor might influence
official evaluations of other private sector contractors).


2B.2.8. Technical evaluation of contract proposals.


2B.2.9. Assistance in the development of Statements of Work.
AFI38-203 20 JUNE 2008                                                                                   179


2B.2.10. Support in preparing responses to Freedom of Information Act requests.


2B.2.11. Any situation that permits or might permit private sector contractors to gain access to confiden-
tial business information and/or any other sensitive information (other than situations covered by the
Defense Industrial Security Program described in FAR, Subpart 4.402(b)).


2B.2.12. The providing of information regarding agency policies or regulations, such as attending confer-
ences on behalf of an agency, conducting community relations campaigns, or conducting agency training
courses.


2B.2.13. Participating in any situation where it might be assumed that the personnel are agency employ-
ees or representatives.


2B.2.14. Participating as technical advisors to a source selection board or participating as nonvoting
members of a source evaluation board.


2B.2.15. Serving as arbitrators or providing alternative methods of dispute resolution.


2B.2.16. Constructing buildings or structures intended to be secure from electronic eavesdropping or
other penetration by foreign governments.


2B.2.17. Inspection services.


2B.2.18. Interpretation of regulations and statutes.


2B.2.19. Special non-law enforcement, security activities that do not directly involve criminal investiga-
tions, such as prisoner detention or transport and nonmilitary national security details.


2B.2.20. Essential services that must be continued during an emergency, crisis, or contingency. (See
DoDI 3020.37 for required contingency planning.) During times that are not an emergency, crisis, or con-
tingency, these services may be contracted, but ordinarily arrangements will be made (and funded) to train
military and DoD civilians to perform the services should the need arise.
