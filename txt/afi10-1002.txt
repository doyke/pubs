★SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This revision incorporates adds new policy on foreign soil and temporary agreements (paragraphs 1 and 4 ); incorpates and
reecorganizes requirements, information, and procedures formerly in AFR 55-20 (paragraph 2); and adds examples of
agreements (attachments 2 and 3).

★1. Joint-Use Agreements. An agreement between the Air Force and a local government agency is required before a
community can establish a public airport on an Air Force airfield.
1.1. Joint use of an Air Force airfield will be considered only if there will be no cost to the Air Force and no compromise of
mission capability, security, readiness, safety, or quality of life. Further, only proposals submitted by authorized
representatives of local government agencies eligible to sponsor a public airport will be given the comprehensive evaluation
required to conclude a joint use agreement. All reviewing levels will consider and evaluate such requests on an individual
basis.
1.2. Generally, the Air Force is willing to consider joint use at an airfield if it does not have pilot training, nuclear storage,
or a primary mission that requires a high level of security. Civil operations must begin within 5 years of the effective date
of an agreement. Operational considerations will be based on the premise that military aircraft will receive priority
handling (except in emergencies), if traffic must be adjusted or resequenced. The Air Force normally will not consider
personnel increases solely to support civil operations but, if accommodated, all costs must be fully reimbursed by the joint-
use sponsor. The Air Force will not provide personnel to install, operate, maintain, alter, or relocate navigation equipment
or aircraft arresting systems for the sole use of civil aviation. Changes in equipment or systems to support the civil
operations must be funded by the joint-use sponsor. The Air Force must approve siting, design, and construction of the civil
facilities.

2. Procedures for Sponsor. To initiate consideration for joint use of an Air Force airfield, a formal proposal must be
submitted to the installation commander by a local government agency eligible to sponsor a public airport. The proposal
must include:
    • Type of operation.
    • Type and number of aircraft to be located on or operating at the airfield.
    • An estimate of the number of annual operations for the first 5 years.

★3. Air Force Procedures:
3.1. Upon receipt of a joint-use proposal, the installation commander, without precommitment or comment, will send the
documents to the Air Force Representative (AFREP) at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Regional Office within
the geographical area where the installation is located. AFI 13-201, Air Force Airspace Management, lists the AFREPs
and their addresses. The installation commander must provide an information copy of the proposal to HQ USAF/XOOBC,
1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1480.

3.2. The AFREP provides comments to the installation                    or surplus Federal real property and an
commander on airspace, air traffic control, and other                   application submitted through FAA for an airport

                                            THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE

          This Joint Use Agreement is made and entered into this               day of
                       19__, by and between the Secretary of the Air Force, for and on behalf of the United States of America
("Air Force") and an airport sponsor ("Sponsor"), a public body eligible to sponsor a public airport.
          WHEREAS, the Air Force owns and operates the runways and associated flight facilities (collectively "flying
facilities") located at Warbucks Air Force Base, USA ("WAFB"); and
          WHEREAS, Sponsor desires to use the flying facilities at WAFB to permit operations by general aviation aircraft
and commercial air carriers (scheduled and nonscheduled) jointly with military aircraft; and
          WHEREAS, the Air Force considers that this Agreement will be in the public interest, and is agreeable to joint
use of the flying facilities at WAFB; and
          WHEREAS, this Agreement neither addresses nor commits any Air Force real property or other facilities that may
be required for exclusive use by Sponsor to support either present or future civil aviation operations and activities in
connection with joint use; and
          WHEREAS, the real property and other facilities needed to support civil aviation operations are either already
available to or will be diligently pursued by the Sponsor;
          NOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed:
1. JOINT USE

          a. The Air Force hereby authorizes Sponsor to permit aircraft equipped with two-way radios capable of
communicating with the WAFB Control Tower to use the flying facilities at WAFB, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement and those Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) applicable to civil aircraft operations. Civil aircraft
operations are limited to 20,000 per calendar year. An operation is a landing or a takeoff. Civil aircraft using the flying
facilities of WAFB on official Government business as provided in Air Force Instruction
(AFI) 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, are not subject to this Agreement.
           b. Aircraft using the flying facilities of WAFB under the authority granted to Sponsor by this Agreement shall be
entitled to use those for landings, takeoffs, and movement of aircraft and will normally park only in the area made available
to Sponsor and designated by them for that purpose.
           c. Government aircraft taking off and landing at WAFB will have priority over all civil aircraft at all times.
           d. All ground and air movements of civil aircraft using the flying facilities of WAFB under this Agreement, and
movements of all other vehicles across Air Force taxiways, will be controlled by the WAFB Control Tower. Civil aircraft
activity will coincide with the WAFB Control Tower hours of operation. Any additional hours of the WAFB Control Tower
or other essential airfield management, or operational requirements beyond those needed by the Air Force, shall be arranged
and funded (or reimbursed) by Sponsor. These charges, if any, shall be in addition to the annual charge in paragraph 2 and
payable not less frequently than quarterly.
           e. No civil aircraft may use the flying facilities for training.
           f. Air Force-owned airfield pavements made available for use under this Agreement shall be for use on an "as is,
where is" basis. The Air Force will be responsible for snow removal only as required for Government mission
accomplishment.
           g. Dust or any other erosion or nuisance that is created by, or arises out of, activities or operations by civil aircraft
authorized use of the flying facilities under this Agreement will be corrected by Sponsor at no expense to the Air Force,
using standard engineering methods and procedures.
           h. All phases of planning and construction of new runways and primary taxiways on Sponsor property must be
coordinated with the WAFB Base Civil Engineer. Those intended to be jointly used by Air Force aircraft will be designed
to support the type of military aircraft assigned to or commonly transient through WAFB.
           i. Coordination with the WAFB Base Civil Engineer is required for planning and construction of new structures or
exterior alteration of existing structures that are owned or leased by Sponsor.
           j. Sponsor shall comply with the procedural and substantive requirements established by the Air Force, and
Federal, State, interstate, and local laws, for the flying facilities of WAFB and any runway and flight facilities on Sponsor

property with respect to the control of air and water pollution; noise; hazardous and solid waste management and disposal;
and hazardous materials management.
          k. Sponsor shall implement civil aircraft noise mitigation plans and controls at no expense to and as directed by
the Air Force, pursuant to the requirements of the WAFB Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) study; the FAA
Part 150 study; and environmental impact statements and environmental assessments, including supplements, applicable to
aircraft operations at WAFB.
          l. Sponsor shall comply, at no expense to the Air Force, with all applicable FAA security measures and procedures
as described in the Airport Security Program for WAFB.
          m. Sponsor shall not post any notices or erect any billboards or signs, nor authorize the posting of any notices or
the erection of any billboards or signs at the airfield of any nature whatsoever, other than identification signs attached to
buildings, without prior written approval from the WAFB Base Civil Engineer.
          n. Sponsor shall neither transfer nor assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Air Force.
2. PAYMENT
