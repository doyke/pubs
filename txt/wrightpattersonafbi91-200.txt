1. Explosives Limits. The operating location and storage location combined must not exceed
the type and quantity of explosives authorized on the Explosives Facility License (AF Form
2047) and as outlined in the Explosives Site Plan.
2. Personnel Limits. Only trained and qualified personnel will handle, transport, store, and use
GBS and smoke grenades. Personnel limits will be the minimum required for safe and effective
operations. Personnel directly involved in GBS operations will not exceed one supervisor, two
workers, and two casuals.
     2.1. Operations will stop when visitors are present if they are within the explosives safety
     zone (this does not prohibit official visits by Safety, Quality Assurance, Management, or
     Inspection Personnel).
3. Location. When GBS and smoke grenades are required to be stored at the Warfighter
Training Center (WTC), formerly known as the Prime Beef Training Area (PBTA), they will be
stored in WTC bldg 882. All explosives will be handled and detonated at the WTC or designated
exercise location(s) in pre-positioned tire barricade/detonation pits if practical and/or required
based upon munitions type. The detonation pits will be constructed of a tire barricade and be
approximately two to three feet in diameter and at least 24 inches thick. The pits will be
constructed to a “waist height” to not prevent removal of dud GBS and smoke grenades from the
pits by EOD.
     3.1. In the event of unused GBS and smoke grenades, coordination with 88 OSS/OSK will
     be conducted. The unused GBS and smoke grenade units will be returned to the munitions
     storage area (MSA).
