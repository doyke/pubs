SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The revision
incorporates guidance pertaining to the specific AFISRA cradle-to-grave approach to strategic
basing. In addition, this guidance incorporates HQ USAF’s basing strategies with AFISRA’s
processes for the conduct of Site Activation Task Forces (SATAFs), Site Surveys, and the
development and implementation of PPlans/PMsgs, thereby, making AFISRA’s process a
repeatable, defendable, transparent, and flexible one.

                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. There is a continuing Air Force requirement to preserve a basing infrastructure of
land, facilities, and airspace to support its missions, people, weapons systems, and equipment.
The Air Force continues to manage its basing infrastructure to support the scope and level of
operations necessary to carry out its missions worldwide. On its installations, Air Force missions
and units take precedence over those of non-Air Force agencies, and military activities take
precedence over other governmental and nongovernmental activities.
1.2. Purpose of the instruction. This instruction establishes policies and procedures that are in
line with AF Policy Directives and HQ AF instructions on preserving the AF basing
infrastructure. Additionally, the processes outlined in this instruction are tailored to enhance the
Air Force’s unique mission of flying and fighting in the air, space, and cyberspace, as well as the
AFISRA mission of organizing, training, equipping, and presenting assigned forces and
capabilities to conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance for combatant commanders
and the nation.
1.3. Document Distribution. Basing documents are for internal use on a strict ―need-to-know‖
basis (reference DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program Regulation, January 1997, and
AFPD 31-4, Information Security). Access to basing information by industrial firms under
contract to the Air Force should be limited to a strict ―need-to-know‖ basis as provided in DoD
5200.1-R; AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management; DoD 5220.22-R, Industrial
Security Regulations, and AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Program Management. The Under
Secretary of Defense/Comptroller (USD(C)) will consider requests on a case-by-case basis.
1.4. Processing Public Announcements. Public announcements must be processed through
AFISRA/PA. Public announcements will be made only after coordination and/or approval with
SECAF/CSAF. Public announcements for basing decisions require coordination through the
SAF/PA and SAF/LL offices.
   1.4.1. Public Announcements and Site Survey Candidate list. At no time will the ranked
   candidate list or the refined ranked candidate list for site surveys be releasable to the public
   or personnel outside the process for that specific basing action. AFISRA/PA will coordinate
   with SAF/LL and SAF/PA prior to publicly releasing site survey and Environmental Impact
   Analysis Process (EIAP) information.
1.5. Basing Action. AFISRA/A5CB is the clearing house for all AFISRA basing
actions/requests, as outlined in AFI 10-503, Paragraph 1.1.
1.6. National Capital Region (NCR) Basing: As defined in AFI 10-503, Para 1.4., approval
for NCR basing actions/requests will be submitted by AFISRA/A5CB to HAF/A8PB with info to
AF/A2C.
   1.6.1. Requesting NCR Cap Approval. AFISRA will submit all requests for permanent
   space in the NCR to HAF/A8PB with info to AF/A2C.

                                            Chapter 2

                       PROGRAMMING DECISION AUTHORITIES

2.1. Basing. Before discussing the basing process, it is imperative to understand that basing is
the term used for actions taken to position Air Force units (on AF or non-AF property) or non-
USAF entities on USAF real property. The Basing process is used to determine the location of a
unit, manpower, mission, or activity. The Air Force Strategic Basing Process provides an
enterprise-wide repeatable analysis for decision making to ensure all basing actions involving
Air Force units, missions, and/or real property support Air Force mission requirements and
comply with all applicable environmental guidance. The Basing process starts with a basing
need or action that is identified by an official document. Commonly used directive documents
are identified in this chapter.
2.2. Program Action Directive (PAD). A formal planning document used to facilitate and
record the accomplishment of a major action such as the reorganization or formation of a major
command, organization, unit, or function. A PAD is used also to provide program direction on
new acquisitions and modifications. It states the objective, defines a concept of operations,
assigns specific tasks to offices of primary responsibility and offices of collateral responsibility,
and establishes milestones. PADs are generated at the Air Staff level and are used to direct
MAJCOM or other subordinate level development of Programming Plans (PPlans)/Programming
Messages (PMsgs). In some instances, a MAJCOM or subordinate unit may request authority to
write a PAD or be directed to write a PAD by Air Staff, but this is the exception rather than the
rule.
2.3. Program Change Request (PCR). Air Force program actions are authorized by the
President's Budget (PB). Formulation of the PB is a cyclic process. The PCR is a tool,
submitted by a MAJCOM or the Air Staff, which is used to initiate proposed out-of-cycle
changes to programs contained in the PB. For PCR guidance see AFI 16-501, Control and
Documentation of Air Force Programs.
2.4. Organizational Change Request (OCR). An OCR is a request for an organizational
action such as a unit activation, inactivation, redesignation, or variation to a standard structure.
OCRs are normally submitted through AFISRA/A1 to HQ USAF/A1M for approval but are not
required for organizational changes resulting from approved force structure actions. OCRs for
detachments and operating locations are approved at HQ AFISRA. See AFI 38-101, Air Force
Organization, for further guidance regarding OCRs. If the program action involves an
organizational change that is not already reflected in the President's Budget, an OCR must be
submitted to Air Staff, through AFISRA/A1. An OCR takes approximately 120 days for Air
Staff approval. PPlan/PMsg development can begin prior to OCR approval, but no irreversible
actions can be taken until approval is granted.
AFISRAI10-501 21 MARCH 2011                                                                     7


                                           Chapter 3

                      AIR FORCE STRATEGIC BASING PROCESS

3.1. Guidance for the Basing Process. The AFISRA’s basing process is governed by the Air
Force Strategic Basing Structure (AFSBS). The AFSBS is guided by the Air Force Strategic
Plan, Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), CORONA, and other written sources. AFSBS
enables Air Force basing decisions by supporting an enterprise-wide, criteria-based review.
3.2. Air Force Strategic Basing Structure (AFSBS). The AFSBS presents recommended
courses of action to the SECAF and CSAF for making criteria-based decisions. The ultimate
goals of the AFSBS are to provide a multifunctional, cross-staff perspective on all key Air Force
basing decisions, enhance basing issue responsiveness, support interactive corporate decision-
making, and bridge organizational barriers to improve the basing process. The top-down
deliberative elements of the AFSBS are the Strategic Basing – Executive Steering Group (SB-
ESG) and the Basing Request Review Panel (BRRP).
   3.2.1. BRRP. The BRRP is comprised of O-6 and civilian equivalents and provides the SB-
   ESG, as well as senior-level leadership, a forum for initial corporate review and evaluation of
   appropriate issues. The BRRP, chaired by HAF/A8PB, is the first level of the AFSBS basing
   review and decision making process that the AFISRA’s basing requests must meet.
   3.2.2. SB-ESG. SB-ESG is the senior forum of 1 and 2 star general officers and civilian
   equivalents that is chaired by the SAF/IEI, with the HAF/A8P as vice-chair. SB-ESG
   reviews and evaluates Air Force concepts or operations, basing objectives, criteria,
   alternatives, policies, programming, planning, and makes recommendations to the SECAF
   and CSAF. The SB-ESG also returns issues to the BRRP that require additional information
   or work.
3.3. Initiating the Basing Process. After a requirement is identified and it is determined that a
basing action is required, the AFISRA basing process begins (see Attachments 2 & 3). The
AFISRA basing process is the avenue used to approve all basing actions. It is initiated with the
submission of a Basing Action Request (BAR) by AFISRA/A5CB to HAF/A8PB. This may be
exempted by HAF/A8PB during the course of staffing and some basing actions, deemed minor in
nature by HAF/A8PB, may require information-only staffing.
   3.3.1. Framing the Basing Criteria. The BRRP will recommend broad guidance through
   HAF/A8PB to frame the development of basing criteria. AFISRA will use this broad
   guidance and develop specific basing criteria for the required action(s). AFISRA/A5CB will
   submit a Basing Action Request (BAR (Part 1)) indentifying the specific basing criteria to
   HAF/A8PB.
   3.3.2. BAR (Part 1). Upon receipt of the BAR (Part 1), HAF/A8PB reviews the specific
   basing criteria provided and recommends adjustments as necessary. After the criteria is
   reviewed, HAF/A8PB will determine how the specific basing criteria is staffed (or if higher
   level approval is needed) through the AFSBS (BRRP, SB-ESB) to obtain SECAF/CSAF
   approval for the criteria.
   3.3.3. Candidate List. Once the specific basing criteria is approved, the AFISRA/A5CB will
   apply the approved criteria to an enterprise-wide look, and generate a ranked candidate list.
8                                                           AFISRAI10-501 21 MARCH 2011


    Considering the enterprise as a whole will help AFISRA/A5CB strategically determine
    appropriate site survey candidate locations. The candidate list is put in alphabetical order
    and submitted to HAF/A8PB via a BAR (Part 2). HAF/A8PB will forward the list to the
    BRRP to review/endorse and refine it further by using military factors. The site survey
    candidate list is staffed through the AFSBS, to obtain SECAF/CSAF approval.
    3.3.4. Top Candidates. From the refined and ranked candidate list, the top candidates will be
    selected for site survey and inclusion in the EIAP. The exact number of candidates selected
    for site surveys depend upon the number of sites needed and the likelihood site surveys might
    declare a site unacceptable. At no time will the refined ranked candidate list be released to
    the public or personnel outside the process for that specific basing action.
    3.3.5. Site Survey. Upon site survey approval (typically after submitting the BAR (Part 2)),
    HAF/A8PB will assign HQ AFISRA a Site Survey Control number. The SCN is needed
    prior to conducting any site survey(s) or EIAPs. Beyond planning, ensure that no
    commitment of Air Force resources such as, but not limited to, movement of equipment,
    force structure or personnel onto an installation occurs prior to completion of a site survey,
    EIAP, and receipt of basing approval. Basing process for single and multiple site surveys are
    at Attachments 4 and 5.
    3.3.6. BAR (Part 3) Completion. AFISRA/A5CB will complete the BAR (Part 3) and
    provide a list of preferred and reasonable alternatives. AFISRA/A5CB will forward the
    completed site survey(s) and EIAPs to HAF/A8PB for BRRP analysis and assessment. Bases
    within each category will be listed in alphabetical order. The BRRP will assess AFISRA’s
    recommended basing alternative options, coordinate through the SB-ESG and provide a
    basing recommended solution for a SECAF/CSAF decision. Once approved, HAF/A8P will
    sign the Basing Decision Memorandum (BDM).
    3.3.7. Basing Decision Memorandum (BDM). AFISRA/A5CB will execute the basing
    decision based on the BDM guidance. HAF/A8PB, along with AF/A1M, will ensure force
    structure changes are placed into the SAF/LL annual Force Structure Announcement.

THE SITE SURVEY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS PROCESS (EIAP)

4.1. Site Survey. A site survey is an authorized field visit, by an individual or team, to an
installation/location for the purpose of evaluating it for suitability for a proposed new mission or
mission relocation to that site. Additionally, the site survey may be used as a tool in the
decision-making process for a proposed program change, a pre-determined program change, or
for a new mission site. Site surveys may, in part, consist of preliminary examinations, field
investigations, etc. Since site surveys are considered ―pre-decisional‖, documentation from all
site surveys are treated as ―For Official Use Only‖ in accordance with AFI 31-401, Information
Security Program Management or higher as dictated.
4.2. OPR for Site Surveys. AFISRA/A5CB is the primary office of responsibility for Site
Surveys; as such, A5CB determines if a site survey is needed. It generally takes one to three
months to prepare for, obtain approval, and complete a site survey (see Attachments 4 and 5, Site
Survey Process). The site survey team is led by A5CB with HQ AFISRA staff representation
and other subordinate staff elements as appropriate. Site survey team members can consist of
any or all AFISRA functional(s) depending on the needs of the site being surveyed. Having as
much functional involvement as possible applies an objective approach to determining facility
requirements and estimated associated costs to implement a basing action at a given
installation/location.
4.3. Site Survey Control Number (SCN). As mentioned in Chapter 3 of this document, a site
survey is initiated with the submission of a BAR by AFISRA/A5CB to HAF/A8PB. A Site
Survey Control Number (SCN) must be assigned by HAF/A8PB and received by
AFISRA/A5CB prior to the earliest basing visit (exceptions may be granted by HAF/A8PB). All
correspondence shall reference this SCN. If locations other than those originally identified in the
request need to be surveyed, HAF/A8PB must be contacted to amend the BAR. Once the Site
Survey is completed, AFISRA/A5CB has 45 working days to submit the final Site Survey report
to HAF/A8PB.
4.4. Site Survey Approval Authority. HAF/A8PB has approval authority for all site surveys
conducted on AF installations. HAF/A8PB may grant exceptions to the requirement for site
surveys on a case-by-case basis. If inter-MAJCOM coordination is required, AFISRA/A5CB
will coordinate the action with the host agency. Furthermore, site survey approval does not
constitute Air Staff approval of the site as the final basing location. Site survey approval
authority also does not constitute authority to begin basing actions, take real-estate related
actions or approve Military Construction (MILCON). However, MAJCOMs may expend funds
to support planning at approved site survey locations.
4.5. Host Base Coordination. After receiving the SCN (which is normally issued by
HAF/A8PB in Memo format), AFISRA/A5CB will coordinate with the anticipated host
MAJCOM of the installation to be surveyed. This will be done via e-mail in Memorandum
format (see Attachment 6, Site Survey Memorandum), and as a minimum, contain the following
information:
 10                                                           AFISRAI10-501 21 MARCH 2011


   4.5.1. The BAR information and project description, which provides initial identification of
   infrastructure/environmental concerns and any other issues that need to be addressed before
   and/or during the site survey.
   4.5.2. The team size and point of contact, to include name and grade of senior member.
   4.5.3. Initial statement of support needed by the survey team during the site visit (billeting,
   transportation, etc).
   4.5.4. Proposed dates for each location of the site survey.
4.6. Items Addressed by Site Survey. As a minimum, the site survey team shall address costs
and benefits of the proposed action and assess potential impacts to existing missions, housing,
infrastructure, manpower, and any other applicable base operating support. Surveys shall briefly
address potential environmental impacts, proposed method of transaction (permit, license, lease),
or any additional interest areas as required. Prior to submitting the final site survey report to Air
Staff, AFISRA/A5CB shall obtain coordination on the site survey report from the affected
installation and the owning MAJCOM.
4.7. Completion of Site Survey. Once a site survey is complete, the agency conducting the site
survey shall ensure the space being considered remains valid and available.             It is
AFISRA/A5CB’s responsibility to immediately notify HAF/A8PB of any changes in the space
under consideration.
4.8. Follow-on Surveys. Requesting organizations shall coordinate follow-on surveys and
survey support to an already surveyed location through the host MAJCOM. Approval for
follow-on surveys is not required from HAF/A8PB; however an informational copy of all
correspondence shall be provided to HAF/A8PB. Follow-on survey correspondence shall use the
original SCN followed by an alpha-numeric suffix (e.g. SCN 01-17A, 01-17B, etc).
4.9. Site surveys at overseas Locations. Non-US territory or possessions must follow the same
procedures outlined in the paragraphs above. See AFI 10-504, Overseas Basing Realignments
for additional information and requirements.
4.10. Environmental Impact Analysis Process. The EIAP is implemented through Title 32,
Code of Federal Regulations, Part 989 (32 CFR Part 989) and begins with the generation of an
Air Force Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis. A copy of the Air Force Form
813 will be sent to the installation impacted by the AFISRA basing action. The Air Force Form
813 contains two main elements: The Purpose and Need for the Action and the Description of
Proposed Action and Alternatives (DOPAA). The AF Form 813 defines the scope of the action,
discusses reasonable alternatives, and helps in determining the appropriate level of
environmental analysis required. Moreover, the AF 813 initiates the required analytical
assessment of environmental impacts associated with proposed program actions as mandated by
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (Public Law 91-190). NEPA requires
analysis of the environmental effects of major federal actions. AFI 32-7061, The Environmental
Impact Analysis Process, governs Air Force NEPA compliance for installations in the United
States and its territories. When proposed basing actions are considered at non-AF installations,
the appropriate service-specific guidance for implementing NEPA will be followed. The final
beddown decision can be made only after completion of all required environmental
documentation.
AFISRAI10-501 21 MARCH 2011                                                                 11


  4.10.1. Integration of the EIAP during the initial planning stages of proposed basing actions
  will ensure planning and decisions reflect environmental requirements, avoid delays later in
  the process, and preclude potential conflict. The AFISRA’s focal point for AF 813
  development associated with force structure and organizational changes is AFISRA/A7C.
  Furthermore, AFISRA/A7C will ensure the EIAP is initiated by identifying the appropriate
  proponent for the proposed action and facilitating completion and submission of the AF 813
  to the appropriate host-installation(s) Environmental Planning Function(s). Although the AF
  813 can generally be completed quickly, completion of the associated EIAP can take
  anywhere from six months to two years, depending on the program action. Early
  identification of program action requirements is highly recommended, not only to facilitate
  the EIAP, but also for programming out year funding requirements. Note that although a
  PPlan or PMsg can be initiated or published prior to completion of the EIAP, and some
  supporting actions can be accomplished, no irreversible actions can take place until the EIAP
  is complete (i.e. no dollar expenditures, movement of assets such as people, systems, etc.).
  HQ ISR Agency/A7C can provide further information regarding the EIAP.

                                           Chapter 5

      PROGRAMMING PLANS (PPLANS) / PROGRAMMING MESSAGES (PMSG)

5.1. PPlan/PMsg Development. PPlans/PMsgs are developed to support the implementation of
a variety of program actions (see para 5.1.1. below). Each action must be approved by the
appropriate authority, and the approval must be documented. "Appropriate" approval authority
includes PCR, PAD, and OCR and BRAC related actions. In some cases it may occur that none
of the four standard approval authority elements are applicable. In such instances documented
approval of the proposed action must be obtained before a PPlan or PMsg may be implemented
(i.e., staff summary sheet for the proposal, e-mail, verbal direction, message, etc.). The PPlan
and PMsg process is located at Attachment 7.
   5.1.1. Programming Plan (PPlan). A directive, coordinated document, consisting of a Basic
   Plan and supporting functional staff annexes, which defines the actions required, and outlines
   the responsibilities for achieving a given program objective. The primary types of actions for
   which PPlans are developed include unit activations and inactivations; realignments
   involving the physical move of people or assets; base closures; beddown of weapons
   systems; unit conversions from one weapons system to another; beddown and/or integration
   of specialized systems or unique organizational constructs; and increases or decreases in a
   unit's assigned mission.
   5.1.2. Programming Message (PMsg). A PMsg may be used in lieu of a PPlan when less
   comprehensive documentation will suffice to implement a program objective. For example, a
   PMsg is often used when limited functional involvement is required to execute the action. A
   PMsg may also be used as an interim measure to establish the overall goal and provide basic
   guidance pertaining to a major program action while more comprehensive documentation is
   being developed. This is the method of choice when planning time is limited.
5.2. Overall Planning Process. Development of the PPlan or PMsg is only one element in the
overall planning process. The following information is provided to facilitate an understanding of
where the PPlan/PMsg fits into the process and the importance of initiating the process in a
timely manner.
   5.2.1. Requests for PPlan/PMsg Development. AFISRA staff offices and subordinate units
   requesting AFISRA PPlan/PMsg development will submit an official request via memo to
   AFISRA/A5CB. The memo should ask for a review of the program action for determination
   of PPlan/PMsg and related requirements. This should be done with as much lead time as
   possible, as the time required to complete the entire planning process could be a long one.
   Once approval authority is confirmed, AFISRA/A5CB will determine if the basing action
   should be in a PPlan or PMsg, provide a PPlan/PMsg control number, and assign an
   Implementation Manager to provide ―cradle-to-grave‖ oversight of the program action. A
   basic PPlan/PMsg will be accomplished and a finalized product will be developed.
   5.2.2. The PPlan Implementation Manager. The PPlan Implementation Manager will
   coordinate between the proponent’s assigned program manager and appropriate AFISRA
   personnel to initiate all planning requirements.
AFISRAI10-501 21 MARCH 2011                                                                   13


5.3. PPlan/PMsg Approval Authority. The AFISRA Director of Plans, Programs,
Requirements, and Assessments (AFISRA/A5/8/9) is the sole approval and release authority for
AFISRA PPlans and PMsgs. Approved PPlan/PMsg will be distributed electronically.
5.4. Agency Relationship. AFISRA PPlans/PMsgs are directive upon the AFISRA staff and
agencies subordinate to this headquarters. AFISRA PPlans/PMsgs will not task higher-echelon
agencies or non-AFISRA organizations.
5.5. Wing, Center, and Unit PPlans. AFISRA wings, centers and units, are encouraged to
develop plans or supplements whenever the need arises to manage programming actions of any
type at their respective levels. Guidance or tasking contained in wing/center/unit supplements
plans will neither supersede nor interfere with the guidance or tasking contained in any AFISRA
PPlan or PMsg. Also, wing/center/unit PPlans/PMsgs will not task higher-echelon agencies or
non-AFISRA organizations. A sample format/content model for a wing/center/unit supplement is
at Attachment 8 and PPlan/PMsg samples/templates can be obtained by contacting
AFISRA/A5CB. However, AFISRA wings, centers and units are free to develop or use a format
tailored to better suit their needs.
5.6. Joint PPlans. When a program action requires a joint agency/command PPlan or PMsg,
tasking of organizations belonging to the other affected agencies or command is at the discretion
of that organization. AFISRA will task its own units.
   5.6.1. Lead Agency for Joint Basing. When AFISRA is the lead agency for a joint
   agency/command PPlan/PMsg, all guidance contained in this instruction will apply. When
   another organization has the lead, guidance contained in that organization’s respective
   governing publication will apply.
   5.6.2. Transferring Assets. Normally, when assets are to be transferred from one
   organization to the other, if a PPlan/PMsg is required, the gaining organization will serve as
   the lead for PPlan/PMsg development. AFISRA/A5CB will serve as the focal point to
   provide input as appropriate, and ensure full staff coordination as required.
5.7. Staff Support of AFISRA PPlans/PMsgs. AFISRA staff offices designated as the OPR
for PPlans/PMsgs within their functional areas are depicted in Table 5.1. These offices will
provide a point of contact to serve as the FAM for each PPlan/PMsg tasking requirement.

   5.7.1. Input to PPlans/PMsgs. Depending on the nature of the program action, various
   AFISRA staff offices beyond the FAM may be called upon to provide input to
   PPlans/PMsgs, through the respective PPlan/PMsg FAM for each area (listed in Table 5.1).
   Additionally, when an AFISRA PPlan or PMsg necessitates a PPlan Development
   Conference and/or Site Activation Task Force (SATAF), representation from other AFISRA
   staff offices may be requested as appropriate. Functional area expert representation during
   the PPlan/PMsg development and SATAF processes are integral to ensure all requirements
   and responsibilities are accurately identified to support program actions. Therefore, AFISRA
   staff offices asked to provide input/support for PPlan/SATAF-related activities are required
   by this Instruction to fulfill this obligation. Chapter 6 discusses SATAFs in more depth.
   5.7.2. Progress Report Responsibility. Overarching responsibility for reporting on the status
   of PPlan/PMsg milestones and action items tasked to AFISRA staff offices rests with the
   designated FAM for PPlans/PMsg within each functional area. Thus, PPlan/PMsg FAM will
   ensure the establishment of internal administrative procedures to support the reporting
   process within their directorate. AFISRA/A5CB will provide training and guidance as
   necessary to support this policy.
5.8. PPlan/PMsg Development Responsibilities.
   5.8.1. AFISRA/A5CB Development Responsibilities. A5CB will:
      5.8.1.1. Assign a PPlan/PMsg Implementation Manager, hereafter referred to as the
      Implementation Manager.
      5.8.1.2. Validate the PPlan/PMsg requirement, including supporting requirements (Site
      Survey, DOPAA, and SATAF).
      5.8.1.3. Develop the basic PPlan/PMsg, including a list of draft program milestones,
      based on input from the Program Manager.
      5.8.1.4. If the PPlan/PMsg is classified, establish security guidance for inclusion in the
      PPlan/PMsg, based on input from the Program Manager.
      5.8.1.5. Coordinate with designated AFISRA PPlan FAM’s to generate PPlan/PMsg
      inputs (with emphasis on finalizing the program milestones).
      5.8.1.6. For PPlans, initiate development of supporting functional staff annexes. Ensure
      the functional OPRs are provided with annex format/content models if needed.

     agencies of publication.
  5.8.2. The PPlan Implementation Manager Development Responsibilities:
     5.8.2.1. Ensure applicable preliminary steps in the planning process have been
     accomplished as outlined in this instruction prior to initiating PPlan/PMsg development.
     5.8.2.2. Act as liaison between the Program Manager and the PPlan Developer (A5CB),
     to ensure all information required to draft the PPlan/PMsg is made available, and that the
     information is provided in a timely manner.
     5.8.2.3. If applicable, chair the associated PPlan/PMsg Integrated Product Team (IPT) or
     PPlan Development Conference, if a conference is required. Coordinate with the PPlan
     Developer for guidance on preparing for and conducting the conference, as necessary.
     5.8.2.4. Establish progress reporting criteria associated with AFISRA PPlans and PMsgs,
     and ensure the criteria is set forth in each individual PPlan/PMsg.
  5.8.3. Functional Area Manager Development Responsibilities:
     5.8.3.1. Provide input to the draft Basic PPlan/PMsg (with emphasis on program
     milestones) and develop supporting functional staff annexes and action items. This
     responsibility may include attending a PPlan Development Conference and establishing a
     working group for the respective functional area.
     5.8.3.2. Ensure coordination among all other three-letter staff offices within the
     respective functional area prior to submission of PPlan/PMsg inputs.
     5.8.3.2.1. Ensure coordination with other AFISRA staff offices, with counterparts in

     input.
     5.8.3.3. Provide required input to AFISRA/A5CB in accordance with established
     suspense dates.
5.9. PPlan/PMsg Implementation Responsibilities. AFISRA/A5CB                   supports   PPlan
implementation through management of the PPlan/PMsg process.
  5.9.1. AFISRA/A5CB Implementation Responsibilities:
     5.9.1.1. Ensure criteria as set forth in the PPlan/PMsg is implemented.
     5.9.1.2. Serve as the focal point for all status updates, including the establishment of
     reporting cycle due dates, and provide a ―reminder‖ to reporting agencies regarding the
     due dates.
 16                                                         AFISRAI10-501 21 MARCH 2011


       5.9.1.3. Provide a monthly update to all AFISRA directors and affected wing
       commanders regarding PPlan/PMsg status, annotating if milestones are ―COMPLETE‖,
       ―WORKING‖, ―BEHIND SCHEDULE‖, or ―REQUIRING A CHANGE.‖
       5.9.1.4. Provide a quarterly update to AFISRA/A5/8/9 regarding PPlan/PMsg status,
       with emphasis on program milestones that are ―BEHIND SCHEDULE‖ or
       ―REQUIRING A CHANGE.‖
   5.9.2. Implementation Manager Responsibilities.
       5.9.2.1. Report the status of progress towards meeting the PPlan/PMsg objectives in
       accordance with the guidance set forth in this instruction.
       5.9.2.2. Progress Reporting. Proactively review the FAM’s comments following each
       monthly reporting cycle. Take action to resolve any problems brought forth. Use the
       workflow box to keep all parties apprised of problems related to the PPlan/PMsg and
       proposed corrective actions.
       5.9.2.3. During each monthly reporting cycle, coordinate with the appropriate Functional
       Area Manager(s) to ensure the applicable OPR(s) are resolving items assessed as
       ―BEHIND SCHEDULE‖ or ―CHANGE REQUIRED.‖
   5.9.3. Functional Area Manager Implementation Responsibilities:
       5.9.3.1. Oversee the accomplishment of AFISRA milestones and action items within the
       respective functional area or that adequate workarounds are established if problems are
       encountered.
       5.9.3.2. Provide Progress Reports in accordance with all applicable provisions of this
       instruction, and as directed by the FAM’s respective PPlan Annex or the reporting
       guidance set forth in the PPlan/PMsg.
       5.9.3.3. Monitor the adequacy and currency of the respective functional area annex, and
       submit required revisions to AFISRA/A5CB.
       5.9.3.4. Monitor the status of field action items within the respective functional area and
       provide assistance to affected units as required.
5.10. Signatures on PPlans/PMsgs. To support the electronic processing of PPlans/PMsgs,
signatures are not required on the basic plan and functional annexes. However, the basic plan
and annexes must be annotated as ―//SIGNED//‖ over the signature block of the designated
approval authority. This policy does NOT negate the requirement for actual approval by the
designated authority.
5.11. Changes to PPlans/PMsgs. Changes to directed program actions necessitate a change to
the PPlan/PMsg. Additionally, documentation from follow-on SATAFs is included as changes
to PPlans/PMsgs. AFISRA/A5CB will electronically file all changes to PPlans/PMsgs and
ensure all participating FAMs, subordinate units and agencies receive a copy of the updated
PPlan/PMsg.
5.12. Progress Reports.
   5.12.1. Functional Area Managers and Unit Program Managers. AFISRA Functional Area
   Managers and Unit Program Managers will submit PPlan/PMsg reports and PPlan/PMsg-
AFISRAI10-501 21 MARCH 2011                                                                    17


   related problems to the AFISRA/A5CB PPlan Implementation Manager. The progress
   reporting process is at Attachment 9. The action office having functional responsibility must
   answer action agency requests for additions, deletions, or changes to the PPlan/PMsg. The
   Implementation Manager must concur on all actions.
   5.12.2. Due Dates. The Functional Area/Unit Program Managers will coordinate with
   milestone/time-phased action offices of primary responsibility and include the status of all
   PPlan/PMsg milestones and time-phased actions within the respective area of responsibility.
   Reports should be current as of the date of submission and are due to arrive by the first duty
   day of each month, commencing with the month following PPlan/PMsg publication (unless
   otherwise specified in the PPlan/PMsg). If updates to milestones/actions are not provided by
   the fifth working day, the milestone/action will be reported as ―NO UPDATE
   PROVIDED.‖
   5.12.3. Implementation Manager. The Implementation Manager will advise action agencies
   within 5 days after receiving PPlan/PMsg progress reports of recommended changes that
   have been disapproved, including the reason for disapproval. The Implementation Manager
   will consolidate information received by the FAMs and forward a copy of the report by NLT
   the 7th duty day of each month to each action office through workflow channels.
   5.12.4. In-Progress Reviews (IPRs). The Implementation Manager will hold IPRs as needed
   to ensure AFISRA and other participating staffs remain apprised of the progress towards
   closing open Milestones and action items. The AFISRA/A5CB OPRs will be responsible to
   announce and schedule the IPRs.
   5.12.5. Format. FAM’s will input information pertaining to the status of their
   Milestones/Action Items within a given PPlan/PMsg. Milestones/actions will be listed as
   ―COMPLETE‖, ―WORKING‖, ―REQUIRING A CHANGE‖ or ―BEHIND
   SCHEDULE.‖ If a change in the completion date is required or the milestone completion is
   delayed, give the revised estimated completion date and reason for the change or delay in the
   remarks section. A sample report is at Attachment 10.
   5.12.6. Significant PPlan/PMsg-Related Problems. Report problems that would delay
   completion to the Implementation Manager as they occur. Include current status and any
   plans to resolve the issue.
   5.12.7. The Report. The Implementation Manager will prepare changes by consolidating
   information from monthly progress reports and other data and send messages (electronically)
   to all offices as needed.
5.13. PPlan/PMsg Closure/Termination.
   5.13.1. All Actions Completed. A PPlan/PMsg is terminated when all PPlan/PMsg
   Milestones/Action Items are completed. The Implementation Manager coordinates as
   appropriate to confirm completion and forwards a PPlan/PMsg termination request to the
   PPlan/PMsg approving authority and, if approved, publishes a Closure Message. The
   Closure notification of a PPlan will be in the form of an E-mail to all affected organizations.
   5.13.2. Open Actions Remaining. A PPlan/PMsg may be terminated when all major
   PPlan/PMsg actions have been completed and the remaining minor actions to achieve the
   PPlan/PMsg objective can be completed through the normal course of business or normal
 18                                                       AFISRAI10-501 21 MARCH 2011


   staffing actions. The Implementation Manager coordinates with the action office(s)
   responsible for the remaining actions, through the associated AFISRA Functional Area
   Manager, and with their concurrence, may take action to pursue termination.
5.14. Security Classification and Downgrading of Declassified Information. Classify
PPlan/PMsg data according to content, in accordance with DOD 5200.1-R, and ensure protection
of classified information in accordance with AFI 31-401. If any aspect of a PPlan/PMsg is
classified CONFIDENTIAL or higher, the classification of all paragraphs throughout the
document will be annotated in like manner (even if only one sentence in the entire document is
classified). AFISRA/A5CB will notify agencies on distribution for classified PPlans/PMsgs as
soon as possible following public announcement or official notification regarding the downgrade
of classified information.
5.15. Documentation Management Procedures. As the AFISRA OPR for PPlans/PMsg,
A5CB maintains an electronic master file of all PPlans/PMsgs completed by AFISRA. The file
will contain a copy of the initial PPlan/PMsg draft (and any formal changes thereof), all
coordination involved in creating the PPlan/PMsg (and any formal changes thereof), a copy of
the final PPlan/PMsg (and any changes thereof), progress reports, a copy of the PPlan/PMsg
Closure Message/E-Mail, and all other correspondence related to the PPlan/PMsg project.
PPlans/PMsgs published prior to publication of this instruction will not be revised solely to
comply with these provisions. New PPlans/PMsgs or those undergoing a revision to reflect a
SATAF will comply with the provisions of this Instruction.

                        SITE ACTIVITION TASK FORCE (SATAF)

6.1. Site Activation Task Force (SATAF). A team of MAJCOM functional experts chartered
to travel to an installation to identify all the actions necessary to ensure a beddown at that
installation is successful. SATAFs provide periodic, on-scene assistance to unit-level agencies to
accomplish a program objective. The SATAF structure is comprised of headquarters team
members and representation from the affected unit(s), which are organized into functional
working groups. A SATAF may be convened to support bringing a program, system, equipment
and/or site to operational readiness. SATAFs are also conducted to facilitate unit activations,
inactivations, relocations, and conversions from one weapons system to another. As well as
being the focal point for PPlans/PMsgs, AFISRA/A5/8/9 is responsible for managing the
associated Site Activation Task Force (SATAF) process.
6.2. SATAF Team. The SATAF structure is comprised of headquarters team members and
representation from the affected unit(s), which are organized into functional working groups.
Each working group has an assigned chairperson, who functions under the auspices of the
SATAF Team Chief. SATAFs may be conducted to facilitate unit activations, inactivations,
relocations, and conversions from one weapon system to another.
6.3. SATAF Documentation. Whenever possible, documentation resulting from the SATAF
process is incorporated into its respective PPlan/PMsg. The documentation is comprised of
minutes for each functional working group, action items identified by each working group, and
an executive summary. If a SATAF is conducted for an action directed by a PMsg versus a
PPlan, the PMsg will be released as soon as possible and the associated SATAF minutes will be
published following the SATAF.
6.4. National Guard Bureau (NGB) SATAF. The NGB SATAF process is conducted by the
NGB Ready Team IPT, which may request augmentation by appropriate members from AFISRA
and/or supporting agency staffs to provide assistance, as needed and where appropriate, to
accomplish NGB ISR related force structure actions. Assessment criteria for the NGB will be as
determined by the NGB Ready Team IPT.
6.5. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) SATAF. The AFRC SATAF process is conducted
by the HQ AFRC/A8 Plans and Programs, which may request augmentation by appropriate
members from AFISRA and/or supporting agency staffs to provide assistance, as needed and
where appropriate, to accomplish AFRC ISR Total Force Integration (TFI) actions. Assessment
criteria for the AFRC will be as determined by HQ AFRC/A8.
6.6. SATAF Required. AFISRA/A5CB will determine if a SATAF is needed. It generally
takes anywhere from one to four months to complete the combined PPlan/SATAF portion of the
planning process and to publish the documentation. Factors that affect how long it will take
include, but are not limited to, the amount of lead time available, the complexity of the action
and number of agencies involved, SATAF scheduling conflicts, delays in obtaining PCR/OCR
approval, further changes to PCRs or OCRs as they go through their respective coordination
processes, and availability of information/amount of research required to draft the basic
PPlan/PMsg.

6.7. AFISRA/A5CB Support for SATAF. AFISRA/A5CB will:
   6.7.1. Designate an individual who is appropriately versed in the respective program to serve
   as the SATAF Team Chief (usually the designated Implementation Manager).
   6.7.2. Generate a SATAF announcement message detailing required unit support and issue a
   tasker (through A5/8 if required) requesting staff participation in the SATAF.
   6.7.3. Provide each Working Group Chairperson with the materials required for the
   Chairpersons to perform their duties during the SATAF. Ensure the Chairperson understands
   the Assessment Criteria to be used for the SATAF: GREEN - program or action on track;
   objective and timing attainable. YELLOW - high-risk workarounds and/or insufficient
   information available for program assessment. RED - program or action objective will not
   be attained and/or prescribed timelines will not be met.
6.8. SATAF Team Chief Responsibilities. As the SATAF Team Chief, AFISRA/A5CB will:
   6.8.1. Serve as the SATAF Team Chief, following the SATAF Team Chief Responsibilities
   guidance, if a SATAF is required to support the PPlan/PMsg.
   6.8.2. Review the PPlan/PMsg and provide any recommended revisions.
   6.8.3. Review this instruction to gain an understanding of the purpose and mechanics of the
   SATAF, if needed.
   6.8.4. Coordinate with the host base regarding proposed SATAF dates. This will generally
   be accomplished by contacting the Wing/XP at the host base.
   6.8.5. Determine the necessary working groups, and send a tasker to the designated
   PPlan/PMsg OPR three-letter(s) requesting appointment of a Working Group Chairperson for
   their functional area. The tasker should request the appointed individual(s) enlist
   representation from the other three-letters within the functional area, as applicable, and a
   consolidated list of names/ranks/functional address symbols/telephone numbers. Security
   clearances should be requested for classified SATAFs.
   6.8.6. Issue a formal SATAF announcement message to the host base. The message should
   specify the purpose of the SATAF and confirm the SATAF dates and agenda. Additionally,
   the message should request identification of a unit POC and state the host base support
   requirements, which generally includes providing a location for the inbrief, outbrief, and
   daily integration meetings, as well as a facility for working groups to convene each day. The
   inbrief/outbrief location should have computerized overhead projection capability. Two to
   three internet-capable computers should be requested for the duration of the conference.
   Additionally, DSN telephone availability and a laser printer copier capable of producing a
   high-quality product are required to support the conference. Once the unit POC has been
   appointed confirm these details and coordinate the conference agenda. Be sure to schedule a
   courtesy meeting with the wing commander prior to the SATAF inbrief.
   6.8.7. Conduct a pre-SATAF meeting with AFISRA staff working group members to review
   the agenda and working group responsibilities. Ensure all travel and billeting arrangements
   have been completed (the SATAF Team Chief may choose to make arrangements or leave
   this responsibility to the individuals).
   6.8.8. Prepare the SATAF in-brief presentation.
AFISRAI10-501 21 MARCH 2011                                                                  21

   ensure a smooth flow of business.
   6.8.13. Conduct a daily integration meeting to discuss key working group issues and assess
   SATAF progress.
   6.8.14. Review working group minutes and action items, write a SATAF Executive
   Summary, and oversee compilation of the final SATAF report. Ensure the SATAF action
   items are complete, accurate, and properly coordinated so that they align under the
   appropriate functional area and there is no duplication.
   6.8.15. Prepare and present the SATAF outbrief.
   6.8.16. Submit the SATAF product to the Chief, Basing and Units Branch (AFISRA/A5CB)
   for final review and disposition, as soon as possible following the end of the SATAF.
   Normally this should be accomplished within five working days.
6.9. Functional Area Manager Responsibilities for SATAFs. Functional Area Managers
assigned to serve as a SATAF Working Group Chairperson will:
   6.9.1. Enlist representation from the other three-letters within the functional area, as
   applicable, to serve as members of the working group, and provide a consolidated list to
   AFISRA/A5CB by the associated suspense date.
   6.9.2. Ensure working group members make their travel and billeting arrangements, if they
   have not been made by the Team Chief.

Terms
Air Force Real Property— Any right, title, or interest in land, buildings, fixed improvements,
utilities, and other permanent additions to land. Examples include equipment attached to, and
made part of, buildings and structures (such as heating systems), but not movable equipment
(such as plant equipment).
Action Items— Actions which must be initiated and completed at a specific time to support
PPlan/PMsg implementation. Action items which are critical to a particular milestone or
milestones are identified as such within each PPlan.
Basing— Actions taken to position Air Force units (on AF or non-AF property) or non-USAF
entities on USAF real property. Basing is the process used to determine the location of a unit,
manpower, mission, or activity. Basing includes such actions as selecting sites and resolving
political, airspace, environmental, and beddown issues.
Beddown— The process and act of placing a unit, mission or activity on real property for longer
than one year. This applies to activities of all military branches, other DoD, non-DoD federal,
state and local governmental, and/or private agencies requesting the use of Air Force real
property. Beddown is considered the execution of a basing action.
Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)— Refers to the process the DoD has used to
reorganize its installation infrastructure to more efficiently and effectively support its force
structure, increase operational readiness and facilitate new ways of doing business. BRAC is
also frequently used colloquially to refer to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment
Commission as the ―BRAC Commission‖, even though the Commission’s initials are technically
―DBCRC.‖ Thus, ―BRAC‖ by itself refers to the DoD part of the base closure process, but
―BRAC Commission‖ refers to the independent Defense Base Closure and Realignment
Commission.
Critical Action— Action that must be completed/closed to achieve an associated milestone.
Complete or Partial Return— The permanent return of some or all US Air Force real property
and land at an installation on foreign territory to the host government.
Documented Approval Authority— PPlans/PMsgs require documented approval authority.
PCRs, PADs, and OCRs are the primary vehicles accepted as documented approval authority for
developing a PPlan or a PMsg.
Enhanced Use Leasing— The National Defense Authorization Act (PL 106-398, Section 2812)
establishes authority for outleasing Air Force real property in return for payment of consideration
in cash or in kind. The lease may provide for the alteration, repair, or improvement of the leased
 26                                                           AFISRAI10-501 21 MARCH 2011


property by the lessee as part or all of the consideration, including maintenance, protection,
alteration, or restoration of Air Force real property. This includes construction of new facilities,
facilities as operational support, or other on-base services.
Enterprise—Wide Look – Takes the criteria developed by a proponent and approved by the
basing process, to narrow a list of approximately 206 major/minor installations world-wide, to
arrive at a refined list of basing candidates. The refined list of basing candidates will identify
locations for site surveys and environmental studies, to generate an analysis of alternatives for
the proposed basing action. The criteria should be of such a nature to provide transparent,
repeatable, and defendable results.
Functional Area Manager (FAM)— A Functional Area Manager is the focal point within an
AFISRA staff agency tasked to provide key input to and/or track a PPlan or PMsg for that
respective functional area.
Major Installation (Air Force Base, Air Base, Air Reserve Base, or Air Guard Base)— A
self-supporting center of operations for actions of importance to Air Force combat, combat
support, or training activities. Operated by an Active, Reserve, or Guard unit of wing size or
larger with all land, facilities, and organic support needed to accomplish the unit mission. Must
have real property accountability through ownership, lease, permit, or other written agreement
for all real estate and facilities. Agreements with foreign governments which give the Air Force
jurisdiction over real property meet this requirement. Shared-use agreements (as opposed to
joint-use agreements where the Air Force owns the runway) do not meet the criteria to be major
installations.
Minor Installation (Air Force Station, Air Station, Air Reserve Station, or Air Guard
Station)— Facility operated by Active, Reserve, or Guard unit of at least squadron size that does
not otherwise satisfy all the criteria for a major installation. Examples of minor installations are
Reserve and Guard flying operations that are located at civilian-owned airports.
Milestone— A key event identified in the PPlan/PMsg which is essential to accomplishment of
the programmed objective as scheduled.
Non—Air Force Real Property - Real property not owned or managed by the Department of
the Air Force.
Non—Air Force Entity – Any unit, group, or organization not part of the Air Force (e.g.,
private, commercial, non-profit, local government, state government, federal government or
Service other then AF).
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). A designated staff office or field—level agency that
is responsible for a particular aspect of a PPlan or PMsg (i.e., functional annex OPR, action item
OPR, milestone OPR, etc.).
Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR)— A designated staff office or field-level agency
whose input is required to facilitate an OPR's accomplishment of a particular PPlan or PMsg
related responsibility. An OCR is a request for an organizational action such as a unit activation,
inactivation, redesignation, or variation to a standard structure. An OCR is not required for
organizational changes resulting from approved force structure actions.
Other Activities— Air Force unit or activity that has little or no real property accountability for
the real estate it occupies. Examples include Active, Guard, or Reserve Air Force units that are
AFISRAI10-501 21 MARCH 2011                                                                        27


located on installations belonging to other Services or leased office space that supports recruiting
detachments, Civil Air Patrol, etc.
PPlan/PMsg Development Conference— A conference convened for the purpose of
developing a complete draft or final PPlan/PMsg, under the general direction of AFISRA/A5CB.
At a minimum, attendances include the Implementation Manager, the Program Manager, and all
applicable Functional Area Managers. Functional Area Managers are generally called upon to
formulate a working group comprised of themselves plus representatives from the other AFISRA
staff offices within their functional area. Additionally, the Implementation Manager may request
representation from units/agencies affected by or involved in PPlan/PMsg implementation. The
representatives participate in the working groups and provide input to the PPlan/PMsg through
the Working Group Chairpersons.             Not all PPlan/PMsg actions necessitate an IPT.
AFISRA/A5CB will determine if an IPT is appropriate based on the complexity of the program
action.
PPlan/PMsg Implementation Manager— A PPlan/PMsg Implementation Manager is the
individual appointed within AFISRA to provide ―cradle-to-grave‖ administrative oversight for a
program action that requires a PPlan/PMsg (normally AFISRA/A5CB).
Program Manager— In the context of this instruction, a Program Manager is the individual
appointed by the proponent for a program action to provide AFISRA/A5CB with information
required to develop a PPlan/PMsg for that action. The Program Manager is further responsible
for managing the day-to-day issues associated with the action with an overall goal of ensuring
the completion of the program milestones identified in the PPlan/PMsg.
Programming Plan (PPlan)— A directive, coordinated document, consisting of a Basic Plan
and supporting functional staff annexes, which defines the actions required, and outlines the
responsibilities for achieving a given program objective. The primary types of actions for which
PPlans are developed include unit activations; deactivations; realignments involving the physical
move of people or assets; base closures; beddown of weapons systems; unit conversions from
one weapons system to another; beddown and/or integration of specialized systems or unique
organizational constructs; and increases or decreases in a unit's assigned mission.
Programming Message (PMsg)— A PMsg may be used in lieu of a PPlan when less
comprehensive documentation will suffice to implement a program objective. For example, a
PMsg is often utilized when limited functional involvement is required to execute the action. A
PMsg may also be used as an interim measure to establish the overall goal and provide basic
guidance pertaining to a major program action while more comprehensive documentation is
being developed. This is the method of choice when planning time is limited.
Proponent— The office, unit, or activity at any level that initiates an Air Force basing action.
Standby Facility or Installation— A facility or installation located on foreign territory but
designated by the United States for contingency or wartime use with the consent of the host
government, and at which the United States maintains little or no peacetime presence.
Support Site— Facility operated by Active, Reserve, or Guard unit that provides general
support to the Air Force mission and does not satisfy the criteria for a major or minor
installation. Examples of support sites are: missile tracking sites, radar bombing scoring sites,
Air Force-owned contractor-operated plants, and radio relay sites.

Unit Program Manager— Individual appointed by the unit commander to serve as the unit-
level point of contact for implementation of a PPlan/PMsg. Specific duties of the Unit Program
Manager will be spelled out in the applicable PPlan/PMsg.
US Territories— Territories associated with, or administered by, the U.S. Government,
including but not limited to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the
Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, Johnston Atoll, Midway Island, Virgin
Islands, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and Wake Island.
Unit PPlan Monitor— The unit office responsible for administrative management of the
PPlan/PMsg process.

MEMORANDUM FOR ACC/A5B, A5BG; 1 FW/XP
FROM: AFISRA/A5C
          102 Hall Blvd, STE 208
          San Antonio, TX 78243
SUBJECT: Langley AFB Site Survey Approval
1. AF ISR Agency (AFISRA)/A5C requests approval to conduct a Site Survey at Langley AFB,
VA, during the following proposed time frames: 8-12 Feb 2010 or 22-26 Feb 2010.
2. This Site Survey is being conducted to identify actions, responsible offices and timelines,
necessary to beddown an increase in the AFISRA population and the subsequent impact to the
Host Installation due to recent increases in DCGS manpower. HAF/A8PB has approved the Site
Survey and has issued Site Survey Control Number (SSCN): 10-24.
3. This increase is the result of a 2009 OSD Directive for the AF to increase the number of
Combat Air Patrols (CAPs) For DCGS to 50 by FY12-13 time frame. To meet the 50 CAP
increase, DCGS Manpower was increased by 2158 billets, which have been distributed across
the DCGS enterprise. Base operating support (BOS) was computed and added to the approved
initiative.
4. The Site Survey is designed to bring together all the participating organizations required to
support the increased DCGS manpower impact to the Host Installation (Operational space
requirements, Housing/Dorm availability, Medical support, Base Services, etc.). The Site
Survey is being conducted with the participation and support of AFISRA's 480 ISR Wing. The
480 ISR Wing, which is located on Langley AFB, will host the visit and is coordinating the visit
with ACC and the 1 FW.
5. AFISRA/A5CB will lead the Site Survey with the AFISRA extended enterprise team
participating. The 480 ISR Wing will be the AFISRA on-site coordinator and work with 1st FW
personnel to assist in the development of an agenda for the week, arrange meeting areas,
briefings, Comm/Computer support and meetings with appropriate host personnel to discuss the
increase in BOS requirements due to unit growth.
6. I solicit your cooperation, participation and continued support in conducting this visit.
AFISRA/A5CB has been working with ACC/A5BG, Mr. Craig Hughes and his office and is
looking forward to their continued support.
7. An Announcement Msg will be issued when the Site Survey is approved as well as the
official agenda which is currently being developed.
8. My POCs for this effort are Mr. Barnie Gavin (Team Lead), DSN 969-4601, e-mail:
Barnie.Gavin@us.af.mil or Mr. Douglas Wilkinson (Planning Coordinator), DSN: 945-4482, e-

3. AGENDA.

Determine through discussions with representatives from multiple organizations what actions
must be taken to smoothly transition DCGS operations into the new MILCON facility at Joint
Base Pearl Harbor-Hickman, HI. Primary discussions and resultant action items were based on a
briefing tasked to 578 ACSS during the earlier pre-SATAF that addressed potential
options/courses of action and associated cost estimates for DGS-5 site operations during the
move.

4. ACTION ITEM STATISTICAL SUMMARY:

   a. Action items opened -

   b. Action items closed - 0

   c. Overall Assessment - GREEN



5. DISCUSSION:
AFISRAI10-501 21 MARCH 2011                                                                     39


   a. Using the 578 ACSS briefing as a starting point for discussion, the working group
developed assumptions, milestones, and courses of action with associated pros and cons as a
baseline for action item development.

    b. The three options for the DCGS MILCON move included: no site downtime; minimal site
downtime (10-14 days); and 30-40 day downtime. The overarching premise that guided all
discussions was that there will be no impact on mission support to the AOR, and that the
MILCON move will be transparent to the ultimate customer of DCGS mission products and
services.

   c. A total of XXX action items were developed over the course of the SATAF, with an
overall assessment of YELLOW. Key action items include maintaining mission critical non-
baseline system capability during the move; the need for a full-time on-site project manager;
ensuring DART and FMV full operational capability during the MILCON project; and
developing an enterprise operations plan.
