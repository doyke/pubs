                                            Chapter 1

                              AIR FORCE S&T MANAGEMENT

1.1. Overview. This instruction establishes guidance and procedures for planning, governance,
and execution of the Air Force S&T Program. The Air Force S&T Program consists of Basic
Research, Applied Research, and Advanced Technology Development (research, development,
test and evaluation [RDT&E] budget activity categories 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, respectively). The
S&T Program must be responsive to Air Force capability needs while guarding against
technological surprise. It includes in-house laboratory and contracted activities to produce both
evolutionary and revolutionary technology-enabled opportunities.
     1.1.1. The Air Force plans and executes its S&T Program in accordance with the approved
     Air Force S&T Strategy and the associated Air Force S&T Plan as influenced by both
     external and internal “drivers” [contact SAF/AQR for access to the latest versions of these
     documents]. S&T drivers may include the National Military Strategy (NMS), the
     Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), Department of Defense (DoD) Guidance, Operating
     Concepts, wargames and exercises, long-term visionary reports and guidance and planning
     documents associated with the Air Force Strategic Planning System (AFSPS). Furthermore,
     the Air Force strives to maintain an appropriately balanced investment portfolio across basic
     research, applied research, and advanced technology development.
     1.1.2. Core Function Lead Integrators (CFLI) inform Air Force S&T investment through
     their Core Function Master Plan(s) (CFMP). CFLIs for each Air Force Service Core
     Function (SCF) produce a CFMP in collaboration with key stakeholders across the Air Force,
     including Headquarters Air Force (HAF) functionals and the Major Commands (MAJCOM).
     As part of the CFMP process, CFLIs identify key risk areas associated with their plan and
     may establish CCTs to evaluate materiel aspects of associated capability needs and to better
     vector capability development. The CFMPs align SCF strategy, operating concepts, and
     capability development, to include S&T specifically focused toward their SCF, to provide 20
     to 30-year constructs for enhancing Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global Power
     across the range of military operations (AF/A8 responsible for Air Force strategy and SCF
     policy matters).
        1.1.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC executes S&T planning in parallel with many
        other future capability planning efforts, such as AFSPC Integrated Planning Process, Air
        Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) technology maturation efforts, development
        planning analyses, future architecture planning, capability-based assessments analysis of
        alternatives, and requirements developed through the Joint Capabilities Integration and
        Development System (JCIDS) process. Some of these future capability efforts are
        conducted within AFSPC and some are conducted externally. The Space and Cyberspace
        Core Function Lead Integrator (CFLI) ensures all Command-driven and Command-
        sponsored future capability planning efforts are fully coordinated and integrated when
        applicable. The CFLI may use the Core Function Master Plan (CFMP) to document the
        synchronization and dependencies of each of these efforts with each other in the
        Capability Development and S&T Roadmaps.
AFI61-101_AFSPCSUP_I 23 OCTOBER 2013                                                                               5


   1.1.3. The Air Force S&T planning process provides a framework for the operational,
   acquisition, and S&T communities to work together in order to understand Air Force
   capability needs, identify associated technology needs and potential solutions, and then
   develop technology options for acquisition and operational community consideration. An
   input to this process may be capability needs identified through Capabilities-Based
   Assessments (CBA) or other capability planning analyses (refer to AFI 10-601, Operational
   Capability Requirements Development for more information on CBAs). A wide range of
   technology solution providers should be considered throughout Air Force S&T planning
   activities as necessary (e.g., Air Force Research Laboratory [AFRL], Army Research
   Laboratory, Naval Research Laboratory, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
   [DARPA], National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA], academia, industry, and
   appropriate foreign sources).
   1.1.4. The Air Force S&T planning framework is depicted in Figure 1.1 It reflects how
   S&T planning and governance fit within the larger DoD and Service planning, programming,
   and governance constructs. The box at the center top represents the technology needs and
   solutions identification process which encompass a range of collaborative activities.
   Collaboration among the MAJCOMs/CFLIs, acquisition centers, Program Executive Officers
   (PEO), and the Technology Executive Officer (TEO) is essential to (1) ensure S&T
   stakeholders understand Air Force capability needs and associated technology needs in order
   to develop potential technology solutions addressing those needs, and (2) to inform Air Force
   senior leaders, MAJCOMs, and the acquisition community of technology opportunities and
   the art of the possible.

     minimum, ATCs review and approve ATDs, recommend candidate FCCs for consideration
     by the Air Force S&T Group and Board, and review the S&T portfolio supporting each
     respective SCF. The Air Force S&T Group and Board are embedded within the S&T
     planning framework and are responsible for assessing and integrating Air Force technology
     needs, vetting and prioritizing candidate FCCs, and deliberating on other S&T matters as
     required. The Air Force S&T Group is an O-6 level body that makes recommendations to
     the Air Force S&T Board with respect to issues brought before the Group for consideration.
     Significant S&T programs endorsed by the Air Force S&T Board (e.g., FCCs, JCTDs, HAF-
     level S&T-related MOAs and MOUs) are validated by the Air Force Requirements Oversight
     Council (AFROC).
     1.1.6. To execute the S&T component of commissioned ATDs, JCTDs, and FCCs, the TEO
     assigns an S&T program manager and is responsible for resourcing the S&T effort; the
     sponsoring MAJCOMs conduct necessary Joint Capabilities Integration and Development
     System activities and prepare related documentation and plan and program appropriate
     resources for follow-on acquisition activities; and the Centers conduct associated
     development planning (DP) and pre-acquisition planning as required. Periodic updates are
     provided to the ATCs, Air Force S&T Group, Board, and AFROC as necessary.

                                AIR FORCE S&T PLANNING

2.1. Air Force S&T Planning. The Air Force will plan its S&T Program in accordance with
the approved Air Force S&T Strategy and guidance and planning documents associated with the
AFSPS (reference AFPD 90-11). The foundation of the S&T planning process is an agreed-upon
set of maintained S&T core competencies balanced with an investment portfolio of basic
research, applied research, and advanced technology development that produce both evolutionary
and revolutionary technologies. During Air Force S&T planning, near-, mid-, and far-term
warfighter capability needs, affordability, performance, competitive incentives, sustainability,
industrial base, and energy use are considered. Air Force S&T funds may be applied in the
absence of a validated user requirement or programmed funding for formal acquisition.
2.2. Capability Collaboration Team Technology Needs Identification. The CBA forms the
analytic basis for how capability needs are identified and is an integral part of the capabilities
planning process. For documented MAJCOM/CFLI capability needs that require materiel
solutions, CFLIs will establish CCTs to determine if S&T is required to address any associated
technology needs. The CCTs will include subject matter expert representatives from the
MAJCOM/CFLI, appropriate Center and/or PEO, AFRL, and other stakeholders as appropriate.
The output of the CCTs is a set of vetted technology needs required for ongoing or prospective
materiel solutions supporting documented capability needs. Technology needs resulting from
this process may be documented and prioritized by CFLIs in their CFMPs.
   2.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) Space and cyberspace CCTs shall document their S&T needs in the
   appropriate AFSPC Space or Cyberspace S&T Needs Database. These databases document
   CCT decisions regarding space and cyberspace S&T needs and potential solutions identified
   by the CCTs. They are the source for S&T guidance in the Space Superiority and Cyberspace
   Superiority CFMPs. HQ AFSPC/A5X or its designee shall maintain configuration control of
   these databases on behalf of the S&T community. These Space and Cyberspace Needs
   Databases           are           accessible          on           SIPRNET             at

                                                                FCCs, etc.) to advance technology
                                                                and reduce system acquisition risk

   2.2.2. (Added-AFSPC) S&T solution providers may propose non-traditional or innovative
   ideas not tied directly to currently documented S&T needs, sometimes referred to as
   “technology push”. These ideas will be vetted by space and cyberspace CCTs early in the
   needs identification process to ensure appropriate linkage to and evaluation by the
   operational, requirements and acquisition communities. S&T needs may then be added, as
   appropriate, to the AFSPC Space or Cyberspace S&T Needs Database.
2.3. Capability Collaboration Team Technology Solutions Formulation. Following
technology needs collaboration, CCTs will continue to identify potential technology solutions
that address the identified technology needs. Recommended technology solutions resulting from
this process may become S&T projects that AFRL initiates and executes through internal
planning processes or may be proposed as candidate ATDs, FCCs, or JCTDs which require
approval by their respective governing bodies. Furthermore, technology solutions may
necessitate a collaborative development activity with another Service or United States
Government organization requiring an MOA or MOU. International partners should be
considered when potential technology solutions are investigated in order to access foreign
expertise, funding, and strengthen S&T cooperation. As shown in Figure 2.1, S&T activities
will inform capability planning and foster related technology maturation efforts to reduce system
acquisition risks. Technology needs identification and technology solutions formulation
processes also inform Air Force S&T governance, the AFSPS, and the Air Force planning,
programming, and budgeting processes.
2.4. Technology Transition Plans (TTP). Stakeholder organizations participate in technology
transition planning once an S&T solution is deemed necessary to support a MAJCOM/CFLI
capability need and associated Center technology need. For solutions that may become ATDs or
FCCs, formation of an IPT is necessary for transition planning to include development and
execution of the TTP. The IPT membership can be drawn from the existing CCTs as appropriate
 16                                                  AFI61-101_AFSPCSUP_I 23 OCTOBER 2013


and at a minimum, should include the MAJCOM/CFLI, Lead Center and/or PEO, and laboratory.
AFMC and AFSPC, as appropriate, will ensure the establishment of transition planning IPTs and
completion of the associated TTPs once commissioned.
    2.4.1. TTPs document roles and responsibilities of organizational participants in S&T
    programs.
    2.4.2. TTPs for ATDs and FCCs must include the elements listed below in Table 2.1.

Signature Page (with signatories from the appropriate MAJCOM/CFLI, Center or PEO, and laboratory)

    2.4.3. (Added-AFSPC) The CCT lead will ensure development of a Technology Transition
    Plan (TTP) for every S&T solution identified for transition into a new or existing AFSPC
    system or program. The level of detail for each TTP will depend on the maturity and scope
    of the S&T solution as well as the type of solution. For initial planning, and for some types
    of transitions, an annotation in the S&T Needs Database may constitute an adequate TTP.
    An example of this would be where a solution developed is provided to a contractor who
    may, or may not, include it in a program of record. The AFSPC TTP template is available on
    Non-classified      Internet    Protocol    (IP)    Router     Network      (NIPRNET)      at
    https://eis.af.mil/cs/afspcst/default.aspx on Secure Internet Protocol (IP) Router Network
    (SIPRNET)                                                                                  at
    http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/wiki/AFSPC_Science_and_Technology_Development_Pla
    nning.
2.5. Memorandum of Agreement/Memorandum of Understanding. The Air Force will
periodically enter into formal agreements with other Services and outside agencies (e.g.,
DARPA, NASA) to execute S&T projects, conduct demonstrations, or to mature technologies
with the intent to transition to an acquisition or sustainment program. For the purpose of this
instruction, these are referred to as “S&T-related MOAs/MOUs.” Air Force-level MOAs and
MOUs are those MOAs/MOUs requiring HAF-level signature and should be used to document
the commitments and obligations of each organization for an S&T project, both during and after
completion of the S&T activity.
    2.5.1. S&T-related MOAs or MOUs that require HAF signature must be reviewed and
    endorsed by the Air Force S&T Group and Board (reference Chapter 3 of this instruction)
AFI61-101_AFSPCSUP_I 23 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  17


    before submission to the AFROC for validation. Due to rapid timelines associated with
    MOAs/MOUs, coordination and approval of documents may occur electronically.
    2.5.2. All Air Force S&T-related MOAs or MOUs with other Services and non-Air Force
    government agencies or organizations must include the elements listed in Table 2.2 in
    addition to complying with the requirements of DOD Instruction 4000.19, Interservice and
    Intragovernmental Support Agreements, 9 August 1995.

Enumeration of Air Force and external organization roles and responsibilities

Signature page with notation on effective dates and/or duration of the agreement

2.6. Development Planning. DP encompasses the engineering analysis and technical planning
activities that provide the foundation for informed investment decisions on the fundamental path
a materiel development will follow to effectively and affordably meet operational needs. The
relationship between activities supporting both DP and S&T planning are described below:
    2.6.1. Air Force S&T planning activities must support, and take into consideration
    information resulting from, Air Force DP efforts. S&T communities will identify technology
    maturity as well as technology opportunities (e.g., the art of the possible) to inform the
    development and consideration of candidate concepts.
    2.6.2. AFMC or AFSPC, as appropriate, will conduct the necessary DP to assist transition of
    ATDs, FCCs, and Air Force-led JCTDs into acquisition programs. DP communities will
    identify technology needs, technical risk areas, intelligence sensitivity and supportability
    issues (per AFI 14-111), and reliability, availability, maintainability, supportability and data
    rights requirements of candidate concepts to inform S&T planning.
        2.6.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A5X will lead AFSPC DP activities including
        monitoring status and funding of approved AFSPC DP efforts in accordance with the
        process outlined below:
            2.6.2.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) Capability development work reflected in the CFMP
            should inform DP effort requests. The status of the capability gap and the timeline to
            satisfy the gap will drive the type and timing of DP work required. A DP request
            template is completed and submitted to HQ AFSPC/A5X along with an enabling
            concept for the desired capability. The request will be completed using the
            AFMC/AFSPC         DP      Request    template    available     on    SIPRNET       at
18                                      AFI61-101_AFSPCSUP_I 23 OCTOBER 2013

     the applicable product center. Space Superiority capability DP Requests are
     forwarded to SMC/XR (SMC/AD after 1 October 2013). Cyberspace Superiority
     capability DP Requests are forwarded to AFLCMC/XZ with a copy to applicable
     AFLCMC organization (AFLCMC/XZC for cyberspace).
     2.6.2.1.2. (Added-AFSPC) The product center compiles additional data regarding
     the DP effort including: cost, schedule and deliverable DP products that will be
     provided back to requestor (to include Concept Characterization and Technical
     Description (CCTDs)) based on the MAJCOM provided DP Request. The product
     center returns a completed DP Proposal to HQ AFSPC/A5 within 45 days of DP
     request. (T-2)
     2.6.2.1.3. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A5 will lead prioritization/ranking of all
     space and cyberspace DP effort annually, prior to the fall Air Force DP Working
     Group (DPWG). (T-2)
     2.6.2.1.4. (Added-AFSPC) Air Force DPWG is co-chaired by HQ AFSPC/A5X and
     AFLCMC/XZ. The Air Force DPWG develops a prioritized list of DP proposals
     along with recommended allocation of available Requirements, Analysis and
     Maturation (RAM) Program Element (PE) funds; balancing the ability to support the
     Air Force’s strategic objectives against available resources. Air Force DPWG
     recommendations are forwarded to the DP Board for final approval. HQ AFSPC/A5
     and HQ AFMC/A2/5 co-chair the Air Force DP Board and will review and approve
     the final prioritization of DP efforts across the Air Force. Most current copy of Air

farsighted high payoff research that provides the basis for technological progress. Also referred
to as “6.1” or RDT&E Budget Activity Code 1.
Budget Activity—A broad category of activity contained within a specific appropriation.
Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA)—The CBA is the Joint Capabilities Integration and
Development System analysis process. It answers several key questions for the validation
authority prior to their approval: define the mission; identify capabilities required; determine the
attributes/standards of the capabilities; identify gaps/shortfalls; assess operational risk associated
with the gaps/shortfalls; prioritize the gaps/shortfalls; identify and assess potential non-materiel
solutions; provide recommendations for addressing the gaps/shortfalls.
Capability Collaboration Team (CCT)—Established by CFLIs and comprised of subject
matter experts from MAJCOM/CFLIs, Centers, and AFRL. CCTs work collaboratively to fully
understand MAJCOM/CFLI-documented capability needs that may require a materiel solution
and determine if S&T is required for any associated technology needs. The CCTs also
collaboratively formulate potential S&T solutions (e.g., technology development, risk reduction,
or maturation projects) to address the S&T needs previously identified. Once established, CFLIs
may utilize CCTs to identify materiel concepts and produce capability development roadmaps
outlining the timeframe for requirements development, DP, S&T, and acquisition activities.
Capability Gap—The inability to execute a specified course of action. The gap may be the
result of no existing capability, lack of proficiency or sufficiency in an existing capability
solution, or the need to replace an existing capability solution to prevent a future gap (CJCSI
3170.01H, 10 January 2012).
Capability Need (or Need)—see “Capability Requirement”
Capability Requirement (or Requirement)—A capability required to meet an organization’s
roles, functions, and missions in current or future operations. To the greatest extent possible,
capability requirements are described in relation to tasks, standards, and conditions in accordance
with the Universal Joint Task List or equivalent DoD Component Task List. If a capability
requirement is not satisfied by a capability solution, there is also an associated capability gap
which carries a certain amount of risk until eliminated. A requirement is considered to be ‘draft’
or ‘proposed’ until validated by the appropriate authority (CJCSI 3170.01H, 10 January 2012).
Core Function Lead Integrator (CFLI)—SECAF/CSAF-designated leader who serves as the
principal integrators for their assigned SCFs and the corresponding Air Force CFMPs. CFLIs
guide SCF process and SCF-related appropriation priorities by orchestrating the development of

SCF in collaboration with key stakeholders across the Air Force, including MAJCOMs, the Air
Reserve Components, and functional authorities.
Core Function Master Plan (CFMP)—Developed by CFLIs, in collaboration with all key
stakeholders across the Air Force, including MAJCOMs, the Air Reserve Components, and
functional authorities, CFMPs align strategy, operating concepts, and capability development by
SCF, to provide 30-year constructs for enhancing Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global
Power across the range of military operations.
Development Planning (DP)—Encompasses the engineering analysis and technical planning
activities that provide the foundation for informed investment decisions on the fundamental path
a material development will follow to effectively and affordably meet operational needs (DoDI
5134.16, 19 August 2011).
Flagship Capability Concept (FCC)—Similar to an ATD, an FCC is a demonstration of the
maturity and potential of advanced technologies for enhanced military operational capability or
cost effectiveness. FCCs are commissioned by the AFROC with scope, objectives, and
organizational responsibilities defined in a Technology Transition Plan.
Integrated Product Team (IPT)—A multidisciplinary group of people who are collectively
responsible for delivering a defined product or process.
Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTD)—An OSD approved program that seeks
to rapidly and collaboratively demonstrate, assess, and transition solutions to address Combatant
Commanders’, Joint, Interagency, and Coalition problems.
Materiel Solution—A new item (including ships, tanks, self-propelled weapons, aircraft, etc.,
and related spares, repair parts, and support equipment, but excluding real property, installations,
and utilities) developed or purchased to satisfy one or more capability requirements (or needs)
and reduce or eliminate one or more capability gaps (CJCSI 3170.01H, 10 January 2012).
Science and Technology (S&T)—Includes Basic Research, Applied Research, and Advanced
Technology Development.
Science & Technology Group and Board—S&T governance body comprised of HAF and
MAJCOM representation.
Service Core Function (SCF)—SCFs delineate the appropriate and assigned core duties,
missions, and tasks of the Air Force as an organization, responsibility for each of which is
assigned to a CFLI. SCFs express the ways in which the Air Force is particularly and
appropriately suited to contribute to national security. SCFs are an integral aspect of the AFSPS,
and provide the framework for Air Force organizing, training, and equipping efforts.
Technology Executive Officer (TEO)—The individual dedicated to executive management and
supervision of the Air Force S&T portfolio, analogous to a Program Executive Officer. The TEO
shall be appointed and assigned by, and is accountable to, the Air Force Service Acquisition
Executive.
Technology Need—Technology that is unavailable, but potentially attainable, and determined
necessary for ongoing or prospective materiel solution(s) that support a capability need(s).
Technology Solution—Technology project or program, either ongoing or proposed, that address
a technology need(s).

Technology Transition—Process of inserting critical technology into military systems to
provide effective weapons and support system needed by the warfighter to carry out assigned
missions.
Technology Transition Plan (TTP)—Defines scope, objectives, and organizational roles and
responsibilities for an S&T project or program (e.g., ATD, FCC).
