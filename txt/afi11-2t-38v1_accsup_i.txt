        qualification.
1.2. Phases of Training:
     1.2.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). This training is necessary to qualify aircrew
     for duties in the T-38 aircraft. See Chapter 2 for IQT program requirements.
     1.2.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). This training is necessary to qualify
     aircrew for specific unit mission or local area requirements. Training may be incorporated in
     MAJCOM-approved IQT syllabi. See Chapter 3 for MQT requirements.
     1.2.3. Continuation Training (CT). This training is necessary for qualified aircrew to
     maintain their assigned level of proficiency and/or increase flight qualifications. It provides
     minimum ground and flight training event requirements. Squadron commanders will
     designate aircrew members as “experienced” or “inexperienced” for CT purposes. For the
     purposes of this instruction, the wing commander, vice wing commander, OG commander,
     deputy OG commander, squadron commander, and squadron operations officer are
     designated as experienced aircrew. Flight commanders are responsible for scheduling aircrew
     CT missions and flight training objectives for assigned or attached personnel. Using
     MAJCOMs will detail their CT program in their MAJCOM supplement, including a
     MAJCOM definition of “experienced” aircrew.
        1.2.3.(ACC) An experienced T-38 pilot must be certified by the squadron commander on
        the letter of Xs and have 100 hours of FP/IP/MP time in the T-38 if previously or
        currently experienced in another aircraft, or 500 hours of FP/IP/MP time in the T-38 if
        not.
        1.2.3.1. Inexperienced Aircrew. Aircrew not designated as experienced will progress
        through a program managed by the flight commander to develop sound flying skills.
        Flight commanders will tailor each program based on the new aircrew’s performance in
AFI11-2T-38V1_ACCSUP_I 28 MARCH 2013                                                               7


      IQT and past flying experience. No time limit has been established to transition from
      inexperienced to experienced.
      1.2.3.2. CT Meetings. Commanders will direct and supervise periodic CT meetings for
      aircrew members. The purpose of these meetings is to discuss standardization and
      mission-related topics and to increase general knowledge. A cockpit and/or crew resource
      management (CRM) topic or scenario should be discussed in each CT meeting referring
      to CRM core concepts from AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training
      Program. Using MAJCOMs will detail CT meeting requirements in their MAJCOM
      supplement.
      1.2.3.2. (ACC) Units will conduct meetings at least semi-annually. These meetings may
      be conducted in conjunction with other safety or primary MDS specific meetings.
      1.2.3.3. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Training. NVG training is not authorized.
1.3. Training Concepts and Procedures:
   1.3.1. Unless specifically directed, the squadron commander will determine the level of
   supervision required to accomplish in-flight training. If the mission objectives include
   introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, an instructor pilot (IP)
   may be required. If mission objectives require directed supervision, a squadron supervisor
   may be warranted.
   1.3.2. IPs and flight lead-qualified squadron supervisors may allow any pilot to lead limited
   portions of a mission if the pilot has been appropriately briefed. This provision will only be
   used to allow a pilot to practice events in which he or she is already qualified or to help
   determine if a pilot is ready for an upgrade program. In either case, the IP or squadron
   supervisor is responsible for the flight.
   1.3.3. Units will complete training requirements during the appropriate training cycle except
   where specifically excepted. Using MAJCOMs will detail the training cycle in their
   MAJCOM supplement.
   1.3.3.(ACC) The ACC aircrew training cycle is 12 months.
1.4. Training Records and Reports. Units will:
   1.4.1. Maintain aircrew records for individual training and evaluations in accordance with
   (IAW) AFI 11-202, Volumes 1 and 2, and the RDS.
   1.4.2. Maintain formal course or equivalent training records for assigned and attached
   aircrew.
   1.4.3. Maintain documentation for each certification in the individual’s training records, or
   on an AF IMT 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training, or AF Form 4348, USAF
   Aircrew Certifications.
   1.4.3.(ACC) Maintain source documents certifying and/or decertifying pilots for flying and
   flying related qualifications in the individuals training folder for all qualifications maintained
   on the squadron LOXs. Source documentation may include electronic training folders as
   well as scanned and electronically archived versions of paper training folders.
   1.4.4. Prepare and forward training reports IAW MAJCOM directives.

     1.5.9. Flight Surgeon (FS) flying requirements.
     1.5.10. Indoctrination or familiarization flights.
     1.5.11. Other orientation flights.
1.6. Aircrew Graduate Evaluation Program. Refer to the appropriate formal course syllabus
or command directive for aircrew graduate evaluation procedures. The program may be accessed
at https://www.my.af.mil/agepiftprod.
1.7. Progress Reviews. Refer to the appropriate formal course syllabus or command directive
for progress review procedures.
1.8. Fuel Conservation. It is the responsibility of all aircrew to conserve fuel to the maximum
extent possible. Individual crew members and supervisors at all levels will manage aviation fuel
as a limited commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will be considered throughout
all phases of mission planning and execution. Once the objectives of training are complete,
sorties will be terminated at the earliest opportunity. Adherence to average sortie duration will
not be the driving factor of whether to land the aircraft or continue the mission.

1.9. Waivers. HQ AF/A3O-A is the waiver authority for training requirements established by
AFI 11-202, Volume 1. Except as specified elsewhere in this instruction the MAJCOM/A3 is
waiver authority for this instruction.


1.9.(ACC) Waivers. HQ ACC/A3 is approval authority for changes or revisions to this
supplement.
1.9.1. Unless otherwise specified in this supplement, HQ ACC/A3 is the waiver authority. Send
waiver requests through Stan/Eval channels to HQ ACC/A3. The operations group commander
(OG/CC) is the waiver authority for subordinate unit supplements.
   1.9.1. Request waivers through applicable stan/eval channels to MAJCOM/A3, (or
   equivalent). As applicable, MAJCOM/A3s will forward requests to HQ USAF/A3O-A, with
   an information copy to HQ USAF/A3O-AT.
   1.9.2. Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the supplement and
   approved through higher level coordination authority.
1.10. (Added)(ACC) Pilot Utilization Policy:

1.10.1. (Added)(ACC) Commanders will ensure that wing pilots fill only authorized positions
IAW unit manning documents and that pilot status is properly designated. The overall objective
is for pilots to perform operations-related duties. Supervisors may assign pilots to valid, short-
term tasks (escort officer, flying evaluation board [FEB] member, mishap board member, etc.)
but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of pilot tasking, flying proficiency,
currency, and experience.
1.10.2. (Added)(ACC) Duties required by various publications that may be assigned to Aircrew
Position Indicator (API)-1 pilots are weapons and tactics officer, programmer, flying safety
officer, supervisor of flying (SOF), mobility/contingency plans, training (except ARMS
documentation), standardization/evaluation liaison officer (SELO), squadron life support officer,
electronic combat officer, and other duties directly related to flying operations. API-1s will not
be attached to wing staffs or man wing staff positions unless total wing pilot API-1/6 manning is
100 percent or better. Commanders will ensure wing staff pilots (API-6s) perform duties
justified in MAJCOM manpower standards documents and authorized in unit manning
documents (UMD). API-8 and staff personnel on FAC-6 wavers will provide sufficient
availability to meet all lookback and currency requirements, pilot meetings, testing, Duty Officer
(when qualified and on days scheduled to fly), or other flying related duties.

                                            Chapter 2

                       INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING (IQT)

2.1. General. This chapter outlines the IQT program for the T-38. The primary method of
initial qualification is to attend and complete the appropriate formal training course listed in
education and training course announcement (ETCA). Completing the appropriate formal course
satisfies basic qualification training requirements. When attendance is not practical or quotas are
not available, units will request waivers from the MAJCOM/A3 to conduct in-unit qualification
training, using formal school courseware.


2.1. (ACC) General. T-38 IQT will be conducted using either ACC Course T38IQT for the U-2
Companion Trainer Program or ACC Course T38ADAIR for the T-38 Adversary Air program.
Appropriate syllabus tracks, flow programs, and requirements will be followed for those
respective syllabi. AETC formal T-38 qualification courses (T-38 PIT and T-38 IFF IP) with
appropriate T-38C-A/B differences training fulfill qualification requirements.
   2.1.1. Upon completion of the IQT program, aircrew will be qualified IAW AFI 11-202,
   Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program; and AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 2, T-
   38 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
   2.1.2. Except in unusual circumstances, aircrew members undergoing IQT will receive
   ground and flight instruction with minimum interruption and complete training within the
   time specified by the syllabus. For formal training course IQT, failure to complete training
   within the specified time limit requires notifying the gaining wing commander of the
   aircrew’s name and grade, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated completion date.
   2.1.2.1. (Added)(ACC) Multiple-Qualification Candidates. An upgrading T-38 pilot will be
   removed from primary mission design series (MDS) flying duties when the flying portion of
   the T-38 qualification course begins. The pilot will remain in this status until completion of
   or removal from the course. OG/CC is the waiver authority. Note: This restriction only
   applies to initial qualification and IP upgrade.
2.2. Prerequisites. Before entering qualification training, each aircrew member must comply
with the appropriate formal course training prerequisites. In addition, all personnel maintaining
flying status will meet the physical examination; physiological training; and survival, evasion,
resistance, and escape (SERE) training requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 1, before flying.
2.3. Ground Training. Ground training will follow the formal course syllabus flow, but may
be tailored to local conditions and the individual’s background and experience. For in-unit
qualification training, commanders will obtain and use current formal school courseware, if
available.
2.4. Flying Training. Aircrew in IQT will fly under IP supervision until completing the
qualification evaluation unless otherwise specified by their MAJCOM supplement. Formal
course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements for IQT. Additional
training due to student nonprogression is available within the constraints of the formal course
syllabus. Pilots may satisfy MQT and upgrade training requirements during IQT if the
appropriate IP is available and the formal course training allows it.
AFI11-2T-38V1_ACCSUP_I 28 MARCH 2013                                                       11



2.4.(ACC) Flying Training. Pilots may "sandbag" rides in the T-38 IAW syllabus requirements
or as directed by the OG/CC. Pilots are responsible to ensure all flying prerequisites are
complete prior to sandbagging.
2.5. Senior Officer Qualification. Comply with the guidance provided in AFI 11-401, Aviation
Management, and AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
2.6. Flight Surgeon (FS) Training:
   2.6.1. Ground Training. Ground training will include:
       2.6.1.1. Aircraft general review.
       2.6.1.2. Cockpit and/or crew resource management (CRM) training IAW AFI 11-290,
       Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program.
       2.6.1.3. Aircrew flight equipment and procedures training IAW AFI 11-301, Volume 1,
       Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program.
       2.6.1.4. Egress training IAW AFI 11-301, Volume 1.
       2.6.1.5. An instrument and emergency procedure (EP) review with an instructor.
       2.6.1.6. The completion of an FS examination IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
   2.6.2. Flying Training. A FS is qualified to occupy the RCP. An FS will not operate the
   controls unless an IP is at the controls and will not fly during critical phases of flight.
2.7. Requalification Training. An aircrew member is unqualified upon expiration of his or her
qualification evaluation or loss of currency exceeding 6 months (paragraph 4.3). Follow the
requalification guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
2.8. IP Requalification Training. See paragraph 4.4.2.
2.9. Conversion and/or Difference Qualification. Conversion qualification follows the
guidance in this chapter and the formal course conversion syllabus. Difference training is
authorized for pilots converting from the T-38C to the T-38A/B or vice a versa. MAJCOMs will
provide difference training guidance.
2.9.(ACC) Conversion and/or Difference Qualification. T-38C-qualified pilots will complete
an OG/CC-approved difference qualification course prior to flying unsupervised in the T-38A/B,
containing the following minimum requirements:
2.9.1. (Added)(ACC) Ground Training. T-38A/B systems review, with specific focus on
electrical, communications, navigation, and weapons delivery systems. Ground training will
include egress training if the visiting aircrew is not current in the legacy ejection seat.
2.9.2. (Added)(ACC) Device Training. T-38A/B cockpit procedure differences, including
normal and emergency checklist procedures.
2.9.3. (Added)(ACC) Flying Training. Flying training will include two dual sorties with a
qualified ACC T-38A/B IP in the rear cockpit. Pilots must demonstrate proficiency in normal
and emergency patterns and landings, precision and non-precision approaches, and, as
applicable, LOWAT.

                      MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT)

3.1. General. MAJCOM will determine MQT requirements.


3.1. (ACC) General. Pilots will complete locally developed, OG/CC-approved MQT programs
if required to support unique unit missions. An MQT program that culminates in a Mission
Checkride per AFI 11-2T-38 Vol 2 qualifies ACC T-38 pilots to fly ACT. Before performing
instructor duties, IPs will complete a local area orientation sortie (not applicable for IPs trained
locally). This sortie will include normal operations and emergency situations in the local area to
include local area diverts and familiarization with emergency airfields. This sortie will be flown
with an IP familiar with local operating procedures.
AFI11-2T-38V1_ACCSUP_I 28 MARCH 2013                                                            13


                                            Chapter 4

                             CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT)

4.1. General. This chapter outlines minimum ground and flying training requirements for T-38
aircrew CT. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of aircrew training in the basic flying
skills, which ensures safe operation of the aircraft. The second consists of specific mission-
related training required to accomplish the unit's assigned missions or taskings. Taskings may be
locally generated or higher headquarters directed. Using MAJCOMs will define additional
currencies and requirements in their MAJCOM supplement.
4.2. Ground Training. Ground training accomplished during IQT and MQT may be credited
toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished. AFI 11-202,
Volume 1, specifies ground training requirements. Using MAJCOMs may specify additional
ground training requirements in their MAJCOM supplement. Units will track ground training
requirements in ARMS.


4.2. (ACC) Ground Training. Complete the ancillary/ground training listed in Table 4.4.


4.2.1. (Added)(ACC) Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT). This training is not
an evaluation, but is a realistic scenario-based review of T-38 abnormal/emergency procedures
and aircraft systems operations and limitations. SEPT should be accomplished one-on-one, but
small flight-sized groups may be used so all members participate to the maximum extent
possible. BOLDFACE and squadron special interest items should be emphasized.
4.2.1.1. (Added)(ACC) Accomplish SEPT each calendar month. Failure to accomplish by the
end of the month will result in grounding until subsequently completed.
4.2.1.2. (Added)(ACC) Formal course student SEPT may satisfy the monthly SEPT requirement
for the IP who administers the training.
4.2.1.3. (Added)(ACC) Incorporate the following elements into the squadron SEPT program:
4.2.1.3.1. (Added)(ACC) SQ/CC or DO involvement in the selection of a monthly SEPT topic.
4.2.1.3.2. (Added)(ACC) When applicable, integrate T-38 mishaps/incidents into SEPT
scenarios.
4.2.1.3.3. (Added)(ACC) Discuss at least one EP for each phase of flight (takeoff, cruise and
landing) during each session.
4.2.1.3.4. (Added)(ACC) Accomplish two SEPTs each training period with an IP or squadron
supervisor to include minimum fuel and emergency divert training. Note: If multi-qualified,
primary MDS SEPT does not satisfy this requirement.
4.2.2. (Added)(ACC) Anti-G Straining Maneuver (AGSM) Training. Pilots do not require
centrifuge training as long as maneuvering is limited to less than 6.0Gs. Pilots are required to
attend Anti-G Straining Maneuver (AGSM) academic training conducted by a qualified
aerospace physiologist and must be evaluated in the aircraft by a qualified T-38 instructor pilot

on AGSM performance. Aircrew identified as needing additional training will be required to
complete commander-directed training under the provisions of AFI 11-404 Chapter 6.
4.3. Flying Training Currencies and Recurrency:
     4.3.1. Currency. Table 4.1 lists minimum currency requirements for T-38 aircrew. Using
     MAJCOMs may specify additional events or sortie currencies in their MAJCOM supplement.
     If an aircrew member loses a particular currency, he or she may not perform that sortie or
     event except to regain currency.

4.3.1. (ACC) Pilots will maintain the currency requirements in Table 4.1. as applicable. In
addition, the requirements in Table 4.2. will be maintained.

 NOTES:
 1. See paragraph 4.3.3 of this instruction.
 2. Non current pilots will increase their weather minimum by one category. To regain currency,
 supervision level is a current and qualified instructor in the aircraft or element. If the instructor
 is in the aircraft, the instructor’s weather minimums may be used.
 3. Instrument approaches may be flown from either cockpit when simulating instrument
 meteorological conditions (IMC) with a qualified safety observer or during actual IMC.
 MAJCOMs determine limitations when instrument approach currency is expired.
 4. Rear cockpit (RCP) landings update both RCP landing currency and normal landing
 currency. FCP landing currency is good day or night.
 5. Accomplish night landings between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of
 morning civil twilight. To regain RCP night landing currency, three night landings must be
 accomplished from the RCP and the FCP IP must be qualified (not necessarily current) in FCP
 and RCP night landings. See paragraph 4.3.2 of this instruction.

   instructor in the aircraft or element. Training identified as “affects basic aircraft qualification
   (BAQ)” requires regression to an unqualified status until recurrency training is completed.
   Unless otherwise specified in this instruction, supervisory requirements pertaining to
   recurrency may be satisfied in the flight position that offers the best control of the mission, as
   determined by the squadron commander.


   4.3.3. Landing Recurrency. Landing currency is required to maintain BAQ. Loss of
   landing currency over 210 days (225 days experienced) requires requalification training IAW
   AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 2. Loss of landing currency less than 210
   days (225 days experienced) requires the following action: (Note: Timing starts from last
   landing.)
       4.3.3.1. For 31 to 90 Days (46 to 90 Days Experienced). Accomplish at least three
       satisfactory landings with a landing-current IP.
       4.3.3.2. For 91 to 135 Days. Comply with the actions in paragraph 4.3.3.1 and complete
       an instructor-supervised EP and instrument review session (normal, emergency, and
       instrument procedures).
       4.3.3.3. For 136 to 210 Days (to 225 days Experienced). Comply with the actions in
       paragraphs 4.3.3.1 and 4.3.3.2, and complete the qualification written examinations and
       an emergency procedures evaluation (EPE). Documentation of AF 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Qualification, is not required.
4.4. Special Categories:
   4.4.1. Instructor Event or Sortie Currency. If an instructor becomes noncurrent in an
   event or sortie not affecting basic aircraft qualification BAQ, instructor status may be
   retained, but he or she will not instruct in that event or sortie until the required currency is
   regained. Table 4.1 lists supervision required for recurrency training.
   4.4.2. Loss of Instructor Qualification and Requalification. An instructor will be
   unqualified for:
       4.4.2.1. Cause IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
       4.4.2.2. A failed flight evaluation. To regain instructor status, an instructor must
       successfully complete a flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
       4.4.2.3. A failed qualification or instrument written examination. To regain instructor
       status, an instructor must successfully re-accomplish the written examination.
   4.4.3. Demanding Sortie. MAJCOMs will list sorties or events requiring demanding sortie
   currency in their MAJCOM supplement. Aircrew who do not have demanding sortie or event
   currency will not participate in demanding sorties without the proper level of supervision as
   determined by the squadron commander.
   4.4.4. Flight Surgeon (FS). FSs will accomplish CT IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
   4.4.4.(ACC) Must review applicable Emergency Procedures (e.g., ejection) with a T-38 pilot
   once per week (when scheduled) prior to flying that week.
AFI11-2T-38V1_ACCSUP_I 28 MARCH 2013                                                        19


   4.4.5. Higher Headquarters API-8 Aircrew. For training other than that conducted in
   support of a formal inspection, higher headquarters personnel must coordinate with the
   supporting unit as follows:
      4.4.5.1. Aircrew will ensure appropriate ARMS data is maintained and provided IAW
      AFI 11-401.
      4.4.5.2. Units will review the qualifications and currencies of higher headquarters-
      assigned aircrew before authorizing them to fly. Units will evaluate the demands of each
      mission scenario and ensure higher headquarters-assigned aircrew ability and proficiency
      will not be exceeded.
      4.4.5.3. Aircrew will submit qualification and authorization documentation to the
      supporting squadron commander or operations officer prior to flying with that squadron.
4.5. Annual Training Requirements:
   4.5.1. MAJCOMs. Will determine minimum annual requirements. Sorties and events
   accomplished during MQT may be credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in
   which they were accomplished. Before an aircrew member may fly in the new training cycle,
   the OG commander will determine if additional training is required. (Note: Additional
   training may be required, depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency.)
   4.5.1.(ACC) Aircrew members will accomplish sortie and event requirements listed in Table
   4.1., Table 4.2., Table 4.3., in Attachment 2, and Attachment 3. If an aircrew member
   fails to maintain sortie or event requirements, the OG/CC will review the pilot's status to
   determine if additional training is required.
   4.5.2. Squadron Commanders. Will approve profiles for all required CT sorties. Profiles
   will detail the minimum events and currency items to be accomplished on the sortie (for
   example, aircraft handling characteristics [AHC] maneuvers, approaches, or emergency
   patterns and landings).
   4.5.3. Prorating Requirements. Squadron commanders:
      4.5.3.1. May prorate training requirements IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, at the end of the
      training cycle.
      4.5.3.2. Will prorate requirements only to adjust for genuine circumstances of training
      non-availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies.
      4.5.3.3. Will consider newly assigned or qualified pilots who achieve qualification after
      the 15th of the month to be in CT on the first day of the following month.
4.6. Multiple Qualification Requirements. MAJCOMs will specify which sorties and events
flown in other aircraft may be used to satisfy T-38 sortie and event requirements in their
MAJCOM supplement.


4.6.(ACC) Multiple Qualification Requirements. Pilots will satisfy both MDS minimum
sortie/event requirements unless otherwise noted.

4.7. Multiple Qualification Currencies. MAJCOMs will specify which sorties and events
flown in other aircraft may be used to satisfy T-38 currencies in their MAJCOM supplement.


4.7.(ACC) Multiple Qualification Currencies. Pilots will comply with currency requirements
for each aircraft in which they are qualified.
4.8. (Added)(ACC) Functional Check Flight (FCF) Pilots. Also refer to FCF pilot currency
listed in Table 4.2. of this supplement. If an FCF is flown dual, it may be counted as an FCF
flight for both pilots provided a proportionate number of test items are accomplished by each
pilot. If an FCF pilot fails to meet sortie currency, see paragraph 4.5.1. Note: For further
information about the FCF program, see paragraph 5.6. and Attachment 4.

                                           Chapter 5

                          SPECIALIZED TRAINING PROGRAMS

5.1. Overview. This chapter outlines upgrade training programs for special capabilities and
qualifications. These programs are intended to provide a basic starting point and may need to be
modified by the squadron commander, based on the unit’s requirements and the aircrew’s
previous experience, qualifications, and documented performance. Unless governed by a formal
course syllabus, ground and device training for these programs will consist of unit-developed
academics and scenarios. Flight training will be conducted IAW a program approved by the
squadron commander. Using MAJCOMs may specify additional specialized training programs in
their MAJCOM supplement.
5.2. Instructor Upgrade. Follow a MAJCOM-approved formal course syllabus.


5.2.(ACC) Instructor Upgrade. Upon completion, the pilot will be qualified according to AFI
11-401 and AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented, and applicable grading volumes. IP upgrade will
normally be conducted using the ACC T-38 Instructor Pilot Upgrade Training Course (ACC
Course T-38IP) or T-38ADAIR IP syllabus tracks, flow programs, and requirements. An AETC
T-38 instructor pilot course (PIT) or AETC IFF UI may also be used for IP qualification. Multi-
qualified pilots upgrading to T-38 IP will be relieved of primary MDS flying duties when the
flying portion of the T-38 IP course begins. The pilot will remain in this status until completion
of or removal from the course. OG/CC is the waiver authority.


5.2.1. (Added)(ACC) Course prerequisites for Instructor upgrade include:
5.2.1.1. (Added)(ACC) Pilot must be Flight Lead and LLNAV qualified and have 50 hours in T-
38 since initial qualification or requalification. The OG/CC is the waiver authority for IP entry
requirements.
5.2.2. (Added)(ACC) Following satisfactory completion of upgrade requirements, the OG/CC
will interview the upgrading IP and review IP responsibilities, scope of duties, authority, and
philosophy. The SQ/CC will certify the upgrading IP by providing the necessary documentation,
including any restrictions, in appropriate written format.
5.3. RCP Night Landing Qualification Training:
   5.3.1. Spatial Disorientation (SD) Ground Training. SD ground training will consist of
   both an SD briefing and an SD training system demonstration that focus on prevention,
   recognition and recovery. SD briefing requirements are met by currency in the instrument
   refresher course. If an SD training system is not available, ground training may consist of a
   SD briefing only, but special emphasis on SD prevention, recognition and recovery must be
   made during the briefing.
   5.3.2. Flying Training. For initial qualification, an IP qualified in RCP night landings must
   occupy the FCP. The IP being night qualified will accomplish a minimum of three RCP
   landings. Night landings to gain or regain night landing qualification will be accomplished
   between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight.

5.4. Formation and/or Flight Lead Upgrade. Using MAJCOMs will publish formation and/or
flight lead training programs in their MAJCOM supplement. Completion of a formal course
syllabus may satisfy this requirement.
5.4.(ACC) Formation and/or Flight Lead Upgrade. Refer to Attachment 2 or Attachment
3, as applicable. The T-38 ADAIR FLUG program will be at the direction of the OG/CC.
5.5. Low Altitude Training Upgrade. Using MAJCOMs will publish low altitude upgrade
programs in their MAJCOM supplement. Completion of a formal course syllabus may satisfy
this requirement.
5.5.(ACC) Low Altitude Training Upgrade. T-38 ADAIR CAT-1 Low-Altitude Training
(LOWAT)-qualified pilots may conduct low-level navigation training and mission-oriented
operations (aerial attack or threat reactions) associated with air combat tactics (ACT) down to
CAT-1 LOWAT minimums (500 feet AGL). T-38 CTP pilots may execute low-level navigation
training down to CAT-1 LOWAT minimums, but may not conduct mission-oriented operations
associated with ACT.
5.6. Functional Check Flight (FCF) Training. MAJCOMs will publish FCF pilot training
requirements in their MAJCOM supplements.
5.6.(ACC) Functional Check Flight (FCF) Training. Units will train and certify FCF pilots as
follows:
5.6.1. (Added)(ACC) Prerequisites.
5.6.1.1. (Added)(ACC) FCF pilots will have a minimum of 750 total flying hours and 200 IP or
FP hours in the T-38, or 650 total hours and 300 IP or FP hours in the T-38.
5.6.1.2. (Added)(ACC) FCF IPs must have at least 4 months of experience conducting T-38
FCFs. The FCF section chief will consider the number of FCFs actually flown before
recommending FCF pilots for FCF IP status. FCF IPs will train new FCF pilots and administer
FCF certification flights according to local unit training programs.
5.6.2. (Added)(ACC) Ground Training. Ground training will include a review of applicable
technical orders and publications, including, as a minimum, AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equipment

AFI11-2T-38V1_ACCSUP_I 28 MARCH 2013                                                           23



5.8.1. (Added)(ACC) General. LASDT certification is required for all flights on MTRs and
flights conducted at or below 1,000 feet AGL in MOAs, restricted airspace, or warning areas. T-
38 IPs are certified to fly and instruct low-altitude navigation and formation down to 500 feet
AGL upon completion of ACC Syllabus T-38IP or T-38 PIT.

5.8.2. (Added)(ACC) Certification and Currency. LASDT certification incrementally qualifies a
pilot to fly LLNAV down to 500 feet AGL. Currency is required for operations on MTRs and
operations at or below 1,000 feet AGL. LASDT-1 and LASDT-2 can be combined for
previously qualified CAT-1 LOWAT pilots at the Sq/CC’s discretion. LASDT certification
levels are as follows:

5.8.2.1. (Added)(ACC) LASDT-1. Qualifies a pilot to perform unsupervised single-ship
operations at or above 1,000 feet AGL.

5.8.2.2. (Added)(ACC) LASDT-2. Qualifies a pilot to perform unsupervised single-ship
operations down to 500 feet AGL.

5.8.2.3. (Added)(ACC) LASDT-3. Qualifies a pilot to perform unsupervised formation
operations down to 500 feet AGL.

5.9. (Added)(ACC) Night Qualification. Prior to flying unsupervised at night, pilots will
complete an OG/CC-developed night qualification program. The program should address night-
time considerations for aircraft lighting, spatial disorientation, landings and emergency
procedures. Record night qualification training information in the individual’s training folder
and annotate on the Letter of Qualifications. For operations between sunset and sunrise, the Pilot
in Command must be current and qualified (as applicable) for night operations.

                             T-38 Adversary Air Program (F-22)
A2.1. General. The T-38 is used to support adversary air requirements of the F-22 program.
A2.2. Eligibility Requirements. Participants will have completed the Introduction to Fighter
Fundamentals (IFF) course. Pilots assigned T-38 Adversary Air from T-38C SUPT will
complete AETC IFF syllabus B/F-V5A-K, Track E (F-22). The number of multi-qualified
fighter pilots will be determined by the OG/CC. Additionally, participants from outside the
owning Wing (e.g., attached rated staff) will be on API-8 active flying status or on an API-4
Flying Activity Code (FAC)-6 waiver per AFI 11-401. Waiver authority resides with ACC/A3.
A2.3. Training Program. ACC T-38 Adversary Air Course (T-38ADAIR) or a combination of
AETC PIT or ACC T-38 Initial Qualification Training (T38IQT) and OG/CC MQT.
A2.3.1. Formation Training. Formation training and checkout may be accomplished during
either IQT or MQT as part of a syllabus sortie. Completion of the formation sortie will be
documented on the gradesheet and in the training folder.
A2.3.2. T-38 Adversary Air Instructor:
A2.3.2.1. General. T-38 Adversary Air instructor pilots must have completed either AETC PIT
with OG/CC-approved Adversary Air IP top-off or the ACC T38ADAIR IP course. Upon
completion, the pilot will be qualified to instruct all phases of T-38 training including:
A2.3.2.1.1. T-38 Initial Qualification Training (ACC T38IQT).
A2.3.2.1.2. T-38 Instructor Upgrade Course (ACC T38IP).
A2.3.2.1.3. T-38 Adversary Air course (ACC T-38ADAIR).
A2.3.2.1.4. OG/CC MQT Program.

program and the local OG/CC T-38 FE upgrade training program and support the Group by:
A2.3.3.2. Conducting T-38 periodic instrument/qualification and mission flight evaluations.
A2.4. Other Duties Requiring T-38 Qualification:
A2.4.1. Operations Group and Squadron Supervisors. These pilots usually are in Top-3 or flight
commander positions in the OG or flying squadrons. They fly the T-38 to supervise the conduct
of flying operations within the units (F-22 and T-38 operations). When an F-22 pilot that is not
multi-qualified in the T-38 is acting as Top-3, an experienced T-38 pilot Duty Officer must be
available in the F-22 squadron (or in the T-38 ADAIR OPS building monitoring unit ops radio
frequency(s)) to provide T-38-specific expertise and support to the Top-3.
 A2.5. Sortie Requirements. The annual sortie requirements are depicted in Table A2.1. and
Table A2.2.
A2.5.1. Failure to meet 1-month look back requires a review of 3-month look back. No further
action is required if the pilot’s 3-month look back is met. If 3-month look back is not met the
pilot will be placed on probation status. If the pilot makes the monthly sortie look back on the
following month, he is removed from probation status. If the pilot fails to make look back on the

Notes:
1. For IPs, accomplishing or instructing the event from either cockpit will update currency.
2. Currency may only be regained from the FCP with an IP or qualified and current squadron
supervisor in the aircraft or in the element.
3. Currency may be regained by flying a non-demanding sortie or a demanding sortie with an IP
or qualified and current squadron supervisor in the aircraft or in the element.
4. To regain currency, the supervision level is the IP or squadron supervisor qualified and
current in the event, in the aircraft or element.
5. LOWAT currency is required after low-altitude step-down training (LASDT) certification to
fly low-altitude tactical employment (other than low-level navigation/formation) sorties below
1,000 feet above ground level (AGL).
6. Definitions of demanding and non-demanding sorties:
       a. Demanding sortie – Sorties that task the pilot to the extent that flying frequency and
       continuity are most critical. Authorized sorties/events requiring demanding mission
       currency are: (D)ACT and LOWAT (below 1,000 feet AGL), SQ/CCs may add
       sorties/events to the demanding sortie list, depending on unit tasking and the individual's
       capabilities.
       b. Non-demanding Sortie - A sortie that provides the aircrew with the opportunity to
       regain basic flying proficiency without excessively tasking those skills unused during the
       nonflying period. Authorized sorties/events flown for/on a non-demanding sortie include
       instruments, AHC, formation, and low level navigation at or above 1000 feet AGL.
       SQ/CCs may delete sorties/events from this non-demanding sortie list, depending on unit
       tasking and the individual's capabilities.

                           U-2 COMPANION TRAINER PROGRAM
A3.1. General. The T-38 is used to support the proficiency, instrument, evaluation, off-station
training (OST) requirements, and other mission support duties as directed by the wing (WG) and
operations group (OG) leadership.
A3.1.1. Basic Proficiency. The primary purpose of T-38 flying in the U-2 program is to provide
a level flying proficiency and continuity due to limited number of training sorties and hours
available in the U-2.
A3.1.2. Instrument Training. The majority of instrument training for U-2 pilots is accomplished
in the T-38 because the U-2 is not equipped to effectively simulate instrument conditions.
A3.1.3. Pilot Evaluation. Because of limited U-2 training resources, pilot flying evaluations are
administered in the T-38. This provides supervisors with first-hand knowledge of pilot
capability.
A3.1.4. OST. Due to complex U-2 launch and recovery procedures and the multiple TDY
locations required by the U-2 mission, the T-38 provides valuable training in strange-field
procedures.
A3.2. Eligibility Requirements. T-38 pilots will be on active flying status assigned to an API-
1/6/8 U-2 flying position. Selected pilots assigned to API-6/8 flying positions not flying the U-2
must be approved by HQ ACC/A3C. The OG/CC must request approval for each pilot by name
and position via message to HQ ACC/A3C (info to HQ ACC/A3 and NAF/A3). Staff pilots will
not be entered into the flying portion of the T-38 program until approval is granted.
A3.3. T-38 Support and Qualifications. There are two T-38 qualifications required to meet the
instructor, upgrade, supervisory, and evaluation support needs of the U-2 program. They are:
A3.3.1. T-38 Instructor:
A3.3.1.1. General. These are pilots who have completed a MAJCOM-approved IP upgrade
program and are qualified to instruct all phases of T-38 training, to include:
A3.3.1.1.1. ACC syllabus course T38IQT.
A3.3.1.1.2. T-38 Instructor Upgrade Course--ACC Syllabus Course T38IP.
A3.3.1.1.3. Continuation Training upgrade programs.
A3.3.2. Basic T-38 Qualified:
A3.3.2.1. General. The basic T-38 qualified pilot is checked out in order to build flying
experience. This qualification allows a pilot to perform basic instruments, AHC, transition,
cross-country, and contact flights. With CT upgrade training, the pilot is qualified to fly
formation and LLNAV.
A3.3.2.1.1. Basic qualification allows pilots to fly traffic pattern stalls and all AHC
demonstrations described in AFMAN 11-250V1 except for low-speed stability exercises and full
aft-stick stalls, which require an IP. The required AHC sorties stipulated in Table 4.3. will be
flown with an IP.

A3.3.2.2. Training Program. Use ACC syllabus course T38IQT for training.
A3.4. Other Duties Requiring T-38 Qualification:
A3.4.1. T-38 FE or SELO. These pilots are assigned to OG/OGV (FE) or to individual flying
squadrons (SELO) and maintain CTP IP qualification. Their primary duties are to administer
initial instrument/qualification (I/Q) and periodic I/Q flight evaluations.
A3.4.2. OG and SQ Supervisors. These pilots are usually in Top-3 and flight commander
positions. They provide the basic supervision of flying operations within both the T-38 and U-2
squadrons.
A3.5. Continuation Training. Pilots assigned or attached to the U-2 program are upgraded in
the T-38 in phases. One phase of training is not necessarily a prerequisite of another phase. This
training is accomplished according to 9 RW T-38 Continuation Training program. The
objectives of these courses are to produce pilots proficient and qualified in T-38 formation,
LLNAV, and night.
A3.6. Sortie Requirements. The annual sortie requirements are depicted in Table A3.1.
