Introduction_______________________________________________________i


      Volume 6, Supervision and Training, Qualification Training Package (QTP) contains
modules on orienting new personnel, evaluating performance and performance standards,
scheduling work assignments, resolving problems, writing job descriptions, conducting training,
and monitoring the effectiveness of training. This QTP is designed to enhance 5- and 7-skill
level OJT of dental laboratory personnel. The 4Y0X2 Career Development Courses may be used
to compliment the training references listed in each module. All QTPs are intended to be used
by trainees, trainers, supervisors, and task certifiers. Before initiating any training you should
review your responsibilities—as a supervisor/trainer—for conducting on-the-job training (OJT)
per AFI 36-2201, Volume 3, Air Force Training Program On The Job Training Administration.

      Six months after the apprentice graduates, you should receive a survey that allows you to
evaluate the in-residence apprentice course. This poll is a valuable tool, your feedback is critical
to improving our 3 level course and your career field. Subsequently, 3-skill level training
provides a foundation for your OJT

       QTPs are designed to help you conduct and evaluate your field training. Once you begin
upgrade training you are required to use the QTPs. QTPs provide continuity to the trainee’s
upgrade training and are divided into the following volumes: 1) General Dental Laboratory
Experience; 2) Fixed Prosthodontics; 3) Treatment and Orthodontic Appliances, Complete and
Removable Partial Dentures; 4) Dental Laboratory Administration; 5) Medical Material; and 6)
Supervision and Training. The QTP modules were written to assist you in preparing for and
conducting training. You must use the QTP modules for training when the STS task is a core task
(minimum qualification for the specialty). Each module segments the major tasks into teachable
elements. Your goal is to provide enough training and guidance so trainees can do all task
related steps, without assistance, and produce an appliance that meets local requirements for
speed and accuracy. QTPs also aid OJT task certifiers in evaluating the trainee’s demonstrated
performance. If you have local training requirements not covered by a QTP module you should
develop “steps in performance” and “performance checklists” that support and standardize those
tasks.

      Accompanying each volume of QTPs is a qualification training progress record. This
QTP record serves as a document to record the date the trainee completes each module. Every
person in qualification/upgrade training must have this QTP progress record filed in their OJT
folder. Use and annotation of this progress record is similar to current OJT documentation.
When you are satisfied the trainee meets standards, as prescribed in the QTP performance
checklist, you must document each task completion date in the “date completed” column in the
QTP progress record. If a person is being recertified on a task that is supported by a QTP you
must use that module to complete the recertification process. You should file the QTPs in an
accessible location.

       Typically, you will manage each module by first, training the tasks and then, evaluating
performance. Your local steps in performance may vary from the method listed in the QTP
module. If this is the case, you are authorized to make changes to the first half of each module,
(i.e. steps in task performance); however, the “performance checklist” is considered a standard
and cannot be altered. You may train each QTP volume/module in any sequence; however,


                                                 ii
Introduction____________________________________________________ii

when conducting training use an organized and methodical approach. This will reduce your
training time and enhance your efforts.
       For effective use of this QTP, conduct training in the following manner:
           1. Review the procedures in each module with the trainee.
           2. Direct the trainee to review the training references listed to prepare for task
               performance.
           3. Review the steps in task performance with the trainee, allowing enough time to
               adequately train each step (some modules may take longer to teach).
           4. Evaluate the trainee’s work at each critical step—using the performance checklist
               at this point will be helpful.
           5. Fifth, evaluate the trainee’s performance and provide feedback on any areas for
               improvement.
           6. Finally, when the trainee has successfully completed the task you must document
               and initial both the STS and the QTP progress record. If the trainee does not
               accomplish the module, conduct follow-up instruction until the trainee successfully
               completes the task.

      The QTP project goal of the 381st Training Squadron, Sheppard AFB TX, is to publish a
useable document for trainers and trainees. You are encouraged to write-in changes or revisions
to the QTPs. A corrections/improvements letter is located on the last page of each QTP volume.
