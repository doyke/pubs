     Affairs (78 ABW/PA). If approved, an AF Form 332 will be submitted by the requesting
     organization to 78th Civil Engineer Group (78 CEG) for location and construction by
     contract. Requesting unit will be responsible for all costs of construction and maintenance.
     1.2. The 78th Civil Engineer Squadron (78 CES) is responsible for maintenance of 78
     ABW/PA-managed marquees as physical property on RAFB. This includes funding of

     marquees. Other units managing marquees are responsible for funding of service and repair
     contracts.

     achievements of people on base, retirements, farewells, or other similar activities.
     2.2. In general, FPCON and INFOCON, and welcome announcements will receive top
     priority, followed by announcements about base-wide activities and programs. Requests
     other than these will be honored on a space-available basis.

     ABW/PA policies.
