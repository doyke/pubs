SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Changes include
updating system names to allow for better understanding of the subject matter. A low-use trailer
definition was incorporated with a reference for low-use trailer procedures. Also, updates were
made to office symbols and office names.

1. Obtaining Bulk Quantities. Bulk quantities of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen will be
obtained through commercial contract for storage and issues on an “as required” basis.
NOTE: Dispensing of liquid oxygen/nitrogen and verification of fuels availability to meet issue
requirements is accomplished as prescribed by the fuels management contract.
2. Accounting For Bulk Quantities
     2.1. Accounting of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen will be maintained by using the
     simultaneous receipt and issue procedures and issuing it to the using organizations on a
     prorated basis (reference AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, USAF Supply Manual, part three,
     chapter 4).
     2.2. On receipt and acceptance of liquid oxygen or liquid nitrogen from commercial contract
     supplier the Base Fuels Contractor will:
        2.2.1. Make sure that proper receipting of the Department of Defense (DD) Form 250,
        Material Inspection & Receiving Report, is accomplished. The Fuels Flight Chief or
        designated representative will sign as receiver in block 22.
        2.2.2. The Base Fuels Contractor will charge each using organization issues with the
        appropriate percentage of the receipt as determined through a semi-annual calculation of
        percentage of oxygen servicing trailers filled at Bldg 1052. A contractor representative
        will sign each issued DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document, and forward a
        copy to proper organization and Document Control (72 LRS/LGRMCC). The contractor
        will also forward a DD Form 1348-1A receipt signed by the Fuels Flight Chief or
        designated representative to LGRMCC.
        2.2.3. Upon completion of processing, the Base Fuels Contractor shall forward a copy of
        the DD Form 250, a copy of the DD Form 1348-1A receipt, a copy of the delivery ticket
        and a copy of the call register to OC-ALC/FMFL. The contractor shall also forward the
        original call register, a copy of delivery ticket, a copy of DD Form 250 and a copy of DD
        Form 1348-1A receipt to OC-ALC/PKOAA.
NOTE: Each using organization will furnish the Base Fuels Contractor by letter, the Base
Supply Organizational Account Code and shop codes for charging liquid oxygen and liquid
nitrogen and the name, functional address symbol and telephone extension of an authorized
representative and alternate.
3. Minimizing Product Losses.
     3.1. Organizational dispensing carts will be filled Monday-Friday at 1000 hours.
     Organizations should bring carts requiring filling to Bldg. 1054 before 1000 hours. Filled
     carts can be picked up after 1200 hours. EMERGENCY issues on swing, graves and
     weekend shifts shall be on an on-call basis (Notify the Fuels Service Center, 739-5066).
     Carts with more than 25 gallons will not be filled under Emergency issue procedures.
     3.2. Organizations must ensure that the only carts filled are the carts required for aircraft
     service. Active carts should be kept to a minimum to prevent excessive losses. Carts should
     only be filled when less than 25 gallons remains in the cart.
     3.3. Definition-a low use trailer is one which was not used to service aircraft in the past 7
     calendar days.
TINKERAFBI23-205 18 AUGUST 2011                                                                  3


   3.4. T.O. 42B6-1-1 contains procedures that must be followed when a low use trailer is
   identified. The organization responsible for servicing the aircraft must utilize the Air Force
   Technical Order (AFTO) Form 134, Aviator Breathing Oxygen Servicing Trailer Log
   (Liquid/Gaseous), to identify low use carts, document aircraft servicing operations and
   actions taken when carts are identified as low use.
   3.5. Base Fuels personnel will review the AFTO Form 134 to insure that aircraft servicing is
   documented on the form. If the AFTO Form 134 does not contain aircraft servicing data or
   can be identified as low use, Base Fuels personnel will not fill the cart.
4. Qualification of Equipment Operators.
   4.1. Base organizations will not let personnel use liquid oxygen servicing equipment if they
   have not completed an appropriate course of instruction, which covers operations of the
   equipment and its safe use.
   4.2. Owning organizations will provide personnel to assist in filling liquid oxygen and liquid
   nitrogen servicing carts.
5. Quality Control and Testing Requirements. The provisions of T.O. 42B6-1-1, Quality
Control of Aviators Breathing Oxygen, govern quality checks (Section IV also covers Hazards
and Safety Precautions of Liquid Handling).
6. Inspection And Maintenance Of Equipment:
   6.1. Organizations using liquid oxygen servicing trailers will:
       6.1.1. Make sure that inspection and maintenance to liquid oxygen servicing trailers are
       performed according to applicable 37C2 series T.O.s (Titled Liquid Oxygen/Nitrogen
       Storage and Transfer Tanks).
       6.1.2. Assign or designate an operator to do daily and weekly inspections, normal
       operator maintenance and document the AFTO Form 244, Industrial/Support Equipment
       Record. Carts must be signed off for pre-operational inspection by the owning
       organization. Carts that have not been signed off on the current or previous duty day or
       carts with a red “X” (meaning there is a discrepancy with the cart and it’s initiated by
       whoever discovers such) will not be filled.
       6.1.3. Deliver trailer to Bldg. 1051, Area A, for accomplishment of periodic inspection
       and maintenance (A 90 day and 360 day periodic inspection).
NOTE: Maintenance of the trailer chassis will not be included in the periodic inspection since
such maintenance is governed by requirements set up for wheeled vehicles (Periodic inspection
workcards-T.O. 37C2-8-116WC-1).

    6.1.4. Make sure that the requirements in T.O. 42B6-1-1, paragraphs 3-26b, c, d, e, and f
    are met.
    6.1.5. Maintain AFTO Form 134, Aviator Breathing Oxygen Servicing Trailer Log
    (Liquid/Gaseous). Liquid oxygen carts will not be filled without proper accounting of
    issues annotated on the AFTO Form 134.
