SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This revision incorporates substantive changes and numerous additions to Air Force Instruction (AFI)
32-1043. These changes revise the requirements for managing, operating, and maintaining aircraft arrest-
ing systems. This revision adds a table of contents and changes aircraft arresting systems logistics and
technical management responsibilities from San Antonio Air Logistics Center to Warner Robins Air
Logistics Center (WR-ALC). It changes major commands’ (MAJCOM) reporting requirements and clari-
fies qualification criteria for military and other personnel engaged in aircraft arresting system activities. It
adds general information on operations and maintenance of aircraft arresting systems, provides inspection
information, certification criteria, certification weights and speeds, criteria for evaluating maintenance
crews, and standard phraseology for communication with air traffic control (ATC) and ground control. It
adds guidelines for constructing and installing hook-cable tie-downs. This revision also adds standard
hand signals for maintenance crewmembers and aircrew, and instructions for installation of ultra-high
molecular weight (UHMW) polyethylene panels under aircraft arresting system cables. Metric dimen-
sions are included in this revision. Generally, these are rounded conversions of inch-pound units. Excep-
tions are made in cases where specific dimensions or values have the potential to impact aircraft safety. In
this case, metric units are soft conversions of inch-pound units. The location and configuration reporting
requirements for aircraft arresting systems given in Attachment 4 do not include metric conversions
because DOD reports airfield data in inch-pound units. System performance characteristics provided in
Attachment 2 are given in the units provided by the original equipment manufacturers and do not include
metric conversions.
(USAFE) This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
deletes MA1A, textile brake model 60.9.9.C, and BAK-13 support and maintenance; deletes fire depart-
ment crew chief requirement to perform daily inspections; deletes Chief of Supply responsibilities;
changes HQ USAFE/A7CCE to HQ USAFE/A7AO; changes 38 CTS/CEX to 86th Construction and
Training Squadron, Readiness and Training Flight (86 CTS/CEX).

           e-mail when spare parts are required. Spare parts provided by the 86 CTS/CEXD is limited
           to AAS purchase tapes and Due-In-From-Maintenance (DIFM) supply items. A follow-up
           letter or message is required within two days when the tapes or DIFM items are requested
           by telephone. If the item requested is not available, order the requested part through base
           supply with the highest possible priority. The 86 CTS/CEXD does not plan to provide
           tapes or spare parts for War Reserve Materiel (WRM) MAAS units on USAFE bases or
           storage locations. The civil engineering or maintaining organization should budget for the
           maintenance and upkeep of WRM MAAS units to include BAK-12 absorber change-out at
           the 10-year maintenance requirement. NOTE: If 86 CTS/CEXD are to conduct a 10-year
           overhaul on WRM MAAS, funds can be transferred from WRM to 86 CTS/CEXD account
           to pay for the overhaul or a parts listing can be forward to WRM for advance ordering in
           preparation of overhaul.

        1.3.3.15.13.2. (Added-USAFE) Ensure the correct T.O. be used to identify parts. Provide
        T.O. number, figure/index, part number, nomenclature, quantity required and AAS serial
        number. When DIFM assets are involved, ensure the repairable asset is shipped within 5
        work days priority cargo to 86 CTS/CEXD, account FB5612. All XD2 items must have
        duplicate DD Form 1577-2, Unserviceable (Reparable) Tag Materiel and AFTO Form
        350, Reparable Item Processing Tag properly completed. NOTE: Any item that has been
        drained and purged must be labeled as such. All XF3 items must have a DD Form 1577-1,
        Unserviceable (Condemned) Label - Materiel, and the completed bottom portion of an
        AFTO Form 350.
        1.3.3.15.13.3. (Added-USAFE) Establish local procedures to monitor status or require-
        ments levied against the FB5612 account.
     1.3.3.15.14. (Added-USAFE) Establishes a bench stock level of items needed to maintain
     each aircraft arresting system at your location. Upon request, 86 CTS/CEXD will supply min-
     imum suggested bench stock listings for each type of AAS in use. These part listings are con-
     sidered minimum and others may be added as necessary. Review bench stock due-outs for
     critical items for an adequate supply stockage objective; i.e., demand level or special levels. If
     stockage objectives are deemed inadequate, special levels should be initiated or increased as
     appropriate. When adequate supply levels exist and bench stock effectiveness is deemed
     unsatisfactory, follow procedures outlined in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 25,
     Bench Stock Support. Immediate requirements (such as AAS pendants) that cannot be satisfied
     from bench stock should be ordered using the force activity designator (FAD) of the flying unit
     being supported. In no case will the supply FAD be lower than the FAD of aircraft sup-
     ported. Items listed on 86 CTS suggested bench stock listings will not normally be provided
     by the 86 CTS. 86 CTS will normally provide tapes and DIFM supply items for permanently
     installed AAS. Special levels are established to provide adequate materials to immediately
     support the base mission. Once established, material control and the shop supervisor must take
     corrective action to ensure special levels are “on hand” or “on order” with positive status. Sta-
     tus must be verified periodically with base supply to find out that materials are physically “on
     hand” or “on order” with satisfactory status. If status is unsatisfactory, submit a written request
     for improved status or to upgrade requisition due in priority to the chief of supply.
     1.3.3.15.15. (Added-USAFE) Works closely with base traffic management office (TMO) to
     ensure AAS spares shipments marked “For The Base Civil Engineer” are placed in the hands
     of BCE personnel and not in supply channels.
     1.3.3.15.16. (Added-USAFE) BCE technicians assist 86 CTS during SAVs and technical
     assistance visits. Forward a formal reply to all noted deficiencies identified during these visits
     within 30 days to Commander, 86 CTS/CC, UNIT 3335, APO AE 09094, with information
     copy to HQ USAFE/A7AO, UNIT 3050 BOX 10, APO AE 09094. Include status of corrective
     action, problem areas, and estimated completion dates of open items. Corrective actions
     should begin immediately. All AASs which receive an unsatisfactory rating will be
     re-inspected within 90 days after receipt of a formal reply to deficiencies noted.
     1.3.3.15.17. (Added-USAFE) Ensures AAS are obstruction lighted and marked according to
     AFI 32-1042, Standards for Marking Airfields and AFI 32-1044, Visual Air Navigation Sys-
     tems.

          RCS: HAF-CE (M&AR) 7150 to 86 CTS/CEXD, UNIT 3335, APO AE 09094, and Director
          of Installations and Mission Support (HQ USAFE/A7CC), UNIT 3050 BOX 10, APO AE
          09094, (as prescribed in AFI 32-1043), and a USAFE Form 300 after each arrestment to 86
          CTS/CEXD and HQ USAFE/A7AO.
          1.3.3.15.19. (Added-USAFE) Provides for storage, maintenance, repair, installation, and
          operation of MAASs located at Main Operating Bases (MOB), Collocated Operating Bases
          (COB) and forward operating locations (FOL). The MAAS maintenance and repair may be
          performed either in-house or by contract; however, initial certification engagement checks will
          only be performed by United States (U.S.) military personnel. MAAS designated for a COB or
          FOL must be stored at the support MOB if space is not available at the COB or FOL. Waivers
          for non-WRM MAAS can be granted by HQ USAFE/A7AO; waivers for WRM MAAS must
          be submitted to Directorate of Logistics, Installations and Mission Support, USAFE War

   1.6.1. (Added-USAFE) Establishes operating levels and identifies requirements to the chief of sup-
   ply (FB5612 account) Ramstein AB GE, for items to support these levels. NOTE: The 86 CTS logis-
   tics section will normally maintain bench stock items to support the 86 CTS depot.
16                                                         AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


     1.6.2. (Added-USAFE) Accomplishes annual inventory and levies demands against the FB5612
     account to ensure the availability of material to satisfy requirements generated by bases supporting
     BAK-12, Textile AAS, BAK-14, or MAAS.
     1.6.3. (Added-USAFE) Processes requirements from USAFE bases as follows:
        1.6.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Check for availability of spares requested and validate requirements
        with the 86 CTS quality assurance section.
        1.6.3.2. (Added-USAFE) If a part is available, Resource Management Office (86 CTS/CER)
        logistics will issue the item from the appropriate bill of materiel (BOM) and place the item in
        holding for 86 CTS/CEXD pick-up and shipment.
1.7. (Added-USAFE) Headquarters USAFE unique Policy.
     1.7.1. (Added-USAFE) The command is responsible for program management of AAS. In USAFE,
     the AAS program management is delegated to 86 CTS. Installation commanders designate the respon-
     sibility for the maintenance and operation of the AAS to base civil engineers according to AFI
     32-1043 and this supplement.
     1.7.2. (Added-USAFE) Installations. Nonstandard AAS installations that do not meet UFC
     3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design, Standard Facility Requirements, or applicable
     technical order (TO) criteria require a waiver. Submit waiver requests with justification to HQ
     USAFE/A7AO, UNIT 3050 BOX 10, APO AE 09094, and HQ USAFE/A3TO, UNIT 3050 BOX 15,
     APO AE 09094, for processing (See AFI 32-1043).
     1.7.3. (Added-USAFE) Certification. Before operational use, 86 CTS/CEXD performs permanent
     and semi-permanent AAS certifications when an AAS is initially placed in service or when runway
     deck sheaves/fairlead beams are installed. Base-level AAS technicians perform subsequent annual
     re-certification engagements for semi-permanent and permanent AAS and may certify MAAS sup-
     porting real world contingency operations. Test the entire system with an aircraft not committed for
     flight, according to AFI 32-1043, and this supplement. Check the integrity of the anchoring system
     and the tape tracking on the sheaves following the test. All operational AAS (excluding Textile Brake)
     not having had an aircraft arrestment during the past 12 months must be engaged by an aircraft
     (according to AFI 32-1043, paragraph 2.3.). On MAAS or Expeditionary BAK-12 installations sup-
     porting Joint Chiefs of Staff, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and USAFE exercises or
     deployments involving U.S. and or NATO aircraft, the AAS installation crew will coordinate to cer-
     tify the installed system with an engagement by an aircraft not committed for flight before flying
     begins. If the certification engagement cannot be accomplished, the deployed commander must notify
     HQ USAFE/A7AO and HQ USAFE/A3TV for waiver or instructions.
     1.7.4. (Added-USAFE) Technical Assistance. The 86 CTS/CEXD/CEXTI provides technical assis-
     tance in all phases of AAS installation, certification, operations and maintenance. The 86 CTS can
     provide familiarization and refresher training to all USAFE AAS technicians. A formal request should
     be submitted to the HQ USAFE/A7AO, UNIT 3050 BOX 10, APO AE 09094. Funding is the respon-
     sibility of requesting unit.
     1.7.5. (Added-USAFE) Resetting the AAS. The number of airborne aircraft, their fuel status,
     weather situation, runway condition and alternate aircraft status may override the need to close the
     runway for resetting the AAS. When an AAS cannot be reset due to power failure or malfunction after
     an engagement, remove the hook cable (pendant) from the runway and pull tapes to the shoulders until
AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                              17


  repairs are completed. When the pendant is removed from the runway, notify Air Traffic Control
  through the Airfield Manager and extinguish aircraft arresting gear warning marker (moon marker)
  for the out of service AAS.
  1.7.6. (Added-USAFE) MAAS Operations. Use the MAAS at a MOB or a collocated operating base
  (COB) as a war reserve materiel (WRM) supplement to support USAFE/NATO/Joint Chiefs of Staff
  (JCS) exercises, on alternate launch and recovery surfaces (ALRS), and on main runways. Do not use
  it as a long term/semi-permanent replacement for permanently installed AAS. MAAS and Expedition-
  ary BAK-12 can not remain in service more than 365 days without removal and inspection of the
  anchoring components. MOB Wing Commanders control the use of their MAAS and may direct its
  use to temporarily replace a permanently out of service AAS. MAAS stored at the 86 CTS Depot may
  be used to temporarily replace an out of service AAS or MAAS and to support exercises.
     1.7.6.1. (Added-USAFE) Annual certification engagements for MAAS in storage are not
     required. In accordance with AFI 32-1043, perform certification engagement on all installed
     MAAS before use to ensure reliability.
  1.7.7. (Added-USAFE) MAAS Maintenance. Maintain MAAS as prescribed in TO 35E8-2-10-1,
  Operation and Maintenance Instruction (MAAS). Contractors performing MAAS maintenance will
  adhere to the requirements found in the statement of work (SOW). Contact 86 CTS/CEXD/CEXTI
  UNIT 3335 APO AE 09094 to arrange training for contract maintenance personnel.

                                                Chapter 2

              OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, CERTIFICATION, AND INSPECTION

2.1. General Information.
     2.1.1. This chapter provides basic information on inspection, maintenance, certification, operation,
     maintenance records, and deficiency reporting for aircraft arresting systems. Information contained in
     this chapter is intended to be general in nature. Specific technical information may be found in the
     applicable 35E8-2 series T.O.s.
     2.1.2. T.O.s for BAK-12 and BAK-13 provide alternate procedures for removing an aircraft from the
     cable after engagement. These alternate procedures are commonly referred to as "slingshotting" the
     aircraft. Potential for aircraft damage is high when using these methods; therefore, use these proce-
     dures only during contingencies when conditions warrant rapid cycling of the arresting system.

2.2. Inspection and General Maintenance.
     2.2.1. Inspections must be performed in accordance with the applicable T.O., information contained
     within this instruction, and the 35E8-2 series work cards.
     2.2.1. (USAFE) Technical Orders. Use the appropriate technical order to inspect, operate, and main-
     tain the AAS. Proper inspection and maintenance of each AAS includes but is not limited to the fol-
     lowing:
        2.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Daily inspection before the beginning of scheduled flying operations
        as outlined in the applicable technical order for the specific AAS.
        2.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) If a deficiency is discovered on an AAS, which would prohibit a suc-
        cessful engagement, note the AAS out of service with the control tower and airfield manager.
        Notify the NCOIC of AAS maintenance immediately. If the AAS cannot be returned to service
        without delay, enter a red “X” in the appropriate AFTO Form 244. Notify the BCE, airfield man-
        ager, command post, and flying safety officer. The AAS will remain out of service until the condi-
        tion is corrected or the red “X” is downgraded by appropriate authority. This individual will clear
        the red “X” condition by initialing over the symbol.
        2.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Whenever an AAS is noted out of service, remove the cable from the
        runway and extinguish the runway AAS marker lights.
        2.2.1.4. (Added-USAFE) Mark each AAS pendant cable crossing according to AFI 32-1042,
        Standards For Marking Airfields.
        2.2.1.5. (Added-USAFE) After every engagement and before starting any recycling operations,
        record the tachometer and maximum pressure gauge readings and the length of run-out in the AAS
        and fire station log.
        2.2.1.6. (Added-USAFE) When new pendants and purchase tapes are installed, record contract
        number, date manufactured, national stock number (NSN), and the date installed in the AAS log-
        book and maintenance records.
     2.2.2. In-service pendant cables must be inspected daily and after each engagement. Spare pendants
     should be stored indoors.
AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                     19


  2.2.3. Crop exposed tape between the runway edge sheave (fairlead beam) and the tape connector on
  BAK-9 and BAK-12 systems every 6 months. Crop tape between the absorber base and the tape con-
  nector every 6 months on expeditionary systems if a tape tube is not used. Reverse (end-for-end) tapes
  on all systems every 24 months. No nylon tapes should be retained in service longer than 48 months,
  or if usage exceeds the maximum allowable for engagements and pull-outs or tape stack height in the
  applicable 35E8-2 series T.O. Due to the negative effects of ultra violet light on nylon, every effort
  should be made to protect tapes from direct sunlight. For this reason, all spare nylon tapes must be
  stored indoors.
  2.2.4. For MA-1A, a new webbing assembly must be installed after each engagement. See T.O.
  35E8-2-2-1, USAF Types MA-1 and MA-1A Runway Overrun Barrier, Section 1, for details. Also,
  inspect pendant cables and replace if conditions are indicated. Reposition the energy absorber chain to
  service position (T.O. 35E8-2-2-1, Figure 1-1). If it is necessary to recover the chain from a wet area
  after an engagement, care should be taken to keep the vehicle on the paved surface. A motor-grader or
  other heavy-duty pneumatic tire vehicle should be used on the paved surface during recycle opera-
  tions.
  2.2.5. The 60 meters (200 feet) of pavement on both the approach and departure sides of the arresting
  system pendant for a width equal to the off-center engagement capability of the system are critical
  areas. Protruding objects, excessive paint build-up, excessive joint sealant material, warped sacrificial
  panels, and undulating surfaces are detrimental to successful tailhook engagements and are not allow-
  able. This area of the runway must be visually inspected at least monthly for indications of the above
  noted conditions. Suspect areas, such as pavement cracks and joints and panels beneath the cable must
  be inspected more closely, and increased attention will be necessary after each freeze-thaw cycle.
     2.2.5.1. Problem areas must be immediately identified to the base pavements engineer for a more
     thorough inspection and corrective action. The airfield manager must also be notified so that
     NOTAMs, local NOTAMs, and aircrew briefings can be issued to highlight the potential problem
     pending corrective action.
     2.2.5.2. Perform more detailed inspections of suspect areas with a 4-meter (12-foot) straight edge.
     Begin on the runway centerline and check the pavement in the immediate area of the cable for
     high spots, depressions, or other undulations, out to a point beyond the first transverse pavement
     joint, or for a minimum longitudinal distance of 6 meters (18 feet), whichever is more. Repeat this
     procedure within 1 meter (3 feet) on both sides of the runway centerline, and then at not more than
     2-meter (6-foot) intervals across the runway for a distance equal to the off-center engagement
     capability of the system. Grind flush any high spots exceeding 3 millimeters (1/8 inch), Report
     depressions exceeding 3 millimeters (1/8 inch) in depth to the base pavements engineer for correc-
     tive action.
  2.2.6. (Added-USAFE) AAS Logistics Support. To take advantage of central consumption data for
  AAS spares, stock record account FB5612 is designated to fund, requisition, store and issue DIFM
  parts, including tapes for BAK-12, and reset kits for Textile AAS. FB5612 is located at Ramstein AB
  GE, and is under the control of the Commander, 86 CTS. This instruction prescribes special proce-
  dures to support AAS command wide. Because of the urgent need to maintain AAS in operational sta-
  tus at all times, supply and transportation of spare parts must be expedited to effect immediate repairs
  for any out-of commission AAS.
20                                                         AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


        2.2.6.1. (Added-USAFE) Bench Stock. Bench stock items for the BAK-12, Textile AAS,
        BAK-14 and MAAS will be established by the using base that normally contain spares to properly
        maintain the AAS within safe operating criteria.
        2.2.6.2. (Added-USAFE) Parts Funding. The BCE will not increase the operational operating
        budget (008) to support DIFM parts and tapes received from the FB5612 account because these
        are provided at no cost to the base. However, the BCE will budget for bench stock issued from the
        local chief of supply.
        2.2.6.3. (Added-USAFE) Parts and Equipment Excesses. Using activities will coordinate with 86
        CTS/CEXD (DSN480-7207) prior to any shipment of AAS parts or equipment to confirm if a
        USAFE base has a priority need of any BAK-12, Textile AAS, BAK-14 or MAAS parts or equip-
        ment before spares are shipped to 86 CTS/CEXD.
        2.2.6.4. (Added-USAFE) Mission Capability (MICAP) Requirements. MICAP reportable equip-
        ment in a non-mission capable condition will be requisitioned by the local host base supply. Under
        no conditions will MICAP actions be taken without prior approval of the 86 CTS (normal duty
        hours, DSN 480-7207, after normal duty hours, DSN 480-7107/6167). All units will ensure cor-
        rect system reporting designator (SRD) is loaded within the supply computer by obtaining prior
        coordination with the MICAP unit of base supply.
        2.2.6.5. (Added-USAFE) Special Levels. Special levels should be requested on AF Form 1996,
        Adjusted Stock Level, by the local BCE to ensure adequate backup stocks to support installed air-
        craft arresting systems.
     2.2.7. (Added-USAFE) MAAS Logistics Support. All MAAS will be assigned to and accounted for
     by the MOB. All MOB and COB MAAS are assigned under TA 156. If available, store the MAAS in
     covered storage. If covered storage is not available at the COB, the MAAS can be stored at the support
     MOB until storage buildings can be programmed and constructed at the COB. Make every effort to
     preposition the MAAS at the MOB or COB of assignment.
        2.2.7.1. (Added-USAFE) The wing holding accountability for each MAAS provides follow-on
        transportation (after initial placement) of MAAS.
        2.2.7.2. (Added-USAFE) The MOB ensures that required bench stock items are ordered and
        maintained for themselves and their COB.
        2.2.7.3. (Added-USAFE) Funding requirements for parts procurement, maintenance, and repair
        of the MAAS is identified in AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program Guidance and
        Procedures or major command (MAJCOM) directives. The program element code (PEC) 28031,
        and the budget code listing determines the funding responsibility.
        2.2.7.4. (Added-USAFE) MAAS is war reserve material and is the responsibility of the
        base-level WRM organization. 86 CTS/CEXD cannot provide tapes or spare parts for these sys-
        tems.

2.3. System Certification.
     2.3.1. All Air Force arresting gear excluding MA-1A, E-5, BAK-15, Textile Brake, and soft ground
     arrestor systems (such as the Engineered Material Arresting System [EMAS]) that have not been
     engaged for the past 12 months must be certified by an aircraft engagement using speeds and weights
     listed in Table 2.1. Certification engagements will be made toward the center of the runway. This may
AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                        21


   require the aircraft starting position to be in the over-run area. This requirement also applies to initial
   system installations, after a brake change, overhaul, or replacement of any hydraulic component in the
   braking system. It does not apply to War Reserve Materiel systems in storage.

Table 2.1. Certification Weights and Speeds.

                                        9,072 kg (20,000 lbs)                     105 knots
 BAK-12, BAK-13, and MAAS              13,608 kg (30,000 lbs)                     85 knots
                                       18,144 kg (40,000 lbs)                     75 knots
   2.3.2. If extenuating circumstances prevent certification by engagement, a certification inspection
   must be performed or the system must be removed from service. The certification inspection must be
   performed by a MAJCOM designated representative on or before the anniversary of the last system
   engagement. The inspection must include (but is not limited to) all requirements in Section 5 of the
   applicable 35E8-series T.O. The period between aircraft engagements must not exceed 24 months.
   The assigned base maintenance personnel may not perform the inspection.
   2.3.3. Maintenance crews will also be evaluated during certification engagements. The following fac-
   tors will be considered:
       2.3.3.1. Evaluate crew proficiency in disconnecting the aircraft and returning the system to ser-
       vice.
       2.3.3.2. Evaluate adequacy of maintenance records and data.
       2.3.3.3. Evaluate availability of necessary tools, spare parts, and equipment.
   2.3.4. Responsibility for assuring that certification is accomplished according to this instruction rests
   with the host command. Base personnel must provide an information copy of each record of certifica-
   tion engagement or certification inspection report to Airfield Management for their file. Records of
   certifications will also be maintained by each base and MAJCOM for not less than 2 years.
   2.3.5. (Added-USAFE) Certification. Do not certify operational, newly installed (including MAAS)
   and reinstalled AAS, and those with brake changes or reel changes, until a test is made by an aircraft
   not committed to flight. Waivers to this policy must be coordinated through HQ USAFE/A3TV and
   HQ USAFE/A7AO.
       2.3.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Aircraft used for these tests will be fully crewed, but not committed for
       flight.
       2.3.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Aircraft will be operational, and normal maintenance preflight and
       launch actions accomplished with the exception that gear down locks or pins and external tank
       safety pins be installed. Ejection systems will be armed and the drag chute installed if applicable.
       2.3.5.3. (Added-USAFE) Aircraft fitted for external fuel tanks, if installed, will be empty.
       2.3.5.4. (Added-USAFE) Engage the AAS in a direction which leaves the maximum runway
       available after the engagement. The aircraft weight will dictate the speed of engagement. NOTE:
22                                                           AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


        Tail hook load limits are not considered with the speeds and weights for individual aircraft. The
        Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) and flight safety officer (SEF) will ensure speed/weight
        remain below safe limits for structural airframe loading. In some instances, acceleration distances
        available may be insufficient for aircraft to attain the higher recommended speed. If this is the
        case, the test will be considered valid if the hydraulic selector valve shuttles from static pressure to
        pump pressure on both absorbers. The on-site power production craftsman is authorized to change
        the weight and speed of certification requirements if local conditions preclude the foregoing certi-
        fication data, but not less than the criteria listed in AFI 32-1043. The intent in providing minimum
        weights and speeds within AFI 32-1043 are to ensure that the certification engagement validates
        operation of the BAK-12 hydraulic system by shuttling the system to pump pressure from static
        brake pressure.
        2.3.5.5. (Added-USAFE) When possible, aerospace vehicles will be prepositioned.
        2.3.5.6. (Added-USAFE) The aircrew will accomplish applicable portions of approach-end
        arrestment checklist. Aircrew will review post engagement/extraction procedures prior to certifi-
        cation attempt.

2.4. Operation.
     2.4.1. Disconnect and remove unidirectional barrier nets and pendant cables located in overruns on
     the approach end of the runway. Also disconnect and remove BAK-9 cables located on the runway on
     the approach end. Full-size net systems such as the BAK-15 may remain in place in the overrun in the
     down position; however, the energy absorbers must be disconnected and the BCE's designated repre-
     sentative must inform the airfield manager and the MAJCOM/DO and SE when the net will be left in
     place. Do this to publicize the potential hazard to aircrew.
        2.4.1.1. If environmental conditions require frequent changes in the configuration of MA-1A/
        MA-1A Modified net systems (runway changes), the nets may be left in place on the approach end
        of the runway to avoid excessive wear from abrasion; however, the non-standard configuration
        must first be recommended by the installation commander and approved by the MAJCOM DO,
        SE, and CE.
        2.4.1.2. Additionally, the energy absorbers must be disconnected from the engaging device(s)
        before operations commence in the opposite direction (toward the unidirectional system).
     2.4.2. Maintain BAK-12 and BAK-13 operational arresting systems in the ready position on the
     approach and departure ends of the runway unless the installation commander directs otherwise. You
     may remove barriers and hook cables from the overrun and runway during snow and ice removal
     operations, but coordinate removal with airfield management first, and return the barriers and hook
     cables to operational status as soon as possible.
        2.4.2.1. The BAK-14 and the Type H hook cable support systems were not designed to operate in
        the up position with repeated aircraft rollovers. Repeated high-speed rollovers will damage the
        system components, reduce system reliability, increase the chance of a missed engagement, and
        increase maintenance costs.
        2.4.2.2. Low-speed taxi rollovers must also be kept to a minimum to prevent degradation of sys-
        tem performance. In the event the aircraft arresting system is not required to stop the aircraft, air
        traffic control (ATC) should lower the BAK-14 or Type H prior to rollover.
AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                       23


   2.4.3. When performing duties associated with aircraft arresting systems and barriers in the airfield
   environment, it will be necessary to communicate with ATC, ground control, fire rescue, and base
   operations by way of two-way radio. Follow local procedures established within the Airfield Operat-
   ing Instruction (AOI) and the base flight line driving regulation and program. General terms to be
   used for radio communication are provided in AFI 13-203, Air Traffic Control, AFI 13-213, Airfield
   Management, and Federal Aviation Administration Handbook (FAAH) 7110.65N, Air Traffic Control,
   Pilot/Controller Glossary. The most common terms for use and their definitions are provided in para-
   graphs 2.4.3.1.1. through 2.4.3.1.7. Attachment 1 also provides definitions for the various terms that
   relate specifically to the airfield and airfield operational areas, including the method used to designate
   the in-use runway.
      2.4.3.1. Common phrases used in radio communication and their meanings are provided below.
      The phrase "clear" must not be used when communicating with tower personnel.
          2.4.3.1.1. “Acknowledge” — Request that you have received and understand the message.
          2.4.3.1.2. “Affirmative” — Yes.
          2.4.3.1.3. “Negative” — No.
          2.4.3.1.4. “Say Again” — Request to repeat the message.
          2.4.3.1.5. “Roger” — I have received and understand the last transmission.
          2.4.3.1.6. “Hold Short” — Do not proceed per the tower’s instructions.
          2.4.3.1.7. “Wilco” — I have received and will comply with your message.
      2.4.3.2. There is no standard phraseology for reporting system status to ATC; however, use “oper-
      ational” and “not operational,” and “in-service” and “out of service” consistently when reporting
      status to the airfield authority. These terms are easy to understand descriptions of airfield systems.
      The specific terms selected for each base should be specified within the local AOI.
      2.4.3.3. When communicating the location of an aircraft arresting system on the active runway,
      use the active runway designation and refer to the system in question by approach, midfield, or
      departure end cable, or approach or departure end barrier. In this case, it is important to differenti-
      ate between cables and barriers. BAK-12, BAK-13, and BAK-14 systems are cable systems, not
      barriers. Net systems such as MA-1A and BAK-15 systems are barriers. See the definition of
      terms in Attachment 1. The active runway (the runway in use) is identified by the numeric desig-
      nation of the approach end of the runway. For example, for Runway 12/30, the active runway
      would be "Runway 12" when aircraft are taking-off from, or landing toward the end of Runway
      12, or are on a 120 degree compass heading.

2.5. Standard Hand Signals.
   2.5.1. Standard hand signals for use between aircraft arresting system crewmembers and aircrew
   members are provided in AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground. Standard
   hand signals for use between aircraft arresting system crewmembers are shown in Figure 2.1.

        OBTAINING NEW SYSTEMS, SITING, AND INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Obtaining New Systems.
     3.1.1. Identify new system requirements to the MAJCOM and AFCESA, in turn, at least 2 years in
     advance, or as soon as new requirements are known, to allow sufficient lead-time for budgeting, man-
     ufacturing, and delivery.
     3.1.2. The BCE's representative processes new requirements by first coordinating with the MAJCOM
     functional manager for aircraft arresting systems. The MAJCOM functional manager coordinates the
     new requirement with the MAJCOM DO, SE, and CE, and responds to the base request. Once com-
     mand endorsement is received, the base representative submits an AFEMS request to the Base Equip-
     ment Management Office (BEMO).
     3.1.3. Semiannually, the MAJCOM CE representative must identify all new requirements to HQ
     AFCESA/CES during the call for new requirements.
     3.1.4. HQ AFCESA/CES Civil Engineering Division (HQ AFCESA/CESC) validates the new
     requirements with WR-ALC for budgeting and procurement.
     3.1.5. Upon approval of the AFEMS request, base-level personnel should requisition the system and
     any other components not included in the Government Supplied Equipment (GSE) kit, such as the
     pendant.

3.2. Siting New Systems.
     3.2.1. General Information. Aircraft arresting systems and overrun barriers are installed in several
     configurations. Typically, overrun barriers (nets) and emergency arrestors such as MA-1A, BAK-15,
     E-5 chain gear, Textile Brake, or soft ground arrestor systems are installed as redundant systems for
     emergency recovery only. As such, they are installed in the overrun area of the runway. Operational
     arresting systems, such as BAK-12, are usually installed between the runway thresholds. This is nec-
     essary to allow pilots to touch down on the normal landing surface and stabilize the tail hook before
     engagement. Fairlead beams (to direct the purchase tape path) are installed on the runway shoulders to
     allow the energy absorber to be installed outside the mandatory zone of frangibility (at least 84 meters
     [275 feet] away from the runway centerline). Support ramps are constructed to lead up to exposed ver-
     tical surfaces of fairlead beams and tape tubes to allow an aircraft to roll over them smoothly. Arrest-
     ing gear that is installed on grade must have a frangible structure built over it to protect the equipment
     from environmental degradation. Design should be in compliance with typical installation drawings
     67F2011 or 67F2012, as applicable, this instruction, the applicable 35E8-2 series T.O., and frangibil-
     ity requirements detailed within UFC 3-260-01 (see Chapter 3 and Attachment 14). Shelters must also
     contain adequate ventilation and have windows located so operators can see the arrestment area and
     directly across the runway. Do not install any arresting system where the runout will conflict with any
     other arresting system or any obstacle such as elevated airfield lights or signs. In cases where criteria
     cannot be met, a waiver must be established according to UFC 3-260-01 and/or the applicable T.O., as
     appropriate.
     3.2.2. Siting Operational Systems. The large rectangular pavement markings (Fixed Distance Mark-
     ings) located 300 meters (1,000 feet) from the threshold represent the ideal aim point for pilots on
AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                        29


   approach to landing. Other visual landing aids, such as the visual glide slope indicator system, cue the
   pilot to touch down approximately 300 meters (1,000 feet) from the threshold. This ensures a mini-
   mum threshold crossing height of at least 11 meters (35 feet). Since stabilizing the tailhook after
   touchdown requires a distance of 150 to 240 meters (500 to 800 feet), the best location for an arresting
   system that accommodates approach end engagements is 450 to 540 meters (1,500 to 1,800 feet) from
   the threshold. Runways used extensively during instrument meteorological conditions may require
   that the system be sited as much as 670 meters (2,200 feet) from the threshold; however, if aircraft that
   are not compatible with trampling of the pendant must operate on the same runway, the installation
   commander may shift the installation site as close to the threshold as possible, but not closer than the
   distance that will allow an unobstructed runout. It is critical that the runout area for an aircraft engag-
   ing the system from either direction not conflict with other aircraft arresting systems or equipment
   such as threshold or runway end light fixtures. Other operating scenarios, such as northern tier loca-
   tions with heavy snow or ice accumulation, may dictate that you place an additional system at the
   midpoint of the runway. The installation commander must approve midfield siting after coordinating
   the plan with the host MAJCOM DO, SE, and CE.
   3.2.3. Siting Emergency Systems. Locate unidirectional arresting systems and barriers (nets) in the
   overrun area of the runway. The energy-absorbing device dictates the distance from the threshold
   because of the need to accommodate full system runout. Do not locate unidirectional systems or net
   barriers closer than 11 meters (35 feet) from the threshold of the runway. NOTE: Runway threshold
   markings begin 6 meters (20 feet) inboard of the full strength pavement; therefore, do not install a uni-
   directional system within 17 meters (55 feet) of the threshold markings.

3.3. Installation Requirements.
   3.3.1. Comply with the following standards when locating, configuring, installing, or repairing an
   arresting system. BCEs must get the installation commander's approval and coordinate with MAJ-
   COM DO, SE, and CE organizations before deviating from these standards. Waiver to UFC 3-260-01
   or the applicable 35E8-2 series T.O. will be required if these standards cannot be met.
   3.3.2. The BCE's designated representative determines the configuration and location of arresting
   systems in cooperation with representatives from DO and SE. Design must conform to the criteria in
   section 3 of the appropriate 35E8-series T.O., the typical installation drawings, as well as the require-
   ments in this instruction and UFC 3-260-01. In cases where criteria cannot be met, a waiver must be
   established according to UFC 3-260-01 and/or the applicable T.O., as appropriate.
      3.3.2.1. Locate all energy absorbers below grade or at least 84 meters (275 feet) from the runway
      centerline. Provide paved transitions and buried crushed stone ramps around the arresting system
      components and a service road to the site from the runway, as well as a location other than the run-
      way. Pit-type installations may be sited closer to the runway as long as they meet the minimum
      split-distance required; however, all above-grade appurtenances must be frangible, the transition
      to the pit cover must meet runway shoulder grade allowances given in Chapter 3 of UFC 3-260-01
      and the pit cover and door must be designed in accordance with USAF ETL 02-1, Design of
      Drainage Structures for Heavy Aircraft Loading.
      3.3.2.2. Where fairlead beams and tape tubes project above the grade of the existing runway
      shoulders, provide suitable fill materials and compaction next to or over these components to a
      finished grade of 1V:30H or flatter. Existing tape tubes must be steel or ductile iron capable of
      supporting a 34,000-kilogram (75-kip) wheel load. For new installations, select tape tubes that
30                                                         AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


     will comply with design requirements within Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 02-1, Design of
     Drainage Structures for Heavy Aircraft Loading.
     3.3.2.3. Provide obstruction marking and lighting and arresting system location marking and
     lighting according to the provisions of AFI 32-1042, Standards for Marking Airfields, and
     AFMAN 32-1076, Visual Air Navigation Systems.
     3.3.2.4. Use frangible protective shelters for above-grade systems to comply with the frangibility
     requirement in UFC 3-260-01, Attachment 14. Also provide a removable roof or end to facilitate
     major maintenance or replacement of the equipment inside.
     3.3.2.5. The 60 meters (200 feet) of pavement on both the approach and departure sides of the
     arresting system pendant are critical areas. Protruding objects, excessive paint build-up, and undu-
     lating surfaces are detrimental to successful tail hook engagements and are not allowable. The
     maximum permissible longitudinal surface deviation in this area is plus or minus 3 millimeters
     (0.125 inch) in 4 meters (12 feet). This does not apply to grooved pavement surfaces. Grooving to
     improve surface drainage and surface friction characteristics may be accomplished to within 3
     meters (10 feet) of arresting system cables. Changes in pavement type or an interface between
     rigid and flexible pavements are not permitted within 60 meters (200 feet) of arresting system
     cables (this does not apply to installation of sacrificial polyethylene panels or to emergency sys-
     tems located within the overrun). Rigid inlays must not be used as a surface repair material
     beneath the cable in a flexible runway system. This type repair causes high hook skip potential
     when the flexible pavement consolidates, exposing the leading edge of the rigid pavement. How-
     ever, rigid pavement must be used as a foundation for sacrificial pads installed beneath aircraft
     arresting system cables in both rigid and flexible pavement systems.
     3.3.2.6. Install cable tie down anchors beneath operational systems (systems located between the
     runway thresholds) to limit cable bounce and potential aircraft damage during aircraft rollover.
     Install 8 anchors for F-16 operating bases, and 4 anchors at all other locations. Install anchors at
     6-meter (20-foot) intervals centered on the runway width for 4-point tie downs, or at 3-meter
     (10-foot) intervals centered on the runway width for 8-point tie downs. Offset anchor locations at
     least 600 millimeters (2 feet) from all pavement joints. If sacrificial panels are, or will be installed,
     see Attachment 8 for anchor spacing. See Figure 3.1., Figure 3.2., and Figure 3.3. for cable
     tie-down anchor installation. Either installation may be used for flexible or rigid runway pave-
     ments. Specific designs must be developed for each runway system to ensure adequate holding
     strength.
         3.3.2.6.1. Secure the cable to the anchors with a length of 10 millimeters (3/8-inch) diameter,
         three-strand nylon rope (NSN 4020-00-968-1356) approximately 1,200 millimeters (48
         inches) long (2,200 kg [5,000 lbs] breaking strength). The rope must be fastened to the anchor
         with a simple overhand knot, and then tied to the cable with a square knot.
         3.3.2.6.2. Tie a simple overhand knot as close to the square knot as possible with the remain-
         ing rope. This will prevent the square knot from becoming loose. See Figure 3.3. and Figure
         3.4.

      3.3.2.7. The BCE's aircraft arresting system representative reviews the construction drawings and
      contract specifications at the 35 percent and 65 percent completion stages and approves at the 90
      percent design completion phase. Other entities with a stake in the project, such as SE and DO,
      should also be asked to review the project drawings and contract specifications. The BCE's repre-
      sentative also ensures that installation contracts stipulate that:
AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                         35


           3.3.2.7.1. The construction superintendent, project engineer, or other authority experienced in
           installing arresting systems is on site during construction and installation of each system.
           3.3.2.7.2. The contractor corrects any deficiencies in the installation until at least 2 pullouts of
           the purchase tape are accomplished in each direction of intended operation and the contracting
           officer officially accepts the system.

3.4. Grandfathered Systems. On-grade BAK-12 systems installed prior to 1 July 1977 that are sited at
least 76.2 meters (250 feet) from runway centerline do not have to be relocated to meet the minimum set
back requirement of 84 meters (275 feet) from runway centerline; however, all systems equipped with
deck sheaves or 2-roller fairlead beams must be programmed for retrofit with 3-roller fairlead beams to
eliminate the longitudinal wheel abutment along the runway shoulder. Replacement foundations must be
constructed as described in paragraphs 3.3.2.1., 3.3.2.2., and the typical installation drawings to comply
with the 1V:30H (3 percent) maximum slope requirement along the runway shoulder (see UFC 3-260-01,
Table 3.2).

3.5. Installing Systems at Jointly Used Airports.
   3.5.1. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) acts for and on behalf of the DOD Service compo-
   nent in operating arresting systems installed at jointly used civil airports for the primary use of US
   military aircraft.
   3.5.2. Site arresting systems on civil airports jointly used by civil and military aircraft according to
   FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 150/5220-9, Aircraft Arresting Systems for Joint Civil/Military Airports.
   Order this Advisory Circular from:
       US Department of Transportation
       General Services Section
       M-443.2
       Washington DC 20590
   3.5.3. To install an arresting system at a jointly used civil airport, the installation commander must
   first notify the airport manager (or authority) of the need. If the airport manager agrees, the installation
   commander submits the plan with sketches or drawings to the Air Force liaison officer at the FAA
   regional office. Refer any disagreement between the responsible officials to the next higher level.
   3.5.4. If construction involves a lease agreement that does not allow placement of additional struc-
   tures on the leased premises, contact the MAJCOM.
   3.5.5. Third-party claims presented for damage, injury, or death resulting from the FAA operation of
   the system for military aircraft or from the Air Force or Air National Guard maintenance of the system
   may be the responsibility of the Air Force. Process such claims under the appropriate Air Force regu-
   latory guidance (AFI 51-502, Personnel and Government Recovery Claims).
   3.5.6. The FAA is responsible for claims presented for damage resulting from FAA operation of the
   system for civil aircraft; therefore, separate agreements between the DOD and the FAA concerning
   liability for such damage are not necessary.
   3.5.7. The MAJCOM negotiates the operational agreement with FAA for a jointly used civil airport.
   The MAJCOM may delegate this authority to the installation commander. The agreement describes
36                                                           AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


     FAA functions and responsibilities concerning the remote control operation of arresting systems by
     FAA air traffic controllers. See Attachment 5 for a sample letter of agreement.

3.6. Military Rights Agreements for Non-Continental US Locations and Use by Non-US Govern-
ment Aircraft .
     3.6.1. Install these systems under the military rights agreement with the host government. The instal-
     lation commander coordinates any separate agreements required with the local US diplomatic repre-

Aircraft Arresting System (AAS)—A combination of components used to engage an aircraft and absorb
its forward inertia. Generally, each AAS consists of an energy absorber and one or more securing or
AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                      43


engagement receivers. All systems are capable of an expeditious return to the battery or operational
position. Common AASs at USAFE bases are the, BAK-12, BAK-12/14, MAAS, E5, and Textile.
BAK-14 Hook Cable Support System—A modification to an AAS that provides a method to position
the pendant below the runway surface and raise it to the battery position as required. Raising the cable can
be accomplished by either the control tower or power production/fire protection personnel.
BCE Certification—Technicians who have attended a formal AAS course during their career need not be
recertified prior to assuming AAS maintenance duties at their USAFE base. The BCE, through the
NCOIC of the barrier maintenance shop and the chief of operations, can determine by interview and
review of On the Job Training (OJT) records, enlisted performance reports (EPR), and education records,
the level of experience of assigned personnel. For technicians who have never attended a formal AAS
course, they must possess a minimum of 6 months OJT experience operating and maintaining AAS on
their own base prior to BCE certification. For an individual to be BCE certified, they should prove they
have gained, through OJT, the knowledge level comparable to the graduation level of a formal course.
This should only be granted to those technicians who are exceptionally well versed and qualified on AAS.
Technicians certified by their unit commander are authorized to certify an AAS back in service after an
arrestment or after performing corrective maintenance for an out of service condition. If the BCE feels an
individual needs formal training, either because they have no prior AAS experience or a refresher course
is required, 86 CTS/CEX offers an AAS operations and maintenance refresher course to fulfill this
requirement.
Command Certification—86 CTS/CEXD technicians will be authorized to certify an AAS operational
after an arrestment or corrective field-level maintenance for an out of service condition. Command
certification by 86 CTS/CEXD technicians refers to operational certification of a previously identified
“out-of-service” barrier. Command certification by 86 CTS/CEXD will only occur after new AAS
installations, 10-year overhaul change outs, deck sheave and fairlead beam change outs, and any other
major maintenance action.
Energy Absorber—The mechanism through which the kinetic energy of the aircraft is dissipated.
Common types within USAFE are the E5 chain, BAK-12/MAAS rotary friction brakes, and the Textile
modules.
Maintenance—Maintenance of AAS consists of correcting all deficiencies noted during inspection of the
AAS. Repair at base level is usually limited to replacement of AAS assemblies and subassemblies
external to the AAS. Major components of depot-level repair will be performed by 86 CTS depot
technicians.
Methods of Engagement—The systems through which an aircraft engages and transfers its energy to the
absorber. Common methods are the E5 pendant cable for hook-equipped aircraft, the BAK-12, BAK-12/
14, MAAS, and Textile Modular Brake.
Operations—Actions required for successful aircraft arrestments with an AAS are termed operations.
Operations include all required inspections, pendant pre-tensioning, responding to aircraft engagements,
and maintaining records.
Rewind/Recycle System—A device, which returns the AAS (tapes and pendant) to the battery or
engagement ready position. Common AAS rewind/recycle systems are the BAK-12 and MAAS gasoline
or diesel engine driven rewind systems.
Run out—The measurement made from the battery position of the pendant to the aircraft-arresting hook.

Span—The distance between the edge sheaves on the runway.
Split—The distance between the center of the runway edge sheave or rear end of a fairlead beam to the
front end of the energy absorber (lead-off sheave).
Tape Stack Height—A measurement taken from the outside diameter of the tape storage reel side plates
to the lowest level of the tape on the reel. (This measurement is taken 3-feet away from the hump caused
by the tape clamp on the hub.) This measurement is used to determine the correct amount of tape allowed
on the reel.

                      TYPES OF USAF AIRCRAFT ARRESTING SYSTEMS

A2.1. General Information. Aircraft arresting systems consist of engaging devices and energy absorb-
ers. Engaging devices are net barriers such as MA-1A and BAK-15, disc-supported pendants (hook
cables), and cable support systems such as BAK-14 and the Aerazur Type H, that raise the pendant to the
battery position or retract it below the runway surface. Energy absorbing devices are ships' anchor chains,
rotary friction brakes (such as the BAK-9 and BAK-12), or rotary hydraulic systems (such as the
BAK-13). Table A2.1. and Table A2.2. below show the leading particulars for USAF energy absorbing
systems.

  ** The MB 100.12C can produce hook loads that exceed the working limit for pre Block
  40 F-16 aircraft. Therefore, it should not be used at installations that host this model
  aircraft (mission, tenant, or transient support). Block 40 model F-16 and later are fully
  compatible with the MB100.12 Textile Brake Arresting System.

A2.2. Types of USAF Systems.
     A2.2.1. MA-1A. The MA-1A emergency arresting system consists of a net barrier and cable system
     designed to engage the main landing gear of an aircraft (Figure A2.1.). Because it is a unidirectional
     system, it must always be installed in the overrun area. Aircraft engaging this system above the speed
     and weight limits provided in Figure A2.3. (or Chart 1-1 of T.O. 35E8-2-2-1) will result in a runout
     greater than 305 meters (1,000 feet), or cable failure. Most MA-1A systems employ ships' anchor
     chains as the energy absorber. These systems require a runout area of at least 259 meters (850 feet)
     plus the length of the aircraft. The chains lie on either side of the runway overrun, beginning at the
     barrier location and running in the direction of aircraft travel; however, some MA-1A systems use a
     BAK-9 instead of a ships' anchor chain as the energy absorber. These systems require a runout area of
     at least 290 meters (950 feet) plus the length of the aircraft. This configuration is an MA-1A/BAK-9.
     The MA-1A may also be complemented with a hook-cable interconnect to accommodate hook
     engagement. This arrangement is shown in Figure A2.2. The MA-1A is not currently in production as
     a system. Do not consider it for new installations unless you can salvage the necessary equipment
     from another facility. Obtain further technical information on this system from T.O. 35E8-2-2-1.

   A2.2.2. E-5. This unidirectional emergency arresting system is a US Navy design and designation.
   Much like the MA-1A, this system uses several shots of ships' anchor chain as the energy absorber,
   but these systems are never connected with a barrier (net). For the Navy or Marine Corps, these sys-
   tems can have from 1 to 4 disc-supported hook cables, with designations of E-5 and E-5 Mod 1
   through E-5 Mod 3. Obtain further technical information on the Navy configuration of this system

     are sited and maintained as MA-1A. They are designated as an E-5 (Figure A2.4.).

     A2.2.3. BAK-9. The BAK-9 (Figure A2.5.) is an obsolete bi-directional emergency arresting system.
     It consisted of 1 energy absorber that employed 2 rotary friction brakes and purchase-tape reels
     mounted on a common shaft. The reels were mechanically connected at the midpoint by a third brake
     that acted as a clutch. This allowed each reel to turn at different speeds during off-center engagements
     and helped steer the aircraft toward the center of the runway. The energy absorber for these systems
     was installed below grade on 1 side of the runway and the purchase tape was routed to the opposite
     side of the runway through deflector sheaves and duct. The other purchase tape (near side) was routed
     to a turnaround sheave located in a pit sited to allow both purchase tapes to be of equal length. The
     BAK-9 is not currently in production as a system and should not be considered as a suitable system for
     a new requirement. Obtain further technical information on this system from T.O. 35E8-2-4-1, Air-
     craft Arresting Gear, Model BAK-9.

Figure A2.5. BAK-9 Aircraft Arresting System.




   A2.2.4. BAK-12. The BAK-12 (Figure A2.6.) is the standard USAF operational aircraft arresting
   system. This bi-directional system employs 2 energy absorbers. Each absorber consists of 2 multi-disc
   rotary friction brakes mounted on either side of the purchase-tape reel on a common shaft. The energy
   absorbers are located on opposite sides of the runway, connected to a 32-millimeter (1.25-inch)
   disc-supported pendant by the purchase tape. Ideally, the energy absorbers should be in a below-grade
   pit with a minimum split distance of 15.24 meters (50 feet). (Split distance is a measurement taken
   between the lead-on sheave of the fairlead beam or deck sheave, and the energy absorber.) Split dis-
   tances of up to 91 meters (300 feet) are acceptable for all BAK-12 installations. You may also install
   BAK-12 systems above grade in one of two configurations, the selection depending upon site condi-
   tions and operational requirements. These are the expeditionary installation for periods of up to 1 year,
   and the semi-permanent installation, well-suited for long term use and typically selected when site
   conditions will not allow a pit-type installation. Siting and grading requirements are in section 3 of
   USAF T.O. 35E8-2-5-1, BAK-12. Typical installation drawings for pit-type installations (drawing
   number 67F2012) and semi-permanent installations (drawing number 67F2011) are available from
   HQ AFCESA/CESC and WR-ALC/LESG.
      A2.2.4.1. Originally, BAK-12 energy absorbers were fitted with a 60-inch purchase-tape storage
      reel. This design allowed the maximum energy expected to be imparted during an aircraft engage-
52                                                       AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


     ment to dissipate within a runout of 290 meters (950 feet) plus the length of the aircraft. Designers
     have since improved the BAK-12 to meet increased demands of heavier and faster aircraft. They
     retrofitted the energy absorbers with larger 66-inch or 72-inch tape storage reels to accommodate
     increased runout, thus increasing the total energy capacity of the system. Although some BAK-12
     systems have 60-inch tape storage reels, new and upgraded BAK-12 systems (part numbers
     52-W-2291-801, 52-W-2291-801A, 52-W-2291-901, and 52-W-2291-901A) have 66-inch reels.
     These systems require 366 meters (1,200 feet) plus the length of the aircraft for maximum runout.
     The 72-inch reel systems are special-purpose systems configured for 610 meters (2,000 feet) of
     runout.
     A2.2.4.2. The standard BAK-12 is configured for cross-runway separations of up to 61 meters
     (200 feet) (distance between fairlead beams or deck sheaves). For installations with cross-runway
     spans exceeding 61 meters (200 feet), replace the BAK-12 control valve cam to accommodate full
     runout of the system. Refer to T.O.s 35E8-2-5-1 and 35E8-2-5-4 to identify the part number for the
     correct replacement cam and installation procedures. Also, select a pendant length of between 80
     and 90 percent of the distance between the fairlead beams to avoid adverse cable dynamics.
     A2.2.4.3. Dual BAK-12 systems are special-purpose installations configured to accommodate
     high-energy engagements of aircraft ranging from 27,200 to 63,500 kilograms (60,000 to 140,000
     pounds). These configurations consist of 4 BAK-12 energy absorbers arranged in pairs on either
     side of the runway. The energy absorbers may be standard BAK-12s or be equipped with 72-inch
     diameter tape storage reels to accommodate 610 meters (2,000 feet) of runout. You need special
     tape connectors and edge sheaves for these installations. For details of these components and other
     special considerations, see section 8 of T.O. 35E8-2-5-1.

     A2.2.5. BAK-13. The BAK-13 (Figure A2.7.) is a bidirectional aircraft arresting system. It employs
     2 velocity-sensitive energy absorbers installed on opposite sides of the runway, interconnected by
     nylon purchase tapes and a 32-millimeter (1.25-inch) disc-supported pendant. The energy absorbers
     are made from a steel weldment base that incorporates a tape-storage reel mounted on a vertical shaft
     and a vaned rotor assembly enclosed within a vaned stator assembly (also called a tub) that contains a
     water and glycol mixture. A rewind engine, transmission assembly, and an operator control panel are
     also included along with necessary hydraulic system components.
        A2.2.5.1. The energy imparted during an aircraft arrestment converts to heat through the turbu-
        lence developed by rotation of the vaned rotor within the vaned stator. An external cooling reser-
        voir permits rapid cycle of this system.
        A2.2.5.2. Siting and grading requirements are provided in section 3 of T.O. 35E8-2-7-11, Opera-
        tion and Maintenance Instructions, Aircraft Arresting System, Type BAK-13A/F48A. The site
        requirements are essentially the same as for the BAK-12; however, the low-profile units may be
        located as close as 46 meters (150 feet) from the runway edge if installed in a semipermanent con-
        figuration. These systems require 290 meters (950 feet) plus the length of the aircraft for maxi-
        mum runout. The BAK-13 is not currently in production as a system. It should not be considered
        as a suitable system for a new requirement due to the potentially high hook loads generated during
        engagement.

     A2.2.6. BAK-14 and Type H Hook cable Support Systems.
        A2.2.6.1. The BAK-14 hook cable support system (Figure A2.8.) is a bidirectional hook cable
        (pendant) support system used in conjunction with the BAK-12, BAK-13, or a comparable arrest-
        ing system to engage and safely stop a hook-equipped aircraft. It provides the means to support the
        pendant at least 2 inches above the runway surface while giving ATC the means to lower the pen-
        dant below the surface of the runway to prevent damage to low-undercarriage aircraft, the pen-
        dant, and the pavement below the pendant during trampling. These systems can accommodate
        150, 200, and 300 foot-wide runways, but you order the system to suit the specific application.
        The control side BAK-12 pit or protective shelter and foundation must be expanded to house the
        compressed air and control systems needed to operate this supplemental system. The site and util-
        ity considerations for installation are in T.O. 35E8-2-8-1, Operation, Maintenance, and Installa-
        tion Instructions With Illustrated Parts Breakdown, Hook Cable Support System, Model BAK-14.
        A2.2.6.2. The Type H hook cable support system (Figure A2.9.) is a bi-directional hook cable
        support system that can be used in conjunction with any type of energy-absorbing device. It pro-
        vides a means to raise a cable at least 2 inches above a runway surface or lower it below the run-
        way surface in less than 1.5 seconds. It can be supplied to accommodate runway widths of 46, 60,
        and 90 meters (150, 200, and 300 feet). A radio remote control system provides ATC the means to
        operate the system and to monitor its operational status. It mainly consists of Retraction Modules
        (from 14 to 18, depending on runway width) installed into pre-cast concrete blocks across the run-
        way, and connected together by metallic rods, to form a rigid loop. This loop is actuated by an
        electro-hydraulic motor that is located in a concrete pit on one side of the runway. Detailed infor-
        mation (Description – Operation – Maintenance – IPL), are provided in AERAZUR Technical
        Manual 256-722, Type H45-200 Retractable Hook Cable System. Installation drawings are avail-
        able from the manufacturer.

Figure A2.9. Type H Hook Cable Support System.




     A2.2.7. BAK-15 (61QSII). The BAK-15 aircraft arresting barrier consists of a pair of electrohydrau-
     lically powered steel masts that provide support and remote-controlled movement for a unidirectional
     nylon net barrier (Figure A2.10.). The masts are installed on opposite sides of the runway overrun on
     concrete foundations. The ATC tower contains a remote-control panel, which can be hard-wired but
     most commonly is radio controlled.
        A2.2.7.1. The barrier must be augmented with an energy-absorbing device such as a ship's anchor
        chain, BAK-12, or Textile Brake. During an aircraft engagement, shear links in the net suspension
        straps separate by the force of the aircraft engaging the net. The net then envelops the aircraft and
        seats on the leading edge of the wings, transferring the forward momentum of the aircraft to the
        energy-absorbing device.
        A2.2.7.2. You can complement the system with a standard disc-supported pendant to accommo-
        date tail hook engagements through interconnect configuration hardware similar to that used for
        the MA-1A Modified. The hook cable interconnect kit is designated as the 62 NI (net intercon-
        nect). System operation and maintenance instructions are in T.O. 35E8-2-9-2, Maintenance and
        Operation Instructions, Quick Erect Stanchion System, Models 61QS and 61QSII. Obtain installa-
        tion drawings from the manufacturer through the procuring activity at the time of procurement.

   A2.2.8. Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS). The MAAS (Figure A2.11.) is essentially a
   BAK-12 aircraft arresting system mobilized through installation on a specially developed trailer. It is
   configured for a maximum aircraft runout of 302 meters (990 feet). This system was initially devel-
   oped and tested to accommodate recovery of fighter aircraft returning to a battle-damaged airfield.
60                                                        AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


     Such cases require rapid deployment and installation, and may require that only the minimum essen-
     tial anchoring hardware be installed to accommodate the above scenario. When installed for this pur-
     pose, the MAAS is installed using a 19-stake anchoring scheme. This configuration is limited to
     unidirectional engagement capability with a maximum aircraft weight and speed of 18,144 kilograms
     (40,000 pounds) at 150 knots (Table A2.1.). For detailed instructions on this system, refer to T.O.
     35E8-2-10-1, Operation and Maintenance Instructions, Arresting Systems, Aircraft, Mobile.

Figure A2.11. Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS) in Set-Back Configuration.




     A2.2.9. The MAAS can be upgraded to accommodate bi-directional engagements with the full capac-
     ity of a standard BAK-12 aircraft arresting system (Table A2.1.). This is accomplished by increasing
     the total number of cruciform stakes used to anchor the system from 19 to 31, extending the runout to
     366 meters (1,200 feet), and synchronizing the system for higher brake pressure. The system may also
     be installed in a set-back configuration to accommodate wide body aircraft operations through use of
AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                    61


  a fairlead beam (Figure A2.10.). For detailed information, see T.O. 35E8-2-10-1, Section VIII, Differ-
  ence Data Sheets.
  A2.2.10. Textile Brake. This modular arresting system is primarily intended as an emergency back up
  system for standard operational systems. It is comprised of multiple modules arranged in equal num-
  bers on both sides of the overrun that contain specially woven textile tearing straps to absorb the
  kinetic energy generated during an engagement. One end of each module is anchored to the ground
  and the other end is connected to a tensioned cable positioned across the runway. The system is avail-
  able in a 2-stage unidirectional configuration (Figure A2.13.) or as a single stage bi-directional sys-
  tem (Figure A2.13.). See Table A2.2. and T.O. 35E8-2-13-1, Textile Brake and Hook Cable Aircraft
  Arresting System, Type MB50.9.9.C, for information on the model MB 60.9.9.C. For information on
  the MB 100.10.C and MB 100.12.C, see Table A2.2. and Aerazur Technical Manuals 256-721, Textile
  Brake and Hook Cable Aircraft Arresting System, Model MB 100.10.C, and 256-726, Textile Brake
  and Hook Cable Aircraft Arresting System, Model MB 100.12.C. Note that the MB 100.12.C can pro-
  duce hook loads that exceed the working limit for pre Block 40 F-16 aircraft; therefore, it should not
  be used at installations that host this model aircraft (mission, tenant, or transient support). Block 40
  model F-16 and later, are fully compatible with the MB100.12 Textile Brake Arresting System.
     A2.2.10.1. The advantages of the 2-stage system (MB 60.9.9.C) over the MB 100.10.C bi-direc-
     tional system are higher system capacity and lower costs for reconfiguration after low energy
     engagements. The modules in a stage (breaking line) are expended upon aircraft engagement and
     must be replaced; however, a life cycle analysis indicates system costs are approximately 50 per-
     cent of the life cycle cost for a BAK-12 installed in the overrun area of a runway due to the low
     number of engagements that occur there. These systems are designed for tail-hook equipped
     fighter aircraft, but can also be complemented with a net barrier such as the BAK-15 or a net/cable
     interconnect system. They may also be configured for expeditionary or temporary installations.
     A2.2.10.2. If the bi-directional version of the Textile Brake arresting system is installed on the
     operational runway surface due to a non-standard length overrun, the Arresting Gear Marker
     (AGM) signs should be blanked when viewed from the approach. This is because the system is a
     low energy capacity system (compared with BAK-12 or BAK-13), and is not intended for
     approach end engagements.

     A2.2.11. Soft-Ground Type Aircraft Arresting Systems. The Engineered Material Arresting System
     (EMAS) is an FAA-approved soft-ground system normally used for civil airports to mitigate short
     safety areas (less than 305 meters [1,000 feet] long) at runway ends. The system is constructed of cel-
     lular foam concrete of specific strengths and thickness to decelerate an aircraft that overruns the run-
     way through rolling resistance. The design for each system is aircraft specific, based upon the type of
     aircraft that will use the runway. FAA AC 150/5220-22, Engineered Materials Arresting Systems
     (EMAS) for Aircraft Overruns, provides the design basis. It is intended for use where it is impractical
     to obtain the standard 305-meter (1000-foot) safety area and other alternatives are not feasible. See
     Figure A2.14. for layout of a typical soft ground type system. For purposes of design, the soft ground
     arrestor system can be considered fixed by function and frangible since it is designed to fail at a spe-
     cific impact load; therefore, a soft ground system is not considered an obstruction under Federal Avi-
     ation Regulation (FAR) 14 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable
AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                    63


   Airspace. Soft ground systems are located beyond the end of the runway, centered on the extended
   runway centerline. They will usually begin at some distance from the end of the runway to avoid dam-
   age due to jet blast or short landings. This distance will vary depending on the available area and the
   specific system design.

         TYPICAL ARRESTING SYSTEM AND BARRIER CONFIGURATIONS, AND
                             DECOMMISSIONING

A3.1. Configurations. The primary mission aircraft dictates the total number, type, and location of air-
craft arresting systems required. The owning MAJCOM of the tailhook-equipped aircraft (or aircraft com-
patible with net barrier systems) can determine through operational risk management, runway
configuration, proximity to other airfields, and other factors, that the typical configuration of both a run-
way and overrun system may not be required. Use the following examples for guidance:
   A3.1.1. A runway intended primarily for operating tactical or training tailhook-equipped aircraft
   should typically have an emergency system in each overrun and an operational system at each end of
   the runway for redundant capability. For some locations at forward operating bases or where snow and
   ice accumulation warrants, however, two operational systems may be necessary for each runway end
   and a midfield installation may be needed as well.
   A3.1.2. Runways that are prime divert facilities for bases operating tactical or training tail-
   hook-equipped aircraft should typically have an emergency system in each overrun and an operational
   system on each end of the primary runway.
   A3.1.3. Bases that are occasional hosts to arrestment-capable transient aircraft should have an emer-
   gency system installed in each overrun of the primary runway or an operational system on each end of
   the primary runway.

A3.2. Decommissioning. If the mission aircraft assigned to an installation does not require an arresting
system complex and removal will not have an impact on other USAF activities, consider decommission-
ing; however, follow coordination procedures in Chapter 1 first.

           SAMPLE LETTER OF AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL AVIATION
                            ADMINISTRATION (FAA)


AGREEMENT: The (FAA office and address) and (designated command) agree to the following provi-
sions for the operation and use of aircraft arresting equipment installed on (designated runway, airport
name, and address).
General Provisions:
   This agreement governs the use of arresting barriers and hook cable arresting systems for military air-
   craft and, in an emergency, for civil aircraft at pilot request.
   This agreement becomes effective when the tower chief receives written notice from the base com-
   mander that one of these situations applies:
       The arresting system has been accepted from the contractor and is commissioned and fully opera-
       tional.
       The arresting system is available for emergency use only. If the arresting system has not been
       accepted from the contractor, this notification must come with a written statement from the con-
       tractor authorizing emergency use of the system and waiving any claim against the FAA for dam-
       age to the system as the result of such use.
       A NOTAM has been issued specifying one of the above conditions. Before receiving the letter
       from the installation commander, the military crew deenergizes the tower arresting system con-
       trols and the chief controller labels them "Inoperative." Tower personnel may not energize the
       controls under any circumstances.
       Automatic arresting systems may be installed on the runway or in the overrun. Control tower per-
       sonnel raise or lower the barrier or hook cable through a remote-control panel in the control tower.
       Controllers operate the tower arresting system controls at the request of:
           The pilot of any military aircraft (regardless of the service concerned, type of aircraft, or
           nature of the operation).
           The pilot of a civil aircraft in an emergency, when in commission or emergency use status as
           described above.
           A mobile control unit, the base operations officer, or a designated representative.
       The military crew originates NOTAMs covering operational or outage status of a barrier or hook
       cable. During a NOTAM outage for repair or maintenance, tower personnel operate the controls,
       provided that the outage NOTAM contains the statement "available for emergency use" and the
       tower possesses a copy. Otherwise, the military crew deenergizes the tower controls and the chief
       controller labels them "Inoperative." In this event, tower personnel may not energize the controls
       under any circumstances.
       During the NOTAM outages due to failure of controls or when tower personnel advise of malfunc-
       tion of the system (see paragraph A5.2.8 for notice), the military crew at the system site has full
       and final responsibility for operating the arresting device. The arresting system crew maintains a
70                                                           AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


          listening watch on air and ground frequencies and has transmitting and receiving capability with
          the tower on the ground control frequency keeping personnel informed of the position of the sys-
          tem.
Operations:
     Typically, all military aircraft take off and land toward an operational arresting system in the "ready"
     configuration. The pilot asks the control tower operator to raise or lower the barrier or hook cable. For
     example, the pilot says "Duluth Tower, Joy 32 on base, gear down and locked, raise cable."
          For normal landings, the request involves the approach-end cable.
          For normal takeoffs, the request involves the departure-end barrier and cable.
     When tower personnel receive a request to raise or lower the barrier or cable, they must inform the
     pilot of the intended barrier or cable position as part of takeoff or landing information. For example,
     they say "Joy 32 cleared for takeoff, barrier indicates up."
     The pilot may request barrier or cable operating status at any time.
     The barrier and cable controls are in the down position except when pilots or other authorized person-
     nel request that either or both be raised.
     Tower personnel raise the departure-end barrier and both approach and departure-end cables for
     known or suspected radio failure landing by any military arrestment-capable aircraft. Activate the
     arresting system even if you doubt the aircraft's ability to engage the system.
     The standard phraseology for emergency requests to raise the barrier is "barrier, barrier, barrier." The
     standard phraseology for emergency requests to raise the cable is "cable, cable, cable."
     Tower personnel start normal crash procedures when an aircraft engages the barrier or cable if these
     procedures are not in progress.
     When there is a malfunction of the barrier, hook cable mechanism, or remote control system, the
     tower personnel notify base operations immediately.

                             EFFECTIVE PENDANT HEIGHT (EPH)

A6.1. General.
   A6.1.1. Pendant discs must have proper pavement support to ensure adequate clearance between the
   underside of the pendant cable and the runway surface. Adequate clearance increases the probability
   that the aircraft tailhook will successfully engage with the arresting system pendant cable.
   A6.1.2. The term for this clearance is the effective pendant height (EPH). The EPH is the vertical dis-
   tance (in millimeters or inches) from the underside of the pendant to a projected surface representing
   the original runway surface. The EPH for an undamaged or ungrooved runway surface is approxi-
   mately 60 millimeters (2.38 inches) for a 32-millimeter (1.25-inch) pendant cable and 64 millimeters
   (2.5 inches) for a 25-millimeter (1.0-inch) cable.

A6.2. EPH Measurements. Measure the EPH along the center third of the runway width at 3-meter
(10-foot) intervals or less using an EPH measuring tool (see Figure A6.1.). Manufacture the tool locally
for use by the power production shop.
   A6.2.1. Start measuring when you notice pavement erosion or grooving, and repeat measurements at
   least monthly. As the EPH approaches 38 millimeters (1.5 inches), take and record measurements
   daily.
   A6.2.2. Record EPH measurements in the arresting system maintenance log, using a sketch to dem-
   onstrate the EPH values and the distance to the location where the measurement was taken. Indicate
   the distance to the left and right of the runway centerline facing the runway approach.
   A6.2.3. Arresting system maintenance personnel must notify the commander's designated representa-
   tive when EPH measurements become necessary. Provide status reports as changes to the EPH occur.

A6.3. Pavement Repairs. Arrange for pavement repairs when any EPH measurement drops to 44 milli-
meters (1.75 inches) or less. Make the repair before the lowest EPH drops below 38 millimeters (1.5
inches). Perform emergency repairs (permanent or temporary) when any EPH measurement is less than
38 millimeters (1.5 inches).

A6.4. Notification of Reduced Engagement Reliability. When the EPH falls to less than 38 millime-
ters (1.5 inches), ask the airfield manager to issue an airfield advisory notifying pilots of the reduced
arresting system reliability.

                      OBTAINING A TEMPORARY ARRESTING SYSTEM

A7.1. For CONUS locations, submit requests for temporary use of expeditionary aircraft arresting sys-
tems to Headquarters Air Combat Command (HQ ACC) at least 2 months before the system must be in
place and operational. (Air National Guard units request support through the Air National Guard Civil
Engineer Technical Support Center (ANG/CETSC), Minot ND). Typically, HQ ACC only considers
requests to support CONUS locations. Coordinate overseas requirements through the appropriate MAJ-
COM (US Central Command (CENTAF), PACAF, or USAFE). Give the following information in all
requests:
   A7.1.1. Number of systems you need.
   A7.1.2. Reason you need the systems (including type of aircraft).
   A7.1.3. Geographic location of the requirement.
   A7.1.4. Date you need the systems to be operational.
   A7.1.5. Date the systems can be removed.
   A7.1.6. Point of contact and telephone number.

A7.2. In the request, specify the intended source and the number of qualified personnel who will operate
and maintain the expeditionary system at the site. Qualified personnel must attend the systems during all
hours of intended operation.

A7.3. The requesting activity must provide a fund citation to cover all costs associated with supporting
the expeditionary installation. Include costs for:
   A7.3.1. Shipment of the equipment.
   A7.3.2. Temporary duty.
   A7.3.3. Expendable materials.
   A7.3.4. Repair or replacement of damaged items.

          INSTALLATION OF ULTRA-HIGH-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT (UHMW)
      POLYETHYLENE PANELS UNDER AIRCRAFT ARRESTING SYSTEM CABLES
                          (CONUS INSTALLATIONS)

A8.1. Purpose. This attachment provides instructions for installation of UHMW polyethylene panels
under aircraft arresting system cables. It includes panel specifications and installation and inspection
guidelines.

A8.2. Application. Requirements of this guide are mandatory for new construction. Designers should
also consider thickened slabs under UHMW panels for new construction. Installation of UHMW panels is
the preferred method of repair for existing pavements. Other repair options may be justified based on
economy or mission.

A8.3. Specific Requirements. Aircraft arresting system cables impact underlying pavement, eroding
grooves in the pavement; the pendant support disks (donuts) supporting the cable sink into the grooves,
lowering the cable. When the EPH is below 38 millimeters (1.5 inches), the aircraft tailhook may miss the
cable. These areas must be repaired to maintain a uniform pavement surface and the proper EPH to ensure
reliability of the arresting system.

A8.4. Criteria for Repairs:
   A8.4.1. Materials must (1) install easily; (2) not warp or erode.
   A8.4.2. Method must be cost-effective.

A8.5. Options for Repair .
   A8.5.1. Bonded Partial-Depth Inlays. The Air Force has used numerous cementitious, epoxy, and
   polyurethane-based materials under arresting system cables. Performance varies from satisfactory to
   very poor, even with the same material. Most of these repairs have been costly and/or eroded quickly.
   A8.5.2. Preformed Panels. The Air Force has tested non-UHMW preformed panels with only limited
   success: panels warp and their edges protrude above the adjacent runway pavement, causing the air-
   craft tail-hook to skip over the cable. It is absolutely critical to keep panels flush, or preferably slightly
   recessed (1.6 to 3.2 millimeters [1/16- to 1/8-inch]) below the adjacent pavement surface. Thermal
   compatibility of the panel material, the anchoring system, and the adjacent pavement is extremely
   important.
       A8.5.2.1. When considering the installation of UHMW panels, it is important to verify thickness
       of the existing pavement. The panels must be anchored in a solid concrete bed. A typical anchor
       stud is 245 millimeters (95/8) inches long and the receiving slot is drilled slightly deeper. A mini-
       mum slab thickness of 280 millimeters (11 inches) is recommended to properly anchor the panels.
       A8.5.2.2. If the existing concrete is not thick enough, consider replacement with adequate thick-
       ness concrete prior to UHMW panel installation or alternative repair methods.
   A8.5.3. For installation in asphalt pavement, saw-cut and remove a 635-millimeter (25-inch) wide
   section of the asphalt as well as the underlying materials to a depth of 915 millimeters (3 feet). Back-
76                                                          AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


     fill the bottom of the trench with a well graded crushed stone material and compact to a 305-millime-
     ter (12-inch) thickness. Then pour the concrete foundation (approximately 570 millimeters [22.5
     inches] thick) for panel installation. Care must be taken to ensure that the concrete foundation is fin-
     ished level enough and at the proper depth for panel installation. Once the concrete is cured, proceed
     with installation and anchoring of panels as outlined in this publication.

     A8.6.2. Panel Dimensions and Anchor Stud Locations.
        A8.6.2.1. Panel Dimensions. Tolerance on panel length and width will be +/-3.2 millimeters (1/8
        inch). Panel thickness will not be greater than 38.1 millimeters (11/2 inches) or less than 36.5 mil-
        limeters (17/16 inch).
        A8.6.2.2. Anchor Stud Hole Locations and Dimensions. Each full-sized panel will have 6 anchor
        stud holes centered 102 millimeters (4 inches) from the edge of the panel. Each half-sized panel
        will have 4 anchor stud holes centered 102 millimeters (4 inches) from the edge of the panel. The
        anchor stud hole will be 1 inch for the through hole and 51 millimeters (2 inches) for the counter-
        sink hole. The countersink hole will be 22 millimeters (7/8-inch) deep with square shoulders for a
        flat washer to lay firmly against. Figure A8.1. shows dimensions and drilling details. Tolerances
        on dimensions for locations and diameters of anchor holes will be ± 1.6 millimeters (1/16-inch).
     A8.6.3. Holes for Cable Tie-down Anchors. The agency ordering panels will specify if cable
     tie-down anchor holes are required and will specify the number of panels that will be furnished with
     cable tie-down anchor holes. The cable tie-down anchor hole will be 102 millimeters (4 inches) in
     diameter and will be drilled completely through the panel. Cable tie-down anchor holes will be
     located in the center of the panel. The location of the cable tie-down anchor hole is shown in Figure
     A8.1. The number of tie-down anchors required should be provided by the MAJCOM aircraft arrest-
     ing system engineer. Cable tie-downs will not be located closer than 610 millimeters (2 feet) from
     existing pavement joints. Half-sized panels will not receive holes for cable tie-down anchors.

A8.7. Material.
     A8.7.1. The panels will be fabricated from virgin and/or recycled UHMW polyethylene and will be
     black in color and be UV-stabilized. An antistatic additive will be added to the UHMW polyethylene.

                                      Method A (see Note)
NOTE: The test specimens must have 2 opposing 15-degree notches.

A8.8. Guidelines for Panel Sizing and Preparation .
   A8.8.1. Panel Dimensions: Uncut panel stock is 1,220 millimeters (48 inches) wide by 3,048 milli-
   meters (10 feet) long by 38 millimeters (11/2 inches) thick. Size panels to avoid material waste.
   A8.8.2. Length. Cut panels to allow joints between panels to line up with runway pavement joints.
   For runways with slabs sized in 1,524-millimeter (5-foot) increments, such as those having 6-meter
   (20-foot) or 7.6-meter (25-foot) longitudinal paving lane joint spacing, panels should be 1,511 milli-
   meters (4 feet, 111/2 inches) long. (Two panels can be cut from the 3,048-millimeter [10-foot] long
   stock with minimal waste.) Panels may be shorter, but must never exceed 1,524 millimeters (5 feet).
   Recommended joint space between panels is 13 millimeters (1/2 inch). In all cases, particularly at
   overseas installations, the existing slab sizes should be verified before ordering materials and the pan-
   els should be sized so that the joints between panels line up with the existing pavement joints. Panels
   should never straddle pavement joints and should not be positioned in a way that would allow the
   anchor studs to fall in existing pavement joints.
   A8.8.3. Width. To reduce panel warping and damage to joints from cable impact, panels should be a
   nominal 610 millimeters (24 inches) wide for all installations.
   A8.8.4. Thickness. Panel thickness should not be less than 36.5 millimeters (17/16 inches) nor more
   than 38.1 millimeters (11/2 inches).
   A8.8.5. Panel Finishing. The panel supplier should predrill holes in panels (for anchor stud installa-
   tion) in accordance with Figure A8.1.

     A8.8.6. The MAJCOM aircraft arresting system engineer will specify the required number and spac-
     ing of tie-down anchors. If cable tie-down anchors are used, the supplier should predrill panel centers
     with 102-millimeter (4-inch) diameter holes to allow anchor installation.

A8.9. Guidelines for Pavement Preparation and UHMW Panel Installation.
     A8.9.1. The procedure to install UHMW panels under arresting system cables involves the following
     major steps:
        A8.9.1.1. Preparing the receiving slot.
        A8.9.1.2. Placing a cementitious setting bed.
        A8.9.1.3. Installing the UHMW panels.
        A8.9.1.4. Installing panel anchor studs.
        A8.9.1.5. Installing new cable tie-down anchors (if required).

      A8.9.1.6. Sealing the joints.
   A8.9.2. Preparing the Receiving Slot.
      A8.9.2.1. Remove Concrete. Dimensions of the area of concrete removed depend upon the num-
      ber of panels installed. For example, if each panel is 1,511 millimeters (591/2 inches) long by 610
      millimeters (24 inches) wide, the gap between panels is 13 millimeters (1/2 inch). Therefore, for a
      12-meter (40-foot) long inlay of 8 panels (across the runway, 6 meters [20 feet] on each side of the
      runway centerline), the saw cut area must be:
          A8.9.2.1.1. 12.2 meters (40 feet, 1/2 inch) long
          A8.9.2.1.2. 635 millimeters (25 inches) wide
          A8.9.2.1.3. At least 64 millimeters (21/2 inches) deep.
          A8.9.2.1.4. An installation extending completely across a 46-meter (150-foot) wide runway
          requires 30 panels.
      A8.9.2.2. Perimeter Cuts. Perimeter saw cuts must be 76 millimeters (3 inches) deep and overlap
      at least 76 millimeters (3 inches) to ensure that corners are perfectly square when pavement is
      removed. Remove all loose, unsound concrete within the area. Additional saw cuts inside the
      perimeter will make removing the concrete easier (using chipping hammers), and result in a more
      uniform concrete profile.
      A8.9.2.3. Inspect Receiving Slot Following Concrete Removal. With a notched board (Figure
      A8.2.), check the depth of the concrete within the recessed setting bed. Use a chipping hammer to
      remove any portions less than 64 millimeters (21/2 inches) from the surface of the adjacent pave-
      ment. Then check the concrete visually; sound it with a steel rod to identify any unsound portions;
      and remove all unsound concrete.

Figure A8.2. Notched Board Used to Check the Receiving Slot.




      A8.9.2.4. Remove Existing Tie-down Anchors. Cut existing aircraft arresting system cable
      tie-down anchors flush with the bottom of the concrete substrate before placing the setting bed.
      A8.9.2.5. Clean Concrete Substrate. Upon removal of concrete from the slot, it is important to
      adequately clean the slot to ensure that the new setting bed material will adhere to the substrate.
      Particular care should be taken to remove the laitance from the smooth faces of the sawcut walls.
      Sandblast or use wire brushes, followed by compressed air.
80                                                          AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


     A8.9.3. Placing a Setting Bed. Place a cementitious setting bed under the panels and allow the bed to
     cure before drilling and anchoring the panel anchor studs. Use ordinary Portland cement concrete; air-
     field strength (34,474 kPa [5,000 psi] compression/4,482 kPa [650 psi] flexural strength in 28 days)
     when several hours' cure time is available.
        A8.9.3.1. As a suggested mix, use:
            A8.9.3.1.1. A lean 7-bag mix with10-millimeter (3/8-inch) maximum size aggregate.
            A8.9.3.1.2. Water-to-cement ratio not to exceed 0.3 : 1.
            A8.9.3.1.3. Plasticizer admixture.
            A8.9.3.1.4. Substitute fly ash for -50 sieve size sand as required.
            A8.9.3.1.5. This mixture will allow drilling within 18 to 24 hours. For short-cure-time appli-
            cations, a prepackaged material such as Rapid Set® Concrete Mix is satisfactory. Rapid Set
            Concrete Mix is packaged in 27-kilogram (60-pound) bags that will yield approximately 0.014
            m3 (0.5 cubic foot) of concrete when mixed with water (refer to Table A8.3. for ordering
            information). Placing a small test sample in a disposable pail the same depth as the setting bed
            may also serve as a helpful tool in determining adequate cure time for drilling operations.
        A8.9.3.2. Mixing Equipment Placement. Position 2 mechanical mortar or concrete mixers
        approximately 6 meters (20 feet) from the prepared inlay near the center of the runway. Transport
        mixed mortar in a wheelbarrow. Mortar mixers are preferred. Depending upon the type material
        used, drum mixers may not agitate the material enough to produce the desired workability when
        the recommended amount of water is used.
            A8.9.3.2.1. Mixing and Placing Procedure for Rapid Set Concrete Mix. Place 2.8 to 3.8 liters
            (3 to 4 quarts) of water in the mixer. In hot climates, using cold water can extend the setting
            time of the mix. In cold climates, using hot water and heating the substrate may shorten the
            setting time.
            A8.9.3.2.2. Add 1 bag of Rapid Set Concrete Mix and mix for 2 to 3 minutes. Place the mate-
            rial within 10 minutes after mixing. If temperature is above freezing, wet the substrate first. If
            below freezing, do not wet the substrate.
        A8.9.3.3. Finish the material from the center of the bed to the edges to achieve proper bonding
        along the side walls of the excavation.
        A8.9.3.4. After initial set, when the surface becomes hard to the touch, fog or spray mist cure with
        water for one hour. Note that this mix "wets" slowly. Do not add more water until the full mixing
        time has elapsed. Over-wetting will weaken the final mix.
     A8.9.4. Leveling the Setting Bed. Mechanically vibrate or jitterbug the concrete before screeding to
     consolidate the mass. Even simple hand tamping with a garden rake greatly reduces the percent of
     voids in the mix. Level the concrete to the proper depth in the setting bed using a notched screed board
     (Figure A8.3.). Strike the screed periodically to ensure proper depth and uniform surface. The
     39.7-millimeter (19/16-inch) depth of the screed board is based upon a panel thickness of 38 millime-
     ters (11/2 inches). Measure the actual thickness of each panel upon delivery to ensure that they are all
     the same thickness and to establish the required screed dimensions. The setting bed must be level and
     of the proper depth to correctly support the panels. A properly placed setting bed will help avoid a lot
     of aggravating manual labor. A setting bed that is not level or is placed at an improper depth requires
AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                        81


   excessive grinding of the pavement and/or shims, or may require grinding of the adjacent pavement
   surfaces. Shims should be used as a last resort, not planned into the job. When required, the shim stock
   should be a nonferrous metal and should be sized to provide full surface support for the panel, not just
   point support at the anchor locations.

Figure A8.3. Notched Screed.




   A8.9.5. Extend existing pavement joints through the setting bed by saw-cutting or using an expansion
   board. The saw cut should be a single blade-width and extend completely through the setting bed.
   Expansion boards must be set the full depth of the setting bed.

A8.10. Installing UHMW Panels. Install panels in accordance with the following:
   A8.10.1. Allow the setting bed to harden (approximately 4 hours, depending on the type bed used) to
   the minimum strength that allows drilling without spalling the concrete.
   A8.10.2. Lay the panels in place and inspect to ensure that the top surface of the panel is at least 1.6
   millimeters (1/16-inch) lower than the adjacent pavement surface. Grind the bedding material or panel
   edges as necessary so that the panel surface is slightly recessed (1.6 to 3.2 millimeters [1/16 to 1/8
   inch]) below the adjacent pavement surface. Panel height is especially critical in the center half of the
   runway.
   A8.10.3. Set spacing between panels using a13-millimeter (1/2-inch) thick board and secure all panels
   in place with wood wedges (minimum 4 sets per panel) to prevent panels shifting during drilling of
   anchor stud holes. UHMW panels contract and expand greatly with temperature changes. The panels
   should be placed and anchored at the medium temperature for the given location to allow for move-
   ment either way with temperature changes.

A8.11. Installing Panel Anchor Studs. (For a list of required tools and equipment, reference Table
A8.2.)
   A8.11.1. Drill Holes. Position locally fabricated alignment tool (Figure A8.4.) over each predrilled
   hole in the panel and drill 22-millimeter (7/8-inch) diameter holes in setting bed. Not all anchor studs
   are consistent in length as ordered, so check actual anchor stud lengths and drill to accommodate the
   longest stud. The hole depth is critical. If it is not deep enough, the stud will protrude above the panel
   surface and require excessive grinding. If it is too deep, the adhesive capsule will be positioned below
   the stud and not provide adequate coverage. Use a drill-mounted depth gage rod or mark a position on
   the drill bit shaft the length of the stud plus the depth of the alignment tool to ensure proper hole depth
   when drilling.
82                                                            AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


Figure A8.4. Alignment Tool (Anchor Drill Guide).




     A8.11.2. Clean Drilled Holes. Thoroughly clean debris from the drilled hole with a round wire brush
     and compressed air. A 9- to 13-millimeter (3/8- to 1/2-inch) diameter tube attached to the compressed
     air line is necessary to remove all fines from the holes. Insert tubing to the bottom of the hole to ensure
     all particles are removed.
     A8.11.3. Install Anchor Studs. Install each anchor stud as described below. To avoid work stoppage
     while adhesive cures, have at least 12 cap nuts available for setting anchors.
        A8.11.3.1. Insert an adhesive capsule into each hole with the rounded end facing the bottom of
        the hole. Screw a cap nut (or other manufacturer-provided adapter) onto the end of the anchor bolt
        and attach the unit to a heavy-duty drill (or rotary impact hammer). Insert a flat washer onto the
        threaded stud just below the adapter, or position the washer over the panel hole inside the counter-
        sink. Drive the anchor stud slowly to the end of the hole and continue slowly rotating the stud in
        the hole for approximately 15 seconds to mix the adhesive and work it up the anchor. Once the
        anchor stud is in position, do not disturb it until the adhesive is cured. Allow the adhesive to cure
        (approximately 1 hour or as recommended by the manufacturer) to the point where the cap nut can
        be removed without disturbing the stud position.
        A8.11.3.2. Remove cap nut and flat washer; seal around stud with silicone sealant; reinsert flat
        washer; attach lock washer and nut to top of anchor stud.
        A8.11.3.3. Allow adhesive to fully cure according to manufacturer's instructions and then torque
        the nuts to 81 Nm (60 foot-pounds).
        A8.11.3.4. Grind off any portion of a stud that protrudes above the panel surface.
     A8.11.4. Installing New Cable Tie-down Anchors. The MAJCOM aircraft arresting system engineer
     will prescribe the number and spacing of cable tie-down anchors required. Each cable tie-down
     anchor hole will be located in the center of the appropriate installed panel. When installing cable
     tie-downs, ensure the top of the tie-down is at least 5 millimeters (3/16 inch) (recommend 13 millime-
     ters [1/2 inch]) below the final panel surface height. Depending on the location of existing runway
     pavement joints in relation to the runway centerline and the longitudinal joint spacing, UHMW panels
     may be installed with a panel joint or panel center falling on the runway centerline. Figure A8.5.
     through Figure A8.9. depict recommended cable anchor tie-down locations when installing standard
AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                   83


   full-sized and half-sized panels in various slab sizes. The half-sized panels are required to permit
   acceptable tie-down spacing and to avoid overlapping joints in the existing slabs. For installation in
   slabs sized other than those shown, consult the MAJCOM aircraft arresting system engineer. Use
   8-point tie-down configurations for F-16 aircraft operations. Use 4-point configurations for all other
   aircraft operations.

   A8.11.5. Sealing Joints. Apply joint sealant in spacing between and around panel edges, recessed
   6.35 mm (1/4-inch) below the panel top surface. Joint sealants do not adhere well to UHMW panels
   and joints should be inspected frequently. Silicone sealants should be used in lieu of hot-pour asphalt
   or tar sealants. Silicone sealants are suitable for climates with wide temperature ranges and develop a
   low elastic modulus which allows good extension and compression recovery. This is important in light
   of the contraction and expansion properties of the panels.
       A8.11.5.1. The size of the backer rod is also complicated due to the expansion properties of the
       panels. The spaces between panels should be noted while the panels are in their contracted state to
       prevent installation of undersized backer rods that allow the sealant to flow underneath.
       A8.11.5.2. A non-shrinkable, non-absorbent, highly compressible foam backer rod should be
       used, sized to span the maximum expected gap, but placed at the medium temperature, and set at
       a depth to ensure a proper shape factor is created for the sealant reservoir.
   A8.11.6. Joints should be resealed just prior to onset of cold weather to prevent moisture accumula-
   tion and freezing below panels. Freezing below panels may result in panel failure, anchor failure, or
   excessive panel warping.

A8.12. Guidelines for Inspection. Bases should establish formal procedures to ensure satisfactory per-
formance of UHMW panels. UHMW panels should be inspected daily and monthly for effects of aircraft
traffic and thermal movement (expansion/contraction/warping) in accordance with the following.
88                                                         AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


     A8.12.1. Daily Inspection. Panel inspection should be added to the daily arresting system inspection
     by power production personnel. Visually check for panel buckling, warping, and surface variations.
     A8.12.2. Weekly Inspection. Check for panel buckling, warping, and surface variations by placing a
     steel straight edge on top of each panel parallel to the runway centerline at:
        A8.12.2.1. Each joint between panels.
        A8.12.2.2. At least two locations within each panel.
        A8.12.2.3. Any other location that appears raised or irregular.
        A8.12.2.4. The straight edge must be long enough to overlap the pavement on each side of the
        panel by a minimum of 305 millimeters (12 inches). Immediately report raised edges or high spots
        exceeding 3.2 millimeters (1/8-inch) above the plane of the adjacent runway to the base pavements
        engineer and to the MAJCOM arresting systems engineer for further evaluation. Take color slides
        or photographs to document findings.
     A8.12.3. Monthly Inspection. The base pavements engineer should participate once each month in
     the daily inspections with the power production personnel. Record all panel conditions, including (but
     not limited to):
        A8.12.3.1. Erosion/EPH.
        A8.12.3.2. Distresses.
        A8.12.3.3. Warping/curling.
        A8.12.3.4. Soundness.
        A8.12.3.5. Delamination.
        A8.12.3.6. Anchor stud effectiveness.
        A8.12.3.7. Joint seal performance.
        A8.12.3.8. Spalling.
        A8.12.3.9. Anchor stud nuts may be over-torqued if tightened repeatedly. Consider using a thread
        locking or seizing compound such as Loctite® on nuts that continually loosen. Report any signifi-
        cant deterioration or problem to the MAJCOM immediately for further evaluation.

Table A8.4. Typical Schedule of Events (For Installation of 8 Panels).
 Date     Times         Event Description
 24 Jun 1800-2200       Perimeter saw cutting, Runway 33. Crew size 2 men. Saw cuts 76
                        millimeters (3 inches) deep.
 25 Jun 1500-1745       Excavation starts on Runway 33 inlay. Crew size 9 men. Concrete
                        removed using three 40-kilogram (90-pound) jackhammers and one cold
                        milling cutter drum on a "Bobcat 843" skid-steer loader. Debris loaded
                        into a dump truck using a front end loader. Large rubble removed by
                        hand and shovel; small debris removed using the suction wand of the
                        "Tymco" airfield sweeper.
 25 Jun 1745-1915       Excavation is complete. Slot cleaned with high pressure air. Substrate
                        sounded and delaminated (unsound, hollow) material removed.
                        Approximate final slot size: 30 meters (100 feet) long by 635
                        millimeters (25 inches) wide by 76 millimeters (3 inches) deep. Notched
                        depth gauge board used to check depth in the center 12.2-meter (40-foot)
                        area where panels are to be installed.
 25 Jun 1915-2000       Final slot inspection. Loose hollow-sounding areas removed with
                        jackhammer and pick. (Hand-held hammer and steel chisel may also be
                        used.) Slot side walls cleaned with wire brushes. Slot cleaned and dried
                        with high pressure air.
 25 Jun 2000-2230       Mixing and placing of the setting bed begins. Both concrete mixers used.
                        Ten-person crew is used. No bonding agent used or needed. Notched
                        board used to keep the setting bed at the correct level below the
                        surrounding pavement surface.
 25 Jun 2030-2242       Curing compound applied periodically as the setting bed is placed.
 25 Jun 2242-2300       Cleanup accomplished and runway cleared. Approximately 90 bags of
                        mortar placed.
 26 Jun 0855-1030       Joints and cracks saw-cut through the mortar patches, both flush and
                        recessed patch areas. Hand-held portable saw used for recessed setting
                        bed cracks/joints and self-propelled pavement saw used for flush
                        patches.
AFI32-1043_USAFESUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                      93


 Date     Times           Event Description
 26 Jun   1015-1045       Panel placement begins. Panels positioned and tightly wedged into place
                          using wood spacers and wood shims (wedges). Panels as ordered for the
                          job have predrilled bolt holes.
 26 Jun   1050-1130       Drilling bolt holes begins. Three heavy-duty electric impact drills (two
                          Hilti HE72, one Milwaukee) used and work well. Three minutes drilling
                          time per hole required. Portable drill alignment tool used to keep drill bit
                          positioned vertically to start hole. Drill bits marked with tape to control
                          hole depth. Long slender tube inserted completely to bottom of bolt
                          holes delivers compressed air to thoroughly clean holes. Recommended
                          wire brushing of holes is not accomplished.
 26 Jun   1130-1345       Panel anchor studs set in position using electric drill with adapter
                          attachment. Anchor studs anchored into pavement with adhesive capsule
                          inserted before inserting anchor stud in hole. Installation of anchors is
                          delayed during first hour while new adapter is fabricated locally for
                          anchor installation. After first adapter is tried and proven, two more
                          adapters are fabricated. Anchor stud installation then progresses rapidly
                          with most anchor studs installed in last hour. Applying oil on ends of
                          studs aids adapter removal after stud installation.
 26 Jun   1340-1400       Shims removed. Site cleaned with compressed air to remove all particles
                          before sealing around panels with joint sealant.
 26 Jun   1710-1730       Studs torqued to 81 Nm (60 foot-pounds) with torque wrenches. All
                          studs torqued adequately, but several stud ends protrude above panel
                          surface.
 26 Jun   1810-1820       High studs ground down flush with surface using a heavy-duty disc-type
                          electric grinder.
 26 Jun   1720-1820       Sealant applied to joints around panels using kettle with hot applied
                          single component non-jet fuel resistant sealant (SS-S-1401). Job
                          complete.
 26 Jun   1820-1830       Final inspection and job site cleanup completed.
