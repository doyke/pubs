Publications and Forms Management.

       This memorandum becomes void after one-year has elapsed from the date of this memorandum,
or upon publication of an Interim Change to, or rewrite of the 51 FWI 31-104, whichever is earlier. The

                                              Guidance Changes

(Add New) 3.1.7. Osan AB only. Vehicle, Motorcycle, and Scooter/Moped registration is not allowed
for TDY personnel. Only permanent party personnel stationed at Osan AB or associated collocated
operating bases (COBs) will be allowed to register motor vehicles.

(Replace) 4.2.1. Refer to USFKR 190-1, Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, Appendix C and AFI 31-
218(I), Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, Chapter 5.

(Replace) 4.3.2. Unit commanders will be notified via email from 51SFS/S5R no later than five duty
days from the date of the citation. The unit commander will notify the alleged offender and conduct an
inquiry to determine if the alleged violation occurred.

(Replace) 4.4.2. Individuals who wish to rebut a citation must notify 51 SFS/S5R within 5 duty days of
the receipt of the citation with the intent to rebut. Rebuttals must be submitted in writing within 14
calendar days from the date of the citation. The request must include the endorsement and
recommendation of the unit commander. The right to rebut a citation is automatically forfeited if a
request is not submitted within the time allowed.

(Replace) 5.1.6. While on base, personnel may be transported in the cargo area of a truck if the vehicle is
equipped with permanent side rails and a tailgate. All fixed seats with occupant restraints must be used
before using the cargo area for transport. When using the cargo area, members will sit with their backs
against fixed, non-movable sides. No personnel are authorized to ride sitting against a tailgate. Transport
is limited to short distances on base. When traveling off the installation, personnel must utilize fixed
seats with occupant restraints. Personnel are not authorized to ride in the cargo area of Low-Speed
Vehicles (LSVs).

(Replace) 5.1.11. When operating a government vehicle in reverse, the driver will use due care as follows.
Vehicles will not back up in such a way as to interfere with other traffic. The distance an operator may back
up a motor vehicle will be the absolute minimum needed to negotiate a turn. The driver of a government
vehicle will always back into a parking space when parking. The driver will exhaust all means to locate and
utilize a spotter when backing up during low visibility or any time line of sight may be obstructed. If two or
more personnel are in the vehicle, at least one or more individual(s) will act as a spotter regardless of the
circumstances. Prior to initiating any vehicle motion, drivers and spotters will ensure the immediate area is
clear of any vehicles, personnel or obstructions. Spotters will maintain a clear line of sight with the driver at
all times. Spotters will remain in place until the driver has completed backing or any other activity that
requires the use of a spotter. If a spotter is not available after exhausting all means, the driver will walk
around the vehicle, check for obstructions, and honk the horn two to three times before moving in order to
alert nearby personnel. The driver will also utilize four-way flashers (if available) while backing during low
visibility to alert any vehicles and personnel in the immediate area of the maneuver. If possible all drivers
will position/park vehicles by backing and heading out rather than heading in and backing out.

 (Replace) 5.6.2.1. Bicyclists and Segways will ride as near to the right side of the roadway as practical
and will follow the same traffic safety rules as motor vehicles, e.g. one-way roads and stop signs. Note:
Segway riders are required to wear the same personal protective equipment (PPE) as bicyclists, such as
helmet and reflective vest, as outlined in section 5.6.1.

(Delete) 5.6.2.3.

(Replace) 6.7.3.1. If it can be determined who was driving the restricted vehicle when it was illegally
parked in a restricted parking zone, then the driver will be issued the suspension. If the driver cannot be
determined, then the registered vehicle owner will be issued the suspension.
(Replace to Figure A4.1., ETP FOR 2ND VEHICLE) Attachment 4, Figure A4.1., Unaccompanied
E-5/E-6 POV Reg with Restricted Parking Privileges.

SUBJECT: Exception to Policy for Second Vehicle

1. I am requesting an exception to policy in accordance with USFKR 190-1, Paragraph 5-3, a,
(2), for authorization to register a second vehicle in my name. My current DEROS is _____.
Ensure that the reasoning for the exception to policy is justifiable and include any information
that is beneficial to the needs of the military. You should be aware there are no guarantees an
exception to policy will be granted, therefore, please do not make decisions based on its approval
such as purchasing a second vehicle to register under the SOFA agreement.

2. (Your Justification) You should also be aware that it may take up to 30 days for coordination
of exceptions to policy to be completed. Consequently, do not wait until the last minute to
submit an exception to policy letter. Pass and Registration is the point of contact for all exception
to policy letters concerning Pass and Registration issues. Please DO NOT ATTEMPT TO
BYPASS PASS AND REGISTRATION WHEN ROUTING EXCEPTION TO POLICY
LETTERS in an effort to save time or deliver the letters directly to the Mission Support Group
Deputy Commander’s office. All requests must be coordinated through Pass and Registration
and failure to submit your request through this office may result in longer processing time.

3. If an exception of policy is approved and granted, I understand we must comply with all
requirements contained within USFKR 190-1, and any other local requirements.

4. If you have any questions, please contact me at XXX-XXXX or via e-mail at

possesses a USFK Form 134EK, United States Forces Korea (USFK) Motor Vehicle Operators
Permit will be authorized to drive/operate a motor vehicle on the peninsula. A valid United
States issued state driver’s license may be used as a temporary permit for 30 days after initial
arrival in the Republic of Korea (ROK). In order to obtain a motor vehicle license the operator
must show proof of one of the following forms of identification prior to obtaining a US Military
driver license:
   2.1.1. US driver’s license.

    2.3.1. Implied consent to blood, breath, or urine tests. Individuals who operate a motor
    vehicle on Osan AB automatically give their consent to chemical tests for alcohol or drug
    content of their blood, breath, or urine. It is implied that, if lawfully stopped, apprehended or
    cited for an offense committed while driving or in control of a motor vehicle, the individual
    has given "implied consent" to the search of their person. An individual's refusal under the
    "Implied Consent" provision will automatically result in a one-year revocation of driving
    privileges.

    unattended in a restricted or controlled area, or abandoned. The owner also agrees to
    reimburse the United States for the cost of towing and storage should their motor vehicle be
    removed or impounded. Existence of these conditions will be determined by the installation
    commander or designee.
    2.3.3. Motor vehicle or criminal infraction. Any person who operates, registers, or is in
    control of a motor vehicle on a military installation involved in a motor vehicle or criminal

                             MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION

3.1. Authorization Criteria.
   3.1.1. Definition: A motor vehicle is any motor-driven vehicle manufactured primarily for
   use on a public street, road, or highway. Mopeds, bicycles, and scooters with a motorized
   engine, regardless of engine size, are considered motor vehicles.
   3.1.2. SOFA/Non-SOFA personnel employees (Vendor, Korean GS employees, ROK
   military, etc) are authorized to have an Osan AB registered vehicle if they meet the minimum
   pay grade requirement of KGS-07/KWB-09 and above. This will be verified via military
   orders, letter of employment or USFK Form 700-19A-R-E, Invited Contractor and Technical
   Representative Personnel Date Report. Korean personnel that wish to register a motorcycle
   or moped must comply with the same safety and licensing standards as SOFA personnel and
   local Civilian Personnel Office policies.
   3.1.3. All E-7 and above military personnel, all Command-Sponsored accompanied
   personnel regardless of rank, and all US civilian employees with the pay grade GS-05 and
   above are authorized to register one motor vehicle.
   3.1.4. Motorcycles are treated as motor vehicles per USFKR 190-1 for the purpose of the
   one-duty free rule; however, a single motorcycle does not count towards the number of
   vehicles that can be registered. Thus, a person meeting all other requirements may register a
   motorcycle as a second motor vehicle without obtaining an ETP. If a second motorcycle is
   requested, an ETP must be submitted, see paragraph 3.3. The family must have at least one
   licensed rider per motorcycle. Generally, these requests will be approved regardless of the
   number of 4-wheel motor vehicles the family is allowed since motorcycles are used mostly
   for recreation, are not used year-round, and must be parked only in designated motorcycle
   areas.
   3.1.5. Civilian employees who are dependents of command sponsored personnel are only
   authorized to register a vehicle with an approved ETP for “RESTRICTED” vehicles.
   3.1.6. Military couples with individual travel orders authorizing shipment of a motor vehicle
   at no expense to the owner are authorized to register one vehicle per person.
3.2. Registration Process.
   3.2.1. All authorized motor vehicles will be registered with the 51 SFS Pass & Registration
   Office within 10 days after the vehicle is received from a port of entry, motor vehicle pickup
   point, purchased, or otherwise legally acquired. Vehicles that do not comply with this
   regulation will not be registered or issued a USFK Registration decal.
   3.2.2. The USFK Form 31EK-E, Application for Registration of USFK Privately Owned
   vehicle, will be accomplished to register a motor vehicle. Vehicle registrations are valid for
   three years or DEROS, whichever expires first. All vehicle registrations will be entered into
   the Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS).
   3.2.3. Before an initial registration, Privately Owned Vehicles (POVs) must pass a safety
   inspection conducted within the last 30 days, at a USFK certified motor vehicle mechanical
 10                                                               51FWI31-104 5 APRIL 2013


   safety inspection facility. POVs must undergo safety inspection and emission testing every
   two years thereafter, unless ownership changes.
   3.2.4. The only exception to the safety inspection requirement is for vehicles less than two
   years old as determined by the manufacture date or model year, whichever is older. The
   exception for these vehicles will be valid for two years from manufacture date.
   3.2.5. SOFA registered vehicles, cars, motorcycles and mopeds must also be registered at the
   Pyeongtaek Vehicle Registration Office, including vehicles with an engine displacement of
   49cc or below. If a KGS has a motorcycle, he/she does not have to register it at Pyeongtaek.
3.3. Exceptions to Policy (ETP).
   3.3.1. No person will register more than one motor vehicle on Osan AB unless the individual
   obtains an approved ETP. Requests to register a second vehicle are generally not authorized
   unless the member can substantiate a financial hardship or other extraordinary circumstances.
   The following criteria will be used to evaluate an ETP request for a second vehicle.
   3.3.2. Military sponsor will be assigned to a command sponsored billet.
   3.3.3. Family will live off-base. On-base families will not be approved for a second vehicle
   due to the close proximity of base support facilities.
   3.3.4. Sponsor should work extended, non-standard, or abnormal hours, or be subject to
   special mission related recalls (not just normal exercise recalls) that prevent the primary
   vehicle from being available for use by the spouse or dependents.
   3.3.5. Spouse or alternate driver typically works in the local community or at other military
   installations or otherwise requires independent transportation.        Special or unusual
   requirements must be fully justified.
   3.3.6. Special consideration will be given to families that have school aged children and
   reside outside the normal DODEA school bus routes.
   3.3.7. Contractors will not be authorized to register an additional 4-wheeled vehicle.
   3.3.8. Unaccompanied E-6 and below personnel approved to live off-base due to
   unavailability of on-base quarters may be authorized to register one motor vehicle. The
   request must be approved by the unit commander before being submitted to Pass and
   Registration.
   3.3.9. All ETP vehicles will be registered as “RESTRICTED PARKING ONLY” and will
   only be allowed to park in specific areas. See Attachment 3 Area V Restricted Parking
   Areas.

   3.4.1. All US government owned or leased non-tactical vehicles (NTVs) that are licensed for
   operations on public roadways will be issued a bar-coded DBIDS vehicle registration decal.
   51 SFS/S5P will place the decal on the Government Owned Vehicle (GOV). The DBIDS
   vehicle registration decal will be displayed on the lower left corner of the windshield. The
   DBIDS NTV vehicle decal will remain valid as long as the US Government retains
   ownership of the vehicle.
   3.4.2. Contract vehicles will be registered for the length of the contract on the USFK Form
   700-19A-R-E. Vehicle access will be associated with personal access. As such, the vehicle
   registration decal will expire concurrently with the USFK Form 37EK, USFK Pass/ID and
   the vehicle registration documents.
   3.4.3. The 51 MSG/CD will not approve permanent vehicle registration documents for short-
   term leased or rented vehicles. USFK Form 192EK, Temporary Vehicle Pass, will be used
   for access by these vehicles. Vehicle registration documents may be issued for long-term
   leases of 6 months or longer.
3.5. Registration Decals.
   3.5.1. Vehicles properly registered and displaying an USFK vehicle registration decal may
   be granted access to authorized USFK installations IAW the DBIDS access authorization of
   owner/operator. In order to obtain appropriate vehicle access documents, owners must obtain
   approval to register and operate the vehicle on USFK installations IAW USFKR 190-7,
   Installation Access Control.
   3.5.2. All SOFA POV owners will deregister, or make legal arrangements for deregistration
   of their vehicles before permanently departing from this command by reporting to the local
   Provost Marshall Office (PMO) or Security Forces Office for a vehicle registration clearance
   check.
   3.5.3. Pass & Registration is responsible for affixing a USFK vehicle registration decal to
   the vehicle, provided the vehicle owner has a valid safety inspection certificate. The decal
   will be affixed to the inside of the vehicles bottom left corner of the front windshield. When
   a motor vehicle is sold to another authorized individual, the buyer must ensure a new
   registration decal is affixed after reregistering the vehicle. Applicants must bring their
   vehicle and registration paperwork to Bldg 765 where 51 SFS/S5P will affix and/or dispose
   of registration decals. Only one sticker is authorized on a vehicle at a time. If a motor
   vehicle has a tinted windshield, 51 SFS/S5P will not be responsible for damage to the tint
   during the application or removal of the decal. Any remaining DD Form 2220, Department
   of Defense Registered Vehicle, will be removed from the windshield.
   3.5.4. 51 SFS/S5P personnel will not affix a vehicle registration decal on a vehicle unless the
   vehicle meets vehicle registration requirements. Additionally, vehicles must have license
   plates permanently fixed to the front and rear of the vehicle. There are no exceptions to this
   policy as this requirement is also a requirement in the Korean Roads and Traffic Act.
   3.5.5. A DBIDS Motorcycle decal will also be issued for applicants registering bicycles
   equipped with an engine.

   be determined, the vehicle will be maintained in the SF Impound Lot for a minimum of 45
   days prior to the disposition. If the registered owner is known, the vehicle will be maintained
   for 120 days from the date the DD Form 2507 notice was issued. If there are no results in
   determining vehicle ownership, the vehicle will be disposed of IAW DOD 4160.21-M or
   coordinated with 51 FW/JA for turning the vehicle over to Pyeongtaek Motor vehicle
   Registration Office at no cost to the Government. License plates and vehicle registration

   registered. If not registered, diligent effort requires enough notice to the base populace to
   provide the owner an opportunity to come forward.

   51 SFS Investigations or OSI until the vehicle can be released to such authorities.
7.8. Search of Impounded Vehicles.
   7.8.1. Search of a motor vehicle in conjunction with impoundment based on criminal activity
   will likely occur in one of the following general situations:
       7.8.1.1. Owner or operator not present. This situation could arise during traffic and
       crime–related impoundments and abandoned vehicle seizures. A property search related
       to an investigation of criminal activity should not be conducted without search authority
32                                                               51FWI31-104 5 APRIL 2013


     unless the item to be seized is in plain view or is readily discernible on the outside as
     evidence of criminal activity. When in doubt, proper search authority should be obtained
     before searching.
     7.8.1.2. Owner or operator is present. This situation can occur during a traffic stop,
     criminal incident, if the operator is apprehended for a crime or serious traffic violation
     and sufficient probable cause exists to seize the vehicle, or intoxicated driving or traffic
     accidents in which the operator is present but incapacitated or otherwise unable to make
     adequate arrangements to safeguard the vehicle. If danger exists to the police or public or
     if there is risk of loss or destruction of evidence, an investigative type search of the
     vehicle may be conducted without search authority.
