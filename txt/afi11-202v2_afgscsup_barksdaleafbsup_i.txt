                UNIT STAN/EVAL FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION

3.1. Scope. For purposes of this instruction, "unit" includes levels of organization under HHQs
required to establish a Stan/Eval function. Most units are composed of an Operations Group
(OG) and flying squadrons/detachments (henceforth in this AFI, "squadron" will be used
synonymously with "detachment"). Where there is no parent OG, squadrons will assume duties
listed for OGs.
3.2. Operations Group. The conduct of the unit level Stan/Eval program is directed by the
OG/CC.
   3.2.1. OG/CC Responsibilities.
       3.2.1.1. Provide manpower to the unit Stan/Eval function to execute the duties directed
       by this AFI.
       3.2.1.2. Designate OG Stan/Eval (OGV) flight examiners (see paragraph 4.2.3).
       3.2.1.3. Provide the means to procure the necessary materials for mission planning, pre-
       flight briefings, and flying supervision.
       3.2.1.3. (AFGSC) Ensure adequate aircrew briefing facilities are provided at the unit
       level. Attachment 8 of this supplement contains guidance for the minimum mission
       planning materials required to conduct an adequate aircrew briefing.
       3.2.1.4. Provide a suitable Stan/Eval testing area.
       3.2.1.4. (AFGSC) A suitable Stan/Eval testing facility is one that provides a quiet,
       distraction-free atmosphere and allows easy monitoring of examinees by Stan/Eval
       personnel.
       3.2.1.5. Direct supplementary evaluations (see Chapter 9).
       3.2.1.6. Chair the SEB.
       3.2.1.7. Establish procedures to implement MAJCOM-mandated Stan/Eval software.
       3.2.1.8. (Added-BARKSDALE) The PEX system Go/No-Go and Stan/Eval functions
       will be fully utilized as the positive control system that ensures aircrew members have
       completed all ground training and Stan/Eval items required for evaluations and their
       associated requisites.
   3.2.2. OGV Functions.
       3.2.2.1. At the OGV level, emphasis is on overall unit standardization. Under direction
       of the Chief of OGV, flight examiners will ensure standardization among squadron
       Stan/Eval functions and squadron-assigned flight examiners.
       3.2.2.2. Establish procedures for review and quality control of AF Forms 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Qualification, and (if applicable) AF Forms 8a, Certificate of Aircrew
       Qualification (Multiple Aircraft).
14                  AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014


        3.2.2.2.1. (Added-BARKSDALE) Procedures for review and quality control of AF
        Forms 8/8a can be referenced in paragraph 7.3 of this document.
     3.2.2.3. Establish procedures to maintain and review unit Flight Evaluation Folders
     (FEFs). If not maintained by the squadron Stan/Eval function, maintain unit FEFs.
     3.2.2.4. Establish procedures for requisite Aircrew Exams (see Chapter 6).
     3.2.2.5. Establish and maintain a trend program.
     3.2.2.5. (AFGSC) The trend program should track discrepancies and missed
     examination questions to compile data for trend analysis. As a minimum unit trend
     programs should contain a minimum sample size and threshold for determining a trend.
     For example, a deficiency meets the threshold of a trend when: 1) a question missed 20%
     of the time with a sample size greater than 5 attempts; 2) an evaluation area/sub area
     downgraded on 20% of administered evaluations; or 3) a requisite examination question
     missed more than twice during a semiannual period with a sample size less than five.
     Meeting trend threshold alone is not the sole means of designating a deficiency as a trend.
     3.2.2.5. (BARKSDALE) OGV Staff trends monitor will:
        3.2.2.5.1. Scope will include trend analysis of all evaluations.
        3.2.2.5.1. (BARKSDALE) Develop and maintain trends report formats for squadron
        trends monitors.
        3.2.2.5.2. For units with more than one type of MDS and/or crew positions, combine
        discrepancies common to all MDSs/crew positions to determine trends (e.g.,
        instrument procedures).
        3.2.2.5.2. (BARKSDALE) Correlate squadron trend reports to group level.
        3.2.2.5.3. For Formal Training Units (FTUs) and Combat Crew Training Squadrons
        (CCTSs), maintain separate trend data for students and instructors.

           3.3.3.2. The chief of squadron Stan/Eval will report directly to and be rated by the
           squadron commander, or as specified by MAJCOM supplement.
           3.3.3.3. Further manning will be as directed by the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
              3.3.3.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) For FTU squadrons, the OG/CC may authorize as many
              additional duty flight evaluators as required to accommodate student syllabus
              evaluation requirements. FTU additional duty flight evaluators should primarily
              evaluate students.
              3.3.3.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) The OG/CC will determine squadron flight examiner
              manning according to mission requirements. As a guide use Table 3.2. Ratios. Include

  4.3.3. Administer evaluations only within their weapon system/aircrew specialty and only
  evaluate those mission/skill sets in which they maintain qualification and/or certification.
  EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations and where specifically authorized in AFI11-2MDS, Vol 2.
     4.3.3.1. Waiver authority for flight examiners to evaluate mission/skill sets in which they
     are not certified is the OG/CC. For senior flight examiners (see paragraph 4.4), waiver
     authority is the next commander in their flying chain of command
  4.3.4. Will not administer evaluations outside of their MAJCOM unless specifically
  requested by the MAJCOM Stan/Eval organization of the examinee and approved by the
  MAJCOM Stan/Eval organization of the examiner. MAJCOMs may establish procedures in
  their supplement for flight examiners to administer evaluations outside of NAFs/units within
  their own MAJCOM (see also paragraph 2.3.5).
  4.3.4. (AFGSC) Requesting and approval authority is HQ AFGSC/A3TV. For collocated
  Air Reserve Component (ARC) units, or instances where individuals from one MAJCOM
  have permanent positions established on another MAJCOM’s base, a one-time agreement
  between both OG/CCs, coordinated with each MAJCOM/Stan-Eval, will suffice. For
  associated units, cross-component evaluations are approved and will be coordinated between
  the host unit and the associated unit at the OGV or group commander level or IAW their
  MOU.
     4.3.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) Cross-command agreements are authorized by MOUs
     between unit OG/CC’s and coordinated with each MAJCOM/Stan-Eval. For associate
     units, cross-component evaluations are approved. (Exception: Any evaluation
     administered by HHQ evaluators).
  4.3.5. Conduct a thorough pre-mission briefing and post-mission debriefing for the examinee
  and applicable aircrew members on all aspects of the evaluation.
  4.3.5. (AFGSC) The pre-mission brief includes a review of the evaluation grade sheet
  explaining the required areas for the evaluation, a discussion of specific crew
  duties/responsibilities and a review of the critical sub areas. For evaluations associated with
  upgrades, complete the following prior to flight: review training folder for completeness,
  ensure all syllabus requirements are met. The flight examiner will debrief the examinee on
  all aspects of the evaluation and ensure the examinee understands the overall grade, remarks,
  and recommendations entered on the AF Form 8.
  4.3.6. Immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline during an evaluation
  (applies to both the examinee as well as any accompanying aircrew).
  4.3.6. (AFGSC) If the flight examiner deems the aircraft commander incompetent or
  otherwise incapacitated and safe flight is jeopardized, she/he will assume command , or if
  (s)he is not at a set of controls, designate another fully qualified aircraft commander as in
  command. Advise the aircraft commander and crew. During any evaluation, flight
  examiners witnessing significant deviations and/or unsafe airmanship in crew positions in
  which they are not qualified will report the incident(s) to the unit commander and OGV. If
  the commander determines the deviation(s) warrant a downgrade or an overall Qualification
  Level 3, document the deviation(s) on an AF Form 8 IAW AFI 11-202V2, paragraph 7.4.
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                           25


   4.3.7. As soon as possible, notify the examinee’s squadron commander (or available
   supervision if the squadron commander cannot be reached) whenever Qualification Level 2
   or 3 (Q2 or Q3) performance is observed (see paragraph 5.3.3).
   4.3.7. (AFGSC) This debrief may be conducted over the telephone.
   4.3.7. (BARKSDALE) Notify the Chief of OGV NLT delivery of the Temporary Form 8 to
   OGV
   4.3.8. (Added-AFGSC) Flight examiners should not evaluate personnel they have primarily
   instructed or recommended for upgrade.
   4.3.9. (Added-AFGSC) Flight examiners will establish and maintain an account on the
   AFGSC Stan/Eval CoP. The account will be enabled to automatically notify the user of
   changes to FCIF information, FCIF index of publications, and any other critical information.
4.4. Senior Flight Examiner Program.
   4.4.1. Flying NAF/CCs and OG/CCs may maintain flight examiner status in their primary
   assigned aircraft.
       4.4.1.1. NAF/CVs and OG/CDs may perform this function if the principal incumbent is
       not qualified or available.
       4.4.1.2. OG/CDs that fly different MDSs from the OG/CC in multi-MDS wings, or
       occupy a different crew position in the same MDS, may be designated as senior flight
       examiners at the OG/CC’s discretion.
       4.4.1.3. Document designations IAW paragraph 4.2.3.2.
   4.4.2. Individuals eligible for Senior flight examiner status do not require, nor do they have
   to maintain, instructor qualification, but they must have completed flight examiner
   certification IAW unit standards.
       4.4.2.1. (Added-BARKSDALE) As a minimum, OGV will brief the senior examiner on
       2 OGV policies and programs. Additional upgrade training will be based on the senior
       examiner's experience and needs.
4.5. (Added-BARKSDALE) SEFE/SELO Training. Mandatory training for all OGV
assigned SEFEs and SELOs will consist of three parts. Part one consists of an introductory
outline of Stan/Eval functions, Chief of OGV expectations, and AFI/local guidance. Part two
focuses on the execution of Stan/Eval programs tailored to the individual based on duties
assigned in the Additional Duties Roster. Part three is hands-on training with the PEX system to
become familiar with Stan/Eval procedures and processes.

                      AIRCREW QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes aircrew qualification evaluations to
ensure qualification of aircrew members and supplementary evaluations to ensure
standardization of operations.
5.1. (AFGSC)General. Flight examiners should not evaluate their rater. Higher echelon flight
examiners will administer evaluations to lower echelon flight examiners. HHQ flight examiners
will administer all OGV evaluations to the maximum extent possible. Exceptions to this policy
require HHQ Stan/Eval approval. See Table 7.1. for detailed breakdown of evaluation execution
guidance and subsequent AF Form 8 completion. Do not change an evaluation into a training
flight after the evaluation has begun. This does not preclude accomplishing training after the
evaluation is complete.
   5.1.1. To promote efficient use of flying resources, accomplish aircrew qualification
   evaluations concurrently, whenever practical.
   5.1.2. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM supplements.
   For specialized aircrew, see Chapter 8. For guidance on supplementary evaluations, see
   Chapter 9.
   5.1.2. (AFGSC) IAW AFI 11-2MDSV2.
5.2. Categories. Aircrew qualification evaluations are divided into five categories
(Qualification (QUAL), Instrument (INSTM), Mission (MSN), Instructor (INSTR), and SPOT)
each consisting of two structured phases, ground and flight. (EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations
may consist of either a ground or flight phase.) Each phase requires the completion of requisite
tasks (see paragraph 5.5). (EXCEPTION: a SPOT evaluation has no requisite tasks.)
   5.2.1. QUAL Evaluations.
       5.2.1.1. Purpose. Ensure basic qualification in an MDS and/or crew position.
       5.2.1.2. Execution. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in their
       primary assigned aircraft/crew position as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol
       2. QUAL evaluations may be combined with INSTM and/or MSN evaluations IAW AFI
       11-2MDS, Vol 2. See Chapter 8 for specialized aircrew.
   5.2.2. INSTM Evaluations.
       5.2.2.1. Purpose. Obtain/maintain instrument qualification in order to operate under
       Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
       5.2.2.2. Execution. All USAF pilots (and other pilots flying operationally with the
       USAF, e.g., exchange pilots) will obtain/maintain instrument qualification by
       successfully completing a periodic INSTM evaluation.
       5.2.2.2. (AFGSC) Aircrew members with multiple qualifications will accomplish the
       instrument evaluation in their primary aircraft.
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                            27


        5.2.2.2.1. EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI
        11-401, Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft
        pilots; T-41/51/52 pilots.
        5.2.2.2.2. Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may also be assigned to other
        aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument qualification, but will take their
        INSTM checkride in the non-excepted aircraft.
        5.2.2.2.3. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification will not fly
        under IFR except under supervised status in a training program leading to
        requalification. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed above.)
  5.2.3. MSN Evaluations.
     5.2.3.1. Purpose. To ensure qualification to employ the aircrew’s assigned weapon
     system/crew position in the accomplishment of the unit’s operational or Designated
     Operational Capability (DOC) statements mission(s).
     5.2.3.2. Execution. All aircrew members maintaining Mission Ready (MR)/Combat
     Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status (IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
     Aircrew Training) will complete a periodic MSN evaluation as specified in the applicable
     AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.1. EXCEPTION: The requirement for a MSN evaluation may be waived for
        those aircraft where performance of normal operational, test, and training sorties
        involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM and/or QUAL
        evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Document waiver via memorandum
        for record (MFR) to be included in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2. HQ
        USAF/A3O-A approval is not required for such waivers. Specify approval
        procedures in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction or in the applicable AFI 11-
        2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.2. The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required
        in fulfillment of the aircraft’s operational or DOC statement missions.
        5.2.3.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) Evaluate BMC aircrew members on their ability to fly
        missions routinely performed by the examinee.
  5.2.4. INSTR Evaluations.
     5.2.4.1. Purpose. To qualify aircrew as instructors in their weapon system/crew position
     by focusing primarily on the examinees instructional ability.
     5.2.4.1. (AFGSC) Flight examiners should focus on examinee instructional ability
     during initial instructor evalutions. This does not preclude updating a required periodic
     evaluation if all required flight phase requirements are completed during the instructor
     flight evaluation and the examinee subsequently completes all ground phase requirements
     for the evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2, paragraph 5.5.3. Label the evaluation
     appropriately (EXAMPLE: "INIT INSTR/MSN").
     5.2.4.2. Execution. Aircrew members obtaining/regaining instructor qualification in a
     weapon system/crew position must complete evaluations of instructional capability in
     that weapon system/crew position. Guidance for specialized, universal, and/or multiple
28                  AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014


     qualified aircrew will be specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or AFI 11-2MDS Vol
     2. EXCEPTION: For units undergoing aircraft conversion, when a complement of
     current and qualified Air Force instructors does not exist to accomplish initial unit
     instructor qualification, with MAJCOM/A3 approval and Lead MAJCOM/A3
     coordination the OG/CC may establish an Initial cadre (minimum required for initial
     conversion) of flight instructors who do not require an INIT INSTR evaluation. Initial
     cadre must be current and qualified instructors in a US Air Force aircraft who will remain
     in the same crew position on the new aircraft. OG/CCs will notify MAJCOMs and
     provide initial cadre list for each crew position with current qualification and total flight
     and instructor hours. OG/CCs will use discretion when establishing initial cadre
     instructors and consider availability of suitable instructor courses. See also paragraph
     5.13.
        5.2.4.2.1. Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions
        whenever possible. When students are not available or mission/crew composition
        requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator will
        serve as the student.
        5.2.4.2.1. (BARKSDALE) Initial instructor evaluations will normally be conducted
        by a SQ/CC or DO of like specialty. If the squadron is unable to accomplish the
        evaluation, OGV or an appropriate evaluator may accomplish the evaluation.
        5.2.4.2.2. Evaluations of instructor qualification will be conducted during all
        subsequent periodic evaluations.
        5.2.4.2.3. Instructors who expire on their INSTM, QUAL, and/or MSN checkrides
        evaluations are not qualified to instruct in those areas (e.g. if an IP expires on his/her
        MSN zone, he/she may still instruct in INSTM/QUAL-related areas as specified in
        AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2).
  5.2.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional).
     5.2.5.1. Purpose. Evaluate a specific event or requirement without intending to satisfy
     the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an initial INSTR evaluation.
     5.2.5.2. Execution. A SPOT has no specific requisites, unless specified in MAJCOM
     supplements, but may be No Notice IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.
        5.2.5.2.1. An examinee may utilize a SPOT evaluation to update a
        QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
        evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.8 (document on
        the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.1. OG/CCs may authorize additional flights in order to help the aircrew
            accomplish periodic requirements (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph
            7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.2. When the flight examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not
            qualified in the MDS (e.g. a Senior flight examiner), the evaluation will not be
            credited towards a periodic evaluation.
     5.2.5.3. Any qualifying event and/or evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through
     5.2.4 will be documented as a SPOT evaluation.
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                             29


         5.2.5.3.1. (Added-BARKSDALE) Crewmembers receiving a no-notice flight
         evaluation in their eligibility period will use the evaluation toward updating their
         expiration date or a ground requisite (i.e. EPE or T-4). Crewmembers will
         accomplish all scheduled activity, if conditions permit.          Requirements not
         accomplished on a no-notice flight evaluation will be scheduled on a subsequent
         flight.
         5.2.5.3.2. (Added-BARKSDALE) “Normal preparation” starts at 0800 on mission
         planning (MP) day for MP-Fly and show time for Instant Thunder/Show-N-Go
         sorties. Any notification occurring at or after these times until take-off will constitute
         a no-notice evaluation.
     5.2.5.4. (Added-AFGSC) Flight Examiner Objectivity Evaluations. An evaluation
     of the objectivity and skill of a lower echelon flight examiner in administering a
     flight/EP/ATD evaluation. Use SPOT as the type of evaluation under the Ground or
     Flight Phase, then explain in the mission description that the evaluation was a Flight
     Examiner Objectivity Evaluation. Overall rating for this type of an evaluation will be
     either qualified (1) or unqualified (3).
         5.2.5.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) Use the grading criteria in Attachment 9.
         5.2.5.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) A qualified rating (1) indicates that the flight examiner
         objectivity examinee complied with HHQ and local Stan/Eval directives, properly
         briefed and debriefed the examinee, correctly identified discrepancies, awarded the
         correct grade for each evaluated area, awarded the appropriate overall grade and, if
         required, assigned appropriate additional training.
         5.2.5.4.3. (Added-AFGSC) An unqualified rating (3) will be awarded when the
         flight examiner failed to satisfy the requirements of a qualification rating (1). The
         certification of the flight examiner receiving an unqualified rating will be determined
         by the SQ/CC or OG/CC as applicable.
  5.2.6. Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe
  the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through 5.2.5:
     5.2.6.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type, to include instructor
     qualification, in a specific weapon system/crew position (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT
     MSN, INIT INSTR).
     5.2.6.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
     qualification due to:
         5.2.6.2.1. Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The recheck will be IAW the
         guidance for that periodic evaluation.
         5.2.6.2.2. Loss of currency that requires a requal evaluation (IAW AFI11-2MDS Vol
         1). In this case RQ SPOT will be used for documentation (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2).
         The recheck profile will be as directed by the SQ/CC and will include, as a minimum,
         those items for which the individual is non-current.
         5.2.6.2.3. A flight recheck following a failed periodic evaluation. The recheck will be
         IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.6.1.
 30                  AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014


          5.2.6.2.4. Loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
          paragraph 5.9). The recheck profile will be as directed by the commander on the AF
          Form 8/8a (see paragraph 7.4).
          5.2.6.2.5. The RQ prefix will not be used under the following circumstances:
             5.2.6.2.5.1. If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to
             complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.5.1), but the
             flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period and
             the OG/CC determines that qualification will be re-established by completion of
             the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight evaluation.
             5.2.6.2.5.2. To prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
             qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
      5.2.6.3. No-Notice (N/N).
          5.2.6.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
          daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
          5.2.6.3.2. A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the
          evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. “Normal
          preparation” will be as defined in the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
      5.2.6.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
      in a simulator and/or suitable ATD as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
      5.2.6.4. (AFGSC) Do not use simulators for the flight phase of the evaluation unless the
      evaluated phases/events are coded SIMCERT 1 or are identified in AFI 11-2MDSV1 or
      V2.
      5.2.6.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
      (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
      evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes (if not obvious by the context of the
      evaluation) will be explained on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.
5.3. Grading System.
   5.3.1. A two step grading system is used to evaluate and document aircrew performance.
      5.3.1.1. In the first step, individual grades are assigned to each evaluation requisite to
      include the grading of areas/subareas of aircrew performance against established
      evaluation criteria (see paragraph 5.4). Performance less than fully qualified must be
      documented.
      5.3.1.2. In the second step, an overall qualification level is assigned based on a
      compilation of all individual requisite grades (see paragraph 5.3.3.4).
   5.3.2. Performance Areas/Subareas.
      5.3.2.1. Areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) grading system.
      Discrepancies will be documented against the established areas/subareas.
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                         31


        5.3.2.1.1. Q indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of
        all required information and performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
        tolerances.
        5.3.2.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
        tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight
        examiner. Deviations must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances, jeopardize flight
        safety, or be a breach of flight discipline.
        5.3.2.1.3. U indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters thereby
        compromising flight safety, that deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances
        adversely affected mission accomplishment, and/or evaluated performance
        constituted a breach of flight discipline. An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade
        of U requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the flight
        examiner.
     5.3.2.2. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or U require remedial action that includes
     either debriefing discrepancies and/or assignment of additional training.
     5.3.2.2. (AFGSC) Do not accomplish additional training to clear a sub area graded Q-/U
     on the same flight as the evaluation.
        5.3.2.2.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of
        the evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides instruction concerning the
        discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
        proficiency.
        5.3.2.2.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by the flight examiner to
        remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
        5.3.2.2.2. (AFGSC) Additional Training. Units will outline procedures for
        ensuring additional training is accomplished in the unit supplement to this volume.
            5.3.2.2.2.1. May include self-study, ground instruction, use of a simulator/ATD
            or flying.
            5.3.2.2.2.2. Will be complete by the last day of the third month following the date
            of the discrepancy (e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 12, additional training must
            be accomplished by 30 Apr 12).
            5.3.2.2.2.3. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for completion of
            additional training, the SQ/CC will review the situation and direct appropriate
            action. Document the circumstances with an MFR to be included in the AF Form
            8/8a (see paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
            5.3.2.2.2.4. Document additional training on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs
            7.3.5.6 and 7.3.7.3.4.
            5.3.2.2.2.5. (Added-BARKSDALE) The administering Flight Examiner will
            deliver a copy of the completed Temporary Form 8 to OGV NLT the next duty
            day following the evaluation (this includes the debrief). This Temporary Form 8
            copy will include any restrictions, the assigned additional training and the
            required completion dates.
32                   AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014


             5.3.2.2.2.6. (Added-BARKSDALE) OGV will enter the Temporary Form 8 into
             PEX and add the additional training and restrictions. OGV will notify the SQ/DO
             and training flight of the required additional training and assigned restrictions.
             5.3.2.2.2.7. (Added-BARKSDALE) Squadron training flight will document any
             additional training assigned on a Training Accomplishment Report (TAR) in the
             individual's training folder. Attached personnel should complete additional
             training with their attached flying squadron.
             5.3.2.2.2.8. (Added-BARKSDALE) Squadron training flight will notify OGV
             when the additional training is complete. OGV will update PEX with the
             additional training status, supervised status or restrictions as required.
     5.3.2.3. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as “required” in the
     general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
         5.3.2.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Alternate Means of Evaluation. When a required area
         is verbally evaluated, the flight examiner will explain why the area could not be
         accomplished in flight in the comments on the AF Form 8. No comments are
         necessary if an optional area is not accomplished in flight.
     5.3.2.4. In addition to required areas/subareas, the flight examiner will grade any
     area/subarea observed during an evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts
     the specific evaluation accomplished or overall flight safety.
     5.3.2.5. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions.
     5.3.2.6. Minor momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies
     prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider
     cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
     5.3.2.7. The flight examiner may further identify any area/sub-area as “Commendable”
     if, in the examiner’s determination, the aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional
     skill and knowledge. Document IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.2.
  5.3.3. Qualification Levels. Qualification levels are assigned both to individual evaluations
  (i.e. flight evals and EPEs) as well as overall performance. Individual evaluations are graded
  as a compilation of all area/sub-area grades. Overall performance is graded as a compilation
  of all requisite tasks associated with the required evaluation. Both individual and overall
  grades are based on the following.
     5.3.3.1. Q1. The aircrew member demonstrated desired performance and knowledge of
     procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the grading criteria.
     This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted, but may be awarded when
     discrepancies are noted if:
         5.3.3.1.1. No U grades were awarded for any discrepancy area/sub-area.
         5.3.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
         awarding of an overall Q1.
         5.3.3.1.3. All areas/sub-areas graded as Q- during the evaluation were cleared during
         the debrief of that evaluation.
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                         33


     5.3.3.2. Q2. The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to perform duties safely, but:
        5.3.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
        assigned.
        5.3.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
        5.3.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q2 may be given if there is
        justification based on Q- performance in one or several areas/subareas.
        5.3.3.2.4. (Added-AFGSC) Aircrew receiving a Q-2 will continue to fly as a
        qualified crewmember while satisfying any additional training requirements, but will
        not accomplish any events graded “U” without instructor supervision until assigned
        additional training for those events is complete.
        5.3.3.2.5. (Added-AFGSC) If the Q-2 was assigned for an evaluation completing an
        upgrade, the examinee will not fly in the new qualification until assigned additional
        training is complete.
        5.3.3.2.6. (Added-AFGSC) An instructor or flight examiner graded Q-2 on any
        evaluation will not perform instructor or examiner duties until additional training is
        successfully accomplished. Mark the restriction block and document this restriction
        in the comments section on the AF Form 8. Refer to paragraph 7.3.5.7.2 for
        procedures to lift this type of restriction.
     5.3.3.3. Q3. The aircrew member demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety,
     performance or knowledge.
        5.3.3.3.1. Any critical area graded U requires an overall Q3 (applicable to both flight
        evaluations and EPEs).
        5.3.3.3.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q3 may be given if there is
        justification based on Q-/U performance in one or several non-critical areas/subareas.
     5.3.3.4. Assigning the overall qualification level.
        5.3.3.4.1. The flight-phase flight examiner is the examiner responsible for assigning
        the overall qualification level.
        5.3.3.4.2. An overall grade of Q1 or Q2 will be given only after all evaluation
        requirements (to include requisite examinations) have been completed and given due
        consideration.
        5.3.3.4.3. An overall grade of Q3 may be awarded at any time.
        5.3.3.4.4. While AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may dictate the highest grade for a flight or
        EPE based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will
        always be the determining factor in deciding the overall grade.
     5.3.3.5. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation. An EQ may be given, but will
     only be applied to the overall grade - not to separate requisites. Document on the AF
     Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.2. An EQ may be given when:
        5.3.3.5.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
        all phases of the evaluation;
 34                   AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014


          5.3.3.5.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
          5.3.3.5.3. The aircrew member received a Q on all areas/subareas evaluated.
5.4. Evaluation Criteria.
   5.4.1. Lead MAJCOMs, in coordination with the applicable user MAJCOMs, will establish
   and maintain standardized INSTM, MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluation criteria in the
   appropriate AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Lead MAJCOMs will coordinate with the program
   managers of any command-mandated software on any updates of eval criteria to aid in the
   expeditious revision of eval criteria files. Lead MAJCOMs are also responsible for
   coordinating the establishment of the following:
       5.4.1.1. Areas/subareas including the identification of critical areas and those areas
       required for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged into general
       and specific evaluation areas.
          5.4.1.1.1. Critical areas are those areas that, upon failure, would most adversely
          affect the qualification of an aircrew member. Critical areas will include, but are not
          limited to, Airmanship, Safety, and Flight Discipline.
       5.4.1.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Checks. This is required for QUAL
       evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
          5.4.1.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for maintaining required flight
          publications as outlined in applicable AFI11-2MDS volumes.
          5.4.1.2.2. Q performance requires individual flight publications be current and
          properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
          members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
          required for the mission.
       5.4.1.3. An area containing criteria for Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM)
       IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, and
       MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
       5.4.1.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
       and procedures or applicable Host Nation requirements for evaluations administered
       outside of the NAS.
5.5. Requisites. These include both ground and flight phase items. The ground phase, when
required, includes a series of examinations (see Chapter 6) as well as evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment (i.e. EPEs, see paragraph
5.5.1.2). The flight phase includes an in-flight and/or simulator evaluation of aircrew
performance.
   5.5.1. Ground Phase Requisites.
       5.5.1.1. Ground phase requisites for each evaluation include the following.
          5.5.1.1.1. QUAL: Open book examination, closed book examination,
          Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
          5.5.1.1.2. INSTM: Instrument examination
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                             35


         5.5.1.1.3. MSN: As specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     5.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPEs).
         5.5.1.2.1. Purpose. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs
         and systems for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate mission-specific EPs and tactical
         systems knowledge during MSN evaluations.
         5.5.1.2.2. Execution. AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 will specify contents of EPEs, areas to be
         evaluated, grading criteria, and whether EPEs may be done in-flight, in a
         simulator/ATD, or verbally.
            5.5.1.2.2.1. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for each combined
            evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation).
            5.5.1.2.2.2. A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
            INSTM/QUAL eval) as long as the combined EPE is of a scope and duration to
            cover required areas and is conducted within the requisite zone for each
            evaluation (see paragraph 5.8).
         5.5.1.2.3. Grading. Q1 performance for EPEs requires taking the proper action in
         the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is responsible
         for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
         5.5.1.2.4. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight
         examiner will indicate if the additional training must be accomplished before the next
         unsupervised flight (see also paragraph 5.3.2.2.2). Document IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.6
         and 7.3.7.3.4.
         5.5.1.2.5. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP
         situation during an EPE requires an EPE grade of 3 (unqualified). Under these
         circumstances, the examinee will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
         accomplished (either written, verbally, or in a simulator/ATD as determined by the
         flight examiner)
         5.5.1.2.6. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an EPE grade of 3
         (unqualified) will be placed on supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7.
         5.5.1.2.7. (Added-AFGSC) Record EPE discrepancies on the AF Form 4068,
         AFGSC Form 8A or MAJCOM-approved alternative. Keep them on file until the AF
         Form 8 is completed.
  5.5.2. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
  in the weapon system and/or a suitable simulator/ATD (unless restricted by AFI 11-2MDS
  Vol 2).
     5.5.2.1. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
     appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2, and allow accurate
     measure of the proficiency of the examinee.
     5.5.2.2. Evaluation profiles will be realistic, reflect unit tasking, be consistent with daily
     training missions, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the unit mission.
  5.5.3. Requisite Completion.
 36                   AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014


       5.5.3.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the eligibility period of the
       current evaluation (see paragraph 5.8). The OG/CCmay waive this requirement on a
       case-by-case basis (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
       5.5.3.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations accomplished outside
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period
       beginning with the month in which the first ground requisite or flight evaluation was
       administered, whichever occurs first. EXCEPTION: For extended evaluations (IAW
       paragraph 5.8.3.2), requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
       eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
       5.5.3.3. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of combined
       evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
       5.5.3.4. Requisites from a completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations
       provided they cover all required areas and are within the requisite zone for each
       evaluation.
       5.5.3.5. For aircrew possessing instrument qualifications in multiple aircraft, one
       instrument exam may count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs
       within the zone for each evaluation IAW the paragraphs above.
5.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
   5.6.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or ground
   recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first failure,
   (e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 12, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 12).
       5.6.1.1. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the three-month time limit on a case-by-case
       basis.
          5.6.1.1.1. Document the waiver(s) with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8/8a
          IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
       5.6.1.2. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed during this
       period, based on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and hours of
       training required.
       5.6.1.3. The flight examiner that administered the original check will not normally
       administer the recheck.
       5.6.1.4. A recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q or
       Q-/debriefed criteria for each area graded U.
       5.6.1.5. Ground rechecks may be directed when the flight examiner deems a flight
       recheck unnecessary, but are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of a Q3
       evaluation (document IAW paragraph 7.3.9.2).
       5.6.1.6. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.5.3.1or 5.5.3.2
       remain valid, IAW the paragraphs above.
   5.6.2. Status Downgrade. Aircrew members receiving a Q3 INSTM, QUAL and/or MSN
   evaluation are non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR)/non-basic
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                           37


   mission capable(N-BMC)/non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
   For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC) need not be downgraded if
   the discrepancies were only in instructor areas/subareas.
      5.6.2.1. (Added-BARKSDALE) OGV will enter the Temporary Form 8 into PEX and
      add the additional training, supervised status and restrictions as assigned/required NLT
      than COB the next duty day following receipt of the completed Temporary Form 8. This
      will flag the member under Stan/Eval for Go/No-Go with appropriate status.
   5.6.3. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
   judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
   successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
      5.6.3.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
      requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
          5.6.3.1.1. QUAL Evaluation: Place the examinee on supervised status (see
          paragraph 5.7) in the aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the
          opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For
          specialized, universal, and/or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining qualification for
          similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may direct supervised status in
          all aircraft in which the individual maintains qualification.
          5.6.3.1.2. INSTM Evaluation: Restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
          examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
          5.6.3.1.3. MSN       Evaluation:     The      examinee      may      perform    basic
          qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
          supervised status for mission tasks.
          5.6.3.1.4. INSTR Evaluation (or any evaluation where instructor qualifications are
          being evaluated): Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any instructor
          area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is completed.
      5.6.3.2. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q3 on any evaluation until a successful recheck is
      completed (see paragraph 5.6.1).
      5.6.3.3. If defined in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1 and/or Vol 2, formal schoolhouses will include
      restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a for any core item not accomplished due to training
      limitations, regardless if the method of qualification is by evaluation or instructor
      certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform core items in which they are
      not qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. In this case, MDS-
      specific guidance will set the time requirement for completion of additional training.
      5.6.3.4. Document restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.1.
5.7. Supervised Status.
   5.7.1. If unsatisfactory performance or restrictions require an examinee be placed on
   supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be
   determined by the SQ/CC and/or as specified in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1.
   5.7.2. Supervision will only be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors.
 38                  AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014


      5.7.2.1. (Added-BARKSDALE) The SQ/DO or training flight will notify OGV when
      any member is placed in supervised status along with identified individuals, besides
      instructors, who are designated to accomplish the supervision. Upon notification OGV
      will enter the supervised status into PEX with amplifying remarks as required.
5.8. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
   5.8.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th
   month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a periodic
   evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 10 expires on 31 Mar 12.).
      5.8.1.1. (Added-BARKSDALE) An Expired Evaluation MFR will be used to document
      individuals who do not finish their requisites within the eligibility period (document IAW
      paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.). OGV will immediately notify the SQ/CC for appropriate action.
   5.8.2. Eligibility Period. Periodic evaluations will be scheduled in the eligibility period,
   defined as the six-month period prior to the expiration date.
   5.8.2. (BARKSDALE) Eligibility Period. Squadron Branch Chiefs or Flight Commanders
   will coordinate with scheduling/flight commanders to schedule evaluations; however, the
   individual is ultimately responsible for ensuring completion of all evaluation requirements.
   Attempt to schedule in-flight evaluations NLT the end of the third month of eligibility.
      5.8.2.1. (Added-BARKSDALE) OGV will notify individuals when entering their
      eligibility period via a traceable method (i.e. E-mail, MFR, PEX).
      5.8.2.2. (Added-BARKSDALE) Individuals should complete ground requisites within
      the first 2 months of eligibility. The SQ/DO will be notified of requisite delinquency at
      start of the third month of eligibility and is responsible for scheduling testing during the
      fourth month of the eligibility. 6.4. OGV is the OPR for the Unit Testing Program. OGV
      will develop and maintain question banks, the requisite open and closed book
      examinations, periodic examinations, instrument examinations, and flight surgeon
      examinations.
   5.8.3. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. On a case-by-case basis, periodic evaluations may be
   scheduled before or after the eligibility period according to the following criteria:
      5.8.3.1. Evaluations Conducted Prior to the Eligibility Period. SQ/CCs may
      authorize individuals to complete periodic evaluations prior to the eligibility period
      (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
      5.8.3.2. Extended Evaluations.
          5.8.3.2.1. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize blanket
          or group extensions on an as-required basis. Requests for extensions at MAJCOM or
          subordinate levels will be submitted IAW paragraph 1.3.2.
          5.8.3.2.2. MAJCOM-Extended           Evaluations. MAJCOM/A3s       may     extend
          evaluation expiration dates for individual aircrew members on a case-by-case basis
          IAW paragraph 1.3.1. Provide guidance for MAJCOM extensions in MAJCOM
          supplements to this instruction.
          5.8.3.2.3. SQ/CC-Extended Evaluations. SQ/CCs may extend the expiration date
          of periodic evaluations up to three months for the reasons listed below (document
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                               39


           IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2). Extensions will be on a case-by-case basis and this
           paragraph is not authority to grant blanket extensions. For individual extensions
           longer than three months, see paragraph 5.8.3.2.2. For group or blanket extensions,
           see paragraph 5.8.3.2.1. Requisites not completed during the original eligibility
           period must be completed prior to the extended expiration date.
              5.8.3.2.3.1. PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
              5.8.3.2.3.2. Departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft type.
              5.8.3.2.3.3. Undergoing unit aircraft conversion, as directed by MAJCOM.
              5.8.3.2.3.4. Removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or retirement).
              5.8.3.2.3.5. Participation in real world operations (to include operations other
              than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required flight evaluation(s)
              before or during deployment.
              5.8.3.2.3.5. (AFGSC) This also includes unavailability of aircraft/assets due to
              deployments in support of real-world operations.
       5.8.3.3. Non-Standard Approval Authority
           5.8.3.3.1. For SQ/CCs and above (e.g. OG/CCs, WG/CCs, etc.), the approval
           authority is the next commander in the examinee’s flying chain of command.
           5.8.3.3.2. In all other cases, if the flying chain of command differs from
           administrative chain of command (e.g. HHQ attached flyers), approvals will be by the
           attached unit/CC with the concurrence of the examinee’s immediate administrative
           supervisor.
           5.8.3.3.3. For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval
           authority.
   5.8.4. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
   member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
   eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.2) or within the
   period for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.3), the aircrew
   member loses the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph
   5.6.3 apply.
       5.8.4.1. Qualification may be re-established by accomplishing a complete requalification
       evaluation (to include requisites) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation.
       5.8.4.2. OG/CCs may waive the re-accomplishment of completed requisites on a case-
       by-case basis (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
5.9. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander (squadron or above) may direct a
downgrade (Q-/U) in a specific area/sub-area without unqualifying an individual. Additionally, a
commander may direct a downgrade that either removes a qualification (e.g. IP to MP) or
completely unqualifies an individual (e.g. MP to UP). Downgrades may be directed without
administering an evaluation using the following guidance:
 40                   AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014


   5.9.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only (e.g., breach of flying discipline, flight
   safety, etc.). Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an examiner, but may be
   recommended by an examiner from any MDS/aircrew specialty.
   5.9.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
   administrative or judicial actions (e.g. Letter of Counseling, Article 15, etc.). (Consult with
   the supporting SJA office for legal advice in these cases.) Use in cases where such incidences
   directly affect the commander’s confidence in the aircrew member’s ability to safely operate
   the aircraft and/or equipment (e.g. lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the
   aircrew’s decision-making abilities in the aircraft).
   5.9.3. For downgrades that either remove qualifications or completely unqualify an
   individual, the affected aircrew will cease acting in the qualification(s) from which they have
   been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade.
   5.9.4. Commander Directed Downgrades will be documented IAW paragraph 7.4.
5.10. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members who
maintain qualification in two or more MDS aircraft. For Universal Qualification see paragraph
5.11.
   5.10.1. When differences between aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead
   MAJCOM, in coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate
   qualification requirements.
   5.10.2. When separate qualifications are not required, document certification in different
   MDS series using AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. In lieu of the AF Form
   4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized
   official.
   5.10.3. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
   including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   See AFI 11-202, Vol 1.
   5.10.4. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
   include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified by
   the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are directed by
   the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
   5.10.5. QUAL and MSN Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL evaluation, and, if
   applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each MDS aircraft they maintain
   qualification according to applicable AFI MDS Vol 2, or AFI 16-1202 Vol 2.
   5.10.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q3 on an INSTM evaluation results in a
   downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A downgrade
   resulting from a Q3 in a QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft for which the
   evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is
   applicable to additional aircraft.
5.11. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized aircrew
who maintain qualification in two or more MDS where qualification is attained/maintained via a
minimum of a ground phase examination. A flight phase evaluation, when required, may be
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                           41


accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either gaining or maintaining
qualification.
   5.11.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualifications IAW
   Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified crewmember
   eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
   5.11.1. (AFGSC) IAW AFI 11-202V2 Chapter 8.
   5.11.2. Documentation. See Chapter 7 or Chapter 8, as applicable.
   5.11.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications maintained
   under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A MSN
   evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 and/or MAJCOM supplement
   to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will include a flight phase evaluation in
   one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member maintains qualification.
   5.11.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally qualified
   aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in loss of
   applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI MDS Vol 2.
5.12. Aircrew Flying in Non-USAF Aircraft and with Non-USAF Units. Aircrew members
authorized to perform duties in non-USAF aircraft IAW AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached
to non-USAF units for flying, abide by host service or host country guidance, except for the
requirement to maintain a current physical and review their flight records according to AFI 11-
202, Vol 1 and AFI 11-401.
   5.12.1. Aircrew flying with non-USAF units (i.e. Exchange) do not need to abide by USAF
   guidance, including this AFI and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF
   units, they must complete applicable requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF
   evaluations that expired during their tour. The restrictions in paragraph 5.6.3 of this
   instruction apply to such individuals until successful evaluations are completed.
   5.12.2. MAJCOM/A3s may approve exceptions to requirements for returning Exchange
   aircrew members to complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if they
   determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2
   evaluations (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
   5.12.3. USAF units that use non-USAF aircraft to execute a USAF flying program will
   comply with current USAF guidance, unless when excepted by proper authority. See AFI 11-
   401 for definitions of USAF and US Government aircraft.
5.13. Initial Cadre.
   5.13.1. Aircrew members who are appointed by their MAJCOMs as initial cadre either for a
   new mission set requiring a MSN qualification or for a new MDS where no flight examiner
   currently exists will comply with the intent of this instruction.
   5.13.2. See paragraph 7.5 for guidance on Form 8/8a documentation.
   5.13.3. MAJCOMs will indicate through MFR which aircrew are appointed as initial cadre
   and include in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
42                  AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014


  5.13.4. Tailor recurring evaluations to program requirements and aircraft capabilities.
  Simulators may be used to satisfy recurring evaluation requirements.
  5.13.5. Pilots in these programs will maintain an instrument qualification (see paragraph
  5.2.2). Maintenance of the instrument qualification, if not practical due to the developing
  capabilities of the new mission set and/or MDS, will be accomplished in aircraft possessing
  similar flying qualities/instrumentation as stipulated in the MAJCOM supplement/AFI 11-
  MDS Vol 2/MOU.
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                          43

         procedures for its development and distribution in unit supplement. AFRC Units will
         develop and distribute a local procedures MQF for all flight aircrew members. At
         least 10 percent of closed book examination questions will come from the local
         procedures MQF.
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                           45


          6.4.2.2.1. (BARKSDALE) OGV will produce a Local Procedures MQF consisting
          of 25 questions. The questions will be based on guidance contained in the BAFBI 11-
          250 & AFI 11-2B-52V3_BARKSUP. The Local Procedures MQF will be posted on
          the 2 OGV share point site.
   6.4.3. Instrument Exams. Reference AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program.
   Units will ensure that only those questions relevant to the weapons system(s) and instrument
   procedures within their unit are included in the available questions from which aircrew will
   test.
   6.4.4. Exam Question Review. The MAJCOM, NAF, and OG Stan/Eval functions will
   review all MDS/crew position-specific MQFs, SQBs, and prepared exams (if used) annually
   and after any changes in source documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a
   source document change it may be annotated as the annual review. Units will document
   procedures for the exam reviews in their supplement to this instruction.
       6.4.4.1. (Added-BARKSDALE) Annual Test Review Process. Requisite exams will be
       reviewed annually by OGV testing POCs. Document complete reviews on an MFR
       posted in the front of each type of test’s question bank. This review will fix any
       outstanding bad questions, analyze questions for applicability and update references.
       6.4.4.2. (Added-BARKSDALE) Bad Question Review. PEX testing tracks all missed
       questions. If a question is missed repeatedly or the question is in error, the OGV Staff
       will determine if the question is a bad question. Bad questions will not be graded. The
       test will be replaced if more than 5% of the questions are bad.
6.5. End-of-Course Exams. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses listed in the Air
Force      Education     and    Training    Course     Announcement        (ETCA)    database
(https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) exams to fulfill the requirements
of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite exams.
   6.5.1. The Stan/Eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate with
   the MDS lead MAJCOM to ensure the EOC exam meets the requirements of this instruction
   and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 before awarding credit for requisite completion.
   6.5.2. EOC exam questions do not need to incorporate MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures and
   not conflict with any MQFs.
   6.5.3. All EOC exams that fulfill the requirements of requisite exams will be graded
   according to paragraph 6.8 and entered on the AF Form 8/8a according to paragraph 7.3.5.1.
6.6. Exam Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs exams, units will either
maintain prepared exams for each crew position or generate a unique exam for each aircrew
member.
   6.6.1. If prepared exams are maintained for each crew position:
       6.6.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two exams for each
       crew position.
       6.6.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one exam.
 46                   AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014


       6.6.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information, units are
       not required to maintain separate exams for each crew position.
       6.6.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on each prepared exam each
       calendar year.
   6.6.2. If a unique exam is generated for each aircrew member:
       6.6.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for exam creation.
       6.6.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain at least twice the number of questions
       required for each exam (e.g. if a 50-question exam is generated, there must be at least 100
       questions in the exam database).
   6.6.3. When published guidance changes, the associated prepared exam or exam database
   (depending on method used) will be updated as soon as possible upon receipt.
6.7. Exam Security. Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all requisite exams,
applicable answer sheets, and associated computer-based media.
   6.7.1. (Added-BARKSDALE) Testing Facilities and Administration. Testing will take
   place in the designated testing room in OGV, unless approved by the Chief of OGV. OGV
   will electronically maintain sufficient technical orders, directives and FLIP for all testing.
   Formal testing can be administered by all OGV personnel.
   6.7.2. (Added-BARKSDALE) Attached crewmembers that are not based at Barksdale AFB
   may have their requisite testing sent to their commander for administration. The test will be
   sent back after completion and graded by OGV.
6.8. Grading.
   6.8.1. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs exams on the two-tier grading system (i.e.
   Q/U). Satisfactory performance requires writing the proper actions in the correct sequence,
   not necessarily a verbatim response. The minimum passing grade is 100 percent.
   6.8.1. (AFGSC) Complete boldface exams from memory.
   6.8.2. Written or Computer-Based Examinations. Grade written or computer based
   examinations as a percentage of correct answers. The minimum passing grade is 85 percent.
   All questions missed will be reviewed immediately following the exam.
   6.8.3. Units will grade all requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew
   member’s next flight.
6.9. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam.
   6.9.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination must be
   afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other than Boldface/CAPs, the
   aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
   6.9.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite exam must complete a
   successful reexam by the end of the third month following the date of the first failure, or the
   end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first. Waiver authority to extend the time
   allowed to successfully complete the reexam is the OG/CC (document IAW paragraph
   7.8.3.2.2).
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                            47


   6.9.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
   Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful Boldface/CAPs
   reexam is accomplished.
   6.9.4. Supervised Status.
       6.9.4.1. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite open/closed book or instrument
       exam in supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7 until successful retesting is completed.
       6.9.4.2. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status
       resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination applies only to the
       aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of the instrument exam
       results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all aircraft in which
       instrument qualification is required.
6.10. Unit Periodic Examinations (Optional). If used, MAJCOMs and/or units will include
guidance in their supplements to include procedures for failed exams.
6.10. (AFGSC)Unit Periodic Examinations. Units may use MQFs for informal periodic
testing. Do not use the SQBs for unit periodic examinations. Units will include guidance in
their supplement to include procedures for failed exams.
   6.10.1. Each group/squadron Stan/Eval function may conduct periodic testing for all aircrew.
   The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional knowledge beyond the scope of requisite
   exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or
   operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit.
       6.10.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Each unit will conduct periodic testing at least
       semiannually. Periodic tests are intended to encourage aircrew review of operationally
       relevant topics selected by OGV. OGVs will determine whether the test is administered
       open or closed book and whether proctoring is required. A majority of the questions must
       come from sources other than MAJCOM-approved MQFs (i.e. flight manuals,
       Instructions, SPINS, etc). Classified tests will be handled appropriately. Flight Surgeons
       and non-rated/non-CEA aircrew members are exempt.
       6.10.1.1. (BARKSDALE) Semi-Annual Tests. OGV will develop open book tests to
       evaluate appropriate areas of interest (e.g. crew and formation standards, aircraft
       limitations, tactics). Assigned and attached aircrews are required to complete the test
       semi-annually. For ARMs tracking purposes the six month periods will be 1 Oct - 31 Mar
       and 1 Apr – 30 Sep. Aircrew who fail to complete the semi-annual testing before the end
       of the sixth month will be grounded until completion of the previous semi-annual test.
       The test is non proctored and correctable to 100%.
   6.10.2. Administration of the exam is at the discretion of the MAJCOM and/or unit.
   6.10.3. Periodic exams will not count as a requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy
   the requirement for a periodic exam.
   6.10.4. (Added-AFGSC) All units will establish a Boldface written examination program
   for all applicable crew positions. As a minimum, all applicable aircrew members will
   successfully complete a Boldface written examination prior to the first flight of each month
   during the month in which it applies. Failure of this written exam grounds the individual until
   a successful examination is accomplished.

     6.10.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) A Boldface written examination will be accomplished for
     each MDS for which the aircrew is qualified (if any portion of the Boldface is different
     from the primary aircraft).
     6.10.4.1. (BARKSDALE) In addition to paragraph 6.10.4. (Added-AFGSC) aircrew
     will complete a 20 question MQF test prior to the first flight of each month. The test is
     non proctored and correctable to 100%.
     6.10.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) Squadron           operations   supervisers  or  designated
     representatives will grade boldface written examinations IAW AFI 11-202V2 paragraph
     6.8.1.
     6.10.4.2. (BARKSDALE) Designated representatives are defined as any instructor of
     like specialty or any instructor pilot.
  6.10.5. (Added-BARKSDALE) No-notice closed book testing may be conducted at the
  discretion of the OG/CC, the SQ/CC, or OGV. Failure of this test grounds the individual
  until a successful re-test is accomplished.

                                            Chapter 7

                                      DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications for which an aircrew member is to be evaluated are
determined from the unit certification document. This chapter provides documentation guidance
for members that require an in-flight evaluation to establish qualification. See Chapter 8 for
documentation guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-rated aircrew that
only require an examination to establish qualification.
   7.1.1. The results of aircrew evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 8/8a. The
   chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF Form 942,
   Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF.
   7.1.2. In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is authorized, to include use
   of electronic signatures and wholly electronic FEFs IAW MAJCOM supplement guidance. In
   all instances, computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms as published on the USAF E-
   Publishing web site.
   7.1.2. (AFGSC) IAW unit supplement.           Units choosing to use electronic FEFs will use
   PEX.
7.2. Qualifications versus Certifications. Qualifications are attained through evaluations and
documented on the AF Form 8/8a, as applicable. Certifications are attained through methods
other than evaluation (e.g. commander certifications, flight lead upgrades, etc.) and may be
documented on an AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications or on a unit certification
document signed by an authorized official.
7.2. (AFGSC)(N/A AFRC) Qualifications and Certifications. Use the AF Form 4348, USAF
Aircrew Certifications, to document all aircrew certifications, and complete it IAW paragraph
7.6
7.3. AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. The AF Form 8/8a is the source document used to record and verify the
   qualification of an aircrew member.
       7.3.1.1. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification in a single aircraft.
       7.3.1.2. Use of the AF Form 8a is optional for aircrew maintaining qualification in
       multiple aircraft and/or multiple series qualification in the same MDS or are Universal
       Qualified.
       7.3.1.3. Completion of an AF Form 8/8a is accomplished by four individuals: the flight
       examiner, a Reviewing Officer, a Final Approving Officer, and the examinee.
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8, Attachment 4 for
   sample AF Forms 8a.
       7.3.2.1. In all instances of data entry, if an electronic form is used, the format required by
       the electronic form will be used (see also paragraph 7.1.2).
50                   AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014


     7.3.2.2. For date fields use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit year format
     (e.g. 24 Jun 12).
     7.3.2.3. The “Eligibility Period” and “Expiration Date of Qualification” blocks will use a
     three-letter month and two-digit year format (Jun 12).
     7.3.2.4. Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e. annotating the type evaluation,
     “INSTR”), use upper and lower case letters.
     7.3.2.5. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
     data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
     desired.
     7.3.2.5. (AFGSC) Use the AF Form 8 format in the PEX Stan/Eval module or a
     MAJCOM- approved alternate.
  7.3.3. Date Completed.
     7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date of the evaluation requisites (ground or flight
     phase) or the additional training if assigned.
     7.3.3.2. (Form 8a) Use the latest completion date of all MDS listed.
  7.3.4. - Examinee Identification.
     7.3.4.1. Name, Rank (USAF-standard abbreviated or non-abbreviated rank is acceptable)
     and last four of Social Security Number (SSN).

         7.3.4.3.1. Enter the MDS in which the evaluation was given
         7.3.4.3.2. (Form 8a) Enter the aircraft MDS in which the flight phase evaluation
         was given. When no flight phase evaluation was accomplished or when aircrew are
         qualified in two or more aircraft IAW Universal Qualification guidelines, enter the
         primary aircraft MDS.
         7.3.4.3.3. Enter the examinee’s highest qualification reflecting the intention of the
         evaluation in that particular MDS. Note: Examiner (e.g. EP, EF, etc.) is not a
         qualification, it is a certification, and should only be entered when the flight examiner
         is receiving a SPOT Flight Examiner Objectivity evaluation IAW MAJCOM
         supplements.
     7.3.4.4. Eligibility Period.
         7.3.4.4.1. Enter the 6-month period preceding the expiration date from the last

         previous evaluation is extended under the provisions of paragraph 5.8.3.2.3, enter the
         6-month period preceding the original expiration date (SQ/CCs extend only the
         expiration date, not the eligibility period).
         7.3.4.4.4. Dual entries are authorized for misaligned combined evaluations (e.g., if
         last INSTM evaluation expires Nov 12 and QUAL evaluation expires Jan 13, enter
         “INSTM: Jun-Nov 12/QUAL: Aug 12-Jan 13” for an INSTM/QUAL evaluation).
  7.3.5. - Qualification.
     7.3.5.1. Ground Phase.
         7.3.5.1.1. Examination/Check.
            7.3.5.1.1.1. Make a separate entry for each ground requisite exam/evaluation.
            Discrepancies will be noted in the examiner’s remarks (see paragraph 7.3.7.3.3).
            7.3.5.1.1.2. If requisites exceed available lines, make combined entries or
            document additional requisite completion in the Comments section.
            7.3.5.1.1.3. Annotate an EPE as 1, 2, or 3 regardless of whether all or a portion of

52                 AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014


            7.3.5.1.3.4. Enter failed EPE grades with a successful recheck as follows: 3/1.
     7.3.5.2. Flight Phase.
        7.3.5.2.1. (Form 8a) If applicable governing instructions require non-rated aircrew
        to demonstrate in-flight proficiency in more than one MDS, MAJCOMs may use a
        separate AF Form 8a for each MDS with flight phase evaluations IAW multiple
        qualification guidance in paragraph 5.10 and universal qualification guidance in
        paragraph 5.11.
        7.3.5.2.2. Mission/Check.
            7.3.5.2.2.1. IAW paragraph 5.2, use the following designations to describe the
            purpose of the evaluation(s): INSTM, QUAL, MSN, INSTR, or SPOT. If
            combined, include the designation of each evaluation (e.g., QUAL/MSN,
            INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.).
            7.3.5.2.2.2. Use the following prefixes, when applicable, to describe the type of
            evaluation: INIT, RQ, N/N and/or SIM. More than one prefix may be used to

               7.3.5.2.2.2.1. The only annotations of INSTR used are INIT INSTR and RQ
               INSTR as described in paragraph 5.2.4.
               7.3.5.2.2.2.2. INSTR will not be used for periodic evaluations as the AF Form
               8/8a aircraft/crew position is already annotated with the instructor designation
               (e.g. IB, IN, IP)
               7.3.5.2.2.2.3. When requalification deals with regaining a complete loss of
               instructor qualification, document it as RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
            7.3.5.2.2.3. Make a single line entry to document the flight(s)/event(s) used to
            complete the evaluation.
            7.3.5.2.2.4. Make multiple single line entries for each flight/event if two or more
            flights/events are required and administered by either different flight examiners or
            on separate days.
            7.3.5.2.2.5. Where a single mission (such as airlift tasking) consists of multiple
            flights over one or more days with the same flight examiners, a single line entry
            may be used.
            7.3.5.2.2.6. (Added-AFGSC) When an ATD mission is used to accomplish a
            required Flight Phase event, make a line entry as applicable (e.g. SIM QUAL,
            SIM INSTM/QUAL/MSN).
        7.3.5.2.3. Date.
            7.3.5.2.3.1. Enter the date the flight/event was completed.
            7.3.5.2.3.2. For evaluations where a single mission consists of multiple flights
            over one or more days (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2.5), enter the inclusive dates of the
            flight(s). Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
            7.3.5.2.3.3. For evaluations conducted on missions consisting of a single flight
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                           53


            spanning more than one day, use a single line entry with the date the mission was
            completed. Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
     7.3.5.3. Qualification Level.
        7.3.5.3.1. Annotate the examinee’s overall qualification level IAW the definitions of
        paragraph 5.3.3 by placing a “1” (for Q1) or “2” (for Q2) in the qualified block or a
        “3” (for Q3) in the unqualified block.
        7.3.5.3.2. Combined evaluations (e.g., INSTM/QUAL, INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.)
        require only one grade if all evaluations were awarded the same overall level.
            7.3.5.3.2.1. If the overall level varies for each type of evaluation accomplished,
            indicate the qualification level for each part separately (e.g., “INSTM: 1” and
            “QUAL: 2” in the qualified block or “INSTM/MSN: 1” in the qualified block and
            “QUAL: 3” in the unqualified block).
        7.3.5.3.3. (Form 8a) Place a 1, 2, or 3 in the Qual Level block next to the applicable
        flight phase.
        7.3.5.3.4. (Form 8a) This section does not apply to Universal Qualified aircrew
        members or to crewmembers that do not require a flight phase evaluation (see
        Chapter 8).
     7.3.5.4. Expiration Date of Qualification.
        7.3.5.4.1. IAW paragraph 5.8.1. for evaluations that establish a new eligibility
        period, enter the month and year that is 17 months after the month in which the flight
        phase of the evaluation was successfully completed.
        7.3.5.4.2. For evaluations that do not establish a new eligibility period, enter “N/A.”
        7.3.5.4.3. Combined evaluations require only one date if all parts of the evaluation
        were successfully completed and/or “N/A” if all parts were assigned an unqualified
        grade.
            7.3.5.4.3.1. For combined evaluations where one component is successfully
            completed and/or one component is assigned an unqualified grade, indicate by
            assigning a new expiration date for those portions completed successfully, and
            “N/A” for those portions awarded an unqualified grade (e.g., QUAL 1 and
            INSTM 3, then enter “QUAL-Jul 12” under Qualified and “INSTM-N/A” under
            Unqualified).
                7.3.5.4.3.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) The latest flight phase event accomplished
                for each component of the evaluation (e.g. QUAL, MSN, etc.) will be used to
                update that qualification expiration date.
        7.3.5.4.4. (Form 8a) For evaluations without a flight phase requirement that
        establish a new eligibility period enter the month and year that is 17 months after the
        month in which the latest ground requisite was successfully completed.
        7.3.5.4.5. (Form 8a) For evaluations with a flight phase that establish a new
        eligibility period, enter the month and year that is 17 months after the month in which
        the flight phase evaluation was successfully completed.

           only ground phase examination requisites for qualification.
           7.3.6.2.2. The Reviewing and Final Approving Officers (those officers holding these
           positions, or acting in their stead during the period of the signature process -- not
           necessarily the date of the evaluation) will review the content of the AF Form 8/8a
           and the flight examiner’s overall assessment, ensure all required additional training is
           adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete, and will place an “X” in
           the “Concur” block.
           7.3.6.2.2. (AFGSC) Personnel receiving evaluations away from home-station will
           have AF Forms 8 reviewed by officers from their assigned unit. Table 7.1 does not
           apply to evaluations conducted as part of a FTU syllabus. AFGSC-owned FTUs will
           establish AF Form 8 review/approval procedures in their unit supplement.
              7.3.6.2.2.1. If either or both officers do not agree with any portion of the Form
              8/8a, the overall grade will not be changed, but the dissenting officer will place an
              “X” in the “Do Not Concur” block on his/her line of the AF Form 8/8a.
              7.3.6.2.2.2. If “Do Not Concur” is marked, the non-concurring officer(s) will
              provide justification (e.g. reason for non-concurrence, suggested modifications to
              additional training as recommended by the flight examiner, etc.) IAW paragraph
              7.3.7.4 and/or paragraph 7.3.7.5.

60                  AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014


     7.3.8.1. (AFGSC) The completed temporary form (AF Form 4068, AFGSC Form 8A or
     MAJCOM-approved alternative), with an overall grade written and the flight examiner’s
     signature on it can serve as a temporary record until the AF Form 8 and all phases of the
     evaluation are completed.
     7.3.8.2. The temporary evaluation documentation will include examinee, examiner, type
     evaluation, qualification level, requisites results, and date completed. List any
     discrepancies by area/subarea, any restrictions, any additional training and any additional
     training due dates.
     7.3.8.3. The examiner completing the evaluation will sign and date the temporary
     evaluation documentation.
        7.3.8.3.1. (Added-BARKSDALE) SEFEs should complete the Temporary Form 8
        NLT the next duty day following each portion of the evaluation. Document any
        remaining additional training and their required completion dates on the Temporary
        Form 8 as required. Place the original Temporary Form 8 in the OGV Temporary
        Form 8 inbox. For other than Q-1 evaluations send a copy to the SQ/CC, SQ/DO,
        squadron training flight, and OGV for appropriate actions.
     7.3.8.4. Remove temporary evaluation documentation when the permanent AF Form
     8/8a is filed in the FEF.
     7.3.8.5. File the completed AF Form 8/8a in the FEF not later than the end of the third
     month following the date completed annotated on the AF Form 8/8a.
        7.3.8.5.1. (Added-BARKSDALE) NLT the next duty day following completion of
        the evaluation OGV should validate completion, update PEX database, and submit an
        AF Form 1522 to the appropriate squadron for input into ARMS. Additionally, NLT
        7 duty days following completion of the evaluation, OGV should e-mail the
        completed electronic AF Form 8 to the flight examiner for review and electronic
        signature. The evaluator will e-mail the electronically signed AF Form 8 back to
        OGV for coordination of Reviewing Officer, Final Approving Officer and evaluatee
        electronic signatures. The original temporary Forms 8 will be placed in the member’s
        FEF.
        7.3.8.5.2. (Added-BARKSDALE) Once required signatures are obtained; OGV will
        file the AF Form 8 in the Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF), archive the Temporary
        Forms 8 and update the AF Form 942 (Record of Evaluation), and
        accomplish/document an FEF review within 60 days from the AF Form 8 completion
        date. If additional training is assigned, return the AF Form 8 to the reviewing officer
        to initial the “Date Additional Training Complete” block within one month of training
        completion.
     7.3.8.6. Further guidance concerning temporary evaluation documentation will be
     outlined in MAJCOM and unit supplement.
     7.3.8.6. (AFGSC) Use the AFGSC Form 8A, AF Form 4068, or MAJCOM approved
     alternative as the temporary evaluation certificate.
     7.3.8.6. (BARKSDALE) The 2 BW will use temporary evaluation certificates modified
     from the AFGSC Form 8A IAW AFI 11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_I. The temporary
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                             61


      evaluation certificate is referred to as a Temporary Form 8 and tailored to the event
      evaluated (e.g. flight, EPE, T-4 or weapon pre-flight).
      7.3.8.7. (Added-BARKSDALE) OGV will track requisite examination completion in
      PEX database and track flight phase events on the Temporary Form 8. OGV should enter
      all pertinent requisite data into the PEX database NLT the COB next duty day after the

7.6. (AFGSC)(N/A AFRC )AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. Use of the AF
Form 4348 is mandatory in AFGSC.
   7.6.1. Purpose. The AF Form 4348 provides a record of aircrew certification that may be
   kept in the FEF.
      7.6.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 4348 in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1
      documenting certifications by assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew
      members with aircraft certifications in multiple MDS aircraft which do not require
      qualification in each aircraft (e.g. F-16C and F-16CM), only one AF Form 4348 is
      required; specify the primary mission MDS designation.
      7.6.1.2. Unit Stan/Eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
      aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
      certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
      7.6.1.3. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review previous AF Form 4348
      entries to determine all applicable certifications of new assigned/attached aircrew
      member. Then, document applicable aircrew certifications accepted by the gaining flying
      unit commander on a new AF Form 4348.
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                            65


     7.6.1.4. The OGV/squadron Stan/Eval Chief or other individual designated by the
     SQ/CC will sign a one line entry below all other entries verifying that above certification
     transcriptions are accurate.
     7.6.1.5. Do not use AF Form 4348 to document one-time training/new equipment unless
     directed by MAJCOM.
     7.6.1.6. Appropriate guidance that may require aircrew certification using AF Form 4348
     entry include MAJCOM and/or supplement; AFI11-2MDS Vol 1; AFI11-2MDS Vol 3.
         7.6.1.6.1. (Added-AFGSC) Units transisitioning to AF Form 4348. Generating a
         AF Form 4348 for exisiting certifications is not required. AF Form 4348 will be
         generated for new certification or PCS. For new certifications, post the AF Form
         4348 on top of existing certification documents. Keep previous certification
         documents for historical purposes.
         7.6.1.6.2. (Added-AFGSC) Units may, at their discretion, choose to transcribe
         current certifications on the AF Form 4348. If this is done, units will keep existing
         certification documents as historical record of previous certification.
  7.6.2. General Data Entry.
     7.6.2.1. Complete individual identification block with last name, first name, middle
     initial, any titles (e.g., Jr. or II), last four of SSN, unit MDS and unit (assigned/attached

     approve or certify an aircrew member for a specific position or event.
     7.6.3.7. If a certification is given with restrictions, state the restrictions on the AF Form
     4348 in the Remarks block.
  7.6.4. Decertification. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for
  Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
     7.6.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
         7.6.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
         but also applies to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
         substandard performance).
         7.6.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, place an “X” in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7 for example.
     7.6.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
     performance.
         7.6.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
         occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI11-2 Vol 1, when instructor certified events
         become core mission events, or when a higher certification is obtained making the
         previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also applicable for
         decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than substandard
         performance.
         7.6.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification, place an “X” in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7. Note: For decertification
         due to loss of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the effective date of
         decertification will be the date of certification loss.
         7.6.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
         Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: annotate “Renamed (new
         title)” under Remarks.
         7.6.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
         Stan/Eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 4348 indicating the new MDS and
         transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.6.1.3.
  7.6.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional
  information for an AF Form 4348 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the
  AF Form 4348.
  7.6.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 4348. Units may use a computer-generated AF
  Form 4348 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                            67


   maintained. Computer-generated AF forms must mirror AF forms published on the Air Force
   e-Publishing web site.
      7.6.6.1. A computer-generated AF Form 4348 must be signed IAW guidance in this
      section. The signature on a computer-generated AF Form 4348 certifies:
          7.6.6.1.1. New or rescinded certification attained while assigned/attached to unit of
          certifying official.
          7.6.6.1.2. All cumulative entries were maintained; that they were signed or had
          proper documentation; or were carried forward from a previously signed computer-
          generated AF Form 4348.
          7.6.6.1.2. (AFGSC) The last line is the only signature required on a computer-
          generated form.
   7.6.7. Unit Supplement. Describe unit AF Form 4348 procedures/program. Include a list of
   certifications applicable to the unit with appropriate source documents and designated
   certifying officials. Document procedures to ensure certifications reflected on AF Form 4348
   are also included in ARMS. Annotate if someone other than the Chief of OGV/squadron
   Stan/Eval has been authorized by the SQ/CC to sign the last line of an AF Form 4348 to
   signify transcription accuracy.
7.7. AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. The AF Form 942 is an index providing pertinent
information extracted from all the AF Forms 8/8a accomplished by the aircrew member. See
example at Attachment 5.
   7.7.1. Data Entry.
      7.7.1.1. Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e. annotating the type evaluation,
      “INSTR”), use upper and lower case letters.
      7.7.1.2. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
      data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
      desired.
      7.7.1.3. A one-line entry is used for all evaluations with the exception of those in which
      the qualification levels awarded on portions of a combined evaluation are not all the
      same.
      7.7.1.3. (AFGSC) Single AF Forms 8 containing multiple mission upgrade evaluations
      require only one entry on the AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation, to reflect completion
      of the upgrade. The date on the AF Form 942 will be the latest completion date (ground
      or flight phase) of the evaluation including additional training.
      7.7.1.4. For combined evaluations in which different qualification levels are awarded for
      any of the portions, a single line entry will be made for each different qualification level
      awarded indicating which portions of the combined evaluation received that qualification
      level.
      7.7.1.5. Use each AF Form 942 until it is completely filled. If additional blocks not
      needed, “Z” out any unused blocks.

   made for each change in the individual’s MAJCOM based on a Permanent Change of Station
   (PCS)/Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA). Do not annotate a change of MAJCOM if
   the individual is receiving an evaluation from an evaluator in a different MAJCOM unless
   the individual is enrolled in a formal training program.
   7.7.7. Computer Generated AF Form 942. A computer generated AF Form 942 may be
   used as long as cumulative entries are retained. Electronic copies of the AF Form 942 should
   be forwarded with the FEF when the individual moves to a new squadron.
7.8. Flight Evaluation Folders (FEF). The FEF contains the source documents that constitute
the history of flying qualifications for each aircrew member.
   7.8.1. Maintenance.

      AF Forms 8/8a, AF Forms 942, AF Forms 4348 (if used), and any additional MAJCOM
      and/or unit specified items. EXCEPTION: for flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-
      rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification do not require an
      FEF, documentation will be IAW paragraph 8.1.
      7.8.1.2. The FEF must be maintained by a Stan/Eval functional office - normally in the
      organization to which the individual is assigned or attached for flying.
      7.8.1.2. (AFGSC) The host unit Stan/Eval office will maintain FEFs for attached
      personnel. Exception: Headquarters AFGSC and NAF Flight Examiners may maintain
      their own FEFs at their duty stations.

     7.8.1.5. Individuals assigned or attached to other than USAF units may use the format of
     the service to which they are attached to document their history of qualifications.
  7.8.2. Electronic FEFs.
     7.8.2.1. For electronic FEFs, any hard copy historical information (once incorporated
     into the electronic FEF system) will be archived with the Stan/Eval function that
     maintains the FEFs. Archive method will be at unit discretion.
     7.8.2.2. Scanned versions of historical documents will be saved IAW AFI 33-364,
     Records Disposition—Procedures and Responsibilities.
     7.8.2.3. Electronic FEF systems must be able to produce hard copies of FEF products,
     when needed, consistent with the guidance in this AFI. Additionally, the electronic FEF
     must be transportable.
  7.8.3. Contents. Divide the FEF into two sections:
     7.8.3.1. (left side). This Section contains AF Forms 942, AF Forms 4348 (if used), and
     any items authorized by the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement. Section I may contain
     two sub-sections.
         7.8.3.1.1. AF Forms 942 will be placed on top in chronological order with the most
         recent on top, followed by the AF Form 4348 (if used).
         7.8.3.1.2. Any additional information as directed by MAJCOM and/or unit
         supplement will be placed under the AF Form 942 and 4348 (if used).
         7.8.3.1.3. If the FEF is not maintained at the same base with the individual’s FRF, a
         copy of the most recent AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or
         Special Operational Duty, and AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training
         Record, may be filed in this section behind and MAJCOM and/or unit directed items.
     7.8.3.2. (right side). This Section contains AF Forms 8/8a and any related MFRs for all
     evaluations listed on the AF Form 942.
         7.8.3.2.1. AF Forms 8/8a. File AF Forms 8/8a in chronological order with the most
         recent on top. Individuals who maintain qualification in two or more MDSs or two or
         more crew positions in the same MDS will file AF Forms 8/8a in chronological order
         – without consideration of MDS or crew position.
         7.8.3.2.2. MFRs.
            7.8.3.2.2.1. MFRs documenting waivers, extensions, and/or unusual
            circumstances to potentially be included in an AF Form 8/8a are filed on top of
            the affected AF Form 8/8a.
                7.8.3.2.2.1.1. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the
                applicable AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional
                Comments, when action is complete.
                7.8.3.2.2.1.2. Once MFR information is incorporated onto the AF Form 8/8a,
                remove the MFR from the FEF.
            7.8.3.2.2.2. Expiration Date Extensions (see also paragraph 5.8.3.2).
70                  AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014


                7.8.3.2.2.2.1. On the expiration date extension MFR specify extension
                authority, the new expiration date, and a brief description of the extension.
                7.8.3.2.2.2.2. MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any affected
                periodic evaluation.
            7.8.3.2.2.3. Permanent MFRs. MFRs become a permanent part of the FEF only
            when a Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by
            a later Form 8 (see paragraph 7.8.6.1) or an unusual circumstance cannot be
            documented any other way.
  7.8.4. Hard-Copy Folders.
     7.8.4.1. Folders must be letter size, able to separate contents into two sections and
     constructed of heavy stock (recommend press board folder or equivalent).
     7.8.4.2. Standard 2 ¾-inch metal fasteners may be used.
     7.8.4.3. Affix a label bearing the individual’s name and last four of SSN to the inside
     back cover so that the folder may be identified when filed. Include additional information
     on the label if required by MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
     7.8.4.4. Folders must bear the “For Official Use Only” label/stamp on both sides of the
     FEF.
  7.8.5. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
  and how to implement the periodic review of FEFs.
     7.8.5.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
     aircrew members to verify their qualification(s) (and certifications on AF Form 4348 if
     used) prior to their first flight.
     7.8.5.1. (AFGSC) Initial Review. The gaining squadron Stan/Eval will review the FEF
     for all newly assigned personnel prior to the first flight at the gaining squadron.
     Determine the individual’s current qualification, any required training, and document any
     major discrepancies. If the aircrew member’s qualification is in question, make every
     reasonable attempt to contact the member’s losing Stan/Eval office to reconcile the
     discrepancy. The member’s gaining final approving officer (per Table 7.1) will make the
     final determination of the member’s status of qualifications and certifications. The initial
     review is documented on the AF Form 942. Document any discrepancies discovered
     during the review IAW AFI 11-202V2 paragraph
        7.8.5.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the qualification
        of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable documentation in
        Sections I and II of the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.2. Following the initial review, the unit maintaining the FEF is responsible
        only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.3. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
        Stan/Eval function at the unit/squadron to which they are attached to fly, the
        Stan/Eval function of that unit/squadron will also review the FEF prior to their first
        flight.
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                          71


     7.8.5.2. Posting Review.
        7.8.5.2.1. The Stan/Eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a and AF Forms
        4348 (if used) when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and completeness.
        7.8.5.2.2. The Form 8/8a review will confirm that the eligibility period and
        qualification as documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events and
        requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that all signatures and
        initials are obtained within the allotted time (see paragraph 7.3.8.5).
        7.8.5.2.3. The AF Form 4348 (if used) will be reviewed for correct certification
        signature and to ensure all previous entries are accurate and accounted for.
        7.8.5.2.4. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM supplement.
        7.8.5.2.4. (AFGSC) Units will establish procedures for documenting the posting
        review in their unit supplement to this instruction.
        7.8.5.2.4. (BARKSDALE) OGV will track completion of the posting FEF reviews
        with a Posting/Annual Review Cover Sheet.
     7.8.5.3. Periodic Review.
        7.8.5.3.1. The Stan/Eval function will review all applicable FEFs to confirm
        expiration dates used to track required aircrew qualification evaluations are the same
        as those listed in the FEFs. Periodic review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is
        not required.
        7.8.5.3.1. (BARKSDALE) OGV will conduct a full annual review of the FEF in
        conjunction with each posting review.
        7.8.5.3.2. The interval between reviews will not exceed the standard qualification
        period window unless a more restrictive review period is established by the
        MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.2. (AFGSC) The interval between reviews will not exceed 12 months. For
        example, a review accomplished 1 January 2009 must be accomplished again no later
        than 31 January 2010. The annual review will be documented on the AF Form 942 or
        on an OGV derived form. Discrepancies noted during the annual review will be
        documented IAW AFI 11-202V2 paragraph 7.8.6.
        7.8.5.3.2. (BARKSDALE) Annual Review of FEF. OGV will establish an annual
        review date based on the initial review and recurring annuals based on the latest
        annual and/or posting/annual reviews.
        7.8.5.3.3. Document the periodic review IAW MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.3. (BARKSDALE) OGV will track completion of the annual FEF reviews
        with a Posting/Annual Review Cover Sheet. Place this cover sheet in front of the
        most recent AF Form 8 to be reviewed in the FEF.
  7.8.6. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8/8a, AF
  Forms 4348 (if used), AF Form 942, and any MAJCOM-directed documentation.
72                  AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014


  7.8.6. (AFGSC) The capacity in which the individual will act until the individual meets the
  requirements of the unit mission will be documented in the unit certification document (e.g.,
  letter of Xs). Once the individual meets the requirements of their crew qualification, amend
  the certification document.
     7.8.6.1. Major Discrepancies. Discrepancies that affect the qualification of the affected
     aircrew member.
     7.8.6.1. (AFGSC) Major Discrepancies. “Discrepancies that alter the qualification of
     the affected aircrew member” are characterized as major discrepancies and are defined as
     any error that would cause the AF Form 8 not to grant the qualification intended, or cause
     the aircrew member to continue to fly after their qualification expired. Errors in the
     “Qualification Level” blocks, the “Date Additional Training Completed” block, and the
     “Expiration Date of Qualification” block are major discrepancies. Administrative errors
     in the “Name”, “Rank”, “SSAN”, “Organization and Location”, “ACFT/Crew Position”
     and “Eligibility Period” blocks are not major discrepancies.
         7.8.6.1.1. Major discrepancies are documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section
         I or II immediately above the affected AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348 (if used), or in
         chronological order for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348
         (if used).
         7.8.6.1.2. MFRs documenting similar major discrepancies found on multiple AF
         Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.
     7.8.6.2. Minor Discrepancies. Discrepancies that do not affect the qualification (and/or
     certifications if using the AF Form 4348) of the affected aircrew member (e.g. typos,
     formatting and misspellings).
         7.8.6.2.1. Minor discrepancies are documented on a non-permanent record as defined
         by the MAJCOM or unit supplement to this instruction and need not reside in the
         FEF.
         7.8.6.2.1. (BARKSDALE) Use the Minor Discrepancy Tracking Sheet to document
         all AF Form 8 minor discrepancies. Place this sheet in front of the latest AF Form 8
         in the FEF. The minor discrepancy sheet will remain in the FEF. After 8 AF/OV
         formal visits, the log will be placed immediately beneath the “Stop Sign” and a new
         sheet will be started.
     7.8.6.3. Corrections.
         7.8.6.3.1. AF Form 8/8a. As a source document, the AF Form 8/8a may be
         corrected by use of white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document
         provided the flight examiner signing Section III of the form initials the correction. If
         the original FE is not available then document the discrepancy IAW paragraphs
         7.8.6.1 or 7.8.6.2. When the original FE is not available, OGV Chiefs may also
         correct minor discrepancies as prescribed in MAJCOM supplements.
         7.8.6.3.2. AF Form 942. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may be altered
         without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected aircrew member and the
         contents of the FEF.
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                          73


         7.8.6.3.3. AF Form 4348 (if used). AF Forms 4348 may be corrected by use of
         white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document provided the certifying
         official signing that line of the AF Form 4348 initials the correction. For significant
         corrections that alter the certification’s intent, make a new AF Form 4348 entry.
         7.8.6.3.4. Electronic Corrections. If the system used to store the record does not
         allow corrections to be made, then document the discrepancy IAW paragraph 7.8.6.1
         and/or paragraph 7.8.6.2.
  7.8.7. Transfer of FEF.
     7.8.7.1. Retention of Records. Retain all records in the FEF until reviewed by the
     gaining unit. After review, return to the individual those forms not retained in the FEF.
     7.8.7.2. Formal Training Graduates. For Formal Training School graduates reporting
     directly to an overseas command for a short tour, retain formal training school records for
     transfer to the subsequent gaining unit.
     7.8.7.3. PCS of Individual. Aircrew members will normally hand-carry their FEF along
     with their FRF to the gaining organization.
         7.8.7.3.1. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization will mail the
         folder to the gaining unit via registered mail.
         7.8.7.3.2. Mail any records not included in the FEF to the gaining organization with
         clear identification of the individual concerned.
         7.8.7.3.3. When mailing an FEF or any of its contents, retain a copy (hard or soft
         copy is acceptable) until the gaining organization has received the original FEF.
  7.8.8. Disposition of FEF.
     7.8.8.1. Dispose of the aircrew FEF according to the Air Force Records Disposition
     Schedule (RDS) and Air Force guidance concerning the protection of Personally
     Identifiable Information.
     7.8.8.2. Outdated certification documents, ARMS products, medical recommendations
     and miscellaneous documentation identified during reviews will be returned to the
     aircrew member for disposal.

                                          Chapter 8

                                SPECIALIZED AIRCREW

8.1. Purpose. This chapter provides additional guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, Combat
Camera, and non-rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification.
   8.1.1. Initial and periodic qualification consists of a written (open or closed book)
   examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion of the examination,
   members will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal qualification).
   8.1.2. MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and/or MDS-Specific
   qualification requirements.
   8.1.3. Qualification requirements will be documented on an AF Form 1522, ARMS
   Additional Training Accomplishment Report, and stored in ARMS in the Formal Training
   module with currency tracked in the Training module. No AF Form 8/8a or FEF is required;
   however, the Stan/Eval function of the unit to which specialized aircrew are
   assigned/attached for flying will verify that ARMS information is logged appropriately.
   When MAJCOMs or subordinate units require a flight phase, or if directed by the applicable
   MDS-Specific Volume 2, document IAW Chapter 7 (to include creating an FEF).
8.2. Evaluations. Initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required) examinations are considered
QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this AFI, but may be prescribed in
MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
   8.2.1. Flight Surgeons. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by AFMOA/SG3P.
   8.2.1. (BARKSDALE) Flight Surgeons. In addition to the basic open book examination,
   flight surgeons will take a closed book exam consisting of 20 egress and safety of flight
   related questions from the pilot B-52 MQF and accomplish the EW Boldface. OGV will
   notify flight surgeons in writing 90 days prior to the expiration of their 17-month
   qualification exam. OGV will provide a copy of the latest unit-developed MQF. Once the
   basic examination and the closed book exam are complete, an evaluation date for that flight
   surgeon will be entered into ARMS to update their Flight Check currency.
   8.2.2. Combat Camera. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by the Combat Camera career field manager (CFM), in coordination with HQ
   USAF/A3O-AT and using commands.
   8.2.3. Non-Rated Aircrew Members. Test questions will come from the lead MAJCOM
   Master Question Files (MQFs).

                          EVALUATIONS)

9.1. FCIF.
   9.1.1. Units will establish and maintain a library consisting of a current read file and
   publications. This library will consist of a minimum of four volumes as listed in Table 9.1 in
   either hardcopy or electronic format.
   9.1.1. (BARKSDALE) OGV is the OPR for the FCIF program. OGV will:
      9.1.1.1. (Added-BARKSDALE) Exclusively issue FCIF Volume I Parts B and C after
      OG/CC approval.
      9.1.1.2. (Added-BARKSDALE) Maintain an electronic copy of FCIF library Volumes
      I-IV on the OGV share point site.
      9.1.1.3. (Added-BARKSDALE) Maintain a hard copy of FCIF Volume I in OGV.
   9.1.2. FCIFs may be issued to alert crewmembers to publications changes for TOs or AFIs
   that affect aircraft operations, but actual publication changes must be accomplished IAW
   established procedural guidance, to include AFI 33-360 (as applicable) and TO 00-5-1.
      9.1.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Flight Crew Publications. Unit commanders are
      responsible for ensuring aircrew members are aware of all information published in
      current technical orders and flight-related publications before flying. Unit commanders
      will notify aircrew members through Part B of Volume I of the unit FCIF and Go/No Go
      procedures to ensure they review new changes and supplements prior to their next flight
      IAW AFI 11-215_AFGSC SUP.
          9.1.2.1.1. (Added-BARKSDALE) OGV                           will              validate
          AFIs/T.O.s/changes/supplements for completeness and accuracy prior to distribution,
          and release of FCIF Part B to notify aircrews of flight manual changes. Aircrews will
          acknowledge receipt of flying T.O.s by signing the FCIF Part B releasing the new
          T.O.s/changes/ supplements in PEX prior to next flight.
          9.1.2.1.2. (Added-BARKSDALE) An annual flight manuals review for the flying
          publication kits is conducted by OGV IAW AFI 11-215 in conjunction with the LEP
          check. OGV will issue a FCIF Part B annually directing aircrew to do the same on
          individual flight publications.
   9.1.3. Required Volumes. Volume I is a table of contents for all volumes and current read
   file items, Volumes II through IV are made up of publications and flight manuals, and
   Volume V (optional) is reserved for flight safety information. If units choose hardcopy
   format and the contents of any volume exceed the capacity of its binder, use an additional
   binder and identify the first and subsequent binders by a letter of sequence (e.g., IIIA, IIIB).
   Label binders on the spine indicating Volume and Title as follows:
   9.1.3. (AFGSC) Required Volumes. Locate the FCIF where it is readily accessible to
   aircrews for flight planning. Do not remove FCIF volumes without signing them out using
 76                  AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014


   an AF Form 614, Change Out Record. The FCIF serves as the master copy for aircrew
   publications and must be accurately posted. Publications issued to aircrew members must
   mirror the FCIF. If required publications are on order, place a memo for record in the
   appropriate locations in the library binders. At the OG/CC’s discretion, the FCIF library may
   be electronic, provided measures are in place to ensure currency of publications and
   unrestricted access by crewmembers. Units will support deployed forces with appropriate
   FCIF information. Units will develop a deployment plan to successfully transfer or build a
   duplicate process to provide timely FCIF information to deployed aircrew.
      9.1.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Wing/Group agencies who wish to disseminate information
      through an FCIF will submit the information to OGV for coordination and distribution
      (Volume V excluded). Items entered into Volume I will be limited to those items that
      contain information temporary in nature. To prevent overwhelming the aircrew members
      with unnecessary details, salient points may be extracted from lengthy documents or
      highlighted if inclusion in Volume I is necessary. Above the Wing/Group level, the NAF
      or MAJCOM Stan/ Eval function is the focal point for FCIF information.
      9.1.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) Units utilizing electronic media will maintain backup copies
      of FCIF Volumes I and II (paper or electronic) in case of connectivity problems, external
      power supply problems, or unit deployment/field conditions.

     of posting authority, prior to release. AFGSC Part B entries will not remain in FCIF
     Index longer than 1 year from date of issue. Post information no later than the posting
     date. OGV will reissue FCIFs upon expiration as applicable, unless specifically directed
     to remove the FCIF by HHQ. OGV may also rescind FCIFs through appropriate
     coordination with the posting authority.
        9.1.4.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3T will approve AFGSC-directed FCIF
        items for Part B after coordinating with HQ AFGSC/A3TV for AFGSC units, and
        HQ AFRC/A3V for AFRC units. OGV will maintain and post an FCIF AFGSC Form
        80 Index at the beginning of Part B/C Volume I. Label the title block, FCIF AFGSC
        Form 80 Index. Label the topic blocks, Index Number, Subject, Date Posted,

  NAF-published FCIF Index of Publications will list the current publishing date, any changes,
  and applicable FCIFs. Ensure changes to the published Index of Publications are easily
  identifiable (for example, highlighted). The unit’s basic index will reflect, at a minimum,
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                           79


   those instructions and technical orders that are listed in the FCIF Index of Publications.
   Units may add other publications at the discretion of unit Stan/Eval, but must maintain these
   publications with the most current versions available. Units will place the index in Part A of
   Volume I (Current Read File). Notification of publications or index of publications changes
   may be accomplished by HHQ release of a new FCIF Index of Publications. Units have five
   working days from notification to post the affected publication. Units will notify NAF
   Stan/Eval if a newer version of a publication is available and not listed on the FCIF Index of
   Publications.
      9.1.5.1. All publications in the library will be current and complete. MAJCOMs may
      authorize units to withhold posting of information that does not apply based on aircraft

EXCEPTIONALLY QUALIFIED: The examinee demonstrated exceptional aircraft handling
and instrument skills during all phases of this evaluation. Rapidly changing weather and denial
of service at two planned out-bases caused the examinee to have to change his plan several
times in-flight, each time done quickly and efficiently so that all aspects of the mission could
still be accomplished.

   Guard Liaison and HQ AFGSC/A3TV no later than 1 March and 1 September.
   A10.1.5. (AFGSC) Normally, MAJCOMs and NAFs will only conduct SAVs to ensure
   units have correctedproblem areas identified during previous evaluations . Units self-
   identifying a problem area will coordinate SAVs through NAF/CV for either a MAJCOM or
   NAF SAV. A SAV is conducted like a Stan/Eval visit. However, requesting units must
   identify specific areas, problems, or information to be covered during the SAV. SAVs will
   be NAF funded.
A10.2. (AFGSC) Formal visits are designed to:
   A10.2.1. (AFGSC) Determine the effectiveness of the Stan/Eval program and compliance
   with unit supplement to this publication.
   A10.2.2. (AFGSC) Assess the capability of the Chief of Stan/Eval, Flight Examiners,
   instructors and unit crewmembers to evaluate, instruct and perform the unit's DOC
   statement/operational taskings.
   A10.2.3. (AFGSC) Identify operational or training factors adversely affecting aircrew
   capability to accomplish the assigned mission and initiate corrective actions as required.
   A10.2.4. (AFGSC) Verify aircrew compliance with approved operational procedures.
   A10.2.5. (AFGSC) Provide meaningful feedback to commanders from a broad viewpoint as
   well as the specific evaluation of the existing evaluation criteria. The responsible NAF will
   evaluate unit operation during the entire period following the last formal visit, not just a
   “snapshot” of the unit’s current program status.
A10.3. (AFGSC) Notification Procedures:
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                          115


   A10.3.1. (AFGSC) The visit OPR will coordinate formal visitswith the AFGSC/IG
   Gatekeeper at least 60 days prior to the unit notification, and send a formal notification
   message/memorandum to the unit with an info copy to HQ AFGSC/IG and HQ
   AFGSC/A3TV 60 days before the visit. For AFRTC/ANG visits, the visit OPR will send
   notification to the units and HQ AFRC/A3V and 10AF/A3V or the State Adjutant General
   and NGB/A3O. The intent of this message/memorandum is to confirm the dates of the visit
   and inform the unit of the scope of the evaluation and support requirements. As a minimum,
   the message/memorandum will include the following:
       A10.3.1.1. (AFGSC) Approximate number of team members.
       A10.3.1.2. (AFGSC) Planned arrival date.
       A10.3.1.3. (AFGSC) Number and types of flight and Emergency Procedures
       (EP)/Aircrew Training Device (ATD) evaluations.
       A10.3.1.4. (AFGSC) Support required as necessary.
       A10.3.1.5. (AFGSC) Additional guidance on the selection of individuals and/or crews
       the team chief desires to evaluate--to include the Chief of Stan/Eval and/or Senior
       Examiners.
   A10.3.2. (AFGSC) Thirty days prior to the visit, a follow-up message/memorandum will
   include name, rank, security clearance, restricted area badge number, and aircraft specialty
   code of each team member.
A10.4. (AFGSC) Conduct of Visits:
   A10.4.1. (AFGSC) "Overall Unit Rating" is determined by combining the OGV and
   squadron ratings. The OGV rating is based on compliance with AFI 11-202V2 paragraph
   3.2. and AFGSC SUP and the performance of OGV and squadron-assigned flight examiners
   during objectivity evaluations administered by the HHQ team. Squadron ratings are based on
   compliance with AFI 11-202V2 paragraph 3.3. and AFGSC SUP and the performance of
   assigned/attached aircrews during flight and EP/ATD evaluations. In addition to the areas
   outlined in AFI 11-202V2 para 3.2. and 3.3., and AFGSC S
-Operations Supervision as outlined in AFI 11-418, Operations Supervision
-Technical Order maintenance/management as outlined in T.O. 00-5-1, Air Force Technical
Order System and AFI 11-215.
A10.4.1.1. The overall unit rating will not be higher than Satisfactory if the overall OGV
program rating is Unsatisfactory.

       A10.4.1.2. The overall OGV/squadron grade will not be higher than Satisfactory if any
       OGV/squadron program is rated Unsatisfactory.
   A10.4.2. Aircrew performance during evaluations will comprise 50 percent of squadron
   rating. Stan/Eval programs, procedures and compliance will comprise the other 50 percent.
   HHQ teams will comment on unit supervision and will identify Limiting Factors (LIMFACs)
   noted for higher headquarters action that adversely affect the unit's mission accomplishment.
   If appropriate, HHQ teams may comment on a distinct level of supervision within the unit.
   A10.4.3. Stan/Eval programs, to include Flight Examiners Objectivity Evaluations and
   OGV/SQ Operations Supervision will receive a 5-tier rating.

      A10.4.3.1. OUTSTANDING. Performance and procedures in effect were error-free and
      far exceeded all requirements. Program serves as a model which others should emulate.
      A10.4.3.2. EXCELLENT. Performance and                 procedures     in   effect    exceeded
      requirements and enhanced overall effectiveness.
      A10.4.3.3. SATISFACTORY. Performance            and/or    operations     met   mission
      requirements. Procedures and activities were carried out in an effective and competent
      manner. Resources and programs were efficiently managed. Minor deficiencies existed
      but do not impede or limit mission accomplishment.
      A10.4.3.4. MARGINAL. Most requirements were met, but not in full compliance with
      directives. Performance and the effectiveness of the program were degraded by
      deviations from procedures.
      A10.4.3.5. UNSATISFACTORY. Deviations or omissions caused the program(s)
      evaluated to be non-effective. Little compliance with appropriate directives was evident.
  A10.4.4. MAJCOM/NAF Flying-Related Special Interest Items (SIIs). SIIs are established
  by the MAJCOM/NAF to focus attention on operations related areas and will be evaluated
  during formal visits. Compliance will be reflected in all ratings and evaluations, and will be
  commented on separately in formal visit reports.
  A10.4.5. A representative sample (20 to 35 percent) of supervisors, instructors, and line
  (experienced and inexperienced) aircrews will be evaluated during the visit. Crewmembers
  maintaining multiple qualifications may be evaluated in either aircraft. All flight examiners
  may receive a Flight Examiner Objectivity Evaluation (flight or ground).
      A10.4.5.1. Individuals and/or crews identified to be evaluated in the notification
      messages will, to the maximum extent possible, have all evaluation requisites, except
      those directed by the evaluation team, completed prior to the formal visit to facilitate
      completion of AF Forms 8 prior to departure of the evaluation team.
      A10.4.5.2. Full notice evaluations are appropriate for those administered by unit Flight
      Examiners where a HHQ Flight Examiner will observe and administer a flight examiners
      Objectivity Evaluation. The full flight evaluation profile should be planned by the
      examinee. These evaluations will constitute an evaluation of the examinee (conducted by
      the unit flight examiners), as well as the unit flight examiners objectivity and the unit's
      flight evaluation profiles (conducted by the HHQ Flight Examiners ).
      A10.4.5.3. Flight examiners will administer no-notice evaluations to individuals by
      notifying the unit at an appropriate time (if the individual is already on the flying
      schedule) or by requesting that an individual be added to the next day's schedule for this
      purpose. HHQ Flight Examiners will communicate any additional or unique evaluation
      requirements beyond the scheduled mission profileto the examinee no later than 24 hours
      prior to the aircrew briefing to facilitate mission planning.
      A10.4.5.4. Flight evaluations/EPEs administered by HHQ Flight Examiners within 6
      months of a formal Stan/Eval visit may be counted toward the flight evaluation sample
      for that visit. If this option is exercised, all intermediate flight evaluations by HHQ Flight
      Examiners (including evaluation team designated augmentees) must count toward that
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_BARKSDALESUP_I 21 JANUARY 2014                                            117


         sample. The visit OPR must coordinate this with the unit CC and OG/CC prior to the 6
         month period.
   A10.4.6. In addition to aircrew flight evaluations, the evaluation team will administer all
   available CMR/BMC aircrew a 50 question closed book written examination and evaluate
   their flight publications. Flight publication checks will include all issued flight
   manuals/T.O.s, checklists, and OGV issued aircrew aids.
         A10.4.6.1. The written examination will consist of 50 questions from the specific MDS
         MQF. The evaluation team may substitute 10% of questions with non-MQF questions
         developed by the evaluation team. These questions, if used, will reflect local procedures,
         FCIFs, and SIIs. If non-MQF questions are used, specific topics will be identified in the
         60-day message.
            A10.4.6.1.1. At OG/CC discretion, the 50 question written examination administered
            during a Stan/Eval formal evaluation may fulfill either the requisite closed-book
            examination requirement, if it meets all the appropriate criteria, or the semi-annual
            test requirement.
         A10.4.6.2. The minimum passing grade for the written examination is 85%.
