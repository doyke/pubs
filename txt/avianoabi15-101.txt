1. General.
     1.1. The 31 OSS/OSW provides/arranges weather services to support the peacetime and
     wartime mission of the 31 FW and other associate units at Aviano AB. 31 OSS/OSW is the
     lead weather unit (LWU) for all weather services and issues at Aviano AB. This instruction
     establishes requirements and outlines duties and responsibilities of 31 OSS/OSW and
     establishes reciprocal support requirements with other base agencies.
     1.2. Implementation. This instruction covers daily operations including exercise and
     contingency operations. Unless superseded by Emergency War Orders, this instruction is
     followed during wartime operations.
     1.3. Concept of Operations. IAW AFI 15-128 and AFMAN 15-129V1/V2, as the single point of
     contact for USAF weather information at Aviano AB, 31 OSS/OSW, as the Exploitation Unit
     (EU), tailors operational and strategic level weather products for the operational user and
     provides decision-grade information on weather and environmental impacts to military
     operations. 31 OSS/OSW leverages support from the Characterization Unit (CU), 21st OWS at
     Kapaun AS, Germany for 24-hour forecasting services, meteorological watch, and resource
     protection services. Changes to this instruction affecting 21 OWS provided services are
     coordinated with 21 OWS and 31 OSS/OSW. The installation data page located at
     https://ows.sembach.af.mil/Tailored_Met/index.cfm?fuseaction=showunit&UID=&BW=H
     &UF=M&AOR=1&unit=126 under ―21 OWS Uploaded Documents/Datasheet‖ details the
     agreement between the EU and CU with regards to responsibilities.
     1.4. Duty Priorities. The duty priorities of 31 OSS/OSW and the 21 OWS are outlined in
     Table 1 and Table 2 Expeditionary Duty priorities are listed in Table 7 The duty priority
     tables exist to match and balance limited manning and mission critical tasks. Duty priorities
     focus efforts during peak work periods prone to task saturation and priority conflicts. These
     duty priorities were developed IAW AFMAN 15-129 V2. Weather operators use good
     judgment in complying with these duty priorities, especially where there is imminent danger
     to life and/or property.

             bulletins, AFN support, etc.)
12           Accomplish recurring training
13           Accomplish administrative tasks

     1.5. Assumption of Duties. IAW AFMAN 15-129 V1, in the event that the 21 OWS is
     unable to fulfill its primary duties (issue TAF, watches, warnings, advisories, etc.) for Aviano
     AB due to evacuation or equipment failure, 31 OSS/OSW assumes 21 OWS resource
     protection duties for Aviano AB until the 21 OWS is able to resume duties. If the 21 OWS is
     non-operational for more than 72 hours, the 21 OWS deploys forecasters to the 31 OSS/OSW
     to assist in the assumption of their duties and extended hours of operations. Similarly, if 31
     OSS/OSW is unable to perform primary duties, the 21 OWS assumes 31 OSS/OSW duties as
     ability and distance permit, until 31 OSS/OSW is ready to resume duties. The agency
     surrendering duties is responsible for contacting the other agency and the Aviano Command
     Post (31 FW/CP).
     1.6. Emergency Evacuation to Alternate Operating Location. In the event of an evacuation
     of the primary operating facility, bldg. 904, 31 OSS/OSW moves operations to the Alternate
     Operating Location (AOL), located at bldg 1133. Once established at the AOL, 31
     OSS/OSW continues to provide limited observing and resource protection services. Other
     services may be degraded as noted below.
        1.6.1. The limitations of support are highly dependent upon the operational status of 31
        OSS/OSW’s primary sensor suite, the FMQ-19, and the primary means of dissemination,
        the JET located in building 1442.
        1.6.2. If JET/FMQ-19 are operational, all support is provided as in normal operations
        with the exception of the following limitations:
            1.6.2.1. MEFs are provided as normal to local customers only. All transient aircrews
            must contact 21 OWS for weather briefing services.
            1.6.2.2. Limited radar capabilities available via the Internet.
            1.6.2.3. No PMSV. PMSV will be monitored by ATC.
        1.6.3. If JET/FMQ-19 are not operational, all of the above limitations are incurred with
        the addition of the following:
            1.6.3.1. Surface observations contain all standard parameters with pressure and wind
            values marked as estimated.
            1.6.3.2. Local dissemination of forecasts, observations, warnings, watches, and
            advisories are limited to voice dissemination to agencies listed in Table 3
     1.7. Operating Assumptions.      The 31 OSS/OSW assumes adequate resources,
     communications, personnel and facilities are available to execute all base weather support.
     Additionally, 31 OSS/OSW assumes all communication equipment functions continuously.
 6                                                  AVIANOABI15-101 26 DECEMBER 2012


     1.8. Release of Weather Data to Non-DoD Agencies and Individuals. No data is released to
     non-DoD agencies or personnel without the express approval of 31 FW Public Affairs (31
     FW/PA) and 31 FW Staff Judge Advocate (31 FW/JA) Legal offices.
     1.9. Coordination between 31OSS/OSW and ITAF. Responsibility and interaction between
     ITAF WX flight and 31 OSS/OSW is in accordance with the LOA between Comandante
     Aeroporto Pagliano E Gori and the 31st Fighter Wing Commander dated 13 November 2001
     as well as the LOA for USAF Runway Visual Range (RVR) and Wind Sensor Use and
     Procedures dated 31 May 2011.
     1.10. Additional Weather Support. All requests for additional weather support must be
     directed to 31 OSS/OSW Flight CC or Wing Weather Officer (WWO). If the Flight CC and
     Wing Weather Officer are unavailable, additional weather support can be coordinated with
     the Flight Chief. The 31 OSS/OSW Flight CC and Wing Weather Officer arrange or direct
     services IAW AFMAN 15-129 V2, USAFE and Air Force instructions, manuals, and
     directives.
2. Weather Team Operations
     2.1. 31 OSS/OSW Responsibilities. The 31 OSS/OSW Flight CC, WWO and/or Flight
     Chief directs or arranges for all weather support and services to the USAF at Aviano AB.
     2.2. Hours of Operation.
        2.2.1. 31 OSS/OSW operating hours are dictated by 31 FW flying hours and support for
        24/7 contingency operations.
            2.2.1.1. The Airfield Services Element (ASE) is open one hour prior to local flying
            until the termination of local flying. Outside of local flying hours the ASE opens
            upon request of the 31 OG/CC or designated representative. The ASE provides
            support to the SOF, flight weather briefings services, meteorological watch, staff
            weather services, climate data, and PMSV. The ASE supplements/backs-up
            automated observations and augments 21 OWS as its ―eyes forward‖ in performing
            TAF and resource protection duties. ASE is in place 24/7 in support of contingency
            operations when directed by 31 FW/CC.
            2.2.1.2. The Mission Services Element (MSE) arrives at a minimum of 1 hour before
            first brief time at their squadron and stays until feedback has been collected from the
            last go (EXCEPTION: If manning is limited, MSE forecasters may depart after
            briefings are completed and feedback is collected the next day or by ASE). When
            departing, MSE forecasters checks with the Top 3 and coordinates METWATCH
            responsibilities with the ASE (If manning is critical, briefs are saved on wing drive
            and verbally given over the phone to the Top3 or face to face at building 904 weather
            counter.) The MSE provides MEFs, flight weather briefing services, mission watch,
            staff weather services, and climate data to their squadrons. In the circumstance that a
            fighter squadron does not have adequate room and equipment to support a weather
            forecaster, the MSE forecaster is located in building 904 and briefs are saved on wing
            drive and verbally given over the phone to the Top3 or face to face at building 904
            weather counter.
AVIANOABI15-101 26 DECEMBER 2012                                                            7


     2.2.2. During hours of 31 OSS/OSW closure, 21 OWS provides METWATCH and
     resource protection services for Aviano AB. 31 OSS/OSW maintains a standby
     forecaster at all times to be recalled for duty under circumstances outlined in Paragraph
     2.3 Upon closure, the closing forecaster notifies the 31 FW/CP and 21 OWS to inform
     those agencies of a transfer of responsibility. Upon opening, the forecaster calls the
     above agencies to reclaim responsibility.
     2.2.3. In the event that weather criteria listed in 2.3.2.1, and 2.3.2.2 is valid at the
     scheduled time of office closure, 31 OSS/OSW remains open until the weather threat has
     passed.
  2.3. Standby Forecaster Recall.
     2.3.1. During office closure, 31 OSS/OSW maintains a standby forecaster at all times.
     Upon recall, the standby forecaster reports to bldg 904. The forecaster immediately
     notifies the 21 OWS and the 31 FW/CP upon arrival and begins weather duties.
     2.3.2. The 21 OWS recalls the standby forecaster when the following criteria occur:
         2.3.2.1. 21 OWS issues a weather watch or warning as defined in Table 9 or Table
         10 (EXCEPTION: The standby forecaster is not required to return for a heavy rain
         watch/warning unless the automated rain gauge is broken or for a lightning
         watch/warning outside airfield operating hours) and the phenomena is expected to
         occur within the next two hours.
         2.3.2.2. When ATC is open and the automated observing system is inoperable.
  2.4. Transient Aircrew Services.
     2.4.1. During normal operating hours, transient aircrews may receive flight weather
     briefings from 31 OSS/OSW according to the standard duty priorities outlined in

        lightning in the vicinity of Aviano. The instruments are located at the primary
        touchdown points of both runway (RWY) 05 and 23 and are centered between the RWY
        and taxiway Bravo. RWY 05 contains a complete set of all instruments, while RWY 23
        has sensors for wind, cloud heights, visibility, and RVR only. Displays for the equipment
        are located at 31 OSS/OSW and at the ITAF weather office. 31 CS is responsible for
        routine maintenance and repair of the FMQ-19.
        2.5.2. AN/TMS-2 Portable Doppler Radar (PDR). This is the primary weather radar at
        Aviano AB. The antenna dish is located near bldg 7250, while the display is located in
        bldg 904. The PDR shows precipitation and thunderstorm reflectivity/velocity signatures
        in the vicinity of Aviano AB. Due to the antenna’s close proximity to the mountains, the
        PDR cannot see echoes greater than 10 nm away from the W to the NE. 31 CS is
        responsible for routine maintenance and repair of the PDR.
     2.6. Communications Equipment.
        2.6.1. JET. JET is Air Force Weather’s primary communications system. It uses a
        centralized server and desktop computers to transmit data to and receive data from
        weather agencies worldwide via the internet and dedicated communications link. 31
        OSS/OSW and 21 OWS use JET locally to disseminate observations, forecasts,
        advisories, watches, and warnings to Aviano AB via the Aviano and 21 OWS LAN.
           2.6.1.1. If JET malfunctions in any office on base, that office should immediately
           inform 31 OSS/OSW to check for troubleshooting instructions. Any repairs that
           cannot be performed by 31 OSS/OSW are referred to the AFWA or JET Help Desk
           and tracked by 31 OSS/OSW. JET is maintained through the JET Project
           Management Office with the contract monitored by AFWA. A Military Operating
           Area (MOA) dated 26 October 2009 between 24th Air Force and the Air Force
           Weather Agency outlines the roles and responsibilities for maintaining the JET
           system at Aviano.
           2.6.1.2. In the event of a JET outage, 31 OSS/OSW disseminates watches, warnings, and
           advisories by phone notification to only the agencies shown in Table 3 In addition all
           weather observations are uploaded via https://weather.af.mil/AFW_WEBs for long line
           availability.

        2.6.2. PMSV. 31 OSS/OSW is assigned frequency 257.75 MHz for PMSV.                   See
        Paragraph 4.5 for more information on PMSV.
        2.6.3. Local Area Network (LAN). The Aviano LAN is vital for 31 OSS/OSW
        operations because data relayed to and from other weather centers is passed via the LAN.
        Real-time information available over the Internet and Intranet is used in briefing and
AVIANOABI15-101 26 DECEMBER 2012                                                              9


      forecasting. In the event of LAN failure, all services are significantly degraded. Since
      JET depends on the LAN for dissemination of local advisories/watches/warnings,
      resource protection is degraded during a LAN failure.
      2.6.4. Telephone. 31 OSS/OSW has 2 multi-line VOIP phones and 1 single line non-
      VOIP landline phone in the operations area which are used to relay information. After
      advisories, watches, and warnings are issued, 31 OSS/OSW courtesy calls the critical
      agencies listed in Table 4 to ensure the messages have been received.

      Commercial prefix is 0434-30. Last four digits remain the same. During 31 FW EOC
      activation, all watches, warnings, and advisories that were passed to the Command Post,
      are passed to the Command Post thru the OSS EOC representative. The EOC
      representative briefs the 31 FW/CC and 31 OG/CC or designated representatives on the
      pending watch, warning, and advisory and the impact this could have to emergency
      operations. The EOC representative then notifies Command Post for base wide
      dissemination according to Figure A4.1

   2.7. 31 OSS/OSW Tailored Web Page. 31 OSS/OSW maintains an operational tailored web
   page on the 21 OWS Web Page. OWS 5-Day Forecasts for Aviano are published on the 21
   OWS Tailored Web Page daily. In addition, real-time airfield weather sensor information
   can be seen. Other products are posted and maintained as applicable.
   2.8. Bldg 904 Power. 31st Civil Engineer Squadron (31 CES) is the point of contact for
   power issues in bldg 904. Critical weather systems used operationally for resource protection
   are backed-up via generator, frequency converter and UPS in the event of main power

   failure. User is responsible for the operation and maintenance of UPS and frequency
   converter.
   2.9. 31 OSS/OSW Limitations.
      2.9.1. The official point of observation, located in the grassy area next to Hangar 1, does
      not allow a clear, unobstructed 360 degree view of the airfield. The observer’s view is
      obstructed from west to the northwest by Hangar 1 and from the northwest to the
      northeast by nearby buildings. The view is further obstructed from the east to the south
      by nearby buildings. Mountains from the west to the northeast of the airfield prevent the
      observer from seeing phenomena greater than 10nm from Aviano AB in that direction.
          2.9.1.1. 31 OSS/OSW has coordinated a cooperative weather watch (CWW) with 31
          OSS/OSAT in the Aviano tower and is reliant on visibility data passed from the tower
          to construct representative weather services. (See Paragraph 5.6 for details on
          CWW.)
          2.9.1.2. High intensity security lights located on nearby buildings hinder the
          technician’s ability to determine sky condition and visibility at night.
          2.9.1.3. Instantaneous observations from the weather station are not possible because
          the observer must walk approximately 100 meters to view the airfield complex.
      2.9.2. Equipment or sensors for measuring clouds, wind, temperature, RVR, visibility
      and dew point are located near the approach end of RWY 05. Cloud, wind sensors,
      visibility and RVR are the only instruments for RWY 23.
      2.9.3. Optimum forecast and observing support is dependent on fully operational
      communication and meteorological sensing equipment.
      2.9.4. Distance of lightning is determined using a combination of visual observations,
      flash-to-bang technique, lightning detection system and radar observations.
      2.9.5. Certain services, such as instrument refresher course (IRC) briefings, verification
      briefings, wing quarterly safety briefings and CWW training may not be available
      without prior coordination depending on manning levels or duty priorities. One week
      minimum prior notice is desired.
      2.9.6. Some services are degraded during and after relocation to the AOL (see
      Paragraph 1.6)

4. Mission Services
    4.1. General. Mission services are actions taken by 31 OSS/OSW directly relating to the
    mission of the customer. The MEF is the primary tool used to accomplish these tasks, and is
    tailored to individual customer requirements. 31 OSS/OSW provides all local mission
    services during wing flying operations. Transient mission services are handled as detailed in
    Paragraph 2.4
    4.2. A MEF is developed using the MEF Process outlined in AFMAN 15-129 V2 Table 2.1
    and 2.2. During this process, 31 OSS/OSW personnel create the MEF by fusing and tailoring
    products created by strategic and regional weather centers, as well as information supplied by
    local units and agencies. The end result is a product designed to provide timely, accurate and
    relevant weather information to customers. MEFs must be horizontally consistent with (but
    not necessarily mirror) products issued by 21 OWS and AFWA unless coordinated with 21
    OWS. During rapidly changing conditions, 31 OSS/OSW amends the MEF to reflect
    accurate conditions and brief the customer, and then back-briefs 21 OWS as time permits.
          4.2.1. General. The MEF is tailored to fit the daily mission needs of the 510 FS and 555
          FS and any contingency units as required. At a minimum, this product includes the
14                                                AVIANOABI15-101 26 DECEMBER 2012


     forecast weather conditions at Aviano AB (takeoff and recovery); forecasted weather at
     all scheduled MOA to include winds, hazards, space weather data, and cloud/visibility
     forecasts. Additional information such as target acquisition data, illumination data for
     night vision goggles, low-level route forecasts, aerial refueling track forecasts, sea state,
     and sea temperatures are provided as mission requirements dictate. The MEF is
     considered a legal flight weather briefing for local flying. The format of the MEF is
     flexible and changes as necessary to meet the needs of each customer. An example of a
     MEF is found in Attachment 8.
     4.2.2. MEF Publishing. 31 OSS/OSW briefs the MEF during mass/over-the-shoulder
     briefings at the 510 and 555 FS facilities, respectively. If no mass brief is scheduled,
     then 31 OSS/OSW forecasters brief face-to-face at the weather desk located in the
     corresponding fighter squadron. Under low-manned conditions or by request of FS under
     the conditions of not having enough space and equipment for an embedded forecaster,
     MEF is saved on wing network drive and briefed to Top3 over the phone with any/all
     questions being answered.
         4.2.2.1. The MEF is posted no later than 30 minutes before the initial briefing. The
         MEF is posted in a location requested by the Top 3 on the Wing Network drive. The
         MEF is not produced on days when no local flying is scheduled.
         4.2.2.2. In the event of network failure, 31 OSS/OSW e-mails MEFs to each
         customer’s duty desks if requested. If e-mail is unavailable, fax or hand delivery is
         used.
  4.3. Aviano 5-Day Outlook.
     4.3.1. General. The 5-Day is a forecast product geared for non-aviation support and is
     produced by the 21 OWS. It is tailored to fit the daily needs of the 31 FW’s flight line
     support, other ground based activities and the local Aviano community. The 5-Day is
     provided as a planning tool and should not be used to make operational decisions without
     first consulting 31 OSS/OSW.
     4.3.2. 5-Day Publishing. The 21 OWS publishes the 5-Day daily NLT 0600L.
         4.3.2.1. All customers may access the 5-Day via the 31 OSS/OSW tailored webpage
         on the 21 OWS webpage (see Paragraph 2.7).
         4.3.2.2. In the event of web page failure, 31 OSS/OSW emails the 5-Day to each
         customer as requested if they are able to access it via email.
     4.3.3. 5-Day Amendments. The 21 OWS amends the 5-Day as time and mission
     priorities allow if it is unrepresentative of the current or forecasted conditions at Aviano
     AB.
  4.4. Flight Weather Briefings. 31 OSS/OSW provides Flight Weather Briefings to all
  Aviano AB crews as duty priorities permit. Transient aircrews receive flight weather
  briefings only during hours of operation (See Paragraph 2.4 for more detail). If leaving the
  local area, aircrew should request briefings at least two hours in advance to give weather
  personnel time to fully analyze weather data and make accurate forecasts. Flight weather
  briefings can be placed on request by calling the weather flight at 632-7628, or 632-7629, or
AVIANOABI15-101 26 DECEMBER 2012                                                             15


   commercial 0434-30-7628/7629. In the event the 31 OSS/OSW is not on duty, instructions
   on contacting the 21 OWS to obtain a weather brief are posted next to the weather counter.
   4.5. PMSV. 31 OSS/OSW provides weather observations and forecasts to all aircrew that
   contact Aviano AB, regardless of that aircraft’s home station. Aviano’s assigned PMSV
   frequency is 257.75 MHz. 31 OSS/OSW also solicits PIREPs during each PMSV contact
   with aircrew. PIREPs help 31 OSS/OSW better serve pilots and enhance flight safety. Long
   term outages are annotated via NOTAM until repaired.
   4.6. MISSIONWATCH. MISSIONWATCH is the process by which 31 OSS/OSW
   monitors the weather for all local missions. Combined with METWATCH (see Paragraph
   5.7), MISSIONWATCH allows 31 OSS/OSW to monitor operations at and around Aviano
   AB and issue changes/amendments to any MEF. During rapidly changing conditions or if
   the MEF is inaccurate, 31 OSS/OSW amends the MEF (if prior to aircrew step) to ensure the
   forecast accurately reflects current/expected conditions and contacts the SOF or Top 3 to
   pass on mission impacts.
   4.7. Space Weather. 31 OSS/OSW briefs space weather events during the MEF, focusing on
   impacts to communications.
   4.8. Post-Flight Feedback. The MSE remains in the FS for the duration of the flying
   window, if manning and space allows. The MSE solicit feedback from pilots upon their
   return or requests that the Top3 contacts 31 OSS/OSW at building 904 (via x7628/7629) if
   they cannot be present upon return. Under low-manned conditions, MSE contacts the Top 3
   or pilots via phone for feedback after each mission if feedback was not already provided.
5. Airfield Services
   5.1. General. Airfield services are weather actions affecting the Aviano AB aerodrome or
   base as a whole. Examples include weather observations, PMSV and resource protection.
   5.2. Observations. Observations are taken, recorded, and disseminated IAW AFMAN 15-
   111. All the observations are reported using the automated sensor that is augmented through
   either supplementing or back-up. Supplementing is a method of manually adding
   meteorological information to an automated observation that is beyond the capabilities of the
   AMOS to detect and/or report. Back-up is the method of manually providing meteorological
   data and/or dissemination to an AMOS observation when the primary automated method is
   not operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure. There are two
   types of observations: METAR (Routine Meteorological Observation Report) and SPECI
   (Special Observation). Typical information found in observations includes: date/time,
   winds, visibility, RVR, present weather, cloud cover, temperature, dew-point, and altimeter
   setting. The official observing point is located in the grassy area near taxiway alpha, near
   Hangar 1. There are some limitations to this site, see Paragraph 2.9 for further explanation.
   31 OSS/OSW disseminates observations locally and long-line using JET. In the event of JET
   malfunction, 31 OSS/OSW disseminates the observation locally as described in Paragraph
   2.6.1.2
       5.2.1. Aviano AB has two weather observations. One observation is disseminated by the
       ITAF weather office under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
       identifier LIPA. The other observation is disseminated by 31 OSS/OSW under the ICAO
       identifier LIYW.
 16                                                AVIANOABI15-101 26 DECEMBER 2012


           5.2.1.1. The ITAF weather observation, LIPA, is the official weather observation for
           Aviano AB. It is used to determine airfield open/closure status and Instrument Flight
           Rules/Visual Flight Rules (IFR/VFR) pattern status, and is broadcasted by ATC. The
           LIPA observation is available during all airfield open hours.
           5.2.1.2. The USAF Weather observation, LIYW, is used as supplemental information
           to the LIPA observation. This information is used to determine 31 FW divert status,
           VFR pattern usability, mission execution, emergency conditions, and is utilized
           during rapid weather changes. The LIYW observation is available 24 hours.
       5.2.2. Types of Observations
           5.2.2.1. METAR observations are taken and disseminated every hour between 55 and
           59 minutes after the hour. METAR observations can include SPECI criteria (see
           Attachment 2 for SPECI criteria). METAR observations are disseminated both
           locally and long-line.
           5.2.2.2. SPECI observations are taken when certain criteria as show in Attachment
           2, are met at Aviano AB. SPECI observations can be sent at any time and are
           disseminated locally and long-line.
       5.2.3. Observation code and format
           5.2.3.1. _CCCC_YYGGggZ_COR or AUTO_dddff(f)Gfmfm

  5.3. TAF.
     5.3.1. Aviano AB TAFs are produced and disseminated by 21 OWS. For TAF format
     and amendment criteria, see Attachment 3. The TAF is issued at 0300Z, 1100Z, and
     1900Z, when required by wing flying.
     5.3.2. The 21 OWS disseminates the TAF locally and long-line using JET. In the event
     of loss of connectivity between the 21 OWS and Aviano AB, the 21 OWS contacts 31
     OSS/OSW, who in turn disseminates the TAF. In the event of a complete JET failure, 31
     OSS/OSW contacts 21 OWS, obtains the TAF and emails, faxes, or calls the agencies in
     Table 3
     5.3.3. 21 OWS amends the TAF as described in Attachment 3, and for all
     watch/warning conditions.
     5.3.4. During periods when 31 OSS/OSW is closed, 21 OWS does not issue or amend
     the TAF. This is noted with the remark ―LAST NO AMDS AFT DDHH NEXT DDHH.‖
  5.4. Watches, Warnings, and Advisories. 21 OWS and 31 OSS/OSW perform resource
  protection for Aviano AB. Resource protection is detailed in Chapter 7.
  5.5. Basic Weather Watch (BWW.) 31 OSS/OSW conducts a BWW during duty hours as
  required. A BWW is a process to monitor changing weather conditions. Outside of taking
  METAR and SPECI observations, weather personnel monitor weather conditions and
  recheck the weather at least every 20 minutes. During BWW, if only one forecaster is
  working ASE, he/she takes a cell phone with them during the observation. This phone
  number is provided to the SOF/TOP3s.
  5.6. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW.) 31 OSS/OSW maintains a CWW program with
  ATC. The 31 OSS/OSW flight provides and documents limited observer training for ATC
  personnel. As ATC personnel provide weather input, 31 OSS/OSW re-evaluates the weather
  for observation changes.
     5.6.1. ATC and SOF personnel notify the weather flight within five minutes via hotline
     when any of the following are seen or occur on Aviano AB:
        5.6.1.1. Significant visibility changes that reduce below or rise above 6000 meters.
        5.6.1.2. Precipitation begins or ends.
        5.6.1.3. Thunderstorms or lightning.
        5.6.1.4. Hail of any size begins/ends or changes size/intensity.
        5.6.1.5. Tornado or funnel cloud.
        5.6.1.6. Any other significant meteorological condition.
     5.6.2. ATC and SOF personnel also pass to 31 OSS/OSW any PIREPs received within
     five minutes.
  5.7. METWATCH. A METWATCH is used to provide an organized approach for weather
  personnel to maintain situational awareness of both current and future meteorological
  situations. 21 OWS performs a continuous METWATCH for Aviano AB, with 31
 18                                              AVIANOABI15-101 26 DECEMBER 2012


   OSS/OSW providing ―eyes forward‖ support. Changes in the status of weather elements
   result in notification from 31 OSS/OSW or 21 OWS to base agencies.
      5.7.1. The METWATCH process encompasses:
          5.7.1.1. Weather watch and warning criteria (Tables 7.1 and 7.2)
          5.7.1.2. Weather advisory criteria (Tables 7.3 and 7.4)
          5.7.1.3. SPECI observation criteria (see Attachment 2)
          5.7.1.4. Defined air and ground mission-limiting parameters (Table 3.1)
   5.8. Bioenvironmental Information. The only bioenvironmental information 31 OSS/OSW
   provides is the Fighter Index of Thermal Stress (FITS) condition IAW AFI 11-418,
   Operations Supervision and AFPAM 48-151, Thermal Injury. The FITS condition is passed
   to the SOF and TOP 3.
6. Staff Weather Support
   6.1. General. The 31 OSS/OSW WWO (or Flight CC when a WWO is not appointed)
   directly handles staff support. Staff weather support includes, but is not limited to, staff
   weather briefings, IRC briefings, mass deployment briefings, assisting in the planning and
   execution of exercises, and participation in the EOC/ Mission Planning Cell (MPC). The
   WWO may delegate duties to any qualified personnel within the flight. Staff weather
   services are built to be flexible and are tailored to meet the needs of the customer.
   6.2. 31 FW Staff Weather Support. 31 OSS/OSW provides weather information to 31 FW
   senior staff as requested. 31 OSS/OSW tailors each briefing to the needs of the audience.
   6.3. 31 FW EOC. 31 OSS/OSW is a member of 31 FW EOC. While present, 31 OSS/OSW
   provides the EOC Mission Director and 31 FW Senior Leadership current and forecast
   weather data for Aviano and other pertinent locations. During EOC activation, all watches,
   warnings, and advisories are passed to the CP thru the EOC representative. The EOC
   representative briefs the 31 OG/CC or designated representative of the pending watch,
   warning or advisory and the impacts to the emergency operations. The EOC representative
   then notifies the CP for base wide dissemination according to Figure A4.1
   6.4. Tropical Weather Updates. 31 OSS/OSW provides briefings to the 31 FW/CC and the
   wing staff when a tropical system is expected to impact operations in the 31 FW mission
   areas or impact a 31 FW operation in another region. The Weather Flight leadership uses the
   chain of command to pass this information to the 31 FW/CC. 31 OSS/OSW works with the
   21 OWS who performs the METWATCH and serves as the primary liaison between the
   tropical centers and 31 OSS/OSW. 31 OSS/OSW uses the tropical cyclone forecast issued
   by the designated tropical cyclone centers (National Hurricane Center or Joint Typhoon
   Warning Center). 31 OSS/OSW does not deviate from the official forecast position, track,
   movement, maximum wind speed, or intensity trend and does not deviate from the CU
   forecast. The MSE tailors the official tropical cyclone forecast into a specific mission
   forecast product. 31 OSS/OSW ensures that the commander understands that the 48-hour
   and 72-hour outlooks contain a high degree of uncertainty, are for planning purposes only,
   and are subject to change. 31 OSS/OSW includes the forecast error probability statements
   included in the discussion bulletins or on the forecast product. Release of tropical cyclone

   forecasts to the general public follows the guidance in this document (1.8 Release of Weather
   Data to Non-DoD Agencies and Individuals).
   6.5. Mass Deployment/Concept Briefings. 31 OSS/OSW provides a mass weather briefing in
   the event of any mass deployment of personnel or aircraft from Aviano AB. Briefing format
   depends upon the mission. Three hours advance notice is requested for mass briefings to be
   prepared properly.
   6.6. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) - Verification Briefings. 31 OSS/OSW briefs the
   weather portion of all local IRC/Verification briefings. The IRC briefing covers 31 OSS/OSW
   services, seasonal climatology, flight hazards, and relations/differences between USAF and ITAF
   weather operations. Verification briefings are tailored to the specific mission scenario. 31
   OSS/OSW requests 1 week advance notification to prepare a proper briefing.
   6.7. Exercise Planning and Input. 31 OSS/OSW is part of the Aviano Exercise and
   Evaluation Team (EET) and participates in planning exercises and evaluating weather
   support provided. 31 OSS/OSW provides real and/or exercise weather data for exercise
   scenarios. The 31 OSS/OSW coordinates exercise support with the 21 OWS as required.
   6.8. Climatology Support. 31 OSS/OSW tracks climate statistics at Aviano AB and passes
   climatology data to base agencies as requested. Data not maintained by 31 OSS/OSW, is
   retrieved from the 14th Weather Squadron by 31 OSS/OSW. 31 OSS/OSW requests 2 week
   advance notification for climatology briefings.
7. Resource Protection
   7.1. General. This section details actions undertaken by 31 OSS/OSW to provide resource
   protection to Aviano AB. Resource protection is accomplished jointly by 31 OSS/OSW and
   21 OWS through the use of weather advisories, weather watches, and weather warnings. All
   watches, warnings and advisories are valid for a 5nm radius from Aviano AB (except
   thunderstorms within 10nm). The center point for these is defined as the center of Area F.
   7.2. Delineation of Duties. 21 OWS is responsible for issuing forecast advisories, watches
   and warnings, while the 31 OSS/OSW acts as the ―eyes forward‖ for the 21 OWS. In the
   event of imminent threat to life and/or property requiring an urgent dissemination, 31
   OSS/OSW issues warnings normally issued by 21 OWS. In these cases, 31 OSS/OSW
   informs 21 OWS as time permits.
   7.3. Unit Requirements. Each unit at Aviano AB is responsible for coordinating additional
   watch/warning/advisory support or special notification for existing watches/
   warnings/advisories with 31 OSS/OSW. Also, each customer requesting support must
   validate the requirement by providing 31 OSS/OSW with a list of protective actions taken
   each time the special notification is given or unique watch/warning/advisory is made. These
   are listed in Attachment 5. If the request falls within the operational capabilities of 31
   OSS/OSW or 21 OWS, then weather personnel monitors, advises, watches and warns of such
   significant weather formations.
   7.4. Weather Watches. A weather watch alerts Aviano AB units to the potential of weather
   conditions that may threaten life and/or property. When a weather watch is issued, all units
   on Aviano AB should prepare to take protective actions, in the event the weather watch is
   upgraded to warning status. See Attachment 4 for a sample watch format. Table 9 contains
   weather watches and desired lead times for Aviano AB:

NOTE: ** 31 OSS/OSW notifies CE when these conditions are forecasted or significant changes to the
forecast occur.

   7.5. Forecast Weather Warnings. A weather warning alerts Aviano AB units to an imminent
   or in-progress weather event that could pose a hazard to life and/or property. When a
   weather warning (WW) is issued, all units on Aviano AB should take protective actions
   immediately. Table 10 contains weather warnings and desired lead times for Aviano AB.
   See Attachment 4 for sample warning format.
   7.6. Observed Weather Warnings. An observed weather warning is issued for lightning
   within 5 nm of Aviano AB. Observed warnings are issued by 31 OSS/OSW when the
   condition is first observed and are annotated with a valid time of until further notice.
   Observed warnings are cancelled 15 minutes after last observed occurrence. See
   Attachment 4 for sample warning format.

Table 10. Forecast Weather Warning Criteria for Aviano AB.
CRITERIA                                                                   DLT

   7.7. Weather Advisories.
      7.7.1. Observed Advisories. Weather advisories are weather information bulletins to
      alert base units to specific mission-impacting criteria not defined as watch or warning
      criteria. 21 OWS issues observed advisories as shown in Table 11 31 OSS/OSW issues
      observed weather advisories. 31 OSS/OSW leverages observations, PIREPs, radar, and
      all other resources to determine if any criteria meeting an observed advisory are
      occurring. Upon initial occurrence, the 31 OSS/OSW forecaster issues the advisory with
      a valid time of until further notice. Once issued, observed advisories are canceled when
      the forecaster can reasonably determine that atmospheric conditions no longer support
      reoccurrence. Sample advisory format is found in Attachment 4.

Table 11. Observed Weather Advisories Criteria for Aviano AB.
CRITERIA                                                                   VALID
Low Level Wind Shear: non-convective (Requires subjective verification)    Until Further Notice

Crosswind >20 KTS                                                          Until Further Notice
Crosswind >25 KTS                                                          Until Further Notice
Induction Icing Conditions                                                 Until Further Notice
Visibility < 400m                                                          Until Further Notice

      7.7.2. Forecast Advisories. 21 OWS issues forecast advisories for Aviano AB when the
      following criteria in Table 12 are expected to occur:

Table 12. Forecast Weather Advisory Criteria for Aviano AB.
CRITERIA                                                                       DLT
Winds > 25kts but < 35kts (Maximum gust is specified in warning)               1 Hour
Snow Accumulation > Trace Snow but <2 inches in 12 hrs**                       2 Hours
NOTE: ** 31 OSS/OSW notifies CE when these conditions are forecasted or significant changes to the
forecast occur.

   7.8. Base Dissemination. Dissemination of watches, warnings, extensions, and cancellations
   is done via the JET system (See Paragraph 2.6.1) 31 OSS/OSW confirms receipt through a
   phone call to ATC, 31 FW/CP, MOC and Airfield Management. (See Table 4) See
   Attachment 4 for more information on dissemination.
   7.9. Operational Reports (OPREP). IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, and AFI 10-
   229, Responding to Severe Weather Events, 31 OSS/OSW provides the 31 FW/CP with
   weather information needed to report impacts of severe weather to higher headquarters. If
   damage occurs the Command Post determines the requirement to initiate an OPREP-3
   Report. 31 OSS/OSW must contact the 31 FW/CP if any of the following criteria are met.
      7.9.1. Tornado
22                                              AVIANOABI15-101 26 DECEMBER 2012


     7.9.2. Winds > 50kts (to include gusts)
     7.9.3. Hail > ¾ inch
     7.9.4. Lightning strike with damage
     7.9.5. Snowstorm (2 inches of snow accumulation within 12 hrs)
     7.9.6. At conclusion of the severe weather, 31 OSS/OSW reviews and summarizes the
     severe weather, then forwards information to the 31 FW/CP, 21 OWS, and USAFE/A3W.
     Within 24 hours of the severe weather occurrence, 31 OSS/OSW leadership provides or
     arranges delivery of hard copies of relevant forecasts, observations, watches, warnings,
     and equipment status to the 31 FW/CP, to be included in an OPREP-3.
  7.10. Chemical / Effective Downwind Message and Basic Wind Message. 31 OSS/OSW
  produces and provides Chemical Downwind Messages, Basic Wind Messages, and Effective
  Wind Messages as requested to 31 CES/CEX and other base agencies. If possible, requesting
  agencies should submit request 30 minutes prior to the desired receipt time.
  7.11. SWAP.
     7.11.1. The purpose of SWAP is to provide a means for 31 OSS/OSW personnel to
     manage the additional strain and decision making processes that accompany severe
     weather. SWAP is a cooperative effort between the 21 OWS and 31 OSS/OSW in which
     each agency has specific roles and responsibilities as defined in AFMAN 15-129V1/V2.
     7.11.2. The primary approach used by 31 OSS/OSW to accomplish SWAP is the
     activation of the Severe Weather Team (SWT). Once activated, the SWT provides 31
     FW leadership with clear and timely notification of severe weather threatening Aviano
     AB. This team, at a minimum, consists of a SWT Leader and the duty forecaster. The
     SWT Leader normally is the 31 OSS/OSW Flight CC, WWO or Flight Chief. The SWT
     leader recalls additional members as needed to collectively manage the threat, operate the
     radar, record and disseminate observations and provide mission and airfield services.
     7.11.3. The SWT is implemented at any time when the following watches or warnings
     are issued by the 21 OWS for Aviano AB:
         7.11.3.1. Tornado
         7.11.3.2. Winds >45kts (either convective or non-convective)
         7.11.3.3. Hail >1/2‖
         7.11.3.4. Severe weather has been observed at Aviano AB. (General thunderstorms
         with no significant winds or hail associated are not considered ―severe.‖)
         7.11.3.5. The 31 OSS/OSW Flight CC, WWO, Flight Chief or duty forecaster
         determines the potential for severe weather is strong enough to warrant SWT
         activation.
     7.11.4. The SWT Leader may implement SWAP but delay actual formation of the team
     anytime the potential or expected onset time of severe weather is more than two hours
     beyond notification time.
AVIANOABI15-101 26 DECEMBER 2012                                                            23


      7.11.5. At a minimum, 31 OSS/OSW and 21 OWS conduct and document a semi-annual
      exercise of coordinated SWAP. An actual severe weather event meets the intent of an
      exercise.
      7.11.6. During hours of airfield closure, 21 OWS passes all watches and warnings to the
      31 FW/CP and the standby forecaster, who then notifies the Flight CC, WWO or Flight
      Chief. The leadership of 31 OSS/OSW assesses the situation and determines the need to
      implement SWAP.
   7.12. Actions by Base Agencies. IAW 31 FW Plan 10-2, Emergency Management (EM),
   base agencies have specific actions required when notified of imminent severe weather
   conditions. Base agencies should review and perform these actions upon receiving
   notification of a severe weather watch or warning issued by either 31 OSS/OSW or 21 OWS.
8. Reciprocal Support
   8.1. General. 31 OSS/OSW requires daily support in order to best accomplish its mission.
   This chapter outlines the support required by other agencies at Aviano AB. Per AFMAN 15-

Thunderstorms                           Incorrect by forecasted start time or end time.
Other Amendment Situations              Any time a forecaster considers it advisable to amend the TAF in the
                                        interest of safety, efficiency of aircraft operations, flight planning,
                                        operational control, or in-flight assistance to aircraft to ensure the
                                        forecast is representative of actual or forecast conditions.

  A3.3. TAF Amendment Actions. 21 OWS is primarily responsible for TAF amendment. In
  the event that 21 OWS is unable to amend, 31 OSS/OSW amends the TAF during duty hours.
  TAF Amendments are accomplished with the following guidelines:
      A3.3.1. Anytime an unforecast change meeting the TAF amendment criteria is expected to
      occur and is expected to last more than 30 minutes and is not correctly forecast by the next
      whole hour.
      A3.3.2. Anytime an unforecast change meeting the TAF amendment criteria occurs, is
      expected to last at least 30 minutes and is not forecast by the next whole hour from the time
      of occurrence.
      A3.3.3. Anytime a forecast condition meeting the TAF amendment criteria does not occur
      by the specified hour and is not expected to occur within the next 30 minutes.
      A3.3.4. Anytime a forecast condition within a temporary (TEMPO) group becomes
      predominant or is not expected to occur.
  A3.4. LAST NO AMDS. When the 31 OSS/OSW is closed, 21 OWS appends the last line of
  the TAF with the words ―LAST NO AMDS‖. During these times the forecast is only amended
  for warning criteria defined in Table 10
  A3.5. TAF Specification Criteria. In addition to the criteria listed in Table A3.1, the 21 OWS
  forecaster must consider additional weather criteria as deemed operationally significant by local
  customers. These non-amendable criteria are required to be specified when issuing the initial
  and any subsequent TAFs. 31 OSS/OSW forecasters have the leverage to adjust their local
  products and briefings to meet the specified needs of the local customers provided the adjusted
  forecast does not cross amendment thresholds without prior coordination between the 21 OWS
  and 31 OSS/OSW forecasters.
      A3.5.1. Ceiling less than or equal to 8,000, 1,100, 900, 800, 700 and 600.
      A3.5.2. Visibility less than or equal to 3600m, 1200m, and less than 400m.
      A3.5.3. Onset time, duration, type and intensity of precipitation, icing, turbulence and non-
      convective low-level wind shear.

              OBSERVED INDUCTION ICING AT AVIANO AB.
A4.5. Dissemination. The 21 OWS uses the Integrated Weather Warning Capability (IWWC)
to disseminate weather watches, warning, and advisories. IWWC is an automated telephonic
system which notifies agencies of WWA. If the IWWC system fails or is non-operational, the 31
OSS/OSW leverages a pyramid notification system to promptly disseminate weather watches,
warnings, and advisories. 21 OWS initiates the process by disseminating, canceling, or
extending an advisory, watch, or warning over IWWC. Upon receiving watches, warnings, or
advisories via telephone, the 31 FW/CP and 31 OSS/OSAB disseminates the alert to other
agencies on Aviano AB via telephone notification. Each organization is responsible for internal

dissemination and forwarding the message onto other agencies further down the chain. When
IWWC is inoperable, 31 OSS/OSW and 21 OWS use telephone notification as the primary
means to transmit watches and warnings. Figure A5.1 Illustrates the dissemination pyramid.
A4.6. Backup Calls. To verify receipt of issues, extensions, or cancellations of watches and
warnings, 31 OSS/OSW calls critical agencies. 31 OSS/OSW verifies for all watches and
warnings whether or not issued by 21 OWS. 21 OWS also calls the 31 FW/CP to verify receipt.

is in the QRC 60 located in the Command Post. Changes to this notification process will need to be
coordinated with the Command Post and the 31 OSS)
