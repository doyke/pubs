       directional signs throughout the building, based on building size.
       2.5.4. A SIP kit must be maintained inside of the SIP room and be inventoried every six
       months. The unit has the overall funding responsibility to ensure all items are procured
       for the SIP room. The following items are required in the SIP room:
           2.5.4.1. Items to secure the room such as duct tape, plastic sheeting, scissors, and SIP
           signs.

    established to complete the functions outlined in AFI 10-2501 and this publication. The
    purpose of the GCC/UCCs is to provide a focal point within the unit to maintain unit
    command and control, relay information to and from unit personnel, provide expertise when
    requested, maintain accountability of all unit personnel, and leverage unit resources when
    directed. The EM rep must ensure the following:
       2.6.1. Ensure there is a current GCC/UCC appointment letter on file that identifies at
       least two full-time personnel, and two traditional reservists, for manning of the

   3.1. Unit commanders are responsible for ensuring their personnel attend required training
   according to AFI 10-2501, other responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:
   3.2. Only the 514 EM Flight, EM representatives, unit schedulers, and commanders may
   schedule, cancel, or change requests for training (as designated on the unit’s EM appointment
   letter).
   3.3. A course certificate is provided upon successful completion of the CBRN Defense
   Awareness Course. This certificate must be printed out and given to the Unit Scheduler
   before the student can be scheduled for and attend the CBRN Defense Survival Skills
   Course.
   3.4. The following list of equipment are a part of the Ground Crew Ensemble and are
   required to be on hand in clean, dry, and serviceable condition by all students to receive
   credit for the CBRN Defense Survival Skills training: gas mask with carrier, filters, outsert
   (clear), head harness, canteen cap, gas mask inserts (if applicable), and individual equipment
   carrier bag, Joint Service Light-Weight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) top and bottom,
   black butyl rubber gloves with white cotton inserts, and black vinyl over boots.
   3.5. Any students arriving late to class or without all required training equipment will not be
   permitted to attend and will be counted as a no show.
   3.6. Units are responsible for scheduling, tracking, and documenting all EM program-related
   training for their personnel assigned to positions in support of the Disaster Response Force,
   to include credit for refresher training completed via exercise or real world accident/incident
   participation. These positions include 514 AMW EOC representative and GCC/UCC
   representatives.
   3.7. Scheduling Procedures.
       3.7.1. Unit Schedulers. Units will appoint a unit scheduler to track and schedule
       personnel for training. The unit scheduler should be a part of the unit’s training section,
       the unit deployment manager, or the unit EM representative.
       3.7.2. All CBRN Defense Survival Skills training will be scheduled through the
       Automated Civil Engineer System (ACES) Unit Scheduler. New Unit Scheduler
       accounts will be obtained through the 514 CES/CEX after personnel have been appointed
       on the unit’s EM appointment letter.

       3.7.3. An annual training schedule will be provided by 514 CES/CEX. Schedulers will
       determine and schedule those personnel who need training. Units will manage and utilize
       assigned quotas. 514 CES/CEX works closely with units to ensure unit EM training
       needs are met and establishes training schedules to minimize productivity loss.
       Schedulers can verify attendance by checking ACES Unit Scheduler or rosters uploaded
       the 514 Emergency Management SharePoint Site.
          3.7.3.1. Survival Skills classes are offered during the week by the 87 CES/CEX and
          individuals will be scheduled to attend these classes when at all possible.
          3.7.3.2. Unit Schedulers will contact 514 CES/CEX in order to schedule personnel
          into the active duty Survival Skills course.
       3.7.4. A minimum of 10 students must be scheduled for a class in order for the class to
       be held by 514 CES/CEX. If a scheduled class does not meet the minimum requirement,
       any personnel scheduled for the class may be rescheduled at the discretion of 514
       CES/CEX.
4. Equipment. This section establishes local procedures and identifies responsibilities for
management of chemical-biological warfare defense equipment.
   4.1. Training Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense Equipment
   (CBRN-DE).
       4.1.1. Training CBRN-DE consists of the two-piece JSLIST ensemble, one pair of
       overboots, one pair of butyl rubber gloves with cotton inserts. The Joint Service General
       Purpose Mask (JSGPM) M-50 is used for both training and deployed operational
       requirements. There is no such thing as a “training only mask”.
       4.1.2. Units must maintain and/or have access to enough training equipment to support
       training and exercise objectives.
       4.1.3. Commanders must ensure only unit personnel issued a JSGPM are those assigned
       to a “DW” coded position. All other JSGPM must be turned into base supply. Deployers
       not in a “DW” coded position will be issued a mask when out-processing for deployment.
       4.1.4. Any MCU-2P protective masks maintained by a unit must be turned into base
       supply.
       4.1.5. JSGPMs (M50 protective masks) issued to unit members are stored and
       maintained at the unit level. Storage and maintenance procedures will be implemented
       according to T.O. 14P4-20-1.
       4.1.6. Units who maintain a supply of CBRN-DE will need to be able to produce these
       items for a spot inspection during SAVs. Units should also conduct their own inspections
       of CBRN-DE.

  4.2. Technical Orders. Units with equipment will maintain technical orders for their
  assigned items.
