Force Fisher Houses ® are established to provide temporary lodging for families of patients who
are hospitalized for complicated or critical medical problems. It applies to all of 673d Air Base
Wing (673 ABW) and tenant unit personnel assigned to JBER, other uniformed services
personnel, and veterans supported by the JBER community. This instruction applies to the Air
National Guard or US Air Force Reserve units and members. Refer recommended changes and

1. Scope:
     1.1. A stay in a military hospital, sometimes thousands of miles from home, could mean
     expensive lodging and long separations from loved ones. In recognition of the special
     sacrifices of severely wounded or ill service members and their families, the Fisher House
     Foundation ® donates “comfort homes” so families can face medical crises together. Built
     on the grounds of major military and Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers, these “home
     away from home” residences, extend the support normally provided by the respective
     military services and the Department of VA. This instruction was created to ensure extended
     support is properly implemented and administered at JBER in support of the Alaska Fisher
     House ® (AFH).
     1.2. The Fisher House Foundation ® was created in 1990 by Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher.
     The Foundation constructs and donates Fisher Houses to the Department of Defense (DoD)
     and VA for use by families of patients hospitalized in military and VA hospitals. Fisher
     Houses are given to the US government as gifts. Military service secretaries and the
     Secretary of VA are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the homes. The Fisher
     House Foundation, Inc. ®, a not-for-profit organization under section 501(c)(3) of the IRS
     code, builds new houses, assists in coordinating private support, and encourages public
     support for the homes. Donations to the Fisher House Foundation, Inc. ®, and to the Air
     Force Fisher House Fund (AFFHF), the central NAF instrumentality (NAFI) created in
     accordance with 10 USC Section 2493, are         tax-deductible to the maximum extent allowed
     by law. Each Fisher House is professionally decorated and furnished and has a common
     kitchen, laundry facility, dining room, and living room.
     1.3. The mission of the AFH is to provide support and temporary lodging to patients with
     critical medical problems who use the facilities, and their families. The AFH is adjacent to
     the DoD/VA Joint Venture Hospital.
     1.4. Fisher Houses are designed for use by family members of hospitalized military members
     or veterans to include all branches of the Armed Forces, US Coast Guard, National Guard
     and Reserve Units. However, military members or veterans undergoing outpatient treatment
     who do not live within 50 miles of Anchorage may be accommodated at AFH along with
     their family members or care providers. Exceptions to the 50 mile criterion apply to sponsors
     who reside in barracks or dorms and therefore cannot accommodate housing for caregivers or
     in cases of extreme hardship of the sponsor, family or care provider.
     1.5. Accommodation in the AFH is on a first-come, first-served basis. No fees may be
     charged to military members, veterans, or their family members for lodging in the AFH.
     Families of patients returning from an active war zone will receive first priority. In
     establishing other priorities, the intent is to place those persons who will be helped the most
     into the AFH first. This help may be in the form of the emotional support provided by the
     AFH “atmosphere” and the presence of the other guests who are experiencing similar
     problems; it may be financial assistance due to the low cost of staying in the AFH compared
     to staying in a guest house or hotel; or a combination of these and other factors. The
     following are some of the criteria which should be considered in determining each guest’s
     relative priority for placement into the house:
        1.5.1. Severity of Medical Condition:
673ABWI65-101 31 MAY 2013                                                                      3


          1.5.1.1. PRIORITY 1. Is defined as guests of all critical care patients to include
          those evacuated out of an active war zone, families of the fallen, and those admitted
          to the hospital as inpatients. PRIORITY 1 guests may book in advance and are
          authorized an unlimited stay. Eligibility will be reviewed every 30 days.
          1.5.1.2. PRIORITY 2. Is defined as eligible guests/care-providers who are NOT on
          funded medical orders but who are receiving ongoing (e. g., cancer treatment, high-
          risk pregnancy, etc.) out-patient medical treatment at a local facility. PRIORITY 2
          guests may book in advance and are authorized a maximum stay of 30 days.
          1.5.1.3. PRIORITY 3. Is defined as eligible guests/care-providers who are on
          FUNDED medical orders and who are receiving out-patient medical treatment at a
          local facility. PRIORITY 3 guests may place themselves on a standby list and may
          be booked into an available room 30 working days in advance. Statements of non-
          availability will be issued if the AFH is unable to accommodate a request.
          PRIORITY 3 guests are authorized a maximum stay of 7 days. If a higher priority
          guest subsequently requires use of the Fisher House they may be released off base
          and given a statement of non-availability.
       1.5.2. Other issues which may be taken into account (during in-processing) in
       determining placement in the House include suitability of the guest to reside in a
       communal environment, availability of private support in the area and financial
       need/hardship.

     guidance to potential donors to ensure the offer of a gift may be accepted for the specific
     purpose the private organization intends, and otherwise follows the guidance outlined in AFI
673ABWI65-101 31 MAY 2013                                                                    7


   34-201, paragraph 5.8. If accepted, a gift of money or property must be used for the purpose
   specified in the gift offer.
   3.2. A private organization or other donor may offer an unconditional gift of money or
   property. If accepted, unconditional gifts of money will be placed in the AFFHF NAFI
   subaccount for the AFH. This money will be treated as NAF money for NAF specific
   purposes.
   3.3. The AFFHFB has preapproved the offer of any gift of $500 and such donations do not
   require formal acceptance. Those donations will be placed in the AFFHF NAFI subaccount
   for the AFH and will be treated as NAF money for NAF specific purposes. All direct
   monetary donations to Alaska Fisher House ® will be recorded and reported to FSS on the
   Fisher House ® Contribution Record.
4. Funding:
   4.1. The AFFHF is an Air Force Supplemental Mission Support NAFI. Its installation-level
   operations are carried out through subaccounts of the AFFHF. Installation subaccount NAF
   revenues come from service charges collected from authorized personnel residing in the
   houses, sundry sales, interest income, donations, contributions, and other income. NAFs may
   be accumulated to maintain stable rates and to provide for capital expenditures such as room
   refurbishment and amenity upgrades.
   4.2. Single Fund Source. To prevent budgeting for the same expenditure using APFs and
   NAFs, the 673 MDG/CC must use a single fund source for each element of operation,
   maintenance, repair, and construction costs. When the fund source (see Attachment 3, this
   instruction) is APF, NAFs are not authorized and vice-versa, unless a waiver to the fund
   source is granted.
       4.2.1. Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management (SAF/FMC) approves
       requests for fund source waivers. The 673 FSS submits requests for exceptions to these
       funding policies to HQ PACAF/A1 for review. HQ PACAF/A1 then forwards
       recommendations for approval to AFSVA, USAF/ILV, and SAF/FMCEB, in turn.
       4.2.2. Each organization level may disapprove requests without forwarding the request to
       the next organization level. Only recommendations for approval should be forwarded to
       the next organization level.
5. Information Collections. No information collections are required by this publication.
