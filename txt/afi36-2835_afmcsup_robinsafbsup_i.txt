                                 CONTRACTING AWARDS

3.1. Nomination Responsibilities and Procedures. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs may submit
nominations as identified in Table 3.1 The J-4 of Unified and Joint Commands may nominate
Air Force military members or civilians according to the categories in Table 3.1
3.1. (AFMC) Nominations Responsibilities and Procedures. AFMC Outstanding
Contracting Unit/Team, Outstanding Officer in Contracting, and Outstanding Civilian in
Contracting awards will be given in each of the following categories: Operational/Specialized,
Science & Technology (S&T), Systems, and Logistics. Each AFMC center, including the Air
Force Research Laboratory, may submit a nominee in each category, as appropriate. Research
and development actions that normally precede and are directly related to systems development
fall under the Systems, not the S&T, category. AFMC will maintain a listing of units eligible to
compete in the ―specialized‖ category. Nominations from Operational Contracting Squadrons
must be submitted through the Senior Center Contracting Official after coordination by the
Mission Support Group Commander or the Wing Commander. Send all nomination packages by
transmittal letter to arrive at HQ AFMC/PKX by the deadline established in the AFMC/PK
request for nominations letter. The Center Director/Deputy Director of Contracting should sign
the transmittal letter. HQ AFMC/PK will forward the nominations for Air Force awards to
SAF/AQC after major command evaluation and endorsement. Any changes will be coordinated
with the nominating organization. Organizations are responsible for advising HQ AFMC/PKX
of any name or rank changes for AFMC award winners and Air Force nominees.
3.2. Definition of Unit. Unit refers to buying offices, flights, squadrons, or program offices. It
includes activities issuing operational, systems, logistics, science & technology, specialized, or
classified contracts. Non-contracting activities that support the contracting community, such as
training centers, may compete for the Outstanding Unit award. Teams of individuals from these
activities may be nominated.
     3.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Operational/Specialized. This category applies to base level
     operational contracting squadrons/divisions and specialized buying offices whose primary
     mission is to provide unique support in other than logistics, systems, or science and
     technology. An operational unit provides contractual support for base operations support or
     mission operations support. A specialized unit, typically, has a mission of command-wide or
     Air Force-wide support as opposed to supporting only one base, or has a mission to acquire
     non-standard supplies and services or special studies and analyses. A specialized unit may
     include a non-buying activity that supports the contracting community, such as training
     centers. A specialized unit may or may not be a contracting squadron.
     3.2.1. (ROBINSAFB) Outstanding Quality Assurance (QA) Person of the Quarter. Each
     January, April, July and September, Functional Directors (FD) and Functional Commanders
     (FC) will select their nominees for Outstanding QA person of the prior quarter. Quarterly
     nominees will be based on the QA person’s performance of duties and responsibilities during
     the periods 1 October through 31 December (1st FY Quarter), 1 January through 31 March
     (2nd FY Quarter), 1 April through 30 June (3rd FY Quarter), and 1 July through 15
     September (4th FY Quarter).

   3.2.3. (Added-AFMC) Systems. This category applies to buying offices with a primary
   mission to develop and procure new systems or new modifications to systems at Product
   Centers. It does not apply to the Product Center itself as a unit.
   3.2.4. (Added-AFMC) Logistics. This category applies to buying offices with a primary
   mission to provide sustainment support (repair, spares replenishment, modification, and
   engineering services) contracting at Logistics Centers. It does not apply to the Logistic
   Center itself as a unit.

NOTE:
6. (AFMC) (Added) AFMC/PK will break out this award into four categories:
operational/specialized, systems, S&T, and logistics. AFMC/PK will select unit, team or
individuals to be forwarded for competition at the AF level. NOTE: For teams of ten people or
less, there will be a team award memento and each team member will receive a small individual
memento. Teams comprised of more than ten people will receive a team award memento and a
certificate for each member of the team. Contractor personnel are not eligible for consideration
as part of a team award. If an individual contractor employee has performed exceptionally well
on a team or made a contribution which significantly exceeded the terms of the contract, the
Government may acknowledge that contribution by a letter to the individual's company. This
"letter of appreciation" should be coordinated with the cognizant contracting officer before
sending to the contractor who will then present it to the contractor employee.

Example: (for Secretary of the Air Force Professionalism in Contracting Award) As an instructor and
author of contracting articles published in professional magazines and journals, Ms. Smith has fostered
the growth and development of others in our field. She is an accomplished contract negotiator with
multi-service contracting experience. She achieved superior results on complex programs supporting
vital Air Force programs.

Example: (for Other Individual Awards) Mr. Jones developed innovative ideas and contracting
concepts, resolving long-standing problems affecting mission essential service contracts. He developed
an innovative contract for altitude chamber testing that will save the government $52,000 and 180 days
of pilot downtime annually. In support of Operation DESERT STORM, he restructured contracts for
critical services affected by government personnel deployments. The end result was continued
excellent support of the Air Force mission.
