 8                                                  LITTLEROCKAFBI31-213 25 APRIL 2013


     2.5.4. Records of board proceedings will be maintained by the board recorder as prescribed
     by records management policies.
2.6. Off–Limits Establishments and Areas
     2.6.1. The establishment of off–limits areas is a function of command. It may be used by 19
     AW/CC to help maintain good order and discipline, health, morale, safety and welfare of
     personnel assigned to LRAFB. Off–limits action is also intended to prevent personnel from
     being exposed to or victimized by crime–conducive conditions. Where sufficient cause
     exists, the 19 AW/CC retains substantial discretion to declare establishments or areas
     temporarily off–limits to personnel assigned to LRAFB. Temporary off–limits restrictions
     issued by the 19 AW/CC in an emergency situation will be acted upon by the LRDCB as a
     first priority. As a matter of policy, a change in ownership, management or name of any off–
     limits establishment does not, in and of itself, revoke the off–limits restriction.
     2.6.2. Military members assigned to Little Rock AFB are prohibited from entering
     establishments or areas declared off–limits according to this regulation. Violations may
     subject the member to disciplinary action per applicable Air Force instructions and the
     Uniform Code of Military Justice. Family members of military personnel and others
     associated with the installation should be made aware of off–limits restrictions. As a general
     policy, these establishments will not be visited by personnel in a law enforcement capacity
     unless specifically determined by the 19 AW/CC or board president that visits or surveillance
     is warranted.
        2.6.2.1. Military members assigned to Little Rock AFB will be notified of off-limits
        establishments by letter disseminated throughout the wing signed by the 19 AW/CC or
        board president. Letters disseminated to the squadrons should be posted on bulletin
        boards and disseminated to squadron sections to be briefed. Off-limit locations should be
        briefed at Commander’s Call, during FTAC, and newcomer’s briefings held at the
        Airmen and Family Readiness Center (A&FRC). When an emergency meeting is held to
        determine to place an establishment off-limits, notifications should be sent through email
        from 19 AW/PA or OSI until a new letter is signed by 19 AW/CC or board president.
     2.6.3. Except when emergency situations exist, prior to initiating a LRDCB action, the
     19 AW/CC or board president will attempt to correct adverse conditions or situations through
     the assistance of civic leaders or officials.
     2.6.4. Except when emergency situations exist, prior to recommending off–limits restriction,
     the LRDCB will send a written notice (certified mail; return receipt requested) to the
     individual or firm responsible for the alleged condition or situation. In the notice, the
     LRDCB will specify a reasonable time for the condition or situation to be corrected, along
     with the opportunity to present any relevant information to the board. If subsequent
     investigation reveals the responsible person has failed to take corrective action, the board will
     recommend the imposition of the off–limits restriction (see para 2.6.1.).
     2.6.5. A specified time limit will not be established when an off–limits restriction is invoked.
     The adequacy of the corrective action taken by the responsible individual will be the
     determining factor in removing an off–limits restriction.
     2.6.6. A person whose establishment or area has been declared off–limits may, at any time,
     petition the president of the board to remove the off–limits restriction. The petition will be in
LITTLEROCKAFBI31-213 25 APRIL 2013                                                           9


   writing and will include a detailed report of action taken to eliminate the condition or
   situation that caused imposition of the restriction. The president of LRDCB may direct an

   morals of installation personnel. These adverse conditions include, but are not limited to,

   involving discrimination based on race, color, sex, sexual orientation, religion, age or
   national origin.
2.10. Off–Limits Procedures
   2.10.1. The decision tree (Attachment 1) is an example of how the off-limits decision
   making process should occur. Off–limits restrictions should be invoked only when there is
   substantive information indicating an establishment or area frequented by LRAFB personnel
   presents conditions which adversely affect their health, safety, welfare, morale or morals. It
   is essential the board does not act arbitrarily and actions must not be of a punitive nature.
   The board should work in close cooperation with local officials and proprietors of business
   establishments and seek to accomplish their mission through mutually cooperative efforts.
   The board should encourage personal visits by local military and civilian enforcement or
   health officials to establishments considered below standard. The LRDCB should point out
   unhealthy conditions or undesirable practices to establishment owners or operators to
   produce the desired corrective action.
   2.10.2. In cases involving discrimination, the board should not rely solely on letters written
   by the Equal Opportunity Office and Military Affairs Committee or investigations of alleged
   racial discrimination.
   2.10.3. If the board decides to attempt to investigate or inspect an establishment, the
   president or a designee will prepare and submit a report of findings and recommendations at
   the next meeting. This procedure will ensure complete and documented information
   concerning questionable adverse conditions.
   2.10.4. When the board concludes that conditions are adverse to military members, the
   owner or manager will be sent a letter of notification (Attachment 2). This letter will advise
   him or her to raise standards by a specified date and if such conditions or practices continue,
   off–limits proceedings will be initiated. Any correspondence with the individuals
   responsible for adverse conditions which may lead to off–limits action will be by certified
   mail.
   2.10.5. If a proprietor takes remedial action to correct undesirable conditions previously
   noted, the board should send a letter of appreciation (Attachment 3) recognizing this
   cooperation.
   2.10.6. If undesirable conditions are not corrected, the proprietor will be invited to appear
   before the LRDCB to explain why the establishment should not be placed off–limits
   (Attachment 4). Any proprietor may designate, in writing, a representative to appear before
   the board on his or her behalf.
   2.10.7. In cases where proprietors have been invited to appear before the board, the president
   of the board will perform the following:
      2.10.7.1. Prior to calling the proprietor:
          2.10.7.1.1. Review the findings and decision of the previous meeting.
LITTLEROCKAFBI31-213 25 APRIL 2013                                                             11


          2.10.7.1.2. Call for inspection reports.
          2.10.7.1.3. Allow those present to ask questions and discuss the case.
      2.10.7.2. When the proprietor or his or her representative is called before the board:
          2.10.7.2.1. Present the proprietor with a brief summary of the complaint concerning
          the establishment.
          2.10.7.2.2. Afford the proprietor an opportunity to present matters in defense.
          2.10.7.2.3. Invite those present to question the proprietor. After the questioning
          period, provide the proprietor an opportunity to make a final statement prior to
          starting deliberations.
   2.10.8. Deliberations on recommended actions will be in closed session, attended only by
   board members.
   2.10.9. The board should recommend off–limits restriction only after the following:
      2.10.9.1. The letter of notification (Attachment 2) has been sent.
      2.10.9.2. An opportunity for the proprietor to appear before the board has been extended.
      2.10.9.3. Further investigation indicates that improvements have not been made.
   2.10.10. The minutes will indicate the LRDCB’s action in each case.           When a
   recommendation is made to place an establishment off–limits, the minutes will show the
   procedural steps followed in reaching the decision.
   2.10.11. Recommendations of the LRDCB will be submitted to the 19 AW/CC for approval.
   2.10.12. Upon approval of the LRDCB’s recommendations, the president will write the
   proprietor that the off–limits restriction has been imposed (Attachment 6).
   2.10.13. A time limit should not be specified when an off–limits restriction is imposed. The
   adequacy of the corrective action taken by the proprietor of the establishment must be the
   determining factor in removing the off–limits restriction.
   2.10.14. In emergencies, the 19 AW/CC may temporarily declare establishments or areas
   off–limits to personnel assigned to LRAFB (see Attachment 7). The circumstances for the
   action will be reported as soon as possible to the LRDCB. Detailed justification for this
   emergency action will be provided to the board for its deliberations.
   2.10.15. The LRDCB will publish a list of off–limits establishments and areas using 19
   AW/PA media channels or other available means to insure the widest possible dissemination.
2.11. Removal of Off–Limits Restrictions
   2.11.1. Removal of an off–limits restriction requires LRDCB action and approval by the
   19 AW/CC. Proprietors of establishments declared off–limits should be advised that they
   may petition the appropriate LRDCB at any time. In their petition, they should submit the
   reason why the restriction should be removed. A letter of notification for continuance of the
   off–limits restriction should be sent to the proprietor, if the sponsoring commander does not
   remove the off–limits restriction (Attachment 8). The proprietor may appeal to the next
   higher commander after exhausting all appeals at the local sponsoring commander level. The
   LRDCB shall appoint a designee who should make at least quarterly inspections of off–limits
 12                                              LITTLEROCKAFBI31-213 25 APRIL 2013


   establishments. A statement that an inspection has been completed should be included in
   LRDCB minutes.
   2.11.2. When the board learns the proprietor has taken adequate corrective measures, the
   LRDCB will take the following actions:
      2.11.2.1. Discuss the matter at the next meeting and make an appropriate
      recommendation.
      2.11.2.2. Forward a recommendation for removal of the off–limits restriction to the
      board president. If approved, a letter removing the restriction (Attachment 9 or
      Attachment 10) will be sent to the proprietor.
      2.11.2.3. Reflect action taken in the minutes.
2.12. Minutes
   2.12.1. Minutes will be prepared by the board recorder in accordance with administrative
   formats for minutes of meetings prescribed by the sponsoring commander (Attachment 11).
   The written minutes of LRDCB meetings will constitute the official record of the LRDCB
   proceedings. Verbatim transcripts of board meetings are not required. The reasons for
   approving or removing an off–limits restriction, including a complete address of the
   establishment or area involved, should be indicated in the order of business. In addition, the
   LRDCB’s action will be shown in the order or sequence of actions taken. A change in the
   name of an establishment or areas in an off–limits restriction will also be included.
   2.12.2. Distribution of the minutes of LRDCB meetings will be limited to the following:
      2.12.2.1. Each voting member.
      2.12.2.2. Civilian and governmental agencies within the State of Arkansas in which
