                 EMERGENCY FAMILY MEMBER TRAVEL (EFMT):

A2.1. General. The Air Force may provide round-trip transportation, lodging, and per diem for
not more than three family members traveling to the medical facility (military/civilian) of a
member who is Very Seriously Ill/Injured (VSI) or Seriously Ill/Injured (SI) and placed in a
casualty status of VSI, SI (also Not Seriously Ill/Injured (NSI) if OCO related). The attending
physician/surgeon and the commander or director of the medical facility exercising military
control over the member determines if the presence of Next of Kin (NOK), or individuals
standing as loco parentis, may contribute to the member's health and welfare (Title 37 U.S.C.,
Section 41 1h). NOK can either be spouse, child, mother, father, brother, sister or someone who
was standing in loco parentis within one year prior to member joining the armed services. When
requesting parents at bedside, only one mother and one father (natural or step parent) can be
authorized EFMT. EFMT entitlements apply to active duty personnel (including ANG and AF
Reserve personnel serving in an Active Duty status).
A2.2. Responsibilities:
   A2.2.1. Medical personnel responsibilities: The attending physician initiates the request for
   EFMT.
   A2.2.2. Military Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) commander's responsibilities: The MTF
   commander determines that the presence of the family member may contribute to the
   member's health and welfare and concurs with the attending physician's EFMT request. The
   term "health and welfare", with respect to the member, includes a situation in which a
   decision must be made by family members regarding the termination of artificial life support
   being provided to the member. He/she must ensure that the CAR is immediately notified of
   the request and is provided all required information to effect EFMT approval and
   arrangement of transportation by HQ AFPC/DPWCS.
   A2.2.3. Unit Commander’s Responsibilities: When advised by the CAR of the NOK’s
   approved itinerary, the unit commander assigns the NOK an escort to arrange for the
   reception, quarters, and further assistance needed. He/she ensures that the escort stays in
   contact with the NOK during the stay, and informs the CAR when return transportation is
   required.
   A2.2.4. CAR Responsibilities: The CAR is the overall focal point for the EFMT program.
   The CAR coordinates all actions with HQ AFPC.

     CASUALTY AUGMENTATION SUPPORT TEAM (CAST) RESPONSIBILITIES

A3.1. Purpose. The purpose of the CAST is to ensure casualties are reported to HQ AFPC
Casualty Operations Center in the shortest possible time to ensure prompt, accurate, and humane
notification of NOK. The CAST is composed of personnel assigned within the Military
Personnel Section (MPS) and Airman and Family Readiness Center (AFRC).
A3.2. MPS Chief responsibilities. When notified of a situation involving mass casualties, the
MPS Chief will authorize recall of the CAST to augment the Casualty Assistance Representative
(CAR) as necessary. The MPS Chief will also determine if TDY manning assistance from other
Casualty Assistance representatives is required to provide additional support for casualty
reporting, assistance, etc. When telephone contact with AFPC Casualty Operations Center
cannot be established, the MPS Chief determines if abbreviated casualty reports are required.
A3.3. Training. CAST members will participate in quarterly training (conducted by the CAR)
and base level exercises that facilitate familiarization with casualty reporting procedures.
