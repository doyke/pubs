prevention program. It is used in conjunction with AFI 21-101, Maintenance Management of
Aircraft, and CAF 21-101, Aircraft Maintenance Organization and Procedures, AFI 21-101
354FW_SUP, Aerospace equipment Maintenance Management. It is applicable to all 354th
Fighter Wing assigned and tenant units to the extent of their responsibilities as addressed. Ensure
that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm

1. General. The high cost of damage to equipment and injury to USAF personnel dictates that
all commanders and supervisors strictly comply with FOD prevention directives. Foreign object
(FO) removal is the first step in FOD prevention. Annual briefings will be documented by the
responsible organization.
2. Responsibilities
   2.1. Table 1 lists those individuals appointed as members of the wing FOD prevention
   committee. Personnel occupying these positions or their alternates will attend all meetings.

     2.2. A FOD bulletin board is kept at all maintenance locations and all workcenters with
     assigned personnel that access the airfield. One centrally located board may cover all shops
     located in a single building. Placement is at the discretion of the individual shop, but the
     location must provide the greatest visual access to personnel. The squadrons are responsible
     for obtaining and maintaining the bulletin board. The space on the bulletin board may be
     shared provided the following items are displayed
        2.2.1. Most recent FOD GRAM published by the wing FOD prevention monitor.
        2.2.2. FOD prevention point of contact visual aid.
        2.2.3. Posters, pictures, and other items pertaining to FOD prevention. To include the
        most current FOD poster published by the wing FOD prevention monitor.
3. General FOD Prevention Practices:
     3.1. Flightline Vehicle FOD Prevention:
        3.1.1. The FOD prevention representative for Airfield Management will ensure the
        drivers’ training program stresses the importance of FOD prevention and control
        applicable to vehicle operations on the flightline.
        3.1.2. Vehicles will only access the aircraft parking areas, taxiways and runway by entry
        points approved by Airfield Management. FOD checks will be accomplished on vehicles
        and towed trailers or equipment at these entry points prior to entering the airfield. If
        leaving a paved surface becomes necessary, re-check all tires for debris before re-
        entering. Debris will be deposited in vehicle FOD cans or tossed to the side, clear of the
        pavement area. Do not leave removed debris on access road! Security forces and
        Airfield Management will assist in monitoring for compliance of FOD tire checks. FOD
        checks will be accomplished by inspecting and removing FOD from all tires, then starting
        the vehicle and rolling forward to expose the area of tires that were on the bottom. Then
        re-inspect the tires and remove debris prior to entering the airfield. If the driver remains
        in the vehicle while other personnel perform the FOD check, the driver will place the
        vehicle in park rather than keep his/her foot on the brake.
354FWI 21-135 11 JANUARY 2012                                                                    3


     3.1.3. Any item lost or suspected lost on the airfield will be reported to Airfield
     Management or Maintenance Operations              Center (MOC).        MOC and Airfield
     Management will notify the other office if a lost item is reported to them.
     3.1.4. Fire department personnel will ensure a FOD check is completed on all vehicles
     on standby status in the fire station bays. Vehicles returning to the fire station or airfield
     taxiways from unpaved or broken pavement areas will have a FOD check performed by
     the vehicle operator.
     3.1.5. Except for emergency response vehicles, magnets are required on all pickup, step
     van and AGE bobtail vehicles used daily on the flightline. Magnets will be used year
     round and will hang with a 3 to 5-inch clearance from pavement surface. When snow
     accumulation exceeds clearance, the magnet will be flipped up and stuck to bumper or
     removed until snow is swept or plowed. Vehicles utilizing magnets will add "remove
     debris from magnet" to an available "other" block on AF Form 1800/1806, Operator’s
     Inspection Guide and Trouble Report.
     3.1.6. FOD picking tools and a serviceable flashlight are mandatory for all vehicles that
     operate on the flightline. In addition, all FOD picking tools and flashlights will be etched
     with the vehicle ID number. FOD picking tools and flashlights will be annotated on the
     vehicle’s AF Form 1800/1806. Security forces vehicles will be exempt from having to
     maintain a flashlight in their vehicles due to their requirement to have one on their person
     during daily execution of their duties.
     3.1.7. All items permanently assigned to a vehicle (seasonal or not) will be marked with
     the vehicle ID number and annotated on the vehicle’s AF Form 1800/1806 to ensure
     accountability. Equipment originally provided with a vehicle is exempt from this
     requirement, such as owner’s manuals, vehicle jacks and others. Vehicle rope chocks
     are exempt from the marking requirement. When not in use, chocks will be stored inside
     the vehicle or in the truck bed/tool box. If lost or misplaced, these items will be reported
     in accordance with lost tool/items procedures and annotated on a CAF 145.
     3.1.8. FOD containers must be secured to the vehicle in a manner that would prevent the
     container from tipping over while the vehicle is in motion. The lid must be secured to
     prevent the container from inadvertently opening. The FOD container will be listed on
     the 1800/1806 if not permanently affixed to the vehicle. “Empty FOD container daily”
     will be added to an available “Other” block on the AF Form 1800/1806.
     3.1.9. All pintle hooks will have cotter pin installed whether open or closed, and pin will
     be secured to vehicle or support equipment by means of chain or wire rope.
     3.1.10. Due to composition of Eielson AFB taxiways, studded tires will not be used and
     tire chain usage should be minimized. Airfield Management will determine when the use
     of chains is authorized.
     3.1.11. Metal valve stem caps are not authorized on any flightline vehicle or support
     equipment. Metal valve caps will be dispose of and replaced with plastic caps.
  3.2. Individual responsibilities:
     3.2.1. Maintenance personnel will police up their work areas prior to leaving the job site
     for any reason.
 4                                                          354FWI 21-135 11 JANUARY 2012


        3.2.2. Maintenance personnel may wear FOD pouches while on the flightline.
        3.2.3. Except for issue type winter headwear worn during cold weather operations, hats
        will not be worn on the flightline. When winter headwear is worn, extreme care will be
        exercised around operating aircraft engines to prevent ingestion. Security forces
        personnel are authorized beret wear except within 50 feet of operating engines.
4. Composite Tool Kit (CTK) Procedures:
     4.1. These procedures apply to non-aircraft maintenance units (18 AGRS, 353 CTS, LRS,
     CS, and CE) within the 354 FW. Squadron commanders in each organization are responsible
     for compliance with this instruction. 354th Maintenance Group units and assigned personnel
     will adhere to CTK procedures outlined in AFI 21-101, CAF_Sup1 and 354FW_Sup1
     Consolidated Tool Kit (CTK) Program. Visiting units will provide tool control procedures to
     Wing FOD manager for approval prior to arrival.
     4.2. The primary objective of the CTK program is to eliminate damage to aircraft and
     equipment due to lost or misplaced tools, and to reduce tool associated costs. These
     procedures will apply to CTKs used on facilities, vehicles, or equipment associated with the
     flightline.
     4.3. Responsibilities:
        4.3.1. Flight OIC/NCOICs will:
            4.3.1.1. Be responsible for the overall management of the CTK program within their
            respective flights.
            4.3.1.2. Incorporate a locally developed CTK inspection checklist into their self-
            inspection program to cover applicable CTKs.
        4.3.2. Tool room supervisors and primary/alternate CTK custodians will:
            4.3.2.1. Develop a master inventory list (MIL) for each applicable CTK. The listing
            will have as a minimum: tool nomenclature, quantity, serial number/TMDE number,
            total amount of tools in each drawer, and total amount of tools/items in the kit. The
            MIL will account for as separate items the key, chain, locks, cables, and FO bags.
            4.3.2.2. Perform CTK inventory inspections every 6 months (annual for mobility
            equipment) or when CTK custodian changes. Inspections will be documented on AF
            Form 2411 Inspection Document or in TAS if used.
            4.3.2.3. Ensure a unique identification and numbering system for CTKs is developed
            for each section, see AFI21-101_354FWSUP.
            4.3.2.4. Ensure personal use equipment (i.e. ear defenders, reflective belts) is marked
            with the owners first initial, last name, and employee number (i.e. J. Doe 12345). If
            the owner does not have an employee number, mark equipment with first initial, last
            name, and work center (i.e. J. Doe CEOH)
            4.3.2.5. Exchange broken or damaged tools one for one.          Document all
            missing/removed tools on MIL. Lost tools will be reissued and accounted for on
            CAF Form 145.
        4.3.3. Individual Users will:
354FWI 21-135 11 JANUARY 2012                                                                    5


         4.3.3.1. Be responsible for the security, cleanliness, and accountability of the CTK or
         tools they have been assigned.
         4.3.3.2. Inventory CTKs immediately prior to and after each job on the flightline.
         4.3.3.3. Report any lost tools to the work center supervisor immediately.
         4.3.3.4. Report damaged or unserviceable tool(s) to the tool room supervisor or
         primary/alternate CTK monitor.
         4.3.3.5. Remove all foreign objects (FO) prior to CTK turn-in.
  4.4. CTK and Tool Markings:
     4.4.1. Applicable CTKs and associated tools will be legibly marked with a unique alpha-
     numeric code identifying the squadron, flight, and number of the kit (including locks,
     keys, and FOD bags). Security cables and padlocks (if not attached) will be etched or
     marked with CTK number and added to the content list for the CTK.
     4.4.2. Tool kits will be stenciled with legible letters indicating kit number.
     4.4.3. Tools will have the CTK number etched on them. When the CTK number cannot
     be etched on the tool due to size or hardness of the tool, it will be accounted for during kit
     inventory by checking to make sure all inlay or shadow positions are filled. Tools with
     removable pieces will be etched, issued, and returned as one unit. Detachable pieces
     which do not affect the operation of the item (i.e., flashlight and screwdriver clip rings)
     will be removed.
     4.4.4. Subkits of CTKs (allen wrench sets, file sets, drill bit sets, helicoil subkits, etc.)
     will be stored as a "set" in a pouch or container. The pouch or container will be marked
     with the CTK identification number and the number of tools it contains (including the
     container).
     4.4.5. The corners of the dispatchable CTKs will have reflective tape for night visibility.
     4.4.6. Consumable items (safety wire, lubricants, erasers, and teflon tape) in CTKs will
     be marked and listed on the tool kit inventory.
  4.5. Control and Issue Inventory Procedures:
     4.5.1. Control:
         4.5.1.1. Dispatchable CTKs will not be left unlocked or unsecured. However, they
         will not be attached to any part of an aircraft, AGE, or vehicle exterior or left attached
         or secured at any location which would hinder aircraft, equipment, vehicle, or
         personnel movement.
     4.5.2. Issue and Inventory:
         4.5.2.1. An inventory and inspection will be performed on all CTKs at issue and
         turn-in. This can be accomplished at the beginning and end of each duty shift.
         4.5.2.2. Tools missing from a CTK (broken, on order, PMEL, etc.) will be
         documented on the MIL, by Tool Section personnel or primary/alternate CTK
         monitors.
6                                                          354FWI 21-135 11 JANUARY 2012


           4.5.2.3. TDY personnel and personnel from other workcenters requiring tools from a
           CTK will sign for tools on an AF Form 1297 or be issued chits. TDY personnel will
           be briefed on CTK procedures.
    4.6. Inspection Criteria:
       4.6.1. Account for all tools by inventory.
       4.6.2. Ensure CTK containers are free of foreign objects and debris.
       4.6.3. Ensure tools are clean and serviceable.
       4.6.4. Report damaged or broken tools and annotate MIL.
       4.6.5. Document MIL properly.
    4.7. Lost Tool Procedures:
       4.7.1. Notify the section supervisor and flight OIC/NCOIC of a lost tool/item as soon as
       possible. The section supervisor and/or flight OIC/NCOIC will initiate a CAF Form 145
       and will contact the MOC to obtain a control number. MOC will notify 354
       AMXS/MXA, 353 CTS/MOC (deployed Units), 354 MXS/MXM, and 354 MXG/QA as
       applicable. MOC will notify Airfield Management if lost item/tool is suspected to be on
       any airfield surface.
       4.7.2. Complete the CAF Form 145 IAW AFI 21-101, CAF_Sup1.
       4.7.3. Once initiated, the CAF Form 145 must be completed regardless of the status of
       the item.
       4.7.4. Conduct a search using the individual and supervisor. If the lost tool or object was
       in a shop and aircraft components were involved, the appropriate components will be
       inspected.
       4.7.5. The search will be terminated upon request of the section supervisor with
       concurrence of the flight OIC/NCOIC and respective Quality Assurance (QA) or the
       wing FOD prevention monitor.
       4.7.6. The CAF Form 145 will be kept for 12 months in the tool room/work center CTK
       continuity folder.
       4.7.7. The original completed CAF Form 145 will be delivered to the wing FOD
       prevention monitor within 5 duty days of initiation. Deliver the form to QA flight if the
       wing FOD prevention monitor is not available.
       4.7.8. If a previously lost item is found, contact the wing FOD prevention monitor to
       update the lost tool report.
       4.7.9. Theft or suspected theft of a tool or CTK will be reported to the tool room or work
       center supervisor immediately, who in turn will report the loss to the flight OIC/NCOIC
       for investigation.
    4.8. Personal Tools: Not authorized in any maintenance area. (Leatherman/Gerber pliers,
    mini-mag, flashlights, etc.).
354FWI 21-135 11 JANUARY 2012                                                                    7


5. Specific FOD Prevention Practices:
   5.1. Air Intake Inspection:
      5.1.1. Anti-personnel guards and bell-mouth screens will be inspected for FOD and
      serviceability prior to engine run. This pre-use inspection will be documented on the
      AFTO Form 781A on a Red X entry. When the inspection is signed off, the run screen
      number will be included in the Corrective Action block. This will be accomplished prior
      to engine start.
      5.1.2. Post engine run (ground or flight) inspections will be accomplished as soon as
      possible, even if the engine is scheduled for removal. Any damage found will be
      reported to the wing FOD prevention monitor.
      5.1.3. A minimum light source for air intake inspections will be an approved high
      intensity flashlight. (Mag-Lite or equivalent).
      5.1.4. Bird strike damage to engines is not considered FOD, but must be investigated and
      documented to preclude the wing from being charged with a FOD incident.
      5.1.5. Any engine damage noted will be reported to the wing FOD prevention monitor or
      alternate.
      5.1.6. An engine intake FOD inspection will be accomplished before and after all engine
      motorings as well as those required by current instructions and technical orders. If the
      aircraft engine(s) is/are being operated by a pilot and the aircraft engine(s) is/are shut
      down for maintenance, an intake inspection does not need to be accomplished if the pilot
      remains in the cockpit. If the aircraft was shut down after taxiing, and the pilot leaves the
      cockpit, an intake inspection must be accomplished prior to subsequent engine start.
   5.2. Safety Pins:
      5.2.1. Aircraft/weapons safety pins will not be left unsecured on aircraft parking
      ramp/movement areas at any time.
      5.2.2. All F-16 aircraft ground safety pins, except SUU/TER pins, will be attached to the
      streamer by a brazed, welded, or silver soldered retaining ring. (Note: If P/N 19-100C
      ring is utilized, brazing requirement is optional). Streamers attached to nose landing
      gear, EPU, and gun pins will be at least 8 but not longer than 12 inches. These pins will
      not have swedged cables attached. The flying squadrons will be responsible for
      maintaining pins in proper configuration while installed on aircraft. Gun and EPU safing
      pin retaining ring part number is IT324, NSN 5300-00-825-3915.
   5.3. Protective Covers.
      5.3.1. Covers (engine intake/exhaust, pitot, and ejection seat(s)) are to be installed
      whether aircraft is sheltered or not.
   5.4. Panel Removal:
      5.4.1. Screw bags or foam templates will be on hand prior to removing any
      screws/fasteners from the aircraft. Screws will be controlled in a screw bag or the foam
      template as removed, not after each panel removal is complete.
8                                                            354FWI 21-135 11 JANUARY 2012


        5.4.2. If a panel is tacked on the aircraft, attaching hardware will be put in a screw bag
        and attached to the outside of the panel. If the panel is not tacked on the aircraft, a screw
        bag must be labeled with aircraft tail number and attached to the removed item.
    5.5. FOD Walks:
        5.5.1. Fighter squadrons and TDY units will ensure FOD walks are accomplished at the
        start of each flying day and during the day as needed in their assigned aircraft parking
        areas, hangaring spaces, and the taxiways adjacent to them. FOD prevention in areas
        assigned to the 168 ARW will be performed IAW 168 Air Refueling Wing Instruction
        21-101.
        5.5.2. End of runway (EOR) crews will conduct a FOD walk of the arm and de-arm areas
        prior to aircraft taxi.
        5.5.3. Maintainers will perform a FOD walk under/around aircraft after they perform
        maintenance or inspections.
        5.5.4. Maintenance squadron will be responsible for FOD walks around their
        maintenance facilities adjacent to aircraft taxiways. Transient Alert will be responsible
        for the areas occupied by transient aircraft.
        5.5.5. The fire chief will ensure ramp access from fire station to main taxiway is
        inspected daily and remains FOD free.
        5.5.6. All daily FOD walks will be called into the MOC upon completion. The MOC
        will ensure all daily FOD walks are complied with in a timely manner.
        5.5.7. See attachment 1 for FOD walk areas of responsibility.
        5.5.8. Airfield Management is responsible for daily inspection of aircraft pavement

     Para 10.8.1.9 for instructions.
     5.8.2. If a foreign object falls into an inaccessible area on a piece of equipment, not
     involving aircraft, the maintenance officer, wing FOD prevention monitor, and QA chief
     inspector will be consulted. If they agree there is no possibility of the item damaging a
     system or other equipment by remaining in or falling out of the unit, the object may
     remain in equipment.
  5.9. ce FOD Alert Procedures:
     5.9.1. The Weather Flight will notify Command Post (CP) and base agencies of an ice
     FOD alert by Joint Environment Tool Kit (JET) or New Tactical Forecast System (N-
     TFS). If maintenance personnel suspect ice FOD conditions, they will inform the
     production superintendent who will confirm and notify the MOC. Ice FOD alerts will be
     sent as observed weather advisories and updated as required.
     5.9.2. F-16 atmospheric conditions for ice FOD are when the temperature is less than 45°
     Fahrenheit with precipitation, standing water, snow, or ice on the ground in the proximity
     of the inlet and/or a dew point between 25° and 35° Fahrenheit with a temperature/dew
     point spread of less than 9 degrees.
         5.9.2.1. Upon notification of an ice FOD alert, only the AMXS commander,
         squadron maintenance officer/superintendent, AMU OIC/NCOIC or Production
         Supervisors will approve maintenance ground runs for F-16 aircraft engines. Engine
         anti-personnel screens will not be used under ice FOD alert or conditions. Instead, a
         qualified individual will be safely positioned to observe for inlet ice buildup. This
         individual will be in clear view of the run supervisor at all times in order to signal for
         immediate shutdown should ice form on the inlet lip.
     5.9.3. After an aircraft engine has been shut down for inlet icing, the observer will
     immediately notify the expediter or production superintendent, who will notify the MOC
     to announce an ice FOD alert.
     5.9.4. The CP will notify the following when an ice FOD alert is initiated or terminated:
         5.9.4.1. Wing or vice wing commander
         5.9.4.2. Operations group commander
         5.9.4.3. Supervisor of flying (SOF)
         5.9.4.4. Control tower
         5.9.4.5. All flying squadrons
         5.9.4.6. MOC
     5.9.5. The SOF will coordinate with tower personnel prior to their issuing clearance to
     taxi during ice FOD alert conditions. Ice FOD alerts will be placed on the Automated
     Terminal Information System (ATIS) as they occur.
10                                                        354FWI 21-135 11 JANUARY 2012


     5.9.6. Squadrons will ensure their pilots are aware of an ice FOD alert prior to flight via
     locally established procedures.
     5.9.7. Air traffic control operations will incorporate the ice FOD alert into the ATIS.
     5.9.8. Fighter squadron commanders will ensure all pilots comply with the engine anti-
     ice procedures found in the following: 1F-16C-1 (Flight Manual); AFI 11-2F-16 Vol.
     3_354 OG Sup 1, F-16 Pilot Operational Procedures; and this instruction. If “inlet icing”
     light illuminates while aircraft is on the ground, a visual inspection must be accomplished
     prior to taxiing or takeoff. If in-flight or ground icing is encountered, pilots will make an
     informational entry in the AFTO Forms 781A. If aircraft icing greater than trace is
     detected after flight, notify production super of the situation and a determination will be
     made by supervision to taxi the aircraft to parking or to shut down and tow to parking.
     Consideration will be given as to the most expeditious manner of engine shut down. Any
     chunking of ice on the aircraft is cause for immediate shut down. For cross-country
     flights, the pilot will brief transient maintenance on the possibility of inlet ice formation
     when the ambient temperature is less than 45° Fahrenheit. If any-time inlet icing has
     occurred, the aircraft will be shut down and the occurrence will be documented in the
     aircraft forms.
  5.10. Airfield Sweeping:
     5.10.1. The Civil Engineer Operations Flight is the office of primary responsibility for
     implementing and following the sweeping plan. Airfield Management is responsible for
     inspecting and reporting of FOD to the Operations Flight. Airfield Management has the
     authority to establish flightline sweeping priorities to facilitate aircraft operations or to
     expedite the cleanup of a serious FOD hazard. The flightline sweepers will follow the
     general guidelines set in the sweeping plan when priorities are not established by Airfield
     Management.
     5.10.2. Flightline sweepers will operate and respond to Airfield Management sweeping
     requests 24 hours per day during the summer months. Airfield Management sweeping
     requests are considered to be a priority. If more than one request is generated, Airfield
     Management will prioritize the requests. The Operations Flight will notify Airfield
     Management when flightline sweepers are down for maintenance or any reason they
     cannot respond to a sweeping request within 15 minutes. Sweeper operators should make
     every effort to cover all surfaces of taxiways and runway, not just yellow taxi lines. The
     following is EAFB sweeper schedule for non-winter conditions:
         5.10.2.1. Every weekday prior to generation of aircraft and after last downs:
            5.10.2.1.1. All primary taxiway centerlines double-pass each side of yellow taxi
            line.
            5.10.2.1.2. All operational airfield vehicle access/entry points
            5.10.2.1.3. F-16 aircraft parking area, including A, B, C, D rows, front and back
            loop parking spots.

             5.10.2.4.2. South Ramp
      5.10.3. Sweeper drivers may exercise discretion and deviate from this plan if they
      discover a potential FOD hazard elsewhere on the airfield that requires immediate
      attention. If the FOD hazard is significant, contact Airfield Management so they can
      temporarily close that area to taxiing aircraft.
      5.10.4. Sweep runway, runway edges and barrier shoulders upon Airfield Management
      request. Exercise caution when operating near barrier cables.
      5.10.5. Maintain a 25-foot distance from parked aircraft and avoid jet blast. When ramps
      are full of aircraft, (i.e., RED FLAG Alaska) skip that area and move to the next available
      area. Return to the skipped area as soon as possible and sweep it accordingly.
   5.11. Failure Analysis Service Technology (FAST) Tests:
      5.11.1. FAST tests will be utilized to determine the cause of significant engine blade
      damage.
