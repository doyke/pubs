                                           GENERAL

1.1. Conducting Evaluations. All evaluations are conducted in accordance with the provisions
of AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, and this instruction.
1.2. Procedures:
   1.2.1. Flight examiners (FE) will use the evaluation criteria contained in this instruction for
   conducting flight and emergency procedure evaluations (EPE). To ensure standard and
   objective evaluations, FEs must become thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation
   criteria.
   1.2.2. Unless specified, the examinee will fly in the seat that best enables the FE to conduct a
   thorough evaluation. The FE normally occupies the left seat during instructor evaluations and
   the right seat for all other types of evaluations.
   1.2.3. Prior to the flight, the FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and
   how it will be conducted. The examinee accomplishes required flight planning during the
   evaluation and furnishes the FE a copy of necessary mission data, mission materials, and
   maps (as required).
   1.2.4. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. Debriefs include the
   examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified),
   and any required additional training. A squadron supervisor must be debriefed on all
   evaluations. Additionally, a squadron supervisor must attend the debrief if the overall grade
   is Qualification Level 3 (Q-3).
   1.2.5. To initially qualify as an instructor, a pilot must successfully complete a dedicated
   initial instructor evaluation. Subsequently, crewmembers designated as instructors will be
   evaluated on their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations. FEs will act as a student
   for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability.
1.3. Grading Instructions:
   1.3.1. Tolerances in performance parameters are based on conditions of smooth air and a
   stable aircraft. Momentary deviations from tolerances will not be considered in grading,
   provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not
   jeopardize flying safety. Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
   1.3.2. FEs will use the grading criteria in paragraph 1.3.5 and Table 3.1 to determine
   individual area grades. When individual areas are performed well above the grading criteria
   standards, then make an appropriate comment stating performance and/or instruction was
   commendable in the Examiner’s Remarks in the Comments block of the AF Form 8,
   Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, or AF Form 8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification
   (Multiple Aircraft). FE judgment must be exercised when the evaluation criterion is
   subjective or the specific situation is not covered.

     1.3.3. Derive the overall flight evaluation grade (Q-1, Q-2, or Q-3) from the area grades,
     based on a composite for the observed events and tasks, according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2,
     Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation Program, this instruction and FE judgment.
     1.3.4. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the examinee to successfully
     achieve mission objectives. If the examinee receives an unqualified grade in any critical area,
     the overall grade for the evaluation will be unqualified (Q-3). Critical areas are identified by
     "Critical" in the area title in Chapter 3. Grade critical areas as "Q" or "U."
     1.3.5. The general evaluation criteria in Table 1.1 apply during all phases of flight (except
     for specific events noted in Table 3.1).

1.4. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). FEs will administer oral EPEs on the ground.
Include a sampling of emergency procedures resolved to a logical conclusion.
     1.4.1. The FE will include an evaluation of the following items on the EPE:
        1.4.1.1. General knowledge, including aircraft systems, operating procedures, and the
        National Airspace System (NAS).
        1.4.1.2. Emergency procedures (evaluate at least one).
        1.4.1.3. Alternate or divert airfields.
     1.4.2. Units will not permit examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade (Q-3) because
     of an unsatisfactory EPE to fly in any aircrew position until the examinee completes a
     successful reevaluation.
     1.4.3. For each EPE graded ―qualified with additional training required,‖ the FE will indicate
     whether the additional training must be accomplished before the next flight.
1.5. Completion of AF Form 8 or AF Form 8A. Record aircrew member qualifications on the
AF Form 8 or AF Form 8A, in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 2. (Exception: Record
nonrated pilot qualifications on a temporary certificate of evaluation kept in the pilot’s training
folder.)
     1.5.1. When an evaluation in one aircraft satisfies the evaluations requirements in another
     aircraft, include a comment stating so in the examiner’s remarks on an AF Form 8 or AF
     Form 8A.
AFI11-2T-41-51-52-53V2 12 MARCH 2010                                                         5


   1.5.2. With the exception of restrictions and exceptionally qualified designation (if used),
   place all comments on the reverse side of the AF Form 8 or AF Form 8A.
1.6. Waivers. Each MAJCOM director of operations is the waiver authority for this instruction.
Submit waiver requests in message or memorandum format.

                                             Chapter 2

                               EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General. There are five types of evaluations: qualification (QUAL), mission (MSN),
instructor (INSTR), instrument (INSTM) (ANG only), and SPOT. Evaluations include requisites
and required areas. Table 2.1 indicates when a requisite is required (R) for an evaluation. Table
2.2 prescribes required areas that must be included in the flight evaluation profile. Evaluation
areas are aligned under the type of evaluation.
     2.1.1. Alternative Evaluation Methods. Alternate evaluation methods are not authorized.
     If the FE determines one or more of the required items cannot be adequately evaluated, the
     examinee must complete an additional flight to complete the evaluation.
     2.1.2. Publications Check. The FE will check these publications during the evaluation:
        2.1.2.1. For T-41 evaluations: TO 1T-41D-1CL-1, Pilot’s Abbreviated Flight Crew
        Checklist, USAF Series T-41D Aircraft; and the local in-flight guide (IFG).
        2.1.2.2. For T-51 evaluations: TO 1T-51A-1CL-1, Pilots’ Abbreviated Flight Manual
        Checklist, USAF, T-51A Series Aircraft, and the local IFG.
        2.1.2.3. For T-52 evaluations: TO 1T-52A-1CL-1, Pilot’s Abbreviated Flight Crew
        Checklist, USAF Series T-52A Aircraft, and the local IFG.
        2.1.2.4. For T-53 evaluations: TO 1T-53A-1CL-1, Pilot’s Abbreviated Flight Crew
        Checklist, USAF Series T-53 Aircraft, and the local IFG.
        2.1.2.5. For pilots qualified in multiple aircraft, check each set of publications.
2.2. Requisites. Table 2.1 indicates the minimum requisites for each type of evaluation. When
periodic evaluations are combined, accomplish all requisites for each evaluation and document in
the ground phase section of AF Form 8 or AF Form 8A. For each required exam, units may
combine questions covering multiple aircraft into a single test.

2.3. Pilot Evaluations. All pilot evaluations are qualification evaluations. The examinee briefs
the sortie profile and flies from the left seat. Include all required (R) areas from Table 2.2 in the
flight evaluation profile. Fly a normal departure followed by maneuvers (areas 22–24 and 26–27)
in the local training area. The examinee will perform each type of landing. A QUAL evaluation
in the DA20, T-41, T-51, T-52, or T-53 satisfies the periodic QUAL evaluation requirements for
the other aircraft so that only one periodic QUAL evaluation is required.
2.4. Instructor Pilot Evaluations. Following the initial MSN/INSTR evaluation, all periodic
instructor pilot (IP) evaluations are combined MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluations to evaluate
both proficiency and instructor ability. The examinee briefs the sortie profile and flies from the
right seat. Include all required areas from Table 2.2 in the flight evaluation profile. Accomplish a
normal departure followed by area maneuvers in the local training area. The examinee will
perform each type of landing. The examiner will attempt at least two area maneuvers and one
landing for the examinee to instruct and evaluate. A MSN evaluation in the T-41, T-51, T-52, or
T-53 satisfies the periodic MSN evaluation requirements for the other aircraft so that only one
periodic MSN evaluation is required.

Notes:
1. Loss of control effectiveness is indicated by an uncontrolled nose drop, roll, or yaw. In the T-
52, the first aerodynamic indication of a stall includes aircraft buffet or loss of control
effectiveness, whichever occurs first.
2. Air National Guard only.
