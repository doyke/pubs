Introduction _______________________________________________ i

       Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Qualification Training Package (QTP) contains
modules on most of the core tasks identified in the 4R0X1C STS. This QTP is
designed to enhance 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level OJT of MRI personnel. This QTP is
intended to be used by trainees, trainers, supervisors, and task certifiers. This
package is available on computer disk, so you may reproduce copies as necessary;
however, before initiating any training you should review your responsibilities--as a
supervisor/trainer--for conducting on-the-job training (OJT) per AFI 36-2201,
Developing, Managing, and Conducting Training.

        QTPs provide continuity to the trainee’s upgrade training. The QTP modules
were written to assist you in preparing for and conducting training. You must use the
QTP modules for training when either: 1) the STS task is a core task (minimum
qualification for the specialty); or 2) you have identified the STS task as a
requirement of the trainee’s job. Each module segments the major tasks into
teachable elements. Your goal is to provide enough training and guidance so trainees
can do all task related steps, without assistance, and produce a scan that meets local
requirements for speed and image quality. QTPs also aid OJT task certifiers in
evaluating the trainees demonstrated performance. If you have local training
requirements not covered by a QTP module you should develop “steps in
performance” and “performance checklists” that support and standardize those tasks.
Accompanying this QTP is a qualification training progress record.

     This QTP record serves as a document to record the date trainee completes each
module. All persons in qualification/upgrade training must have this QTP progress
record filed in their OJT folder. Use and annotation of this progress record is similar
to current OJT documentation. When you are satisfied the trainee meets standards, as
prescribed in the QTP performance checklist, you must document and initial each task
completion date in column 2B of the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and the “date
completed” column in the QTP progress record. If a person is being recertified on a
task that is supported by a QTP you must use that module to complete the
recertification process. It is not necessary to produce multiple hard copies of the QTP
modules; however, your workcenter requirements may require additional copies.
Regardless, you should file the QTPs in an accessible location.

     Typically, you will manage each module by first training the tasks and then,
evaluating performance. Your local steps in performance may vary from the method
listed in the QTP module. If this is the case, you are authorized to make changes to
the first half of each module, (i.e. steps in task performance); however, the
“performance checklist” is considered a standard and can not be altered. You may
train the QTP modules in any sequence; however, when conducting training use an
organized and methodical approach. This will reduce your training time and enhance
your efforts.

        When beginning any training process you should first, review the procedures
in each module with the trainee. Second, direct the trainee to review the training
references listed to prepare for task performance. Third, go through the steps in task
Introduction ______________________________________________ ii

performance with the trainee, allowing enough time to adequately train each step
(some modules may take longer to teach). Forth, evaluate the trainees work at each
critical step--using the performance checklist at this point will be helpful. Fifth,
evaluate the trainee’s performance and provide feedback on any areas for
improvement. Finally, when the trainee has successfully completed the task you must
document and initial both the STS and the QTP progress record. If the trainee does
not accomplish the module, conduct follow-up instruction until the trainee
successfully completes the task.

         The QTP project goal of the 381st Training Squadron, Sheppard AFB TX, is
to publish a useable document for trainers and trainees. You are encouraged to send
in changes or revisions to the QTP. A corrections/improvements letter is located on
the last page of this QTP.

service in this publication is for informational purposes only and does not imply
