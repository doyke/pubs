           1.7.2.1. The purpose of the event summary sheet is to accurately record the incidents
           in which a defibrillator was utilized and to determine the events that transpired during
           the incident. This completed form will be maintained by the PAD Site Coordinator.
2. RESPONSE PLAN: All units and organizations participating in the KMC PAD Program
will devise response plans that describe the method of response in the event of a suspected acute
cardiac event.
   2.1. The response plan will use the format as outlined in the “Annual Update of Unit Public
   Access Defibrillation (PAD) Program Response Plan” Memoranda (Attachment 2).
3. EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT
   3.1. Medical Equipment Management Office:
       3.1.1. All PAD Program AEDs will be gained in Defense Medical Logistics Standard
       Support (DMLSS) system and will be assigned an Equipment Control Number (ECN).
       The nomenclature must be Public Access Defibrillator.
       3.1.2. AEDs already employed on the base and not on DMLSS system records must be
       gained using an Equipment Gain transaction and the aforementioned device codes.
       3.1.3. Annually, MEMO will receive “Annual Update of Unit Public Access
       Defibrillation (PAD) Program Response Plan” Memoranda (Attachment 2) from the
       PAD Medical Director. These memoranda will confirm the location of AEDs on the
       installation.
       3.1.4. Performs a physical inventory of MEMO controlled property annually or more
       often if the MDG Commander, Medical Logistics Flight Commander, or MEMO
       determines it to be necessary.
   3.2. Local Biomedical Equipment Technicians (BMETs):
       3.2.1. Will be appointed in writing by the MDG Commander to maintain an accurate
       inventory of PAD program devices throughout the installation. They are the focal point of
       maintenance and management of the PAD program assets.
       3.2.2. Accurately record the serial number, manufacturer, and common model (e.g.,
       Medtronic Lifepak 1000) during the initial inspection process.
6                                                         RAMSTEINABI41-101 2 MAY 2011


       3.2.3. Perform annual preventive maintenance on all PAD program devices in
       accordance with manufacturer’s specifications and guidelines.
       3.2.4. Annotate all maintenance, scheduled and unscheduled, in the DMLSS system.
    3.3. Maintenance.
       3.3.1. Units are responsible for reporting non-operational PADs to local BMETs (479-
       2438). If a device is reported as non-operational, local BMETs will assess the status of
       the device.
          3.3.1.1. If it is determined that the fault is the result of operator error, the BMET will
          notify the PAD Program Training Coordinator of the possible need for refresher
          training. Any calls of this nature will be coded as a “no problem found” work order
          in the DMLSS system to track any trends.
          3.3.1.2. If the fault is not operator error and the unit is still under warranty, the
          BMET will coordinate with the manufacturer, or their designated dealer, to return the
          unit for repair or replacement.
              3.3.1.2.1. If it is not operator error, MEMO must be notified to ensure that the
              proper DMLSS system transactions are completed.
          3.3.1.3. If the unit is no longer under warranty, local BMETs must determine if the
          unit can be repaired locally or if the device should be sent to the manufacturer.
              3.3.1.3.1. If a unit’s PAD device is removed from the unit for maintenance or
              repair, a temporary “loaner” AED will be made available to the unit by the MDG
              through the BMET.
              3.3.1.3.2. All costs associated with the repair will be borne by the unit bearing the
              PAD account.
              3.3.1.3.3. All actions and costs will be recorded in the DMLSS system
              3.3.1.3.4. In accordance with the Safe Medical Device Act, all equipment errors
              must be reported to the FDA. The reporting mechanism is available on the
              Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) website (http://www.ecri.org) and is
              included as part of the Air Force-wide subscription managed by the Air Force
              Medical Logistics Office. Once the online form is completed by MEMO, the
              information will be forwarded by MEMO to the FDA and compiled for analysis
              and tracking.
          3.3.1.4. If for some reason a PAD malfunctions at any time during use, the following
          procedures will be followed:
              3.3.1.4.1. Do not move the equipment or otherwise disturb the equipment’s
              position at time of malfunction (unless safety is a concern). However, if attached
              to a patient, detach the PAD.
              3.3.1.4.2. Leave all knobs, switches, cables, and other equipment parts in their
              exact position at the time of malfunction. Do not change any settings and do not
              discard any patient electrode pads.
              3.3.1.4.3. Call BMET immediately at the MERC at 479-2438 to report the failure.
RAMSTEINABI41-101 2 MAY 2011                                                                  7


4. UNIT PROCUREMENT OF AED(S)
  4.1. Units must have approval by the PAD Medical Director before procuring an AED(s).
  written request will be coordinated between the unit’s PAD Site Coordinator, the PAD
  Program Training Coordinator, and the BMET PAD Representative prior to purchase
  (Attachment 5). Request approvals will be managed as outlined in paragraph 1.4.9.
  4.2. Equipment will be managed as outlined in section 3.
5. QUALITY ASSURANCE.
  5.1. After an AED has been employed, the unit PAD Site Coordinator will notify the PAD
  Medical Director in accordance with paragraph 1.6.8.
  5.2. The unit site coordinator or designee will forward all Event Summary Sheets to the PAD
  Medical Director or designee within 24 hours for review.
  5.3. The PAD Medical Director or designee will review all event summary sheets to assess
  quality of care, to ensure that procedures were followed, and to provide individual units with
  appropriate feedback.
