                                             Chapter 1

                                         INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. This instruction provides guidance for commanders to operate their ranges safely,
effectively, and efficiently to meet operational needs while taking appropriate account of
potential effects on the environment and the surrounding communities.
1.2. Scope. This instruction applies to all USAF-operated ranges except Space Launch Ranges
and those dedicated to small arms training addressed in AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program.
Outside the United States, USAF-operated ranges will comply with this instruction, DoDD
4715.12, Environmental and Explosives Safety Management on Operational Ranges Outside the
United States or host-nation rules whichever is more restrictive. On non-USAF operated ranges,
the range user will confirm suitability of weapons delivery or ordnance use with the range
operator and comply with this instruction, other service published procedures or host-nation
restrictions, whichever is more restrictive.
1.3. Description of Ranges. A range is an area established for operations, training, research
and development, and test and evaluation of military systems, personnel, tactics, munitions, and
explosives.
     1.3.1. Primary Training Range (PTR). PTRs are normally located in close proximity to their
     primary users, accommodate basic to intermediate air-to-surface, electronic combat (EC), or
     air-to-air training and consist of a limited land area (typically 5,000-100,000 acres). Typical
     PTRs contain target arrays, threat simulators, and weapons scoring systems and provide
     Class A, B, C and/or D service. (See paragraph 1.4.6).
     1.3.1. (AFSOC) Primary Training Ranges (PTR) are not designed to support test activities.
     Exceptions may be made IAW paragraph 4.1.3. The Melrose Air Force Range (MAFR)
     Range Operating Authority (ROA) will forward all test activity requests to Headquarters Air
     Force Special Operations Command (HQ AFSOC)/A3AR.
     1.3.2. Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB). DoDD 3200.11, Major Range and
     Test Facility Base (MRTFB) and AFI 99-109, Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB)
     Test and Evaluation Resource Planning, govern specific DoD Test & Evaluation activities.
     Although MRTFB activities function primarily to enable DoD test and evaluation support
     missions, they may also perform other missions (operations, training, R&D, etc.). USAF
     MRTFB activities include: The Air Force Flight Test Center (Edwards AFB); the Air
     Armament Center (Eglin AFB); the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR); the Utah Test
     and Training Range (UTTR); the 30th Space Wing; and the 45th Space Wing.
1.4. Range Operations and Classifications. The land or sea encompassed within the Danger
Area or underlying an air-to-air range used for actual weapon employment must be protected by
purchase, lease, or other means to ensure the safety of personnel, structures, and the public from
expended weapons, laser and electromagnetic emissions, and target debris.
     1.4.1. Air-to-Surface. Air-to-Surface ranges may require a substantial amount of range space
     and a sophisticated infrastructure to support complex, multi-aircraft operations; air-to-surface
     and cruise missile employment; aeronautical system testing; unmanned vehicles; and
     battlefield operations. This infrastructure may include high fidelity threat simulators, visual
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                              7


  threat simulators, scoring capabilities, realistic target arrays, command and control systems,
  communication networks, data display/processing capabilities, instrumentation/debrief
  systems, flight termination systems, and flight hazard analysis/strike prediction capability.
  1.4.2. Electronic Combat Range (ECR)/Electronic Scoring Site (ESS). ECRs/ESSs provide a
  simulated electronic threat environment for aircrew combat training. ECR/ESS facilities and
  equipment can be located at air-to-air or air-to-surface ranges, under or near a Military
  Training Route (MTR) or a Military Operations Area (MOA), or outside of USAF ranges and
  Special Use Airspace (SUA).
  1.4.3. Surface-to-Air. Surface-to-Air operations cover a wide range of mission requirements.
  Ranges that support, for example, endo-atmospheric and exo-atmospheric missile intercepts,
  aeronautical system testing, and ballistic missiles require a substantial amount of range space
  and a sophisticated range infrastructure. This infrastructure may include high fidelity
  simulators, visual simulators, end-game scoring capabilities, command and control systems,
  communication networks, data display/processing capabilities, instrumentation systems,
  flight termination systems, and flight hazard analysis/strike prediction capability.
  1.4.4. Air-to-Air. Air-to-Air operations cover a wide range of mission requirements. Ranges
  that support, for example, air-to-air operations involving simulated and actual employment of
  missiles, air-to-air gunnery, aeronautical system testing, unmanned vehicles, and EC require
  a substantial amount of range space and a sophisticated range infrastructure. This
  infrastructure may include high fidelity simulators, visual simulators, end-game scoring
  capabilities, command and control systems, communications networks, data
  display/processing capabilities, instrumentation systems, flight termination systems, and
  flight hazard analysis/strike prediction capability.
     1.4.4.1. Live Air-to-Air Gunnery Operations. Towed targets and drones are used for live
     air-to-air gunnery operations. The aircraft performance capabilities and the appropriate
     munitions ballistic tables determine the airspace and surface area required for safe
     accomplishment.
  1.4.5. Air Combat Training System (ACTS). ACTS ranges are instrumented air-to-air or air-
  to-ground ranges that allow near real-time observation and assessment or recording and
  playback.
     1.4.5.1. Tethered flight instrumentation range systems provide Time-Space-Position-
     Information (TSPI) and model weapons impact or flyout for aircrew kill notification
     using ground-based computers, towers, and communications relays and aircraft pods or
     internal avionics.
     1.4.5.2. Rangeless / untethered flight instrumentation range systems use autonomous
     pods, aircraft avionics or recording devices of participating aircraft to provide capabilities
     similar to a tethered system. Pod-to-Pod or aircraft datalinks can relay kill predictions to
     participating aircraft for near-real time kill notification.
  1.4.6. USAF Range Classifications/Types of Service.
     1.4.6.1. Class A: A manned, ground-scoring capable range with a Range Control Officer
     (RCO) present on range and controlling aircraft operations.

        1.4.6.2. Class B. A manned or unmanned, ground-scoring capable range where no RCO
        is present on range for controlling aircraft operations. (Note: Class B ranges include
        ranges where a remotely sited RCO/RSO actively controls aircraft operations)
        1.4.6.3. Class C. An unmanned range with no scoring and no RCO control of aircraft.
        1.4.6.4. Class D. An instrumented air-to-air range monitored by a Range Training
        Officer (RTO) to facilitate training.
1.5. Exceptions. Exceptions to this instruction may be granted by AF/A3O-AR. The ROA will
monitor implementation and request a review of the exception anytime the circumstances that
prompted or impact the request change substantially. Granted exceptions may continue pending
review if the change in circumstances does not involve safety.
     1.5.1. Exemptions. An exemption is a permanent exception to a specific requirement of this
     instruction and will only be granted when the conditions cannot be alleviated and the
     increased risk is acceptable. ROAs will internally review exemptions every five years to
     validate continued need for the exception.
     1.5.2. Waivers. A waiver is a temporary exception and will include a plan to alleviate the
     condition. Waivers expire one year after approval or when the condition is alleviated,
     whichever occurs first.
     1.5.3. As a minimum, a request for Exemption, Waiver or Review will include the
     following:
        1.5.3.1. Range name, location, ROA and a point-of-contact.
        1.5.3.2. Requested exception to specific paragraph of this instruction.

                                     RANGE PLANNING

3.1. Planning for Ranges. Accomplish range planning to ensure future training and testing
needs are met. When planning indicates that a major change is required, the Major Actions
Planning Process must be followed as outlined in paragraph 3.3.
3.2. Comprehensive Range Planning. Comprehensive Range Planning is accomplished to
identify shortfalls in current and projected capabilities and guide sustainable range development
to close the shortfalls. A hierarchy of plans addressing the ten investment areas for ranges will
guide future development while identifying and integrating range requirements. The detailed
planning cycle timeline is published in the Air Force Ranges and Airspace Strategic Vision.
   3.2.1. Air Force Ranges and Airspace Strategic Vision. AF/A3O-AR will publish an AF
   Ranges and Airspace Strategic Vision to identify service-wide needs, consolidate the inputs
   of the MAJCOMs, CTRs, TIPP and other services and agencies as applicable and guide
   MAJCOM- and range-level planning. AF/A3O-AR will initiate a review process for the AF
   Ranges and Airspace Strategic Vision document every four years in conjunction with the
   development and release of the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR).
   3.2.2. AF/A3O-AR participates in two planning forums that provide unique test and training
   community inputs to The AF Ranges and Airspace Strategic Vision.
       3.2.2.1. Combat Training Range (CTR) Executive Reviews. HQ ACC/A3A, with the
       assistance of AF/A3O-AR, SAF/AQPW, AAC/WMR and 84th CBSG, will conduct
       semi-annual executive-level reviews of all CTR programs covered by PMD 0111(35)/PE
       0604735F/0207429F Air Combat Training Systems. ACC, AETC, AFRC, AFSOC, ANG,
       PACAF, and USAFE will send senior voting representatives (normally O-6) to the CTR
       Executive Reviews. AF/A3O-AR, AAC/WMR, 84th CBSG, and SAF/AQPW participate
       as non-voting members of the CTR Executive Reviews. The CTR Executive Reviews
       provide a forum to discuss ongoing programs, advocate new requirements, and vote on
       funding priorities. The voting members (as delegated by their parent MAJCOMs) have
       approval authority on CTR funding allocations and program validation. They also
       provide requirements direction to AAC/WMR, SAF/AQPW, and 84th CBSG. ACC/A3A,
       in conjunction with the user, AAC/WMR, and 84th CBSG prepares the necessary
       requirements documentation to implement user-prioritized programs. Day-to-day "user"
       management of CTR programs is the responsibility of ACC/A3A per the Seven-
       Command CTR Charter and the "total force" concept.
           3.2.2.1.1. CTR Program/Procurement of Instrumentation, Threat Systems, and
           Test/Training Range Engineering Development. CTRs need improvements to
           increase combat realism, aid tactics development, and enhance day-to-day training.
           This includes realistic simulations of the projected threat environment, as well as
           instrumentation for: readiness training, Operational Test & Evaluation (OT&E),
           tactics development and evaluation, command and control, safety, and real-time flight
           monitoring. These systems provide precise monitoring, reconstruction, and debriefing
           of aircrews after single and multiple aircraft training missions, including reaction to
22                                            AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


        air defense threats and live or simulated ordnance exchanges. A continuous
        modernization program is required to ensure CTRs meet these requirements.
        3.2.2.1.2. Range Improvement Requirements. HQ ACC/A3A is the lead agency for
        range improvement requirements representing AETC, AFRC, AFSOC, ANG,
        PACAF, and USAFE. AMC will develop Mobility Air Forces (MAF) requirements
        and coordinate with the CTR. AFOTEC will coordinate on Combat Air Forces (CAF)
        requirements that need an OT&E input or may effect OT&E as well as Development
        Test and Evaluation (DT&E), Force Development Evaluation (FDE), JT&E, and
        Expeditionary Force Experiments (EFX). The members of the CTR Executive
        Reviews, AAC/WMR, 84th CBSG, and the test community should attempt to
        combine requirements and form partnerships to seek procurement synergy.
        3.2.2.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) Range Users Conference. The ROA will hold an
        annual "range users" conference to ensure user’s training requirements are identified.
        Conference attendees should include at a minimum: the RM, OSS, Intelligence, and
        Group Weapons and Tactics representative or equivalent, and representation by each
        range user. Examples of topics to address are: range safety, operating procedures,
        scheduling, targets and target sets, threats, range clean-up, weapons danger zones,
        scoring, air to ground integration operations, ground maneuver and joint special
        operations forces (SOF) requirements. The minutes will be signed by the ROA and
        an electronic copy sent to HQ AFSOC/A3AR.
        3.2.2.1.4. (Added-AFSOC) HQ AFSOC/A3A will advise ROA of range-related
        inputs and issues derived from the ACC Realistic Training Review Board (RTRB).
        The RTRB receives training requirement feedback from Combatant Command and
        Operational Wings. These inputs are presented for possible inclusion in the
        respective Comprehensive Range Plans and Program Objective Memorandum (POM)
        submissions.
     3.2.2.2. Test Investment Planning and Programming (TIPP) Process. Test infrastructure
     is a key contributor to the test process. AFPD 99-1 states, ―The Air Force will operate,
     maintain, and improve test and evaluation facilities, including the Major Range and Test
     Facility Base (MRTFB) … to support US Air Force, Department of Defense, and other
     valid user requirements. In addition, the Air Force will continually evaluate test
     infrastructure requirements and capabilities to ensure essential Air Force needs are met,
     and to avoid unnecessary duplication and expense of excess test resources.‖
        3.2.2.2.1. The TIPP process governs all investments in the Air Force's test and
        evaluation infrastructure within the AF Improvement and Modernization (I&M)
        program elements (Major Test and Evaluation Investment and Threat Simulator
        Development) and identifies potential joint Service investment for funding under the
        Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP). TIPP is used to identify
        the most critical shortfalls in the test and evaluation community, develop alternatives
        to solve them, and deliver a corporate investment plan for budgeting and funding
        through the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process. HQ
        AFMC/A3 manages the Air Force TIPP process to identify test resource investments
        needed to support military systems testing. Those investments that have possible
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                         23


         multi-Service applicability may be referred to the CTEIP for funding IAW AFI 99-
         109.
  3.2.3. MAJCOM Ranges and Airspace Roadmaps. MAJCOMs will produce a Ranges and
  Airspace Roadmap approved by AF/A3O-AR. Each roadmap should have a ten-year
  planning horizon, support the Air Force Ranges and Airspace Strategic Vision, focus on the
  ten investment areas described in paragraph 3.2.4.1.1 and compare current and future mission
  needs against the current range capabilities to identify shortfalls. It will describe the
  MAJCOM vision for the future and the strategies to attain that vision. The roadmap will also
  provide tailored planning direction to each range to guide their comprehensive range
  planning. Roadmap development provides an opportunity for all MAJCOM organizations
  and staff to provide inputs, coordinate actions within the command and across the MAJCOM
  staff. MAJCOMs will coordinate the plan with all other MAJCOMs that it supports on its
  ranges to ensure their needs and concerns are addressed.
  3.2.4. Comprehensive Range Plans (CRPs). Each ROA will maintain a CRP for coherent and
  sustainable development that considers the interests of all organizations supporting or using
  the range. CRPs will be reviewed bi-annually and revised at least every four years or
  whenever significant changes occur. MAJCOMs will review and approve all CRPs. CRPs for
  new ranges require additional approval of AF/A3O-AR (and AF/TE, for test and evaluation
  ranges).
  3.2.4. (AFSOC) The ROA is the installation OPR for the CRP and will review and/or
  update the CRP annually. Development and review of the CRP should involve all
  stakeholders IAW paragraphs 9.1.1. and 9.1.2. HQ AFSOC/A3A is the AFSOC OPR for
  CRP and will coordinate MAJCOM review prior to approval. Send the revised CRP to HQ
  AFSOC/A3A for review and coordination and command approval prior to implementing any
  action.
     3.2.4.1. CRP Format. Each plan will consolidate the individual planning of all range
     support organizations. Each plan will include an executive summary, address the ten
     range investment areas and assess the situation, communicate a vision and formulate a
     strategy.
     3.2.4.1. (AFSOC) Include a summary of factors affecting unrestricted use of the range
     and suggested solutions, including potential Readiness and Environmental Protection
     Initiative proposals. Include these factors in the Range Readiness Report IAW paragraph
     6.6.. Ensure environmental funding requirements are identified IAW paragraph 9.4.
         3.2.4.1.1. Range Investment Areas. The main body of the plan is written for the
         technical person, details analysis of the investment areas and validates the
         requirements in support of the vision for the range. It culminates in a time-phased
         investment program to support each specific range objective to enable summarizing
         investments by FY, investment area and objective to support resource programming.
         Over time, strategy execution will be measured against the plan and documented in
         subsequent revisions to the CRP. The ten investment areas below are detailed in the
         Range and Airspace Strategic Vision published by AF/A3O-AR
             3.2.4.1.1.1. Land. This investment area includes all surface land and water areas
             required for the range that the military owns, leases or controls by easement. It
24                                     AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


     also includes land or water areas surrounding the range or underlying military
     airspace that may be affected by range use.
     3.2.4.1.1.2. Airspace. This investment area addresses all airspace controlled by
     the ROA to include SUA. Airspace considerations include proximity to user
     airfields, airspace volume and attributes and the utilization as a function of time.
     Other considerations include FAA operating relationships and interface with the
     National Airspace System (NAS).
     3.2.4.1.1.3. Environmental. This investment area includes natural infrastructure
     on the range and its short- and long-term effect on the military value of the range.
     Management practices and implementation of applicable regulations and policy
     are included when they interface with military operations.
     3.2.4.1.1.4. Unexploded Ordnance/Range Debris. This investment area addresses
     the management of Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard
     (MPPEH) and other range debris on operational ranges. It includes a program to
     remove such material and maintain records of use and removal IAW AFMAN 33-
     363. Also included are efforts to reduce levels of debris and enhance clearance
     practices.
     3.2.4.1.1.5. Physical Plant. This investment area involves infrastructure
     requirements primarily dealing with Civil Engineering and includes the
     construction, upgrade and maintenance of facilities, roads, land, and utilities such
     as water, power, gas, sewage, and drainage.
     3.2.4.1.1.6. Scoring and Feedback Systems. This investment area includes Air-to-
     Surface scoring systems, air combat mission record and replay capabilities, and

     support test activities.
     3.2.4.1.1.7. Communications Systems. This investment area includes Ground-Air
     and point-to-point systems and support on the ranges and communications
     backbones such as microwave and fiber systems. Also covered are information
     protection requirements (such as encryption) and radio, data link, and
     instrumentation frequency management.
     3.2.4.1.1.8. Integrated Air Defense/Counter-air Defense Systems. This
     investment area covers types and quantities of EC equipment, Information
     Warfare and Information Operations assets, Space Warfare and Low Observable
     resources, and the uses of expendables (chaff and flares) and towed decoys.
     3.2.4.1.1.9. Targets and Target Arrays. This investment area addresses the types
     and quantities of surface and aerial targets including conventional, strafe, urban
     warfare and buried targets in configurations for covered, concealed, deceived,
     hardened, mobile and moving targets.
     3.2.4.1.1.10. Management. This investment area addresses overarching systemic
     or institutional practices and generally covers procedures and administration. This
     area includes such activities as programming and supervision as well as
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                               25


             scheduling issues, the modernization planning process, and reducing duplication
             of effort among the ranges. Also included are range functions not in the other
             investment areas such as mission control and control/scheduling centers, safety,
             noise management and public affairs. The management of the ranges
             encroachment and sustainability programs.
          3.2.4.1.2. Situation. In this section, describe the current state of the ranges and
          airspace and any funded improvements. Provide a brief summary of utilization and
          maintenance status and a current baseline assessment for each investment area. The
          region of influence of the range and airspace operations will be defined and analyzed
          to identify the current and projected interface between the community and operations,
          and highlight encroachment and sustainability issues. This discussion will conclude
          with an analysis of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats.
          3.2.4.1.3. Vision. In this section, identify future capabilities and priorities directed by
          higher level plans anticipated to accommodate changing missions, modified tactics
          and new weapons systems. This section should include a vision statement that
          succinctly captures an image of the future we seek to create. Specific thrusts will be
          captured and organized into overarching goals.
          3.2.4.1.4. Strategy. Formulate a strategy that will provide the specific direction to
          attain the Vision and over-arching Goals. The service-level and MAJCOM-level
          plans will include guidance to the Vision section for the subordinate levels. The CRPs
          will have specific objectives in each of the investment areas to support the goals. This
          section will include a management approach for accomplishing and overseeing
          progress.
          3.2.4.1.5. CRP Supporting Documents. Since the CRP is the composite analysis of
          numerous specialized documents it is vital that these supporting documents be readily
          available and preserved for the life of the range. All referenced documents will be
          maintained in a document management system available to all range staff and
          available electronically. Civil Engineering is responsible for maintaining all records
          related to land/water area deeds, leases, permits, easements, etc. Graphical data sets
          used to produce graphics and support analyses will be preserved and continuously
          updated in a Geographic Information System that is available to all range staff.
          3.2.4.1.5. (AFSOC) Submit documents supporting the CRP to HQ AFSOC/A3A for
          appropriate headquarters coordination/review; HQ AFSOC/A7A will coordinate with
          HQ AFSOC/A3A on documents relating to the range; reference supporting plans by
          title and date in the CRP. Supporting plans should address, but are not limited to
          Emergency Management, Integrated Natural and Cultural Resource Management
          plans, Wildland Fire Management, BASH, etc. Supporting documents approved for
          release by the OPR shall be electronically attached to the CRP and hosted on AFSOC
          Portal.
3.3. Major Actions Planning Process. Major actions to establish, change use of, modify, or
delete test/training space (including ranges or permanent airspace), except those purely
administrative in nature, are reviewed by units, MAJCOMs, and HQ USAF via the Test/Training
Space Needs Statement (T/TSNS) process detailed in AFI 13-201.
26                                             AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


  3.3.1. Development of the Proposals. Proposal development will comply with the National
  Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4347. Proposals can consider
  single (i.e. distinct) actions or numerous actions covered by an overarching plan (i.e.,
  Comprehensive Range Plans). NEPA requires proponents for all major federal projects to
  consider environmental impacts, prior to making an irrevocable or irretrievable commitment
  of resources (personnel, facilities or dollars). While NEPA does not require the decision-
  maker to choose the most environmentally advantageous alternative, it does require the
  decision-maker to make an informed decision and consider all potential impacts. Refer to
  AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process, as promulgated at 32 CFR Part
  989, for specific guidance. Range specific planning factors are listed on the RMAST wiki
  website under Range Construction and Maintenance.
  3.3.2. Airspace Establishment and Land Acquisition.
     3.3.2.1. Airspace. Before establishing a need for new airspace, proponents must ensure
     they comply with AFI 13-201, AFI 32-7061, and applicable FAA Orders & Directives.
     3.3.2.2. Land. Land acquisitions require lead times as long as 7 years. Proponents need
     to work through the Base Civil Engineer with the Unit/MAJCOM, SAF/IEI, and the AF
     Real Property Agency (AFRPA) to acquire land IAW AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real
     Property. Factors to be examined when considering the acquisition of land include
     confirmation that the proposal cannot be accommodated within or by modifying existing
     areas, and issues associated with procuring private land or withdrawing federal lands. The
     Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, and Title 43, United States Code,
     Section 155-158, Engle Act, require Congressional approval for any public land
     withdrawal, reservation, or restriction of over 5,000 acres for any DoD project or facility.
     In addition, proponents need to prepare an Environmental Baseline Survey (EBS) for
     land acquisitions IAW AFI 32-7066, Environmental Baseline Surveys in Real Estate
     Transactions.
     3.3.2.3. Funding. If funding for range real estate is received in one allotment, acquisition
     for all lands should proceed immediately. If funds are received incrementally over
     multiple budget cycles, acquisition should proceed according to a plan that will obtain an
     initial operational capability at the earliest date. For example, a range complex consisting
     of a Class A and two Class C tactical range areas can be acquired in three increments.
     Funds from the first increment should be used to acquire lands providing the highest
     benefit to the Air Force. Each increment should provide an operational capability of its
     own.
     3.3.2.4. Other Agency Cooperation. Agreements with other federal, state, local, and
     tribal government agencies should be finalized and signed during the acquisition phase.
     In some locations, USAF ranges require liaison and cooperation with many agencies in
     connection with livestock management, fish and wildlife conservation, forest
     management, immigration and border control, irrigation development, etc. It is important
     that any issues effecting operations or safety be settled before the range activation date.
     Base commanders having parent command jurisdiction of an Air Force range must
     investigate and ensure liaison and cooperation with appropriate agencies of federal, state,
     local, and tribal governments. Refer to AFI 32-7060, Interagency and Intergovernmental
     Coordination For Environmental Planning for specific requirements. Coordination IAW
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                               27


       Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, 14 July 1982, is
       required for any actions that might influence another agency's plans, programs, or
       projects.
           3.3.2.4.1. Additional information on coordination, outreach and interagency/
           intergovernmental agency cooperation can be found on the RMAST website/wiki.
           3.3.2.4.1. (AFSOC) Conduct regular public outreach meetings, not less than
           annually, to maintain relationship with communities affected by range operations.
           Active participation in the Wing’s Community Action Group or similar public
           outreach program is sufficient. These meetings should be open forum question and
           answer periods designed to foster a relationship of trust. The meetings should be
           attended by the wing commander or his designated representative (at a minimum
           squadron commander). The airspace/range/airfield representative, Public Affairs
           (PA) officer, Judge Advocate (JA) officer, Civil Engineer Environmental Element
           (CEAV), Community Planner (CEAO), and Safety (SE) shall participate as required.
           3.3.2.4.2. (Added-AFSOC) Work with the PA officer to: submit letters to local
           civic leaders and government officials informing them of current activities and future
           actions; issue an annual local press release describing activities that occur on the
           range; and work with local civic leaders to ensure the ROA or appropriate base
           representatives are invited to any city, county, or regional planning meetings that may
           impact airspace/range operations. Optimally, the ROA should seek permanent
           representation in these planning forums.
   3.3.3. Moving or establishing a live munitions area is a Major Action. To do so, the ROA
   will accomplish a T/TSNS and will comply with the EIAP with the assistance of the parent
   MAJCOM.
   3.3.4. Closing or Transferring of Ranges. When declared excess to the range requirements
   by the ROA, land will be surface cleared in accordance with AF standards. The ROA will
   notify the supporting Civil Engineering organization with real property responsibility of the
   excess status for subsequent action to determine a new use and accomplish required
   clearance for the new use. It is Air Force policy to clear safe for the proposed future land use
   and issue Certificates of Clearance for excess ranges or ranges converted to other uses but
   remaining on the installation property inventory. The supporting Civil Engineering
   organization will ensure clearance IAW 6055.9-STD, excess declaration IAW AFI 32-9004,
   Disposal of Real Property and NEPA actions IAW 32 CFR Part 989, Airspace transfer IAW
   AFI 13-201 and disposition of government owned range equipment and facilities IAW with
   MAJCOM guidance.
3.4. National, Regional, and Local Range and Airspace Meetings. Actions involving use,
creation, modification, or transfer of military airspace/ranges generate significant public interest.
The Air Force must be prepared to address concerns raised at the local, regional, or national level
during the development of any airspace/range action. AFI 13-201 describes the various forums
that allow units, MAJCOMs, and HQ USAF to focus on airspace/range issues and exchange
information and lessons learned in airspace/range development.
3.4. (AFSOC)National, Regional, and Local Range and Airspace Meetings. Airspace and
Range Conference. Headquarter Air Combat Command (HQ ACC)/A3A holds an annual
 28                                              AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


Airspace and Range Conference to ensure the widest dissemination of current Airspace and
Range information. Conference attendees include: RM, OSS/CC (or designee) wing weapons
and tactics or equivalent. HQ AFSOC/A3AR will attend and will request support from other
AFSOC staff directorates, as required. Examples of topics to address are: range safety,
operating procedures, targets and target sets, threats, range clean-up, weapons safety footprints,
scoring, cooperative natural resource management, wild land fire management, etc.
3.5. Planning Tools. Each range will maintain documents and graphical information used in
planning IAW AFMAN 33-363 to ensure that records remain available to range staff.
   3.5.1. Document Management System. Documents may be stored and indexed physically or
   electronically. If managed electronically, documents should be made available to all range
   users and supporters through secure means (request/reply or secure access).
   3.5.2. Geographic Information System (GIS). The most basic of systems would be hard
   copies of maps that describe the range’s attributes in each of the investment areas. Ideally,
   range geospatial data should be maintained in an accessible, relational database. The database
   of geospatial features should be readily accessed by the GeoBase web-based viewer
   application as well as the range management and scheduling tools.
3.6. (Added-AFSOC) Funding Requirements. Range funding requirements are captured in
both the POM cycle and the current year Execution Plan submissions. HQ AFSOC/A3A is the
command advocate for range issues and will coordinate all funding requirements with HQ
AFSOC/A8P and HQ AFSOC/FMA, as appropriate. For POM cycle issues, the ROA will
submit funding requirements to HQ AFSOC/A3 via HQ AFSOC/A3A. For execution year
unfunded requirements ROA will submit UFRs via the Base through the FM BER/EOY
processes. HQ AFSOC/A3AR will be listed as the MAJCOM POC on the BER input and will
validate the UFR for HQ AFSOC/FM. Reference all requirements to a specific range investment
area (see AFI 13-212, paragraph 3.2.4.1.1.). Submissions will clearly describe the requirement
and the impact if not funded. HQ AFSOC/A3A will seek HQ AFSOC/A3 validation,
prioritization and advocacy for these requirements during the AFSOC corporate process. For
new or additive manpower initiatives, HQ AFSOC/A3A will coordinate with HQ AFSOC/A1M
for validation prior to funding actions.
   3.6.1. (Added-AFSOC) Range Support Vehicles. Funding requests to acquire range
   support vehicles and equipment will be submitted to HQ AFSOC/A3AR for coordination
   with HQ AFSOC/A4R staff. Federal Acquisition Regulation 45 cites that contractors are
   provided Government Furnished Property (GFP) when it is clearly demonstrated that it is in
   the Government’s best interest. AFI 23-302, requires that units obtain MAJCOM Vehicle
   Management Staff approval prior to including any government-owned vehicles as GFP in a
   Performance Work Statement. Any vehicles that are to be provided by the government as
   GFP must be coordinated through the 27 SOLRS for approval/disapproval by HQ
   AFSOC/A4REV. Additionally any new vehicle requirements, not previously authorized,
   require Accounting and Finance/Contracting to complete a Cost Benefits Analysis prior to
   approval/disapproval by 27 SOLRS and HQ AFSOC/A4REV.
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                           29

                           RANGE OPERATIONS AND SAFETY

4.1. Range Operations. Range operations will be IAW this instruction, AFI 13-201, AFI 11-
214, T.O. 1-1M-34, Aircrew Weapons Delivery Manual, T.O. 1-1M-34-1, Aircrew Weapons
Delivery Manual (classified), aircraft specific weapons delivery T.O.s, aircraft specific AFI 11-
2MDS series, and Air Force Weapons School (AFWS) instructional texts.
4.1. (AFSOC)Range Operations. RCOs and ROOs must be familiar with Joint Publication
(JP) 3-09, Joint Fire Support, JP 3-09.1, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Laser
Designation Operations, and JP 3-09.3, Close Air Support (CAS), to ensure range procedures are
compatible and consistent with appropriate operational doctrine.
   4.1.1. Additional operating restrictions during range clearance and maintenance are
   contained in paragraph 7.6.
   4.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) Range Scheduling. Publish range scheduling procedures in the
   local range addendum and post them on the range web page. The SA will establish, as a
   minimum, scheduling procedures for: normal and additional operating hours, schedule
   changes, and dissemination of range safety information to off-station/non-local users. Only
   the SA will coordinate changes to the range schedule. The RCO or ROO may coordinate
   current-day schedule changes with range users but will immediately inform the SA of those
   changes.
       4.1.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) Off-station/non-local users (units without established Letters
       of Agreements with the MAFR). These users will provide a mission profile for each
       requested range period. The SA will validate and approve the mission profile, then
       inform the user of acceptance, denial, or recommended changes. The user must
       acknowledge receipt of the approved mission profile at least 24 hours prior to range
       usage. The acknowledgement will include: mission number (if applicable), flight call
       sign, scheduled range date/time, and ordnance (if applicable).
       4.1.2.2. (Added-AFSOC) Short Notice Cancellations. For range scheduling purposes, a
       short notice cancellation is defined as 48 hours prior to the scheduled mission or the
       minimum time needed for another user to prepare a mission. Publish short notice
       cancellation times in the local range addendum.
   4.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) Conducting Tests on PTRs. IAW AFI 99-109, Major Range and
   Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Test and Evaluation Resource Planning, testers will take full
   advantage of investments in DOD ranges and facilities. Test teams should plan to use DOD
   MRTFBs, other Air Force test capabilities or non-DOD government facilities before
   requesting the use of a PTR. If the Test Team believes a test can effectively be accomplished
   on MAFR, the Test Director must consider the following conditions in a request for
   exception to HQ AFSOC/A3A.
       4.1.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) There are no scheduling impacts to the training mission of the
       range.
       4.1.3.2. (Added-AFSOC) There are no costs incurred by the range or the range
       operations and maintenance (O&M) contractor, to include overtime.
 30                                              AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


       4.1.3.3. (Added-AFSOC) There are no permanent impacts to the range, i.e. the range
       will be returned to the same state as prior to the test.
       4.1.3.4. (Added-AFSOC) Test activities are IAW the approved National Environmental
       Policy Act process developed for the range.
       4.1.3.5. (Added-AFSOC) The tester is completely aware of MAFR capabilities (or lack
       of), is aware of potential issues such as limited instrumentation, and any associated
       impacts will not adversely affect the test.
       4.1.3.6. (Added-AFSOC) Proper Operational Risk Management (ORM) is
       accomplished prior to conducting any portion of the test on MAFR. The tester must
       provide test-specific ORM to the ROA for consideration, and the ROA must determine
       whether the test activity can be safely conducted on their range.
       4.1.3.7. (Added-AFSOC) Forward test activity requests, to include a test POC and the
       ORM determination, to HQ AFSOC/A3AR. HQ AFSOC/A3AR reviews and forwards to
       HQ AFSOC/A3A for approval of the requested test activity.
4.2. Written Agreements for USAF-Operated Ranges. The ROA will maintain a copy of all
agreements pertinent to their range and ensure they are readily available to the ROO and RCO.
4.2. (AFSOC)Written Agreements for USAF-Operated Ranges. This supplement contains
additional operational checks and balances to enhance range safety. However, each flight crew
and/or range user is responsible for thoroughly understanding the contents of the instruction, this
supplement, and any range-specific addendum or agreement. The ROA will ensure the
necessary procedures are in place to enforce this requirement.
   4.2.1. Domestic Users. The ROA or MAJCOM will conclude written agreements with any
   regular range user not identified in the range supplement. Written agreements are not
   required for limited use during exercises, deployments, evaluations, or inspections.
   4.2.1. (AFSOC) The ROA will serve as the Functional Area Agreements Coordinator IAW
   AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures, paragraph 2.4.1. Forward all written
   agreements which describe AFSOC’s MAFR responsibilities to HQ AFSOC/A3AR for
   coordination prior to implementation.
   4.2.2. Foreign Users. These agreements include the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU),
   Letter of Agreement (LOA), Host-Tenant Support Agreement (HTSA), Inter-service Support
   Agreement (ISA) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Letter of Offer and Acceptance. Each
   signatory ensures that these agreements meet the needs of the organization without
   compromising the mission and without obligating the organization beyond its intent or
   authority. Coordinate the draft agreement with the staff Judge Advocate General. If a conflict
   arises regarding one of these agreements, the ROA should resolve the issue at the appropriate
   level.
   4.2.3. Types of Written Agreements.
       4.2.3.1. Memorandum of Understanding. A MOU is required for Air Force units to use
       weapons ranges belonging to another nation. Individual units normally author these
       MOUs. MAJCOM/FM, JA, and the State Department Mission in the host country review
       these MOUs for legal and financial implications.
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                              31


      4.2.3.2. Letter of Agreement. Use LOAs to specify procedures at the local level, such as
      those between the operating agency and the controlling agency of the local airspace.
      4.2.3.2. (AFSOC) Address unit priorities and specific scheduling concerns in a letter of
      agreement between the range scheduling office and frequent range users.
      4.2.3.3. Host-Tenant Support Agreement and Inter-service Support Agreement. When
      required, prepare an HTSA or ISA IAW AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures.
      As a guide, an HTSA or ISA should be entered into when a unit from another service
      uses an Air Force owned or operated range more than 12 days per calendar year or
      supporting the recurring use by another service is a significant portion of range
      utilization.
4.3. Joint and Shared Use of Ranges.
   4.3.1. Joint Use. Joint Use will be established by HTSA, ISA, LOA, license, or other written
   agreement between the Host range and joint user IAW AFI 25-201. All written agreements
   should ensure the ROA can terminate user activities detrimental to the range’s natural,
   cultural, or physical infrastructure and obtain compensation or redress.
   4.3.2. Shared Use. Shared use of ranges with non-DoD users is encouraged when it will not
   compromise public safety, nor detract from mission accomplishment, nor impair range
   operations in any way. In all cases, public access to live ordnance areas and other areas
   where hazardous activities occur is prohibited until they are decontaminated IAW DoD
   6055.9-STD or other appropriate standards determined by the DoD Explosives Safety Board,
   or meet the criteria set forth in paragraph 4.12.4. All visitors granted access to the range must
   be briefed on range safety IAW paragraph 4.13.4.3. Shared Use may be characterized as
   either Concurrent Shared Use or Non-Concurrent Shared Use.
      4.3.2.1. Concurrent Shared Use. Civil activities may occur concurrently with range
      operations provided human access is prohibited in the Hazard Area. Agriculture, grazing
      and timber management are examples of activities that are conducive to concurrent
      shared use. The ROA will determine suitability and manage grazing programs IAW AFI
      32-7064.
          4.3.2.1.1. Grazing Programs can be a complementary activity on USAF ranges.
          Grazing programs on Department of the Interior lands withdrawn for USAF use are
          generally the responsibility of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). An INRMP
          must be prepared for all ranges addressing all issues associated with natural
          resources.
          4.3.2.1.2. Other Commercial Activities. Air Force ranges may also offer other
          commercial uses such as timber management, agricultural out-leasing, and mining.
          Again, many of these programs are generally the responsibility of the BLM. The
          Minerals Management Service of the Department of Interior manages the oil and gas
          exploitation on the outer continental shelf applicable to USAF over-water ranges.
      4.3.2.2. Non-Concurrent Shared Use. Civil use of range land and airspace may be
      allowed within the Hazard Area (exclusive of live ordnance areas) IAW paragraph
      4.12.4. Recreation and education programs are often compatible because many ranges
      encompass large airspace, land, or water areas and may contain significant natural
 32                                              AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


       resources, wild areas, historical sites, or archaeological sites. As custodian of this public
       property, the USAF has the responsibility to maintain it in the best manner possible
       consistent with the military mission. The INRMP will outline public access to natural
       resources. This plan is prepared in cooperation with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and
       the state fish and game agency. Additionally, the Cultural Resources Management Plan
       will manage and preserve sensitive areas while addressing public concerns.
4.4. Supersonic Flight. Supersonic flight restrictions within the U.S. National Airspace System
are contained in AFI 13-201. Overseas locations will comply with host nation rules.
4.4. (AFSOC)Supersonic Flight. Refer to AFI 13-201_ACC SUP, Air Force Airspace
Management and AF/3O-BR ―Supersonic Waiver Approval Letter‖. The ROA will report
utilization to HQ AFSOC/A3AR no later than 10 working days following the reporting period.
4.5. Flare, Chaff and Electronic Attack (EA) Employment. Unless further restricted by
MAJCOM or local supplements, flares will be employed IAW AFI 11-214, while Chaff and EA
will be employed IAW CJCSM 3212.02, Performing Electronic Attack in the United States and
Canada for Tests, Training and Exercises and AFI 11-2MDS series instructions. This guidance
assumes use of current inventory flares and chaff, and an adequate environmental assessment of
action. The use of flare or chaff cartridges having significantly different characteristics
(pyrophoric flares or double squibbed chaff) is restricted to authorized test and evaluation
activities until their use is authorized by the appropriate MAJCOM.
4.6. Jettison Areas. All ranges will have an area within the Hazard Area designated for jettison
of ordnance and stores. The location of jettison areas and jettison procedures will be designed to
minimize the hazard to ground personnel and range structures as well as aircraft and aircrew.
4.7. Armament Safety Procedures. Prior to first release when carrying expendable ordnance
(live, inert, or training), final switch configuration for weapon release will not be accomplished
until the aircraft is in such a position that any accidental release will be contained within the
range. MAJCOMs will develop specific guidance for armament system configurations for
multiple passes. After completing final weapons delivery, each flight member will perform a
weapons system safety check. Refer to AFI 11-214, aircraft specific AFI 11-2MDS series
operating procedures, and individual range supplements for additional guidance.
4.7. (AFSOC)Armament Safety Procedures. All users of MAFR will perform a
dry/familiarization pass before weapons delivery (day or night). The RCO may grant first pass
release with prior coordination for specific mission/exercise scenarios.
4.8. Weapons Release Authority. Acceptance of weapons release authority incurs sole
responsibility for the safe release of ordnance.
   4.8.1. Terminology Conventions. To prevent miscommunication, the term ―cleared‖ will
   only be used when authorizing weapons release. For all other matters, ―approved‖,
   ―authorized‖ or any term other than ―cleared‖ will be used. The term ―continue‖ will be used
   IAW JP 3-09.3, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Close Air Support (CAS) to
   acknowledge requests or indicate approval to proceed with an attack or action without
   providing clearance to release any ordnance yet.
   4.8.2. On Class A ranges, weapons release authority resides inherently with the RCO. For
   each pass, the RCO will authorize weapons release with a ―cleared hot‖ radio call unless
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                            33


   release authority has been delegated. The RCO may delegate weapons release authority to a
   qualified flight lead, individual pilot, Forward Air Controller-Airborne (FAC[A]), JTAC or
   other briefed person by issuing an ―Authorized (flight lead, individual pilot, FAC[A], JTAC,
   etc.) Control‖ radio call. The RCO, who will remain in either the main or flank tower (or
   another MAJCOM approved location), retains overall range authority at all times and can
   withdraw release clearance or abort a release at any time.
   4.8.3. On Class B and C ranges, weapons release authority devolves hierarchically to the
   JTAC, FAC(A), flight lead, individual pilot or other briefed person who may then delegate
   the authority as desired.
   4.8.4. (Added-AFSOC) On the day of the mission employing ordnance (practice or full-
   scale), but no later than the start of the tactical portion of the mission, each flight/mission
   lead shall confirm with the range control agency the specific target, planned ordnance on
   each target and applicable restrictions (manned sites, etc.). In-flight "retargeting" exercises
   require approval of the RCO before expending ordnance on the new target, and the
   flight/mission lead shall confirm approval. Exception: Local Users may be approved for
   profiles as defined in the Local Range Addendum.
4.9. Simulated Weapons Release Authority. Except during flight-lead or individual control,
to emulate the clearance procedures contained in JP 3-09.3, the weapons release authority should
issue a ―continue dry‖ radio call to signify authority to simulate weapons release.
4.10. Weapons Employment and Airdrop Operations.
   4.10.1. Do not employ weapons outside approved DoD SUA.
   4.10.2. The ROA will notify the public when a WDZ footprint will fall outside the lateral
   confines of the rangeland and will conduct a risk assessment to minimize the hazard to the
   public and non-DoD property.
   4.10.3. Except as noted below, ROAs will prohibit weapons employment unless an
   applicable WDZ Tool/SAFE-RANGE footprint, test footprint or surface danger zone has
   been applied to the target for the specific delivery platform, weapon and employment
   parameters. ROAs may expedite analysis by grouping targets together or combining aircraft
   type, weapon type, and tactics, as appropriate. Test footprints are not authorized for training
   missions, nor are applicable training footprints, by themselves, sufficient for test missions,
   but training footprints may be used as part of the ROA’s overall risk assessment.
   4.10.3. (AFSOC) To further ensure public safety, the ROA will perform an ORM
   assessment annually to establish specific weapons restrictions, procedures, armament switch
   settings, etc., for aircraft delivering ordnance on the range. Include this information in the
   range addendum to AFI 13-212_AFSOCSUP or other local guidance. Consider all
   applicable guidance in AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, AFI 11-2, Mission
   Design Series (MDS) Specific, Volume 3, and other DOD service-specific guidelines.
       4.10.3.1. Where containment is software selectable, ROAs will apply SAFE-RANGE
       footprints, weapons danger zones and surface danger zones (SDZs) that provide the
       following containment of projectiles, fragments, debris and components as a minimum:
           4.10.3.1.1. Surface fires: 99.9999% (Expressed as 1:1,000,000 escapement for SDZs)
           4.10.3.1.2. Aviation-delivered gun ammunition: 99.999%.
34                                            AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


         4.10.3.1.3. All other aviation-delivered ordnance: 99.99%.
     4.10.3.2. For test missions only, if the application of footprints would preclude the
     accomplishment of test objectives, the ROA, in conjunction with the test Safety Review
     Board (SRB) may authorize the use of a risk management policy. The ROA will perform,
     and the SRB must validate, a risk assessment to identify and minimize hazards consistent
     with test objectives. (See AFI 99-103, Capabilities Based Test and Evaluation)
     4.10.3.3. ROAs may continue to use legacy SAFE-RANGE footprints until the end of
     the sixth month following ACC/A3A’s official fielding of the applicable, successor,
     probabilistic WDZ Tool footprint.
     4.10.3.4. (Added-AFSOC) For Partner Nations (PN) using same type U.S. aircraft and
     U.S. weapons, the ROA may use a U.S. aircraft Weapons Danger Zone (WDZ) in their
     ORM assessment. Notify HQ AFSOC/A3AR of the use of this applicable WDZ prior to
     actual employment. The ROA may also apply a larger buffer, for risk mitigation
     purposes, if the PN is not a routine participant and unfamiliar with the range and
     exercise/training scenario. For unique ally aircraft and weapons, which are not in the
     U.S. inventory refer to AFI 13-212, paragraph 4.10.4.2.
  4.10.4. The WDZ Tool is the successor to the SAFE-RANGE Program. It creates
  probabilistic weapons impact footprints to help the ROA conduct safe range operations by
  defining aircraft-delivered WDZs per paragraph 4.12.4.1. The WDZ tool software identifies
  weapons impact point probabilities from a variety of platforms and parameters, providing an
  analytical foundation for sound and objective range planning and execution decision-making.
  Although similar to SAFE-RANGE, the WDZ tool is a joint-use range safety tool with a
  different hazard analysis methodology.
     4.10.4.1. WDZ tool methodology. The WDZ tool application methodology allows the
     ROA to identify possible target locations; modify allowable delivery ground tracks to
     eliminate or reduce hazards; identify the best location for range improvements; or design
     a new Impact Area/range. The methodology is based on WDZ footprints developed from
     a combination of actual weapon impact data and simulation results. A WDZ defines the
     minimum land required to employ a given munition safely, using a certain aircraft and
     delivery tactic, over a specific soil density and target type. Each WDZ footprint
     incorporates a probability distribution function (PDF), which provides the information
     necessary to perform a quantitative risk assessment and evaluate the relative risk of an
     identified hazard. See the RMAST wiki website for detailed application methodology for
     WDZ footprints for air-to-ground training operations.
     4.10.4.2. Training WDZ Footprints. HQ ACC/A3A is the lead USAF agent for procuring
     and modifying WDZ footprints except as noted below. Other MAJCOMs, services and
     foreign countries will fund their unique WDZ footprint requirements to include any costs
     for software licenses and equipment. MAJCOMs will coordinate with ACC/A3A at least
     6-9 months prior to the need date. Foreign countries will coordinate Direct Commercial
     Sales acquisition through ACC/A3A at least three months prior to the need date. For
     acquisition through the FMS Case, foreign countries will submit a Letter of Request
     through SAF/IA at least six months prior to the need date.
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                            35


         4.10.4.2.1. Specialized Footprints. Specialized WDZ footprints are available from
         HQ AFSOC/A3TW for the MH-53 (Sidefire program) and the AC-130H/U (Gunship
         Safety Footprint program).
  4.10.5. Test Footprints. MRTFB ROAs are responsible for ensuring test footprints are
  developed and applied for test missions (See AFI 99-103).
  4.10.6. Precautions with expendable munitions. Aircraft with free-falling and/or forward-
  firing ordnance will not over fly or point their guns at manned sites with intent to expend or
  employ weapons. Aircraft with moveable guns, such as helicopters and AC-130 Gunships,
  will not point their guns at any manned site. Facilities where the risk of damage is deemed
  unacceptable must not be within the WDZ and/or weapon fragmentation and ricochet pattern.
  4.10.7. Weapons Employment Near Manned Equipment, Facilities and Sites. In general,
  manned equipment, facilities and sites, such as range towers, simulated threat emitters, and
  observation posts (OP), may be located within the hazard area during range operations,
  provided training ordnance is used and an operational risk assessment was conducted and
  approved by the ROA IAW paragraph 4.14. At a minimum, this will include a WDZ
  footprint analysis to assess the risk. The ROA must approve each proposal in writing. The
  ROA may delegate approval authority for short notice, temporary locations known to be in a
  low risk area. However, each location authorized by the delegated approver will be for one-
  time use only. Additional requests must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis and approved by
  the ROA.
  4.10.8. ROAs will approve Improved-Container Delivery System (I-CDS) deliveries only if
  the Precision Airdrop System-Mission Planner (PADS-MP) derived 3-sigma(99.987)
  footprints for success and chute failure overlay only government owned, leased or otherwise
  controlled land with no non-mission essential personnel present and a Collateral Damage
  Estimate (CDE) acceptable to the ROA has been accomplished. ROAs will approve JPADS
  guided deliveries only if the PADS-MP derived point of impact, the 3-sigma(99.987)
  footprint for chute failure and the guidance failure footprint overlay only government owned,
  leased or otherwise controlled land with no non-mission essential personnel present and a
  Collateral Damage Estimate (CDE) acceptable to the ROA has been accomplished. If the
  load will or may transit non-Restricted Airspace during its fall (e.g. footprints are not wholly
  contained within restricted airspace), ROAs will also ensure the user complies with
  applicable rules contained in Federal Aviation Regulation 105.25.
     4.10.8.1. Equipment, facilities and mission essential personnel are permitted within the
     3-sigma(99.987) success, chute failure and the guidance failure footprints if the ROA has
     conducted and approved an operational risk assessment IAW paragraph 4.14. Because
     users utilize weather observation and drop sonde wind updates to revise their footprint
     analyses up until the time of delivery, ROAs should ensure the user is aware of the ROAs
     exclusion requirements and provided with the location of airspace/range boundaries and
     any personnel or equipment the ROA cannot or chooses not to allow in the footprint as
     part of his risk analysis.
  4.10.9. (Added-AFSOC) Ground Weapons. The ROA will perform a risk assessment and
  establish appropriate procedures prior to firing ground weapons. Ground weapons (small
  arms, artillery, surface-to-surface missiles, etc.) present surface danger hazards not accounted
  for in the WDZ tool; therefore, the requestor must provide the ROA detailed information to
 36                                             AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


   support a risk assessment. The requestor can use a suitable planning tool such as the Army’s
   Range Manager Tool Kit (RMTK), available on the Army Sustainable Range Program
   website, https://srp.army.mil/, to provide the required information to the ROA. The RMTK
   calculates the Surface Danger Zone (see paragraph 4.12.4.2.) for ground weapons. The ROA
   must validate the information provided, and may use the same planning tool.
4.11. Laser and Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) Operations.
   4.11.1. Laser Device Range Operations. The ROA will not authorize laser device operations
   unless the range is certified IAW AFOSH Standard 48-139, Laser Radiation Protection
   Program; American National Standard Institute Z136.1, Safe Use of Lasers; MIL HDBK
   828A, Laser Safety on Ranges and in Other Outdoor Areas; and American National Standard
   Institute Z136.6, Safe Use of Lasers Outdoors. Laser devices include designators,
   rangefinders, and illuminators/pointers.
   4.11.2. DEW Range Operations. Except as noted below, the ROA will not authorize DEW
   operations (to include, but not limited to, high-energy lasers, weaponized microwave and
   millimeter wave beams, explosive-driven electromagnetic pulse devices, acoustic weapons,
   laser induced plasma channel systems, non-lethal directed energy devices, and atomic-scale
   and subatomic particle beam weapons) unless the range is certified IAW applicable
   instructions, including DoD Instruction 6055.11, Protection of DoD Personnel from
   Exposure to Radiofrequency Radiation and Military Exempt Lasers; ANSI/IEEE C95.1
   Standard for Safety Levels with Respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency
   Electromagnetic Fields, 3 kHz to 300 GHz; AFOSH Std 48-9, Radio Frequency Radiation
   (RFR) Safety Program; and AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards.
      4.11.2.1. Research and Test and Evaluation (T&E) activities involving laser
      devices/DEW (RF devices) do not require range certification if conducted IAW AFI 99-
      103, Test Management, AFMCI 99-103, Test Management, and (if applicable) AFRLI
      61-103, AFRL Research Test Management. Include the Base Laser Safety Officer on the
      Safety Review Board hazard assessment team. The SRB must show the control of the
      hazards from the beginning of operations commencing until termination. Hazards
      extending beyond restricted airspace or controlled government land must show the
      appropriate levels of federal and local coordination are in place. The Installation
      Commander is the final approval authority in lieu of formal range certification.
      Additional expertise regarding Test and Evaluations can be obtained by contacting the
      711th Human Performance Wing (711HPW) or the Air Force Research Laboratory
      (AFRL).
   4.11.3. Range Certification. The ROA will request laser device range certification and/or
   DEW (i.e. RF device) range certification through the MAJCOM to the 711HPW/RHD.
   711HPW/RHD will report certification results to the ROA, base bioenvironmental engineer,
   and MAJCOM. DEW evaluations will be a collaborative effort between 711HPW/RHD,
   AFRL/RD, and any other agency needed to ensure foreseeable health and material safety
   concerns are considered. Laser range evaluations will be conducted by 711HPW/RHDO in
   collaboration with other agencies as needed to enable safe mission accomplishment.
   Evaluations will include an on-site survey, a review of proposed activities (weapons, targets,
   and tactics) and provide range-specific laser device or DEW safety footprints, safety
   recommendations, and systems approved for use on that range.
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                             37


   4.11.4. Annual Reviews. The LSO and/or DEWSO will review applicable operations with
   the ROO/ROA annually and report findings as directed by AFRL.
   4.11.5. Certification Validity. Certifications expire at the end of the third fiscal year
   following issuance (e.g. a certification dated 3 Dec 2006 expires on 31 Sep 2010). Upon
   expiration, the certification must be reaccomplished IAW paragraph 4.11.3. Prior to
   expiration, the certification is valid for the equipment, aircraft, targets, tactics and weapons
   evaluated as long as the report’s recommendations are complied with, land and airspace
   boundaries remain unchanged, annual reviews are submitted within 45 days of the initial
   report’s anniversary and periodic removal of specular hazards for lasers meets the
   requirements in paragraph 4.11.6. The reinstatement or extension of a certification will be at
   the discretion of AFRL based on the scope of changes.
   4.11.6. Laser Device and Laser DEW Range Operations. The director of Base Medical
   Services will be notified of the specific type of laser activity that will occur on the range.
   Range personnel will have a baseline eye exam before working in the laser hazard
   environment. During laser operations, all range personnel in the Laser Surface Danger Zone
   (LSDZ) will wear laser eye protection of appropriate optical density. Periodically remove
   specular hazards from the LSDZ surrounding the targets; reference guidance in MIL HDBK
   828A as necessary. Lasers will not be operated without the approval of the LSO and the
   ROO (RCO on Class A Ranges). The user will notify the ROO or RCO upon termination of
   laser activity. The ROO or RCO will acknowledge termination and the ROA will record the
   start and stop time of range periods when laser operations take place.
   4.11.6. (AFSOC) The ROA must specify the lasers and settings authorized for use on the
   range (IAW the Laser Survey), e.g., "COMBAT MODE" versus "TRAINING MODE"
   settings, etc.
   4.11.7. Non-Laser DEW Range Operations. Non-Laser DEW systems will not be operated
   without the approval of the DEWSO and the ROO (RCO on Class A Ranges). The user will
   notify the ROO or RCO upon termination of DEW activity which will be acknowledged. The
   ROA will record the start and stop time of range periods when DEW operations take place.
   4.11.8. Ground Lasers. Ground lasers will not be directed at targets or Hazard Areas where
   the laser beam will terminate with an ocular hazard beyond the range boundary unless the
   laser will exclusively transit SUA below FL600 and terminate in space without affecting
   non-participating satellites.
   4.11.9. Injury Reporting. Report laser injuries IAW AFOSH Standard 48-139 and
   radiofrequency radiation injuries IAW AFOSH Standard 48-9, Radio Frequency Radiation
   (RFR) Safety Program.
   4.11.10. Laser Weapon, Device and DEW Certification on foreign and other U.S. service
   ranges. When USAF aircraft operate on another nation’s/service’s range, MAJCOMs will
   ensure procedures have been developed and are promulgated by the host nation/service prior
   to employing lasers weapons, devices and/or DEW systems. In the event procedures have not
   been developed, laser weapon, device and DEW operations will comply with this instruction.
4.12. Range     Access. MAJCOMs          and   ROAs        will    develop      procedures   for
permitting/deconflicting ground party and non-military activities on the range. (Note: Where the
 38                                             AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


terms Essential Personnel, Mission Essential Personnel and Nonessential Personnel are used
below, reference Attachment 1 of this instruction.)
   4.12.1. In addition to the signs required by AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security
   Program (FOUO), ROAs will post approved signs (multi-lingual where required and as
   depicted on the RMAST Wiki site or MAJCOM-approved substitutes) on the boundary:
      4.12.1.1. Where crossed by roads, paths, trails, streams, streambeds or railways.
      4.12.1.2. At 200m intervals where roads, paths, trails or railways parallel the range
      boundary within 500m.
      4.12.1.3. At 1000m intervals in other readily accessible areas not included above.
      4.12.1.4. (Added-AFSOC) Post warning signs at the entrance(s) to areas with specific
      hazards (Unexploded Ordnance, Lasers, RF, etc.) and include the hazard on the sign.
   4.12.2. Signs are not required in areas that are not readily accessible on foot or with wheeled
   vehicles (e.g. mountainous terrain, swamps, lakes, etc.).
   4.12.3. Impact Areas. The Impact Area is that area on a range immediately surrounding the
   target(s) or designated mean point(s) of impact approved for actual ordnance delivery. Public
   access to Impact Areas is prohibited at all times. Access to Impact Areas when the range is
   inactive will be limited to Essential Personnel. The Impact Area demarcation will be
   determined locally using ORM analysis IAW paragraph 4.14, but should normally be no less
   than either a) 500 feet from the center of a target or designated mean point of impact (DMPI)
   approved for live ordnance, or b) 300 feet from the center of a target or DMPI used solely for
   inert or practice ordnance.
   4.12.4. Hazard Areas. The Hazard Area is a composite of all WDZs and surface danger
   zones (SDZs) for all authorized weapon delivery events against targets or DMPIs approved
   for actual ordnance expenditures. Public access to Hazard Areas is prohibited unless
   specifically authorized by the ROA. All live munitions must be accounted for in a Hazard
   Area or the applicable portion of a Hazard Area before public access is authorized. Access to
   active Hazard Areas is limited to Mission Essential Personnel. Access to inactive Hazard
   Areas is limited to Essential Personnel. Hazard Areas may be segmented based upon the
   targets, weapons, and tactics being utilized at a given time. If Hazard Areas are segmented,
   ROAs will ensure segment borders are readily identifiable by ground personnel. Access to
   Hazard Areas will be determined locally based on an ORM analysis per paragraph 4.14. On
   ranges where another agency controls Hazard Area access, the ROA will establish
   procedures to verify access control and inform that agency of potential hazards.
      4.12.4.1. Weapons Danger Zone (WDZ). The WDZ encompasses the ground and
      airspace for lateral and vertical containment of a user-determined percentage of
      projectiles, fragments, debris, and components resulting from the firing, launching,
      and/or detonation of aviation delivered ordnance. This three-dimensional zone accounts
      for weapon accuracy, failures, ricochets, and broaches (resurfacing) of a specific
      weapon/munition type delivered by a specific aircraft type.
      4.12.4.2. Surface Danger Zones (SDZ). The ground and airspace designated for vertical
      and lateral containment of a user-determined percentage of projectiles, fragments, debris,
      and components resulting from the firing, launching, or detonation of weapon systems to
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                             39


      include explosives and demolitions. See the U.S. Army’s Range Manager’s Toolkit
      Software for specific SDZ information.
   4.12.5. Danger Areas. The Danger Area is the composite area of the Hazard Area and all
   active LSDZs and active Directed Energy Weapons Danger Zones (DEWDZs). When the
   range is in use, access to those portions of the Danger Area comprised only of active LSDZs
   or active DEWDZs is limited to Mission Essential Personnel. When the range is not in use,
   access does not need to be restricted.
   4.12.6. Observation Posts (OPs). Notwithstanding paragraphs 4.10.7 and 4.12.3 to 4.12.5,
   OPs within a hazard area may be used by Tactical Air Control Parties (TACP) or other
   briefed personnel involved in CAS/air-to-ground training. If training requires personnel to be
   inside Hazard Area or Impact Area, they must remain outside the Minimum Safe Distances
   for Ground Parties (Live Fire Training) Table (MSD-T) contained in AFI 11-214,
   Attachment 6. ROAs will conduct a risk assessment of the proposed OP or maneuver area
   prior to the ROA approving the OP’s use. All personnel will wear protective gear IAW AFI
   13-112V1, Terminal Attack Controller Training Program while inside the hazard area. For
   weapons not listed in the AFI 11-214 chart, TACPs or other briefed personnel must adhere to
   restrictions contained in paragraphs 4.12.3 to 4.12.5.
4.13. Range Safety.
   4.13.1. Visual Identification of Manned Equipment, Facilities and Site. To the maximum
   extent possible, equipment and facilities, manned or unmanned, that are not targets should
   include visual identification systems, such as high contrast paint (white or orange), IR
   strobes, etc. White or orange paint will not be used on any ―bombable‖ targets with the
   exception of strafe ―rags‖ or specific test targets where white supports test objectives.
   4.13.2. Range Demonstrations and Visitor Procedures. Each ROA must publish or reference
   procedures in their local range supplement to ensure positive control of all spectators. Visitor
   locations must be analyzed using the appropriate weapons footprint/hazard area program to
   ensure that spectators are not within the hazard area during operations. The ROA will have
   control in those limited cases where DoD personnel or contractors must be within the hazard
   area during operations to accomplish a specific mission-related task.
   4.13.2. (AFSOC) Each range will maintain a visitor's log documenting each visitor’s name,
   grade, organization, date, and purpose of visit. Maintain the log at the range for a minimum
   of 1 year.
   4.13.3. Flight Safety.
      4.13.3.1. Airspace Activation. The RCO will activate range airspace with the local ATC
      facility or Air Traffic representative IAW local agreements between the ROA and the
      controlling agency. The request for activation should be timed (before a scheduled
      mission) to allow shared or joint users to clear the area and for the controlling agency to
      make internal adjustments.
      4.13.3.2. Weather Observation. The RCO will monitor weather conditions to include
      altimeter setting, temperature, ceiling, visibility and winds. Observations may be obtained
      from the local base weather station, command post, Automated Weather Observing
      System (AWOS), or ATC agency at least hourly, if the capability is not available at the
40                                            AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


     range. The local weather detachment or command post should advise the RCO of any
     sudden adverse weather changes that might effect range operations or safety.
     4.13.3.2. (AFSOC) Each Class A range will maintain a reliable anemometer to measure
     the local wind speed and direction. Speed and direction readout will be available in the
     range tower.
     4.13.3.3. Aircraft Accident Procedures. In case of an aircraft crash during Class A range
     operations, the RCO will initiate all necessary emergency actions. These include
     appropriate notifications, closing of the range, and assuming responsibility as the interim
     on-scene commander until the crash response team can be organized. During Class B and
     C range operations, the flight lead, individual pilot, FAC(A), JTAC or other briefed
     person will start the emergency actions, and if feasible, act as the interim on scene-
     commander. Investigations will be conducted IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and
     Reports.
     4.13.3.3. (AFSOC) The ROA will include AFSOC/A3AR as an addressee on all reports
     (written, verbal, or electronic) to HQ AFSOC following major accidents or incidents such
     as crashes, off-range munitions impacts, inadvertent releases/dropped objects, fires, and
     personnel injuries. The ROA may provide initial notification to the AFSOC Operations
     Center telephonically, as soon as practical, of incidents that will require HQ AFSOC/A3
     involvement or assistance, and will follow up via electronic mail. Notify HQ
     AFSOC/A3A by electronic standard mail when a formal investigation is convened
     concerning range incidents. Send information copies of correspondence concerning
     range incidents to HQ AFSOC/A3AR.
     4.13.3.4. (Added-AFSOC) Personnel must not conduct activities which divert attention
     from situational tasks such as controlling or monitoring the movement of aircraft or
     ground parties using the range. Ensure personnel are available to perform these tasks
     during all required duty times. Personnel performing such duties must not compose or
     send emails or text messages unless required for the operation at hand, and should
     minimize activities which prevent timely communications or situational evaluation, e.g.
     unofficial telephone calls, etc.
  4.13.4. Ground and Explosive Safety.
     4.13.4.1. Fire Suppression Equipment. On Class A and manned Class B ranges,
     appropriate fire suppression equipment and personnel must be available to deal with local
     fire hazards. This capability may be provided through USAF, landowner, in-service
     civilian, independent contractor assets, or through agreement with another government
     agency such as the BLM or US Forest Service. Sufficient hand-operated fire suppression
     equipment must be assigned directly to the range for emergency use.
     4.13.4.2. Emergency Procedures. Emergency procedures will be readily available to the
     RCO for use during range operations.
     4.13.4.2. (AFSOC) Develop RCO checklists for opening/closing procedures and
     emergency actions. Maintain a copy of AFI 13-212, higher headquarters supplements and
     the local addendum, along with any RCO checklists in the main RCO tower of a Class A
     Range. Review checklists annually to ensure they remain current.
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                              41


       4.13.4.3. Safety Briefing Requirements. The ROA or contractor will provide and
       document initial and yearly ground and explosive safety briefings IAW AFI 91-202, to
       personnel assigned to operate and maintain Air Force ranges. Non-EOD personnel and
       augmenting EOD Personnel will receive appropriate training from the lead EOD unit
       (normally the associate EOD unit) before assisting in range clearance. Authorized visitors
       and personnel who infrequently visit the range must be briefed on range safety.
       4.13.4.3. (AFSOC) Personnel will not enter any Hazard Area until they have received
       the range safety briefing. Tailor the safety briefing, as-needed, to include the items listed
       in AFI 13-212, paragraph A2.1. Use Attachment 10 Sample EOD Briefing Statement or
       similar method to document the safety briefing
       4.13.4.4. Hazard Condition Watch. The RCO and all range personnel must continually
       watch for hazardous conditions such as trespassers, fires, bird activity conditions, etc.
       Range users will be notified immediately of any hazardous conditions on the range. If
       safety is in question, the RCO or other appropriate authority will stop range operations
       until the situation is remedied.
       4.13.4.5. (Added-AFSOC) Fire Prevention. Identify range activities likely to cause
       range fires, and develop and implement procedures to mitigate them. Identify a single
       agency or office responsible for determining the fire danger hazard level, typically in
       cooperation with the land management agency. Develop a decision matrix and checklist
       to standardize fire prevention actions and ensure appropriate responses as fire conditions
       change. Include fire prevention in the Wildland Fire Management Plan and CRP.
4.14. Operational Risk Management (ORM) Program. ROAs will implement an ORM
program for the range IAW AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk Management (ORM) Guidelines
and Tools. As a minimum, the ORM development team will consist of operations, civil
engineering, legal, public affairs, safety, and EOD. The ORM analysis examines geographic
features, frequency of EOD sweeps, type of ordnance authorized, employment tactics, type of
proposed joint or shared use, etc.
4.15. Night Operations.
4.15. (AFSOC)Night Operations. The ROA shall determine the need for a night RCO. RCO
qualification and certification requirements are listed in Attachment 6, RCO Qualifications
and Certification. The ROA will establish procedures to support aircraft utilizing Night Vision
Devices (NVD)/Infrared Targeting Devices (ITD) compatible lighting or lights-out operations, to
include mixed NVD/lights-out and NVD/lights-on missions.
   4.15.1. Aircraft reduced, covert and blacked-out lighting operations will not be conducted on
   Class A ranges unless the RCO is equipped with binocular, generation-III NVDs. NVDs will
   be tested, adjusted and focused by the RCO before use with (in order of preference) the
   Hoffman ANV-20/20 Tester, a unit eye lane or equivalent tester. Perform NVD testing,
   adjustment and focusing procedures IAW appropriate T.O.s and MAJCOM guidance.
   4.15.1. (AFSOC) The ROA will ensure RCOs are equipped with, and have current training
   in, the use of NVDs for night range operations (as required).
   4.15.2. Range Lighting.
 42                                             AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


   4.15.2. (AFSOC) Include lighting upgrade plans in the Comprehensive Range Plan.
   Coordinate closely with local users to determine the best settings for range lighting. For the
   purposes of this publication, use the lighting definitions in Table 4.1., Lighting/Marking
   Scheme Definitions.

Table 4.1. (Added-AFSOC) Lighting/Marking Scheme Definitions.
 Type                             Definition
 NVD/ITD Invisible Lighting       Light/marking schemes that cannot be seen by individuals
                                  using NVDs/ITDs, but are clearly visible at night without
                                  NVDs/ITDs. (Example: NVDs--Low-powered blue light
                                  emitting diodes.)
 NVD/ITD Visible Lighting         Light/marking schemes clearly visible to individuals with
                                  or without NVD/ITDs, but does not cause NVD/ITD
                                  vision impairment. (Example: High-powered blue strobe
                                  lights for NVDs.)
 NVD/ITD-Only Lighting            Light/marking schemes clearly visible only to individuals
                                  using NVDs/ITDs, but does not cause NVD/ITDs vision
                                  impairment. (Example: Infrared pointers.)
      4.15.2.1. Class A Range Identification Lighting. Class A ranges that support night
      operations must have available a distinctive pattern of lights visible by aircrews, with and
      without NVDs, to ensure positive orientation and identification of the range and target
      area. These lights should be readily identifiable but not so as to distract aircrews during
      weapons delivery or wash out target locations. ROAs will ensure that no similar pattern
      of lights exists near the range that could be misidentified as targets or the Impact Area,
      but cultural lighting inside or outside the range boundary may serve as a portion of the
      distinctive pattern of lights.
      4.15.2.1. (AFSOC) Mark the range boundaries (the four corners as a minimum) and any
      other significant boundary-defining points with NVD visible lighting. This guidance is
      not meant to impede night operations at ranges where ranges are not yet compliant with
      the above guidance.
      4.15.2.2. Class B Range Identification Lighting. Class B ranges that support night
      operations will have lighting as described above unless the ROA has determined that the
      lighting is not required based on a documented, ORM analysis (based on range size,
      remoteness, etc.)
      4.15.2.3. Target Lighting. Lighting for the specific purpose of illuminating the target is
      only required on ranges that support users accomplishing unaided visual deliveries. If
      required (or desired by other users), target lighting may be accomplished using
      incandescent lights, lanterns, or flares. Lights and lanterns should be NVD compatible or
      reduced in intensity to produce the minimum halo around each light when viewed
      through NVDs. Every effort should be made to prevent the target from appearing as a
      light with a halo to allow positive target identification.
      4.15.2.3. (AFSOC) Each scheduled user will specify to the RCO what type of
      lighting/marking scheme is required for their mission. The RCO will ensure
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                              43


       lighting/marking scheme is set as requested and inform aircraft of issues that prohibit
       planned use of specific targets at night.
       4.15.2.4. Range Facility Identification.
           4.15.2.4.1. Range Tower and Routinely-Manned Facility Lighting. Lighting is
           required on all routinely-manned range facilities and range towers to facilitate
           positive identification by aircrew. Proper management of tower lighting is important
           to maximize performance of NVDs used by range personnel. Tower lighting (interior
           and exterior) should be minimized to those necessary to conduct operations and all
           unnecessary lights should be extinguished or taped over. NVD compatible lighting is
           highly recommended. Consider moving tower, routinely-manned facility and
           obstruction strobe lights to locations that will best support night operations.
           4.15.2.4.2. Other Manned Locations. Other manned locations (such as OPs, visitor
           locations, vehicles, etc.) will, as a minimum, mark their location by any means
           described in JP 3-09.3 for ―friendly marking‖ that facilitates positive identification by
           aircrew.
   4.15.3. IR Pointers and/or Lasers. A single, steady IR pointer will not be used as the sole
   means of target identification. If using an IR pointer to mark targets, either the target or
   friendly terminus of the pointer must be positively verified by another means (snaking,
   friendly location marking, etc.). Do not lase unprotected personnel within the laser’s
   Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance (NOHD). When ground based lasers/designators are used
   to designate targets, attack headings within 10° of the laser designator to target line (safety
   zone) are prohibited and run-in headings are restricted to a 50° cone on either side of the
   safety zone.
4.16. Communications Requirements. The ROA will submit all normal communications
capability requirements to the Base-Level Systems Telecommunications Engineering Manager
(STEM-B) for system planning. Consult AFI 33-101, Communications and Information
Management Guidance and Responsibilities for planning guidance. Test-specific systems on
MRTFBs may be obtained by local acquisition methods.
4.16. (AFSOC)Communications Requirements. Careful planning should precede all range
Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) requirements.
Coordinate with the local communications support unit to receive the technical solution for range
C4I requirements. Use at least a 50% expansion rate when planning/justifying C4I infrastructure.
Consider using the AFSOC Enterprise above all alternatives. All new communications
requirements must be submitted to HQ AFSOC/A6XP via the web-based Project Workflow
Requirements and Resources (PWRR) management system. Submit purchases of C4I equipment
not listed in the EXPlan as an unfunded requirement (except Automated Data Processing
Equipment) to HQ AFSOC/A3AR for staff coordination and prioritization.
   4.16.1. Class A, B and C ranges will have reliable point-to-point communications with the
   parent or using base and manned sites on the range. On Class A ranges, the range control
   tower will have redundant communications capability with the flank tower(s) and operations
   building(s). All parties or individuals must maintain two-way voice contact with the main
   tower, range office, and/or parent base while in the Hazard Area. Portable or mobile radios
 44                                             AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


   may be used for backup communications and to maintain contact with personnel in the
   Hazard Area.
   4.16.2. Class A, B and C ranges will have ground-to-air radios to communicate with aircraft
   on the range. Primary systems will normally be ultra high frequency (UHF) radios, but very
   high frequency (VHF), or frequency modulation (FM) radios are authorized at ranges where
   all users are similarly equipped. On Class A ranges, the RCO will have a backup,
   independent radio. Provision of dual, multi-band radios should be considered to maximize
   mission flexibility and safety monitoring capability. Class B ranges, if staffed, must have the
   capability to communicate with the aircraft to provide scores.
      4.16.2.1. All UHF, VHF, FM and Land Mobile Radios (LMR) voice frequencies being
      used on range will be recorded at all times.
      4.16.2.2. The RCO will ensure that all recorders are working properly. Each recording
      will contain the range name, date, and time. Recordings containing records of any range
      incident will be kept and secured until released by the investigating agency.
      4.16.2.2. (AFSOC) Recordings will contain the RCO's name, current weather, will be
      numbered in sequence, and major changes such as weather and RCOs will be noted as
      they occur. Recordings will be held a minimum of 48 hours prior to being overwritten.
      4.16.2.3. All aircraft utilizing the range will monitor Guard frequency.
      4.16.2.3. (AFSOC) MAFR must maintain the capability to broadcast emergency
      information on each radio frequency normally in use during range operations and on
      UHF Guard (243.0) and VHF Guard (121.5).
      4.16.2.4. Aircraft using UHF, VHF, or FM radios on the range will utilize range assigned
      UHF, VHF, or FM frequencies for primary operations.
   4.16.3. Communication Operations. Range personnel will normally operate all
   communications equipment used on range. Assign communications personnel as radio
   operators only when special conditions warrant.
   4.16.4. Intra-flight communications. All intra-flight communications should be
   accomplished on the assigned range frequency using standard terminology to allow safety
   monitoring by the RCO.
4.17. Range Operations Support.
   4.17.1. Supply. The ROA should establish procedures with the parent or servicing base
   supply organization to obtain materials for range operations, as well as salvage and disposal.
   When required, establish a separate supply section at the range to administer all supply
   activities.
   4.17.2. Vehicles. Use of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) vehicles in contract
   operations should be kept to a minimum per AFI 24-301, and Federal Acquisition Regulation
   (FAR) Part 45 § 304, Providing Motor Vehicles.
   4.17.2. (AFSOC) Establish procedures to provide vehicle support to range clearance
   operations.  Identify problems obtaining vehicles to HQ AFSOC/A4RE and HQ
   AFSOC/A3AR that cannot be resolved at the local level. Submit requests for assistance to
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                                45


   HQ AFSOC at least 60 days prior to the required date. Reference paragraph 3.6.1. for new
   vehicle requirements.
   4.17.3. Utilities. The ROA will ensure ranges are provided the utilities (gas, water, electric
   and sewer) required to enable range operations. Commercially provided services should be
   used when available, suitable and cost-effective.
   4.17.4. (Added-AFSOC) Other. The 27 SOSS/CC, the ROO and the O&M Site Manager
   shall meet regularly (no less than quarterly) to discuss range operations and requirements.
   The ROO Quality Assurance (QA) and range O&M contractor team shall attend selected
   squadron tactics/aircrew meetings for the same purpose. Also, the ROA should encourage
   regular range visits by wing leadership.
4.18. (Added-AFSOC) Target Management Program. Establish a comprehensive target
management program for the entire target life-cycle, from acquisition through disposal. The
program will document, as a minimum, the original equipment/vehicle (nomenclature,
make/model, etc.) or target construction material, preparation actions, location on the range,
required certifications, and disposal actions. Maintain target management records as part of the
range archives.
   4.18.1. (Added-AFSOC) Requirements. Target requirements should be documented
   through the Range Users Conference or other cooperative means involving both the users and
   ranges. This is a cost-effective means to determine the need for new targets or when to
   eliminate existing targets.
   4.18.2. (Added-AFSOC) Acquisition. Select the type of target, target material or
   construction method based on target suitability and projected life cycle cost. Factors to
   consider may include, but are not limited to: target fidelity, durability/ordnance to be used,
   and accessibility on the range, repair/maintenance, recycling opportunity, environmental
   impact and disposal costs. Note: The final target determination should be based on which
   target satisfies the training or test requirement and is the most cost effective. The 27
   SOSS/OSR should work closely with unit Intelligence and Weapons and Tactics offices and
   the 27 SOW/XP to develop realistic target sets to meet unit training requirements.
   4.18.3. (Added-AFSOC) Preparation. Proper target preparation will greatly reduce safety
   hazards and cleanup costs. Identify and remove all hazardous materials IAW paragraph
   2.5.35. and the following procedures.
       4.18.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) Perform, in coordination with the Installation Radiation
       Safety Officer (IRSO), a radiological screen to identify and remove radioactive
       components from military hardware; do not use technical publications as the sole means
       of identifying radiological hazards. Ranges will procure a commercial radiation detector
       (upon consultation with the IRSO) to screen military vehicles, equipment or aircraft
       intended to be used as targets. Radiological detection equipment will be operated by
       appropriately trained personnel.
       4.18.3.2. (Added-AFSOC) Drain all fluids except for a small amount of transmission
       fluid to permit the target to be dragged, as needed.
       4.18.3.3. (Added-AFSOC) Remove dense metal portions (engines, transmissions, etc.)
       from potential strafe targets unless essential to the operation or effectiveness of the target.
 46                                            AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


      4.18.3.4. (Added-AFSOC) De-specularize potential laser targets by removing reflective
      components; limit painting or masking to components which cannot be removed.
      4.18.3.5. (Added-AFSOC) Demilitarize military hardware (tank, artillery, aircraft, etc.)
      to the greatest extent practical before use as a target.
   4.18.4. (Added-AFSOC) Disposal. Targets which have been fired upon are considered
   material potentially presenting an explosive hazard (MPPEH) and will be disposed of IAW
   Chapter 7. Ensure all required inspections and certifications are properly documented prior
   to release from DOD control.
4.19. (Added-AFSOC) Smokey SAM/Smokey Gun Operations. When conducting launch
operations of the GTR-18A Rocket (Smokey SAM) or PJU-7A/E Projectile Simulator (Smokey
Gun) on the MAFR, follow the guidance in T.O. 11L1-2-23-1, Operational, Organizational and
Intermediate Maintenance Instruction--Smokey SAM Simulator/Antiaircraft Artillery Visual
Cueing System, and this supplement. Develop an operating instruction (OI) IAW AFMAN 91-
201, Explosives Safety Standards, to include procedures not covered in technical orders,
operators manuals, or this instruction.
   4.19.1. (Added-AFSOC) Responsibilities. The ROA and Launch Site Supervisor (LSS)
   will ensure compliance with this instruction. The LSS will directly monitor launch
   operations while the RCO will monitor overall range operations.
   4.19.2. (Added-AFSOC) Single person launches. T.O. 11L1-2-23-1 recommends two
   people for safe launch operations; however, launch operations may be performed by a single

                   ELECTRONIC COMBAT TRAINING OPERATIONS

5.1. Electronic Combat Training Operations. Electronic Combat (EC) Training Operations
facilities provide a realistic electronic threat environment for aircrew training through the use of
Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) and Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA) threat emitter simulators.
These facilities also provide Electronic Combat support for composite force training, unit
exercises, unit gunnery competitions, normal training missions, and higher HQ exercises or
inspections. To fulfill these requirements, EC threat equipment and operating procedures must
closely parallel those of the anticipated enemy threat systems.
   5.1.1. Electronic Scoring Sites (ESS). ESSs are normally located near instrumented MTRs,
   MOAs, and/or Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA) and only require a small
   land area for equipment location. An ESS has the capability to provide mission debriefings
   detailing individual aircrew or large force analysis/feedback on the effectiveness of ECM and
   threat avoidance procedures.
   5.1.2. Electronic Combat Ranges (ECRs) are collocated with ranges or in close proximity to
   MOAs, MTRs, and other SUA. All ECRs have the capability to provide analysis/feedback on
   the effectiveness of package or individual aircrew ECM and/or threat avoidance procedures.
   ECRs provide a limited or robust EC training capability and consist of multiple
   geographically separated threat emitters coordinated to simulate an Integrated Air Defense
   System (IADS). Mobile emitters are used to provide scenario flexibility.
   5.1.3. EC Personnel Training. To provide a realistic threat environment for aircrew combat
   training, ECR/ESS electronic threat operators will have a working knowledge of EC doctrine
   and employment concepts.
       5.1.3.1. Training Programs. Management criteria, administrative practices, and training
       policies required to conduct a comprehensive ECR/ESS training program will include
       academics and practical application in live and simulated environments. ECR/ESS
       personnel should be familiar with applicable MAJCOM training events and requirements
       defined in AFI 11-2MDSv1s and Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Tasking Messages.
       5.1.3.1. (AFSOC) All personnel who operate or maintain Electronic Combat (EC) threat
       simulators and visual cueing systems will be trained in a unit or contractor-developed
       training program. Training records will be maintained by hard copy or electronic means.
           5.1.3.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Familiarization.           Conduct a one-time orientation
           covering the mission, organization, equipment/system familiarization, safety and
           security at the operating location. All newly assigned ECR personnel will receive
           familiarization training no later than 30 working days after arrival on site. Personnel
           will not operate any threat simulator or UHF/VHF radio for aircrew training until
           they have completed this training. Orientation/training will be documented in the
           individual’s training record referenced in 5.1.3.1. above.
           5.1.3.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) Operator Training. Hands-on operator/maintenance
           training for the specific threat simulator, radio, or visual cueing system will be
 48                                             AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


          documented in the individual’s training record (referenced in 5.1.3.1. above) and
          personnel evaluated to demonstrate proficiency before they are considered qualified.
          5.1.3.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) Recurring Training. The ROA or site manager will
          determine the need for recurring training, e.g. to keep current on the latest operations
          tactics and techniques or when threat equipment operations procedures change. New
          or recurring training will be documented in individual’s training record (referenced in
          5.1.3.1. above).
       5.1.3.2. Responsibilities. ROAs are responsible for the selection and written designation
       of instructor personnel who will conduct site training for government personnel. The unit
       training officer/site manager is responsible for developing the unit training programs,
       training schedules, quarterly and annual unit training plans, and lesson plans, and is the
       unit approving authority for all unit-developed training courses or programs. For
       contractor run operations, the contract must specify the minimum training requirements.
   5.1.4. (Added-AFSOC) Range Integration Instrumentation System (RIIS). The RIIS
   provides an unclassified debriefing capability for EC training. Range data is collected,
   processed and analyzed, and delivered back to the aircrews for mission replay on standard
   desktop computers. Conduct RIIS operations IAW RIIS User Manual, available on the HQ
   ACC/A3AR CoP. Sites will coordinate closely with the RIIS Operations Center (ROC) for
   timely, accurate data processing.
5.2. Electronic Combat Equipment Management. EC range equipment consists of SAM and
AAA emitter/simulators, Smokey SAM training rockets and associated EC threat systems (See
Attachment 1 for emitter/simulator definition). Reference the RMAST Wiki website for special
equipment and systems used to simulate enemy threats, or AFI 99-109 for threat system
configuration management under test auspices as a MRTFB.
   5.2.1. Requests for Threat System Additions, Reallocation or Modification. IAW AFI 10-
   901, Lead Operating Command--Communications and Information Systems Management,
   HQ ACC is the designated lead command for all requests for new/additional range threat
   emitters, simulators, and systems. Development of new threats systems will be approved by
   the CTR Executive Review. The affected MAJCOMs will mutually agree upon requests for
   reallocation of threat systems and AF/A3O-AR will arbitrate any disputes. See AFI 99-109
   for test procedures.
   5.2.1. (AFSOC) HQ ACC/A3A in coordination with HQ AFSOC/A3A directs the
   movement/transfer of all MAFR EC threat systems. Before additions and/or transfer threat
   systems to/from their inventory, the ROA will validate the request by official correspondence
   to HQ AFSOC/A3A. The request must include the number and type of systems required,
   changes to the wing mission that justify the additions/transfer, and confirmation of
   maintenance facilities, funding, and personnel to adequately support the requested systems.
   5.2.2. Requests for Disposition of Equipment. No emitter/simulator will be deactivated,
   transferred, or decommissioned without MAJCOM approval. All deactivation/decommission
   and final disposition requests will be approved by the parent MAJCOM and HQ ACC with
   AF/A3O-AR arbitrating any disputes.
   5.2.2. (AFSOC) HQ ACC is the lead command for all AF electronic combat threat
   equipment and assets. Prior to deactivating or decommissioning any Melrose Range

   Once approved, HQ ACC/A3AR will provide the unit with disposition instructions for the
   equipment.
   5.2.3. Equipment Inventory and Configuration Control. HQ ACC/A3A will develop and
   maintain a system that accurately inventories, tracks equipment, and documents the
   configuration of threat emitters and simulators.
   5.2.3. (AFSOC) HQ ACC/A3A in coordination with HQ AFSOC/A3A approves all
   equipment configuration changes. Submit configuration change requests on AF Form 1067,
   Modification Proposal, IAW procedures in AFI 63-131, Modification Program Management,
   and any ACC supplement.
5.3. Radio Frequency Spectrum Issues. ROAs will identify the frequency spectrum required
for range operation and coordinate requirements with the appropriate Installation Spectrum
Manager. The ROA will ensure that a frequency assignment has been obtained prior to using any
RF emitting equipment.
5.4. Electronic Warfare (EW) Product Improvement Working Group (PIWG). The EW
PIWG is co-chaired by the Range Threat Systems Program Office (SPO), ACC/A3AR, and
ACC/A6OF IAW AFI 21-118, Improving Air and Space Equipment Reliability and
Maintainability (R&M). The primary goals are to interact with and receive feedback from
equipment users, jointly establish priorities for future efforts, develop solutions to R&M
problems, and provide updates concerning on-going efforts.

                    TRACKING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

6.1. Reporting Requirements. AF/A3O-AR in conjunction with the MAJCOMs will develop
and maintain an AF range utilization database to track range use, as well as usage data on
electronic threat, scoring, and instrumentation feedback systems.
6.1. (AFSOC)Reporting Requirements. Use reports to help evaluate the effectiveness of
mission support and facilitate comprehensive range planning. Data collected in support of
various taskings includes, but is not limited to, munitions expended on the range, detailed
airspace and range utilization, weapons scores, and maintenance data. Include munitions
expended by ground/joint SOF users by unit, type, and support for their operation). Utilization
reports will be submitted to HQ AFSOC/A3AR for monthly, quarterly and consolidated annual
analysis. Maintain a 3-year historical archive of all reports. The ROA will submit reports to
ensure government review; contractors must not submit reports directly to HQ AFSOC. Submit
all reports to HQ AFSOC/A3AR no later than (NLT) the 5th working day of the month following
the end of the reporting period.
   6.1.1. Classified Data. If required, submit classified information separately from unclassified
   data.
   6.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) The ROA will ensure a monthly Weapons Range Activity Report
   is compiled. The MAFR range operations officer/contract range supervisor will maintain
   accurate records of range operation and maintenance time plus closures and cancellations to
   assist in making accurate monthly reports. The ROO/contract range supervisor will submit
   the completed form to the ROA at the end of each range week.
6.2. Range Utilization Reporting. Utilization reporting requirements will be directed by
periodic publishing of a ―Range Utilization Tasking Memo‖ which can be obtained from the
library on the USAF RMAST website.
6.3. Expended Munitions Tracking. IAW Title 40 CFR, §266, Military Munitions, DoDD
4715.11, Environmental and Explosives Safety Management on Operational Ranges Within the
United States, and DoDD 4715.12, ROAs will maintain records of all expenditures (types,
quantities, locations, using organization, and estimated dud rates) of ammunition and explosives
for each target. ROAs will maintain those records as required by AFMAN 33-363.
6.3. (AFSOC)Expended Munitions Tracking. Report expended munitions, including Smokey
SAMs, on the AFSOC Range Utilization Report until a replacement system is provided.
Maintain cumulative munitions quantities in support of the installation environmental office
annual Toxic Release Inventory report, to include chaff and flare expenditures. Develop
adequate methods to account for munitions expended on scored, manned, and unmanned ranges.
Locations should be as accurate as possible but may consist of the intended target, range
subdivision, or airspace component.
6.4. Range Clearance Report. This report is a detailed report of clearance events and will
precisely identify the areas that have been cleared and include the number of people and the
amount of money and material used to accomplish the work. When closing or transferring ranges
the range clearance report will be attached to the Certificate of Clearance which becomes an
 52                                             AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


official document certifying that all dangerous and explosive materials reasonably possible to
detect have been removed.
6.4. (AFSOC)Range Clearance Report. Maintain all range clearance reports for the life of the
range. A copy of the EOD range clearance report submitted in the Automated Civil Engineers
System will suffice for the range clearance report, so long as it meets the reporting criteria.
6.5. RAMPOD Configuration Management System. System inventory, configuration and
operational status accounting, utilization, and maintenance data collection are accomplished
using the Reliability, Availability, Maintainability Logistics Engineering Support System for
Pods (RAMPOD) which can be accessed at https://rampod4.robins.af.mil/. The RAMPOD
(G100) data collection system is a PC-compatible, database system that is used to track asset
location, movement (deployment), configuration, utilization, and maintenance status. Field
units/contractors are required to update the database system to reflect any changes in location,
configuration, or maintenance status of ACTS equipment and associated support equipment
(automated test sets, containers, etc). This system provides visibility into the disposition and
configuration of these assets to all levels of command. AFMC and ACC (CAF Lead Command)
provide cooperative insight/oversight for the data management system. The RAMPOD system
policies and procedures apply to CAF, AETC, AFRC, and ANG units utilizing ACTS pods.
   6.5.1. Purpose. RAMPOD provides a viable means to collect and report the necessary data to
   maximize ACTS mission capability and sortie effectiveness, reduce the cost of ownership,
   manage system configuration inventory, and compile reliability and maintainability factors to
   support ongoing product support and improvement initiatives. RAMPOD provides regularly
   updated and verified inventory, status, and maintenance data for users at all levels of the Air
   Force community.
   6.5.2. Responsibilities. RAMPOD receives funding through its own PMD and PE 27040F.
   Direction for implementation of RAMPOD is provided in AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
   Equipment Maintenance Management and AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and
   Utilization Reporting. MAJCOMs will provide direction to field units by establishing
   procedures and contractual vehicles to ensure data is submitted to RAMPOD as required.
   WR-ALC/ITM will collect maintenance data for Reliability and Maintainability (R&M),
   warranties, and other information as deemed necessary to function as the system of record for
   Air Force pods.
   6.5.3. Policy. ACC/A3A will work day-to-day issues and any additional changes to
   approved plans for asset transfer. AF/A3O-AR will arbitrate any unresolved differences.
   Under no circumstances will units move system equipment either on a temporary or
   permanent basis without documentation in the RAMPOD and appropriate resource
   management system.
   6.5.4. Temporary Transfer. Units may coordinate temporary (no transfer of ownership) inter-
   unit equipment loans (lateral support) to fulfill contingency requirements. Temporary loans
   will be annotated by the lending unit in the RAMPOD database NLT the date of transfer and
   all transfers will include projected return dates. Shipping costs will be the responsibility of
   the gaining unit. Pods will be returned in the same maintenance status as they were received.
   6.5.5. Permanent Transfer. Units requesting additional system equipment or related support
   equipment to fulfill mission requirements on a permanent basis (transfer of ownership) will
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                         53


   attempt to resolve these requests inter-MAJCOM. The coordinated request will be forwarded
   to ACC/A3A. Shipping costs will be the responsibility of the gaining unit. Additionally, the
   CTR Executive Review members will coordinate with ACC/A3A, who will provide final
   distribution plans for new production pods/test-sets to AAC/YBR.
   6.5.6. New Requirements. Unfulfilled requirements will be forwarded to ACC/A3A through
   Realistic Training Review Board (RTRB) or CTR using AF Form 1067, Modification
   Proposal.
6.6. (Added-AFSOC) Range Readiness Report (RRR). This unclassified report enables the
Relevant Range Strategic Vision by assessing each range’s ability to support the training
requirements of the Combat Air Forces as well as primary users. The RRR assigns each range
Mission Essential Task (MET) a stoplight color code. The report is a snapshot of the previous 3
months along with a 3 month projection of anticipated yellow or red items. Any red coded item
must provide an estimated ―get-well‖ date. Submit the RRR quarterly at the end of March, June,
September, and December. Assess whether the following METs support the range users’ needs:
   6.6.1. (Added-AFSOC) Targets and target arrays.            Are targets relevant, realistic,
   challenging, and cost-effective?
   6.6.2. (Added-AFSOC) Electronic threats.         Are threat systems relevant, realistic,
   challenging, and cost effective?
   6.6.3. (Added-AFSOC) Scoring and feedback systems. Do systems provide meaningful
   information to support the warfighting cycle (See-Assess-Decide-Act)?
   6.6.4. (Added-AFSOC) Adequate hours of operation. Is the range and airspace available at
   appropriate times and of sufficient duration to meet users’ needs?
   6.6.5. (Added-AFSOC) Infrastructure.       Is the real property, facilities, utilities and
   communications infrastructure adequate to allow the range to support its users?
   6.6.6. (Added-AFSOC) Environmental stewardship. Does the range manage, cooperate on,
   and act to improve all aspects of the natural infrastructure for long-term sustainability?
   6.6.7. (Added-AFSOC) Adequate airspace/land. Does the ROA own, lease or otherwise
   control access to land overlaid by safety footprints? Is there adequate airspace volume to
   meet training and safety requirements? Are airspace and ranges located within a reasonable
   distance of the installation/primary user?
6.7. (Added-AFSOC) Fiscal Reports. The ROA will submit quarterly fiscal year spending
reports to HQ AFSOC/A3AR. The report short include actual quarterly obligations and an
estimate by quarter of projected costs.

              RANGE MAINTENANCE AND CLEARANCE OPERATIONS

7.1. Range Maintenance. Ranges will be constructed and maintained in compliance with
AF/A3O-AR approved range construction and maintenance methods as described on the
RMAST wiki site which will be periodically updated with best practices and field inputs.
7.2. Range Clearance. Each MAJCOM/ROA is responsible for the clearance of operational
ranges under its control IAW DoDI 3200.16, Operational Range Clearance, DoDI 4140.62,
Management and Disposition of Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard
(MPPEH), and Title 40 CFR, Parts 260-270. Furthermore, each MAJCOM/ROA must dispose of
radioactive wastes IAW the Air Force Radioactive and Mixed Waste Office (AFRMWO) and
AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force.
   7.2.1. Funding and Scheduling Range Clearances. The ROA is responsible for funding and
   scheduling all MPPEH/range clearance, and should include clearance activities in the CRP.
   The ROA should publish a clearance schedule on the range web page IAW paragraph 2.5.13.
   The ROA or ROO may temporarily postpone range clearance on a case-by-case basis for
   severe weather or other unforeseen circumstances that warrant delays.
   7.2.1. (AFSOC) The ROA will submit exemptions/waivers IAW paragraph 1.5. for
   cancellation of the clearance or modification of range clearance criteria. A cancellation
   occurs when a clearance cannot be performed before the next scheduled clearance of the
   same type, e.g. a semi-annual clearance, regardless of any intervening, less restrictive
   clearance. A postponement occurs if the clearance can be performed before the next required
   clearance of the same type.
   7.2.2. EOD Support for Range Clearances. When the requirement for range clearance
   support exceeds the capability of the associated EOD unit, shortfalls are managed within the
   ACES Range Support Tasking (RST) program.
       7.2.2.1. Development of the annual range clearance plan will be a collaborative effort
       between the ROA and the associate EOD unit (or MAJCOM) finalized at least six months
       prior to the first clearance activity. The associate EOD unit (or MAJCOM) will enter
       RST requests into ACES as required to meet clearance requirements.
       7.2.2.2. Finalize all ROA range scheduling and EOD RST support at least 45 days before
       the start of the clearance operation.
7.3. Range Clearance Operations. Range clearance includes the removal or disposal of all
ordnance, inert ordnance debris, Training Projectile (TP) ammunition, and other range debris
reasonably possible to detect (normally down to four inches in size).
   7.3.1. Ordnance Removal and Disposal. Normally, only EOD Personnel will perform
   explosive operations (detonation/energetic material destruction). When a fully coordinated
   waiver or exemption has been approved by AF/A3O-AR, UXO-Qualified Personnel may
   perform limited explosives operations (venting or disposing of practice bombs) in areas of
   ranges that have never been used for live munitions. (Reference Attachment 1 for EOD
   Personnel and UXO-Qualified Personnel definitions).
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                            55


     7.3.1. (AFSOC) Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) are military personnel, Unexploded
     Ordnance (UXO)-qualified personnel are non-military personnel.
        7.3.1.1. Warning: Except for training gun ammunition on targets designated solely for
        that use, and expended Smokey Sam missile simulators, non-EOD Personnel will not
        move or attempt to move munitions unless they have been marked ―safe to move‖ by
        EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified Personnel.
        7.3.1.2. Warning: Non-EOD Personnel will not remove, move or process a used target
        until is has been marked ―safe to move‖ by EOD Personnel following thorough
        inspection to ensure that no UXO is present in target debris.
        7.3.1.3. Warning: Range clearance operations are prohibited when snow covers the
        ground. However, if specifically authorized in the MAJCOM supplement, range
        maintenance (placement of new targets, target maintenance, removal, and replacement)
        may be authorized during these periods.
        7.3.1.4. (Added-AFSOC) Any use of explosives by UXO-qualified personnel will only
        be permitted after a Site Specific Safety Plan (SSSP) is approved by HQ
        AFSOC/SEW/A7X/A3A. The plan will address all aspects of the explosive operations,
        to include those listed in Table 7.1, Site Specific Safety Plan. The SSSP is valid for the
        duration of the contract or until operational procedures change.

  [R3]) is normally accomplished by UXO-qualified contractors. Bases must institutionalize a
  chain of custody process for MPPEH from collection to final disposition. This is particularly
  necessary when two or more agencies (e.g., military and contracted) are involved in the
  MPPEH process.
  7.3.3. (AFSOC) Range material (target debris, munitions and munitions debris) which has
  been fired upon is considered MPPEH until properly inspected and certified to be safe. Once
  certified, this material is no longer considered MPPEH so long as the chain of custody is
  maintained until released from DOD control.
     7.3.3.1. EOD Personnel will brief non-EOD personnel augmenting range clearance on
     the possible hazards and the safe handling of debris. EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified
     Personnel will inspect ordnance debris. Debris will be double-inspected or subjected to a
     mechanized process to ensure MPPEH is not released to the public.
     7.3.3.2. To prevent co-mingling, segregate processed and inspected MPPEH awaiting
     disposal from MPPEH awaiting processing and inspection. Segregation may be
     accomplished by any means that ensures physical separation and controlled access (e.g.,
     bins, buildings, or fenced compounds under lock and key).
     7.3.3.2. (AFSOC) Secure MPPEH in a Residue Holding Area (RHA) until final
     disposition. The RHA will have appropriate administrative/physical controls to limit
     access and must be located outside any WDZ Footprint. All range residues will be
     checked and approved for movement by qualified EOD/UXO-qualified personnel prior to
     placement in the RHA. Segregate residues according to type, such as full scale practice
     munitions, sub-scale practice munitions, light metal, and commercial grade vehicles,
     armored vehicles, Smokey SAMs, non-recyclable residue, etc.
     7.3.3.3. Disposal of MPPEH may be accomplished by any means consistent with DoDI
     4140.62 and may be accomplished by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service
     (DRMS) under a MOA or through direct commercial sales or contracts.
     7.3.3.3. (AFSOC) MPPEH shall be processed to ensure explosive safety,
     demilitarization and environmental requirements are met before this material is released
     from DOD control. This process shall leave munitions and munitions residue in a
     condition where they will not be recognizable as munitions, allows for full inspection of
     the interior to ensure no explosive hazard remains, and typically prepares the material
     into an industry standard form. Use DOD 4160.21-M, Defense Material Disposition
     Manual, and DOD 4160.21-M-1, Defense Demilitarization Manual, to ensure proper
     demilitarization is accomplished. All processed material will be accompanied by a
     Range Residue Disposition Document, DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt
     Document, or locally generated documentation (see Attachment 11) and certification
     statements will only be signed by qualified personnel.
         7.3.3.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) Sub-scale practice bombs (e.g., bomb dummy unit ) and
         other sub-scale practice munitions, expended rockets and warheads, inert projectiles;
         guided missile parts and guided bomb components will be run through a process that
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                        57


        reduces these items into 4-inch pieces or smaller and unrecognizable as munitions
        items.
        7.3.3.3.2. (Added-AFSOC) Full-scale inert bombs will be cut into at least four (4)
        pieces (the nose and tail portions of the bomb must be cut off). Filler materials will
        be removed.
        7.3.3.3.3. (Added-AFSOC) Third Party UXO QA. For contracted range residue
        removal (R3) operations, no site activity will take place without third party UXO QA
        personnel on-site. The UXO QA will have "stop work" authority and will monitor
        the UXO actions to ensure project compliance and safety. The third party UXO QA
        must be a UXO Technician III or equivalent IAW the DDESB Technical Paper 18
        (EOD must be at least a 7-skill level) or government personnel who are authorized to
        sign munitions residue inspections IAW T.O. 11A-1-60, General Instructions--
        Inspection of Reusable Munitions Containers and Scrap Material Generated from
        Items Exposed to or Containing Explosives. The UXO QA will document custody
        transfer of all residue removed from the range. Active duty and Air Reserve
        Component EOD personnel may perform QAE duties contingent upon availability.
        Requests for military EOD support should be submitted at least 30 days prior to the
        start of operations through appropriate Base Civil Engineer Commanders and HQ
        EOD Functional Managers (ACC/AFRC/ANG).
        7.3.3.3.4. (Added-AFSOC) MPPEH Certification. Range residue will be inspected
        by a UXO Technician to ensure that it is inert and/or free of explosives before any
        processing will occur. No site activity will take place without the presence of
        qualified UXO personnel. The Senior UXO supervisor is responsible for all
        contractor on-site range residue certification activities. This individual shall have
        documented experience with and/or specialized training in the type of
        munitions/ordnance items expected while on each site.
        7.3.3.3.5. (Added-AFSOC) The R3 process requires documented double
        inspections of MPPEH, certification of safe status and demilitarization,
        documentation of the training of personnel responsible for these functions, and
        positive control of the material through final disposition. The ROA must control
        MPPEH until final disposition. If the HQ ACC/R3 contract (or similar contract
        vehicle) is not used the ROA must ensure all requirements are met before disposing
        of range residue.
     7.3.3.4. MPPEH disposal should not be viewed as a funds generating activity.
     Management and disposal of MPPEH must consider safety first. Additionally, AFI 32-
     7080, Pollution Prevention Program, excludes ―ships, planes, or weapons that must
     undergo demilitarization or mutilation before sale‖ from being sold through a qualified
     recycling program. The proceeds from their sale SHALL NOT be returned to a qualified
     recycling program.
  7.3.4. To identify, safeguard, and dispose of UXO, MAJCOMs will ensure that all ROAs
  accomplish the following:
     7.3.4.1. Safely clear UXO from ranges consistent with the stated mission of the
     installation and for the continuing viability of the range. If there is no organic EOD
58                                            AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


     capability, establish a policy agreement document for range clearance support with the
     nearest EOD unit. Resolve all conflicts between explosive safety and other requirements
     with the objective of minimizing explosive hazards. Controlled burning will not be used
     to accomplish UXO clearance, but may be used to support UXO clearance if
     environmental and safety requirements are met.
     7.3.4.2. Prepare a plan for range clearance operations that at a minimum considers the
     number of personnel involved, types of ordnance anticipated to be encountered and/or
     recovered, support requirements, expected levels of contamination. Range clearance plan
     will be coordinated with the supporting EOD unit.
        7.3.4.2.1. ROAs should consider requesting an advanced echelon (ADVON) element
        from the supporting EOD unit to conduct a GPS mapping survey of UXO locations
        and debris-densities/distances around the targets at least two weeks prior to arrival of
        the main body to economize and finalize clearance planning.
     7.3.4.3. Respond promptly to protect personnel and property from any UXO located off a
     military installation IAW AFI 32-3001.
     7.3.4.4. Notify installation personnel and the public, as appropriate, if any range
     operation presents a potential explosive hazard off the range. This includes informing the
     public of any mishap that could influence the local community and may require
     additional precautions and/or restrictions.
     7.3.4.5. Respond immediately to releases or substantial threats of release of hazardous
     UXO constituents, when such release or threat of release poses an imminent and
     substantial threat to human health or the environment IAW DoD Response authorities
     under Title 10 U.S.C. § 2701, Environmental Restoration Program and Title 42 U.S.C. §
     9604, Response Authorities.
     7.3.4.6. On operational ranges, the procedures for evaluating and responding to
     explosives safety, human health, and environmental risks will be IAW Title 40 CFR Parts
     260-270.
     7.3.4.7. Conduct cluster munitions release on designated Impact Areas only and make all
     reasonable attempts to employ inert and live cluster munitions on different targets.
     7.3.4.8. To the maximum extent practicable, designate separate Impact Areas for live and
     inert ordnance training.
     7.3.4.9. IAW AFMAN 33-363, maintain records of:
        7.3.4.9.1. All expenditures (types, quantities, locations, using organization, and
        estimated dud rates) per target of ammunition and explosives IAW DoDD 4715.11.
        7.3.4.9.2. All mishaps attributed to UXO that occur on or off the installation IAW
        DoDI 6055.7, Accident Investigation, Reporting, and Recordkeeping.
        7.3.4.9.3. All EOD incidents or range clearance operations conducted on ranges.
        7.3.4.9.4. All areas known or suspected to contain UXOs using range maps and/or
        installation master planning maps. Conduct historical research as necessary.
     7.3.4.10. Remove all munitions debris from targets awaiting disposal.
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                                59


7.4. Range Clearance Types and Requirements. On active ranges programmed for continued
use, clear the surface of all UXO, MPPEH, and inert debris as described below.
   7.4.1. The following general rules apply to all clearance activities:
      7.4.1.1. Mechanized gathering procedures coordinated with the associated EOD unit and
      approved by the Air Force Safety Center (HQ AFSC) may be used to clear sub-scale
      practice munitions (e.g. BDU-33) as long as un-probed munitions are only handled by
      EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified Personnel.
      7.4.1.2. Only perform subsurface UXO and MPPEH removal as required in current or
      former Hazard Areas for construction, cable burial, etc. Report subsurface MPPEH
      removal and range clearance separately.
      7.4.1.3. Ranges adjacent to the land of another service that prohibits clearance activities
      will be exempt from clearance requirements on those portions when the other service
      provides written acknowledgement of the ramifications. These areas will be considered
      ―Extremely Hazardous Contaminated Impact Areas‖ and handled accordingly by the
      ROA.
      7.4.1.4. ROAs will receive authorization from adjacent facilities prior to
      decontaminating/clearing adjacent impact areas. ROAs will document all access denials
      for clearance activities and report occurrences to the parent MAJCOM and AF/A3O-AR.
      7.4.1.5. Hazard Areas used specifically for live munitions containing extremely
      hazardous fuzing (influence, random-delay, etc.) will be identified as "Extremely
      Hazardous Contaminated Hazard Areas." Range clearance requirements of ―Extremely
      Hazardous Contaminated Hazard Areas‖ will be based on an Environmental, Safety, and
      Occupational Health (ESOH) risk assessment, and if warranted, a waiver or exemption
      request will be accomplished IAW paragraph 1.5 and staffed through the appropriate
      USAF ESOH agencies.
   7.4.2. Low-Angle Strafe Targets. If used for low-angle strafe by aircraft that fly past or over
   the target within 500 feet of the target (slant range), hand-police daily if utilized and clear
   IAW approved range maintenance methods after 15,000 scored rounds (or twelve use-days
   for non-scored targets).
   7.4.3. Improved Conventional Munition (ICM) targets (e.g. CBU grids) are normally cleared
   after accumulating a specific number of weapons. The maximum accumulation amount for
   ICM targets will be specified in the Range CRP and for approval by the MAJCOM with the
   concurrence of AF/A7C. After the maximum accumulation amount is achieved, clear ICM
   targets to the radius where the debris density factor is less than five items per acre and at least
   500 feet from the target.
   7.4.4. Range Clearance Requirements. The sub-paragraphs below define minimum clearance
   requirements; ROAs should consider conducting clearances more frequently or to greater
   radii if required to maintain targets or realistic appearance if EOD support is available.
   During periods of high operations tempo, ROAs should coordinate with their associated EOD
   unit or MAJCOM to synchronize scheduling with AEF deployment cycles.
   7.4.4. (AFSOC) Clear the entire prepared (graded) target area if it exceeds the minimum
   clearance distance to provide a safe working environment for range maintenance activities.
 60                                              AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


      7.4.4.1. As required: Class A, B, and C and MRTFBs. No later than 12 months since last
      accomplished, or when targets are emplaced, replaced or relocated, clear the access ways
      to the target and the area 50 feet on either side of primary target access roads (only those
      roads noted on installation maps and those used for sole access to targets/arrays).
      7.4.4.2. Semi-Annual: Class A and MRTFBs (Except ANG, Edwards AFB, Eglin AFB
      and Pacific Alaskan Range Complex [PARC]). Clear the area around each DMPI
      associated with a target used for weapons expenditure to a radius of 150 feet either a)
      after six months or 150 Use-Days, whichever occurs later, or b) after 20,000 weapons
      have been expended against it. (Note: If two years elapse before the accumulation of
      20,000 weapons, the Semi-Annual requirement is negated by the Biennial requirement in
      paragraph 7.4.4.3 below.)
      7.4.4.3. Biennial: Class A, B, C and MRTFBs. No later than two years since last
      accomplished, clear the area around a target used for weapons expenditure as follows:
          7.4.4.3.1. Clear targets not used for live munitions to either a) a radius of 300 feet or
          b) the shorter radius where the debris density factor is less than five items per acre.
          7.4.4.3.2. Clear live munitions targets to either a) a radius of 500 feet or b) the
          shorter radius where the debris density factor is less than five items per acre.
      7.4.4.4. Decennial: Class A, B, and C. No later than 10 years since last accomplished,
      clear the area around a target used for weapons expenditure to either a) a radius of 1,000
      feet or b) the shorter radius where the density of debris items is less than five per acre.
      ROAs may elect to clear all areas within 1,000 feet of targets every ten years and may do
      so incrementally (e.g. 20% of the required area biennially for ten years).
   7.4.5. (Added-AFSOC) Radiological Survey.               Perform a radiological survey, in
   coordination with the IRSO, of all target debris from military hardware/equipment before
   removal from the range unless a radiological survey is documented under the target
   management program. Radiological detection equipment will be operated by appropriately
   trained personnel. Pay particular attention to aircraft components, dials, gauges, tank starting
   units, etc., to determine if radioactive components are present. If radioactive components are
   found, remove, segregate, and package radioactive items. Consult the IRSO for proper
   handling and disposition requirements.
      Note: Be aware that the level of radioactivity allowed by smelters and scrap yards is less
      than that allowed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, U.S. Atomic Energy
      Commission Regulatory Guide 1.86, Table 1.
7.5. Range Maintenance and Clearance Safety.
   7.5.1. Warning: Except for training gun ammunition on targets designated solely for that
   use, and expended Smokey Sam missile simulators, non-EOD Personnel will not move or
   attempt to move munitions unless they have been marked ―safe to move‖ by EOD Personnel
   or UXO-Qualified Personnel. ―Safe to move‖ may be indicated by any readily
   distinguishable means that is mutually agreeable to EOD and the ROA.
      7.5.1.1. All personnel engaged in range operations must receive ground and explosive
      safety briefings.
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                         61


      7.5.1.2. Augmenting EOD Personnel must receive orientation on range vehicle
      operation, ordnance expected to be encountered, emergency procedures, and local range
      safety briefings.
      7.5.1.3. Brief non-EOD personnel assisting in range clearance IAW AFMAN 91-201,
      Explosive Safety Standards, to include the markings used for practice and inert ordnance
      and the hazards they may encounter.
      7.5.1.3. (AFSOC) Document non-EOD range clearance safety briefings IAW sample
      EOD Briefing Statement at Attachment 12.
   7.5.2. Warning: Range clearance operations are prohibited when snow covers the ground.
   However, if specifically authorized in the MAJCOM supplement, range maintenance
   (placement of new targets, target maintenance, removal, and replacement) may be authorized
   during these periods.
   7.5.3. Safety Training. Exercise extreme caution when working within Hazard Areas to
   preclude inadvertent detonation of UXO. ROAs and EOD will ensure the following safety
   training/briefings are provided.
      7.5.3.1. All personnel engaged in range operations must receive ground and explosive
      safety briefings.
      7.5.3.2. Augmenting EOD Personnel must receive orientation on range vehicle
      operation, ordnance expected to be encountered, emergency procedures, and local range
      safety briefings.
      7.5.3.3. Brief non-EOD personnel assisting in range clearance IAW AFMAN 91-201,
      Explosive Safety Standards, to include the markings used for practice and inert ordnance
      and the hazards they may encounter.
   7.5.4. In addition to Chapter 4 communications requirements, each working team must have
   a signaling device for use in the event an uninformed flight crew attempts to use the range.
   7.5.5. All contractor personnel must adhere to OSHA and/or DoD 4145.26-M, DoD
   Contractors’ Safety Manual for Ammunition and Explosives, as applicable.
7.6. Range Operations during Range Maintenance and Clearance. Unless further restricted
by MAJCOM or local range supplements, during maintenance and range clearance adhere to the
additional restrictions below.
   7.6.1. Class A Range Operations. Range maintenance and clearance operations can be
   conducted on one side of a dual Class A range (except behind strafe targets) while the RCO
   is controlling aircrew training missions on the other side of the range.
   7.6.2. Class B and C Range Operations. Class B and C ranges are normally closed during
   maintenance and clearance operations, but if the range is of sufficient size the ROA may
   authorize continued operations on portions of the range (and adjacent ranges) with the
   approval of the EOD team chief. If approved, the ROA will brief aircrews concerning the
   location of ground personnel and emphasize the absolute need for certain target
   identification.
   7.6.3. Over flight Procedures. Over flight is not authorized without the concurrence of the
   ground party and RCO/ROO approval over areas or portions of ranges during maintenance
62                                             AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


  and clearance operations. This ensures the protection of ground personnel and prevents
  aircraft damage by fragments from explosives operations. Strict adherence to the procedures
  outlined below is mandatory.
     7.6.3.1. When range maintenance or clearance personnel are present on the range and
     explosives operations are not planned, aircraft will remain at or above 3,000’ AGL unless
     a lower altitude is specifically approved by the ground party and RCO or ROO.
     7.6.3.2. When explosives operations are planned, aircraft will remain at or above 7,000’
     AGL to ensure containment of H-6 fill Mk-84 fragmentation.
     7.6.3.3. When no personnel are on the range, but the range is closed for maintenance or
     clearance operations, aircraft operations may proceed with no additional altitude
     restrictions, but only simulated weapons deliveries IAW applicable directives, and eye
     safe laser operations are authorized during range maintenance and range clearance
     closures. All restrictions will be clearly identified in the range schedule and reinforced by
     range NOTAMS.
     7.6.3.4. Chaff and flares are prohibited below 5,000’ AGL above range clearance
     operations.
     7.6.3.5. Do not conduct supersonic flight below 10,000’ MSL over or within 5NM of
     EOD operations.

      program include: UTTR; Eglin AFB; Kwajalein Test Range; Alaska Test Range; and
      Tonopah Test Range. Reliability certification flight test activities at Vandenberg AFB,
      Nellis AFB, Whiteman AFB, and Barksdale AFB are limited to carrier/weapon interface
      and launch only.
      8.3.2.2. Use of DU for reliability certification flight tests is authorized under AF auspices
      by Section 91(b) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and falls under the jurisdiction of HQ
      AFSC/SEW.
8.4. Disposal/Decommission Procedures.
   8.4.1. Disposal of Expended DU Penetrators. Expended DU penetrators and visible
   fragments will be collected, packaged, and disposed of in coordination with the Installation
   Radiation Safety Officer and the Air Force RIC. Before commencing clearance actions, an
   EOD team will sweep the Impact Area and ―safe‖ any UXO. Annually, authorized personnel
   will manually remove visible DU rounds and fragments, and package them for disposal (see
   paragraph 8.4.1.2).
      8.4.1.1. Authorized Personnel. Personnel trained in DU hazards and wearing the
      appropriate personal protective equipment, as determined by a qualified health physicist
      and the Installation Radiation Safety Officer, will remove penetrators and fragments.

      NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT AND ENCROACHMENT
                          PREVENTION

9.1. Range Natural Infrastructure Management & Encroachment Prevention. In order to
ensure mission readiness, adequate natural infrastructure (air, land, water, and frequency
spectrum) are needed to test, train, and perform the Air Force’s varied missions at its ranges.
These resources can be degraded or denied in some locations due to environmental issues or
encroachment. Encroachment comes in many forms, but often results in diminished operations or
significant workarounds, inconveniences, and additional costs of doing business. Therefore, it is
important to maintain natural infrastructure and protect against encroachment wherever possible
to meet operational requirements.
   9.1.1. In order to document and track efforts to sustain, restore and modernize (SRM) the
   natural infrastructure to ensure operational capability, each range in conjunction with a multi-
   disciplinary team, including wing civil engineering, safety, EOD, legal, etc., shall develop
   and maintain a CRP as discussed in paragraph 3.2.4.
   9.1.2. The CRP will document encroachment issues, both internally and externally, for
   ranges and associated airspace describing impacts on the mission. Internal factors include,
   but are not limited to, wetlands, threatened and endangered (T/E) species, hazardous waste
   sites, frequency spectrum, and UXO. External factors include, but are not limited to,
   incompatible land use zoning, frequency spectrum restrictions, and local and regional
   environmental constraints. The ROA will work with the surrounding federal, state, and local
   governments to minimize external encroachments.
   9.1.3. Regulatory compliance is necessary and desirable. Protection of human health;
   conservation of wetlands and endangered species; and conservation of cultural resources are
   essential range management activities. Compliance activities and attendant metrics, however,
   do not provide an adequate measure of program management effectiveness absent a clear
   linkage to operational requirements. Therefore, it is Air Force policy to sustain, restore, and
   modernize our natural infrastructure over its useful life to ensure adequate resource capability
   for the warfighter and to minimize encroachment. Protection of human health and conserving
   cultural and natural resources are inherent in this requirement.
9.2. Integrated Natural and Cultural Resources Program. Air Force ranges will conserve
natural resources pursuant to the Sikes Act and other applicable laws and regulations. The
cultural resources program will be implemented by an approved ICRMP. The INRMP is the sole
tool for implementing the military installation natural resources program. The ICRMP is the sole
tool for implementing the military cultural resources program. Each INRMP and ICRMP will be
written IAW AFI 32-7064 and AFI 32-7065 to support the current and future known mission
requirements identified in the CRP and will be amended as mission requirements change
significantly.
9.2. (AFSOC)Integrated Natural and Cultural Resources Program. Develop range-related
portions of the Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan, Integrated Cultural Resources
Management Plan and their subordinate plans in coordination with the ROA or equivalent range
 66                                             AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


representative (e.g. RM). Ensure all pertinent installation offices review these plans, and then
forward the plans to HQ AFSOC/A3AR for coordination prior to final signature.
9.3. Environmental Compliance, Conservation, and Pollution Prevention.
   9.3.1. Environmental Compliance. Air Force ranges will conduct their activities according to
   national environmental policy and meet environmental compliance guidelines set forth in
   AFI 32-7047, Environmental Compliance Tracking and Reporting, and DoDI 4715.6,
   Environmental Compliance. The Air Force will comply with applicable Federal, State, and
   local environmental laws and standards. Air Force activities in foreign countries will comply
   with the DoD Final Governing Standards, or in their absence, the environmental criteria of
   the DoD Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document.
   9.3.2. Conservation and Pollution Prevention. The Air Force will conserve natural and
   cultural resources through effective environmental planning. The Air Force will prevent
   future pollution by reducing use of hazardous materials and releases of pollutants into the
   environment through source reduction, recycling, and hazardous material substitutions.
   Commanders at all levels as well as all Air Force employees are responsible for full
   compliance with national and Air Force environmental policy and are accountable for the
   environmental consequences of their actions.
   9.3.3. Military Munitions Rule (MMR). The regulations governing the cradle-to-grave
   management of hazardous waste are codified in Title 40 CFR Parts 260-270. The portion of
   those regulations that determine when military munitions become solid waste and provide
   standards for their management as hazardous waste are codified in Title 40 CFR , Part 266,
   Subpart M, ―Military Munitions‖ (40 CFR §§ 266.200 -- 266.206). MAJCOMs/ROAs will
   comply with the standards established in the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA)
   MMR to meet EPA regulatory requirements on active and inactive ranges. Ensure
   environmental management flights are involved in the process.
   9.3.4. Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard (MPPEH). MAJCOMs/ROAs
   should manage active and inactive ranges under their control to maintain long-term viability
   of DoD ranges while protecting human health and the environment and to minimize future
   clearance costs. Ranges and munitions should be designed to minimize potential explosive
   hazards and harmful environmental impacts and to promote resource recovery and recycling.
   Each MAJCOM/ROA will comply with DoDI 4140.62 and DoDD 4715.11 and 4715.12.
9.4. Programming Guidance. Eligible environmental requirements shall be identified for
funding in ACES. The ranges should be projecting environmental requirements in POM
submissions. Your host installation Civil Engineer (CE) Environmental Office can assist you in
identifying projects eligible for environmental funding versus environmentally related
operational requirements that must be funded with the ranges operations and maintenance funds.
9.5. Environmental Database. It is critical for the Air Force Operational Range Environmental
Program to have an accurate database of environmental attributes of operational ranges. This
database supports informed and accurate environmental resource decisions to sustain our
operational ranges into the future. Each range shall respond to annual data calls and provide the
requested information in coordination with the host CE squadron/environmental office.
9.6. Operational Range Environmental Assessment Program. Ranges shall work with the
host CE squadron/environmental shop to conduct operational range munitions constituent

                   AFSOC FORMAT FOR THE RANGE ADDENDUM

A4.1. (Added) Local Range Addendum.
   A4.1.1. (Added) Because the content of the local range addendum will likely interface with
   other wing/base activities, the local range addendum should be published at wing/base level.
   A4.1.2. (Added) Local addenda will be submitted to HQ AFSOC/A3AR for review prior to
   ROA publication. Note: OPRs must contact their host base or unit publishing activity for
   formatting guidance prior to developing an addendum. Failure to do so may cause otherwise
   unnecessary rework.

                               Attachment 9 (Added-AFSOC)
                     SMOKEY SAM/SMOKEY GUN OPERATIONS

A9.1. (Added-AFSOC) Safety Requirements. All persons will be trained prior to performing
launch operations.
   A9.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Simulators will be handled, transported, and stored IAW
   AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards, T.O. 11L1-2-23-1 and local procedures.
   Contractors transporting simulators over public roads will meet Department of
   Transportation hazardous material transportation requirements.
   A9.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) The RCO, or responsible person delegated by the ROA, will
   verify favorable launch conditions prior to beginning operations, e.g., current fire danger,
   weather conditions, etc. Terminate launch operations immediately if weather conditions
   become unfavorable.
   A9.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) The LSS will have direct communications with the RCO and/or
   Mission Director. Terminate launch operations immediately if any condition arises that
   could present a hazard.
   A9.1.4. (Added-AFSOC) All personnel involved in launcher loading and/or unloading
   operations will wear full face protection, leather gloves, shirt with sleeves rolled down.
   A9.1.5. (Added-AFSOC) Angle the launcher away from the aircraft flight path, if known,
   or with the direction of the wind to prevent a FOD hazard.
   A9.1.6. (Added-AFSOC) The minimum safe distance for Smokey SAM launches against
   inbound, low-level altitude, fixed-wing aircraft is approximately 2 miles. This will allow the
   rocket to fall to the ground before the aircraft overflies the target. The minimum safe
   distance for all other activities is 2,000 feet.
   A9.1.7. (Added-AFSOC) The LSS will control the Fire Control Assembly Enable Plug or
   the Fire Control Assembly when the Enable Plug is installed and the launcher is armed.
   A9.1.8. (Added-AFSOC) Do not launch/initiate simulators without direct view of the
   launch site and surrounding airspace.
   A9.1.9. (Added-AFSOC) All personnel shall remain the full length of the control cable
   away from the launch site. Control cables must not be less than 100 feet long, prior to
   launching/initiating simulators.
A9.2. (Added-AFSOC) The LSS must ensure the following before launching Smokey
SAMs:
   A9.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) Access routes to the launch site are blocked and warning signs
   are posted.
   A9.2.2. (Added-AFSOC) The launch site and immediate area is clear of personnel and
   vehicle traffic.
   A9.2.3. (Added-AFSOC) Receive a ―Clear to Fire‖ call from the RCO/Mission Director.
   A9.2.4. (Added-AFSOC) Visually acquire the target aircraft.
 104                                              AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


A9.3. (Added-AFSOC) Collection and Disposal. Collect spent simulators to minimize litter on
the range and ensure proper disposal.
   A9.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) Collect expended igniter rods and rockets that can reasonably be
   recovered without placing personnel at risk. Ensure launch areas are included in the range
   decontamination schedule for EOD personnel to collect rockets that could not be recovered
   due to missions, terrain, or other hazards. Recover all Smokey SAMs that land off DoD
   property.
   A9.3.2. (Added-AFSOC) Handle and dispose of spent simulators as MPPEH IAW Chapter
   7. Place collected items in the residue holding area separate from any inspected range
   residue, labeled, and secured to prevent inadvertent or unauthorized additions.
A9.4. (Added-AFSOC) Remote Controlled Launches.
   A9.4.1. (Added-AFSOC) Launch Site Access. Follow live-fire target entry procedures for
   ground party access to remote launch sites on active targets. All rocket loading operations
   will be scheduled in advance and identified on range operations schedules. Do not allow
   aircraft to overfly the launch area during launcher loading operations. Do not leave
   launchers and rockets unattended overnight or in areas frequented by non-DoD personnel.
   Post a minimum of four warning signs around the launch site equally spaced, starting from
   the primary entry point or direction.
   A9.4.2. (Added-AFSOC) Minimum operating distances. The launch crew will position
   themselves outside of the WDZ footprint. The LSS should exercise caution when launching
   against helicopter/tilt rotors to ensure the launch occurs before the target enters the 2,000 foot
   safety bubble.
   A9.4.3. (Added-AFSOC) The RCO will confirm remote control Smokey SAM operations
   with the aircrew during check-in to include launcher locations and number of passes
   requiring launch activity. Use binoculars or Night Vision Goggles to help visually acquire
   the aircraft.
   A9.4.4. (Added-AFSOC) Instrumented ranges may use video cameras to monitor the
   launch site so long as the fields of view encompass the 2,000 foot safe distance, to include
   the airspace.
   A9.4.5. (Added-AFSOC) Consider other factors such as Joint Terminal Attack Controller
   operations, helicopter/tilt rotor tactics, terrain, etc., before allowing remote controlled
   launches.
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                            105


                               Attachment 10 (Added-AFSOC)
                                  ECR/ESS OPERATIONS

A10.1. (Added-AFSOC) ECR/ESS Operations. These operating procedures represent the
continuation of operating procedures where training requirements have changed or responsible
organizations deactivated, and which do not exist in official publications, technical orders, or
equipment manuals. Send recommendations to add, delete, or change these procedures to the
HQ AFSOC/A3AR who will review and forward to ACC/A3AR Threats Team.
A10.2. (Added-AFSOC) Low-level/MTR Activity.
A10.3. (Added-AFSOC) Site Operations. Sites may perform unscheduled equipment
maintenance during vulnerability periods, but must maintain a 30-minute recovery capability.
Check the range schedule prior to these maintenance sessions and notify the scheduling office
stating current status. Coordinate non-routine maintenance activities at least 1 week prior if a
30-minute recovery capability cannot be maintained. The ROO must approve maintenance
downtime in coordination with the site QAE.
   A10.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) Wings should provide the site with all necessary information
   prior to the activity. Aircrews should relay information at initial contact to identify activity
   when run information is not previously provided.
   A10.3.2. (Added-AFSOC) Maintain all operations-related publications and directives.
   This includes updating operations read files, ensuring standardized aids are current, and
   ensuring directives are readily available to personnel. Recommend sites maintain a static call
   sign listing of all ACC wings (normally furnished by the Command Post or Base
   Operations).
   A10.3.3. (Added-AFSOC) Site management will perform a quality review of all activity.
   Operations personnel shall provide justification to site management and the QAE if requested
   activity is not provided.
A10.4. (Added-AFSOC) Communications Procedures. Communications between the site
and aircraft is necessary but must be kept to an absolute minimum. When aircraft operate under
the control of Ground Control Intercept, follow AFI 11-214, Air Operations and Procedures,
guidelines for air-to-ground communications.
   A10.4.1. (Added-AFSOC) Complete the Local Work Cards on UHF/VHF communications
   equipment prior to beginning the operations period. The work cards verify frequencies,
   receiver squelch levels, and front panel meter readings of UHF radios.
   A10.4.2. (Added-AFSOC) Monitor the communications recorder during readability checks
   to ensure it is recording satisfactorily. Make voice actuated recordings on at least one
   channel throughout the scheduled vulnerability period. Accomplish the initial check for the
   scoring shift prior to the start of shift operations period.
   A10.4.3. (Added-AFSOC) Verify all applicable clocks are set to the correct time. Monitor
   clock accuracy throughout the vulnerability period.
   A10.4.4. (Added-AFSOC) Perform radio check with aircrew during initial check-in or
   when radio status is in question.
106                                             AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011


  A10.4.5. (Added-AFSOC) Ensure the inter-site communications system properly operates
  at all positions/stations. Sites that have an FAA line verify that the FAA phone is operational
  by listening for a dial tone and contacting the local FAA center.
  A10.4.6. (Added-AFSOC) Monitor aircraft communications. Sites DO NOT HAVE AIR
  TRAFFIC CONTROL AUTHORITY. DO NOT issue, change, or cancel any Area Control
  Center clearances. Sites may relay information between Area Control Center and aircrews,
  on request. When communicating with aircrews, ESSs will identify the site by the assigned
  name and the term Electronic Scoring Site.
  A10.4.7. (Added-AFSOC) Verify aircraft call signs for wing identification using the static
  call sign listing provided by command post or base operations. Verify unlisted call signs
  with the aircrew.
      A10.4.7.1. (Added-AFSOC) Immediately advise aircrews of the altitude and
      approximate position of all other aircraft on the range. Advise them of route closures,
      severe weather advisories, and loss of capability by activity with an estimated time of
      return to operational status.
      A10.4.7.2. (Added-AFSOC) If more than one aircraft is scheduled at the same time
      through an ESS, using the same IP and assigned flight level, immediately advise both
      aircrews and request they contact the Area Control Center immediately.
  A10.4.8. (Added-AFSOC) Sites should obtain run information prior to mission start. Relay
  applicable run information to the EC crew. If aircraft reach IP and no run information has
  been provided, request only data necessary to support the run initially. Example: Electronic
  Countermeasures (ECM) request.
      A10.4.8.1. (Added-AFSOC) Confirm run information with all threat operators prior to
      the mission. Inform threat operators of any changes as soon as possible after notification.
      A10.4.8.2. (Added-AFSOC) Reconfirm run information with the aircrew only when the
      data is in doubt; however, do not hesitate to obtain necessary information. Do not pass
      minor equipment difficulties to the aircrew.
  A10.4.9. (Added-AFSOC) Assist radar operators in acquiring the aircraft; request
  acquisition information from the aircrew, as needed.
      A10.4.9.1. (Added-AFSOC) Communicators may ask aircrews for Mode 3 IFF code
      settings to identify the correct aircraft, the site may ask aircraft to go "STANDBY" in
      Mode 1 only. After aircraft identification, tell the aircrew they may go to "OPERATE."
      THE FOLLOWING REQUESTS ARE STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:
         A10.4.9.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Change Mode 3 code settings.
         A10.4.9.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) Go to "STANDBY" in Mode 3.
         A10.4.9.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) Change the Mode 1 code setting.
      A10.4.9.2. (Added-AFSOC) Request aircraft position to acquire or reacquire the
      aircraft. Ask an aircrew for present position from the target or main site, as applicable.
  A10.4.10. (Added-AFSOC) Advise the aircrew of known hazards in the immediate vicinity
  or along the aircraft's track, such as other aircraft, weather, etc.
AFI13-212_AFSOCSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2011                                                       107


   A10.4.11. (Added-AFSOC) Transmit "Giant Zero" when requested by MUTES.
   A10.4.12. (Added-AFSOC) Pass "CEASE BUZZER" requests to threat operators.
   A10.4.13. (Added-AFSOC) Query aircrews for any weak or undetected signals.
A10.5. (Added-AFSOC) Operations. Operate equipment IAW technical orders, operator’s
manuals, ACCI 10-707, Electronic Attack Training and Emissions Control Procedures, and/or
this supplement, as required.
   A10.5.1. (Added-AFSOC) Perform necessary equipment calibration and pre-operational
   checks prior to each vulnerability period. Turn equipment on in sufficient time to allow
   stable operation prior to performing equipment checks. When time constraints prevent a
   thorough pre-ops check at shift changeover, do pre-ops checks between aircraft. Consider
   MUTES and Mini-MUTES signals RED if:
      A10.5.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) The scan pattern is incorrect.
      A10.5.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) The pulse width is incorrect.
      A10.5.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) The pulse repetition interval is incorrect.
      A10.5.1.4. (Added-AFSOC) ERP        (Effective   Radiated   Power)     is   below   T.O.
      specifications.
      A10.5.1.5. (Added-AFSOC) A signal cannot be tuned to its representative threat
      frequency.
      A10.5.1.6. (Added-AFSOC) A signal cannot be radiated due to frequency restrictions.
      (Consider these signals red for scenario loss purposes/considerations only, not for
      maintenance purposes.)
      A10.5.1.7. (Added-AFSOC) A signal does not operate for at least half of an
      engagement.
   A10.5.2. (Added-AFSOC) ECM Run Types. ACCI 10-707 provides general descriptions
   of different run types that correspond to MUTES/Mini-MUTES scenarios.
   A10.5.3. (Added-AFSOC) Scenarios. Aircrews generally request a specific scenario or
   scenario type. Select the Mini-MUTES scenario that complements requested MUTES
   scenario. Refer to the 98 OG webpage on the AF Portal to check RIIS/ITAS and EW
   scenario status.
