1. General Information.
     1.1. IPV bench stock consists of indirect, consumable material. The IPV Spot Buy Program
     may be used for urgent indirect requirements.
        1.1.1. Indirect low-cost bench stock material ($150 or less) with frequent demands and
        used by the 309 MXW personnel should be located on the shop floor close to the
        mechanic’s work area.
            1.1.1.1. Frequent demand is considered those items with a minimum of one bin
            replenishment per year. NOTE: Items in bench stock with no replenishment action
            in 16 months or more, will be considered a candidate for deletion.
     1.2. Only NSNs managed by Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) can be managed in IPV
     bench stock, or purchased as an indirect spot buy.
     1.3. All IPV material will be planned as indirect; if items are planned as indirect in one
     group, they need to be planned indirect for the entire 309 MXW. NOTE: Indirect material
     is low cost, frequent demand. Verify Depot Maintenance Material Support System (G005M)
     for material classification and associated planner resource control center (RCC). If
     production planners can’t reach a consensus on the material classification (indirect or direct
     materiel), contact the 309 MXW Production Support Office (309 MXW/OBWP) to moderate
     resolution.
        1.3.1. Select Queries option from the tool bar;
        1.3.2. Enter NSN;
        1.3.3. Under the Component Data it will show your name, production document number,
        units per assembly, replacement % and planners RCC;
        1.3.4. Under the CC column A= Direct, L= Indirect, B= Exchange.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The procedures included in this instruction apply to the maintenance planner,
     WSSC/EPSC chief, in conjunction with Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) technical
     advisor (TA), DSCR contracting officer representative (COR) and the 309 MXW/OBWP.
     Coordination and approval by the owning squadron commander or director is required to add
     or maintain bench stock details, where the unit price is over $150 per item.
3. Additions, Deletions, or Changes to IPV NSNs.
     3.1. Additions: When a NSN is identified to be added to bench stock under the IPV
     contract, the following process will be completed. NOTE: Any item with a unit price over
     $150 will require squadron commander or director coordination, prior to loading a bench
     stock detail.
        3.1.1. The maintenance planner is responsible for submitting a 309 MXW Form 203, IPV
        Bench Stock Add, Change and Delete Approval Form. The 309 MXW Form 203 requires
        maintenance planners, WSSC/shop service center (SSC) chief or the EPSC material chief
        coordination/signature. The maintenance planner will be required to validate the item to
        be added is an expendable/indirect asset, and is not maintained as direct material on any
        BOM. Direct material items cannot be added to bench stock. Items with unit price over
309MXWI23-109 3 APRIL 2012                                                                   3


     $150 require squadron commander/director concurrence and signature to justify keeping
     the asset in bench stock as indirect material. Completed 309 MXW Forms 203 will be
     filed and maintained in the work planning packet. The 309 MXW Form 203 must
     contain the following information:
         3.1.1.1. NSN;
         3.1.1.2. Part Number;
         3.1.1.3. Noun;
         3.1.1.4. Unit of Issue;
         3.1.1.5. Bench Stock Location (used on deletion or changes only);
         3.1.1.6. Authorized Quantity (AQ) (30-day usage quantity);
         3.1.1.7. Anticipated yearly demand quantity;
         3.1.1.8. Bin Number (if available);
         3.1.1.9. Unit Cost.
     3.1.2. The maintenance planner needs to ensure the bin AQ is correct and accurate to
     meet the needs of the maintenance shop. The AQ should be set for a 30-day supply of
     material based on replacement factor. This quantity should be verified by the
     maintenance planner quarterly, and when workarounds have occurred IAW AFMCI 21-
     130, Chapter 3, BOM.
     3.1.3. The WSSC/EPSC chief will certify, prior to submission, that there are no current
     locations established in a pseudo SSC. If assets are located in the pseudo SSC, the
     request will be denied until stock is depleted. The WSSC/EPSC chief will forward all
     add requests to the squadron commander/director for coordination if the unit price is over
     $150.
     3.1.4. Planners need to route the 309 MXW Form 203 to ensure the appropriate
     coordination/approval is completed. Forward to DLA/DSCR TA for processing, to
     ensure the item is added in a timely matter.
     3.1.5. Any errors found on the 309 MXW Form 203 will be returned to the planner for
     correction. When all the information is correct, the TA will forward the 309 MXW Form
     203 to the DLA IPV program office for processing.
  3.2. Deletions and AQ Changes. DLA/DSCR COR office provides a quarterly report of all
  recommended deletions and AQ changes (increases and decreases) to the 309 MXW/OBWP.
  Included in this list will be any item where the unit cost has increased since being added to
  the contract, and exceeds the cost thresholds listed in paragraph 3.1.3 The 309
  MXW/OBWP will forward the list to all 309 MXW EPSC planners via email through group
  workflow for review. Recommended deletions and AQ increases/decreases will be included
  for any bin without replenishment in the past 16 months. Each line of the report will be
  annotated either concur or non-concur as follows:
     3.2.1. If the planning office non-concurs with delete recommendations, or AQ
     adjustment on specific NSNs and bins, those items should be marked or highlighted on
     the report with ‘Retain’ and justification should be included for retention. NOTE: Out-
 4                                                             309MXWI23-109 3 APRIL 2012


        of-cycle changes and deletions can be submitted by the planner to the DLA/DSCR TA or
        COR at any time based on mission requirements.
        3.2.2. All completed reports (concur and non-concur) should be approved by the
        squadron commander/director, and returned to the 309 MXW/OBWP within 15 days of
        receipt. The 309 MXW/OBWP will forward the report to the COR for action.
4. Spot Buys.
     4.1. The IPV program authorizes spot buys to support urgent material requirements for IPV
     supported organizations.
        4.1.1. Schedule of Items (SOI) Spot Buys. SOI spot buys are initiated by the IPV
        contractor to support existing bench stock bins when DLA has out-of-stock situations,
        and cannot supply material from wholesale stocks. Typically these purchases are for the
        estimated quantity that will support maintenance needs until DLA wholesale procures
        new material. SOI spot buys can only be initiated for items normally stocked in IPV
        bins.
        4.1.2. Non-SOI Spot Buy. This type of spot buy is only for NSNs that are not stocked in
        IPV bench stock. Non-SOI spot buys are initiated by maintenance customers for indirect
        material requirements urgently needed to support production. Shop chiefs or designated
        representatives will input non-SOI spot buy request directly into the IPV contractor
        website. Once the quote is received, the shop chief has the option to accept or decline the
        purchase.
     4.2. The IPV contracting officer maintains the final approval for all spot buy purchases. If
     the contracting officer determines the quoted unit price is not fair and reasonable, they will
     reject the purchase and negotiate with the IPV contractor to obtain lower price. They will
     also return the rejection notice to the COR. The maintenance initiator will be contacted to
     validate the requirement. The cost of continued shortages will determine if this process is a
     suitable work around.
5. Task Order Labor.
     5.1. Requests that fall outside of the scope of the IPV contract, must be approved by the
     squadron commander/director with coordination from the 309 MXW Financial Management
     (FM) office. The contracting officer is the final approval.
        5.1.1. Send a completed task order labor request containing a thorough description of the
        work required, the estimated duration, and the name of the government work leader that
        will oversee the task.
        5.1.2. Upon final approval, 309 MXW/FM will forward the request to DLA/DSCR COR
        for processing.
