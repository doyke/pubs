                                          Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. This document provides airspace management instructions on creating and
maintaining airspace that allows the United States Air Force (USAF) to meet operational needs
for Military Readiness. This instruction provides guidance for compliance with all the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and
other environmental guidance to include the Air Force‘s Planning Requirements in the
Environmental Impact Analysis Process (PREIAP). Additionally, this document creates
AF/A3O‘s airspace review process as required by Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part
989.28.
1.2. Scope. This instruction applies to each Major Command (MAJCOM) and Direct Reporting
Units (DRUs) functioning as the USAF component of a unified command, the National Guard
Bureau (NGB), the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and subordinate units. DRUs are
units that report directly to Headquarters Air Force (HAF) without benefit of MAJCOM
assistance. DRUs may require airspace and range management on a case-by-case basis, but are
most often tenant units whose airspace actions are processed through host unit and MAJCOM
channels. If DRUs have airspace and range responsibilities, they will comply with all
requirements of a MAJCOM as outlined in this instruction.
   1.2.1. For the purposes of this AFI, NGB refers to the ANG component and shall be treated
   as a MAJCOM.
   1.2.2. Due to the distinctive structure of the NGB, some functions described in this AFI are
   delegated to the NGB IAW Title 32, CFR, Part 989.3 to serve as lead staff organization. In
   each case, close coordination with the HAF counterpart is required.
1.3. Special Activity Airspace. Military Airspace is generally established for National
Defense, National Security and National Welfare. Special Activity Airspace (SAA) is the term
often used to describe Military Airspace. For the purpose of this instruction, SAA is any
airspace with defined dimensions within the National Airspace System (NAS) wherein
limitations may be imposed upon aircraft operations, such as Restricted Areas, Prohibited Areas,
Military Operations Areas (MOA), Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA), and any
other designated airspace areas. SAA consists of two common types of airspace: Special Use
Airspace (SUA) and Airspace for Special Use (ASU).
   1.3.1. SUA is airspace of defined dimensions identified by an area on the surface of the earth
   wherein activities must be confined because of their nature and/or wherein limitations may
   be imposed upon aircraft operations that are not part of those activities. SUA includes the
   following types of charted airspace: Military Operations Areas, Restricted Areas, Warning
   Areas, Alert Areas, Prohibited Areas, and National Security Areas (NSA). Controlled Firing
   Areas (CFA) are uncharted. With the exception of CFA, SUA is depicted on aeronautical
   charts. Attachment 1 contains more specific SUA definitions. Additional information on
   SUA may be found in the following publications: Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations
   (CFR) Part 73, Special Use Airspace; Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Joint Order
   (JO) 7400.2, Procedures for Handling Airspace Matters; FAA JO 7400.8, Special Use
 6                                                               AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


     Airspace; FAA JO 7610.4, Special Operations; Flight Information Publications (FLIP):
     General Planning (Chapter 2), AP/1A, AP/2A, AP/3A, and AP/4A.
     1.3.2. ASU is used to collectively identify non-SUA assets. Establishing certain types of
     ASU may not require coordination with the FAA or require the completion of a Test/Training
     Space Needs Statement (T/TSNS). ASU includes the following types of airspace: Aerial
     Refueling (AR) Tracks/Anchors, ATCAA, Low Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) areas,
     Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR), Cruise Missile Routes, Orbit Areas, Local Flying
     Areas, Military Training Routes (MTR) (Instrument Routes [IR] and Visual Routes [VR]),
     and Slow Routes (SR). None are rulemaking actions and some (contained solely in military
     documents) do not require coordination with the FAA for establishment. Attachment 1
     contains more specific ASU definitions. Additional information on ASU may be found in the
     FAA JO 7610.4, Special Operations, command or local military publications, and FLIP:
     General Planning, and AP/1B, North and South America – Military Training Routes.
1.4. Joint Use Airspace Policy (Military/Civilian). Military users should schedule only that
airspace required for mission accomplishment (to include weather back-up if conditions dictate)
and release the airspace to the FAA or host nation (HN) in a timely manner when not in use or
when no longer required.
1.5. Waivers and Exemptions. A waiver is a temporary exception that normally includes a
plan to alleviate the condition. The type of waiver determines the approval process, which may
include coordination with MAJCOM/A3, the FAA and Civil Engineers Planning Division
(AF/A7CI). Supersonic waiver information is located in Chapter 3 (Attachments 2 and 3 contain
formats for waiver requests); waivers to 14 CFR are addressed in Chapter 4. Exemptions are
permanent exceptions to a specific requirement and will be granted when the conditions cannot
be alleviated and increased risk is acceptable.
1.6. MAJCOM Supplements. MAJCOMs may develop their own supplemental procedures to
this instruction; however, they must ensure supplemented procedures are not less restrictive than
those contained in the basic instruction. If supplemented, MAJCOMs must send a copy to Air
Force Bases, Ranges and Airspace Division (AF/A3O-BA) for review and coordination prior to
publication. NOTE: Unit level supplements are also authorized with MAJCOM approval.

Airspace Directorate (AF/A3O-B) is designated as the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for
ranges and airspace. The Bases, Ranges and Airspace Division (AF/A3O-BA) is the focal point
for USAF airspace and range policy and management.
2.4. Director of Operations (AF/A3O). IAW HAFMD 1-54, the AF/A3O is responsible for
matters pertaining to ranges and airspace. The AF/A3O also serves as the co-chair for the
Strategic Basing-Executive Steering Group (SB-ESG) on airspace matters.
2.5. SB-ESG. The SB-ESG uses the Air Force Strategic Basing Process (SBP) to provide
guidance to ensure a deliberate, repeatable, defendable, standardized and transparent basing
process is applied using criteria-based analysis and sound military judgment. This allows linking
of mission and Combatant Commander‘s requirements to installation attributes to identify
locations best suited to support any given mission. Any creation or modification to existing
airspace is an attribute to the installation to support the mission and therefore, will be adjudicated
by the SB-ESG. NOTE: The Strategic Airspace Action Process (SAAP) as described in Chapter
3 of this AFI is designed to complement the SBP.
   2.5.1. SAAP uses the same format and membership of the SB-ESG as described in AFI 10-
   503, Strategic Basing, except the AF/A3O, Director of Operations, is added as a second vice-
   chair.
   2.5.2. Subordinate to the SB-ESG is the O-6 level Airspace Request Review Panel (ARRP)
   which reviews airspace action requirements and reasonable alternatives to apply a DoD-Wide
   review to ensure defendable requirements are met while minimizing or mitigating adverse
   impacts to the NAS and the environment. The ARRP provides a forum for the proponent
   MAJCOM to present airspace concepts, prior to the A3O adjudication, and airspace
   proposals prior to the SB-ESG briefing to the SecAF.
2.6. AF/A3O-B Responsibilities. AF/A3O-B shall:
   2.6.1. Develop policy and establish guidance, oversight and advocate resource and solutions
   to encroachment issues for USAF ranges and airspace, AF Aviation Operations Energy, Next

2.12. Airspace/Range Councils (ARC). (US Air Forces in Europe N/A). The USAF and NGB
co-sponsor and co-chair regional and national ARC meetings to ensure that all USAF offices
involved in airspace and range operations have a common understanding of objectives and key
issues. Because today‘s actions are closely scrutinized by numerous federal and state agencies as
well as public and private organizations and special interest groups, the USAF must be prepared
to address concerns raised at the local, regional, national and international level during the
development of any range or airspace action. To better address these challenges and ensure
continued access to test and training space, the USAF has established preliminary review
processes and a coordination forum in the form of ARCs.
   2.12.1. The use, creation, modification, or transfer of military airspace and ranges has the
   potential to become controversial. The councils provide for a thorough review of airspace
   and range issues by interdisciplinary teams at all management levels. The council meetings
   are open to all military services, land management agencies, and other interested or
   concerned parties by invitation only. ARCs shall:

       AFREPs, or other agencies as appropriate and approved by the regional co-chairs.
       2.12.1.3. Open action items from the ARCs will be reviewed quarterly by the regional
       and national co-chairs. AF/A3O-BA is responsible for coordinating the ARCs.
       NGB/A3A is responsible for maintaining the status of all open action items. The national
       co-chairs are the approval authority to close action items.
   2.12.2. Regional ARCs. Regional ARCs are comprised of all units within regionally divided
   areas (figure 2.1) and are designed to improve communication, coordination and resolution of
   airspace issues. The council‘s co-chairs include one HAF senior active duty officer or
   Department of the Air Force (DAF) civilian and one senior ANG officer. A senior officer
   (O-6 or civilian equivalent and above) responsible for airspace and range management
   oversight at the unit, MAJCOM, and/or National Guard State Headquarters level are
   preferred co-chairs. Co-chairs may be elected by the council, or appointed by AF/A3O-B or
   the Deputy Director of the Air National Guard. Meetings occur annually and include a DoD
   Session and a Management Session. Units with minimal range or airspace management
   responsibility may, at wing commander discretion, elect not to participate in the councils.
AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                      15

     national objectives.
     2.12.3.2. Attendance is limited to the co-chairs, MAJCOM representatives, AFREPs and
     other MILREPs, and senior ANG representatives from each state in the region. The
     strategic interests of individual units will be represented by their MAJCOM and/or their
     ANG state representative. Attendance by units with specific issues requiring Executive
     ARC visibility is approved by the MAJCOM and co-chair. Non-DoD participants may
     be invited at the discretion of the co-chairs. Co-chairs are responsible for inviting
     representatives from other military agencies.
  2.12.4. The National Airspace and Ranges Executive Council convenes annually to provide
  a forum for senior USAF leaders to review on-going, pending and proposed range and
  airspace actions from a national perspective and provide feedback to regional councils,
  MAJCOM, and HAF. The NAREC meeting also serves as a forum for senior USAF leaders
  to focus on the national strategic vision for airspace and ranges and keep members informed
  of national-level events and trends affecting airspace and range actions. NAREC
  membership includes the chair of each regional council and the senior officers charged with
  airspace and range responsibilities from the MAJCOM and HAF. The NAREC is co-chaired
  by AF/A3O (or designated representative) and an ANG general officer. All AFREPs and
  MAJCOM airspace and range managers and Range/Airspace Division Chiefs should attend
  this meeting. Senior representatives from other government agencies and services may be
  invited by the regional co-chair and approved by the national co-chairs as required.

  and Regional ARCs will be distributed to all participants except those of the DoD only
  sessions which will be limited distribution.

                          PROCESSING AIRSPACE ACTIONS

3.1. Strategic Airspace Action Process (SAAP). Strategic Airspace Action Process The
SAAP is the process through which the AF/A3O reviews airspace actions IAW Title 32, CFR
Part 989.28. In order to build public awareness and ensure the accuracy of information
disseminated, the USAF encourages public access to the unprecedented amount of information
on airspace actions. Airspace actions often occur across multiple boundaries and coordination
must be accomplished with Congressional offices, the FAA, state executive and legislative
bodies, national interests, MAJCOMs and TAGs. There could be competing requirements from
different MAJCOMs that have unintended adverse impacts or significant resistance from
external agencies. Applying a DoD-Wide, strategic approach to the development of
comprehensive airspace actions can improve overall understanding of the intent and mission
requirements, reducing overall completion time. As described in paragraph 2.12, the ARC can
be a venue for coordinating actions between MAJCOMs, soliciting TAG involvement, and
performing a DoD-Wide review of airspace proposals. The SAAP is conducted in four phases:
Concept Phase, in which the Test/Training Space Needs Statement (T/TSNS) is proposed and
developed; Proposal Phase, in which the proposal (normally expressed as chapters 1 and 2 of a
draft Description of Proposed Action and Alternatives (DOPAA) as described in Planning
Requirements in the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (PREIAP)) is developed and
internal scoping activity managed by the proponent and the EPF; Engagement Planning Phase,
where the engagement plan is prepared; and the Decision Phase, which is directed under the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 as promulgated in Title 32, CFR, Part 989.

  3.1.1. Concept Phase. Airspace actions in this phase of development should be referred to as
  ―concepts‖, since there is no assurance that the initiative will be developed into a formal
  action. At a minimum, concepts should include volume, proximity, time and attributes.
  General public release should not occur during this phase, as concepts may change frequently
  and proliferation of misinformation can be damaging to the overall effort. During informal
  liaison with stakeholders, use of the term ―concept‖ ensures all parties understand the
  initiative is flexible in nature and will not be confused with a formal aeronautical proposal.
     3.1.1.1. Test/Training Space is defined as air, land or sea that is used to conduct military
     test, training or operational activities. Using a T/TSNS, proponents describe the
     operational requirements, initial concept, potential alternatives, and a review of other
     known potential interests. Actions to establish or modify SAA, as defined in paragraph
     1.3., except those purely administrative in nature or not approved and published by the
     FAA, will be developed by the unit, validated by the MAJCOM, evaluated by HAF
     (including the AFREPs) and adjudicated by AF/A3O (CONUS, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto
     Rico and Alaska only). Coordination should include the MAJCOM Civil Engineer office
     responsible for Environment Analysis, Legal, and PA offices. Modifications to SAA that
     do not alter the physical dimensions, altitudes, times of use, or reverse the direction of an
     MTR (e.g., changing the designation of the controlling or using agency, correction of
     typographical errors in the published description, Letter of Agreement (LOA) changes,
     etc.) will be reviewed by the unit and MAJCOM, but does not require a T/TSNS.
     3.1.1.2. Development of the T/TSNS will vary depending upon the level of initiation and
     scope of the need. AFCEE/TDX can support development of the T/TSNS as NEPA
     subject matter expertise as part of an interdisciplinary PREIAP team. Units may initiate
     their own T/TSNS for requirements or MAJCOM-directed unit mission change. For
     example, an F-16 unit may be directed to change their mission from air defense to general
     purpose, or a fighter unit may be equipped with new munitions with capabilities and
     tactics requiring different operating space characteristics. A MAJCOM may have the
     need to implement significant changes in training for a new weapon system. New and
     ongoing T/TSNSs will be addressed at all affected ARCs. Unit or MAJCOM procedures
     apply as follows:
         3.1.1.2.1. Unit T/TSNS is initially approved by the wing commander (or equivalent).
         3.1.1.2.2. MAJCOM T/TSNSs are initiated by a MAJCOM and would be appropriate
         when a new weapons system requires a significant change in operating space
         configuration.
     3.1.1.3. The T/TSNS shall provide clarity, depth and scope sufficient to enable a
     reasonable review and assessment. Development of the T/TSNS should be an "in-house"
     effort. See Attachment 6 for an example of a T/TSNS. The general format for a T/TSNS
     is as follows:
         3.1.1.3.1. Title. The title of the T/TSNS shall consist of a concise description of the
         concept and be given a unique alphanumeric designation utilizing the following
         format: MAJCOM, 2-digit year, 3-digit sequence number (assigned by MAJCOM),
         unit or proponent designator, and the title of the initiative (e.g., ACC-12-001: Sample
         AFB, Operating Airspace for F-45 Bed down). Include the T/TSNS proponent‘s
         name and phone number on the title page.
AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                      19


        3.1.1.3.2. Operational Requirement/Justification. Describe specific requirement(s)
        driving the action. Explain the unit‘s mission, operational requirements not currently
        being met, other units affected, weapon system characteristics, and coordination
        accomplished to date.
        3.1.1.3.3. Concept. Briefly describe the concept. Include maps illustrating current
        and future airspace/range configuration to include altitudes, legend, and a scale. The
        concept should detail who wants to do what, where, and why, including objectives of
        the action. Include boundary dimensions and description (**nautical miles (NM) x
        **NM), the volume (e.g. 10,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) to flight level (FL) 600),
        proximity to the installation, time (frequency and periods of use e.g. 0800-2200
        Monday-Friday) and attributes (e.g., use of chaff and flares, supersonic, threats,
        targets, frequency spectrum, mountainous terrain, etc.). This concept should not be
        so detailed as to prematurely eliminate potentially reasonable alternatives.
        3.1.1.3.4. Alternatives. Briefly list the alternatives to the concept including a ―No
        Action‖ alternative. Reasonable alternatives include those that are practical or
        feasible from a common sense, technical, and economic standpoint. In developing
        alternatives, consider alternatives that may be procedural or non-material in nature
        (e.g., renegotiation of LOAs with sister services or the FAA or implementation of
        seasonally-based deconfliction procedures during peak use periods). ―No Action‖
        means the continuation of present management activities without implementing the
        concept. Impacts may include quantifiable degradation to training, inability to meet
        mission objectives or higher headquarters direction, inefficiencies, costs, etc. If
        applicable, include a section that addresses ―Actions Considered but Not Carried
        Forward‖ with the rationale as to why these options do not meet requirements.
        3.1.1.3.5. Air Traffic Control Coordination. Coordinate with DoD/FAA ATC
        facilities prior to forwarding the T/TSNS. Informal discussions with ATC facilities
        may provide guidance on how the T/TSNS will impact air traffic flow for that
        affected area. List any concerns voiced by the ATC facilities in this section.
        3.1.1.3.6. Other Interest Potential. T/TSNS actions have the potential to raise
        controversial issues, reaching to the national level, very early in the planning process.
        Therefore, it is critical that USAF planning and review processes are as thorough as
        possible, with involvement of concerned parties, public and private, early in the
        decision phase. Public involvement and notification of airspace actions and proposals
        is not only a legal requirement, but an effective way to increase the probability of
        success. USAF proponents should develop a plan to involve groups with competing
        interests early in the process. Use all available resources (e.g. subject matter
        expertise, previous environmental actions, etc.) to identify potential competing
        interests from stakeholders that may be impacted by this action. Briefly state in bullet
        format whether the concept or any of the alternatives may impact recreational areas
        (e.g. federal, state, and local parks); Native American reservations, lands, or areas of
        special interest; grazing or farming; endangered species; wildlife refuges;
        consultation with other state/federal agencies; archaeological sites; hunting and
        fishing areas; population centers, communities, previously identified or potential
        noise sensitive areas; ongoing litigation; other training space actions; and regional
        actions by other MAJCOMs or military departments. Identify outside agencies that
20                                                              AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


        have requested or would support the concept (federal, state, local, and/or stakeholder
        groups) and if any coordination has been completed to date.
     3.1.1.4. Airspace proposals are closely scrutinized by the public; as such, it is imperative
     that a T/TSNS is based upon valid and defendable operational/training requirements. The
     MAJCOM/A3 will evaluate each T/TSNS to validate the requirements. To ensure
     proponents remain actively involved in the development of proposals and alternatives, it
     is recommended that units do not use contractors for this purpose. If a T/TSNS affects
     more than one MAJCOM, then one MAJCOM will be designated the proponent
     MAJCOM. Close coordination may be required at unit, base and MAJCOM level to
     ensure a successful, coordinated action. Each action has its own characteristics and roles,
     and must be clearly defined in the original scoping. As an example, if ―MAJCOM A‖
     requires additional airspace to operate from ―MAJCOM B‘s‖ installation, normally
     MAJCOM A will be the proponent working closely with MAJCOM B‘s unit and base
     organizations and coordination with MAJCOM B‘s A3 directorate.
     3.1.1.5. Upon completion of the MAJCOM validation, the T/TSNS will be forwarded to
     A3O-BA to begin the A3O‘s adjudication. This adjudication process has three steps; a
     review by the other MAJCOMs, TAGs, Regional ARC and AFREPs; followed by a
     review by the ARRP; and lastly a final adjudication by the A3O. This adjudication will
     primarily consider the validity and defendability of the requirements. However, airspace
     design, analysis of alternatives, practicality and future force structure, etc., will be
     considered. This final adjudication allows the concept to proceed to the Proposal Phase.
        3.1.1.5.1. The T/TSNS will be sent to the other appropriate MAJCOMs, TAGs and
        Regional ARC for their coordination. AFREPs will review the T/TSNS with other
        service area MILREPs to determine impacts, if any, to other service airspace actions.
        Results will be referred to the ARRP.
        3.1.1.5.2. The ARRP chaired by the AF/A3O-B and its members will include, at a
        minimum, Operations Force Management Division (AF/A3O-A), Planning Division
        Office of the Air Force Civil Engineer (AF/A7CI), the AF NEPA Center
        (AFCEE/TDX), Strategic Basing office, Directorate of Programs (AF/A8PB), NGB
        Strategy and Forces Structure Division (NGB/A8X), the AF General Counsel
        Environment and Installations Law office (SAF/GCN), Deputy Assistant Secretary of
        the Air Force for Installations (SAF/IEI), Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force
        for Energy, Environment, Safety and Occupational Health (SAF/IEE), Air Force
        Public Affairs Current Operations (SAF/PAO), and Air Force International Affairs
        (SAF/IA) (if applicable).
        3.1.1.5.3. After a successful review by the MAJCOMs, TAGs, Regional ARC,
        AFREPs and ARRP, the T/TSNS will be forwarded to the AF/A3O for final
        adjudication.
     3.1.1.6. Initial HAF review shall be completed within 60 calendar days of AF/A3O-BA
     receipt. Final T/TSNS adjudication from AF/A3O may exceed the 60 calendar days, in
     which case the MAJCOM will be notified by AF/A3O-BA. HAF will identify issues
     during the initial review. If either the validating MAJCOM or HAF determine the
     T/TSNS to be insufficiently supported by defendable requirements, it will be returned to
     the originator with specific issues identified for further examination.
AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                      21


     3.1.1.7. The final step in the concept phase is MAJCOM completion of the DoD-Wide
     Look, completed by the MAJCOM upon final adjudication by the AF/A3O. This step
     normally runs concurrent with the development of the concept and will help determine
     the preferred alternative and identify additional reasonable alternatives for consideration
     during the proposal phase. Early in the concept phase, units/MAJCOMs are encouraged
     to begin informal discussions with interagency and aviation professional groups. During
     this step, the concept is reviewed by the MAJCOM to determine if there are alternative
     solutions to satisfy the requirements of the proposal within the MAJCOM or across the
     AF.     AF/A3O-BA will assist as requested during these discussions. These informal
     discussions can continue through the development of the proposal.
  3.1.2. Proposal Phase. With final adjudication from AF/A3O, the proposed action described
  on the T/TSNS moves into the Proposal Phase to initiate PREIAP and produce and stabilize
  the Draft DOPAA. The Draft DOPAA covers the same subject matter as the T/TSNS;
  however, it expands upon the T/TSNS basic elements and is expected to address all items of
  the proposal in the level of detail required to begin the environmental phase.
     3.1.2.1. The Unit or MAJCOM acting as the proponent completes AF Form 813 per 32
     CFR 989 to initiate the PREIAP with the Environmental Planning Function (EPF)
     (installation and/or AF NEPA Center) to produce the Draft DOPAA and other data. This
     satisfies CEQ 1501.2 which states that agencies should apply NEPA early in the process.
     Refer to the PREIAP Guidance for further information. As part of the PREIAP, the
     proponent MAJCOM/A3 will evaluate and approve each Draft DOPAA to ensure it is in
     accordance with established, current requirements. In a case where multiple MAJCOMs
     are involved in an airspace action, additional MAJCOMs (non-proponent) will also
     coordinate on the DOPAA.
     3.1.2.2. Restricted Area proposals requesting designation from the surface will indicate
     that the proponent owns, leases, or by agreement controls the underlying surface. Failure
     to do so prior to submission of the proposal may delay processing.
     3.1.2.3. After completing PREIAP, the proponent MAJCOM submits their proposal to
     the SB-ESG through AF/A3O-BA. AF/A3O-BA will review the proposal and submit the
     proposal to the ARRP for review and SB-ESG for its adjudication.
     3.1.2.4. The weekly SB-ESG is a high-level body which guides the USAF basing
     process. This group will review the proposal and will adjudicate and refer the proposal to
     the SecAF. The proposal is then briefed to the SecAF as part of the monthly Basing
     Update before it moves forward to governmental and public engagement in the decision
     phase as required IAW 32 CFR Part 989, Environmental Impact Analysis Process.
     Details on the SB-ESG can be found in AFI 10-503, Strategic Basing.
  3.1.3. Engagement Planning Phase. Units should begin the development of the engagement
  plan as early as possible to ensure that a final plan is ready for execution shortly after the
  proposal is briefed to the SecAF. After the SecAF is briefed, first notification of the concept
  should be made to the affected area‘s Congressional delegation(s), which will be coordinated
  through AF/A3O-BA to SAF/LL channels (NGB/LL for NGB airspace issues) (CONUS,
  Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico and Alaska only). Notification to affected TAGs will be made
  following congressional notification. These notifications should take place no later than one
  day prior to public notification. In coordination with Public Affairs, public engagement
 22                                                              AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


   should take place in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 as
   promulgated in Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 989. Attachment 8 provides a
   matrix of required and suggested communication activities based on the type of NEPA action
   being accomplished.
   3.1.4. Decision Phase. Airspace and range actions are subject to environmental analysis in
   order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 as promulgated in Title
   32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 989. MAJCOMs develop concepts (including the
   Aeronautical Proposal) that concern airspace under FAA jurisdiction according to the
   procedures outlined in FAA JO 7400.2 and FAA JO 7610.4 (CONUS, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto
   Rico and Alaska only). Overseas units will coordinate with host nation and/or liaison
   officers regarding proposed airspace actions. Once the concept is recommended by the
   SecAF IAW paragraph 3.1.2, MAJCOMs submit USAF airspace actions (both environmental
   analysis and aeronautical proposals) to the FAA through the AFREP.
       3.1.4.1. The Decision Phase is concluded when a decision is reached on the proposed
       airspace action, and the decision is properly coordinated, documented and announced in
       accordance with the Environmental Impact Analysis Process requirements in 32 CFR
       989.
       3.1.4.2. Airspace proposals for temporary exercise airspace, provisions for short-term
       special missions outside of established airspace, or similar actions should be reviewed by
       the MAJCOM with an information copy routed to the AFREP and AF/A3O-BA.
3.2. Processing a National Security Area (NSA) Request. NSA proposals should clearly state
the rationale for the NSA requirement and the proposed boundaries of the NSA (include a map).
All NSA proposals should be coordinated through the installation airspace and ATC offices.
Unit airspace management offices shall coordinate with respective ATC and security forces
offices. If local ATC service is not provided by the requesting unit or host installation,
coordinate the initiative with the ATC facility providing this service before forwarding to the
wing/installation commander for approval.
   3.2.1. Following wing/installation commander approval, all NSA proposals will be
   forwarded to the MAJCOM airspace management office for coordination, with an
   information copy to the AFREP. AFREPs will not take action on NSA proposals until
   formal coordination has been requested by AF/A3O-BA.
   3.2.2. Once approved by the MAJCOM, forward the NSA proposal to AF/A3O-BA.
   3.2.3. AF/A3O-BA will coordinate the proposal with SAF/GCN and other HAF agencies as
   appropriate. Once approved, AF/A3O-BA will forward the proposal to the AFREP for
   coordination with the FAA.
   3.2.4. The USAF recognizes the potential vulnerability of certain facilities to threats from
   the air. However, concerns about the affect of flight-restricted airspace on the NAS have
   traditionally outweighed the potential security benefits provided by such a designation.
   Based upon historic FAA responses to restricted flight over USAF installations/activities,
   units should not plan to permanently establish flight avoidance areas over
   installations/activities to satisfy local security requirements. Should a specific and credible
   threat to an installation be identified, a TFR is the preferred alternative.
AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                      23


3.3. Letters of Agreement (LOA). Develop actions that concern airspace under FAA
jurisdiction according to the procedures outlined in FAA JOs 7400.2 and 7610.4. Additional
information on creating LOAs with the FAA can be found in FAA JO 7210.3, Facility Operation
and Administration and AFI 13-204 Volume 3.
3.4. Supersonic Operations (CONUS, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico and Alaska only).
   3.4.1. When operationally necessary, conduct planned supersonic operations IAW current,
   approved EIAP and only under the following conditions:
      3.4.1.1. Over open water areas, above 10,000 feet MSL and more than 15 NM from any
      land area.
      3.4.1.2. Over land areas, above 30,000 feet MSL.
      3.4.1.3. Avoid areas of population concentration and ―Avoidance Locations,‖ as well as
      HAF specified critical areas listed in FLIP AP/1B.
   3.4.2. If units require supersonic flight operations outside the parameters above, submit a
   waiver request through the MAJCOM/A3 (include coordination with the MAJCOM and unit
   level EIAP program managers). Waiver requests shall include the appropriate level of
   environmental analysis and an airspace analysis documenting the requirement for existing
   and projected airspace utilization, availability, and deficiencies (see Attachment 2). These
   materials must accompany the waiver request to AF/A3O-BA for HAF review, coordination
   (AF/A7CI at a minimum) and approval. Waivers will be valid for a period not to exceed
   three years.
      3.4.2.1. Submit requests for supersonic tests/exercises of short duration (30 days or less)
      through MAJCOM/A3 channels to AF/A3O-BA for approval (with AF/A7CI
      concurrence) at least 60 days prior to mission requirement date. Accompany waiver
      requests with the appropriate level of environmental analysis (Environmental
      Assessment, unsigned Finding of No Significant Impact, or draft Environmental Impact
      Statement).
      3.4.2.2. For recurring tests/exercises or tests/exercises of duration greater than 30 days,
      submit requests IAW paragraph 3.4.2. not later than 60 days prior to the mission start
      date.
   3.4.3. The MAJCOM/A3, in coordination with the MAJCOM environmental office, will
   review and approve supersonic flying waivers for renewal every 3 years. The review will be
   conducted to ensure operations, affected environments, and resulting impacts are consistent
   with the environmentally assessed and approved actions. Evaluate all adopted mitigation
   measures and commitments made in initially approving the supersonic flying operations for
   compliance. Detail changes to land use underneath the area of supersonic flight that have
   occurred since the original approval and include any updated environmental analysis.
   MAJCOM airspace management offices, environmental office, and other offices, as
   necessary, shall develop and maintain a management system for ensuring compliance and
   periodic monitoring.
      3.4.3.1. Promptly advise AF/A3O-BA of any environmental or operational condition
      warranting reconsideration of the decision approving supersonic flight operations (e.g., a
      different weapon system, environmental conditions, or a change in tactics).
 24                                                               AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


       3.4.3.2. If the waiver renewal is not completed prior to the 3 year expiration date, the
       controlling MAJCOM/A3 (with environmental planning function coordination) is
       authorized to approve temporary continuation of existing supersonic operations below
       30,000 feet MSL until the waiver is renewed. All requirements and restrictions imposed
       by the original approval remain in effect.
   3.4.4. MAJCOM airspace management offices shall notify AF/A3O-BA of MAJCOM/A3
   waiver renewals or temporary continuation of existing supersonic operations within 30 days
   and maintain supporting documents for a minimum of 10 years.
   3.4.5. Sonic Boom Events. The characteristics of sonic booms are such that damage to
   property may result. The USAF adjudicates sonic boom claims caused by Air Force, AFRC,
   and ANG aircraft. The Air Force staff judge advocate nearest the incident location normally
   investigates claims or complaints. Commanders of units operating aircraft capable of
   supersonic flight or units that manage airspace used by such aircraft will establish internal
   methods to document supersonic flight activities over land or within 15 NM from any land
   area. The remarks section in the Aircrew Resource Management System may be used for
   this purpose. Training or scheduling/utilization tools are also acceptable. Minimum
   information to be retained includes callsign, type aircraft, unit, location of supersonic event,
   and route of flight. This data is not required for supersonic activity that is part of combat or
   combat support missions.
       3.4.5.1. Acknowledgment of unauthorized supersonic activity will be made to the
       originating or scheduling activity of the airspace. Identification of involved DoD aircraft
       permits the investigating judge advocate to confirm USAF involvement and obtain
       aircraft and flight data that are useful for computing the approximate magnitude of sonic
       booms.
       3.4.5.2. If flight data is classified, pilots should provide the minimum information
       needed to identify the flight and home base. Prompt acknowledgment of supersonic
       activity enables the judge advocate to conduct an immediate investigation, helps to
       promptly resolve pending claims, and enables PA officials to promptly respond to
       community and news media inquiries.
3.5. SUA Review Teams. The FAA SUA Review Program provides for a continuing review of
all airspace allocations IAW FAA JO 7400.2. To supplement routine airspace programs and the
annual review afforded by Restricted Area/Military Operations Area utilization reports, the FAA
may use SUA review teams as required to examine selected areas. These teams coordinate their
visits to USAF units with the MAJCOM through the AFREP.
   3.5.1. SUA review teams review selected areas, determine required actions, and recommend
   a plan for efficient and safe use of airspace. They examine the current and planned use of
   SUA to minimize conflict with other airspace users. Based on each user‘s requirements and
   actual use of airspace, they evaluate the need to retain, change, revoke, or establish SUA.
   Consideration should be given to returning associated ATCAAs when returning MOAs to the
   NAS.
   3.5.2. MAJCOMs should be prepared to consolidate and provide the teams detailed
   documentation regarding scheduling, utilization times, altitudes, geographical areas used,
   type of air activities conducted, and future use plans (for the ANG, units will provide this
AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                        25


   documentation through their respective Adjutant General (TAG)). Address national security
   requirements at an unclassified level unless team member security clearance authorizations
   are appropriately verified prior to the team visit. Military participation will be on a case-by-
   case basis.
   3.5.3. Based upon the team's recommendations, the FAA, with military concurrence, may
   initiate procedural changes or airspace modifications.
3.6. Airspace Disposition Process. Responsible stewardship of airspace resources involves
identifying parcels of airspace no longer required by the USAF. However, such airspace may
meet the requirements of another user. Take the following steps to return unneeded airspace to
the NAS:
   3.6.1. Originating activity notifies the MAJCOM of intention to return airspace.
   3.6.2. MAJCOMs solicit input from other units within the MAJCOM to determine if there
   are other USAF units with a need for the airspace. If a requirement is identified, the
   MAJCOM will notify the AFREP of their intention to reassign the airspace. AFREPs will
   assist with the FAA process.
NOTE: Changes in use of airspace, other than administrative in nature, require environmental
consideration per the EIAP.
   3.6.3. If no requirement is identified within the MAJCOM, the MAJCOM will notify
   AF/A3O-BA, who will solicit input from other MAJCOMs.
   3.6.4. If AF/A3O-BA determines there is no USAF requirement, AF/A3O-BA will notify the
   Airspace Subgroup of the PBFA to determine if there is any other DoD requirement. If
   another Service has a need for the airspace, that Service assumes the lead for transferring the
   airspace. If there is no requirement, AF/A3O-BA will initiate action through FAA/AJR-01 to
   return the airspace to the NAS. FAA/AJR-01 will maintain a listing of airspace returned to
   the NAS.
 26                                                              AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


                                           Chapter 4

                       AIRSPACE PLANNING AND OPERATION

4.1. Importance of Effective Community Relations. Effective community relations dictate
mutual respect for, and recognition of, factors affecting or affected by USAF operations.
Properly addressing community and stakeholder concerns or interest about current or proposed
USAF operations can be greatly assisted through effective community relations. Additionally,
for new proposed airspace actions, community involvement activities are a requirement of the
Environmental Impact Analysis Process, as described in 32 CFR 989. Coordinate all community
relations issues with the wing/installation or MAJCOM PA office, and the Environmental
Planning Function office for new proposed airspace actions.
   4.1.1. Commanders should highlight in their PA programs the need for operational readiness
   and actions that contribute to the state of readiness. PA programs should fully explain all
   measures taken by the USAF to avoid or mitigate disturbances to civilian communities,
   especially those communities underlying or near military airspace. Present this information
   not only to those communities in the immediate vicinity of the facility, but when applicable,
   to other stakeholders such as the FAA, NPS, BLM, USFS, USFWS, BIA, state aviation
   officials, and other bodies/groups focused on national aviation issues. Active participation in
   the ARCs is an essential part of an outreach program.
   4.1.2. The USAF has a responsibility to protect the public, to the maximum extent
   practicable, from the hazards and effects associated with flight operations.
       4.1.2.1. Units must be sensitive to USAF environmental and safety responsibilities and
       to the concerns of affected communities and aviation groups. Evaluation of flight
       activities will be an agenda item for the airspace manager at the wing AOB at least
       annually. AOB minutes serve as documentation of the annual evaluation.
       4.1.2.2. Review the effects of mission changes. Changes to air operations are likely to
       cause public concern or comment regarding environmental impacts and require
       environmental analysis as prescribed in Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 989.
   4.1.3. It is important for the USAF to recognize and communicate to the public the
   difference between an ―operational impact‖ and a ―readiness impact.‖ Although a particular
   public concern may have an impact on operations (routes, altitudes, turn points, etc.), the
   potential change to our operations may not impact our readiness. Conversely, a proposed
   restriction that would prohibit a bomber wing from dropping training ordnance could clearly
   affect the readiness of that unit. Recognizing the difference between these two concepts may
   create an opportunity for cooperation in negotiating or mitigating airspace issues.
   4.1.4. Readily available public information can be helpful in gaining support for USAF air
   operations. Units should:
       4.1.4.1. Establish a program to distribute information on military airspace and supersonic
       areas. Ensure coordination with the appropriate FAA facility (CONUS, Hawaii, Guam,
       Puerto Rico and Alaska only).
       4.1.4.2. Develop an explanatory letter outlining the purpose, routes, areas, altitudes,
       intensity, day, and time of use of the areas or routes and location of existing operating
AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                       27


       areas or routes in the vicinity. Use aids such as charts, photographs, and film footage for
       visual clarification. Send the letter and appropriate visual materials through PA for
       release to appropriate community news media. Send this information to each interested
       stakeholder.
       4.1.4.3. Provide PA offices with information to be used in news releases for new areas
       and routes or major modifications to existing ones. Provide additional information for
       follow-up news releases as required.
       4.1.4.4. Ensure community and news media inquiries on changes to operations areas or
       routes are answered promptly.
   4.1.5. Because of increased public and political sensitivities associated with military
   airspace, appropriate Congressional offices should be informed of significant emerging
   mission requirements at the earliest opportunity. This serves to promote better understanding
   of the USAF‘s flying mission and prepare Congressional offices to address public comments.
       4.1.5.1. Timely and accurate response to Congressional inquiries is paramount. HQ OI
       33-3, Correspondence Preparation, Control, and Tracking, Table 6.1, states that tasks
       from Members of Congress to SecAF/CSAF, have a suspense of 10 calendar days. There
       should be no expectation of an extension to the 10 day response requirement unless there
       are significant issues justifying additional time. AF/A3O-BA will be the A3/5 focal point
       for inquiries received at the HAF and will coordinate through the MAJCOM airspace or
       range management function for inputs/responses to inquiries (Congressional inquiries
       involving the ANG will be routed through NGB/LL). Avoid referring callers to other
       military departments or government agencies without first attempting to answer questions
       concerning aircraft noise through all available means.
NOTE: The intent of this paragraph is not to circumvent or supersede the MAJCOM or unit PA
office role in these issues. PA should be provided the opportunity to coordinate on responses to
all Congressional inquiries.
   4.1.6. State Ajutant Generals are important resources for MAJCOMs as an entry point to
   state executive and legislative branches. Informing state governmental organizations early in
   the airspace proposal process is important in garnering public support.
   4.1.7. Coordinate official visits to the FAA through FAA/AJR-01. Coordinate all official
   visits to FAA service area offices through the applicable AFREP. Inform the AFREP of all
   issues other than routine operational coordination between the USAF and applicable FAA
   offices. MAJCOMs or HAF must approve comments, commitments (LOAs, Memorandums
   of Understanding, etc.), and opinions regarding airspace or other aeronautical matters
   covered by this instruction prior to forwarding to outside agencies. This does not prevent
   routine coordination between operating elements of the USAF, the FAA, and host nation
   ATC agencies or officials.
4.2. Applicable Federal Aviation Requirements.
   4.2.1. Public Law 85-726, The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, created the FAA
   and charged the FAA Administrator with managing all national airspace under United States
   jurisdiction, including US Protectorates and designated Flight Information Regions. Because
   DoD airspace requirements often compete with those of commercial and general aviation and
 28                                                             AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


   may impact freedom to transit certain airspace, DoD military services have a special interest
   in presenting credible requirements to the FAA and managing allocated airspace efficiently.
   4.2.2. Title 5 United States Code Sections 551–559, Administrative Procedure Act, requires
   public notice before the FAA can carry out certain airspace management actions, including
   military actions. The FAA notifies the public of an airspace proposal through a Notice of
   Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) published in the Federal Register, or by distributing a non-
   rulemaking circular that describes the proposal to known interested parties. Either of these
   methods sets forth the proposal and specifies a period of time in which the FAA will receive
   comments or suggestions. The FAA will publish its final decision, stating whether or not the
   proposal was modified as a result of the comments or suggestions received. If the FAA's
   final decision makes minor changes to the original proposal, a second NPRM or circular is
   not normally required. In all cases, the FAA makes the final decision on SUA proposals.
   4.2.3. Waivers to 14 CFR, Federal Aviation Regulations, are processed by forwarding four
   copies of FAA Form 7711-2, Application for Certificate of Waiver or Authorization,
   (available from FAA Service Area Offices) through military command channels to
   Headquarters, Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) Director, Operations Policy &
   Standards, AFFSA/A3O. AFFSA/A3O sends the original and two copies to the FAA.
NOTE: Waivers for airshow issues (speed, minimum safe altitudes, parachute jumping, etc.)
should be submitted directly to the local Flight Standards District Office.
   4.2.4. 14 CFR Part 91.117 covers aircraft speed. Recognizing that some DoD aircraft
   performance requirements exceed 250 knots, the FAA issued an exemption to 14 CFR Part
   91.117. However, the exemption is not a blanket waiver. Conditions under which operations
   exceeding 250 knots are authorized below 10,000 feet MSL can be found in FAA JO 7610.4.
   4.2.5. 14 CFR Part 91.119 states minimum safe altitudes. Recognizing there is a requirement
   to train below these altitudes, the FAA issued an exemption to 14 CFR to permit Department
   of Defense to the extent necessary to conduct all-weather low-altitude route operations.
4.3. International, Foreign National Operations and Combat Airspace. USAF procedures
governing operations in international or foreign national airspace must recognize the right of a
foreign government to establish and enforce procedures for operations within its sovereign
airspace. AF/A3O-BA oversees international and foreign operations and coordinates with
MAJCOMs as applicable.
   4.3.1. Host nation laws, regulations, and procedures are detailed in AIP, ICAO Rules and
   Practices, or locally published directives. Non-conflicting USAF and DoD directives apply
   in foreign national airspace.
   4.3.2. A designated US military operational command may manage combat or contingency
   airspace during times of tension, contingencies, or war. AF/A3O-BA oversees combat
   airspace control and development of related policy and doctrine.
   4.3.3. ICAO documents specify standards and recommend practices for international flight
   operations and ATC. ICAO governs USAF flight operations in international and foreign
   national airspace by these standards and practices, as supplemented by each ICAO member
   nation‘s AIP, non-conflicting applications of USAF or DoD directives, and special LOAs for
AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                       29


   strategic, tactical readiness, or training operations. See FLIP and DoD Foreign Clearance
   Guide.
4.4. SUAS/RPA Certificate of Waiver and Authorization (COA). Unrestricted sUAS/RPA
operations in the NAS are limited to Prohibited, Restricted and Warning Areas. Operations
outside of Prohibited, Restricted or Warning Areas require an FAA COA to ensure sufficient
safety mitigations are in place to meet a ―See and Avoid‖ capability as required by Title 14 CFR
§91.113 (b). FAAJO 7610.4 describes the COA application process.
   4.4.1. Units requiring NAS access outside of Prohibited, Restricted or Warning Areas
   (including transit requirements to get to those areas) must consult with the respective lead
   MAJCOM before beginning the COA application and to request access to the FAA on-line
   application web site. While informal discussions with the FAA may be beneficial and lead to
   expedited COA processing, units will not formally contact the FAA directly. MAJCOMs
   must coordinate all sUAS/RPA COA requests through the lead MAJCOM. The USAF has
   designated lead MAJCOMs for sUAS/RPA COA submissions:
       4.4.1.1. ACC is the lead MAJCOM for all Group 4 and 5 RPA operations per AFPD 10-
       9, Lead Command Designation and Responsibilities for Weapon Systems. ACC/A3A is
       the primary POC for integration and COA issues. ACC will establish policy and
       procedures to support lead and user command responsibilities, IAW AFPD 11-2, Aircraft
       Rules and Procedures.
       4.4.1.2. AFSOC is the lead MAJCOM for all Group 1 through 3 sUAS operations per
       AFPD 10-9. AFSOC/A3OU is the primary POC for integration and COA issues.
       AFSOC will establish policy and procedures to support lead and user command
       responsibilities IAW AFPD 11-5, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS) Rules,
       Procedures, and Service.
   4.4.2. COA Reporting Requirements: Monthly operations reports are required to be
   submitted to the FAA via COA Online. RPA units (Groups 4 and 5) will track and report
   operational data requested directly to the FAA via COA Online. sUAS units (Groups 1
   through 3) will submit their operational data to AFSOC/A3OU via email
   (AFSOC.A3OU.WF@Hurlburt.AF.Mil). Reports will be submitted no later than 5
   working days after the end of the reporting period. Lead MAJCOM offices (ACC/A3AA and
   AFSOC/A3OU) will develop a process to ensure reports are submitted to the FAA no later
   than 7 working days after the end of the reporting period.
   4.4.3. Accident and Incident Reporting: Accident/incident data will be reported through the
   standard USAF safety process. AF/A3O-BA, in conjunction with the USAF Safety Center,
   will review the data and share appropriate data with the FAA. Units will not report
   accident/incident data directly to the FAA.
4.5. Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) Responsibilities. Disseminate time critical information
regarding changes impacting airspace (scheduling procedures, altitudes, etc.), either temporary or
not sufficiently known in advance, via NOTAM. A NOTAM may serve as notification of an
alteration until permanent publication on aeronautical charts or in other publications. It is the
responsibility of the airspace scheduling agency to ensure that NOTAMs are revised and
submitted in accordance with the FAA Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).
 30                                                             AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


4.6. Center Scheduling Enterprise (CSE). CSE is the Air Force wide web-based tool for the
scheduling, management and recording the utilization of airspace and ranges. All Air Force units
shall manage, schedule and report the utilization of airspace in CSE (SUA except Alert Areas).
4.7. Military Airspace Data Entry (MADE). Use of MADE streamlines the process for
scheduling of SUA between Air Force units and the FAA. All USAF units shall utilize MADE
for scheduling SUA. Inherent in CSE functionality is the ability to transmit SUA schedules
directly to MADE. Use of this functionality in CSE satisfies the requirement to use MADE.
AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                        31

                                    AIRSPACE REPORTS

5.1. Need for Reports. Report data is of ever-increasing value to airspace managers at all
levels. Accurate reporting is critical in many decisions affecting military airspace (e.g. BRAC
data collection, environmental impact analysis, legal actions, etc.). The CSE system will serve
as a repository for the data associated with airspace scheduling, management and utilization.
This repository will provide a real-time report generation capability to unit, wing, MAJCOM and
HAF as necessary.
5.2. Airspace Denial Report. Each USAF using agency shall maintain FAA denial information
in CSE. Until so equipped and trained, airspace denial reports will be submitted IAW
Attachment 10. Include both denials of airspace and restrictions on availability of military
airspace. MAJCOMs may stipulate other reporting requirements.
5.3. Annual Restricted Area and Military Operations Area (MOA) Utilization
Reports. CSE has the capability to generate the Annual Reports per FAA JO 7400.2 and will be
used to submit these reports for all US States (including territories and possessions). Once CSE
is in use at a location, the development of the Annual Reports is not required covering that period
forward. Reports for the period of time prior to CSE implementation will be submitted as
follows:
   5.3.1. Each USAF scheduling agency must submit a Restricted Area Utilization Report NLT
   1 January each year, covering the period from 1 October through 30 September which was
   not recorded in CSE. Prepare reports according to FAA JO 7400.2. Submit these reports for
   all US (including territories and possessions) restricted areas.
       5.3.1.1. Send the restricted area utilization report through the MAJCOM to the AFREP.
       Assign the Interagency Report Control Number (IRCN) 1412-DOT-AN.
       5.3.1.2. ANG units report directly through their State Adjutant General to the regional
       AFREP and send an information copy to NGB/A3A.
       5.3.1.3. The AFREP will send one copy to the Director of Operations in the FAA service
       area having jurisdiction over the airspace being reported; one copy to the Director of
       System Operations Airspace and AIM, Federal Aviation Administration, 800
       Independence Avenue, SW, Room 400E, Washington, DC 20591; and one copy to
       AF/A3O-BA, 112 Luke Ave Suite 340, Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, DC 20032.
   5.3.2. Each USAF scheduling agency must submit a MOA utilization report NLT 1 January
   each year covering the period from 1 October through 30 September which was not recorded
   in CSE. Prepare reports according to FAA JO 7400.2. Submit these reports for all US
   (including territories and possessions) MOAs.
       5.3.2.1. Send this report through MAJCOM to the AFREP. Assign the IRCN 1412-
       DOT-AN.
       5.3.2.2. ANG units must report directly through their State Adjutant General to the
       regional AFREP and send an info copy to NGB/A3A.
 32                                                              AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


       5.3.2.3. The AFREP will send one copy to the Director of Operations in the FAA service
       area having jurisdiction over the airspace being reported; one copy to the Director of
       System Operations Airspace and AIM, Federal Aviation Administration, 800
       Independence Avenue, SW, Room 400E, Washington, DC 20591; and one copy to
       AF/A3O-BA, 112 Luke Ave Bldg 5683 Suite 340, Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, DC
       20032.
5.4. Release of SUA/ASU Utilization Data. Although the USAF does not release detailed
information to the public, generic data (i.e., we flew XX sorties on XX route, MOA, etc., during
the month of _______) is an acceptable response to inquiries requesting information on
SUA/ASU utilization. More detailed data should be considered For Official Use Only.
5.5. Military Training Route (MTR) Evaluations. MTR evaluations consist of both a route
review and annual flight evaluations. Units with scheduling authority for an MTR will conduct
and document both evaluations for all MTRs with a floor at or below 1,500 feet Above Ground
Level (AGL) by the last day of the anniversary month of publication, or month of the last flight
evaluation. Failure to complete them in the prescribed time limits requires closing the
route/segment, unless waived by the MAJCOM (or NAF when delegated by the MAJCOM). All
MTRs shall be surveyed across their entire route width and length and aircrew route briefing
guides updated to reflect new areas of concern. The SUA/MTR Review, Attachment 9, contains
additional information required when reviewing MTRs.
   5.5.1. Route reviews should be conducted by the unit airspace manager using the Chart
   Updating Manual (CHUM), FLIP AP/1B, Sectional Aeronautical Charts, Tactical Pilotage
   Charts, and other aeronautical charts. Route reviews should annotate the following:
       5.5.1.1. Charted/uncharted obstacles or hazards within 100 feet of the MTR floor and 2
       NM of the lateral boundary.
       5.5.1.2. Entry/exit/route segment within 5 NM of public-use airports.
       5.5.1.3. Entry/exit/route segment within 5 NM of Class B, C, and D airspace. Also
       consider Class E airspace associated with non-towered airports and instrument approach
       procedures.
       5.5.1.4. Entry/exit/route segment within 5 NM of airways and charted visual flight rules
       (VFR) flyways.
       5.5.1.5. Potential bird attractant areas within 2 NM of a route where large concentrations
       of birds may be present.
       5.5.1.6. Potential noise-sensitive areas within 3 NM of a route. Review areas where
       restrictions are identified to minimize the impact of noise.
       5.5.1.7. TFRs established by FAA NOTAMs/Defense Internet NOTAM Service (DINS)
       (i.e., DoI environmentally sensitive animal breeding areas or parachute jumping areas).
       5.5.1.8. Other potential flight safety hazards.
       5.5.1.9. Verify the accuracy of aircrew route briefings and ensure MTR Special
       Operating Procedures and Remarks published in FLIP AP/1B are accurate and complete.
       Review previous route evaluations to ensure any other previously identified findings have
       been appropriately addressed.
AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                       33


       5.5.1.10. Wing/base civil engineering environmental office shall review the route for
       environmentally sensitive areas.
   5.5.2. MTR Annual Flight Evaluation. The annual flight evaluation provides important data
   and complements the ongoing route evaluation program by continuing the operational check
   of the route, which ensures a comprehensive operational review of the MTR, as it is not
   completed under the same mission conditions (e.g., aircraft type, speed, required systems
   checks, etc.). Conduct the evaluation during the anniversary month of publication or the last
   day of the month in which the previous flight evaluation was accomplished (MTR segments
   with a floor higher than 1,500 feet AGL need not be evaluated).
       5.5.2.1. Unless waived by the MAJCOM, failure to meet the annual suspense shall
       preclude the use of MTRs until evaluation requirements are met.
       5.5.2.2. Evaluations should be conducted at low airspeeds to allow more time for
       observation. Evaluation aircraft should be either conventional aircraft capable of low
       airspeeds or helicopters. The evaluation should be conducted at the slowest operational
       airspeed consistent with the type of aircraft normally flying the route. Use of Civil Air
       Patrol, aero club, or contract/charter is acceptable, but not required.
       5.5.2.3. The route should be evaluated to ensure obstruction clearance at the minimum
       altitude usable for training. The evaluation aircrew should consider the route‘s minimum
       defined altitude when considering an obstacle‘s flight safety potential, as other units may
       train at lower altitudes. If possible, the airspace manager should act as a pilot or as an
       observer on as many evaluation flights as possible. Commanders are encouraged that
       Non-Rated Airspace Managers are given unrestricted Mission Essential Ground
       Personnel status as a requirement to accomplish this route evaluation program.
       5.5.2.4. Flight evaluation crew members should be familiar with low-altitude flying and
       evaluation requirements. They should receive a pre-brief from the scheduling activity
       and provide a de-briefing to the scheduling activity.
       5.5.2.5. The scheduling activity, in coordination with the airspace manager, must
       develop an MTR survey schedule. The airspace manager must ensure the necessary
       charts are available for the evaluation and inform the OE/AAA Program Manager of
       uncharted obstructions within 100 feet below the floor and within 2 NM of the lateral
       boundary of the MTR or any other hazards to air traffic affecting low-altitude navigation.
       5.5.2.6. Routes less than 4 NM wide may require two passes on each side of the
       centerline. Routes greater than 4 NM wide may require additional passes to complete an
       adequate evaluation. Route centerlines are established for charting and route width
       measurement purposes only and may not require a direct pass.
       5.5.2.7. All users must be alert for new obstructions/hazards. Aircrews should be briefed
       to report any observed construction (i.e., temporary cranes, mines, temporary helipads,
       etc.) or uncharted obstructions/hazards to the scheduling agency/airspace manager.
       Information should include latitude and longitude coordinates, estimated height, and
       description of each obstruction/hazard.
NOTE: Professional judgment is the key to effective evaluations. Visual acuity may vary
greatly and the parameters above are provided as guidelines only. Evaluation aircrews must
 34                                                                 AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


consider the impact of foliage, haze, clouds, fog contrast (light), airspeed/ground speed, terrain,
snow, and task saturation.
       5.5.2.8. The evaluation aircrew should consider the following when conducting
       evaluations:
           5.5.2.8.1. Accuracy, adequacy, and availability of mission planning materials for the
           route.
           5.5.2.8.2. Accuracy and completeness of the aircrew route briefing.
           5.5.2.8.3. Potential hazards during entry and exit procedures, to include possible

   5.5.3. Route evaluations are intended as ongoing operational checks of how a specific route
   is mission planned, entered, flown, and exited during day-to-day operations. Route
   evaluations are used to document uncharted or undocumented obstacles, environmentally
   sensitive areas, and other potential flight safety hazards, to include planning deficiencies and
   potential flight conflicts with other routes, Class B, C, and D airspace, and air traffic service
   procedures. Data gathered during route evaluations is used to recommend changes to USAF
   policy and procedures and to update in-flight guides, FLIP, and other pertinent publications.
   Airspace managers should work with route schedulers and users to develop local evaluation
   methods to facilitate effective route evaluation by users and document follow-up and
   corrective action taken to alleviate flight safety hazards identified during evaluations.

                                          Chapter 6

                 DEVELOPMENT AND OBSTRUCTION EVALUATION

6.1. General. The purpose of the Development and Obstruction evaluation is to identify and
evaluate projects which may adversely affect operations associated with military airfields,
ranges, and airspace. This process includes both formal OE/AAA requests (Attachments 11-14)
submitted by the FAA and similar requests received from other agencies such as BLM. The
program described in this chapter applies only to projects in CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam and
Puerto Rico. Successful execution depends on unity of effort at all levels.
6.2. Responsibilities.
   6.2.1. AF/A3O-BA. Develops overall policy and procedures for USAF implementation of
   the evaluation program. Assists MAJCOMs with development and submission of impact
   assessments to Headquarters-level review committees. Oversees and manages the activities
   of the OE/AAA Program Manager and Specialists. Provides operational expertise for the
   HAF Encroachment Management Working Group (EMWG).
   6.2.2. OE/AAA Program Manager. Oversees daily operations and training for the OE/AAA
   program. Interfaces with other DoD services and FAA Obstruction Evaluation Group (OEG)
   personnel. Ensures modifications and enhancements to DoD modules of the FAA OE/AAA
   system are tested prior to implementation.
   6.2.3. OE/AAA Specialist. Distributes Obstruction Evaluations/Landing Area proposals
   affecting military airspace to the applicable airspace manager, MAJCOM and unit Terminal
   Procedures (TERPS) specialists consistent with current DoD and AF procedures.
   6.2.4. MAJCOM. Responds to OE/AAA taskings on behalf of the unit if the unit airspace
   manager/TERPS specialist is unable to do so. Reviews unit impact assessments for adequacy
   and completeness. Presents and advocates for impact assessments at Headquarters-level
   review committees.
   6.2.5. Unit Airspace Manager. Evaluates proposals and determines the technical and
   operational impacts on military operations. When applicable, ensure TERPS and other
   evaluations are completed and considered in the operational impacts evaluation. Responds,
   in writing, to proposed construction or landing area proposals in accordance with the
   procedures defined in this chapter.
   6.2.6. AFFSA. Evaluates proposals for technical impact to AF Navigational Aids
   (NAVAIDS) and terminal radars.
6.3. Processing Evaluations.
   6.3.1. FAA OE/AAA Requests: In accordance with section 358 of the 2011 National
   Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 111-383), OE/AAA requests from the FAA will be
   coordinated by the DoD Siting Clearinghouse. The Clearinghouse will distribute the requests
   through individual service channels to the affected airspace managers. Unit responses will be
   submitted through the MAJCOM to the Clearinghouse. Cases that present major impacts to
   operations require additional coordination and approval at the HAF, as described in
   paragraph 6.5. IAW Public Law 111-383, DoD has 30 days to provide a preliminary
AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                       37


   response to FAA OE/AAA requests.               AF personnel at all levels shall expedite
   reviews/processing to ensure DoD meets the required suspense. The tasking will have a
   shorter deadline, as the 30 day timeline includes coordination with the Office of the Secretary
   of Defense.
   6.3.2. Non-FAA OE/AAA Requests: Other agencies (e.g., BLM) may request the DoD
   opinion on proposed projects outside the formal FAA process. These requests may be
   received at any level, including the individual unit. Units and MAJCOMs receiving direct
   requests from non-DoD entities shall ensure the request is forwarded to the HAF
   Encroachment Management Working Group to facilitate coordination with Office of the
   Secretary of Defense and other services. Airspace managers will evaluate requests and
   develop unit responses to be submitted through the MAJCOM to the Clearinghouse. Non-
   FAA requests are not subject to the 30 day initial response window established in Public Law
   111-383, but may have an associated deadline as outlined in 6.3.1.
   6.3.3. Informal Feedback: The best opportunity to eliminate or minimize operational
   impacts occurs early in the project scoping period (before the proponent has invested in land
   use rights, finalized designs, obtained permits, etc.). Through early engagement, the project
   proponent may be willing and able to adjust the proposal to alleviate impacts to USAF
   operations. Unit-level organizations may provide informal feedback to developers and local
   entities on potential mission impacts from proposed projects, but must ensure the requestor
   understands the feedback does not constitute the official USAF or DoD position. Any
   official response must be coordinated, reviewed, and approved at the DoD level in
   accordance with the procedures described in paragraphs 6.3.1 and 6.3.2.
6.4. Impact Assessments
   6.4.1. General guidance for managing energy development impacts on USAF operations are
   provided at Attachment 15. The parent MAJCOM, Regional Office (RO)/Regional
   Environmental Coordinator (REC), and AF/A3O-BA will support airspace managers as
   needed.
   6.4.2. Effects from traditional obstructions, such as buildings and antennae, are typically
   direct (physical obstacle). Some proposals (particularly renewable energy projects) may also
   present indirect effects, such as interference with radar performance.
   6.4.3. Requests for additional technical review shall be routed through the MAJCOM to
   AF/A3O-BA. AF/A3O-BA will engage radar experts and other stakeholders, as appropriate.
   6.4.4. Regardless of the type of proposal, all assessments and associated responses must
   focus on mission impact.
   6.4.5. All proposals must be designated in one of the four following categories:
      6.4.5.1. Category 1: Minor/No Impact. Project will have no impact or an impact that can
      be easily overcome with little or no impact to mission.
      6.4.5.2. Category 2: Impact/No objection. Project has impacts to military operations and
      readiness, but do not warrant an objection through this process.
      6.4.5.3. Category 3: Major Impact/ Mitigation Required. This category includes projects
      that have an impact that will require mitigation. Subsequent negotiations with the
      developer will determine whether any mitigation options are viable.
 38                                                              AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


      6.4.5.4. Category 4: Critical Impact/ No Mitigation Possible. Projects in this category
      must present an unacceptable adverse impact on military operations that cannot be
      overcome by known mitigation techniques.
6.5. Determinations of Major or Critical Impact
   6.5.1. All Category 3 or 4 findings will be validated and approved at the appropriate level.
   In accordance with Public Law 111-383, the Secretary of Defense shall review the project
   and provide an assessment of the level of risk of adverse impact on military operations and
   readiness that would arise from the project and the extent of mitigation that may be needed to
   address such risk.
   6.5.2. MAJCOMs will determine the required content and format for unit-level OE/AAA
   responses. At a minimum, Category 3 or 4 recommendations submitted by the MAJCOM
   shall contain adequate detail on the following:
      6.5.2.1. Technical Impact. The technical impact describes the proposal‘s effect on
      airfield/range operations and procedures. Examples include changes to the minimum
      vectoring altitude, or significant reductions in radar coverage.
      6.5.2.2. Operational Impact. The operational impact describes the adverse effect on
      mission accomplishment. It must be based on the technical impact described above.
      Some technical impacts will have natural operational impacts, others will not.
   6.5.3. MAJCOMs shall brief proposed Category 3 or 4 findings at Headquarters-level review
   committees. Required forums may include the EMWG, the SB-ESG, or both. AF/A3O-BA
   will facilitate MAJCOM participation in these groups.
   6.5.4. Once approved by the appropriate review function, the proposed Category 3 or 4
   finding will be reviewed by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. If approved by the Chief of
   Staff, the determination will be forwarded to the Siting Clearinghouse for DoD coordination.
6.6. Impact Mitigation
   6.6.1. Recommendations for a Category 3 response ―Major Impact/Mitigation Required‖
   shall include potential measures to mitigate the technical and/or operational impacts.
   Options should be objective and may include a range of potential actions by the developer
   (proponent), the AF, or both.
   6.6.2. Recommendations for a Category 4 response ―Critical Impact/ No Mitigation
   Possible‖ shall include a summary of any mitigation techniques that were considered, and the
   reason they are not acceptable.
   6.6.3. IAW Public Law 111-383, the AF will engage the developer to explore mitigations
   after designation by the OSD Siting Clearinghouse adverse impact to military operations and
   readiness.
   6.6.4. Unit-level personnel have the most in-depth knowledge of local conditions and should
   be at the forefront of all mitigation discussions; however they are not expected to bear the
AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                               39


  full burden of negotiations. MAJCOM and Air Staff personnel shall assist units to ensure
  consistency across the CONUS and to provide expertise not resident at the unit level.

Terms
Aeronautical Objection— A written objection to proposed construction, an airspace proposal,
or a proposed facility that infringes (or is believed to infringe) on the safe, orderly, and
expeditious flow of air traffic.
Aeronautical Proposal— A written proposal of (but not limited to) construction of any new
airport, any manmade obstruction that would extend into navigable airspace, establishment or
change of SUA (including any special or unusual ATC procedures) or establishment of or change
to any new or existing NAVAID. Accomplish the preliminary review process (T/TSNS) IAW
Chapter 3 prior to initiating any aeronautical proposal action associated with establishment or
change of SUA.
Aerial Refueling (AR) Airspace— Airspace developed to conduct air refueling. Permanent air
refueling airspace is designated as either a track or an anchor or established via a letter of
agreement (LOA) with the appropriate ATC facility responsible for the airspace. After
coordination with ATC, refueling routes or anchors are processed through the appropriate
AFREP for publication in FLIP. Temporary or special AR airspace may also be established by
coordination/agreement with the ATC facility having purview over the airspace (FAA JO
7610.4).
Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA)— Airspace of defined vertical/lateral limits,
assigned by ATC, for the purpose of providing air traffic segregation between the specified
activities being conducted within the assigned airspace and other Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
traffic (FAA JO 7610.4).
Airspace Action— The procedural act of designation, redesignation, modification, or revocation
of a parcel of airspace.
Airspace Concept— For identification purposes, informal initial requests for additional military
airspace are referred to as ‗concepts‘ and is part of the T/TSNS process.
Airspace for Special Use (ASU)— Used to collectively identify non-SUA assets. ASU is
airspace of defined dimensions wherein activities must be confined because of their nature, and/
or wherein limitations may be imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those
activities.
Airspace for Special Use (ASU) Designations— These designations are in FAA JO 7610.4 or
military documents. None are rulemaking actions and some (contained solely in military
documents) do not require coordination with the FAA for establishment.
 46                                                               AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


Airspace Proposal— Having been through the T/TSNS process, an airspace proposal is the
formal portion of requests for airspace through the FAA. There must be a clearly defined need
and justification for obtaining or revising airspace.
Alert Area— Airspace which may contain a high volume of pilot training activities or an
unusual type of aerial activity neither of which is hazardous to aircraft. (FAA JO 7400.8)
Altitude Reservation (ALTRV)— Airspace utilization under prescribed conditions normally
employed for the mass movement of aircraft or other special user requirements which cannot
otherwise be accomplished. ALTRVs are approved by the appropriate FAA facility or the
Central Altitude Reservation Function (CARF). They can be either Moving or Stationary. (FAA
JO 7610.4)
Concurrent Use— The use of a portion of Special Use Airspace (SUA) for a specifically
defined period of time, by multiple flights, units or events who in coordination with each other
and the scheduling agency, have mutually agreed to procedurally deconflict their operations, thus
allowing simultaneous or concurrent use of the SUA to accomplish multiple missions or events.
Concurrent use maximizes the availability of limited SUA resources for a larger population of
users. Units must spell out limitations (maximum number of aircraft) and deconfliction
procedures (north/south or high low division) in their range regulation or base airfield operations
instruction.
Controlled Firing Area (CFA)— A controlled firing area (CFA) is airspace designated to
contain activities that if not conducted in a controlled environment would be hazardous to
nonparticipating aircraft. CFAs provide a means to accommodate, without impact to aviation,
certain hazardous activities that can be immediately suspended if a nonparticipating aircraft
approaches the area. (CFAs are not charted and their volume is only defined locally). (FAA JO
7400.2)
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)— The codification of the general and permanent rules
published in the Federal Register by the executive departments and agencies of the Federal
Government. It is divided into 50 titles that represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation.
Each volume of the CFR is updated once each calendar year and is issued on a quarterly basis.
14 CFR represents Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which contains the Federal
Aviation Regulation (FAR) parts.
Cruise Missile Routes— Cruise missile operations conducted in excess of 250 knots and below
10,000 feet MSL that are conducted in restricted areas, MOAs, and along selected IRs during
daylight hours under VFR conditions. Cruise missiles are accompanied by two escort aircraft
that have the ability to maneuver the missile out of the flight path of conflicting traffic at all
times.
Dynamic (Adaptive) and Predictable Airspace— This concept involves establishing airspace
by tailoring airspace boundaries to meet specific operational requirements. This concept further
ensures the integrity of the NAS by only activating the required volume of airspace, for the exact
period of time, to meet stated operational requirements. This allows airspace planners, both civil
and military, to plan accordingly to maximize NAS effectiveness.
Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP)— The process, as outlined in 32 CFR 989,
used to assess environmental impacts resulting from a proposed action.
AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                          47


Exclusive Use— The use of a portion of Special Use Airspace (SUA) for a defined period of
time, solely by one unit, mission or group briefed to operate singularly within SUA; that due to
the nature of the event or special test evolution and to maintain safety of flight, cannot accept the
potential encumbrance of nonparticipating aircraft. Users and scheduling agencies shall restrict
the exclusive use of SUA to the greatest extent practicable to only those few events whose
accomplishment cannot be met through the concurrent use of the SUA. Exclusive use limits the
availability of limited SUA resources and restricts usage to a small population of users.
Federal Register— An official publication that provides a uniformed system for making
regulations and legal notices issued by Federal agencies available to the public. These include
Presidential proclamations and executive orders, Federal agency documents having general
applicability and legal effect, documents required to be published by an Act of Congress, and
other Federal agency documents of public interest. All rulemaking actions are published in the
Federal Register.
Global Area Reference System (GARS)— A two-dimensional (2-D) framework from which 3-
D control and coordination measures can be constructed. The National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency (NGA) developed GARS to provide a worldwide standard for DoD mission planning
and operations. More information is available in Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Instruction, CJCSI 3900.02. GARS can be applied to SUA with a temporal addition to provide a
4-D method for allocating and coordinating airspace.
Instrument Routes (IR)— Routes used by the DoD and associated Reserve and Air Guard units
for the purpose of conducting low-altitude navigation and tactical training in both IFR and VFR
weather conditions at airspeeds in excess of 250 KIAS below 10,000 ft MSL. (FAA JO 7610.4)
Joint Use— Under the ‗joint-use‘ concept, SUA is released to the controlling agency and
becomes available for access by non-participating aircraft during periods when the airspace is
not needed by the using agency for its designated purpose. Such use enhances safety and
benefits the NAS. The USAF encourages the use of military radar units and the provisions of
military air traffic services for SUA complexes when such services are available to enhance
safety and utility.
Local Flying Areas— Most military facilities develop local flying areas within which they can
conduct routine, training activity. These areas are normally developed in conjunction with local
FAA controllers and airspace managers and are de-conflicted with other airspace such as Class
B, C, or D airspace, SUA, or ASU.
Low—Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) Area - Usually large geographic areas established
for random VFR, low altitude navigation training to preclude flying over the same point more
than once per day. Activities are in accordance with all applicable FARs and flown at an
airspeed of 250 knots or less. MAJCOMs will determine establishment criteria. There is no
required coordination with the FAA. LATN areas are not published on aeronautical charts.
Environmental documentation in accordance with Title 32 CFR Part 989 is required. Send
copies of LATN areas to the appropriate AFREP. A full description of the LATN area(s) and any
restrictions will be maintained in the unit flight operations office.
Maneuver Area— A designated segment of an IR or VR where aircraft may perform various
maneuvers dictated by operational requirements.      The entire MTR is considered a
Corridor/Maneuver Area except where stated otherwise in FLIP. Aircraft vary their route of
 48                                                               AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


flight and altitudes in the corridor to avoid obstacles, reduce noise impacts, and achieve IFR or
VFR point-to-point navigation and tactical training. Maneuver areas are not substitutes for
MOAs. Do not develop maneuver areas in lieu of MOAs. Include details of maneuver area
operations in the IR/VR proposal.
Military Airspace— Also known as SAA, a collective term used to indicate both SUA and
ASU.
MADE (Military Airspace Data Entry)— A web based tool used to deliver special use
airspace schedules to the overlying FAA ATC facility with SUA responsibility. This tool
replaces older phone, fax and email methods.
Military Briefing Guides— Unit maintained briefing guides for each MTR that include route
deconfliction procedures, special operating procedures, and/or constraints not listed in current
FLIP AP/ 1B.
Military Operations Area (MOA)— Airspace designated outside of Class A airspace to
separate or segregate certain nonhazardous military activities from IFR Traffic and to identify for
Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic where these activities are conducted. MOAs are designated to
contain nonhazardous, military flight activities including, but not limited to, air combat
maneuvers, air intercepts, low altitude tactics, etc. (FAA JO 7400.2).
Military Training Routes (MTR)— The MTR program is established by the FAA and the DoD
for the purpose of conducting low-altitude and/or high-speed training. Generally, MTRs are
established below 10,000 feet MSL for operations at speeds in excess of 250 knots. Each
segment of an MTR route is allocated a floor and ceiling altitude and lateral boundaries,
described in NM left and right of centerline. MTRs are established according to the criteria in
FAA JO 7610.4. Routes are established as either IR or VR. The DoD has a speed exemption to
14 CFR Part 91.117 (see FAA JO 7610.4). The FAA has approval authority over IR
establishment and the appropriate MAJCOM approves establishment of VRs. Environmental
documentation in accordance with Title 32 CFR Part 989, is required to establish MTRs. VRs
are processed through the FAA via the AFREP. AFREPs assign all route numbers. Ultimately,
MTRs are published in FLIP AP/1B and charted on FLIP AP/1B Area Planning Chart, and FAA
sectional charts. Some MTRs are on DoD Low IFR enroute charts.
National Security Area (NSA)— A national security area (NSA) consists of airspace of defined
vertical and lateral dimensions established at locations where there is a requirement for increased
security of ground facilities. The purpose of such national security areas is to request pilot
cooperation by voluntarily avoiding flight through the NSA. When circumstances dictate a need
for a greater level of security, flight may be temporarily prohibited by regulation under the
provisions of 14 CFR 99.7, Special Security Instructions. Such prohibitions will be issued by
FAA Headquarters and disseminated via the US NOTAM System. (FAA JO 7400.8)
Non—rulemaking Actions - Cases relating to FAA decisions or activities affecting airspace for
which FAA does not generally issue a rule, regulation, or order. These actions include
establishing (or eliminating) FAA or military NAVAIDs as well as designating controlled firing
areas, alert areas, MOAs, warning areas, and airports provided the action of one of these items
does not impact on a mandatory rulemaking action.
AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                        49


Orbit Area— This activity is used to occupy an expanded area used for holding or maneuvering
aircraft. Orbit areas are used by DoD surveillance aircraft (e.g. E-2, E-3, E-8) and are normally
contained within ATCAAs. (FAA JO 7610.4)
Planning Requirements in the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (PREIAP)—
PREIAP ensures the early identification of appropriate requirements, collection of pertinent
baseline data and agreement among key stakeholders on the proponent‘s Draft Description of
Proposed Action and Alternatives (DOPAA). Air Force installations or major commands
(MAJCOMs) will follow the PREIAP process for all EISs and EAs of special concern. To the
extent possible, accomplishment of these procedures will occur prior to initiation of the formal
NEPA analysis process. PREIAP does not change the requirements of 32 CFR Part 989 and will
not provide any authority for challenging Air Force decisions or actions. PREIAP highlights the
importance of existing, on-going proponent responsibilities.
Prohibited Area— A prohibited area is airspace established under Title 14 CFR part 73
provisions, within which no person may operate an aircraft without permission of the using
agency. Prohibited areas are established when necessary to prohibit flight over an area on the
surface in the interest of national security and welfare. (FAA JO 7400.2).
Restricted Area— A restricted area is airspace established under 14 CFR Part 73 provisions,
within which the flight of aircraft, while not wholly prohibited, is subject to restriction.
Restricted Areas are established when determined necessary to confine or segregate activities
considered hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft. (FAA JO 7400.2)
Rulemaking Actions— Procedures where FAA assigns, changes, or rescinds airspace and
manages its use by rule, regulation, or order. These actions include establishing (or eliminating)
jet routes, airways, restricted areas, prohibited areas, and various classes of airspace.
Slow Speed Low Altitude Training Routes (SR)— Low-level training routes used for military
air operations conducted at or below 1,500 feet AGL at airspeed of 250 knots or less. Unlike IR
and VR MTRs, SRs are not technically part of the MTR system and therefore have no directive
guidance in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) or FAAO 7610.4. MAJCOMs will
determine establishment criteria. There is no requirement for coordination with the FAA. SRs are
published in FLIP AP/1B; however, they are not published on aeronautical charts. Environmental
documentation in accordance with 32 CFR Part 989 is required. There is no overall mechanism
to inform military or civilian aviators that an SR is active, as Automated Flight Services Stations
are not notified. A full description of the SRs and any restrictions will be maintained in the unit
flight operations office. (FAA JO 7610.4)
Special Activity Airspace (SAA)— Any airspace with defined dimensions within the National
Airspace System wherein limitations may be imposed upon aircraft operations. This airspace
may be restricted areas, prohibited areas, military operations areas, ATC assigned airspace, and
any other designated airspace areas.
Special Use Airspace (SUA)— Airspace that is of a defined vertical and lateral dimension that
alerts users to areas of unusual flight hazards and separates those activities from other airspace
users to enhance safety. Certain limitations or restrictions may be placed on non-participating
aircraft.
Temporary Airspace— There are multiple types of temporary airspace that can be utilized to
meet temporary requirements or for exercise planning. A temporary MOA, temporary restricted
 50                                                               AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


area or stationary Altitude Reservation (ALTRV) can meet these temporary requirements, but are
not designed to circumvent the process of establishing permanent SUA. Existing SUA must be
used to the maximum extent possible to meet temporary airspace requirements. FAA guidance
on temporary MOAs and Restricted Areas is contained in FAA JO 7400.2. Stationary ALTRV
guidance is listed in FAA JO 7610.4.
Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR)— TFR is a type of Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). A TFR
defines an area restricted to air travel due to a geographically-limited, short-term, airspace
restriction. Temporary flight restrictions often encompass hazard/natural disaster areas (Title 14
CFR section 91.137(a)(1-3)) TFRs are used for: Air shows (Title 14 CFR section 91.145); Space
launches (Title 14 CFR section 91.143); Presidential/VIP movements (Title 14 CFR section
91.141); or Special Security Instructions/National Special Security Events (Title 14 CFR section
99.7)
Temporary Special Use Airspace (TSUA)— The military and the FAA have the ability to
create Temporary Military Operations Areas or Temporary Restricted Areas to accommodate the
specific needs of a particular military exercise. This information is available via either the
NOTAM system or by direct contact with the FAA Regional Headquarters. TSUAs are usually
established to accommodate the military's need for additional airspace to periodically conduct
exercises that supplement routine training, when existing airspace is inadequate to accommodate
these short-term military exercises, TSUA actions are coordinated through the cognizant FAA
Regional/Service Area Office.(FAA JO 7400.2)
Test/Training Space (T/TS)— Any air, land, or sea area that is used to conduct military training
or operational activities.
Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)— Are further defined as:
Group 1 (sUAS): Typically weighs up to 20 pounds and normally operates below 1,200 feet
AGL at speeds less than 100 knots.
Group 2 (sUAS): Typically weighs 21—55 pounds and normally operates below 3,500 feet
AGL at speeds less than 250 knots.
Group 3 (sUAS): Typically weighs more than 55 pounds but, less than 1,320 pounds and
normally operates below 18,000 feet MSL at speeds less than 250 knots.
Group 4 (RPA): Typically weighs more than 1,320 pounds and normally operates below 18,000
feet MSL at any speed.
Group 5 (RPA): Typically weighs more than 1,320 pounds and normally operates higher than
18,000 feet MSL at any speed.
Visual Routes (VR)— Routes used by the DoD and associated Reserve and Air Guard units for
the purpose of conducting low-altitude navigation and tactical training under VFR conditions at
airspeeds in excess of 250 KIAS below 10,000 ft MSL. (FAA JO 7610.4)
Warning Area— A non-regulatory warning area is airspace of defined dimensions designated
over international waters (3 or 12 nautical miles (NM) outward from the coast of the United
States) that contains activity which may be hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft. The purpose of
such warning areas is to warn nonparticipating pilots of the potential danger. (FAA JO 7400.8)
AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                     51

             LETTER OF AUTHORITY, USAF REPRESENTATIVE TO FAA

MEMORANDUM FOR (Grade and Name of AFREP)

FROM: (Grade and Name, as appropriate)

SUBJECT: Letter of Authority

1. This letter hereby designates you as the Air Force Representative, FAA (location) and
constitutes authority for you to formulate, within established policy and guidance, the
Department of the Air Force position on airspace and air traffic control matters that fall within
the purview of the FAA (location) Service Area (or Headquarters).

2. In executing the duties of your office, you are also the representative of Headquarters, United
States Air Force, and within established policy and guidance are authorized to coordinate and
negotiate on all matters of mutual interest to the Air Force and the FAA (location) Service Area
(or Headquarters).




                                                NAME, RANK, USAF

AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                          55


                                          Attachment 6
                     T/TSNS INSTRUCTIONS AND SAMPLE T/TSNS

A6.1. The T/TSNS is the avenue which units can voice a requirement up to the MAJCOM and
Air Staff. Keep in mind the audience that reviews this document: airspace managers,
environmental planning specialists, legal professionals, and the AFREP. Some of these persons
may not be familiar with your unit or the potential issues with your mission.
A6.2. The T/TSNS is the precursor to the DOPAA. If done properly, the T/TSNS is the initial
scrub of the key issues that will be explored in great detail through the environmental and
aeronautical processing of the formal proposal once submitted to the FAA. The T/TSNS is
organized as outlined below.
   A6.2.1. Chapter 1: Title. Explain what this proposal is trying to accomplish through this
   T/TSNS. Give a brief overview of the options being pursued in this T/TSNS (which will be
   explained further in chapter 3).
   A6.2.2. Chapter 2: Operational Requirement/Justification. This should be based on factual
   data. Examples include RAP shortage/delta, flying hour delta, current airspace not of
   sufficient volume to meet requirements (as specified in an AFI or other regulatory guidance),
   or other deficiencies in the proximity, time, or attributes as defined in the Air Force Ranges
   Strategic Vision (Dec 06). If there are other specific units that support this initiative, list
   those units and why they require this airspace modification and provide similar factual
   justification as listed above.
   A6.2.3. Chapter 3: Concept/Proposed Actions. It is preferred that units look at more than
   one possible modification to meet their requirements. It is better to analyze more than one
   action, if feasible, so as to prevent the appearance of being pre-decisional. This requires
   equal analysis of all proposed actions. Only actions that meet the stated operational
   requirements should be mentioned here. For those options considered but not meeting
   operational requirements, list those under Chapter 4: Alternatives as ―Actions Considered
   But Not Carried Forward‖ with the rationale as to why these options could not meet the
   requirements.
   A6.2.4. Chapter 4: Alternatives. A no-action alternative must be specified. As stated
   earlier, Actions Considered But Not Carried Forward should be included here to demonstrate
   other options that could be suggested by other airspace stakeholders (civil aviation, Park
   Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, etc) have been reviewed, but cannot meet the stated
   requirements.
   A6.2.5. Chapter 5: Aeronautical Coordination. As specified in this AFI, the Air Route
   Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) must be coordinated with prior to forwarding this T/TSNS.
   Without this coordination, this concept is a wish list. The ARTCC will provide guidance on
   how this will impact air traffic flow for that affected area. If the proposal will affect terminal
   airspace, the applicable approach controls should also be contacted to ensure all initial
   concerns are addressed and potentially resolved early. The more outreach conducted at this
   point will result in a smoother process later once the formal proposal is provided to the FAA.
   List any potential concerns that could be addressed later in the aeronautical or environmental
   processing of this proposal.
 56                                                              AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


   A6.2.6. Chapter 6: Other Interest Potential. This is the critical portion for the environmental
   side of the concept. Conduct thorough research to determine what potential issues can come
   about should the concept be approved to go forward as a formal proposal. If more than one
   proposed action meets the requirement, equal consideration must be given under each
   category for each option. MAJCOM Environmental Planning Office or AFREP may provide

1. Overview.

1.1. Concept/Purpose. This T/TSNS addresses the requirement to establish airspace sufficient
to accommodate AIM-120 AMRAAM missile tactics and LOWAT tactics. This T/TSNS looks
at the modification of the Milhouse Military Operations Area (MOA) and the Crowe MOA to
meet military training needs. The minimum altitudes of Milhouse 1 and Milhouse 2 MOAs
would be lowered to support Low-Altitude Training missions (LOWAT). The current maximum
altitudes for both Milhouse MOAs will remain unchanged, but will amend the boundaries to
accommodate the new requirement for the AIM-120/AMRAAM. The new MOA would be
divided into Milhouse 1 & 2 and Sideshow MOAs. The Crowe MOA would require the
lowering of the current MOA floor and the establishment of an ATCAA that mirrors the existing
Crowe MOA lateral boundaries. The 999th FW plans to analyze both MOA options in this
T/TSNS and in the NEPA process.

2.   Operational Requirements/Justification

2.1. Unit and Mission. The 999th Fighter Wing flies the F-16 out of Spaatz Air Force Base in
Springfield, NA. The F-16 is a multi-role fighter, with operations at all altitudes from surface to
50,000+ feet. Pilot operational and training requirements require missions to be accomplished in
the low, medium, and high altitude regimes. During a real world intercept, pilots are cleared to
descend down to LOWAT minimums or current pilot qualification, whichever is higher. If a
pilot is not current in LOWAT requirements, then the pilot is technically not legal to descend
down to lower altitudes where most real world intercepts take place. If a pilot does descend
lower than they are currently qualified, they are placing themselves and others, both in the air
and on the ground, at risk. Today, the alert tasking of the 999th Fighter Wing continues 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week, and the real world tasking does not allow for any of the wing‘s pilots to
lose their LOWAT currency. The concept to modify the Milhouse or Crowe MOA is the best
answer to the unit‘s training requirements.

Two years ago, the 999th Fighter Wing was converted from an air defense mission to a general-
purpose mission. It was originally conceived during the MAJCOM SATAF that the Tooey
 62                                                                AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


MOA could accommodate the LOWAT training requirements for this new mission. A review of
the past two years RAP data shows this is not the case (see table below), primarily because three
unit compete for this LOWAT airspace and it prevents all three units from meeting their RAP
requirements. Additionally, Spaatz AFB F-16s will be equipped with the AIM-120 AMRAAM
starting in six months. The minimum prescribed airspace for 65 NM AMRAAM set-ups is 85
miles. This allows the two forces to orbit without the other forces seeing the ―picture‖ too early.
As currently configured and at its longest length, the Milhouse MOA is only 60 NM in length,
but allows for two 60 X 25 NM segments of airspace. The Crowe MOA does allow for the 85 X
25 NM airspace segments, but has a floor of 5,000‘ MSL.

LOWAT mission definition and requirements are described in Air Force Instruction 11-2F-16V1.
LOWAT missions are defined as ―an event performing realistic, mission oriented air-to-air
operations while in a LOWAT certified low-altitude block (at or below 1,000 ft AGL)‖. A
minimum altitude less than 1,000‘ AGL is required in allow pilots to update their LOWAT
currency. RAP requirements for every qualified F-16 pilot include 16 LOWAT missions
annually, requiring 768 for the wing per year for 48 assigned aircrew members. A review of
wing RAP performance for the past two years shows that 20% or 153 missions were not
completed. In addition, pilots are not meeting RAP requirements for Low Slow/Visual
Identification intercepts and Slow Shadow intercepts, which are essential training for both Air-
Superiority and 24-hour Air Defense Alert role. Additionally, A-10s from Jones ANGB and
Smith ARB also require low altitude training airspace (24 assigned aircrew at each unit). Due to
high utilization of the Tooey MOA, these two units only complete 288 of 384 and 268 of 384
RAP requirements, respectively. Both Jones ANGB and Smith ARB support this initiative to
aid in overcoming their respective RAP shortfalls.
                                 RAP          Total
                                 Rqmts        Comp        Delta          Comp %
                  Spaatz         768          615         153            80%
                  Jones          384          288         96             75%
                  Smith          384          269         115            70%
                                                          364
2.2. Need for Low-Altitude Training Airspace. All three units currently use the Tooey MOA
and VR-999 to accomplish LOWAT training. Tooey MOA‘s activation period is limited to 12
hrs per day and it currently cannot meet the LOWAT RAP demand for all three units (combined
delta of 364 RAP missions). Jones ANGB attempted to expand Tooey MOA‘s effective times,
but there was resistance from the FAA and Harrison International Airport. VR-999 is a narrow,
one-way, low-level corridor, portions of which lie underneath the Milhouse MOA. This low-
level route does not allow LOWAT annual training requirements to be accomplished due to its
restrictive nature. Since VR-999 is a one-way route, it does not allow for reversing direction on
the route (defensive reactions) or intercepts from a high to low altitude regime on maneuvering
targets (LOWAT intercepts).

3. Concept/Proposed Airspace Actions

3.1. Modification of the Milhouse MOAs and Creation of the Sideshow MOA. The altitudes of
the current Milhouse 1 & 2 MOA airspace would have to be amended as stated below and shown
in Section 1.2 above: The Milhouse 1 and Milhouse 2 MOA‘s minimum altitude would be
AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                      63


lowered from the current 7,000‘ MSL to 5,000‘ MSL and the current boundaries for both
Milhouse MOA‘s will extend 20 NM east. The new AMRAAM requires 65-mile (minimum)
set-ups (85 NM airspace), and Milhouse MOA is only 60 miles in length, so the extension to the
east will allow the unit to train properly to their new RAP requirements. A new MOA, Sideshow
MOA, would be from 500‘ AGL up to but not including 5,000‘ MSL below the revised Milhouse
1 & 2 MOA. This would allow more efficient scheduling of airspace, since Sideshow MOA
would only be activated if F-16/A-10s were performing LOWAT missions. This MOA is
anticipated to be activated no more than four hours per day, five days a week (Monday – Friday).
The Milhouse 1 & 2 MOAs will continue to be activated at their current utilization rate.

3.2. Establishment of the Crowe 2 MOA and Big Brinley ATCAA. The Crowe MOA is of
required volume to support the AMRAAM requirements except it has no associated ATCAA
above the existing MOA to support either higher altitude operations or a floor sufficient for
LOWAT tactics. ATCAA airspace from FL 180 up to at least FL 230 is required to support F-16
air-to-air tactics. A lower MOA, the Crowe 2 MOA, would provide the perfect volume of
airspace for LOWAT training. The Crowe 2 MOA would meet the LOWAT mission
requirements of Spaatz AFB, Jones ANGB and Smith ARB with the same anticipated activation
of no more than four hours per day, five days a week (Monday – Friday).

4. Alternatives.

4.1. No Action Alternative. Twenty percent of the 999th FW pilots currently do not meet
requirements for annual LOWAT training and would continue to be deficient in this area without
appropriate low-level training airspace. The ability to perform real world Air Defense
Missions/Homeland Security Missions would continue to suffer due to the current LOWAT
training shortfall and could prevent us from successfully completing some Homeland Security
Missions (i.e. any requiring an intercept on an airborne target below 1,000‘ AGL).

4.2. Use of Other Airspace. The wing airspace office conducted a search of all LOWAT-capable
airspace within 125 miles of the home station. The Warning Areas that are use daily are entirely
over water. Air Force Regulations restrict us from training below 1000‘ MSL over the ocean due
to risk for spatial disorientation due to visual illusions that are common over the water at low
altitudes.

4.3. Actions Considered But Not Carried Forward.

4.3.1. Expansion of the Tooey MOA. The Tooey MOA is available 12 hours per day, 265 days
per year (Monday-Friday). The following shows the RAP deficiencies for LOWAT for the three
mentioned units:
The average daily                                                              utilization for
Tooey MOA is                         Authorized   Scheduled   Utilized         contained in the
following chart.       Tooey MOA 12.0             11.5        10.8             Authorized is the
maximum number of hours the MOA can be scheduled. Based on the current utilization rate,
there is not adequate time remaining to accommodate the LOWAT RAP delta. The 1.2 delta
between utilized and authorized is scattered throughout the day in between goes and does not
allow for a continuous block of time that would be useful to any of the units. This option was
 64                                                               AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


considered, but not pursued as Jefferson ARTCC said they could not support any lateral or time
extension of this MOA due to arrival and departure routes into numerous airports.

4.3.2. Lowering of Airspace under Milhouse 1 & 2 MOAs without the Eastern Expansion. This
option would allow us to meet out LOWAT RAP requirements, but presents problems for
AMRAAM training. AMRAAM requires 65-mile (minimum) set-ups (85 NM airspace), and
Milhouse MOA is only 60 miles in length. Tooey MOA is less than 85-miles in length and its
high utilization rate prevents the 999 FW from considering it for additional airspace usage.

4.3.3. Eastern Expansion without the Development of Sideshow MOA. This would allow us to
effectively meet the AMRAAM RAP requirements; however, all three units would still be
deficient due to inability to meet LOWAT RAP requirements.

4.3.4. Not Establishing the Big Brinley ATCAA. This option would be of limited value as
AMRAAM tactics require a volume of 18,000‘ of airspace. With the floor established at 5,000‘,
ATCAA airspace is required to effectively train using the AIM-120.

4.3.5. Deployment for LOWAT Training. This option would be prohibitively expensive to
implement requiring multiple deployments by the unit in order to fulfill the 153 LOWAT RAP
missions that are required by each pilot for Spaatz AFB. Estimates are that it would require three,
three-week deployments to other locations to meet 153 RAP delta for LOWAT (364 for all three
units). Given the cost estimate of the last two weapons deployment training TDYs ($160K and
$210K), this option is not economically feasible.

4.3.6. Use of the Adams MOA. This option was considered, but not pursued as this MOA is 155
miles from Spaatz AFB and would not permit training times of significant duration to
accomplish necessary training.

5. Aeronautical Coordination

On 1 Apr 07, an informal coordination meeting was held between Jefferson ARTCC and 999th
Fighter Wing representatives, with attendance from other affected agencies. Jefferson ARTCC
informed us that expansion of the Milhouse MOA to the north, west, or south would not be
supportable due to existing jet route and victor airway structures and arrival procedures into
Harrison International Airport. Feedback from this meeting is reflected throughout this T/TSNS,
with all affected agencies giving positive responses to the lowering of Milhouse MOA. One
airport, Monroe Regional Airport, voiced concerns over possible confliction with their ILS
approach procedure. Madison Approach Control was contacted to develop procedures to release
a portion of the proposed Sideshow MOA to Madison Approach when that airspace is needed to
protect IFR aircraft on the ILS approach to runway 13. The exact volume of airspace has not
been determined at this time; however, we will address this issue should this concept go forward
as a formal airspace proposal. Initial discussion suggested a subdivision of the Sideshow MOA.
Establishment of the Fat Brinley ATCAA above FL 210 would create traffic flow problems for
Jefferson ARTCC and exact shaping of that ATCAA would have to allow for the expanding
waypoint system currently in development for the Next Generation Air Transportation System
(NextGen).

6. Other Interest Potential

The conceptualized action and alternatives may impact the following:

6.1. Recreational Areas: (Parks – federal, state, and local). Milhouse MOA would overlie
Roosevelt Creek National Park east of Carter County. The park offers picnicking, camping,
hiking, fishing, and horseback trails. Wing leadership has briefed local park staff about the
concept and informally assessed impacts to the natural soundscape. The unit has an excellent
relationship with the Chief Ranger and the Superintendent and will work further together to
refine local procedures to minimize impacts to specific areas of the park. There are no concerns
for the airspace under the proposed Crowe 2 MOA.

6.2. Native American Reservations, Lands, or areas of special interest. After discussion with
public affairs and informal contact with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, there have been none
identified for either the Sideshow or Crowe MOAs.

6.3. Grazing and/or farming. The majority of the area under the conceptual airspace is rural;
land used predominantly in forestry, and farming operations. With a significant lowering of the
lower altitude of the airspace, an impact is expected for these land uses. The wing plans on
balancing this impact by activating the Sideshow MOA no more than four hours per day. There
are no grazing or farming operations under the Crowe 2 MOA.

6.4. Endangered species. The following endangered species are listed for the counties
underlying the conceptual airspace: Indigo Bat, Running Buffalo Clover, and Emerald
Dragonfly. The following species are listed as threatened in the vicinity of the Sideshow MOA:
Niagara Darter and Springfield Sneezeweed. There are no associated species under Crowe 2
MOA.

6.5. Wildlife refuges. The Reagan Wildlife Refuge lies just under the southeast portion of the
Sideshow MOA. After initial informal discussions with state and federal representatives, there
appears to be little or no impact. There are no impacts with the Crowe 2 MOA.

6.6. Hunting and fishing. The majority of south central Johnson County offers excellent
hunting and fishing opportunities, which is located under the current Milhouse MOA. No major
impoundments are affected by the concept airspace; major waterways include the Ford River and
Kennedy Creek. There are small ponds associated under the Crowe 2 MOA.

6.7. Archaeological sites. None identified for either concept.

6.8. Population centers, communities, previously identified or potential noise sensitive
areas. The towns of Truman and Kennedy all border the conceptual Milhouse MOA to the west
and should only experience minimal noise intrusion. There are minimal population centers
under the Crowe 2 MOA.
 66                                                              AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


6.9. Ongoing litigation that may be impacted. Per coordination with the wing legal office,
there have been none identified for either concept.

6.10. Other training airspace actions that may be impacted by this initiative. After meeting
with the AFREP, the wing is not aware of any other initiative in the area that will be impacted.
As there is no other initiative to create additional LOWAT airspace this is the only course of
action.

6.11. Regional Actions by other MAJCOM or Military Services. After briefing this concept
at the Western Pacific Airspace and Range Council Meeting, there are no other duplicative
actions ongoing, nor any other current airspace that will meet these requirements.

6.12. Consultation with other state/federal agencies. As mentioned previously, various
components of this concept have been briefed to FAA Air Traffic Control Management
personnel, union representatives, and the AFREP in Springfield, NA. Initial, informal feedback
was very positive from each of these agencies.

6.13. Other Aviation interest groups and agencies such as: Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association (AOPA), National Business Aircraft Association (NBAA), Air Transport
Association (ATA), State Department of Transportation and any local airport commission
or Fixed Base Operators (FBO). After informal discussions with local transportation officials,
there will be little impact to the general aviation community. The wing MACA program
identified four FBOs whom could potentially be impacted and the wing has contacted two, with
plans to meet with the other two in the next four months during normal MACA visits.

6.14. Other interested or affected parties. None identified.

 GENERAL GUIDANCE ON MANAGING ENERGY DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS ON
                     AIR FORCE OPERATIONS

A15.1. Purpose. Air Force installations and operating space are valuable national resources and
we must preserve them in order to successfully accomplish our mission. Development of
domestic energy sources is a high priority for the country and for the Air Force, however there
are situations where striving to meet national energy goals may result in activities that negatively
impact the Air Force‘s operational, testing, and training missions. This general guidance is
designed to help installations and MAJCOMs more proactively understand, assess, and react to
potential mission impacts that might occur from energy-related development. It also provides
process diagrams and a sample coordination template to assist stakeholders, including
Commanders, MAJCOM A3 Airspace, Range and Operational Mission Management, and
Installation and Mission Support personnel in preparing and coordinating a proposal response.
A15.2. The Challenge. The current means for siting alternative energy development in the
United States create challenges for both the proponent and the Department of Defense. The lack
of a single, defined process has the developer seeking out multiple agencies to identify and
mitigate any predicted negative impacts from a proposal. Meanwhile, the AF and DOD have no
assured visibility on projects that may adversely impact military missions. Consequently, late
engagement has often resulted in contentious and sub-optimal outcomes for both parties. The
American Wind Energy Association‘s (AWEA) Siting Handbook lists eleven relevant statutes
governing project development, such as the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered
Species Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and Clean Water Act along with the Federal Aviation
Administration‘s (FAA) Obstruction Evaluation process. While DOD has a voice in some of
these arenas, it has no direct authority over development of projects off of DOD-controlled land.
In most cases, when an impact is found, the Air Force must ask another government agency to
exert authority to alter a proposal. When the Air Force reasonably anticipates mission
degradation, it must meet this challenge by actively engaging the developer and other authorities
with sound data and analysis. Anything less only serves to weaken the Air Force position.
A15.3. Mission Impact. There are many different types of development projects that can
adversely impact military missions. During the early planning process, identifying areas of
concern based on the entire envelope of characteristics is appropriate. Evaluating each project
based on its specific characteristics and location is critical. Experience with project evaluation
has shown that some characteristics, which may be of concern in one location, are not of concern
in another. Simply identifying the characteristics of a project do not by themselves form a basis
for an objection. Identifying the empirical impact to the mission will determine which concerns
can justify opposition. In evaluating a project‘s impact on the mission, some characteristics to
consider, which have had supportable significant impact, include: electro-magnetic interference
to radar or frequency spectrum, lighting related to night operations, and obstructions causing
safety concerns to flight paths and airspace. Evaluating projects within these areas have been
most successful at identifying concerns early in the process. Other characteristics, which should
be included in long-term planning but do not normally result in supportable opposition, include:
reflections, structures underlying airspace not causing safety concerns, and minor spectrum
interference. Additionally, objections based on concern for precedent-setting or future
cumulative impacts without sufficient technical support have generally not been successful.
 82                                                                 AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


A15.4. Planning. Current DOD policy calls for case-by-case reviews of energy development.
Each review is specific to the characteristics of the proposal and how it affects the unit‘s mission.
This practice should take into account other developments or the cumulative effects of adjacent
projects, but typically does not.
   A15.4.1. For effective management, airspace managers must be aware of a unit‘s operating
   space to determine which areas need elevated protection. Factors that should be included in
   this assessment are usage frequency, rarity or mission criticality of attributes, and usage type
   (testing, training, etc.) as well as current and proposed development affecting the space. Once
   a baseline of mission capabilities and requirements is established, the true impact to mission
   will become evident. This information will improve the ability of the unit to conduct case-by-
   case assessments by:
       A15.4.1.1. Identifying proposals that threaten high-priority operating space
       A15.4.1.2. Providing the necessary rationale for mitigation or formal objection
   A15.4.2. This is not an Operational, Environmental, Civil Engineering, or Base Community
   Planner‘s problem to solve alone. All stakeholders, including MAJCOMs, must become
   involved to truly realize the effects on the AF mission and to preserve Air Force operating
   space by planning wisely.
A15.5. Engagement
Installations should seek early notification of pending energy projects near AF installations
through the Installation Encroachment Management Team (IEMT,) RO/REOs, POCs at nearby
DOD installations, base Community Planners, local media sources, and off-base functions with
civic leaders. Once the installation discovers project development, they are encouraged to learn
more by calling the developer. Direct engagement with a developer is the best way to solve
issues early. Key points when contacting a developer:
   A15.5.1. Use a single point of contact even though the unit may have multiple Subject
   Matter Experts on the IEMT. Recommended team members include the base Community
   Planner, an Operations Officer, Mapping (GIS) POC, Base Judge Advocate, Safety,
   Environmental, a TERPS specialist and others as necessary.
   A15.5.2. Do not wait for official filing or notification. Engage as early as possible.
   Approach developers similar to local elected officials by laying out the concerns, preferably
   on maps they can keep, and guide them to where there is no or minimal impact.
   A15.5.3. A site visit to the local installation with tours of the flightline and mission briefings
   will educate developers about unit requirements. Experience shows this type of engagement
   provides the best opportunity to reach a mutually acceptable solution.
   A15.5.4. If a project has impacts on the unit‘s mission or operating space, explore possible
   mitigation options (moving turbines, decreasing heights, etc.) with the developer. Prior to
   negotiating mitigation agreements, coordinate efforts and official positions as outlined below.
A15.6. Proposal Response. There are several agencies with formal processes that an energy
developer must follow in order to proceed with a project. The Air Force has an opportunity to
review and comment on projects by participating in the official processes of the FAA, Bureau of
Land Management (BLM) and other federal, regional and local entities. These opportunities to
review do not cover all energy projects, such as those proposed on private- or state-owned land.
AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                                                                                        83


Even though the Air Force participates in these processes, often it is notified too late and is
unable to effect change. Therefore, the Air Force reaches out to engage developers early
whenever possible. Early discussions that occur while the developer still has site selection
flexibility offer the best opportunity for a mutually acceptable outcome. Also, because
sustaining Air Force missions involves a variety of stakeholders at all levels, communication is
necessary during all phases to avoid isolated, redundant or conflicting efforts and messages.
Appropriate communication allows for shared learning and problem-solving in defending and
articulating Air Force mission needs. Traditional methods of engaging solely at the unit level
without MAJCOM and/or Air Staff awareness may jeopardize mission sets outside of the local
unit‘s purview. The coordination process for obtaining an official Air Force position during
early engagement is shown in Figure 1. This process allows installations to engage with
developers beyond informal feedback and provide a coordinated official Air Force response
during the discussion and siting phases. It also shows decision points and approval authority.
Timelines outlined in Section 6.3 do not apply to this process if a preliminary (pre-filing)
assessment is requested.

  Figure A15.2: Process for receiving Air Force position under section 358
The following paragraphs provide additional background related to these official filing
processes.
A15.6.1. The OE/AAA process reviews any proposed structures over 199‘ tall for hazards to
air navigation. The FAA will consult the Services and others for inputs prior to deciding whether
or not to issue a Notice of Presumed Hazard (NPH). When a NPH is issued, the proponent has 60
days to respond before an FAA final determination is made. While the threshold of impact for an
NPH is relatively low, only impacts covered in Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part
77 will result in a final Determination of Hazard (DH). While the necessary justification for any
single determination is the sole purview of the FAA, recent history has shown that the only AF-
related impacts likely to result in a DH are:
            A15.6.1.1. Impacts to Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS)
            A15.6.1.2. Impacts to Long Range Radar
            A15.6.1.3. Obstruction within 10NM of an airfield
    A15.6.2. Even impacts listed above must be quantified and shown to present an
    unacceptable safety hazard. Note that military operations are not protected under Part 77.
    Any objection under the OE/AAA process should be based on hazard to air navigation.

A15.7. DoD/BLM Wind Energy Development Protocol. The 2008 wind energy development
protocol crafted by DoD and BLM calls for BLM to consult with the military services whenever
BLM receives a request for a permit for a right-of-way (ROW) to develop wind projects on BLM
land (previously identified as sensitive or critical by DoD). The consultation will be completed
prior to BLM approving the ROW.
   A15.7.1. The protocol defines the process and includes relevant timelines and points-of-
   contact. In short, the DoD Regional Environmental Coordinator (REC) is the Air Force lead
   for receiving the proposal and returning a response. The REC will consult the potentially
   affected Air Force Airspace Managers (or other Service equivalents) for impact reviews. The
   AF has three response options that align with the categories outlined in 6.4.5.
   A15.7.2. The response may have a combination of the three options, as some renewable
   energy technologies may have impacts that others would not. The response should be
   coordinated through the respective MAJCOM Encroachment Management Team. However,
   this coordination does not always take place. The local BLM office has the option to elevate
   an objection to their headquarters, which will engage DoD and AF headquarters. As detailed
   in the protocol, the local/MAJCOM response deadline is 45 days (with a 45 day extension
   upon request). The HQ review timeline is 30 days. Some key points on the protocol:
       A15.7.2.1. A negative AF response does not guarantee a denial of the ROW. BLM has
       full discretion.
       A15.7.2.2. A ROW application may be filed solely for meteorological (MET) towers,
       which are shorter anemometers, used to measure wind strength and consistency. AF
       policy is to assess the towers as wind turbines and give feedback accordingly. This is in
       recognition that the METs are likely to result in the development of a wind farm nearby.
       A15.7.2.3. The protocol currently covers only wind turbines. However OSD is engaging
       BLM to expand it to cover additional project types.
A15.8. Local Permitting Processes—Local jurisdictions with planning and zoning authority
may require special use permits for any type of energy development to ensure compatibility with
land use plans. These processes provide the Air Force an opportunity to raise concerns through
the traditional land use planning process. Some local land use permitting boards may even
require a developer to address military mission impacts prior to approving a permit
A15.9. State/Regional Energy Authorities and Regulatory Processes—Some states and
regions have developed renewable energy authorities or administer energy development
regulatory processes. The Air Force Regional Environmental Offices are familiar with such
offices and agencies and will be able to identify opportunities where the Air Force can engage
with them to ensure mission concerns are adequately considered.
A15.10. Encroachment evaluation coordination
Once the assessment of a proposal has been accomplished, appropriate coordination is necessary
as outlined in the above processes. Below is the information identifying the scope of information
necessary needed to respond as outlined in Section 6.4 and Section 6.5.
   A15.10.1. Installation Recommendation Determine which of the four responses best
   characterizes the proposed development. As outlined in above, proposals will be designated
   in one of four categories (See Section 6.4.5.) Note that category 3 and 4 findings are
 86                                                            AFI13-201 21 AUGUST 2012


   required to have the highest levels of signoff and should therefore have appropriate
   installation signoff.
   A15.10.2. Installation Assessment. Briefly explain rationale for the recommendation.
   Explain and quantify impacts to mission. Provide any additional supporting materials or
   outside evaluations which detail the impact. Include a summary of installation mitigation
   discussions with the developer (if any). See Section 6.5 for impact requirements for
   Category 3 and 4 findings.
   A15.10.3. Mitigations Considered. Briefly describe mitigation options considered and
   whether or not any are determined to be sufficient to resolve potential impacts. Reasonable
   options should be assessed, including but not limited to: modifications to flight routes,
   changes to or upgrades of existing hardware, and modifications to the proposed development.
   Modifications to the proposal must have the consent of the developer to be considered as a
   reasonable mitigation option. Unreasonable options should be considered as objections. See
   Section 6.6
   A15.10.4. MAJCOM Recommendation. Same as Installation Recommendation, but to be
   filled by MAJCOM. Category 1 and 2 recommendations and preliminary objections should
   be signed by MAJCOM-designated lead office. Final Objections should be signed by
   MAJCOM/A3
   A15.10.5. MAJCOM Assessment. Briefly explain rationale for concurrence or disagreement
   with the installation assessment. If relevant information or supporting material is known
   regarding Air Force authority (OE/AAA, federal land, local permitting) it should be included
   it with the assessment.
