      duty members and civilian employees of the Air Force will report all incidents of
      suspected family/partner maltreatment to the FAP, including unmarried intimates. An
      Unmarried intimate, as defined by the Department of Defense, is “a former spouse, a
      person of the opposite sex with whom the victim shares a child in common or a person
      with whom the victim shares or has shared a common domicile.” All military-related
      child care and medical providers will be trained regarding the indicators of child abuse
      and neglect, and the procedures for reporting family/partner maltreatment to the FAP.
      Exclusions are limited to chaplains receiving information through a “penitent-clergyman”
      relationship or confidential communications in the course of their official duties, and
      Area Defense Counsel (ADC) receiving information from an established attorney-client
      relationship.

      (PDI) on a continuous basis. All PDI will be passed on and proper notifications and
      recommendations will be made to the 509 MDG PRP office.
4. Prevention and Outreach
   4.1. The purpose of prevention is to enhance mission readiness by preventing the occurrence
   of child and spouse/partner maltreatment. The FAP takes responsibility for coordinating
   among on- and off-base agencies regarding prevention and outreach programs for the
   Whiteman AFB community through the wing’s Integrated Delivery System.

    4.2. Those portions of the USAF community that have a high probability of being the first,
    outside the affected family, to see indicators of family/partner maltreatment are defined as
    targeted populations. Whiteman AFB targeted populations require formal training on the
    recognition and reporting of incidents of family maltreatment.
