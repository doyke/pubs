This instruction was developed to familiarize you with Randolph AFB dormitory standards. Your
knowledge and compliance with these standards will make your stay with us pleasant and comfortable.
When you have many people living in one place, it is imperative to ensure a safe, healthy, and clean living
environment. Without you being well rested, and in good health, the mission of Randolph AFB doesn’t get
done. In the event some questions or situations arise that are not addressed by this instruction, please bring
them to the attention of the appropriate dorm manager or the first sergeant. We are committed to uphold
these standards equally among all residents. Any complaints of unequal treatment must be immediately
referred to your first sergeant or commander. This instruction is to be posted in your dormitory room.

This instruction defines Air Force, dormitory manager, and occupant responsibilities during occupancy of
military unaccompanied housing.

                                               AIR FORCE RESPONSIBILITIES

The Air Force will provide maintenance and repair, refuse collection and disposal, pest control, and fire and police
protection for your assigned unaccompanied housing (UH).

1.1. Initial Inspections. A dormitory manager will show you your room where you will conduct a joint inspection
when quarters are assigned. At this time, we will identify all current discrepancies and document them on AF Form
228, Quarters Condition Inspection Report. Every attempt will be made to correct discrepancies prior to assigning
the room.

1.2. Maintenance and Repair.       The Base Civil Engineer (BCE) has primary responsibility for performing
maintenance to your room and dormitory. Minor maintenance may be performed by the resident after consulting the
dorm manager. Requests for maintenance are made to the dorm manager Monday through Friday, 0730 -1630:
Nights, Weekends, and Holidays: Contact the Base Civil Engineer at 652-3151.

1.2.1. Work Order Response Time.

    Emergency work orders are responded to as soon as possible and work is continued until the emergency is
     resolved. Some examples are: A structural, utility, or mechanical problem that could cause loss of life or
     property or serious damage affecting health, safety, security, or mission. These could also be complete utility
     failure (electricity, gas, heat, water, sewage, or air-conditioning).

    Urgent work orders are completed within 5 work days. Completion date may be longer pending requisitioning
     of materials. Maintenance will normally be performed from 0730-1630. An example of an urgent work order
     is: Backed-up commode when there is another commode available.

    Routine work orders are completed within 9 days. Completion date may be longer pending requisitioning of
     materials. Maintenance will normally be performed from 0730-1630. Some examples are: Minor faucet leaks,
     repair wall locker doors or shelving, repair interior walls, or repair any appearance item.

1.3. Refuse Collection and Disposal. Place your room trash and garbage in the dumpsters provided. Exterior
garbage cans are provided and are used for minor trash or litter, not room trash. Your personal dayroom garbage is
to be taken to the dumpster, or thrown out with your room trash. Do not place trash on balconies or stairwells.
Personal room trash found in dayroom trash cans will be returned to the owner. Base Civil Engineer will dispose of
dead animals found on base. Call 652-2033 to report dead animals.

1.4. Insect Control. Texas has a tropical climate and, therefore, its share of insects. If needed, we will treat your
room before you move in; however, we do expect you to take preventive action to control insects. For example, keep
food in sealed plastic containers, remove trash and garbage from your quarters daily and discard empty paper bags
and boxes as quickly as possible. These items provide nesting and breeding areas for roaches. Call your dormitory
manager if infestation occurs that is beyond your control.

1.5. Lockouts. Your dormitory manager keeps a master key to all rooms. If locked out, contact him/her in person
during duty hours, 0630-1530, (see Atch 1 for phone numbers); if after duty hours or on weekends, call the number
posted on the dormitory manager’s office. We will replace lost keys when approved by the Housing Flight.

1.6. Ground Care. As a dormitory resident, you may be responsible for mowing or edging as a detail of bay
orderly. The base will normally maintain common areas. You're responsible for keeping the grounds around your
facility clean, and your dormitory manager may require additional grounds care.

1.7. Appliances. Ranges, refrigerators, and dishwashers, if installed, are government-furnished and serviced. They
are assigned by serial number and verified at check-in and termination inspections. Any problems, notify your
dormitory manager immediately.

1.8. Bay Orderlies. Each unit with people assigned to the dormitories must complete a fair share of Bay Orderly
duties based on the number of people living in the dorms unless prohibited by regulation. Units experiencing
extreme hardship from under manning or extensive TDY commitments may request a temporary waiver from the 12
SPTG/CC.


                                                   CHAPTER 2

                                     OCCUPANT RESPONSIBILITY
                                 DORMITORY STANDARDS AND POLICIES

RANDOLPHAFBI32-101                 1 Nov 1997                                                                     5

2.2. Cleanliness. Dormitories will be maintained within Air Force standards as outlined in AFI 32-6005 and this
instruction.

2.3. Inspections. The Wing Commander, Unit Commanders, First Sergeants, and designated personnel inspect
government dormitories to evaluate living conditions. Dignitaries visit the dormitories from time to time because
dormitories are an important Air Force quality of life issue. Render all appropriate customs and courtesies when
these officials enter your room. Commanders and First Sergeants have the right for no-notice inspections. Each unit
will inspect monthly for health, safety, and general cleanliness using the A, B, C method, and initially inspects rooms
using the checklist at Attachment # 4. All rooms rated “A”, Excellent, are normally not inspected for a period of
one month. Rooms receiving a “B” rating, Satisfactory, are inspected weekly, and rooms receiving a “C” rating,
Unsatisfactory, are inspected daily until it is brought up to a minimum “B” standard. Discrepancy notices are issued
when standards are not met.        The following provides a more detailed breakdown of cleanliness standards.
Remember your dormitory is an extension of your room.

   Wall Lockers.     Unlocked lockers are subject to inspection; arrange items neatly.

   Floors. Clean and vacuum weekly. Ensure there is no dirt build-up in the corners, behind the doors, or under
    beds or other furniture.

   Carpets. Any damage caused by misuse, abuse, burns, etc. may be chargeable to occupant. Carpets should be
    vacuumed and shampooed when needed. See your dormitory manager to use a carpet shampoo machine.

   Walls. Must be clean and maintained in good repair. Use mild soap and warm water to keep walls clean. Do
    not apply adhesive-backed materials, wallpaper, or decals to walls or furnishings as these cause damage upon
    removal. Use nail or "J" type hangers only and remove them prior to termination. Make sure door stops are
    serviceable to prevent damage to walls. If there are holes or depressions in the walls, they must be repaired. If
    the holes are small (less than three inches), you may repair them yourself. Any holes larger than three inches
    must be reported to the Dorm Manager as soon as possible. It is the responsibility of the occupants to report any
    problems as soon as possible. Walls must be repaired and repainted as necessary, a minimum of one month
    prior to outprocessing. You may obtain paint and materials from your dormitory manager for normal wear and
    tear repair. Rooms painted in personalized colors or unusual patterns, must be repainted prior to one month
    from departure and cost of the paint is the occupant’s responsibility.

   Sink. Clean hair from drain. Clean fixtures so they are free of dirt, mildew/mold, and water spots. Report any
    leaks to your dorm manager immediately. Use spray cleaner to clean the inside and outside of the under-sink
    cabinet. Ensure that mirrors are clean.

   Refrigerators. Clean any spills on the inside. Clean interiors of refrigerators regularly with water and baking
    soda. Defrost the freezer once a month unless needed more frequently. Pay special attention to shelves; clean
    under, inside, outside, and behind the bottom drawer if so equipped. Wash off the metal strips on the inside of
    the door. Be sure that there is no food residue splattered on the inside. The seal around the edge of the door
    must be clean and without food particles or dust/dirt. Dust off the wire framework in the rear of the refrigerator
    to improve cooling and extend the life of the unit. Be sure you clean around and under the refrigerator. While
    defrosting the freezer, do not use a sharp instrument to chip away ice and frost when defrosting. This
    practice may puncture the coils, and make you liable for replacement.

   Toilet/Bathing Area. This entire area must be frequently cleaned due to the potential for bacteria growth.
    Clean the toilet inside and out with a disinfectant type cleaner at least weekly. Clean the shower tile, bath tub,
    and shower curtain, with a disinfectant type cleaner at least weekly. There should be no soap scum or other
    residue left on walls. The shower curtain must be clean without mold or mildew stains. If the stains will not
    come off, have the dorm manager get you a new one. Be sure the ceiling light is clean and operational. The

occupants prior to final inspection. This includes removing all personal items. NOTE: Room walls will be
repaired and painted prior to occupants vacating the premises.

2.9. Security. Secure all your high cost items when you are absent from the room. Bulky items such as televisions

middle of the streets, and normally halfway on sides and rear to neighboring buildings. Help keep your dormitory
clean and neat; if you see trash, please pick it up.

2.12. Kitchen. Maintaining the appliances, cabinets, and walls in the kitchen requires special attention.
Dormitories with kitchens will be cleaned after each use by the individual using the facility. Clean ovens and broiler
units regularly, as well as the top burners, to prevent a fire hazard. Use oven cleaner ONLY on the inside of the
oven, do not use cleaner on ovens that are self-cleaning. You are liable for any damage caused to the range. Do not
put grease in the garbage disposals as it will solidify in the pipes and cause stoppages. Avoid placing hot
utensils on counter tops as this can cause permanent damage. Clean walls at periodic intervals to prevent surface
grease buildup.

make repairs and bill you. The Housing Flight can fully explain your options to repair or replace damaged items, or
the methods of reimbursement to the government.

2.19. Repair/Replacement Costs. The costs vary, depending upon circumstances encountered.

2.20. Energy Conservation. We need your assistance in conserving energy. Fewer dollars and rising utility costs
require us to do everything possible to conserve. Keep exterior doors closed during heating and cooling period to
conserve energy. Do not prop entry doors open because of the added strain to HVAC units and the humidity drawn
into the building.

2.20.1. Water. You may use normal and reasonable amounts of water, however don’t be wasteful. Excessive use
results in increase costs and depletion of the source of supply.

2.20.2. Heating and Cooling. Recommended temperature settings are as follows: heat 68F, air conditioning
78F. Conservation efforts result in large monetary and heating fuel savings without jeopardizing the health of any
individual. DO YOUR PART TO CONSERVE ENERGY.

2.20.3. Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems. There are different types of systems used in the
dormitories. All use hot or cold water in a closed loop for either winter heating or summer cooling. You must inspect
your room filter for cleanliness on a monthly basis. If you block the HVAC vents with a dirty filter, furniture, boxes
or other items, air flow is cut off and mold and mildew start to grow. If you have moisture on the HVAC outlets or
on the windows during the cooling season, raise your thermostat setting a few degrees to help eliminate the problem.
You must keep all windows and doors closed because the HVAC system will not operate properly.

2.20.4. Electricity. An organized effort must be expended to conserve electricity by eliminating unnecessary use.
You can help by minimizing the use of all electrical appliances and lights, especially during the peak demand periods
of 0900 to 1130 and 1400 to 1900. Do not leave television or radios on unattended. When you leave your room,
unplug irons and turn off all appliances, room lights, and ceiling fans.

2.20.5. Laundry Facilities. Wash full loads to conserve energy. Do not over-load machines. Overloading causes
damage to the machine. Never place plastic articles or pens in dryers. Clean the dryer lint screen before starting the
dryer. The machines are maintained by a CE contract. Contact dormitory manager for any problem. Do not leave
laundry unattended. Laundry left more than 24 hours is collected by the dorm manager, held for 7 days then
disposed of.

2.21. Environment. Several reminders: trash, engine oils, engine coolants, car grease, and other similar products
must NOT be poured into plumbing, drainage system or on the ground. Automotive tires and batteries are to be
properly disposed of through recycling programs.

2.22. Smoking. Smoking in bed is absolutely prohibited. Any smoking material will be thoroughly soaked with
water before being discarded. Smoking is not allowed in common areas to include: dayrooms, hallways, stairwells,
and bathrooms. Smoking is not permitted in adjoining bathrooms.

2.23. Drinking. Legal age for drinking is 21. If you are under 21, you will NOT drink or have alcoholic beverages
in your room. NO EXCEPTIONS ---- IT’S STATE LAW!

2.24. Bicycles. Bicycles may be kept in rooms provided the carpet under the bicycle is protected with a rug or mat
and lubrication of the bicycle is not done in the room. They may be locked up at the bike racks or lockers provided
at each dormitory. Bicycles will not be stored under staircases, on walkway balconies, or chained to railings.
Abandoned bicycles will be tagged, picked up by security forces and later turned into the Defense Reutilization
Management Office. You must provide your dorm manager the make, model and serial number of your bicycle.

2.25. Vehicles. Repairs of vehicles are not authorized in the dormitory areas or parking lots. Vehicle work shall be
done in the Auto Hobby Shop. Authorized minor work consists of: Cleaning or waxing, and air filter changes. No
cleaning or washing of vehicles will be done on sidewalks, grass, or seeded areas. Auto parts of any kind will not be

                                                     CHAPTER 4

                                                SECURITY FORCES

The installation commander is responsible for the control and safeguarding of all base property. Patrolling of the

                                                   CHAPTER 5

                                              GOOD NEIGHBORS

5.1. Occupant Courtesy. It is not easy for 100 or more people from different walks of life to live together in close
quarters. Courtesy goes a long way in helping reduce tension among dorm residents.
5.2. Quiet Time. The following quiet time will be observed throughout the dormitory area. Sunday through
Thursday, 2200-0600; Weekends and Holidays, 2200-0900. However, with shift workers living in all dormitories,
modified quiet hours are 24 hours a day. If stereo or other noise can be heard outside the room or through the walls,
it’s too loud. Excessive noise is the primary complaint received by security forces. Many Air Force personnel work
shifts and are sleeping during the day. Please be considerate. Don't assume your neighbors enjoy the same type of
music or television programs you do. Please keep the volume down, excessive stereo and television volume is very
disruptive.

into consideration other dorm residents may be asleep. Please clean up after yourself. Do not rearrange dayroom
furniture unless you intend to put it back. Do not remove dayroom furniture from the dayrooms. Dispose of your
trash properly. Please keep the noise down to a level that will not disturb those around you or the other residents.

emitting from the vehicle which would disturb or be a nuisance to other residents.


                                                   CHAPTER 6

                                     SPECIAL CLIMATIC CONDITIONS

6.1 Humidity. This condition is a fact of life at Randolph AFB. The following is a list of some actions you can
take to help eliminate mold and mildew problems in your dormitory and room. Keep your windows and doors closed
when using your air conditioner/heater. The mixture of hot and cold air is what causes air conditioner problems as
well as mold and mildew on walls and ceiling, and your furniture. When on leave or TDY, keep your thermostat set
at 72 degrees at all times; Summer or Winter. When you go on leave or TDY, inform your dormitory manager so a
weekly check of your room can be made for either maintenance or mildew. Replace your HVAC system air filter
monthly. See your dormitory manager for filters and replacement instructions. Keep furniture 18” away from wall
mounted air conditioning/heating units. For overhead units--no obstructions within 2 feet. When taking a shower,
close the bathroom door to reduce the moisture in your room, you may need to leave the vent fan on for a few
minutes to remove the steam and excess humidity. This is one of the major causes of mildew. Keep all dayroom,
hallway, laundry room, and foyer doors closed at all times. If you are passing by and a door is open, close it.


                                                   CHAPTER 7

                                        RANDOLPH SPECIFIC TOPICS

7.1. Solicitation In Dormitory Housing. All forms of solicitation are prohibited in the dormitories. Report
solicitors to the Law Enforcement Desk, 652-5700 immediately.

7.2. Waterbeds. Waterbeds are authorized in rooms only with a current Renters Insurance policy. Check with your
dormitory manager prior to putting one in your room. Any damage caused by waterbeds will be considered occupant
abuse.
12                                                                  RANDOLPHAFBI32-101                 1 Nov 1997


7.3. Telephones. Dormitory common area phones are maintained by the 12th Communications Squadron.
Dormitory room phones can be obtained at your own cost through Southwestern Bell at 1-800-464-7928.

7.4. Cable Television. Cable television can be obtained by calling Paragon Cable at 244-0500. All costs are your
responsibility. Splicing or tapping into another rooms cable is illegal!


                                                   CHAPTER 8

                                               SELF-HELP WORK

8.1. Requesting Self-Help Work. Self-help work in military dormitories must be relatively simple and is designed
primarily for occupant benefit. Normally, a self-help project is to improve living conditions. Self-help work must
not generate additional maintenance or repair costs. All self-help work requires completion of an AF Form 332, a
Base Civil Engineer Work Request, coordination as directed by the dormitory manager. No work will be
accomplished until this procedure has been followed and approval received.

8.2. Antennas. CB, SW and TV antennas will not be installed on dormitory buildings. Upon request, Digital
Satellite Systems (DSS) may be used providing the satellite dish is mounted on a portable base. The resident may
use his DSS when watching television and return the dish inside his room when finished using the system.

8.3. Painting Interior Walls. This requires an approval before accomplishing. Your dormitory manager will
inspect before and after painting. While government furnished paint is available, any other color is at occupant’s
expense. The room must be returned to proper colors and condition prior to terminating the room.

8.4. Standards And Specifications. The standard for each authorized self-help work; i.e., antennas, etc., is
available at the Housing Office. Periodic inspections must be accomplished while work is in progress. Inspections
can be scheduled by contacting the Housing Office, 652-4102. NO ELECTRICAL WIRING WILL BE DONE
EXCEPT BY A CERTIFIED ELECTRICIAN.

8.5. Disposition Of Improvements. Self-help improvements may be donated by the occupant and accepted by the
Air Force when workmanship and aesthetics meet acceptable construction standards. When removal is required,
your area must be restored to its original configuration.

at your next location.

9.1.2. Final Clearance. If you need a substitute to stand final inspection, notify the Unaccompanied Housing
Manager in advance and necessary forms and guidance will be given. NOTE: THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR
FINAL CLEARANCE OF UNACCOMPANIED HOUSING RESTS SOLELY WITH THE OCCUPANT.

9.2. Final Inspection. The occupant is responsible for accomplishing cleaning tasks as directed by the housing
representative prior to turning the quarters over to the Housing Flight. If you fail your final inspection, you should
contact your Dormitory Manager and schedule another inspection as soon as possible. (See Chapter 2)

                                           CRIME PREVENTION TIPS

Courtesy of 12th Security Forces Squadron

BURGLARY

1. Upon moving into your government quarters, check all locks, window latches, and other easy entry points for
defects. If you wish, a member of the Crime Prevention Section will come to your quarters and conduct a complete
residential security survey for you. To schedule a survey, contact the Crime Prevention Section at 652-5600.

2. All personnel are encouraged to participate in “Operation Identification.” You can do this by contacting your
unit Crime Prevention Monitor, your Dormitory Manager, or the Unaccompanied Housing Office and signing out an
electric engraver. Engrave the letters "AF" and your social security number on all of your valuable property. If your
unit cannot provide you an engraver, you can also sign one out from the Law Enforcement Desk.

3. Get involved with your neighbors in watching out for one anothers property.

4. Secure all doors and windows before retiring at night or departing the area.

5. When leaving for a short time, don't announce your absence by leaving a note on the door for an expected visitor.
Burglars read too.

6. Never put I.D. tags on your keys. If you leave your keys at a garage or valet parking lot, remove your house keys.

7. Don't leave a "hidden key" around your dormitory--the burglar will find it.

8. Do not give a room key to a “friend.” Remember, guests must be escorted.

9. Turn down the loudness of your telephone when gone so the unanswered phone can't be heard from the outside.

10. When leaving your residence for a few days while on leave or TDY, contact your First Sergeant or your
dormitory manager and have your quarters placed on the quarters checklist. Also have a friend watch your residence
for you. Inform the post office to hold all mail and newspapers.

CAR THEFT

1. Over half of all stolen cars have the keys in the ignition--always remove them. Do not leave keys unattended, they
can easily be picked up and it does not take a thief long to locate your vehicle.

2. Most stolen cars are unlocked--always lock up. Don't hide spare keys in your car.

3. Never leave the engine running, even for a few minutes while in a friend's driveway, or for a quick trip into a
store.

4. Motorcycles should be chained to an object to be considered secure as well as lock the steering column.

LARCENY

1. Don't leave tempting articles, such as CB radios and radar detectors, in plain sight in an unattended vehicle.
These are major targets for thieves. Mark these and secure them in your trunk or take them inside your quarters at
night. Remember, your CB antenna will mark your car for possible theft; if possible secure it in the trunk or inside
your quarters.
16                                                                  RANDOLPHAFBI32-101                 1 Nov 1997

2. Remember to secure your bicycle to a fixed object with a lock and chain when not in use. You may store your
bicycle in your room. Do not secure your bicycle to 1st, 2nd or 3rd floor railings. If you do, you have just created a
safety hazard. Secure your vehicles when you park them and remove all valuables from view by placing them in a
locked compartment or the trunk. Bicycles should be registered through the Security Forces Crime Prevention
Section at 652-5600.

3. Mark all property which is of high value or easy to remove from your room.


REPORTING A CRIME

1. Report all crime or suspicious activities immediately to Security Forces by calling one of the numbers listed
below. If you wish, you need not identify yourself. All information will be held in the strictest confidence.

2. Ensure you obtain as much information about an incident and the suspect as possible and report it to the Desk
Sergeant.

3. Reporting Numbers:                      EMERGENCIES: 911
                                           ROUTINE: 652-5700

The 12th Security Forces Squadron hopes your assignment at Randolph AFB is a pleasant one and any time you feel
our assistance is necessary, feel free to call. We're here 24 hours a day to serve you!

                             DORMITORY ROOM OF THE MONTH PROGRAM

1. In an effort to instill pride of ownership and to ultimately make your dormitories the best they can be, your dorm
council, commanders, first sergeants and dorm managers have developed the Room of the Month program. We feel
that friendly competition and the increased visibility of the truly outstanding rooms will improve the overall
condition of the dormitories.

2. Program is outlined as follows:

        2.1. Each dormitory, (861, 863, 977), will have a monthly winner as long as one room from each dorm has
been submitted for competition. Competition is only within the same dormitory ie, dorm 861 does not compete with
dorm 977.

       2.2. Rooms will be nominated by Unit Commanders/First Sergeants to the respective dorm manager NLT
COB on the 7th calendar day of each month. Each unit may submit one room for competition per month.

      2.3. Rooms submitted for competition will be judged by a panel composed of the 12 FTW/SEA, one Unit
Commander, one First Sergeant, one 12 CES/CEH representative, and one winner from the preceding month.

         2.4. Rooms will be judged and rated in three categories:

Cleanliness, Using room inspection checklist from the Dorm Guide

Upkeep, Have all necessary workorders been identified and reported?

Creativity, Does the room have character, does it feel like home?

         2.5. Rooms will be inspected and judged NLT the 14th calendar day of each month and the winners will
receive written recognition from the 12 FTW/CCC, Honorable mention in the Wingspread Housing Corner, as well
as other benefits prescribed by the member’s unit.

3. Ownership of this program belongs to the 12 CES Housing Flight, however administration of the program will be
conducted by the Unit First Sergeants and Commanders.

4. Any suggestions to improve this program may be submitted to your First Sergeant, Dormitory Manager, or the
Dormitory Council for consideration and possible implementation.
