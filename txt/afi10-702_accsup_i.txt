                                           Chapter 1

                                           GENERAL

1.1. Mission
     1.1.1. In general, MISO seeks to induce, influence, or reinforce the perceptions, attitudes,
     reasoning, and behavior of individuals, foreign leaders, groups, and organizations in a
     manner advantageous to US forces and objectives. Focused on the human dimension of the
     battlespace, AF MISO plans operations that leverage Air Force core competencies.
     Additionally, AF MISO takes advantage of the United States’ ability to synchronize kinetic
     and non-kinetic capabilities in the domains of air, space, and cyberspace to affect the
     perceptions, decision cycles, and actions of foreign states and/or actors. Air Force MISO
     planners will augment the Joint Informaiton Support Task Force (Special Operations) (JISTF
     (SO)) and other Joint IO functions with MISO-trained AF personnel. While Public Affairs
     (PA) forces communicate accurate and timely information to both domestic and international
     audiences regarding US and allied/coalition military operations, Air Force MISO forces plan
     and execute operations which exclusively target foreign audiences. Air Force MISO forces
     support US objectives through a variety of planned psychological effects-based operations,
     emphasizing cognitive domain target development, selection and engagement. The
     Component Numbered Air Force (C-NAF) staff and assigned Air and Space Operations
     Center (AOC) Information Operations Team plans objectives and tasks that employ MISO
     capabilities to achieve assigned Combatant Command (COCOM) and Combined Force Air
     Component Commander (CFACC) objectives.
        1.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) According to JP 3-13.2, MISO are ―planned operations to
        convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their
        emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign
        governments, organizations, groups, and individuals in a manner favorable to the
        originator’s objectives.‖
        1.1.1.2. (Added-ACC) In addition to planning and executing operations, MISO forces
        also assess those operations.
        1.1.1.3. (Added-ACC) The AFFOR A5 is the primary staff advisor to the COMAFFOR
        for contingency and crisis action planning to include the development of a Force
        Flow/time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD), and Service branch and sequel
        plans. The AOC provides operational-level command and control (C2) of air and space
        forces as the focal point for planning, directing, and assessing air and space operations.
        Both the AFFOR and the AOC will consider MISO during all planning, directing, and
        assessing of operations.
        1.1.1.4. (Added-ACC) Within ACC, MISO personnel in the AFFOR (or in the AOC,
        but working closely with the AFFOR), should help the AFFOR staff develop long-term
        objectives and tasks for all operations, especially those in phase 0, 1, 4 and 5.
     1.1.2. Military Information Support Operations are normally conducted in a joint/combined
     environment. Air Force MISO forces provide direct support to the combatant commander
     with message distribution and dissemination, direct participation in the target audience
     analysis (TAA) process, and can serve as a liaison between the AOC and other MISO entities
AFI10-702_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                              5


   such as the JISTF (SO). Additionally, Air Force MISO forces provide direct support to the
   component commander through the systematic use of air, space, and information operations
   to shape, condition, and exploit the psychological content of the battlespace. Air Force
   MISO capabilities must be integrated into the joint campaign from the start for deconfliction
   and for maximum effectiveness.
      1.1.2.1. (Added-ACC) Although AF MISO capabilities have historically been thought
      of in terms of Commando Solo, leaflet drops, and show of force, all Air Force assets and
      capabilities should be considered when planning to help produce desired objectives and
      effects. Both AFFOR and AOC MISO representatives should consider, coordinate,
      deconflict, and synchronize the use of these assets and capabilities with all other planning
      considerations as early in AFFOR and AOC processes as possible.
      1.1.2.2. (Added-ACC) ACC MISO personnel should ensure early involvement in all
      planning efforts, regardless of the phase of operation or organization (AFFOR or AOC)
      doing the planning.
      1.1.2.3. (Added-ACC) ACC MISO personnel should either perform or directly support
      the person responsible for Fused Communication and/or Strategic Communication.
1.2. Influence Operations (IFO)
   1.2.1. AFDD 2-5 discusses the operational application of Influence Operations (IFO).
   Because AF MISO is one of the operational activities of IFO, it is critical to integrate and
   deconflict with all IFO activities.
      1.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) AFDD 2-5 has been renamed as AFDD 3-13, but the contents
      remain unchanged. Further, it is critical to integrate and deconflict with any other
      activities being planned by the AFFOR or AOC. This includes kinetic, non-kinetic,
      lethal, and non-lethal activities.
      1.2.1.2. (Added-ACC) MISO should be integrated, deconflicted and synchronized with
      all C-NAF activities and operations, not just IFO activities.
   1.2.2. As per AFDD 2-5, IFO is the integrated planning, employment, and assessment of
   military activities to achieve desired effects across the cognitive targeting domain in support
   of operational objectives. The operational activities associated with IFO are MISO, Military
   Deception (MILDEC), Public Affairs (PA) operations, Counterpropaganda (CP) operations,
   Operations Security (OPSEC), and Counterintelligence (CI) operations.                 Influence
   Operations effects should result in altered behaviors and/or changes in the adversary decision
   cycle, aligning them with the commander’s objectives while protecting the friendly decision
   cycle from adversary influence.
      1.2.2.1. (Added-ACC) AFDD 2-5 has been renamed as AFDD 3-13, but the contents
      remain unchanged.
      1.2.2.2. (Added-ACC) Although ―engagements‖ are not discussed in current IFO
      doctrine, the use of personnel to engage with appropriate target audiences should be
      considered during planning, execution, and assessment.
   1.2.3. Air Force MISO, as an IFO activity, is critically dependent upon intelligence support
   that identifies opportunities for influence, analyzes sources of access, and identifies friendly
   areas vulnerable to foreign influence. By analyzing foreign target audiences and adversary
 6                                                AFI10-702_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


     decision makers at all levels, intelligence support contributes to air, space, and information
     superiority and also provides operational feedback to assist in the assessment of MISO
     effectiveness. National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) personnel conduct
     behavioral influences analysis (BIA), a process critical to understanding foreign, friendly,
     neutral, and adversary target audiences. Within the AOC, intelligence support for MISO,
     such as BIA, is coordinated through the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
     Division.
        1.2.3.1. (Added-ACC) Likewise, the Air Force Targeting Center will serve as a source
        for targeting information, including BIA, in support of AFFOR and AOC planning and
        targeting efforts, including those related to MISO.
1.3. Objectives. Military Information Support Operations target foreign individuals, groups,
and organizations (including governments) in accordance with national political and military
objectives. A crucial part of all air, space, and Information Operations, MISO enables the
warfighter to
     1.3.1. Prepare, shape, and exploit the actual or potential battlespace cognitive domain for air,
     space, and cyberspace.
     1.3.2. Dissuade or deter foreign aggressors or other hostile actors from pursuing courses of
     action hostile to friendly forces and their objectives.
     1.3.3. Induce, influence, and/or reinforce foreign attitudes, perceptions, reasoning, and
     behavior that encourage the de-escalation and/or early cessation of armed conflict.
     1.3.4. Isolate hostile forces from their domestic or foreign base(s) of support, diminishing
     their will to wage war or continue armed resistance.
     1.3.5. Target the cognitive domain in order to exploit possible vulnerabilities and fault lines
     in a foreign population or hostile alliance, shaping the battlespace in a manner advantageous
     to US objectives.
     1.3.6. Influence the decision-making and command-and-control capabilities of a foreign
     adversary.
     1.3.7. Reduce the combat/terrorist risk to US/Allied combat forces.
     1.3.8. Influence neutral/local populace to support US objectives.
1.4. Spectrum of Conflict - Air Force MISO planning is conducted during all phases of
operations from the tactical to strategic level. It is continuously engaged in shaping the
environment in support of US and Allied strategic, operational, and tactical initiatives.
1.5. Planning and Execution
     1.5.1. Air Force MISO in support of joint operations is planned and executed in accordance
     with CJCSI 3110.05C, the CJCSM 3122 series, JP 3-53 and this document.
        1.5.1.1. (Added-ACC) JP 3-53 has been renamed as JP 3-13.2
     1.5.2. The C-NAF operations staff (A39 or equivalent) is the focal point for deliberate IO
     operational planning; the AOC’s IOT is the focal point for adaptive and crisis-action
     planning for Influence Operations. Both staff sections will include trained AF MISO
AFI10-702_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                         7


   planners who interface with all C-NAF staff, AOC divisions, Joint MISO elements, and
   COCOM IO cells ensuring integration and deconfliction with the operational plan.
      1.5.2.1. (Added-ACC) If there are not separate AF MISO planners in the AOC and
      AFFOR, either the AFFOR A3 or the AOC CC will submit a waiver letter through HQ
      ACC/A3I for approval by HQ AF/ A3Z-CI.
   1.5.3. Air Force MISO planners will augment joint forces and teams for MISO.
1.6. Training and Education Standards
   1.6.1. In the absence of Officer and Enlisted MISO Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC), Air
   Force MISO Capability Specialists are designated by Special Experience Identifiers (SEI).
      1.6.1.1. Officer MISO Capability Specialist (SEI 9Q) designation criteria and authorized
      AFSCs are specified in the Air Force Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD),
      available via the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) web site.
      1.6.1.2. Enlisted MISO Capability Specialist (SEI 236) designation criteria and
      authorized AFSCs are specified in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory
      (AFECD), available via the AFPC web site.
   1.6.2. Air Force MISO Officer and Senior Non-Commissioned Officer (SNCO)

   2.5.8. (Added-ACC) Analyze intelligence data post-operation to assess operations and
   activities
2.6. (Added-ACC) MISO Authorities: There are explicit authorities with respect to the
existence and employment of the U.S. MISO capability. The capability and the authorization to
execute MISO as influence activities in a theater of operations are established in a number of
legal and policy documents. These authorities serve to regulate and facilitate the accurate and
effective planning and execution of MISO that best achieve U.S. national and mission objectives.
The authorities that govern MISO should be viewed not as mechanisms to constrain their
employment, but rather as necessary national command level approval, interagency coordination,
and combatant command level endorsements for implementing MISO to the fullest extent. These
authorities ensure effective and professional transmission of informative and influential
messages by a trained, organized, and equipped MISO force to foreign audiences using high
visibility, often sensitive communications and interactions and prevent non-MISO personnel,
staffs, and organizations from launching ill-advised, untrained, ad hoc efforts that can result in
severe negative consequences for the United States, the supported commander, host and partner
nations, allies, and coalitions, or even the TA.
   2.6.1. (Added-ACC) Army Field Manual (FM) 3-05.30, Psychological Operations, outlines
   the various legal and policy considerations for MISO. MISO planners require a thorough
   understanding of the regulatory basis for how MISO are planned, approved, and executed in
   a theater of operations.
   2.6.2. (Added-ACC) Legal authorities are explicitly and purposefully worded with precise
   terms and definitions. MISO commanders, staffs, and planners should always consult the
   staff judge advocate to obtain the most current or new legal references, and for expert
   interpretations of them.
   2.6.3. (Added-ACC) Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff instructions (CJCSI) 3110.05E,
   Joint Psychological Operations Supplement to the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan, contains
   a list of preapproved programs that can be executed by the combatant commanders for
   SecDef approved missions, operations, and Unified Command Plan (UCP) directed activities.
   2.6.4. (Added-ACC) An approved MISO program is not an execution authority. It provides
   guidance for the planning and execution of MISO as influence activities, but execution is
   initiated by an execute order (EXORD), deployment order (DEPORD), or program approval
   that contains specified execution authorities. GCCs submit proposed MISO programs
   through the Joint Staff to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) for interagency
   coordination and ultimately, for Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (USD[P]) approval. A
   program contains the required USD(P) guidance for execution. All actions and messages are
   required to comply with, complement, and adhere to the stated parameters in the approved
   program.
   2.6.5. (Added-ACC) The requirement for approved MISO programs does not apply to Civil
   Authority Information Support (CAIS) missions; however, as MIS forces only provide
   information production, distribution, and dissemination capabilities to the appointed lead
   federal agency that agency is the approval authority for themes, messages, products, and
   execution.
AFI10-702_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                           19


     2.6.5.1. (Added-ACC) It is important for commanders and planners to understand the
     parameters within which federal government agencies, particularly the DOD, responds to
     domestic emergencies. CAIS consists solely of public information dissemination
     activities that support U.S. lead federal agency responses during disaster relief and crisis
     management operations within the United States and its territories. By law and policy,
     influence activities are prohibited during CAIS (Appendix A provide a discussion of The
     Smith-Mundt Act). When authorized for CAIS missions, MISO forces and equipment are
     employed to produce, distribute, and disseminate via audio, visual, and audiovisual
     means, public information that is developed, provided by, and attributed to the lead
     federal agency. The lead federal agency approves all dissemination activities prior to
     execution. MISO forces rely exclusively on the lead federal agency to provide specific
     informational messages.
     2.6.5.2. (Added-ACC) MISO forces conduct CAIS activities under the direction and
     guidance of the lead federal agency, and are not part of any MISO program. Authority
     over and control of U.S. military forces and capabilities are maintained by the President,
     as Commander in Chief, through the SecDef and the chain of command as established by
     law. When emergency conditions dictate, and when time does not permit approval from
     higher headquarters (HQ), local military commanders and responsible DOD-component
     officials are authorized to respond to requests from local authorities and to initiate
     immediate response actions to save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate great
     property damage under imminently serious conditions.
