“You are encouraged to resolve problems at the lowest possible level. Address
problems early, make sure you talk and listen, use your chain of command, and get
your commander involved when necessary. If more assistance is needed, additional
sources of help are listed below. Don’t be afraid to ask for help…or fear reprisal.”

DID YOU KNOW? Air Force military and civilian members have a duty to promptly report (1)
