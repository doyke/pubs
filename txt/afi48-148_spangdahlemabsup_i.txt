This instruction specifies the requirements for protection of USAF personnel and their
dependents from ionizing radiation. It also specifies requirements to protect the general public
from exposure to ionizing radiation resulting from USAF activities. It is a companion document
to AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force, AFI 91-108, Air Force
Nuclear Weapons Intrinsic Radiation and 91(b) Radioactive Material Safety Program and
AFMAN 48-125, The US Air Force Personnel Dosimetry Program. It implements DODI
6055.08, Occupational Radiation Protection Program, and AFPD 48-1, Aerospace Medicine
Program. It also implements the requirements of NATO Standardization Agreement 2473,
Commanders Guide to Radiation Exposures in Non-Article 5 Crisis Response Operations-ED 2,
for the protection of personnel from low-level radiation exposures. It defines responsibilities for
the protection, monitoring and medical follow-up of military personnel for the full spectrum of
military operations or military operations otherwise considered vital to the interests of national
security. This instruction applies to all active duty USAF members, members of the USAF
reserve and Air National Guard, USAF civilian personnel and personnel living on USAF
installations exposed or potentially exposed to ionizing radiation. This instruction directs

(SPANGDAHLEMAB) Air Force Instruction (AFI) 48-148, 12 October 2001, is
supplemented as follows: This publication and AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials
in the US Air Force, establish responsibilities, policies, and procedures to minimize occupational
and environmental exposures to ionizing radiation. This publication applies to all Air Force
(AF) military and civilian personnel working at Spangdahlem Air Base (AB), supported sites,
outside agencies and contractors bringing radioactive material (RAM) or devices on to
Spangdahlem AB, and contractors on Spangdahlem AB whose duties require work with sources
of ionizing radiation or work in areas where exposure to ionizing radiation may occur.
Requirements apply to each unit where RAMs or radiation producing devices are used, and to
each respective Unit Radiation Safety Officer (RSO). The contracting office will ensure that the
information in this publication is part of appropriate contract language when soliciting projects
for bid. This publication details the appointment and responsibilities of Unit, Permit, and
Installation RSOs; lists Spangdahlem AB-specific responsibilities of commanders and
organizations; provides special Spangdahlem AB requirements for permitting and control of
RAMs; provides the documentation requirements for radiation exposure incidents; and details
the radiation protection quality assurance program and management oversight activities
conducted by the Installation RSO. This publication implements the ―         as low as reasonably
achievable‖ (ALARA) concept for radiation protection as required by AFI 48-148. This
publication does not apply to exposure of patients during diagnostic or therapeutic medical
procedures. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363_USAFESUP, Management of Records, and
disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF 847s from the field through the
appropriate functional’s chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This interim change incorporates specific policy, instruction, and guidance on radiation safety
programs associated with current nuclear weapons maintenance operations, continental United
States (CONUS) legacy maintenance operations, other related nuclear weapons operations and
the management of other 91(b) material. Intrinsic radiation safety (INRAD) and the
management of mixed waste have been addressed. This change updates organizational
changes that have occurred since initial publication. Organizational office symbols are
updated. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.

                                           Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. This instruction provides specific policy, instruction and guidance for the
protection of USAF personnel and their dependents from sources of ionizing radiation. It also
specifies requirements to protect the general public from exposure to ionizing radiation resulting
from USAF activities. The instruction addresses an existing gap in regulating exposures
resulting from machine produced/naturally occurring radiation sources, deployed environments
and operations involving radioactive material covered by Section 91(b) of the Atomic Energy
Act (AEA) of 1954. Individuals reviewing this instruction, not familiar with radiation safety, are
advised to review Attachment 2, Quantities and Terms Used in Radiation Protection and
Attachment 3, Medical Consequences of Ionizing Radiation Exposure before proceeding.
1.2. Applicability. The requirements of this instruction are intended to protect Airmen and their
dependents, DOD civilians and members of the general public. As such, the radiation safety
program outlined in this regulation applies to all Air Force units and installations that:
   1.2.1. Possess or use radioactive materials as specified in AFI 40-201.
   1.2.2. Possess or use ionizing radiation producing devices.
   1.2.3. Are exposed to ionizing radiation during the full spectrum of military operations.
   1.2.4. Are nuclear capable units, have nuclear capable tenant organizations or are
   geographically separated nuclear capable units (GSUs) that engage in storage and
   maintenance of current nuclear weapons.
   1.2.5. Generate or dispose of radioactive waste and/or mixed (i.e., chemical and radioactive)
   waste. This includes the 91(b) material program elements such as management and disposal
   of legacy nuclear weapons maintenance wastes, management and disposal of residuals from
   nuclear weapons accidents, management and disposal of residuals from aircraft wash-down
   operations from atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, and management and disposal of
   residuals from nuclear reactor operations.
1.3. Objectives of the USAF Radiation Protection Program.
   1.3.1. Prevent the occurrence of clinically significant radiation induced deterministic effects
   (effects for which a threshold dose exists and whose severity is proportional to dose such as
   cataracts and acute skin effects) by adhering to dose limits.
   1.3.2. Limit the risk of stochastic effects (effects whose probability of occurrence is
   proportional to dose such as cancer and hereditary effects) to a reasonable level in relation to
   the requirements of the USAF mission, other societal or military risks, benefits gained and
   economic factors.
1.4. Practices and Interventions. Activities that may result in radiation exposure can be
broadly divided into two categories: practices and interventions (ICRP Publication 60, 1990
Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection). Routine and
controlled operations that incur radiation exposure as an unavoidable and unintentional aspect of
the activity are considered practices. This instruction considers all USAF activities that involve
8                                    AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 3 MARCH 2010


the routine use of radiation emitters or radioactive materials in medicine, research, industry and
training to be practices. Interventions encompass two broad types of activity, operations that seek
to reduce existing exposures that are not part of a controlled practice and activities conducted to
mitigate threats greater than that posed by radiation or otherwise conduct operations necessary to
achieve higher objectives, including those of national security. Note that the classification of an
action as either an intervention or practice is independent of whether the activity occurs in
peacetime, MOOTW or during war.
1.5. Types of Radiation Exposure. For the purposes of this instruction, four types of radiation
exposure are recognized as being received by USAF personnel or their dependents: occupational
exposures occurring as a result of individuals assigned duties, medical exposures received for the
diagnosis and treatment of disease, exposures of the general public (including dependents,
retirees, and other members of the general public), and exposures occurring from incidents,
accidents, and military operations in radiological environments.
    1.5.1. Occupational exposures are those routine exposures incurred as a necessary part of
    supporting the USAF mission that can reasonably be regarded as being the responsibility of
    USAF leadership. Common practices that may incur occupational exposures include, but are
    not limited to: industrial radiography, depleted uranium munitions handling, research
    involving nuclear materials or radiation producing devices, well-logging, diagnostic
    radiology, nuclear medicine, radiation therapy and activities involving maintenance of
    nuclear weapon systems. Further, occupational exposures also include exposures to elevated
    forms of naturally occurring radiation including operations in workplaces where radon
    exposure has been identified as significant and where cosmic or solar radiation is elevated
    during jet aircraft and space flight.
    1.5.2. Medical exposure is confined to exposures incurred by individuals as part of their own
    medical diagnosis and treatment. This does not include occupational exposure of medical
    staff, nor persons of the general public exposed to stray radiation from the diagnosis and
    treatment of other persons.
    1.5.3. Public exposure encompasses all exposures other than occupational and medical
    exposures. On average, the largest source of general public exposure is from naturally
    occurring sources of radiation, with the internal dose from radon progeny being the largest
    contributor.
    1.5.4. Incident or contingency-type exposures are those incurred by USAF personnel as a
    result of actions or activities not considered practices. These include specific emergency
    response activities to save life or property, humanitarian assistance operations, and military
    operations conducted where national interests may force personnel to incur radiation doses
    beyond occupational limits.
1.6. Radiation Protection Policy for Practices.
    1.6.1. Justification: No practice involving exposure to radiation shall be adopted unless there
    is sufficient benefit to the exposed individual or to achieving necessary military objectives to
    offset the harm it may cause.
    1.6.2. Optimization: The magnitude of individual doses and the number of people exposed
    shall be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA), economic, military and social
    factors being taken into account.
AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I                3 MARCH 2010                                      9


   1.6.3. Dose Limits: The dose to an individual resulting from a combination of all relevant
   practices shall not exceed specified dose limits.
1.7. Radiation Protection Policy for Interventions.
   1.7.1. Justification: A proposed intervention should do more good than harm, i.e., the action
   should be of sufficient value in terms of military objective to be achieved or humanitarian
   assistance to be rendered so as to justify the potential harm and costs.
   1.7.2. Optimization: The form, scale, and duration of the intervention should be optimized so
   the net benefit is maximized and the net detriment is minimized. Again, individual doses
   should be maintained as low as reasonably achievable.
   1.7.3. Dose Guidance: Dose limits do not apply for interventions. Instead, dose guidance is
   utilized to guide surveillance and protection of forces.

            RADIATION PROTECTION FOR OCCUPATIONAL PRACTICES

3.1. Introduction. Every organization or installation that uses non-exempt quantities of
radioactive material (RE: AFI 40-201)), uses devices that produce ionizing radiation (hereafter
referred to as radiation sources), store and maintain current nuclear weapons, manage and
dispose of legacy nuclear weapons maintenance wastes, manage and dispose of residuals from
nuclear weapons accidents, manage and dispose of residuals from aircraft wash-down operations
from atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, and manage and dispose of residuals from nuclear
reactor operations shall implement the radiation safety program outlined in this instruction that is
commensurate with the scope of the program and its potential health hazards. Critical elements
of this program are in the following sections of this chapter, and are generic to all USAF
practices involving potential exposure to ionizing radiation. Specific technical orders or
instructions should be referred to for additional detailed information on radiation protection for
specific practices (e.g. AFI 91-108 and T.O. 33B-1-1, Non-destructive Inspection).
3.1. (SPANGDAHLEMAB) 3. Quality Assurance. The Installation RSO will accomplish an
annual review of the base radiation protection program. Results will be presented at the 52 FW
Combined Safety Council/Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health Council meeting and
the 52 Medical Group (52 MDG) Aerospace Medicine Council meeting (if applicable).
     3.1.1. Radiation Safety Organization.
        3.1.1.1. Installation RSO: The wing or installation commander shall appoint an
        Installation RSO in writing. The individual will be responsible for the overall
        coordination of base radiation safety activities, and provide direct support to the
        installation commander on radiation safety issues.
        3.1.1.2. Unit or Organization RSO. When an organization’s practices can potentially
        result in radiation exposure at or above ten percent of the annual occupational dose limits
        specified in Table A4.1, unit/workplace RSOs shall be appointed in writing by the unit or
        organization commander. Workplaces normally requiring RSO appointment include
        medical x-ray, non- destructive inspection, research facilities using machine produced
        radiation sources, and potentially some high altitude/long duration flight operations. In
        addition, nuclear capable units and units with 91(b) material will appoint unit RSOs.
        This individual shall be directly responsible to the senior management of the
        organization, be properly resourced to execute the requirements of the radiation safety
        program and have ready access to all levels of the organization that may use radiation
        sources.
        3.1.1.3. Radiation Safety Committee. Facilities, organizations or installations with
        extensive radiation protection program requirements shall establish a radiation safety
        committee (RSC) composed of senior management, the installation RSO, organization or
        unit RSO and other individuals knowledgeable and responsible for radioactive material
        and radiation producing devices. Examples of extensive programs would include large
        medical facilities and research organizations to which a health physicist or dual-qualified
        bioenvironmental engineer is assigned. Generally, organizations with large programs
        using radioactive material will require an RSC as part of its USAF Radioactive Material
AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I               3 MARCH 2010                                      23


     Permit requirement. However, installations primarily using a number of machine-
     produced radiation sources, or that have a number of suborganizations using different
     radiation sources should consider formulating an RSC. The RSC shall meet at a
     frequency appropriate to evaluate the purpose, safety and compliance of the radiation
     safety program and regulatory requirements, with the exception that all RSCs established
     as a condition of an USAF RAM permit shall meet quarterly.
  3.1.2. Radiation Safety Program Policy, Instructions, Procedures and Manuals.
     3.1.2.1. Commanders, organization and unit RSOs, and workplace supervisors shall
     institute a radiation safety policy that defines the goals of the radiation safety program,
     the organization and administrative control required for use of radioactive materials and
     radiation producing devices, and state a commitment to the radiation protection policy for
     practices (see section 1.6).
     3.1.2.2. Commanders, organization and unit RSOs, and workplace supervisors shall
     ensure radiation safety procedures are incorporated into appropriate procedures or
     instructions. These procedures and instructions should describe the actions or steps
     necessary to safely conduct a particular task involving a radiation source and document
     performance of the task. Radiation safety procedures and instructions shall be clearly
     written, succinct, readily available to all users of radiation sources, annually reviewed
     and updated as necessary. The instruction(s) shall describe the safety controls and
     procedural safeguards necessary to limit exposure, and actions to be followed in the event
     of an emergency.
     3.1.2.3. Commanders of organizations requiring a RSC shall also ensure a radiation
     safety instruction is developed that includes: command or supervisor commitment to the
     radiation protection policy of section 1.6, a description of the RSC, the radiation safety
     staff and the radiation safety program, specific policy and regulatory requirements and
     specific procedures on how to comply with these requirements.
  3.1.3. Quality Assurance. Commanders, organization and unit RSOs, and workplace
  supervisors shall ensure a quality assurance program is established to oversee the radiation
  safety program (ref: NCRP Report 127, Operational Radiation Safety Program), as
  recommended by the installation RSO. The quality assurance program shall comply with all
  USAF directives and best industry practices (e.g. T.O. 33B-1-1, JCAHO, etc.). Elements that
  may be included in the quality assurance program include audits, inspections, surveillance
  and statistical evaluations, as appropriate, to evaluate the adequacy of:
     3.1.3.1. Basic control of radiation producing equipment and radioactive material,
     3.1.3.2. Conformance with organizational policies and regulatory requirements,

  factors, and identify corrective measures, as appropriate. Refer to AFI 48-125 for additional
  information.
  3.4.4. Exposure Control. Workers shall use the following techniques, as appropriate and
  under the judgment and discretion of the unit or organization RSO, to ensure dose limits are
  not exceeded and exposures are ALARA (ref: NCRP Report No. 127, Operational Radiation
  Safety Program).
     3.4.4.1. Time, Distance and Shielding: As appropriate, minimize the time around sources
     of external radiation, maximize the distance to radiation sources, and utilize radiation
     shielding between radiation sources and potential exposed personnel to control external
     radiation doses.
     3.4.4.2. Personal Protective Clothing:
         3.4.4.2.1. As appropriate, personal protective clothing including lead aprons, glasses
         and thyroid shields to protect from x-rays, plastic face shields and glasses to protect
         from beta particles, and clothing and gloves to protect from contamination shall be
         used to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the principles of ALARA and
         ORM.
         3.4.4.2.2. Use of personal protective clothing is not merited where its use may result
         in: overall more significant internal or external exposure to radiation or other health
         risks more severe than that posed by the potential radiation exposure.
         3.4.4.2.3. Respiratory protection use shall be IAW AFOSHSTD 48-137, Respiratory
         Protection Program.
     3.4.4.3. Contamination Control: In the absence of superceeding regulatory or advisory
     guidance, a surface is contaminated if either the removable or total radioactivity is above
     the levels in Table A4.2
         3.4.4.3.1. If a surface cannot be decontaminated promptly to levels below those in
         Table A4.2, the area should be controlled and marked as contaminated. Contact
         AFIERA/SDRH for additional guidance.
         3.4.4.3.2. Always reduce radioactive contamination to levels ALARA.
     3.4.4.4. Access Control and Alarm Systems: Provide access control and/or alarm systems
     to prevent access to or warn of a radiation hazard, as appropriate. Generally, such
     systems are appropriate for areas that can be classified as high or very high radiation
     areas under section 3.2.2 For additional information, consult AFIERA/SDR and refer to
     NCRP Report No. 88, Radiation Alarms and Access Control Systems.
     3.4.4.5. Radiation Safety Procedures and Work Permits: As appropriate: implement, use
     and periodically review radiation safety procedures and radiation work permits.
     3.4.4.6. Removal from or Change of Duty: Individuals who are likely to exceed the dose
     limits of Table A4.1, even with application of the above measures, shall have duties
     modified or curtailed so that annual limits are not exceeded. Such changes in duty shall
     remain in effect until the individual’s projected dose will be less than annual limits. This
     situation is most frequently encountered for the pregnant worker who has declared their
     pregnancy. Based on the exposure information and workplace assessment of the
28                                   AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 3 MARCH 2010


        Installation RSO, the female worker’s obstetrician (if military) or civilian health care
        provider (if civilian) will determine any restrictions to the worker’s duties involving
        occupational radiation exposure. The following guidelines are generally prudent for
        declared pregnant workers:
           3.4.4.6.1. Declared pregnant technologists or providers should be restricted from
           performing fluoroscopic and interventional procedures.
           3.4.4.6.2. Declared pregnant technologists can perform routine radiographic studies,
           portable examinations to include the operating room (except fluoroscopy, i.e. C-arm),
           computed tomography, mammography, and radiation therapy.
           3.4.4.6.3. Declared Pregnant Nuclear Medicine Technologists may work in imaging
           rooms, but should be restricted from dosing patients and working in the hot lab.
           3.4.4.6.4. Female nuclear weapons specialists (i.e., 2W2) who declare pregnancy per
           paragraph 2.19.9 should be restricted from duties requiring contact with or
           occupancy in rooms where tritium is present. If operation requirements of the unit
           make it necessary for pregnant females to work in areas where tritium is present, then
           the unit commander shall review the exposure potential. The unit commander should
           consult AFSC/SEWN, the installation RSO, and/or the worker’s Primary care
           Manager to discuss the potential for exposure and risk associated with such exposure.
3.5. Radiation Dosimetry, Reporting and Record Keeping.
     3.5.1. Personnel Monitoring Criteria. Eligible persons shall be entered into the USAF
     dosimetry program (see AFI 48-125) if any of the following apply:

        occupational dose received during the same year while employed by any other employer
        (ref 10 CFR 20.1201(f)).
        3.5.1.6. Personnel monitoring may be provided to individuals not meeting any of the
        above criteria as the discretion of the installation RSO, if the following apply:
           3.5.1.6.1. The type of radiation to which the individual could be exposed is
           detectable by the USAF personnel monitoring program;
           3.5.1.6.2. Provision of monitoring services would be helpful in demonstrating
           compliance with ALARA; or
AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I               3 MARCH 2010                                      29

               RADIATION PROTECTION FOR MEDICAL PRACTICES

4.1. Introduction. The use of radioactive materials and radiation-producing devices in USAF
medicine is the single largest source of man-made exposure to USAF personnel. This section
describes the requirements for radiation protection in medical practices to ensure patient,
practitioner and general public doses are ALARA, while still obtaining clinical objectives. This
section applies to all active USAF Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) worldwide that acquire,
possess, install, calibrate, maintain, evaluate, use or dispose of radiation sources used for
diagnosis, therapy or for medical research. Responsibility for complying with the requirements in
sections 4.4–4.14 rests with the facility commander or that individual so delegated by the
commander that has the appropriate training, skills, credentials, and resources to ensure
compliance.
4.2. Responsibilities.
   4.2.1. Radiologist, Radiation Oncologist, Nuclear Medicine Physician, and Physicians: The
   radiologist, radiation oncologist, nuclear medicine physician and other physicians working
   with radiation shall: control all aspects of the conduct and extent of examinations, ensure
   radiographic examinations, radiation therapies or nuclear medicine procedures are only
   performed by properly trained personnel with adequate knowledge of the physical properties
   and harmful effects of ionizing radiation and that the procedures used are appropriate and
   optimized for the clinical problem presented.
   4.2.2. Medical Physicists (Organizational and Regional). For nuclear medicine and
   diagnostic radiology: A medical or health physicist may be considered a qualified expert
   when they have had modality specific training and performed three surveys for a particular
   type of equipment under the supervision of a board certified medical physicist or a medical
   physicist who meets all the education, training and experience necessary to complete all
   aspects of ABR or ABMP board certification. For radiation therapy, a board certified
   radiation therapy physicist must supervise the medical physicist until all education, training
   and experience necessary to complete board certification is met. Organizational medical
   physicists shall be directly responsible to the organization to which they are assigned, and
   support those MTFs within their host organization’s geographic region (see Attachment 5
   for specified regions). Medical physicists shall:
       4.2.2.1. Oversee quality control practices for the MTF to which the physicist is assigned
       and provide review and guidance for quality control programs in departments utilizing
       ionizing radiation for imaging within the physicist's geographic region.
       4.2.2.2. Oversee training for junior health or medical physicists and supervise
       technologists who perform nuclear medicine and diagnostic radiology quality control and
       quality assurance functions.
       4.2.2.3. Provide or support medical physics consultant services necessary to support the
       requirements of the Mammography Quality Services Act, 21 CFR Parts 16 and 900.
       (Note: for mammography support, medical physicists must meet all qualifications of 21
       CFR Part 900.)

        4.2.2.6. Further, a qualified radiation therapy physicist shall provide services as listed in
        section 4.12.1
     4.2.3. Medical Equipment Repair Technicians: will support collection of data for entrance
     skin exposure IAW AFI 41-201, Managing Clinical Engineering Programs, and perform
     acceptance testing on diagnostic radiology equipment.
        4.2.3.1. Entrance skin exposure data must be collected annually for each diagnostic
        radiology unit including new equipment under warranty. Data must be provided to the
        installation RSO and to the MTF’s Chief of Radiology.
4.3. General.
     4.3.1. Qualifications to Prescribe the Use of Radiation in Medicine.
        4.3.1.1. The use of radiation or radioactive material for the purposes of diagnosis or
        treatment of disease or injury shall only be prescribed by Doctors of Medicine or
        Osteopathy who are licensed by the United States or one of its territories or possessions.
        Exceptions include properly trained nurse practitioners, physician assistants and persons
        in post-graduate training status under the supervision of a licensed Doctor. The Chief of
        Radiology may recommend to the Credentials Committee other healthcare providers
        (physical therapy, occupational therapy, orthopedics) be granted privileges for ordering
        radiographic exams, consistent with their training and abilities. The use of radioactive
        material for the purposes of diagnosis or treatment of disease or injury shall only be
        prescribed by authorized users listed on USAF Radioactive Material Permits.
        4.3.1.2. Doctors of Dental Surgery or Dental Medicine may request appropriate
        examinations of the head, neck and chest, although such requests are normally confined
        to the oral region. Podiatrists and Chiropractors may request x-ray examinations
        appropriate to their specialty.
        4.3.1.3. Variances to the above qualification requirements should occur only for
        emergency or life-threatening situations. Non-peacetime operations in the field could
        require variances from this policy.
        4.3.1.4. Any request for specialized radiography and fluoroscopy, such as angiography,
        computerized tomography or other complex studies should be made by providers
        credentialed by the MTF.
     4.3.2. Operator Qualifications.
        4.3.2.1. Physician Performance. Eligible physicians include radiologists and other
        physicians granted privileges in radiology on the basis of the needs of patients serviced
        by the facility. Such privileges might include the use of x-ray equipment by cardiologists
        for cardiac catheterizations and by dentists or podiatrists as part of their practice. Before
        physicians and dentists are granted radiology privileges they should have received
        adequate training in equipment use, radiation protection and hazards.
AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I               3 MARCH 2010                                       35


     4.3.2.2. Technologist Performance. The application of radiation for diagnosis or
     treatment shall only be performed by technologists (Diagnostic Imaging 4RXXX) who
     are trained and who have demonstrated proficiency in the use of the specific radiation
     producing device, or in the administration and use of the prescribed radioactive materials.
     Such proficiency should be IAW the American Society of Radiologic Technologists
     (ASRT) Position Statements and Scopes of Practice for technologists, assessed through
     national-performance-oriented evaluation procedures (American Registry of Radiologic
     Technologists—ARRT-- or equivalent), or by didactic training and practical experience
     equivalent or superior to training programs and examination requirements of recognized
     credentialing organizations (ARRT or equivalent). Technologists shall strive to ensure
     patient doses are as low as reasonably achievable while ensuring diagnostic and
     therapeutic objectives are achieved. Technologists, in general, are the largest population
     responsible for implementing and following the requirements of this Chapter.
     4.3.2.3. The above consideration for operators of radiation producing equipment should
     be implemented by the chief radiologist or NCOIC/Superintendent, Diagnostic Imaging
     through the responsible authority (MTF commander) in an instruction which details:
         4.3.2.3.1. Who may operate diagnostic x-ray equipment and the supervision required
         4.3.2.3.2. The education-training and/or proficiency requirements for imaging
         technologists, and
         4.3.2.3.3. Requirements for continuing education and demonstration of proficiency.
         4.3.2.3.4. This policy should be reviewed periodically and revised as appropriate.

  shall adhere to the most current requirements of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts
  1020.30 through 33 – Performance Standards for Ionizing Radiation Emitting Products. The
  radiation safety program for medical x-ray systems should be evaluated annually and once
  every four years for dental x-ray systems.
  4.3.5. Dosimetry Systems.
     4.3.5.1. Dosimetry systems used in diagnostic radiology or nuclear medicine shall be
     calibrated annually using National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)
     traceable sources. Records of calibration shall be maintained for three years.
     4.3.5.2. Dosimetry systems used in external beam radiation therapy shall have been
     calibrated by the NIST or by an American Association of Physicists in Medicine
     (AAPM) Accredited Dosimetry Calibration Laboratory (ADCL). The calibration shall
     have been performed within the previous 24 months and after any servicing that may
     have affected system calibration. A record of each dosimetry system calibration, inter-
     comparison, and comparison shall be maintained for three years. Each facility shall
     maintain two independent dosimetry systems or alternatively have a means of obtaining
     an independent determination of beam calibration on an annual basis using an ADCL-
36                                   AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 3 MARCH 2010


        calibrated electrometer and ionization chamber(s) not normally used by the facility for
        routine calibration.
4.4. General Requirements in the Clinical Use of X-Ray, Electron Beam and Gamma-Ray
Radiation. As a general principle, the dose to the patient shall be kept to a minimum consistent
with clinical objectives. Each MTF shall have and implement written operating and safety
procedures. These procedures shall be made available to each individual operating a radiation-
producing machine, including any restrictions of the operating technique required for the safe
operation of the particular system. These procedures shall be reviewed annually. Specific
requirements shall include, but are not limited to:
     4.4.1. The useful beam shall be limited to the smallest area practical and consistent with the
     objectives of the radiological examination or treatment.
     4.4.2. The tube potential, filtration and source-to-skin distance (SSD) employed in medical
     diagnostic examinations should be as large as practical, consistent with study objectives.
        4.4.2.1. Special care should be taken to insure that adequate and proper filtration is used
        for all diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
        4.4.2.2. The operator should use the maximum source to skin distance consistent with
        medical requirements of the procedure. For diagnostic procedures, other than dental
        procedures, distances less than 30 cm shall not be used.
     4.4.3. Protection of the embryo or fetus during radiological examination or treatment of
     women known to be pregnant shall be given special consideration, as described in section 4.5
     below.
     4.4.4. Techniques shall be appropriately modified for pediatric patients.
     4.4.5. Sensitive body organs (e.g. lens of eye, gonads) should be shielded whenever they are
     likely to be exposed to a useful beam provided such shielding does not interfere with useful
     diagnostic information or proper treatment. In addition:
        4.4.5.1. Gonadal shielding using at least 0.5 mm lead equivalence shall be used
        whenever potentially procreative individuals are likely to receive direct gonadal radiation
        in an exam or treatment or the primary beam is within 2.5 cm of the gonadal area.
        4.4.5.2. Shielding of breasts for scoliosis radiographs should be used due to the
        sensitivity of breast tissue in young women and the number of films likely to be taken in
        a lifetime. The lead must be placed between the source of x-rays and the patient. If there
        is no lead available, a posterior-anterior view should be used.
        4.4.5.3. The lens of the eye should be shielded with a least 2 mm lead equivalence during
        tomographic procedures that include the eye in the useful beam (Not required for
        posterior-anterior projections).
     4.4.6. Fluoroscopy (with the exception of microampere systems used in orthopedics) shall
     not be used as a substitute for radiography, but should be reserved for the study of dynamics,
     spatial relationships, guidance in spot film recording of critical detail and simulation in
     radiation therapy. Last image hold should be utilized whenever possible.
AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I                3 MARCH 2010                                      37


   4.4.7. X-ray films, intensifying screens, and other image recording devices shall be reviewed
   annually for maximum sensitivity, consistent with the requirements of the examination.
   Facilities shall adhere to the manufacturer's processing instructions.
   4.4.8. No person should routinely hold patients during diagnostic examinations.
      4.4.8.1. When a patient must be held in position mechanical supports or immobilization
      aids should be used.
      4.4.8.2. If mechanical devices cannot be used, the individual selected to hold the patient
      should be a relative, nursing or transport personnel. Diagnostic Imaging (4RXXX)
      technologists should be used at a last resort and then only in emergent (life/death) cases.
      4.4.8.3. Pregnant woman or persons under 18 years should not be permitted to hold
      patients.
      4.4.8.4. If a patient must be held by someone, the individual shall be protected with
      appropriate shielding devices such as gloves and aprons. Positioning should be arranged
      so that no part of the holder's torso is struck by the useful beam, and that the holder's
      body is as far as possible from the useful beam.
   4.4.9. Only individuals whose presence is necessary shall be in diagnostic x-ray, fluoroscopy
   or low-energy (< 150 kV) therapy x-ray rooms during exposures. These personnel shall be
   protected (e.g. leaded aprons, leaded gloves and/or portable shields).
   4.4.10. Individuals, other than the patient, shall not be in high energy (over 150 kV) therapy
   rooms during exposures.
   4.4.11. Protective devices, including aprons, gloves, and shields (include dental, cardio-lab
   and operating room gowns) shall be stored properly and checked annually for defects such as
   holes, cracks, and tears. These checks may be performed by the flight/element personnel by
   visual means (obvious rips or tears), or by diagnostic imaging technologists using x-ray
   imaging. Each facility must develop operating instructions stating unique identification
   methods, testing procedures, pass/fail criteria, documentation (i.e., device tagging and audit
   outcome) and proper procedures for disposal of rejected lead protective material.
   4.4.12. The operator shall stand behind a barrier, if provided, and shall observe the patient
   during diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. The operator shall be able to maintain verbal,
   visual, and aural contact with the patient.
   4.4.13. Radiation source systems and imaging systems, as well as film processors shall be
   subjected to an appropriate quality assurance program as described in section 4.6
   4.4.14. Radiographic film should not be used beyond its expiration date. Unprocessed film
   shall be protected by appropriate shielding and should not be exposed to more than 0.002
   mGy (0.2 mrad) prior to use.
4.5. X-Ray Examination of Women. Because of the radiation risk to the embryo or fetus, the
possibility of pregnancy shall be addressed in any woman of reproductive capacity when
considering any nuclear medicine procedure or any radiographic examination involving the
lower abdomen.
38                                    AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 3 MARCH 2010


     4.5.1. Before any diagnostic radiology or nuclear medicine procedure, the patient shall be
     asked if they are pregnant. Before any therapeutic procedure a pregnancy test will be given to
     all fertile women.
     4.5.2. Ideally, elective abdominal/pelvic examination of a woman of childbearing age should
     be performed during the first 14 days following the onset of menses to minimize the
     possibility of irradiation of the embryo. In practice, the timeliness of medical needs should be
     the primary consideration in deciding the timing of an examination.
     4.5.3. Radiographic and nuclear medicine waiting and/or examination rooms, other than
     those used exclusively for dentistry, shall be posted with appropriate signs alerting patients
     that if they may be pregnant to notify the physician or technician before the examination.
     4.5.4. In the event of a fetal exposure (i.e., the fetus or embryo is exposed to radiation) the
     responsible department shall:
        4.5.4.1. Have a qualified medical physicist (Attachment 5) determine by measurement
        or modeling the estimated dose to the fetus. These calculations shall be reported to the
        patient’s physician who will interpret them to the patient.
        4.5.4.2. Adhere to the requirements of section 4.14
4.6. Quality Control. A properly designed quality assurance program will contain a quality
control (QC) program that provides adequate confidence that a diagnostic x-ray or nuclear
medicine facility will produce consistently high quality images with minimum exposure to the
patients and medical staff. Similarly, a radiation therapy quality control program assists in
assuring treatments are performed with the optimum dose to tumor tissues and minimal dose to
healthy tissue of the patient with the least possible exposure to medical staff.
     4.6.1. Diagnostic Imaging Departments and Other Departments Utilizing Radiation Sources:
     All diagnostic imaging departments shall implement a quality control program; with the
     objective to minimize patient and staff dose while obtaining optimal clinical objectives. As a
     minimum, the program shall consist of the following elements:
        4.6.1.1. Acceptance Testing: A qualified (as defined in AFI 41-201) medical equipment
        repair center (MERC) technician or biomedical equipment technician (BMET) shall
        perform acceptance testing prior to clinical use of all new diagnostic x-ray systems and
        systems having undergone a significant component change (e.g., a new x-ray tube).
        Further, a qualified expert (medical physicist) should conduct or review an acceptance
        test of all new diagnostic medical systems, excluding dental radiology and veterinary
        radiology. Documentation of the acceptance test shall be maintained by the BMET or
        MERC for the duration of system use.
        4.6.1.2. Compliance Inspections: Annual compliance inspections by the responsible
        MERC and/or BMET. Inspection results shall be maintained IAW AFI 41-201.
        4.6.1.3. Quality Control Program: The department shall implement a quality control
        program that includes the following elements: reject/repeat or retake analysis program for
        film use or exposure factor for digital systems, dark room and film processor quality
        control, cassette/screen and view box inspection and cleaning, x-ray generator
        compliance with 21 CFR 1020, x -ray tube and collimator compliance with 21 CFR 1020,
        automatic exposure control performance and stability, and patient dose. Quality control
AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I              3 MARCH 2010                                      39


     data shall be reviewed annually and maintained for a period of five years. The
     repeat/reject rate will be tracked and should be within or below the national average
     repeat rate of 8%. Trends indicating a deterioration in performance or increase in patient
     dose should be investigated.
  4.6.2. Nuclear Medicine Departments: Nuclear medicine departments shall implement a
  quality control program for gamma cameras consisting of the following four elements (Note:
  other aspects of these departments quality control program are controlled by USAF
  Radioactive Material Permit):
     4.6.2.1. Acceptance Testing: A qualified medical physicist shall perform acceptance
     testing of a gamma camera prior to clinical use. The following tests shall be performed,
     based on current standards of practice (ref: American Association of Physicists in
     Medicine Report Numbers: 6, 9, 22, and 52): physical inspection of mechanical and
     electrical components, intrinsic energy peaking, intrinsic energy resolution, head
     shielding integrity, intrinsic and extrinsic uniformity, intrinsic linearity and spatial
     resolution, pixel size calibration, collimator integrity, rotational uniformity, maximum
     count rate performance, collimator sensitivity, center-of-rotation, temporal resolution,
     multiple window spatial resolution, and SPECT phantom evaluation. The following tests
     should be performed: intrinsic off-peak uniformity, collimator hole angulation, and
     system network verification. One must perform the planar imaging tests prior to the
     SPECT imaging tests. For multiple-plane gamma cameras, each plane or camera head
     must be evaluated and held within a tight tolerance of the other imaging planes. Also,
     each collimator must be evaluated for the respective tests for collimators and center-of-
     rotation. Documentation of the acceptance test shall be maintained for the duration of
     system use.
     4.6.2.2. Technologists QC Program: Routine QC shall be performed by nuclear medicine
     technologists each day the equipment is used, prior to clinical use. Technologists are
     responsible for ensuring the tested parameters are within performance limits. Each
     manufacturer provides minimal QC instructions in their associated operator’s manual and
     the performance limits for each required test. If no manufacturer's guidance, at a
     minimum, technologists must perform the following: energy peaking and extrinsic
     uniformity (flood) measurements daily; and center-of-rotation, intrinsic uniformity, and
     intrinsic linearity/ resolution images weekly. Potential trends should be tracked for
     energy peaking, center-of-rotation, intrinsic uniformity, and sensitivity. The SPECT
     phantom test should be performed once a quarterly plus a monthly uniformity test of each
     collimator. Documentation (electronic or film) of the uniformity, center-of-rotation,
     collimator, and SPECT phantom data shall be maintained for three years.
     4.6.2.3. Preventive Maintenance: The manufacturer or a third party contractor should
     perform preventive maintenance on the gamma camera twice a year. The service contract
     should provide for additional site visits when problems occur.
     4.6.2.4. Periodic Physics Inspection: A medical physicist shall implement a periodic QC
     program based on equipment age and performance. The specific tests listed in the
     acceptance testing section (Section 4.6.2.1) should be completed as well as using the data
     collected by the technologists.

     4.6.3. Radiation Oncology Departments using Therapy Linear Accelerators: Radiation
     oncology departments shall implement a quality control program overseen by a qualified
     therapeutic radiological physicist to insure the safe and optimum use of radiotherapy
     simulators, therapeutic x-ray units, medical linear accelerators, radiation therapy treatment
     planning systems, brachytherapy sources, therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, and associated
     ancillary equipment. See sections 4.11.3., 4.12.4. and 4.12.4.5 for additional specific
     requirements.
4.7. Specific Radiation Safety Requirements for Stationary Radiography (including digital
radiography and dental radiography). In addition to the general requirements specified under
section 4.4, the following requirements shall be applied to use of stationary radiographic
systems:
     4.7.1. Measurements of radiation exposure for each diagnostic x-ray unit shall be measured
     annually by MERC or BMET personnel. Measurments shall be made at least once every four
     years for dental x-ray units. The regional and/or MTF health or medical physicist shall use
     this data to estimate patient entrance skin exposures (ESE) for common radiographic
     procedures (ref: AAPM Monograph 20, 1991 AAPM Annual Summer School Proceedings
     held at University of California, Santa Cruz and OEHL Technical Report 97-12,
     DOSIMETRY IN DIAGNOSTIC RADIOLOGY, A Guide for Meeting JCAHO and ACR
     Requirements and ICRP Recommendations, Armstrong Laboratory, Occupational and
     Environmental Health Directorate, Brooks Air Force Base, TX, 1997) These ESEs will be
     available to each MTF.
     4.7.2. Exposures which are double the National Evaluation of X-Ray Trends (NEXT) data in
     Table 4.1 for the appropriate speed system used, should be evaluated. Exposures should not
     exceed the Entrance Skin Exposure Guidance (ESEG) listed in Table 4.1
     4.7.3. A technique chart relevant to the particular radiation producing machine shall be
     provided or electronically displayed in the vicinity of the control panel and used by all
     operators.

4.8. Specific Radiation Safety Requirements for Fluoroscopy. In addition to the general
requirements specified under section 4.4, the following requirements shall be applied to use of
fluoroscopic systems.
   4.8.1. Specific Radiation Safety Requirements for General Fluoroscopy.
       4.8.1.1. Fluoroscopic tabletop radiation exposure rates and spot films/cine exposures
       shall be measured annually. The regional and/or MTF health or medical physicist shall
       use this data to provide patient entrance skin exposure rates to each MTF or clinic.
       Clinicians shall be aware of the radiation exposure rates for the specific fluoroscopic
       system and for each mode of operation used during the clinical protocol.
       4.8.1.2. The radiation exposure rate used in fluoroscopy should be as low as is consistent
       with fluoroscopic requirements and not exceed those listed in 10 CFR 1020.32 at the
       point where the beam enters the patient.
       4.8.1.3. The total exposure time, physician, procedure type, and unit should be recorded
       for all fluoroscopic exams except during simulation for radiation therapy (general
       fluoroscopy, angiography, cardiac catheterization lab, etc.) per FDA guidelines. This data
       should be monitored on a monthly or quarterly basis to identify equipment, procedural, or
       personnel issues resulting higher than average exposures (i.e., average values listed in
       AAPM Report No. 58, Managing the use of Fluoroscopy in Medical Institutions).
       4.8.1.4. The smallest practical field sizes and the shortest irradiation times shall be
       employed, consistent with clinical objectives.
       4.8.1.5. Medical fluoroscopy shall be performed only by or under the immediate
       supervision of a physician properly trained in fluoroscopic procedures. The physician
       shall understand the proper use and limitations of the device to avoid needless exposure
       of the patient and other persons in the vicinity during use.
       4.8.1.6. Protective lead aprons of at least 0.5 mm lead equivalence shall be worn in the
       fluoroscopy room by all personnel (except the patient) during all fluoroscopy operations.
       4.8.1.7. Lead gloves of at least 0.25 mm lead equivalent should be worn by physicians
       during near beam work. The physician should not place hands in the direct beam, even
       with lead glove protection. If not using gloves, a ring dosimeter should be used.
       4.8.1.8. Eye protection in the form of leaded glass shields or leaded (prescription) eye
       glasses should be used for clinicians with high fluoroscopic workloads, such as those
       frequently performing interventional angiography and cardiac catheterization procedures.
   4.8.2. Specific Radiation Safety Requirements for Portable Fluoroscopic and Radiographic
   Procedures. In addition to the general requirements specified under section 4.4, the following
   additional requirements shall be applied to portable fluoroscopic and radiographic procedures
   (with the exception of microamp orthopedic units).
42                                   AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 3 MARCH 2010


        4.8.2.1. All unessential personnel possible shall stand at least 2 m (6 ft) from the patient,
        the x-ray tube and the useful beam during procedures.
        4.8.2.2. Mobile equipment should be used only for examinations when it is not practical
        or of necessary expediency to transfer patients to fixed radiographic or fluoroscopic
        installations.
     4.8.3. Specific Radiation Safety Requirements for Cardiac and Fluoroscopically Guided
     Procedures, and Simulators used for Radiation Therapy. In addition to the general
     requirements specified under section 4.4, the following additional requirements shall be
     applied during cardiac and interventional radiography procedures, pain management
     procedures and procedures involving simulators used in planning radiation therapy:
        4.8.3.1. In serial (cine) radiography, the number of films per second and the duration of
        the procedure should be kept to a minimum, consistent with clinical objectives.
        4.8.3.2. Cardiac/simulator fluoroscopy shall be performed only by or under the
        immediate supervision of a physician properly trained in cardiac/simulator fluoroscopic
        procedures.
        4.8.3.3. Avoidance of Serious X-Ray-Induced Skin Injuries to Patients During
        Fluoroscopically-Guided Procedures (ref: Burlington B.D., FDA Public Health Advisory:
        Avoidance of Serious X-Ray-Induced Skin Injuries to Patients During Fluoroscopically-
        Guided Procedures). To avoid skin doses which may result in acute injury, facilities
        performing fluoroscopically-guided procedures shall:
            4.8.3.3.1. Establish and document standard operating procedures and clinical
            protocols for each specific type of interventional procedure performed. The protocols
            should address all aspects of the procedure, such as patient selection, normal conduct
            of the procedure, actions in response to complications and consideration of limits on
            fluoroscopy exposure time. Protocols should also include a mechanism to report
            estimated patient exposure to the patient’s primary care physician for follow-up of
            lengthy procedures that might result in delayed reactions.
            4.8.3.3.2. Assess the impact of each procedure's protocol on the potential for
            radiation injury to the patient.
            4.8.3.3.3. Modify the protocol, as appropriate, to limit the cumulative absorbed dose
            to any irradiated area of the skin to the minimum necessary for the clinical tasks, and
            particularly to avoid approaching cumulative doses that would induce unacceptable
            adverse effects. Use equipment that aids in minimizing absorbed dose.
            4.8.3.3.4. Enlist a qualified medical physicist to assist in implementing these
            protocols in such a manner so as not to adversely affect the clinical objectives of the
            procedure.
            4.8.3.3.5. Report, IAW the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (SMDA) and 21 CFR
            Parts 803 to 807, any fluoroscopically induced injuries, following the procedures
            established by the facility for such mandatory reporting. Practitioners who become
            aware of any medical device related adverse event or product problem/malfunction
            should report to their Medical Device User Facility Reporting person. NOTE:
            Physicians should know that radiation-induced injuries from fluoroscopy are not
AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I                  3 MARCH 2010                                        43


           immediately apparent. Other than the mildest symptoms, such as transient erythema,
           the effects of the radiation may not appear until weeks following the exposure.
           Physicians performing these procedures may not be in direct contact with the patients
           following the procedure and may not observe the symptoms when they occur.
           Missing the milder symptoms in some patients can lead to surprise at the magnitude
           of the absorbed doses delivered to the skin of other patients when more serious
           symptoms appear. For this reason, the FDA recommends information be recorded in
           the appropriate folder from the AF Form 2100A series. Patients should also be
           informed via the consent form SF 522, Request for Administration of Anethesia and
           for Performance of Operations and Other Procedures, of potential injuries and
           advised to report signs and/or symptoms of radiation induced injury to their attending
           physician.
4.9. Specific Radiation Safety Requirements for Mammography Procedures. In addition to
the general requirements specified under section 4.4, the following requirements shall be applied
during mammography procedures.
   4.9.1. All Mammography services offered by USAF medical facilities shall adhere to the
   requirements of the Mammography Quality Standards Act, Title 21 CFR Parts 16 and 900.

   Practice for technologists.
4.10. Specific Radiation Safety Requirements for Computed Tomography Procedures. In
addition to the general requirements specified under section 4.4, the following requirements shall
be applied to computed tomography procedures.
   4.10.1. The slice thickness should be as great as practical and the number of slices in the
   study should be as small as possible.
   4.10.2. Contrast studies should be made only when necessary to provide critical diagnostic
   information.
   4.10.3. The user shall be familiar with the relationship between patient dose (both the
   maximum values and its distribution) and the operation techniques factors (kVp, mAs per
   slice and slice thickness) for the system. Special attention shall be given to pediatric patients.
   Patient size shall be matched to exposure settings and inappropriate referrals should be
   eliminated.
   4.10.4. Dose measurements of the radiation output of the CT x-ray system shall be
   performed by a qualified expert on an annual basis, or when a major change (i.e tube
   replacement) occurs in the system or in system operation. The computed tomography dose
   index (CTDI) or the multiple scan average dose (MSAD) shall be determined for common
   system parameters using the current procedures prescribed by the AAPM (ref: AAPM
   Monograph 20, 1991 AAPM Annual Summer School Proceedings held at University of
   California, Santa Cruz).

  from patient intervention) in which the administration of machine produced radiation results
  in:
     4.13.1.1. A dose that exceeds 0.05 Sv (5 rem) effective dose equivalent, 0.5 Sv (50 rem)
     to an organ or tissue, or 0.5 Sv (50 rem) shallow dose equivalent to the skin, and any of
     the following:
         4.13.1.1.1. The total dose delivered differs from the prescribed dose by 10 percent or
         more;
         4.13.1.1.2. The fractionated dose delivered exceeds the prescribed dose, for a single
         fraction, by 50 percent or more;
         4.13.1.1.3. An administration of a dose or dosage to the wrong individual;
         4.13.1.1.4. An administration of a dose or dosage delivered by the wrong mode of
         treatment; or
         4.13.1.1.5. A geographic miss causing a dose to an organ or tissue other than the
         treatment site that exceeds 50 percent or more of the prescribed fraction size.
  4.13.2. The service shall report any event resulting from intervention of a patient or human
  research subject in which the administration of machine produced radiation results or will
  result in an unintended permanent functional damage to an organ or a physiological system,
  as determined by a physician.
  4.13.3. The service shall notify the responsible Medical Group’s Chief of Hospital Services
  (SGH), or his/her designee, no later than the next calendar day after discovery of the medical
  event. The SGH will then determine, based upon consultation with the responsible oncologist
  and referring physician or service, whether or not the event involves risk of permanent injury
  to the patient or subject. If such risk is determined to be present the event becomes a
  reportable medical misadministration. The Service will then telephonically report the
  misadministration to the AFMOA/SGZR within 7 calendar days.
  4.13.4. The service shall submit a written report to AFMOA/SGZR through the responsible
  MAJCOM/SGP within 15 days after discovery of the medical event (RCS: HAF-
  SG(AR)0117, Report of Medical Events and Unplanned Fetal Exposures). This report is

            4.13.4.1.8. If there was notification, what information was provided.
        4.13.4.2. The report may not contain the individual's name or any other information that
        could lead to identification of the individual.
     4.13.5. The service shall notify the referring physician, or, if unavailable, the responsible
     referring service chief and also notify the individual affected by the medical event no later
     than 24 hours after its discovery, unless the referring physician or service chief elects to
     personally inform the individual or that, based on medical judgment, telling the individual
     would be harmful. The service is not required to notify the individual without first consulting
     the referring physician. If the referring physician or the affected individual cannot be reached
     within 24 hours, the service shall notify the individual as soon as possible thereafter. The
     Service may not delay any appropriate medical care for the individual, including any
     necessary remedial care as a result of the medical event, because of any delay in notification.
     To meet the requirements of this section, the notification of the individual receiving the
     medical event may be made instead to that individual’s responsible relative or guardian.
     4.13.6. If the individual was notified under paragraph 4.13.5 of this section, the Service
     shall also furnish a written report to the individual within 15 days after discovery of the

         recurrence;
  4.14.4. The service shall notify the referring physician, or if unavailable, the referring
  physician’s service responsible chief of service and also notify the pregnant individual or
  mother, both hereafter referred to as the mother, no later than 24 hours after discovery of an
  event that would require reporting under paragraph 4.14.1 of this section, unless the
  referring physician or chief of service personally informs the service either that he or she will
  inform the mother or that, based on medical judgement, telling the mother would be harmful.
  4.14.5. To meet the requirements of this section, the notification may be made to the
  mother’s or child’s responsible relative or guardian instead of the mother, when appropriate.
  4.14.6. The service is not required to notify the mother without first consulting with the

                                            Chapter 5

                 RADIATION PROTECTION OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC

5.1. General. Public exposures of concern for the purposes of this instruction include those
resulting directly from USAF occupational and medical practices, and those resulting from
uncontrolled sources such as naturally occurring radiation and from accidents or incidents.
5.2. Control of General Public Exposures from USAF Practices. In almost all cases,
engineering controls, policies or procedures are implemented to control general public exposures
from USAF practices. The following requirements are specified for all USAF practices that may
result in public exposure:
     5.2.1. All practices shall be conducted so as to minimize general public exposures, with
     economic, military and social factors being taken into account.
     5.2.2. All practices shall be conducted in such a manner that a member of the general public
     will not exceed the dose limits specified in Table A4.1 For non-medical practices, the
     installation RSO shall be responsible for the assessment either by measurement or calculation
     that this dose is not exceeded, and maintain this record for a period of three years. For
     medical practices, the responsible medical physicist, health physicist or bioenvironmental
     engineer, as appropriate, shall be responsible for this assessment.
     5.2.3. Unrestricted areas. The dose in any unrestricted area resulting from USAF controlled
     radiation sources will not exceed 0.02 mSv (2 mrem) in any one hour, or 1 mSv (100 mrem)
     in a year, occupancy and use factors being taken into account. This requirement does not
     apply to those excepted by 10 CFR 35.75. The installation RSO shall be responsible for the
     assessment, either by measurement or calculation that these dose rates are not exceeded, and
     maintain this record for a period of three years.
     5.2.4. Control of Visitors.
        5.2.4.1. Visitors to any restricted area must be accompanied by persons knowledgeable
        about the protection and safety measures in the area.
        5.2.4.2. Visitors must be provided adequate information and instruction before they enter
        a restricted area to ensure appropriate protection of the visitors and of other personnel in
        the area.
        5.2.4.3. Visitors entering defined "Radiation Areas" or "High Radiation Areas", or that
        could incur a deep dose equivalent in excess of 0.10 mSv (10 mrem) shall be provided
        personal monitoring devices. The department shall maintain a log of all such monitored
        individuals, and communicate the results of monitoring to the individual.
     5.2.5. Public Overexposures. If an individual member of the general public may have
     received a dose in excess of the applicable limit in Table A4.1, that dose and practice shall
     be immediately investigated by the installation RSO. If appropriate, the unit, organization or
     installation RSO should implement, with commander’s approval, protective actions to
     mitigate further exposures.
        5.2.5.1. Notification:
AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I                  3 MARCH 2010                                       53


           5.2.5.1.1. When a member of the general public may have received a dose above the
           limits set in Table A4.1, the installation RSO shall be contacted immediately, who in-
           turn should contact AFIERA/SDRH ((210) 393-6968) to validate the assessment of
           dose.
           5.2.5.1.2. If the dose is validated, the installation RSO should then notify within 3
           hours the MAJCOM Bioenvironmental Engineer and AFMOA/SGZR, in-turn.
       5.2.5.2. Reporting: The installation RSO, with the assistance of AFIERA/SDRH, shall
       investigate suspected exposures above the limits specified in Table A4.1, with a written
       report of the investigation submitted through the MAJCOM Bioenvironmental Engineer
       to AFMOA/SGZR within 7 days of notification (RCS: HAF-SG(AR)0116, Report of
       Occupational or Public Overexposure to Radiation). This report is designated emergency
       status code C-1. Continue reporting during emergency conditions. The written report
       must include:
           5.2.5.2.1. The organization’s name and office symbol where the exposure occurred
           5.2.5.2.2. A brief description of the event
           5.2.5.2.3. A description of the person(s) exposed and their estimated dose equivalent
           5.2.5.2.4. Why the event occurred
           5.2.5.2.5. What actions, if any, have been taken or are planned to prevent recurrence;
5.3. Protection of the General Public from Uncontrolled Radiation Sources. This section
specifies requirements to protect members of the general public from uncontrolled sources of
ionizing radiation. Two specific sources are identified: general public exposures resulting from
natural sources of radiation, specifically radon, and general public exposures that may occur
from a nuclear or radiological incident. For each case, interventions may be necessary to protect
the public. For the prior case, the exposure at which an intervention is merited is referred to as a
remedial action level. During a nuclear or radiological incident, a protective action or
intervention is merited when a certain dose, referred to as the avertable dose, can be avoided by
conducting the intervention or implementing the protective action.
   5.3.1. Radon Exposure: Radon is a naturally occurring decay product of uranium that can
   infiltrate structures. The decay of radon produces a series of radioactive progeny, which,
   when inhaled, can lead to exposure of the bronchial epithelium, principally by alpha
   radiation. Radon in existing structures, either residences or places of work can only be
   influenced by an intervention, i.e. mitigation. The following requirements are specified to
   address those facilities and operating locations not originally assessed in the USAF Radon
   Assessment and Mitigation Program of 1987 (USAF OEHL Report 87-132RZ0111KRD, The
   Bioenvironmental Engineer’s Primer to the Air Force Radon Assessment and Mitigation
   Program (RAMP)). During that study, all installations at the time were screened for radon in
   existing structures. Bases were classified as being of low, medium or high risk if any of the
   screening measurements identified at least one department with radon concentration greater
   than 4 pCi/l (EPA medium risk guideline), or 20 pCi/l (EPA high risk guideline).
       5.3.1.1. Newly Constructed or Acquired Structures on Medium and High Risk
       Installations: Any new enclosed structure for installations that underwent a detailed
       assessment as part of the Radon Assessment and Mitigation Program of 1987 shall be
54                                   AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 3 MARCH 2010


        assessed by the installation RSO for exposure to radon progeny, with the exception of:
        hangars, maintenance bays, dedicated storage facilities, structures occupied less than four
        hours per day, temporary facilities, and elevated structures with unobstructed air flows
        underneath.
            5.3.1.1.1. New structures should not be tested for one year after construction to allow
            for foundation settling.
            5.3.1.1.2. Monitoring shall be performed using a long-term monitor (e.g. alpha track
            detector or long-term electret), processed by an EPA certified supplier, in the lowest
            occupied location of the structure.
            5.3.1.1.3. Structures identified with radon concentrations greater than 4 pCi/l
            (resulting in exposures of 3.5x10-3 Jh/m3 per year or one WLM per year) shall be
            remediated by base civil engineering to levels as low as reasonably achievable, and
            result in exposures less than 4 pCi/ l (or one WLM per year). The remediation
            schedule should adhere to the following schedule: > 20 pCi/l within one year, 4 20
            pCi/l, within 1-3 years. All structures requiring remediation shall be remediated
            within 6 years from the time of assessment.
            5.3.1.1.4. Structures having been remediated shall be reassessed by the installation
            RSO for ambient radon concentrations no less than two weeks and no greater than 6
            months post remediation to validate the efficacy of the remedial action. A
            combination of short-term and long-term monitoring should be conducted to assure
            acceptable radon levels have been achieved.
        5.3.1.2. New Installations or Installations Never Previously Assessed: For existing
        installations not assessed during the Radon Assessment and Mitigation Program of 1987,
        and for all new, permanent operating locations, a random sampling of the structures shall
        be assessed for radon. AFI- ERA shall be consulted on designing an appropriate sampling
        program. Any installation found to have a single structure with concentrations greater
        than 4 pCi/l shall undergo a detailed assessment, consistent with the Radon Assessment
        and Mitigation Program of 1987.
        5.3.1.3. Base civil engineering should design and construct new structures on bases on
        medium and high risk bases with radon resistant features.
     5.3.2. Exposure Resulting from Other Natural Sources of Radiation: On rare occasions,
     members the general public may be exposed to natural sources of radiation, other than radon,
     that are significant. If the installation RSO becomes aware of conditions when exposures to a
     member of the general public from a natural source, other then radon, would exceed 5 mSv
     (500mrem) annually, AFIERA/SDRH through the MAJCOM Bioenvironmental Engineer
     should be consulted for additional guidance.
     5.3.3. Uncontrolled Exposures Resulting from Radiological Incidents and Accidents.
        5.3.3.1. Members of the general public that are under the protection of an installation
        commander shall be protected during emergency situations from exposure to radiation to
        the greatest extent possible. Specific protective measures that can be implemented are
        listed in Attachment 6, Table A6.2 The decision to invoke a protective action, i.e.
        sheltering or evacuation, should be based on whether the action will allow the population
AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I              3 MARCH 2010                                       55


    to avert (or avoid) the recommended threshold dose provided with a given action or
    intervention. Political, military, legal or other factors will also influence implementing a
    given protective action.
    5.3.3.2. Table A6. 2., (IAEA, Intervention Criteria in a Nuclear or Radiation
    Emergency, Safety Series No. 109 and IAEA, International Basic Safety Standards for
    Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources, Safety
    Series No. 115) specifies generic intervention levels (GILs) at which urgent and longer-
    term protective actions should be taken to protect the general public. These levels were
    selected so that the protective actions would do more good than harm. For example,
    potassium iodide (100 mg IPO) should be administered if a thyroid dose of 100 mGy (10
    rad) or greater is expected to occur as a result of some accident or incident. It must be
    recognized that implementing a protection action carries its own inherent risks. Specified
    GILs are intended to allow avoidance of health risks from radiation exposure that would
    be greater than the risks posed by the protective action. Applying protective actions at
    considerably lower or higher GIL values could increase the overall risk to the general
    public or workers.
    5.3.3.3. GILs are difficult to apply in emergency situations because they cannot be
    directly measured. Local or regional planners should derive Operational Intervention
    Levels (OILs) for easily measured quantities that allow determination of whether a
    protective action should be implemented (refer to Table A6.2).

                                             Chapter 6

                 RADIATION PROTECTION DURING INTERVENTIONS

6.1. General. This chapter provides policy for protecting USAF personnel conducting actions
in uncontrolled radiation environments. These environments may include deployed locations
where known or suspected nuclear or radiological hazards exist and radiological environments
created by hostile action or nuclear incident or accident. Interventions are specific actions
performed in these environments to mitigate the source(s) of exposure, to save life or limb,
protect high value assets, or achieve higher objectives that may merit personnel incur risks
greater than those permitted for practices (RE: section 1.4). This section also applies to nuclear
capable units and units with 91(b) material.
6.2. Radiation Protection Policy and Guidance for Interventions.
     6.2.1. An intervention should be justified. A proposed intervention should do more good
     than harm, i.e., the action should be of sufficient value in terms of military objective to be
     achieved or humanitarian assistance to be rendered so as to justify the harm and costs
     (including societal costs) of the action.
     6.2.2. An intervention should be optimized. The form, scale, and duration of the intervention
     should be so established that there is maximum benefit and minimum risk and harm to those
     performing the action. Individual doses should be maintained as low as reasonably
     achievable.
     6.2.3. Dose guidance should be developed for a given intervention. Dose limits do not apply
     for interventions. Instead, the operational dose guidance (ODG) presented in Table A7.1 is to
     be utilized to guide surveillance and protection. The table lists five categories of dose and
     recommended protection and surveillance actions for doses projected in that range. The
     commander’s decision to allow this exposure should be made in the context of the situation
     and balance the anticipated benefit with both short and long-term health risks the exposure
     may cause.
        6.2.3.1. Although the dose contributed by ingestion or inhalation of radioactive material
        cannot be accurately measured in the field, it can be estimated for operational purposes.
        Depending on the type of radioactive material and its dispersed form, the internal dose
        may be much larger than the external dose for a given operation.
        6.2.3.2. Medical authorities should recommend personal protective equipment (PPE),
        including respiratory protection. Commanders will dictate PPE use based on operational
        risk analysis. Operational risk analysis should include the detriment posed by reduced
        vision, hearing, mobility, and tactile sensation; increased heat and psychological stress;
        increased time to complete tasks, and decreased task accuracy when wearing PPE. These
        in turn can lead to increases in external radiation exposures and the magnitude of other
        mission risks.
     6.2.4. Voluntary Participation. Where practical, interventions predicted to result in
     significant exposures (those greater than practice limits) should make use of volunteers to the
     greatest extent possible.
AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I                 3 MARCH 2010                                      57


   6.2.5. Excluded Populations. Operational personnel that are, or may be, pregnant, or that are
   less than18 years of age shall not conduct interventions.
6.3. Allowable Contamination Levels.
   6.3.1. Attachment 7, Table A7.2 and Table A7.3 provide recommended contamination
   levels for clothing and equipment for each of the five dose categories listed in Table A7.1
   Table A7.2 provides accepted level for a week-long (7 day) operation and Table A7.3
   provides comparable values for a 3-month operation.
   6.3.2. Contamination detected on skin should be managed through appropriate
   decontamination to levels that are as low as reasonably achievable using methods described
   in AFMAN 44-161(l) or AFJ- MAN 44-151. In some operational environments where
   thorough decontamination may be unavailable, skin contamination should not exceed the
   levels specified for Category 1A of Table A7.3
   6.3.3. Operational implementation of these contamination standards should follow
   procedures in Allied Engineering Publication-49, NATO Handbook for Sampling and
   Identification of Radiological Agents (SIRA), Volume 1 (Operational) and 2 (Forensic), or
   guidance provided by the assigned radiation protection personnel.
6.4. Training and Risk Communication. Personnel participating in an intervention shall be
informed of the potential health risks their radiation exposure may result in, and trained in the
necessary principles and procedures to minimize their exposure consistent with section 3.3 of
this instruction. Dependent on the nature of the intervention, training should be provided by
medical radiation protection personnel.
6.5. Monitoring During Interventions. Implementing operational risk management and
supporting operational dose guidance requires the ability to estimate or measure individual
doses. This is optimally done through the use of radiation survey instruments (e.g. ADM-300,
AN/VDR-2, AN/PDR-77), environmental sampling, personnel dosimeters, bioassays, and
biodosimetry assays.
   6.5.1. Personnel deployed in known or potential radiation environments shall be provided
   individual dosimeters.
   6.5.2. Personnel entering contaminated environments should be afforded in-vitro or in-vivo
   bioassays to determine the extent of internal exposures if internal contamination is suspected.
   6.5.3. If individual dosimetry or prompt bioassay measurements are not available, efforts
   will be made to estimate individual doses through group dosimetry, radiation survey and
   environmental monitoring data, modeling, dose reconstructions, or other methods consistent
   with currently accepted scientific practice.
   6.5.4. Systematic, individual dose records for external and internal exposures shall be
   maintained indefinitely, even if the dosimeter or bioassay result is zero. Results shall be
   maintained in the USAF MRER, and the individuals medical record.
       6.5.4.1. For units for which group dosimetry is used, doses as measured shall be
       averaged and applied to the entire group for the purposes of applying the Commanders
       Dose Guidance in Table A7.1 The radiation safety officer supporting the unit shall track
       unit doses, determine the acceptability of the unit dose to reflect individual doses, and
58                                    AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 3 MARCH 2010


        forward this dose information for each unit member for inclusion in the MRER and the
        individuals medical records.
        6.5.4.2. Classification of exposure data may prevent its inclusion in the MRER. Medical
        authorities for the command conducting classified operations shall maintain and be able
        to access all classified exposure data, ensuring all releasable data is available for
        maintenance in the MRER and to the monitored individual.
     6.5.5. Reports of dosimetry or bioassay results shall be given promptly to the potentially
     exposed individual and their commander or his delegated representative.
     6.5.6. The risks of stochastic health effects (e.g. cancer) are considered directly proportional
     to the total dose received by an individual. Commanders need to be aware of individual dose
     histories when planning future operations where radiation threats exist.
6.6. Medical Diagnosis and Treatment. Personnel receiving unknown doses of radiation or
doses exceeding the limits established for practices should receive care IAW Air Force Manual
44-161 (l), Treatment of Nuclear and Radiological Casualties, NCRP Report 65, Management of
Persons Accidentally Contaminated with Radionuclides; and NATO Manual AMedP-6(B), NATO
Handbook on the Medical Aspects of NBC Defensive Operations, Part I - Nuclear, or consistent
with currently accepted practice.
6.7. Medical Surveillance.
     6.7.1. Doses Greater than 50 mSv (5 rem): On completion of a military operation or
     operations involving radiation exposure, long term, periodic health monitoring is required for
     individuals receiving cumulative effective doses in excess of 50 mSv (5 rem). Such follow-
     up shall be formed through AFIERA, and may include, but not be limited to:
        6.7.1.1. Creation of a registry for the impacted population.
        6.7.1.2. Submission of biological or bioassay samples to determine absorbed dose and
        residual burdens of radioactive material, respectively.
        6.7.1.3. Annual or biannual medical examination, particularly following the latent
        periods of known radiogenic cancers. Known radiogenic cancers include leukemia,
        multiple myeloma, lymphomas, thyroid, breast, lung, esophageal, stomach, urinary tract,
        skin, and colon.
     6.7.2. Doses Less than 50 mSv (5 rem): For those personnel who have received doses less
     than current occupational dose limits, testing and monitoring should be limited to those
     testing and monitoring programs included in guidelines for the general population (e.g.
     routine mammography, pap smears, and prostate specific antigen testing).
        6.7.2.1. Health monitoring may include submission of bioassay samples to document
        intakes of radionuclides, and screening for cancers consistent with current medical
        practices.

91(b) Material—Radioactive material exempted from NRC licensing controls under Section
91(b) of the AEA of 1954, as amended, in the interest of national defense, under the possession
of the DOD. These include the radioactive materials in nuclear weapons – e.g. uranium
isotopes, plutonium isotopes, tritium, and other radioactive components of nuclear weapons.
These also include the components of nuclear reactors that fall under the definition of 91(b).
Absorbed Dose—The energy imparted by ionizing radiation per unit mass of irradiated material.
The units of absorbed dose are the rad and the gray (Gy), (100 rad = 1 Gy).
Activity—The rate of disintegration (transformation) or decay of radioactive material. The units
of activity are the Curie (Ci) and the becquerel (Bq).
Administrative Dose—The total effective dose equivalent that an RSO assigns when dosimetry
is inaccurate or has been misused or lost.
ALARA—Acronym for ―        as low as is reasonably achievable‖ means making every reasonable
effort to maintain exposures to radiation as far below applicable dose limits as is practical,
consistent with the purpose for which the activity is undertaken, taking into account the state of
technology, the economics of improvements in relation to benefits to the public health and
safety, and other societal and socioeconomic considerations and in relation to utilization of
nuclear energy, radioactive materials, and ionizing radiation in the public interest.
Annual Limit of Intake (ALI)—The derived limit for the amount of radioactive material taken
into the body of an adult worker by inhalation or ingestion in a year. The ALI is the smallest
value of intake of a given radionuclide in a year that would result in a committed effective dose
equivalent of 0.05 Sv (5 rems) or a committed dose of 0.5 Sv (50 rems) to any organ or tissue.
Background Radiation—Radiation from cosmic sources; naturally occurring radioactive
material, including radon; and global fallout as it exists in the environment from the testing of
nuclear explosive devices or from past nuclear accidents such as Chernobyl that contribute to
background radiation. ―   Background radiation‖ does not include radiation from source,
byproduct, or special nuclear materials that the NRC regulates or from NORM that the Air Force
regulates through AFI 40-201.
Becquerel (Bq)—The SI unit of radioactivity equivalent to one nuclear transformation per
second.
Bioassay (radiobioassay)—The determination of kinds, quantities or concentrations, and, in
some cases, the locations of radioactive material in the human body, whether by direct
AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I                 3 MARCH 2010                                     67


measurement (in-vivo bioassay) or by analysis and evaluation of materials excreted or removed
from the human body (in-vitro bioassay).
Byproduct Material—Any radioactive material (except source material and special nuclear
material) yielded in or made radioactive by exposure to the radiation incident to the process of
producing or utilizing special nuclear material.
Curie (Ci)—A unit of radioactivity equal to 37 billion becquerels.
Committed Dose Equivalent—The dose equivalent to organs or tissues that will be received
from the intake of radioactive material by an individual during the 50-year period following the
intake.
Conceptus—The developing human organism from conception until time of birth. Also referred
to as the embryo/fetus.
Declared Pregnant Woman—A woman who has voluntarily informed her employer, in writing,
of her pregnancy and the estimated date of conception.
Deep Dose Equivalent—The dose assigned to personnel from external whole-body exposure, it
is the dose equivalent at a tissue depth of one cm (1000 mg/cm2 ). Expressed in units of rem or
seivert (Sv).
Derived Air Concentration (DAC)—The concentration of a given radionuclide in air that, if
breathed for a working year of 2,000 hours under conditions of light work (inhalation rate of 1.2
cubic meters of air per hour), results in an inhalation of one ALI.
Deterministic Effect—Biological effects for which the severity of the effect in an exposed
individual varies with the dose, and for which a threshold usually exists (e.g. skin erythema and
cataracts).
Diagnostic Source—In the healing arts, a source of radiation used in the diagnosis of injury or
disease. Includes: x-ray units (fixed, portable, fluoroscopy, computed radiography, computed
tomography, etc.), radioactive materials (capsules, liquids or gases) used in nuclear medicine,
and radioactive materials used in a laboratory setting to perform ― in-vitro‖ studies (on blood,
urine, cells, etc.).
Dose Equivalent—A quantity used for radiation protection to indicate the biological
effectiveness of different radiations to cause stochastic health effects (e.g. cancer). The dose
equivalent equals the absorbed dose multiplied by a radiation quality factor, Q. Expressed in
units of rem or seivert (Sv).
Effective Dose—The sum over specified tissues of the equivalent dose or dose equivalent in a
tissue multiplied by a weighting factor for that tissue, wT. Expressed in unit of seivert (Sv) or
rem (100 rem = 1
Sv).
Electron Volt (eV)—A unit of energy equal to 1.6 × 10-19 joule.
Equivalent Dose—A quantity used for radiation protection to indicate the biological
effectiveness of different radiations to cause stochastic health effects (e.g. cancer). The
equivalent dose equals the absorbed dose multiplied by a radiation weighting factor, wR.
Expressed in units of seivert (Sv) or rem.

Exposure—In radiation protection, the act or occurrence of being exposed to ionizing radiation
or radioactive material. In risk management, the frequency and length of time subjected to a
hazard.
Gray (Gy)—The SI unit of any absorbed dose. One gray is equal to the absorption of one joule
per kilogram of material (1 Gy =100 rads).
Hazard—Any real or potential condition that can cause injury, illness, death of personnel,
damage to or loss of equipment or property, or mission degradation.
High Radiation Area—An area, accessible to individuals, in which radiation levels could result
in an individual receiving a dose equivalent in excess of 1 mSv (100 mrem) in 1 hour at 30
centimeters from the radiation source or from any surface that the radiation penetrates.
Installation—A grouping of facilities located in the same vicinity, which support particular
functions. Installations may be elements of a base. The term ―         installation‖ applies to real
properties such as depots, arsenals, hospitals, terminals, and other special mission installations.
Intervention—An activity that is not part of a controlled practice and is intended to reduce or
mitigate sources of existing exposure (e.g. radon in structures); actions that save life or limb or
mitigate threats greater than that posed by radiation; or those that are done to achieve higher
objectives, including those of national security.
Intrinsic Radiation—Ionizing radiation emitted through the weapon surface or directly from
exposed components of nuclear weapons.

            QUANTITIES AND TERMS USED IN RADIATION PROTECTION

A2.1. General. Ionization is the process by which atoms lose, or sometimes gain electrons and
thus become electrically charged. Ionizing radiation are those forms of sub-atomic particles and
electromagnetic waves that are capable of causing ionization in matter. Historically, the
quantities used to measure the ―  amount‖ of ionizing radiation have been defined by the gross
number of ionizing events in a given mass of material. The most commonly used quantity
reported in early radiation protection was the Roentgen (R) equal to the quantity of x-ray or
gamma radiation producing ions in air carrying one electrostatic unit of charge per cubic
centimeter of air. At standard temperature and pressure, this is equivalent to 2.58x10-4 Coulomb
per kilogram of air. Although this quantity is still in use, the more appropriate units for radiation
protection are based on the ionizations that occur in given mass of human tissue, and the
subsequent risk of biological affect that that ―dose‖ may cause.
A2.2. Absorbed Dose. The fundamental dose quantity in radiation protection is the absorbed
dose, D. This is the energy absorbed per unit mass and is in units of joule per kilogram, which is
given the special name gray (Gy). One Gy is equal to 100 rad, the conventional quantity of
absorbed dose equal to 100 ergs/ gm.
A2.3. Quality Factors and Dose Equivalent. The probability of stochastic health effects (like
cancer) is dependent not only on the absorbed dose, but also on the type of radiation causing the
dose. This has been taken into account by weighting the absorbed dose at a point in tissue with a
quality factor, Q, for a given radiation. The quality factor in turn is based on the density of
ionization along a track of the radiation as it traverses a tissue, referred to as its linear energy
transfer or LET. The weighted absorbed dose under this system is called the dose equivalent, H,
and expressed in units of rem. The dose equivalent is the dosimetric quantity used in Title 10,
Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, for the purposes of radiation protection from radioactive
material. For the purposes of individual monitoring using personnel dosimetry, three specific
quantities of dose equivalent are used:
     A2.3.1. Deep Dose Equivalent, Hd, is the dose equivalent measured at a tissue depth of 1 cm
     (1000 mg/cm2) beneath the outer surface of the skin. It is the primary dose reported in the
     USAF personnel dosimetry program. The deep dose equivalent is derived from the more
     general Individual Dose Equivalent, Penetrating, Hp(d). This is defined as the dose
     equivalent in soft tissue at a depth ―d‖ in the body that is appropriate for penetrating
     radiations.
     A2.3.2. Shallow Dose Equivalent, Hs, is the dose equivalent measured at a tissue depth of
     0.007 cm (7 mg/cm2, the average depth of the germinal cell layer) averaged over an area of 1
     cm2. This is otherwise referred to as the shallow or skin dose in the USAF personnel
     dosimetry program. The shallow dose equivalent is derived from the Individual Dose
     Equivalent, Superficial, Hs(d). This is defined as the dose equivalent in soft tissue at a depth
     ―d‖ in the body that is appropriate both weakly and strongly penetrating radiations.
     A2.3.3. Lens Dose Equivalent, HE, is the dose equivalent to the lens of the eye from external
     irradiation. It is measured at an eye lens tissue depth of 0.3 cm (300 mg/cm2).

A2.4. Radiation Weighting Factors and Equivalent Dose. The most recent paradigm in
radiation protection emphasizes the absorbed dose averaged over a tissue or organ (as opposed to
a point) and weighted for the radiation quality. The weighting factor for this purpose is currently
called the radiation weighting factor, wR , and is selected for the type and energy of the radiation
incident on the body or, in the cases of sources within the body, emitted by the source. The
absorbed dose in a tissue, multiplied by the radiation weighting factors is called the equivalent
dose, HT. This can be expressed as:




where DT,R is the absorbed dose averaged over the tissue or organ T, due to radiation R. The unit
of equivalent dose is the joule per kilogram, with the special name sievert (Sv).
The radiation weighting factor, wR, for a given type and energy of radiation is representative of
the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of that radiation to inducing stochastic health effects at
low doses. The values of wR are roughly comparable with the values of Q, and are summarized in
Table A2.1.

A2.5. Tissue Weighting Factors and Effective Dose. The relation between the probability of
stochastic effects and equivalent dose also depends on the organ or tissue irradiated. The
effective dose is used to express the probability of occurrence of cancer and hereditary effects
whether the dose is received by the whole body via uniform irradiation or by partial body or
76                                   AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 3 MARCH 2010


individual organ irradiation. The factor by which the equivalent dose in tissue or organ T is
weighted is called the tissue weighting factor, wT, and represents the relative contribution of that
organ or tissue to the total detriment due to cancer and hereditary effects resulting from uniform
irradiation of the whole body. The weighted equivalent dose is given the name effective dose
equivalent, or more simply, the effective dose, E, and again has units of joule per kilogram with
the special name seivert (Sv). The effective dose is the sum of the weighted equivalent doses for
all irradiated tissues or organs.




where HT is the equivalent dose in tissue or organ T and wT is the weighting factor for tissue T.
Tissue weighting factors are given in Table A2.2. So that a uniform whole body equivalent
dose results in an effective dose that is numerically the same, the sum of the tissue weighting
factors is one.

A2.6. Committed Equivalent Dose and Committed Effective Dose. Following an intake of
radionuclides in the body, there is a period during which the material irradiates various organs
and tissues. The committed equivalent dose, HT(τ) is the integral of the equivalent dose rate in a
specific tissue (T) following intake of a radionuclide in the body. For the purpose of radiation
AFI48-148_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I                 3 MARCH 2010                                     77


protection, the time of integration is taken as 50 years for occupational exposures and 70 years
for members of the general public. The committed effective dose, E(τ), for each internally
deposited radionuclide is calculated by summing the products of the committed equivalent doses
and the appropriate wT values for all tissues irradiated. The expression for the occupational
committed effective dose equivalent is given as:




A2.7. Total Effective Dose. This is the sum of the deep dose equivalent, Hd, and committed
effective dose, E(50). Limits on occupational and public radiation dose apply to the sum of
relevant doses from external exposure deep-dose equivalent in a year and the 50 year committed
effective dose from intakes in the same year. The total effective dose can be expressed as:




A2.8. Working Level Months. Exposure to radon and its progeny is not measured in the
conventional dosimetric quantities described above. Instead exposures are generally indicated by
the working-level, a unit originally developed to describe exposures of uranium miners to radon.
One working level is defined as that concentration of radon daughters in air that has a potential
alpha energy release of 1.3x105 MeV in a liter of air, equivalent to 2x10-5 Joule per cubic meter
of air (J/m3). One working level month (WLM, or 3.5x10-3 Jh/m3) would be the exposure
received by being present in that concentration for one working month, equivalent to 170 hours.
Exposure to one WLM results in an estimated absorbed dose to the lung of 4 - 13 mGy (0.4 to
1.3 rad). Based on uranium minor cohorts, lung cancer probabilities are estimated in the broad
range of 1 to 4 x 10-4 per WLM. One WLM is approximately equal to an annual exposure of 4
pCi per liter of radon, if the radon decay products are in 50 percent equilibrium with the radon.

          MEDICAL CONSEQUENCES OF IONIZING RADIATION EXPOSURE

A3.1. General. Exposure of living cells by ionizing radiation can result in changes to their
atoms and molecules and thus may result in damage to the cells. If cellular damage does occur,
and is not adequately repaired, it may prevent the cell from surviving or reproducing, or it may
result in a viable but modified cell. These two outcomes have very different implications for the
organism as a whole.
A3.2. Risk of Deterministic Effects. Most organs and tissues of the body are unaffected by the
loss of even a substantial number of cells following irradiation, but if the number lost is large
enough, there will be observable harm resulting in a loss of tissue function. Such effects require a
―threshold‖ radiation dose to be exceeded before an effect is observed, and generally the severity
of the effect once this threshold is exceeded increases with dose. These ―    deterministic‖ effects
include skin erythema, sterility, opacities of the lens of the eye and depression of the blood
forming process. The effects may occur early, within hours or days following exposure; or late,
occurring months or years after exposure. The Table A3.1 summarizes the threshold doses of
observed deterministic effects.

A3.3. Risk of Neoplasia and Hereditary Effects. For cells that have been altered or modified
and can still reproduce, the potential outcomes are very different. Despite highly effective
defense mechanisms, the reproduction of radiation-modified cells may result, after a prolonged
and variable delay called the latency period, in the manifestation of a malignant condition or
cancer. The probability of cancer usually increases with increments in dose, probably with no
threshold, and in a way that is roughly proportional to dose, at least for doses well below the
thresholds for deterministic effects. For the purposes of radiation protection, the risk of
stochastic effects is assumed proportional to dose without threshold, this is also referred to as the
linear-no threshold hypothesis. The severity of cancer is not affected by dose. This kind of affect
if is called ―
             stochastic‖ in that it is random or of a statistical nature. If the damage occurs in a cell
whose function is to transmit genetic information to later generations (i.e., sperm or ovum), any
resulting effects, which may be of many different kinds and severity, are expressed in the
progeny of the exposed individual. This type of stochastic effect is called ―         hereditary‖. The
nominal risks for radiation induced fatal cancers for the general population are given in Table
A3.2 In addition, non-fatal cancers occur. Therefore, typical ratios for total cancers (fatal plus
non-fatal) are given in Table A3.2 Note that these values should not be used to interpret
individual risks, which are dependent on numerous factors such as age, sex, heredity and
environment.

ICRP Publication 53, Radiation Dose to Patients from Radiopharmaceuticals, and a Summary
of the Current ICRP Principles for Protection of the Patient in Diagnostic Radiology), May,
1993.
d. For infants and children, the nominal risk is likely 2-3 times higher than 50x10-6. For adults
over 50 at the time of exposure, the risk is 5-10 times less. e. A doubling dose of 1 Gy (100 rad)
is assumed.

A3.4. Effects Following Irradiation In-Utero. The potential effects on the conceptus
following irradiation depend on the time of irradiation relative to conception. When the number
of cells in the conceptus is small, and their nature is not yet specialized, the effect of damage to
these cells is likely a failure to implant or the undetectable death of the conceptus. Irradiation in
the first three weeks following conception is not likely to result in deterministic or stochastic
effects in the live-born child, despite the heart and central nervous system development in the
third week. During the rest of the period of organogenesis, malformations may be caused in the
organ(s) under development at the time of irradiation. These effects are deterministic in nature,
with a threshold estimated to be 0.1 Gy (10 rad). Two additional effects of irradiation on the
developing fetus include severe mental retardation and cancers that may develop in childhood or
in adult life. The periods of sensitivity after conception for these described effects is summarized
in Table A3.3

b. Malformations of organs appears to be deterministic effect, with a threshold dose in man,
estimated from animal experiments to be 0.1 Gy.
c. The risk of severe mental retardation is associated with an observed shift in IQ of 30 IQ units
per Sv to the brain during the 8th through 15th week after conception, with lesser shifts from the
  th
16 through 25th week). At absorbed doses on the order of 0.1 Sv, no effect would be detectable in
the general distribution of IQ in an irradiated group.

d. The risk of fatal cancers expressed in childhood or in adult life for individuals irradiated in
utero may be similar to the risk of individuals irradiated in the first decade of life, which is
somewhat larger than that for the population as a whole.

2. The limits apply to the sum of relevant doses from external exposure in a period of 1 calendar
year and the 50-year committed dose from intakes in the same period.
3. The mSv is the preferred unit of dose for radiation protection purposes. Current USAF
instrumentation uses the Gy or R as their basic unit of measure, and the MRER reports doses in
rem. For low LET penetrating radiations (x-rays, gamma rays), the following conversions can be
applied:
10 mSv = 1 cSv ≈ 1 cGy =10 mGy = 1 rad ≈ 1 R.
4. Conditions for Minors: No person under the age of 16 years shall be subjected to occupational
exposure, and no person under the age of 18 shall be allowed to work in a restricted area unless
supervised, and then only for the purposes of training
5. In special circumstances, an effective dose of up to 5 mSv in a single year, provided the
average over five years does not exceed 1 mSv per year. AFMSA/SG3PB shall be contacted to
obtain this variance.
6. Averaged over 1 cm2, regardless of the area exposed.

NOTES:
1. This table is extracted from NRC Reg Guide 1.86. The values in this table apply to radioactive
contamination deposited on, but not incorporated into the interior of, the contaminated item.
Where surface contamination by both alpha- and beta-gamma-emitting nuclides exists, apply the
limits established for alpha- and beta-gamma-emitting nuclides independently.
2. As used in this table, dpm (disintegrations per minute) means the rate of emission by
radioactive material as determined by correcting the counts per minute observed by an
appropriate detector for background, efficiency, and geometric factors associated with the
instrumentation.
3. The amount of removable radioactive material per 100 cm2 of surface area should be
determined by swiping the area with dry filter or soft absorbent paper, applying moderate
pressure, and then assessing the amount of radioactive material on the swipe with an appropriate
instrument of known efficiency. (Note: The use of dry material may not be appropriate for
tritium.) When removable contamination on objects of surface area less than 100 cm2 is
determined, the activity per unit area should be based on the actual area and the entire surface
should be wiped. Except for transuranics and 228Ra, 227Ac, 228Th, 230Th, 231Pa and alpha
emitters, it is not necessary to use swiping techniques to measure removable contamination
levels if direct scan surveys indicate that the total residual surface contamination levels are
within the limits for removable contamination.
4. The levels may be averaged over one square meter provided the maximum surface activity in
any area of 100 cm2 is less than three times the value specified. For purposes of averaging, any
square meter of surface shall be considered to be above the activity guide G if: (1) From
measurements of a representative number n of sections it is deter- mined that, where Si is the

dpm/100 cm2 determined from measurement of section i; or (2) it is determined that the sum of
the activity of all isolated spots or particles in any 100 cm2 area exceeds 3G.
5. This category of radionuclides includes mixed fission products, including the 90Sr which is
present in them. It does not apply to 90Sr which has been separated from the other fission
products or mixtures where the 90Sr has been enriched.
6. The average and maximum radiation levels associated with surface contamination resulting
from beta and gamma emitting nuclides should not exceed 2 µGy/hr (0.2 mrad/hr) at 1 cm and
1.0 mrad/hr at 1 cm, respectively, measured through 7 milligrams per square centimeter of total
absorber.

2. GILs are difficult to apply in an emergency since because they cannot be promptly
measured in the field and do not address facility or environmental conditions. However, they
could be used to develop, as part of planning, operational intervention levels (OILs). These can
easily be measured during an emergency e.g., ambient dose rate in plume or from deposition,
marker radionuclide concentration in deposition or foodstuff and on which the need for protective
action can be rapidly ascertained. The values provided were derived for a large nuclear reactor
accident.

NOTES:
1. The use of the measurement millisieverts (mSv) is preferred in all cases. For low LET, whole
body irradiation (x-rays, gamma rays): 1 cGy =10 mGy = 1 rad ≈ 10 mSv ≈ 1 R.
2. All doses should be kept ALARA. This will reduce individual risk as well as retain maximum
operational flexibility for future employment of exposed personnel.
3. Examples of priority tasks are missions to avert danger to persons or to prevent further
damage.

4. Examples of critical tasks are those missions to save lives.
5. This is in addition to the 1:5 and 1:4 incidence of fatal cancer among the general population.
Increased risk is given for induction of fatal cancer. Total lifetime risk is assumed to be 4 – 7
percent per ~1,000 mSv (100 rad). It must be recognized that higher radiation dose rates produce
proportionally more health risks than the same total dose given over longer periods of time.
6. NATO STANAG 2083, Commander’s Guide on Nuclear Radiation Exposure of Groups,
states 125 cGy (125 rad) as the commander’s upper dose limit.
