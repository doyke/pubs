  This Instruction identifies the Headquarters Air Force (HAF) Resource Management Process and
  implements AFPD 65-6, Budget. It provides guidance for the HAF corporate review process for
  programming, budgeting and financial execution of the HAF portfolio, as well as the office of
  the HAF/RM and HAF/HR for day-to-day control and execution of HAF programs and budgets.
  The HAF Portfolio includes HAF staff activities, designated centrally-managed programs and
  HAF Field Operating Agencies (FOAs). The objective of the HAF Resource Management
  Process is to address resource programming, budget, and execution issues for the entire HAF
  portfolio through a corporate review and approval process to ensure the HAF Portfolio
  effectively competes for resources, and to manage execution issues similar to major commands.
  Additionally, this process will provide for the management of 34,000 manpower positions within
  the HAF Portfolio. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
  publication are maintained in accordance with AFPD 33-3, Information Management and
  AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
  Records      Disposition      Schedule    (RDS)     located   at    https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
  af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. This document defines the roles and responsibilities of the
  HAF/RM and HAF/HR offices, the Program and Budget Review Board (PBRB), the Program
  and Budget Review Group (PBRG), and each HAF two-letter/digit organization with regard to
  resource planning, programming, budgeting and execution. It is drawn from the above guidance
  and AF/CV and AF/CVA memoranda that established the HAF resource management process.
  Throughout this document the term “resources” is inclusive of HAF manpower and dollars. The
  term “manpower” includes manpower, personnel and civilian workyear/manyear execution.
1. HAF Resource Management Process. The HAF Portfolio will be managed within the
constraints of DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation; AFPD 16-5, Planning
Programming and Budgeting System; AFI 65-601 Volume 3, The Air Force Budget Corporate
Process; AFI 16-501 , Control and Documentation of Air Force Programs; AFI 38-101, Air
Force Organization; AFI 38-202, Air Force Management Headquarters and Headquarters
Support Activities; AFI 38-204, Programming USAF Manpower; AFPD 36-5, Civilian Personnel
Resource Management; and AFI 36-502, Managing Civilian Personnel Resources; and other
related policy and appropriate HAF annual planning, budget and/or financial execution guidance.
Figure 1, HAF Resource Management Process, depicts the flow of resource management
information and decisions within the HAF. This process applies to programming, budgeting and
execution within the HAF portfolio. The specific responsibilities and applicable membership of
the HAF organizations, as they relate to the HAF resource management process, are contained in
subsequent paragraphs.




Figure 1 HAF Resource Management Process

Information and tasks to meet the HAF program, budget and manpower suspenses will flow from
HAF/RM or HAF/HR to the HAF two-letter/digit organizations for action. Air Force Elements
will be managed by the HAF two-letter/digits within HAF. HAF two-letter/digits will respond to
tasks for their entire portfolio, including their FOAs for all fund codes. The requested
information flows back into HAF/RM or HAF/HR, which validates the inputs, analyzes the
requirements and integrates them into a “strawman” for the PBRG to develop a draft integrated,
prioritized submission. The PBRG chair shares the approach and accompanying information with
the HAF two-letter/digit organizations that are not members of the PBRG (HAF two-letter/digit
Info-Share meeting) and takes into account their views before presenting the proposed
submission to the PBRB for approval. Once approval is received from the PBRB, HAF/RM or
HAF/HR, as appropriate, will submit the applicable documents to HAF two-letter/digit
organizations and will follow the directed approach and priorities when responding to Air Force
Corporate Structure deliberations or executing programs.

 portfolio. The options should follow the Annual Planning and Programming Guidance, Defense
 Planning Guidance, Air Force Executive Guidance, and consider fiscal constraints. Provide the
 HAF/RM and HAF two-letter/digit organizations with feedback on their activities. Specifically,
 the PBRG will produce the following products for presentation to the PBRB: the HAF POM
 submission; the HAF Execution Plan; and consolidated HAF Portfolio unfunded priorities for
 program and budget cycles. The PBRG will support the PBRB in balancing programs and
 financial resources, consistent with administrative and legal limitations, and Air Force guidance.

 process for the PBRB to review and approve out-of-cycle funding requests. The Chair of the
 PBRG will meet with the HAF two-letter/digit not represented on the PBRG to review the
 PBRG recommendations on all major deliverables or issues before presenting them to the PBRB.

 3.2.2. Authority and Scope. The PBRG meets at the discretion of the Chair for the following

 execution; evaluate priorities within the HAF during programming, budgeting, and execution;
 receive briefings as necessary to make informed decisions on HAF resources and analyze issues
 and programs as directed by the PBRB. The PBRG will oversee all HAF program, budget and
 execution products in route to the PBRB. It will receive information briefings as needed to
 analyze issues and develop alternatives. The PBRG has the authority to direct studies by the
 Headquarters Air Force staff to examine issue alternatives. Although small FOAs and Program
 Element Monitors (PEMs) for centrally managed programs will enter the process through their
 parent HAF two-letter/digit the Group may call on PEMs and FOA representatives for additional
 information regarding requirements and priorities for resources in their program and budget in
 addition to the HAF two-letter/digit.

 3.2.3. Membership. Membership consists of functional experts from Headquarters Air Force
 needed to review the HAF portfolio. At the direction of AF/CV, HAF Principals will designate a
 member, at minimum, colonel or civilian equivalent level. The designee should be familiar with
 the program financial requirements of the functional office represented. Membership is as
 follows: PBRG Chair is the SAF/AA deputy; voting members will be from SAF/AA, SAF/AQ,
 SAF/FM, SAF/IG, SAF/CIO A6, AF/A1, AF/A2, AF/A3/5, AF/A4/7, and AF/A8 with AF/JA as
