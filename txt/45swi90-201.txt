SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been updated to align with AFI 90-201 published August 2013 and AFSPCI
90-201 Sup 1 published January 2013 respectively. The new guidance introduces a new tool:
Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT). MICT training, current instructions and
proposed instructions use self-inspection program (SIP), commanders’ inspection program
(CCIP), and self-assessment program (SAP) interchangeably. This instruction uses SAP to align
with current AFI 90-201.
1. Overview. A self-assessment program (SAP) provides an effective means of assessing
mission performance and organizational effectiveness through internal review. The intent is to
provide commanders with a tool for internal assessment of unit health and to complement
external inspections and assessments. Commanders are SAP customers and therefore dictate the
quality of their SAP. They use SAP results to assess mission readiness and direct resources and
energies to correct deficiencies. An effective SAP requires a dedicated approach at all levels.
     1.1. Program Criteria. A SAP is beneficial if it does the following:
        1.1.1. Assigns SAP responsibilities.
        1.1.2. Is tailored to each unit’s structure and contains mechanisms that ensure adequate
        periodic inspection coverage of the organization’s mission, resources, training and
        personnel programs.
        1.1.3. Establishes a method to identify, document, track and resolve deficiencies.
        1.1.4. Provides feedback to commanders.
        1.1.5. Ensures that all AF, AFSPC, 14 AF, 45 SW checklists are tailored properly and
        are current. Checklists can be found in MICT.
        1.1.6. Establishes a method to crossfeed information relevant to the SAP.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The Commander (45 SW/CC):
        2.1.1. Is the SAP office of primary responsibility (OPR).

instructions are in attachment 3.
6. Inspection Process.
     6.1.1. Each checklist step will be marked with a check in either the “Yes”, “No” or “N/A”
     column. Include a written explanation using complete sentences along with uploaded
     documents supporting the answer to each checklist item. When all applicable checklist steps
     are completed, publish the results and notify the next highest level SAP manager, FAM, or
     additional duty contact in your chain of command.
        6.1.2. If the answer to the checklist question is "Yes," the written explanation and
        documentation must be sufficient to show you are in compliance.
        6.1.3. If the answer to the checklist question is "N/A," there will be sufficient written
        justification to show that this question does not apply.
        6.1.4. If the answer to the checklist question is "No," then there will be an automatic
        discrepancy opened in the MICT database to document the discrepancy. The entry will
        explain the problem and corrective actions being taken.
