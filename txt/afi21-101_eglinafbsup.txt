procedures that are not SAF and proposed revisions/changes to local procedures developed under
this instruction.
19.4. (Added) Developing Local Procedures:
19.4.1. (Added) When a procedure calls for a small amount of deviation to standard procedures,
standard technical data may be used with approval of the 46 MXG Commander or their
designated representatives, with coordination of the JCWG. Prepare requests utilizing e-route
procedures (see Attachment 56 for guidance). The e-route will have coordination of all members
of the JCWG. All Local Tech Data will be routed thru the Armament Configuration Manager for
review, excluding M-series. Additionally, for all deviations involving aircraft armament
functions, Wing Weapons Manager (46 MXG/MXW) will coordinate on the e-route prior to the
commander's signature.
19.4.1.1. (Added) The armament configuration manager or munitions flight line delivery (as
applicable) prepares draft technical data (see respective attachments for appropriate format) and
requests a meeting of the JCWG. The draft technical data will use the style and layout of
standard procedures that most resemble users needs (i.e., checklists, work cards, or job guides).
19.4.1.2. (Added) Draft technical procedures will be used only when Quality Assurance, Safety,
Munitions Flight (if applicable), and Weapons Standardization Section (if applicable) are
notified/present.
19.4.1.3. (Added) All procedures particular to the test (such as aircraft preparation, loading,
transporting, or inspecting) must be addressed in the local procedures and have the capability to
AFI 21-101_EGLINAFBSUP                                                                       77

stand-alone. DOD technical data will not have procedures for new test items. Job guides may
refer to aircraft safe for maintenance. Loading checklists may refer to the basic technical
manual. At no time will draft procedures be used on flight missions.
19.4.1.4. (Added) The JCWG will terminate the verification process if a system problem is
identified. The process will not resume until the discrepancy has been isolated and corrective
action taken. If a determination is made that local procedures are incorrect or that software
problems exist, then changes may be made by engineering personnel and the verification process
continued. The verification process will be terminated if a determination cannot be made by the
appropriate contractor, engineer or equipment specialist. Hardware problems will be corrected
by the owning maintenance organization.
19.4.1.5. (Added) The armament configuration manager (as applicable) will ensure the local
technical data is typed in the required format and e-routed through proper channels for
signatures. Allow 5 duty days for the routing process. Each office must expeditiously process
the local technical data and e-route (courtesy copy the armament configuration manager) to the
next office without delay. If extensive changes are required, the number of days needed for
routing may be extended.
19.4.1.6. (Added) The JCWG will coordinate through e-mail or reconvene when necessary to
review the final product prior to it being sent for signature by the authorized approving official.
19.4.1.7. (Added) At times, deviations to SAF technical data may be required to test feasibility of
a permanent change, or alternate method (i.e., rerouting arming wire, step in an operational
check or tie-down procedure due to a fault discovered during standard operations). Submit by e-
mail to the JCWG, any requirement for deviation from SAF technical data to support a particular
short-notice, one-flight/event request. The intent of this one-event process is to correct a conflict
with SAF technical data and not to support a project or continual test.
19.4.1.8. (Added) The project officer for that mission may accomplish deviations from local
checklists with verbal approval from the JCWG chairman. In addition, the deviation will be
documented in the aircraft forms with an INFO write-up and signed by the project officer. The
intent of this one-event process is to correct a problem with the local checklist and not to support
a continual project or test. Deviations in support of a test/project will require a formal change.
19.4.2. (Added) Revising/Changing/Reviewing Local Procedures: If unsafe, incorrect, or
confusing steps are found in any locally developed procedure, STOP THE OPERATION
IMMEDIATELY, notify Quality Assurance and the OPR of the test project. Operations will not
resume until corrective actions are taken or the respective approving official has authorized
deviations.
19.4.2.1. (Added) The JCWG and respective approving official or designated representative must
approve changes/supplements to verified local technical data. Anyone may submit a change to
46th Maintenance Group Quality Assurance Flight (46 MXG/MXQI) or 46th Maintenance
Group Weapons Management/Standardization (46 MXG/MXWL). The following pages, as a
minimum, will be forwarded for review: title page, (A) page and affected pages. The change
number and date will be placed at the bottom of each page (see appropriate attachment). For
changes to contractor data, forward one copy of changed pages to QA for verification according
to this instruction. These pages will update the master file copy.
78                                                               AFI21-101_EGLINAFBSUP

19.4.2.2. (Added) The test engineer, project officer or their representative must brief the
performing work center on the affected changes of approved formal technical data prior to the
next scheduled mission.
19.4.2.3. (Added) Numerical, typographical, keyword, JON number and punctuation changes
may be accomplished in pen-and-ink (with date and initials) without approval of the JCWG;
however, they must not change the technical meaning or procedure. Pen-and-ink changes will be
briefed to all users prior to the next scheduled mission. Quality Assurance will be notified in
writing of pen-and-ink changes and update the master copy.
19.4.3. (Added) Rescinding Local Technical Data: The developing or procuring agency will
inform Quality Assurance in writing when the locally verified procedures are no longer required.
Quality Assurance will inform all using organizations of the rescinded, locally developed
procedures. Reuse of contractor data will be required for re-verification prior to being
authorized for use. When tests or locally produced procedures become incorporated into SAF
technical data, the local technical data will be rescinded and no longer authorized.
19.4.4. (Added) The following guidance and requirements will be used in conjunction with the
corresponding attachments (for illustration purposes only) to develop the appropriate local
checklist, job guide or work card. Weapons loading checklist requirements:
19.4.4.1. (Added) Figures and diagrams may be used to help clarify procedures.
19.4.4.2. (Added) To have an effective checklist, use an SAF checklist that best resembles your
test munition or loading procedures and follow that format.
19.4.4.3. (Added) Whenever practical, use pre-fuzed munitions. This will reduce the size of your
checklist.
19.4.4.4. (Added) Checklist will be typed on 11 by 8.5 inch bond paper and have margins set so
the text lines do not exceed 5.0 inches wide and 7.5 inches long, with font style “Times New
Roman,” 10-point font size. This will allow the final product to be placed in a plastic checklist
envelope.
19.4.4.5. (Added) All major headings are to be started on a new page and will be identified with
BOLD UNDERLINED PRINT; subheadings are identified with just BOLD PRINT. The
format in Attachment 52 uses the F-16 as an example, but is applicable for all mission, design
and series (MDS) aircraft.
19.4.5. (Added) Local Job Guide Requirements:
19.4.5.1. (Added) Figures and diagrams may be used to help clarify procedures.
19.4.5.2. (Added) Use a SAF job guide that best resembles the test Pod/AME/ECM and follow
that format for a more effective job guide.
19.4.5.3. (Added) The job guide will be typed on 11 by 8.5 inch bond paper and have margins set
so the text lines do not exceed 5.0 inches wide and 7.5 inches long, with font style “Times New
Roman,” 10-point font size. This will allow the final product to be placed in a plastic job guide
envelope.
19.4.5.4. (Added) All major functions/tasks are to be started on a new page and will be identified
with BOLD UNDERLINED PRINT; subheadings are identified with just BOLD PRINT. Use
the format in Attachment 53 as an example in preparing local job guides.
AFI 21-101_EGLINAFBSUP                                                                      79

19.4.5.5. (Added) Standard functions/tasks in support of a system or component that is
published in a SAF job guide and does not require any special modifications may be referenced
to that specific job guide’s subfunction/task (i.e., perform installation of ECM Pod adapter: JG-
99-21-01). A local job guide will be developed with the input conditions, function/task and
follow-on maintenance.
19.4.5.6. (Added) A function is made up of a task or series of tasks supporting a system or
component. A function supporting a component gives all tasks required to support that
component. Typical function headings are INTRODUCTION, GENERAL MAINTENANCE,
ITEM PREPARATION, AIRCRAFT PREPARATION, ADAPTER AND SUPPORT
EQUIPMENT CONFIGURATION, OPERATIONAL CHECKOUT, REMOVAL and
INSTALLATION, etc. All tasks within a function must stand alone and must be done to
complete the function.
19.4.5.7. (Added) Input Conditions: The input conditions will be at the start of each function.
Each input condition will list information on the APPLICABILITY, REQUIRED
CONDITIONS, PERSONNEL RECOMMENDED and SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. List
references to prepare the aircraft for maintenance, the recommended number of personnel to
complete the task, special tools and equipment required to complete the task and any other
needed requirements.
19.4.5.8. (Added) Function/Task Arrangement: A local job guide will provide a complete set of
step-by-step procedures and will stand alone for all test item preparation, removal and
installation instructions. The local job guide will be used in conjunction with approved Air
Force safe for maintenance job guides. When major discrepancies or problems are identified,
cease all operations and notify Quality Assurance.
19.4.5.9. (Added) Follow-on Maintenance: All steps listed under follow-on maintenance must be
accomplished when the tasks required for a given function have been completed. Follow-on
maintenance technical reference must be listed in the local job guide.
19.4.6. (Added) Local Munitions Test Positioning and Tie-Down Procedure Requirements:
19.4.6.1. (Added) Figures and diagrams may be used to help clarify procedures.
19.4.6.2. (Added) To have effective technical data, use a SAF technical manual that best
resembles the test munitions and follow that format.
19.4.6.3. (Added) The data will be typed on 11 by 8.5 inch bond paper and have margins set so
the text lines do not exceed 5.0 inches in width and 7.5 inches in length, with font style “Times
New Roman,” and a 10-point font size.
19.4.6.4. (Added) All major functions/tasks are identified with BOLD PRINT. Use the format
in Attachment 54 as an example in preparing local work cards.
19.4.6.5. (Added) Standard functions/tasks in support of a system or component that are
published in a SAF publication that do not require special modifications may be referenced to
that specific subfunction/task (e.g., perform specific safety requirements in TO 11-1-38).
19.4.6.6. (Added) A test positioning and tie-down procedure will provide a complete set of
procedures and will stand alone for all test item positioning and tie-down. When major
discrepancies or problems are identified, cease operations and notify Quality Assurance.

19.4.7. (Added) Local Aircraft Work Card Requirements:
19.4.7.1. (Added) Local aircraft work cards are authorized in accordance with TO 00-5-1 and
AFMC Supp 1 to AFI 21-101. Quality Assurance is responsible for the technical content and the
semiannual validation of all local technical data. The local work cards (LWC) must comply with
all technical data procedures must not introduce any unsafe procedures and must not create a
requirement for additional tools or test equipment. In cases where an LWC requires additional
tools or test equipment, it must be waived by the MXG/CC.
19.4.7.2. (Added) Anyone may initiate an LWC, after coordination through his or her supervisor.
QA will review the suggested procedures for validity and content.
19.4.7.3. (Added) LWCs are typed on an AFTO Form 26, Aircraft Inspection Work Document.
The LWC monitor in QA maintains a template.
19.4.7.4. (Added) A list of effective LWCs will be placed directly behind the TO title page. The
LWC will be placed directly behind the affected page in the TO. The page number of the LWC
and the page it affects should have the same number.
