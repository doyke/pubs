Section A—Safety Program Management

1. Introduction. This instruction is a collaboration between the 3 WG Safety Office (3
WG/SE), 176 WG Safety Office (176 WG/SE), 673 ABW Safety Office (673 ABW/SE), 477 FG
Safety Office (477 FG/SE) and other tenant/associate safety offices on JBER. Ground, weapons,
and flight safety responsibilities are prescribed by this instruction and specific guidance is given
as to which office will maintain primary responsibility.
2. Unit Safety Program Management. Unit commanders will appoint, in writing, primary and
alternate Ground Safety Representatives (GSR), Flight Safety Representative (FSR), and
Weapons Safety Representative (WSR) as appropriate, in the grade of TSgt (or civilian
equivalent) or higher to manage their safety program. If sufficient personnel are not available,
then careful and deliberate consideration must be given to the appointment of E-5 or below as the
safety representative. Safety representatives below the rank of E-6 must be endorsed by the
appropriate group commander.          Associated units may rely on their host unit safety
representatives and programs to meet requirements of this instruction unless otherwise stated.
Member’s of associated Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units may be appointed as
alternate unit safety representatives (USR) (GSR, FSR or WSR), when appropriate, and agreed
upon by both associated unit commanders. The appointed Safety Representative should have the
experience, maturity, and presumed authority to speak on the commander’s behalf. The term
USR will be used when responsibilities can be fulfilled by any or all unit safety representatives.
The 477 FG will appoint one primary Ground Safety Representative. Commanders of squadrons
subordinate to the 477 FG that are not associated with 3 WG or 673 ABW will appoint USRs.
3. FSR and WSR. The FSR and WSR will serve as the primary point of contact for the 3 WG
(for flight and weapons safety related issues) and GSR will serve as the primary point of contact
for the 673 ABW Safety Office (for ground safety related issues) on all matters related to safety,
fire prevention, and health in the unit. Unit safety representatives should be knowledgeable in
the mission and activities of the unit, and have a minimum of one year retain ability until their
date expected to return from overseas (DEROS) at the time of selection. Primary and alternate
ground safety USRs will receive training from the 673 ABW Safety Office within 30 days of
appointment. The appointment and training of safety personnel below squadron level (for
example, branch and/or section) is the responsibility of the squadron commander and USR.
     3.1. The duties of a USR are significant, and depending on the dynamics of each individual
     unit, USR responsibilities can consume a significant amount of time. Commanders and
     supervisors will allow USRs sufficient time to fully perform all assigned USR
     responsibilities, and to attend monthly meetings and training.
     3.2. Ensure personnel at all levels are held accountable for compliance with safety
     requirements.

Section B—Mishap Reporting Procedures

4. Unit Commanders and USRs. Unit commanders and USRs are responsible for developing
and publicizing mishap notification procedures within their unit. These procedures must be
posted on the unit safety bulletin board and ensure prompt notification. Co-located associated
units will rely on host unit USRs to manage safety bulletin boards and overall safety programs.
JBELEMDORF-RICHARDSONI91-202 30 MAY 2012                                                        7


They are not required to have separate USRs or programs unless deemed necessary by the
associated unit commander.
5. On-Duty Mishaps. On-duty mishaps are reported by the supervisor through the USR to the
appropriate Wing Safety Office immediately (24 hours a day) following notification of
appropriate first response agency (fire, rescue, medical, or law enforcement agencies). On-duty
mishaps include military and civilian injuries, Air Force motor vehicle accidents (regardless of
whether or not the mishap involved injury), damage to Air Force property, and injury and/or
damage caused by an Air Force operation. The scene of any mishap involving Air Force
property or an injury where the individual was transported for medical treatment will not be
released until the appropriate safety investigator deems it ready. The safety investigator has the
authority to release the scene telephonically depending on the circumstances and nature of the
incident. Associate units must develop mishap reporting procedures to ensure the unit
commander, USR, and the appropriate Wing Safety office are notified of all mishaps. The Wing
Safety office will investigate Class D and C mishaps for all associate units without a full time
safety professional assigned unless the associate unit’s headquarters convening authority requests
otherwise.
6. Off-Duty Mishaps. Off-duty mishaps (military injuries only) are reported by the individual
through the supervisor, to the USR (or commander), in-person or by positive telephone contact.
The USR or commander will notify the Wing Safety Office by the close of the first duty day
following the mishap. With the exception of significant incidents discussed below, e-mail to the
673 ABW/SEG organizational inbox is preferred (673abw.seg@elmendorf.af.mil). Initial
notification will include name, date of mishap, location, brief synopsis of mishap and medical
treatment received pending receipt of PACAF Form 161, Notification of Mishap.
7. . Mishaps Resulting in Death/Hospitalization. All mishaps resulting in death, or
hospitalization, as well as all on-duty mishaps resulting in medical treatment or damage in excess
of $20,000 must be immediately reported through positive contact (no voicemail or e-mail) to the
673 ABW Safety Office in person or by telephone at 907-230-4297.
8. Alaska Air National Guard (AKANG). Will report mishaps directly to their supervisor and
AKANG safety office. The AKANG Safety Office shall forward this information in accordance
with National Guard Bureau policies and directives and courtesy copy the 673 ABW Safety
Office.
9. After Normal Duty Hours. After normal duty hours, the safety office on-call representative
can be reached through the 673 ABW Command Post at 552-3000.
10. Immediate Reporting. The immediate reporting of any mishap is critical. Accident sites
contain valuable information necessary for accurate investigation and mishap prevention. When
a mishap occurs on duty that requires the preservation of evidence, the supervisor, USR,
Commander, or quality assurance (QA) will secure the mishap site until safety personnel arrive.
If there is any question as to if preservation of evidence is needed, contact the appropriate Wing
Safety Office and it will be handled on a case by case basis.
   10.1. The first line supervisor will document all mishaps on PACAF Form 161, Notification
   of Mishap, ensuring all applicable blocks are filled in. The USR will then complete his/her
   section and forward it to the 673 ABW Safety Office organizational inbox. Final signed
   copies will be hand carried or emailed to 673 ABW Safety Office organizational inbox
