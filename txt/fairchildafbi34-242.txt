 2                                                   FAIRCHILDAFBI34-242 7 MARCH 2014


1. General Information: The primary mission of the Fairchild AFB BHG is to provide well-
trained, highly professional members to honor and carry out the primary mission of rendering
military funeral honors. The compositions of military funeral honors are required by law that is
cited in Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 1300.15, Military Funeral Support. Upon
request, the BHG will ensure that a funeral honors ceremony is provided for all eligible
members. The area of responsibility (AOR) encompasses 30 counties, approximately 61,000
square miles in a geographical area, extends to Eastern Washington, Northern Idaho, and
Northwestern Oregon. This includes supporting McChord Field BHG in conducting Military
Funeral Honors (MFH) at locations inaccessible due to weather conditions during winter season.
     1.1. The military funeral mission takes precedence over ceremonial functions. However,
     time and resources permitting, the BHG will also support protocol and ceremonial functions
     in the following order of priority:
        1.1.1. Retirement Ceremony for military personnel
        1.1.2. Change of Command Ceremony
        1.1.3. Wing Prisoner of War/Missing in Action Ceremony
        1.1.4. Wing Annual Awards Banquet
        1.1.5. Wing and Group Dining In/Out
        1.1.6. Other Wing and Group sponsored events
        1.1.7. Retirement Ceremony for civilian personnel
        1.1.8. All other local community events, such as the Lilac and Bloomsday Parades
     1.2. Given the importance of the BHG mission, a quota-based system will be used to ensure
     adequate manning is available to render honors. The BHG will consist of 23 full-time
     members per tour and serve as their official duty location. Quotas shall be assigned to each
     active duty Group residing on Fairchild AFB and should be viewed as minimum levels
     expected from each function (Attachment 2).
        1.2.1. Quotas are based on the enlisted strength of E-5 and below using authorized,
        funded positions on the Unit Manning Documents (UMD) and will be reviewed and
        reallocated annually.
        1.2.2. Company Grade Officers and E-6 and above manning are not counted toward unit
        allocations, but they may still volunteer. Group Commanders may adjust the numbers
        within their organizations to ensure a balance as long as the overall quota for the Group is
        met. Groups and squadrons are allowed and encouraged to exceed their quotas. Any
        request to decrease a unit’s BHG quota must be approved by the 92d Air Refueling Wing
        (ARW)/Commander (CC).
2. Tour of Duty.
     2.1. The minimum BHG commitment is a four and a half month tour. This will provide
     Airmen and supervisors greater predictability and stability while ensuring trained and ready
     cadre needed to support requirements.
        2.1.1. Selected members will report directly to the BHG as their primary duty section
        while assigned. To prevent degradation of the BHG mission, all appointments, leave and
FAIRCHILDAFBI34-242 7 MARCH 2014                                                             3


      AF Skill-related training will be coordinated though the BHG Non Commissioned
      Officer in Charge (NCOIC).
   2.2. As a member of the BHG, the individual is required to maintain the highest standards of
   military bearing, dress and appearance, behavior and attitude both on-and-off duty. Under
   the discretion of the 92d Force Support Squadron (FSS)/CC, members failing to comply with
   these instructions may be removed from the BHG. In the event that an individual is
   “removed” before completing their commitment, it automatically negates consideration for
   any awards and decorations. The applicable Group and Squadron Commander must provide
   a replacement if a BHG member is removed. The member will return his/her entire uniform
   and/or repay the 92 FSS for all issued uniform items.
   2.3. Typically, BHG members will not be released before their tour ends.         Exceptions
   include:
      2.3.1. A unit replaces a non-volunteer member with a volunteer from his/her unit.
      2.3.2. The member receives an assignment. If this happens, the unit will be required to
      provide a replacement within 60 days of assignment notification.
      2.3.3. The member receives Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) punishment.
      2.3.4. The 92 FSS Operations Officer (FSO) and BHG NCOIC will be notified
      immediately by the Squadron’s First Sergeant if a member is no longer fit to be a BHG
      member. Final dismissal of the member rests with his/her Commander, Chief and First
      Sergeant.
3. Nomination Procedures and Screenings.
