AFRCI20-111 5 APRIL 2011                                                                        9


   4.5.5. Facilities and Equipment Condition. Supervisors at all levels are required to ensure
   adequate facilities and equipment required to accomplish the mission are available and
   properly maintained. Commanders are responsible for identifying facility and equipment
   conditions and shortfalls that impact mission accomplishment to the appropriate
   agency/higher headquarters.
   4.5.6. Asset Accountability. Personnel at all levels are responsible for ensuring the proper
   accountability of tools, materiel, equipment, and weapons. This includes ensuring Positive
   Inventory Control (PIC) of Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel (NWRM), Nuclear Certified
   Equipment (NCE), classified assets, CCI/COMSEC, equipment, serialized control items,
   small arms, conventional munitions, and sensitive related materiel. It includes ensuring that
   accurate data is reflected for the materiel in appropriate functional information management
   systems.
4.6. LEAP Methodology. The LEAP will be conducted through the use of evaluations,
inspections and observations. Any failed evaluation or inspection is considered a discrepancy
and will be identified as major or minor based on Table A3.2.
   4.6.1. Evaluations. Represent the direct evaluation of a logistics action, inspection, or
   training conducted/performed by an individual or team. Evaluations are used to evaluate job
   proficiency, degree of training, and compliance with technical data or instructions. Any
   individual performing, supervising, or evaluating logistics tasks is subject to a direct
   evaluation. LEAT personnel performing evaluations must have sufficient subject matter
   expertise to properly and safely conduct the evaluation. Refer to Attachment 3 for specific
   procedures on conducting and rating evaluations. Evaluations include:
       4.6.1.1. Personnel Evaluations (PE). A PE is the direct evaluation of an individual or
       team conducting/performing a logistics action. PEs may be conducted on task-oriented
       functions such as equipment maintenance as well as process-oriented functions such as
       vehicle dispatch.
       4.6.1.2. Evaluator Proficiency Evaluations (EPE). An EPE is the direct evaluation of a
       Quality Assurance (QA) individual or any individual performing a quality/compliance
       assurance function in a unit.
       4.6.1.3. Trainer Proficiency Evaluations (TPE). A TPE is the direct evaluation of a unit
       instructor/trainer to determine their ability to teach accurately and sufficiently. TPEs
       also assess weapon system, equipment or process knowledge; teaching methods and
       techniques; the ability to operate trainers; and adequacy and effectiveness of training
       programs. Any individual training personnel on a task or process is subject to a TPE.
   4.6.2. Inspections. Represent inspections of equipment and processes to ensure compliance
   with established standards. Inspections are rated as “Pass” or “Fail”.
       4.6.2.1. Quality Verification Inspection (QVI). A QVI is an inspection of equipment
       condition or a process after an inspection, repair action, or process has been completed by
       a technician or supervisor to assess if it was properly completed. The QVI finding should
       reflect deficiencies by the individual who accomplished the task and identify specific
       discrepancies.
 10                                                               AFRCI20-111 5 APRIL 2011


       4.6.2.2. Special Inspections (SI). SIs are inspections not covered by QVIs or Evaluations
       and may include, but are not limited to, inspections of: aircraft and equipment forms,
       document control procedures and file plans, consolidated tool kits, inventory controls, TO
       files, vehicle inspections, program management items, housekeeping, safety practices,
       and other interest items identified by HQ AFRC/A4. SIs may be compliance or
       proficiency oriented.
   4.6.3. Observations. Represents observed events or conditions with safety or security
   implications or technical violations not related to an evaluation that are considered unsafe,
   not in accordance with established procedures, or in the case of equipment, unfit to operate.
       4.6.3.1. Detected Safety Violation (DSV). A DSV is an observed unsafe act by an
       individual. The LEAT evaluator must stop the unsafe act immediately. Do not document
       a separate DSV on an individual undergoing a direct evaluation since the unsafe act
       automatically results in a “Fail” rating. Annotate the failure with “Safety” when a safety
       violation is committed during an evaluation.
       4.6.3.2. Technical Data Violation (TDV). A TDV is an observation of any person
       performing maintenance or another logistics process without the required technical data
       present at the job site and in use. The technician must have knowledge of all general
       directives associated with the job prior to performing the task. However, these directives
       do not need to be present at the job site. Do not document a separate TDV on an
       individual undergoing a direct evaluation since failure to use technical data automatically
       results in a “Fail” rating. Annotate the failure with “Tech Data” when a TDV is
       committed during an evaluation.
       4.6.3.3. Unsatisfactory Condition Report (UCR). A UCR is an unsafe, unsecure or
       unsatisfactory condition, other than a DSV, chargeable to supervision. UCRs will be
       documented even when it is not possible to determine who created the condition.
4.7. Findings/Discrepancies. A discrepancy is defined as a failed logistics event. A finding is
defined as a failed logistics event or collection of events that requires oversight by senior
leadership. The LEAP Team Chief will determine if a single discrepancy or collection of
discrepancies will be classified as a finding.
4.8. Contractor Managed Organizations. Contracted units performing logistics functions
present unique challenges for conducting LEAP evaluations. The following procedures will be
followed for Contractor Managed Organizations:
   4.8.1. If the provisions of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) or Performance Plan (P-
   Plan) allow for higher headquarters direct evaluation (i.e., on-site observation by evaluators)
   of the contracted organization, then the LEAP evaluation shall be conducted in conjunction
   with the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) in accordance with the guidance
   contained in this instruction and governing Quality Assurance directives. NOTE: For the
   purpose of this instruction, COR is synonymous with Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE)
   and Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR).
       4.8.1.1. LEAP evaluators conducting direct evaluation of the contracted organization
       must be properly trained in QAE functions and must coordinate closely with the COR on
       all aspects of the evaluation.
AFRCI20-111 5 APRIL 2011                                                                      11


   4.8.2. If direct evaluation of the contractor managed organization is not permitted by the
   PWS or P- Plan, then the LEAT will follow the below guidance.
      4.8.2.1. Evaluate the contractor’s performance by conducting a joint surveillance with
      the COR and/or examining the COR documentation as compared to the Quality
      Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) or P-Plan for that contract.
      4.8.2.2. Evaluate that the COR is providing effective oversight of the contract by
      ensuring that the QASP or P-Plan is being followed as written, that the multifunctional
      team periodically reviews the plan and initiates modifications to the plan when needed,
      and that it adheres to applicable governing directives.
      4.8.2.3. Evaluate the PWS requirements and service summary objectives against the
      organizational objectives to ensure they are adequately written to satisfy mission
      requirements.
      4.8.2.4. Ensure the Contracting Officer and COR review findings/discrepancies
      associated with contractor performance prior to inclusion in the LEAP Unit Report.
      NOTE: Only the Contracting Officer can take formal action against the contractor for
      non-compliance or direct contractors to correct deficiencies identified during evaluations.
4.9. Logistics Interest Items (LIIs). The LEAT will run all current LIIs during unit LEAP
evaluations. The results of these LIIs will be put in the LEAP Unit Report.
 12                                                              AFRCI20-111 5 APRIL 2011

                              EVALUATION PROCEDURES

A3.1. General Evaluation Guidance.           The procedures in this attachment apply to all
evaluations.
   A3.1.1. Evaluators can conduct evaluations on any personnel who perform, supervise,
   inspect, evaluate, instruct, or train a logistics task.
   A3.1.2. The term “technician/team” used in this attachment includes personnel who are
   supervisors, evaluators, trainers, and inspectors. It also includes personnel who instruct a
   technical task involving on-equipment task performances governed by a technical data
   training reference.
   A3.1.3. Evaluations will encompass tool usage, general maintenance practices, technical
   data usage, conduct of logistics processes, adherence to instructions/manuals/directives, etc.
   A3.1.4. Evaluators may conduct an evaluation while using training items or in training
   facilities.
   A3.1.5. To the maximum extent possible, before conducting an evaluation, evaluators must
   verify the technician/team under evaluation is task certified in their Training Business Area
   (TBA) or CFETP(s). This verification must be completed before the final grade is validated.
   A3.1.6. When selecting tasks for evaluation, evaluators must ensure they evaluate a variety
   of tasks involving different equipment and/or different actions for each technician/team. In
   addition, they must ensure evaluations cover various systems for which a unit is qualified.
   A3.1.7. To the maximum extent possible, evaluators will have their own copy of technical
   data/instructions available for the task being evaluated. If unavailable, the evaluator will
   confirm the currency of the technical data/instructions used to accomplish the task.
   A3.1.8. Evaluations will only be accomplished during actual task performance or while
   inspecting equipment or documentation. Evaluators will not participate in the task being
   performed.
   A3.1.9. Evaluators must afford every reasonable opportunity for technicians/teams to detect
   a defect or deficiency.
A3.2. Evaluation Briefing. Before starting an evaluation, the evaluator will conduct a briefing
with the technician/team. During the briefing, the evaluator must advise the technician/team of
the following:
   A3.2.1. The evaluation starts when the technician/team begins the task, or portion of the task
   to be evaluated, and is completed when the entire task or previously determined portion of
   the task is finished. For tasks already in progress, the evaluator will notify the
   technician/team they are under evaluation and brief them as soon as practical.
   A3.2.2. All logistics actions performed are subject to evaluation.
   A3.2.3. Safety and security should not be compromised for any reason.
   A3.2.4. All detected errors during the evaluation will be used to calculate an overall award
   of “Pass” or “Fail”.
 20                                                               AFRCI20-111 5 APRIL 2011


   A3.2.5. The technician/team can request permission from the evaluator to take short breaks.
   The evaluator will use professional discretion to approve or disapprove the request.
   A3.2.6. The technician/team must notify the evaluator of applicable information that could
   affect the task evaluation.        This includes any Previously Complied With (PCW)
   task(s)/step(s). If the technician/team fails to do this, they may be charged with an error for
   requirements that were omitted during the task performance that were not identified as PCW
   prior to the evaluation critique.
   A3.2.7. The evaluator may ask questions to determine technician/team knowledge of the task
   under evaluation. The technician/team may use technical references to answer any questions.
   A3.2.8. The technician/team is responsible for completion of all tasks and related actions.
   The evaluator's presence does not shift this responsibility.
   A3.2.9. The technician/team may ask for technical help from personnel/agencies normally
   available during day-to-day operations. The evaluator will use professional discretion to
   determine if the request and time delay are reasonable.
A3.3. Evaluator Task Performance Actions. During every task evaluation, the evaluator
must detect and correct, to the maximum extent possible, all errors. The evaluator must select the
best option available to correct the situation. It may be advantageous to correct minor errors
during the critique phase; other errors may warrant immediate correction. The evaluator should
consider giving the technician/team the opportunity to make decisions on courses of action on
their own using the resources available to them.
   A3.3.1. All detected errors during the evaluation will be used to calculate an overall grade
   using the criteria listed in Table A3.1.
   A3.3.2. Detected errors during the evaluation will be classified as “Major” or “Minor” using
   the criteria listed in Table A3.2.
   A3.3.3. Technicians/Teams that commit any error classified as a “Major” in Table A3.2
   anytime during the evaluation process will be rated “Fail”.
   A3.3.4. If the evaluator determines during the evaluation that a technician/team cannot
   correctly or safely accomplish the task without excessive outside intervention or assistance or
   lacks sufficient training, the evaluator must apply the following guidelines:
       A3.3.4.1. Terminate the task immediately.
       A3.3.4.2. Notify the      technician's/team’s   work     center   supervisor   or   Flight
       CC/Superintendent.
A3.4. Evaluator Post-Task Performance Actions. The evaluator must perform the following
actions as soon as practical after the evaluation:
   A3.4.1. Award an overall rating of “Pass” or “Fail” for the evaluated task using guidance in
   Table A3.1.
   A3.4.2. Critique the technician/team on the entire task.        The critique must cover the
   following:
       A3.4.2.1. A detailed explanation of each detected error including who received it,
       category, mission impact and correct procedures.
AFRCI20-111 5 APRIL 2011                                                                       21


      A3.4.2.2. A review of the technician’s/team’s strengths and weaknesses.
      A3.4.2.3. Recommended methods of task accomplishment.
      A3.4.2.4. An exchange of ideas and techniques.
      A3.4.2.5. For failed evaluations, notify the technician's/team’s work center supervisor or
      Flight CC/Superintendent and identify the substandard performance that contributed to
      the rating.
   A3.4.3. Report detected observations outside the scope of the evaluation as a Detected
   Safety Violation (DSV), Technical Data Violation (TDV) or Unsatisfactory Condition Report
   (UCR) based on applicability. For these detected observations, the evaluator will:
      A3.4.3.1. Correct the observation immediately, if possible.
      A3.4.3.2. Document all facts surrounding the observation for report purposes.
      A3.4.3.3. Notify LEAT leadership of the observation for verification purposes.
      A3.4.3.4. Ensure the verified observation is included in the unit report.
A3.5. Additional Trainer Proficiency Evaluation (TPE) Guidelines. In addition to the
general guidelines described in paragraphs A3.1 thru A3.4, when conducting TPEs, LEAT
evaluators will:
   A3.5.1. Coordinate with unit instructors/trainers on which tasks are acceptable for TPEs.
   A3.5.2. Brief the following items to the instructor/trainer under evaluation:
      A3.5.2.1. The instructor/trainer must prevent/immediately correct the following: Weapon
      System Safety Rules (WSSR) violations, weapon system code compromises, Two-Person
      Concept violations, significant security violations or safety errors which could result in
      serious injury to personnel, failure to use required technical data during the logistics
      process and any error which could result in potential/imminent equipment damage or
      personnel injury.
      A3.5.2.2. The instructor/trainer must correct other errors before completing the training
      session. This correction may include anything from verbal feedback to re-
      accomplishment of the erroneous procedures. The training session is considered complete
      when the instructor/trainer critiques the student’s performance.
      A3.5.2.3. Evaluators will not generate an evaluation report on the trainees. The
      evaluation will focus solely on the instructor’s/trainer’s proficiency and the efficiency of
      training delivered. Errors committed by the trainees will have no impact on the
      evaluation unless the instructor/trainer does not detect and correct the errors.
      A3.5.2.4. Evaluators will consider the instructor’s/trainer’s familiarity with procedures,
      use of and adherence to technical data and lesson plans, verbal skills, ability to clearly
      and precisely describe procedures, and the degree of control over the trainees.
      A3.5.2.5. A TPE will be rated “Fail” if the instructor/trainer does not detect, correct, and
      provide/defer re-training for any error classified as “Major” using criteria described in
      Table A3.2 of this instruction. Additionally, the evaluation will also be rated as “Fail” if
 22                                                                AFRCI20-111 5 APRIL 2011


        an incomplete training process takes place such as failing to instruct critical portions of
        the task.

7. Failure to have available and comply with required technical data while performing an action.
8. Individual not trained/certified on task being performed.
9. Failure to accomplish a critical portion of a task that results in incomplete task performance
by not verifying the operability/serviceability of support equipment, subsystem, or weapon
system component.
10. Failure to document actions/conditions that, as a reasonable expectation, would result in
erroneous equipment availability status or weapon system status; or create a significant
safety/security deficiency.
11. Failure to recognize an unacceptable condition/test result that is cause for rejection of
equipment or prevents support equipment/system or weapon system component from operating.
12. Failure to recognize an acceptable condition/test that caused rejection of serviceable
components or equipment.
13. Clearly demonstrated inability to successfully complete the task due to a lack of job
knowledge. Cannot correctly or safely accomplish task without excessive outside intervention.

15. A condition that creates an unreliable missile, missile component, equipment item or an
unsafe or insecure environment.
16. Failure to ensure proper storage, shipment and positive inventory control of nuclear
weapons, nuclear weapon systems, Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel (NWRM), classified
assets, Controlled Cryptographic Item (CCI)/ Communication Security (COMSEC), equipment,
serialized control items, weapons, and sensitive assets.
17. Significant system input errors. Errors that, as a reasonable expectation based on quantity or
sensitivity of the input(s) would result in significant loss of data accuracy.
MINOR ERRORS:
1. An error that does not prevent a support equipment/weapon system component from being
used for its intended purpose, but would, as a reasonable expectation, have a detrimental effect
on the operational life of the component/equipment/system. This may include damage to
common hand tools due to misuse.
2. An error that, as a reasonable expectation, could require support equipment to be returned to
another agency for recalibration/reverification.
3. An error that lacks the seriousness to meet the criteria for a major error.
4. Failure to read a warning or caution is a minor error, provided the warning/caution is not
violated.
