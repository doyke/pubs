                        USE OF FIREARMS SAFETY STATEMENT

A1.1. I certify that I am knowledgeable in the specific rules governing use of force by Air Force
personnel.
A1.1.1. Firearms will only be drawn when the lawful use of deadly force reasonably appears
necessary; as a signaling device as authorized in AFI 31-207, para 2.13.; or during weapons
clearing/turn-in.
A1.1.2. Air Force policy authorizes deadly force only when all lesser means have failed or
cannot reasonably be employed. In some circumstances, force, including deadly force, may be
the only option available to respond to a hostile act or hostile intent. The use of force must be
reasonable in intensity, duration, and magnitude based on the totality of the circumstances to
counter the threat. Deadly force is authorized when individuals reasonably believe that a person
poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm to themselves or DoD forces.
A1.1.3. During routine/normal operations all personnel are required to arm/carry all USAF small
arms IAW AFMAN 31-229. USAF Weapons Handling Manual. However, when responding to
an actual incident where you can reasonably expect to meet an armed adversary, respond with
firearms ready. You must base any decision to chamber a round of ammunition in a firearm that
is not normally carried with a round chambered, or draw a pistol from the holster, on the
circumstances you are facing and the threat present.
A1.2. I certify that I am knowledgeable in the Rules of Engagement (ROE) and Rules for Use of
Force (RUF) applicable to all United States Forces, Korea (USFK) personnel. These rules
include, but are not limited to:
A1.2.1. USFK policy authorizes use of deadly force only under conditions of extreme need and
as a last resort, when all lesser degrees of force have failed or cannot reasonably be used.
A1.2.2. Give the order "Halt or I will fire" in English/Korean before a shot is fired when
possible. The word for "Halt" is "JEONG-JI." The phrase "I will fire" is "CHONG-SSON-DA."
A1.2.3. Shots will not be fired if they are likely to endanger innocent persons.
A1.2.4. Warning shots are not authorized for peacetime law enforcement purposes. Refer to
theater-specific Rules of Engagement (ROE) for more information on warning shots.
A1.3. I certify that 1 am knowledgeable of general weapons safety, including but not limited to:
A1.3.1. Regard all firearms as being loaded; be knowledgeable of the safety devices of all
firearms and never use a firearm in an unauthorized manner, e.g., as a tool. Never draw or aim a
firearm in jest or use it to engage in tricks or games.
A1.3.2. Never arm yourself with a weapon you are not qualified to use. Never allow another
person to be armed with a weapon they are not qualified to use.
A1.3.3. Do not point your weapon at any person or object you do not intent to shoot. Ensure you
have a clear field of fire before firing your weapon. Ensure you check what is behind your target
as well.
Military members who violate these prohibitions may be subject to administrative or disciplinary
proceedings under Article 92, UCMJ. Civilian employees who violate this provision may be
subject to administrative or disciplinary action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or
civil sanctions for violations of related laws.

                          LAUTENBERG AMENDMENT NOTICE

The 1996 Domestic Violence Amendment to the Gun Control Act (referred to as the Lautenberg
Amendment) makes it a federal offense for anyone convicted of a misdemeanor crime of
domestic violence to ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms or ammunition. It is also a
federal offense for any person to sell or otherwise dispose of a firearm to anyone known to have
such a conviction. The DOD established policy to implement this law in November 2002. The
Air Force established policy for further implementation in February 2004.

To whom does the law apply? The law applies to all Airmen who have been convicted of a
“misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.” The law also applies to anyone who issues or sells a
weapon to someone with a qualifying conviction. Accordingly, if an Airman who has been
convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence is issued a military weapon, both the
Airman and the commander who knew of the conviction and yet authorized issuance of a
weapon would be in violation of the law. Both military issue and privately owned weapons fall
within the scope of the law.

When does the law apply? The Amendment has the following six-part test for determining
whether an individual has committed a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.”
       1. The person was convicted of a misdemeanor crime;
       2. The offense had as an element the use or attempted use of physical force, or threatened
       use of a deadly weapon;
       3. The convicted offender was at the time of the offense:
                a) a current or former spouse, parent or guardian of the victim,
                b) a person with whom the victim shared a child in common,
                c) a person who was cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a
                spouse, parent, or guardian, or
                d) a person who was similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the
                victim;
       4. The convicted offender was represented by counsel, or knowingly and intelligently
       waived the right to counsel;
       5. If entitled to have the case tried by jury, the case was actually tried by a jury or the
       person knowingly and intelligently waived the right to have the case tried by a jury, and;
       6. The conviction has not been expunged or set aside, or the convicted offender has not
       been pardoned for the offense or had civil rights restored, unless the pardon,
       expungement, or restoration of civil rights provides that the person may not ship,
       transport, possess, or receive firearms.
NOTE: The Lautenberg language does NOT apply to summary court-martial convictions,
imposition of non-judicial punishment imposed under Article 15 of the UCMJ or deferred
prosecutions (or similar alternative disposition) in civilian courts.

What should Airmen do? Airmen who are concerned that the Amendment applies to them
should contact their former defense attorney or the Area Defense Counsel (782-4848) for an
appointment to help in determining their legal status. The defense counsel can not only help

Airmen determine their status, but can also assist them in efforts to have records expunged or to
obtain pardons from applicable state governors. Additionally, if Airmen are pending
misdemeanor charges in civilian court systems for domestic violence, the defense counsel can
advise them about the impact of a conviction and any options available for deferred adjudication
or alternate resolution. It is critical Airmen receive legal advice immediately to avoid putting
themselves at risk of violating this federal law and to ensure you understand your rights and
obligations.

What should commanders do? If a commander knows or has reasonable cause to believe an
Airman has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, the commander
should not issue government-owned or privately-owned firearms or ammunition to that Airman.
If the Airman has an issued weapon and/or ammunition, the commander should retrieve it
immediately, suspend the Airman’s authority to possess firearms or ammunition, and advise the
Airman to dispose of privately-owned firearms and ammunition lawfully. The commander
should detail the Airman to duties that do not require the bearing of weapons or ammunition.
Commanders should contact the legal office (782-4283) for further guidance.

Air Force personnel must complete a DD Form 2760, Qualification to Possess Firearms or
Ammunition, annually if they regularly handle firearms or ammunition, upon PCS, PCA,
or when TDY assignments will require use of firearms or ammunition. The DD Form 2760
must be re-accomplished every time a military member or civilian employee is assigned to
duties requiring the use of firearm, destructive device, or ammunition.
