This pamphlet series is intended as a load planning guide and provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners (both long range and individual
movement) to load plan aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Equipment and methods
listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed. It must be noted that,
unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary widely,
even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval, therefore, ultimately rests with the
individual contractor providing airlift services to the DOD. This pamphlet series enables
application of DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation – Part III Mobility, Appendix
V, Aircraft Load Planning and Documentation; as well as AMCI 10-402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet
(CRAF). The guidance contained herein is applicable to all USAF, AFRC, ANG and DOD
agencies whenever they are charged with using the CRAF assets contained herein, in accordance
with DOD, inter-service, and/or MAJCOM agreements.

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This pamphlet series is non-directive in nature. It provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners to more efficiently and effectively
load plan aircraft in the CRAF.

1.2. Scope. CRAF aircraft specifications listed herein are current as of the date of this printing.
Equipment and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed.
It must be noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not
standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval,
therefore, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DOD.
1.2.1. Volume 2, Airbus. AMCPAM 24-2, Volume 2 deals specifically with aircraft
manufactured by Airbus S.A.S. Corporation. Airbus was first created in 1970 as Airbus Industrie
GIE, a multi-national consortium, and is currently owned by European Aeronautic Defence and
Space Company (EADS). As of the date of this publication, Airbus S.A.S. has provided more
than 5,900 aircraft to carriers worldwide, with over 5,600 still in operation.

1.3. Arrangement. This pamphlet series is designed for easy reference and access to the most
commonly needed information for planning purposes. Essentially, Volume 1 will contain all
information common to the entire CRAF program and most, if not all, carriers. Volumes 2
through 5 will contain information specific to a particular manufacturer’s airframes, with each
sub-volume addendum addressing a different series or type. Each can be referenced separately
from another; however, each addendum needs to be used in conjunction with Volume 1.
1.3.1. Volume 2, Airbus Addenda. Volume 2 is not separated from each subsequent addendum,
but is published as a “cover” document along with and as an introduction for each addendum.
The same information for Volume 2 essentially gets republished--unchanged with each Airbus
model’s addendum.
1.3.2. Volume 2, Airbus Quick Reference Tables. All chapter descriptions for various models
are designed to be used in conjunction with Chapter 2 Quick Reference Tables. The information
in the Quick Reference Tables will generally not be restated in the expanded chapters as they are
meant primarily for pictorial figures.

1.4. Supplements. Changes or supplements to this pamphlet by agencies, other than AMC, are
prohibited. This does not preclude its use as a reference document for preparation of intra-
agency instructional directives.

1.5. Acronyms. An explanation of the acronyms used in this pamphlet is in AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 1, Attachment 1.

1.7. Description. Addendum B. Airbus A310 Series.
The A310 Series aircraft launched in 1978, and was type-certified in 1983. This was the second
series in the Airbus family of aircraft. Airbus's intent of the A310 was to offer airlines a smaller,
longer range alternative to its A300 Series aircraft. The A310 was still a wide-body passenger
aircraft, and kept the 222" diameter fuselage innovation of its predecessor. However, planning of
the A310 was designed to maximize fuel efficiency through the use of composite material,
wingtip design, and smaller size. Overall, 255 A310s were manufactured, with the last one
delivered in 1998, and the production line being shut down in 2007.

The two primary variants of the A310 series are the A310-200 and A310-300. The A310-200
was also offered as a freighter (holding a C or F designation) by Airbus. However, certain
A310-300s have also been adapted for use as a freighter by different carriers.

AMCPAM 24-2, Volume 2, Addendum B will focus primarily on the:
A310-200
A310-300
A310-200 C/F

                               QUICK REFERENCE TABLES

2.1. Ranges. Most numbers are shown as a range, due to representing all-passenger to all-freight
versions OR due to different modifications within a series/type. Also, within a series, several
different engines/weight classes may exist.

2.2. Pallets. Unless otherwise noted, pallet information is based on the civilian pallet IATA code
PAG- / P1P- type LD7 which measures 88" × 125".

2.3. Table Legends.
2.3.1. Compartments. Unless otherwise noted, compartments are: M=Main/Upper;
F=Forward/Lower Lobe; A=Aft/Lower Lobe; B=Bulk/Lower Lobe.

2.3.2. “X”. An “X” represents the information does NOT apply for that series/type (ex: an all-
passenger version would have an “X” by Main Compartment Door)

2.3.3. Question Mark “?”. A “?” represents that the information should apply, but no
information exists in the manufacturer’s technical manuals.

2.3.4. Exclamation Point “!”. An “!” represents information that should apply, but has been
derived from a reliable, but non-manufacturer source.

2.4. After-Market Conversions. As a reminder, individual airlines may have converted an
airframe apart from the manufacturer’s original specifications. These tables and the charts in the
following chapters do not account for this.

2.5. Tables. The following tables (Tables 2.1 through 2.6) will vary with each AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 2 Addendum.

                                               aircraft length - excludes any tapered section of the fuselage).
                                            2) Minimum 2 inches of clearance must exist between aircraft contour and maximum payload contour (represented by inner solid line of
                                               the contour drawing).

                                            3) All horizontal dimensions are measured left or right of aircraft centerline (CL).
                                            4) All vertical dimensions are measured from the top of the conveyor plane.
                                            5) Reference number of L301 for this contour assigned by IATA for easy identification.
                                            6) The specifications of airframe manufacturer and/or carrier will ALWAYS take precedence over this chart.
