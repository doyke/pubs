      unavailable (i.e. nighttime, closed for repairs, in use by other aircraft), the hazardous
      cargo spot on Taxiway F will be used. Once in the hung flare area, the aircraft will be
      shut down using normal procedures. Responding EOD teams will analyze hazards and
      direct safing of flares by CLS personnel.
      6.1.5. Damaged or hung flares will be downloaded by CLS personnel only after EOD
      determines there are no additional hazards, prior to moving the aircraft to the main ramp
      area. (Note: Contractor personnel will perform all weapons functions).

      parking ramp and the crew will be transported to their squadron. CLS personnel will
      perform all required maintenance actions, to include removing the associated flare
      module, to determine the cause of the condition and any required remedy.
   6.2. Explosive Operation Emergencies
      6.2.1. If an emergency situation is encountered inside the MSA, stop operations in the
      immediate area, sound an alarm, radio munitions control and evacuate the appropriate
      distance for the hazard located in the facility.
