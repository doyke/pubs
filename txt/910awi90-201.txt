This is an initial publication of 910th Airlift Wing Instruction 90-201.

1. Purpose
   1.1. A robust self inspection (SI) program that incorporates MICT at all levels of command
   and supervision will raise and keep a unit’s organization effectiveness at high levels, enable
   visibility of issues, increase understanding of issue impact and make formal inspections more
2                                                                                   910AWI90-201


    predictable, effective and efficient. This will enable the chain of command and supervision
    to better focus on four things.
       1.1.1. Key mission, personnel and organizational requirements.
       1.1.2. Instilling and promoting a culture of responsibility, accountability and correction.
       1.1.3. Solving inspection issues more effectively in shorter times.
       1.1.4. Enhancing information flow by integrating operations at all levels.
2. Program
    2.1. Suspenses
       2.1.1. All 910 AW Squadrons, Units and Functions will use this instruction and MICT to
       the maximum extent possible to prepare for 22nd Air Force Staff Assistance Visits and
       AFRC Unit Compliance Inspections (UCIs). All AFRC UCI checklists are in MICT and
       notification of any changes to them will be emailed to personnel who are assigned those
       checklists in MICT.
       2.1.2. March 1st of every year: All Squadrons, Units and Functions will begin their
       formal review and accomplishment of MICT SI checklists that apply to their
       responsibilities. AFRC is required to update the MICT checklists in January and
       February of each year. By March 1st any checklist that is going to change should be
       changed.
       2.1.3. March 15th of every year: All Squadron MICT Unit Admin personnel will
       complete MICT SI checklist selection and have relevant checklists assigned to their unit’s

       their formal review and accomplishment of MICT SI checklists that apply to their

       use other databases to accomplish self-inspection will shift to May 15th of every year as a
       completion date (if possible). This will align the Wing SI Program, MICT and the
       Management Control Program Statement of Assurance schedule until they merge.
       2.1.5. September 1st of every year: All Squadrons, Units and Functions will begin a
       formal review and re-accomplishment of MICT SI checklists that apply to their
       responsibilities.

       complete a formal review and accomplishment of MICT SI checklists that apply to their
       responsibilities.
    2.2. Objectives
       2.2.1. Utilize MICT to the maximum extent possible for all future 910 AW Self
       Inspection completion. Use MICT to prepare for all future 22nd Air Force Staff
       Assistance Visits (SAVs) and AFRC and USAF formal inspections.
       2.2.2. Realign the 910 AW SI schedule to our SAV, UCI and MCP SOA schedule.
910AWI90-201                                                                                    3
