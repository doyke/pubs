Terms
Command and Control Program—Represents C2 operations facilitated through the use of
information technology (IT) systems interconnected via a communication network or network of
networks (Note: Reference “net-enabled” description in footnote 9 of the DoD Command and
Control Implementation Plan, v 1.0, 1 October 2009.).
The following terms and their definitions are for the purposes of this document. Where no
citation appears, the term has been derived from several sources or from common usage.
Command and Control System—The facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, and
personnel essential to a commander for planning, directing, and controlling operations of
assigned and attached forces pursuant to the missions assigned. (Joint Pub 6-0).
Core Function Lead Integrators—CSAF-designated leaders who act as the principal
integrators for their assigned SCFs and the corresponding CFMPs. CFLIs guide SCF maturation
and SCF-related investments by establishing SCF strategy and by planning over a 20-year
period. (AFI 90-1101 [DRAFT])
Defense Business System—An information system, other than a national security system (NSS),
operated by, for, or on behalf of DoD, including financial systems, mixed systems, financial

feeder systems, and information technology (IT) and information assurance (IA) infrastructure.
Defense business systems support business activities such as acquisition, financial management,
logistics, strategic planning and budgeting, installations and environment, and human resource
management. (DoDI 5000.02)
Designated Accrediting Authority—Official with the authority to formally assume
responsibility for operating a system at an acceptable level of risk. Synonymous with designated
approving authority and delegated accrediting authority. (DoDI 8500.2)
Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3)—The impact of the EME on the operational
capability of military forces, equipment, systems, and platforms. It encompasses all
electromagnetic disciplines, including EMC and electromagnetic interference; electromagnetic
vulnerability; electromagnetic pulse; electro-static discharge; hazards of electromagnetic
radiation to personnel, ordnance, and volatile materials; and natural phenomena effects of
lightning and precipitation static.
Information Technology (IT)—Any equipment, or interconnected system or subsystem of
equipment, that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management,
movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or
information by the executive agency. This includes equipment used by a Component directly, or
used by a contractor under a contract with the Component, which (1) requires the use of such
equipment, or (2) requires the use, to a significant extent, of such equipment in the performance
of a service or the furnishing of a product. The term “IT” also includes computers, ancillary
equipment, software, firmware, and similar procedures, services (including support services),
and related resources. The term “IT” normally includes NSS (DoDD 4630.05). In this
publication, however, the term NSS is used to distinguish from other IT those activities involving
intelligence or cryptographic activities and associated directives unique to those functions.
National Security System (NSS)—Any telecommunications or information system (IS)
operated by the U.S. Government, the function, operation, or use of which: 1) involves
intelligence activities; 2) involves cryptologic activities related to national security; 3) involves
command and control of military forces; 4) involves equipment that is an integral part of a
weapon or weapons system; or 5) is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence
missions (this does not include a system that is to be used for routine administrative and business
applications, including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications).
(DoDD 8000.1 and 40 U.S.C. § 11103)
System Program Manager—The individual designated in accordance with criteria established
by the appropriate Component (AF) Acquisition Executive to manage an acquisition program
and is appropriately certified under the provisions of the Defense Acquisition Workforce
Improvement Act. The program manager is responsible for the execution of a program within the
approved Acquisition Program Baseline.
Weapon System—A combination of one or more weapons with all related equipment, materials,
services, personnel, and means of delivery and deployment (if applicable) required for self-
sufficiency. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Warfighting Integration—Ensuring information interoperability and compatibility of
warfighting capabilities (e.g. people, processes, and technology) across the Air Force service
core functions and within joint capability areas.

Warfighting System—The facilities, equipment, procedures, and personnel employing NSS or
interconnected via a communication network essential to an operational commander for
executing the missions assigned.
