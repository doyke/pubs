                                     DUTIES ASSIGNED

1.1. General. Implementation and execution of a comprehensive fire prevention and protection
program require the involvement of all personnel. It is an inherent responsibility. In order to
provide the community the best program possible, certain individuals are specifically tasked
regarding program safety, execution, enforcement, and funding.
   1.1.1. Commander, 31st Fighter Wing. The Wing Commander establishes the 31 FW’s
   fire protection and prevention programs.
1.2. Commander, 31st Mission Support Group. The 31st Mission Support Group
Commander is responsible to the Wing Commander for fire protection and acting upon the
advice of the Base Fire Marshal and Fire Chief, is the final approval/disapproval authority on
issues that can be determined at levels lower than higher headquarters.
1.3. Base Fire Marshal. The 31st Civil Engineer Squadron Commander is the 31 FW’s Fire
Marshal. This individual executes a comprehensive fire protection and prevention program for
the wing, as outlined in DoDI 6055.6, AFPD 32-20, and the National Fire Codes published by
the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). The commander is responsible for advocating
any additional funding required for fire fighter safety, facilities, equipment, and training in
support of the fire protection and prevention program. The Fire Marshal coordinates with the
Fire Chief concerning the base fire protection and prevention program, long range strategic
planning, funding improvements, and interpretation of directives.
1.4. Fire Chief. The Fire Chief is responsible to the Wing Fire Marshal for establishing and
carrying out effective fire protection and prevention programs. The Fire Chief is in complete
charge of all firefighting, crash, rescue, and hazardous materials mitigation activities unless
properly relieved by designated and trained personnel. In the absence of the Fire Chief, the next
Senior Fire Officer (SFO) will fulfill these duties.
1.5. Fire Safety Technicians. The Fire Safety Technician conducts periodic visits to all
facilities and areas to perform quality control checks of unit fire prevention programs, inspect
compliance of fire prevention practices and facility construction to established criteria, and
provide requested training to the base populace. The Fire Safety Technician has full authority to
stop any operation considered an immediate threat or danger to life or property.
1.6. Functional Managers. Functional managers are commanders controlling major functional
areas, all squadron commanders, Operations and Maintenance (O & M) contractor site manager,
Commissary Manager, and the Army and Air Force Exchange Services (AAFES) General
Manager. They are responsible for administering the fire prevention program within their
functional area and ensuring identified fire safety deficiencies (FSDs) and fire hazards assigned a
risk assessment code (RAC) are corrected. In the event unity personnel identify a hazard that
they cannot correct, the manager will ensure the Fire Prevention Office (FPO) is notified for
assistance. The functional manager will develop a unit/detachment Operating Instruction (OI)
that addresses fire reporting, fire reaction and evacuation procedures, fire safety measures, unit
specific hazards and initial and recurring unit/detachment specific fire prevention training for
assigned personnel.      Unit OIs must be submitted to the fire prevention office for
review/coordination. OIs must be reviewed and updated annually. The manager will require that

assigned personnel receive initial and recurring organizational fire prevention and extinguisher
training.
1.7. Unit Commanders. Violations of the prohibitions in Chapter 4 may carry punitive
consequences under the UCMJ.
1.8. Facility Managers. Facility managers are directly responsible for the fire safety of
facilities under their control. They will accompany the fire safety technicians during assessments
and immediately take corrective action on any hazards noted. They are directly responsible to
the functional manager for the submission and follow-up of all work and job orders pertaining to
the fire prevention program for their assigned facility. They ensure initial and recurring fire

initiate corrective actions.
     1.8.1. Notify the Fire Prevention Office (FPO) prior to any situation or event which will
     temporarily change or alter the use of a facility from its approved use and designation, i.e.
     overnight lock-in in youth facilities; billeting of troops in other than dormitories; formations,
     gatherings, parties in hangars, etc. Notify the FPO, in writing, at least 48 hours prior, of the
     location and building number of any facility where there are sleeping personnel, other than
     those designated as sleeping facilities.
     1.8.2. Ensure all newly assigned personnel receive unit specific Fire Prevention, Fire Safety,
     and Fire Extinguisher training within 30 days of assignment. Both facility and wheeled flight
     line extinguisher training is available from the FPO by request.
1.9. Unit Supervisors. On a periodic basis, unit supervisors will perform walk through
inspections of facilities under their control and ensure proper documentation is maintained
regarding inspection of extinguishers, emergency lighting, evacuation drills, and personnel
training. They serve as an internal quality control for the unit fire prevention program.

                                            Chapter 2

                                      FIRE REPORTING

2.1. General. All fires occurring in AF facilities, to include off-base housing and leased
facilities, will be reported to the Aviano AB Fire Department. This includes fires that have been
extinguished. This is required for investigation, cause determination, and statistical compilation.
   2.1.1. Fires Occurring On-Base. Initial fire reporting may be accomplished by either
   establishing telephone contact with the Fire Department or activation of an installed fire
   protection system. Once the fire is reported, stand by outside the facility and meet with the
   responding senior fire official to provide any additional information.
       2.1.1.1. The primary fire reporting number is 911. This number activates the emergency
       phone line located at the Emergency Communications Center (ECC). The on duty
       operator will ask you if you are reporting a fire, medical, or police emergency.
       2.1.1.2. When reporting an emergency to the ECC operator, provide the following
       information: your name, building number, name of facility, nature of the fire, location of
       the fire, and telephone number. An example from a base facility: “This is Airman John
       Doe; I’m reporting a fire in Bldg. 1411, the Base Exchange. We have an electrical fire in
       the storeroom. I am calling from extension 632-5555.”
       2.1.1.3. Should an alarm system be used, it is imperative that the report be immediately
       followed up by telephone contact with the ECC using 911. This is necessary to ensure
       that a possible system malfunction does not prevent the fire department from receiving
       the coded alarm signal.
       2.1.1.4. Although unlikely, an accident may occur which prevents telephone
       communications with the Fire Department, e.g., severed phone cable. In the event the
       Fire Department cannot be notified by telephone, fire reporting may be accomplished by
       radio using the crash net, or in person utilizing a runner. The Fire Department is in Bldg.
       1434, located on the south side of the flight line near the security forces complex and
       across from the dormitories.
   2.1.2. Fires Occurring Off-Base. Fire fighting response to facilities located off base is
   handled by the local Italian Fire Department located in Pordenone by dialing 112.
       2.1.2.1. The number to dial from off base and cell phones is 0434-30-8911. When
       reporting a fire to the ECC operator, provide the following information: your name,
       building number, name of facility, nature of the fire, location of the fire, and telephone
       number. The operator will notify the Italian Fire Department.
       2.1.2.2. All fires, regardless of size and whether or not they have been extinguished,
       must be reported to the Fire Department for investigation and reporting. This notification
       should be made immediately by contacting 911 or 632-5381.

                                              Chapter 3

                                         FIRE REACTION

3.1. General. The success of any fire fighting action is directly associated with the initial fire
reaction by the facility occupants. The most lethal elements of any fire are occupant panic and
smoke inhalation. Priority consideration must be given to the safe evacuation of people located
in the facility. The decision to attempt to fight any fire in the incipient or beginning stage using
installed fire extinguishers is an occupant decision. It is important that you know which fires to
attempt to fight and which fires to walk away from. As a rule of thumb, if there is any doubt at
all regarding your capabilities and your ability to successfully extinguish the fire using accessible
resources, immediately evacuate, do not attempt to fight the fire.
     3.1.1. Occupant Notification. Immediately upon discovering a fire, all occupants are to be
     notified of the situation. If a fire alarm system is installed in the facility, the most expedient
     method is to activate the manual alarm station that will set off the alarm sounding/signaling
     devices. Should a fire alarm system not function properly or there is no fire alarm system
     present in the facility, someone must orally notify the facility occupants. This can be
     accomplished by sending a runner throughout the facility shouting “Fire, Fire, Fire.” A
     public address system can be used to supplement evacuation instructions.
     3.1.2. Battery operated manual fire alarm stations shall be provided within facilities not
     equipped with an installed hardwired fire detection system. Facility managers must budget
     for the purchase of these stations. They shall be installed near the exits and must be
     operationally tested monthly.
3.2. Fire Evacuation. The safe evacuation of facility occupants is the primary consideration.
Immediately upon hearing or seeing evacuation warnings, e.g., an occupant shouting “Fire, Fire,
Fire,” hearing alarm bells, or seeing evacuation strobes, all personnel will exit the facility, and
proceed to an area located at least 100 feet (30 meters) from the facility. In places of public
assembly, it is the staff’s responsibility to ensure occupants are immediately notified and
evacuated in an orderly fashion.
     3.2.1. A fire evacuation plan must be located near all of the facilities exits. Evacuation plans
     must reflect: primary and alternate evacuation routes; location of the fire alarm panel, manual
     fire pull stations, and portable fire extinguishers. In addition the location of emergency utility
     shutoff valves (ie. electrical, gas, fuel, and boiler). The evacuation plan must reflect the re-
     assembly or rally locations.
3.3. Fire evacuation from High Rise Structures. Due to the construction and inherent safety
features of high rise structures; there are times when evacuation may not be advisable.
Specifically, any time there is a fire located on a floor below you and smoke or hot gases are
coming up the common stairwell. In these instances, your office or apartment may be the safest
area, an area of refuge. Close your front door and seal any cracks around the door with a wet
towel. Get everyone in the room that is furthest from the entrance and faces the road. Ensure all
windows are closed. Close all doors between the front door and the room you are in. Hang a
sheet or indicator out of the room’s window and close the window. Stay in the room until
removed by fire fighters or you are sure the emergency is terminated. Under no circumstances
should you attempt to escape from the facility using the elevator.

3.4. Fire Fighting Using Portable Fire Extinguishers. Fire extinguishers should be
considered the first line of defense to attack fires for facility occupants. The decision by facility
occupants to attempt to fight any fire must be a conscious decision. Personnel who are not
knowledgeable of the extinguisher operating procedures and limitations should not attempt to
fight the fire. Fire fighting with extinguishers must be limited to those circumstances when the
fire is in the incipient stage and the person attempting to fight the fire is not unnecessarily
endangered. Any fire fighting attempt-using extinguishers should involve at least two people.
3.5. Activating Installed Fire Suppression Systems. In specified areas, e.g., commercial
cooking, air traffic control tower, paint spray booth, fuel cell maintenance facilities, fire
suppression systems are installed. In the event of a fire, they should activate automatically.
However, a mechanical failure of the automatic features may occur. Should this happen,
employees must be trained to manually activate the system and should do so in the event of a
fire.

                                      FIRE PREVENTION

5.1. General. The objectives of the 31 FW Fire Prevention Program are to ensure personnel
assigned to the base and/or residing on the base or in facilities are aware of their fire prevention
responsibilities, to provide fire prevention guidance in order to maintain fire-safe work and living
environments, to eliminate the causes of uncontrolled fire, and, despite these efforts, should a fire
occur, to limit injuries and losses due to fire. The human element causes the majority of fires
through negligent acts of apathy. The key to a successful fire prevention program is personal
involvement.
   5.1.1. Application of Standard Criteria. Unless specifically addressed by DoD, Unified
   Facilities Criteria (UFC), AF criteria, or Italian fire prevention standards the Articles of the
   NFPA Standards that are directive in nature will be used for compliance.
5.2. Compressed Gases. The use and storage of compressed gases will be as prescribed in DoD
Dir 4145.19-R-1, Storage and Materials Handling, Technical Order (T.O.) 42B5-1-2, Gas
Cylinders –Use, Handling, and Maintenance, NFPA Standard 54, National Fuel Gas Code, and
Italian law UNI 7131. Cylinders will not be stored indoors, below ground level, basements,
bathrooms, or living rooms.
   5.2.1. Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). Bombola cylinders shall be installed and maintained
   to comply with NFPA 58 and Italian Fire Codes. Cylinders must be installed outside of the
   facility. If necessary submit an AF Form 332, Civil Engineer Work request to have the
   cylinder relocated and piped to the appliance. Gas lines must be metal tubing and installed in
   such a manner to prevent damage to the tube, cylinder and appliance. An on/off valve must
   be installed near the appliance for emergency shut-off of the gas supply. Replace connection
   gaskets on the regulator each time the cylinder is changed or replaced.
       5.2.1.1. LPG gas cylinders must NOT be stored or placed in direct sunlight and spare
       cylinders must be stored inside an Italian approved reinforced concrete cylinder cabinet.
5.3. Curtains, Drapes, and Furnishings. Curtains, drapes, and furnishings used in places of
public assembly, recreation facilities, the hospital, dormitories, VQs, TLFs, transient quarters,

facilities will conform to the fire retardant requirements specified in NFPA Standard 101.
5.4. Decorations.
   5.4.1. Decorations used in places of public assembly, recreational facilities, mercantile
   facilities, schools, and CDC facilities will be treated with a commercial fire retardant
   treatment or possess documented inherent fire retardant qualities. Documentation will be
   readily available for presentation to representatives of the Fire Department attesting to these
   characteristics. The excessive use of combustible materials for interior decorations is
   prohibited. Material will not exceed 10% of the total ceiling or wall space.
   5.4.2. Decorations, to include mirrors, will not obscure exits, exit lights, or portions of exits,
   nor will they be arranged in any manner that may confuse facility occupants regarding exit
   locations. Do not hang any decorations from sprinkler heads, pipes, electrical conduit, or

       5.4.4.1. Natural (live) Christmas trees are prohibited from use in public assembly,
       educational, health care, lodging, and dormitory facilities. Trees that are dry and
       shedding needles will be removed from the facility and disposed of. Cut trees will have
       approx. two inches of the base sawed off immediately prior to being brought into the
       facility. The base of the tree will be placed in wet sand to assist the tree in remaining
       viable. Fire retardant spray treatments will not be used on live trees as this serves to seal
       the tree and prevent respiration.
5.5. Deep Fat Fryers.
   5.5.1. Deep fat fryers and operation of these units will comply with AFI 91-203, Air Force
   Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction, Chapter 6. Thermostats will be tested or

            FIRE SAFETY ASSESSMENTS AND ASSESSMENT PROGRAM

8.1. Assessment Process. The primary responsibility for fire prevention and compliance with
recommendations of the Fire Safety Technician rests with the unit commander. The following
procedures will be complied with during fire safety assessment visits:
   8.1.1. The Fire Safety Technician will coordinate the Unit’s Fire Safety Assessment with the
   Wing Safety Office in order to conduct joint assessments, if possible. Unit Safety
   Representatives (USR) will be the focal point for this process. Unit commanders, at their
   discretion, will receive an in-brief prior to starting the assessment and out-brief at the
   conclusion of the assessment. The purpose of the assessment the unit commanders fire safety
   program and unit facilities and provide recommendations for improvement.
   8.1.2. AF Form 218, Facility Fire Prevention/Protection Record or electronic equivalent
   will be used as a checklist and recording document during the entire assessment process. Use
   the reverse side of the form to document fire safety assessments where no hazards or
   deficiencies are noted. If any hazards or deficiencies are noted, the Unit Commander and
   USR will receive a copy of the Memorandum or AF Form 1487 used for special and out-of-
   cycle assessments. Once the unit receives the assessment report, they should distribute it to
   facility managers to initiate corrective actions for all noted deficiencies and/or hazards. The
   USR should compile all corrective action inputs from their facility managers and route the
   corrective action report to the unit commander for signature. This is to ensure the
   commander is aware of the corrective action taken and address any deficiencies or hazards
   that could not be corrected prior to the reports suspense date. The final report must be routed
   to the FPO prior to the suspense date.
   8.1.3. Hazards noted during the assessment that cannot be corrected on the spot will be
   documented on the Unit Commander’s Memorandum or AF Form 1487. Time frame for
   indicating corrective action taken will be established by the Fire Safety Technician, usually
   within 30-days precluding unusual circumstances. Follow-Up inspections are conducted 90
   days after inspection closeout.
