SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It has been
revised to expand on the procedures and responsibilities of the unit Transportation Security Plan
 2                                                      LUKEAFBI24-203 11 OCTOBER 2011


Representatives (TSPR) to ensure military and DoD civilian motor vehicle operators who
transport hazardous materials are properly licensed and trained.

BACKGROUND. Since 11 September 2001, government agencies have increased security
requirements for Hazardous Material (HM) being transported over commercial highways that
could pose a serious danger to national security. Recent enactments by the Department of
Homeland Security, in conjunction with other federal agencies, have mandated increased
measures be taken to protect shipments of HM and certain hazardous waste. The DOT enacted
changes to CFR 49, Part 172, adopted 20 Jun 03, by final rule that requires persons who offer
certain HM for transportation in commerce and persons who transport certain HM in commerce
to develop and implement security plans consistent with CFR 49, Part 172, changes by
25 Sep 03. The final rule also includes new security awareness training requirements for all HM
employees. Guidelines for this requirement have been incorporated into CFR 49, Part 172,
Subpart 1, DoD 4500.9R, Chapter 205, Para X. This instruction meets the security standards
outlined and mandated by CFR 49, Part 172 and DoD 4500.9R, Part II.
1. SECURITY PLAN COMPONENTS. This plan specifically deals with transportation
security of HM. This plan applies to personnel/employees who work in a shipping, receiving, or
materiel handling area or who may be involved in preparing or transporting HM. For purposes
of this plan, HM applies to new, off-spec, or wasted HM, including material waste deemed
hazardous to include industrial process waste. Hazardous waste is shipped in accordance to CFR
49 under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
     1.1. For HM offered for shipment, 56th Logistics Readiness Squadron Cargo Movements
     (56 LRS/LGRDDC) will ensure commercial and government vehicle operators meet
     requirements as outlined in DoD 4500.9R, Chapters 204 and 205, before releasing materials
     to them. For HM managed by 56th Civil Engineer Squadron Natural Resources Management
     (56 CES/CEAN), the Program Manager will certify the carrier meets all applicable DOT
     requirements to ensure safe, secure, and efficient transport through the Defense Reutilization
     and Marketing Office (DRMO) hazardous waste contract.
     1.2. For locations that store, handle, or transport HM, the applicable squadron commander
     will designate, in writing, facility, location, primary, and alternate TSPR responsible for
     requirements as outlined in this guidance. The squadron commander will also ensure
     assigned personnel who handle HM meet security and training requirements as outlined in
     this instruction.
     1.3. Unauthorized Access.
        1.3.1. Entry onto the installation is controlled by the 56th Security Forces Squadron (56
        SFS) on a 24-hour per day basis. The 56 SFS personnel also patrol the installation 24-
        hours per day. Wing personnel/employees will notify 56 SFS (and their TSPR) if they at
        any time suspect an unauthorized entry or access to HM.
            1.3.1.1. During patrols, the 56 SFS will pay particular attention to wing locations
            known to ship, receive, or store HM. These locations include:
                1.3.1.1.1. Building 948, 56 LRS/LGRDDC, Cargo Movements
                1.3.1.1.2. Building 927, 56 LRS/ LGRMSH, HAZMART
                1.3.1.1.3. Building 374, 56 CES/CEAN, 90-Day Hazardous Waste Accumulation

             Site
     1.3.2. The TSPR will perform facility/equipment inspections using Attachment 2. The
     TSPR is responsible for the following:
         1.3.2.1. Inspecting facility to ensure gates and doors are closed and locked during
         non-duty hours.
         1.3.2.2. Inspecting areas for any evidence of unauthorized entry. Immediately notify
         56 SFS of any unauthorized entry. (Note: If any quantities of HM are determined to
         be missing, the squadron commander will immediately notify appropriate authorities
         and HQ AETC/A4R.)
         1.3.2.3. Ensuring the building supervisor maintains positive control of all keys and
         locks in accordance with installation and squadron security criteria.
         1.3.2.4. Ensuring access to HM is restricted to only authorized personnel. During
         increased FPCON, visitors will register, providing photo identification (e.g., driver’s
         license, ID badge) at the time of registration and be escorted through the HM area.
         1.3.2.5. Ensuring strict accountability of HM.
         1.3.2.6. Conducting periodic inventory of HM to determine if loss or theft has
         occurred.
         1.3.2.7. Ensuring after-hours access to HM is restricted to emergencies or mission-
         essential activities.
         1.3.2.8. Requesting 56 SFS conduct periodic crime-prevention surveys.
         1.3.2.9. Ensuring access to HM storage areas is limited to a single entry point.
  1.4. En route Security.
     1.4.1. In addition to requirements contained in this instruction, all applicable provisions
     of LUKEAFBI 24-201, Shipping, Receiving, and Secure Holding of Explosives will be
     met for handling explosives. The 56 LRS/LGRDDC will work with 56th Equipment
     Management Squadron (56 EMS) to ensure pick up and delivery of munitions shipments
     are properly scheduled and documentation is accurate to prevent any delays in the
     transportation pipeline.
     1.4.2. For shipments of HM to off-base locations (over public access roads and
     highways), HM will only be released to properly identified representatives
     trained/certified to transport HM as required in DTR Part II and the CFR. The 56
     LRS/LGRDDC will conduct advance planning to include liaison with the
     destination/consignee, carrier, and Surface Deployment and Distribution Command
     (SDDC) operations center to effect safe, secure, and efficient transport of HM. For HM
     managed by 56 CES/CEAN, the hazardous waste program manager will certify the
     carrier meets all applicable DOT requirements to ensure safe, secure, and efficient
     transport through the DRMO hazardous waste contract.

          1.4.2.1. The 56 LRS/LGRDDC or 56 CES/CEAN will notify 56 SFS authorities of
          any known vulnerable HM shipments transiting Luke AFB.
          1.4.2.2. The 56 LRS or 56 CES/CEAN will perform a joint accountability assessment
          at time of transfer between LRS/CEAN personnel and the transportation agent. The
          signature of the
56 LRS Traffic Manager or designated government agent (56 LRS/LGRDDC) and the
transporter must be reflected on all transfer documentation managed by 56 LRS. Signature of
the Hazardous Waste Program Manager (56 CES/CEAN) or designated government agent
(56 CES/CEAN) and the transporter must be reflected on all transfer documentation for HM
managed by 56 CES/CEAN.
          1.4.2.3. The transporter must secure HM in lockable compartments at the time of
          pick up. The transporter must provide and affix a numbered tamper seal (or other
          suitable locking mechanism) to the container and record the number and the time/date
          affixed to the container at the time of departure from Luke AFB. The vehicle must
          not depart the premises until this has been accomplished.
          1.4.2.4. For transport vehicles that do not possess locking compartments, the vehicle
          odometer reading (at time of departure) will be recorded on the transfer
          documentation.
          1.4.2.5. The transfer documentation must reflect the names and signatures of the
          transporter,
56 CES/CEAN, 56 LRS/LGRDDC or designated government agent, and seal number.
          1.4.2.6. Qualified LRS or CEAN personnel and qualified commercial or military

LUKEAFBI24-203 11 OCTOBER 2011                                                                   5


       1.4.3. Reference LUKEAFBI 32-7002, Hazardous Material Management, for on base
       transfers of HM. Unregulated HM (below reportable quantities listed in CFR 49,
       172.101), will only be released to properly identified supply customer representatives,
       transport agencies, or disposal facility. Customers are validated as authorized to receive
       HM via the Standard Asset Tracking System. For regulated quantities of HM (reportable
       quantities listed in CFR 49, 172.101) released to supply customers, unpackaging is not
       required for on-installation movement. Under these circumstances, some form of
       documentation, e.g., DD Form 1348-1A, Single Line Item Requisition System Document,
       Standard Form (SF) 361, Transportation Discrepancy Report or DD Form 836,
       Dangerous Goods Shipping Paper/Declaration and Emergency Response, must
       accompany the item to aid in tracking and managing the HM while on installation. This
       on-installation transport means the driver must go directly to the overpass (no deviations
       on public roads authorized). Furthermore, vehicle operators must receive training as
       indicated in Para 2.2.2. below. Note: HM is not authorized to be transported in POVs
       (reference DTR 4500.9R, Part 11, Chapter 204).
   1.5. General Security Requirements.
       1.5.1. Using Attachment 3 as a guide, the TSPR will develop a written site-specific plan
       that explains how employees/personnel should react to hazardous security incidents.
       Each employee at that site (building/area) must be trained and know the exact location of
       this plan. The TSPR will maintain records of all training, site plans, facility inspections,
       and/or security incidents involving HM for a period of 3 years.
       1.5.2. All 56 FW personnel/employees will ensure (for locations that
       store/handle/transport HM) visitors park outside the facility unless specifically authorized
       to enter the area to load or unload HM or other property/material.
       1.5.3. When applicable, personnel/employees will inspect departing vehicles (that had
       access to HM area) to ensure no unauthorized removal of material.
       1.5.4. All 56 FW personnel/employees will ensure HM storage area/facility is never left
       unsecured.
       1.5.5. The 56 SFS will use base media (e-mail, newsletters, and base paper/bulletin) to
       keep wing personnel aware of any increase in security threats, crime trends, or other
       identified vulnerabilities. Wing officials will notify wing personnel/employees of any
       increase in security threats as outlined in 56 FW OPLAN 10-1, Antiterrorism/Force
       Protection Plan.
       1.5.6. The 56 SFS will ensure all DOT placarded vehicles are escorted to designated
       locations on the installation. Escort will be provided by personnel from the receiving
       agency. An SFS patrol will escort munitions shipments to the secure holding area. In the
       event of large quantities of HM, SFS support will be coordinated as necessary.
2. REQUIRED TRAINING. Current U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) regulations
require training (and retraining) of all employees who perform work functions covered by the
HM regulations (CFR 49, Parts 171-180). Any employee who works in a shipping, receiving, or
materiel handling area or who may be involved in preparing or transporting HM requires
training. Squadron commanders will ensure assigned unit personnel/employees meet the
requirements outlined in this regulation and CFR 49, Subpart H and I. All training must be
 6                                                     LUKEAFBI24-203 11 OCTOBER 2011


conducted within 90 days of employment/assignment, and recurring training is required every 3
years.
     2.1. General Awareness/Familiarization Training. The Office of HM Safety has prepared
     training modules that meet the requirements for General Awareness Training as prescribed in
     CFR               49,              Part            172,            Subpart              H,
     http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/training/publications/modules. The TSPR may use
     these modules to train assigned personnel/employees.
     2.2. Functional-Specific Training.
        2.2.1. In addition to general awareness training, TSPRs must ensure
        personnel/employees who transport HM are trained on local, state, and federal security
        requirements as outlined in the DTR and CFR, to include individual responsibilities.
            2.2.1.1. The 56 LRS/LGRDDC will train assigned traffic management personnel on
            proper procedures for arranging transportation of HM, as indicated in the DTR Part II
            and CFR.
            2.2.1.2. The 56 LRS/LGRDDC will not release shipments to military or commercial
            carriers who are not in compliance with DTR Part II and CFR. The 56
            LRS/LGRDDC will ensure vehicle operators are provided HM response data and safe
            haven information as required in the DTR Part II and CFR.
        2.2.2. The unit TSPR will ensure military and DoD employee motor vehicle operators
        who transport HMs are properly licensed and trained as indicated in the DTR Part II,
        Chapter 204, and AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations. The employee/member must show
        proof of such training when operating a vehicle carrying HM over public highways.
            2.2.2.1. Military members must receive General Awareness/Familiarization Training.
            The Office of HM Safety has prepared training modules that meet the requirements
            for General Awareness Training prescribed in CFR 49, Part 172, Subpart H at
            http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/training/publications/modules.         The TSPR
            may use these modules to train assigned personnel/employees. The TSPR will then
            coordinate with the unit’s Vehicle Control Officer to ensure this HM competency is
            indicated on the AF Form 453, Competency Card. This HM training must be re-
            accomplished every 2 years.
            2.2.2.2. Civilian employees must have a Commercial Drivers License (CDL) with a
            HM endorsement to transport HM over public highways when transporting in such
            quantities that requires the vehicle to be placarded. Civilian employees will purchase
            CDLs at their own expense and obtain any subsequent renewals and endorsements.
     2.3. Security Awareness Training.
        2.3.1. Employees must also be familiar with the provisions outlined in this instruction, to
        include security risks associated with movement and transportation of HM, and the
        importance of reporting suspicious activities to their supervisor and SFS. Each employee
        is responsible for immediately notifying SFS if they suspect a security breach. The TSPR
        must ensure the employee understands the following:
            2.3.1.1. The HM products are essential to industry and the military, but must be
            protected against theft and/or sabotage.
LUKEAFBI24-203 11 OCTOBER 2011                                                              7


       2.3.1.2. The HM are most vulnerable while in transit.
       2.3.1.3. Casual discussions with strangers         regarding   transportation   routes,
       destinations, and types of loads are prohibited.
       2.3.1.4. Ensure increased security of HM in transport by ensuring doors are locked in
       the transport vehicle.
       2.3.1.5. Always verify a vehicle operator’s credentials before loading/releasing HM.
       When questioned about HM transportation, it is important the person’s identity is
       known and that they have a need to know.
