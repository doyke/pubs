(CSB), and large units will utilize the procedures outlined in this instruction and within AFI 36-
2502, Airman Promotion/Demotion Programs. Ensure all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained according to AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of according to the Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims/cfm. Refer recommended changes and

4. Quota/Nominations.
     4.1. Quotas are based on 15 percent of the total TIG and TIS eligible population listed on
     Parts I and II of the quarterly SrA BTZ roster (see Table 2). The MPS Chief determines,
     approves, and distributes quotas to units. Quotas are computed and distributed as follows.
     4.2. Computation. Eligibles multiplied by 15 percent equals the quota. Example: 13
     eligibles x 0.15 = 1.95, or 2 SrA BTZ quotas. (Note: Fractions of 0.5 or higher are rounded
     up.)

Table 2. Distribution.

ELIG QUOTA ELIG QUOTA ELIG QUOTA ELIG QUOTA ELIG QUOTA
*2-6     1            10-16 2            24-29 4            37-43 6              50-56 8
7-9      1            17-23 3            30-36 5            44-49 7              57-63 9
Note: In cases where there are no large units and there are only 2-6 eligibles from all the small
units, the base is authorized to hold a CBB and allowed 1-quota.

     4.3. Quota aggregation is not allowed. Squadron quotas may not be combined to form a
     group. Squadrons will submit eligibles into one combined pool and submit to the CBB.
5. Large Units Procedures.
     5.1. Large units will receive their own quotas and make selections at the unit level.
     Commanders of large units will convene a board and follow the same procedures as the CBB.
     5.2. Large units may nominate individuals for consideration by the CBB with the respective
     commander’s approval. If this option is chosen, large units must relinquish selection
     authority and all quotas to the CBB.
     5.3. Large units must consider all qualified individuals meeting TIG and TIS requirements,
     even if they are TDY, on leave, or have a projected reassignment with a report no later than
     date during or subsequent to the first processing month.
     5.4. Large unit commanders will conduct a review board to select the most qualified
     individuals for SrA BTZ. The review process must be fair and equitable for all individuals.
     If any nominee will not be present for the selection process due to circumstances beyond the
     Airman’s control (TDY, emergency leave, convalescent leave, hospitalization, etc.), the
     board will consider records only. Large units must complete their unit board prior to the date
     the CBB convenes.
     5.5. Once the board adjourns, the convening commander circles the name(s) of the unit’s
     selectees on the SrA BTZ Eligibility List, lines through the names of members non-
     recommended, signs the list with attached minutes (Attachment 3), and returns it to 17
     FSS/FSMPD not later than one duty day prior to the date the CBB convenes. A unit is not
     required to use all quotas if the quality of the nominations is not sufficient to warrant it. If
     any quotas are not used, indicate by annotating the roster before returning to the MPS.
6. Central Base Board/Small Unit Procedures.
GOODFELLOWAFBI36-2502 17 DECEMBER 2013                                                        5

   6.3. After being sworn in by the 17 TRW/CC or designated representative (Attachment 5),

          7.1.3.1. Distributes SrA BTZ quotas each quarter for the CSB.
          7.1.3.2. Convenes a CSB for the 17 TRW/CC to consider all training students that

 6                                       GOODFELLOWAFBI36-2502 17 DECEMBER 2013


        supervisor/first sergeants, etc.) to determine nominee(s) for the CSB. Unit commanders
        circle the name(s) of the nominee(s) on the eligibility list, sign the list, and return it to
        FSMP.
        7.3.2. The CSB will conduct a face board where nominees will be required to physically

        interests of the Air Force.
8. Selection Folders.
     8.1. Selection folders for all SrA BTZ boards will include the SrA BTZ RIP, the nominees’
     AF Form 1206, Nomination for Award, and the Individual Fitness Assessment History.
     Directed by Headquarters EPRs are no longer required for the sole purpose of SrA BTZ
     consideration.
9. Areas Considered.
     9.1. The AF Form 1206 will have the following headings: Leadership and Job Performance
     in Primary Duty, Significant Self Improvement, and Base and Community Involvement.
     Nominations will be limited to 15 lines, not including headings.
10. SrA BTZ Scoring Scale/Selection Phase.
     10.1. Each of the voting board members independently assigns points (6-10) in 1/2 point
     increments (Attachment 4), which are then totaled. When nominees are required to
     physically appear before the CBB, each of the four categories listed in Attachment 2 will be
     given a score in the respective categories. The board member will then place each nominee
     in rank order in the “total” column of the score sheet (Attachment 7). The recorder computes
     the composite score of each nominee by adding the “total” column of each board member.
     Then the recorder lists the nominees in order of merit by ordinal score once the quota is
     applied.
     10.2. The 17 FSS/FSMPD will forward a copy of the CBB/CSB board report (Attachment 3)
     to the 17 TRW/CCC for review and signature.
     10.3. The 17 FSS/FSMPD will forward a copy of the CBB/CSB and large unit promotion
     recommendation letters to 17 TRW/CC or designated representative for approval. The 17
     TRW/CC or designated representative may approve the board’s selections (either in whole or
     only in part) or disapprove the promotion of any Airman whose records do not justify SrA
     BTZ promotion. The 17 TRW/CC may also elect NOT to use the full promotion quota.
     10.4. Once the CBB/CSB and large unit promotion recommendations are approved by the 17
     TRW/CC, the 17 FSS/FSMPD will forward the signed recommendation letters to the 517
     TRG/FSMP and all First Sergeants via email. The 517 TRG/FSMP and First Sergeants will
     notify their respective unit commanders of the board results. The unit commander will then
     ensure all nominees are notified of their final status.
GOODFELLOWAFBI36-2502 17 DECEMBER 2013                                                         7


   10.5. The 17 FSS/FSMPD and 517 TRG/FSMP will project promotions immediately upon
   receipt of 17 TRW/CC signed promotion recommendation letter. This must be accomplished
   prior to the end of the board month.
11. Alternate Selection.
   11.1. Alternates may be selected in the event a selectee is removed or not recommended for
   promotion before the promotion effective date. The 17 FSS/FSMPD will review board
   minutes to determine who the first alternate is and notify the individual’s commander. If the
   commander recommends the alternate for promotion, he/she forwards a letter to the 17
   FSS/FSMPD for the concurrence of 17 TRW/CC or designated representative.
12. Supplemental Consideration.
   12.1. If an eligible Airman was not considered and the error is discovered before the
   promotions are announced, large unit commanders will consider the Airman and adjust
   selections accordingly. The CBB will be reconvened to consider small unit eligibles and
   adjust selections accordingly. If the error is found after the promotions are announced the 17
   FSS/FSMPD will forward a request for supplemental consideration by message to HQ
   AFPC/DPSOE.
