      2.4.1.4. (Added) Coordinate with appropriate civil authorities on problems or adverse

   2.5.1. (Added) Commanders are authorized to acquire, report, process and store information
   concerning persons and organizations, whether or not affiliated with DoD, according to the
   applicable Air Force instructions, which:
      2.5.1.1. (Added) Adversely affect the health, safety, morale, welfare or discipline of

2.6. Off–Limits Establishments and Areas.
   2.6.1. (Added) The establishment of off–limits areas is a function of command. It may be
   used by the 7 BW/CC to help maintain good order and discipline, health, morale, safety and
   welfare of personnel assigned to Dyess AFB. Off–limits action is also intended to prevent
   personnel from being exposed to or victimized by crime-conducive conditions. Where
 8                                                  AFJI31-213_DYESSAFBSUP 15 JULY 2014


     sufficient cause exists, the 7 BW/CC retains substantial discretion to declare establishments
     or areas temporarily off–limits to personnel permanently or temporarily assigned to Dyess
     AFB. Temporary off-limits restrictions issued by the 7 BW/CC in an emergency situation
     will be acted upon by the DDCB as a first priority. As a matter of policy, a change in
     ownership, management or name of any off-limits establishment does not, in and of itself,
     revoke the off-limits restriction.
     2.6.2. (Added) Military members assigned to Dyess AFB are prohibited from entering
     establishments or areas declared off–limits according to this regulation. Violations may
     subject the member to disciplinary action per applicable Air Force instructions and the
     Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Family members of military personnel and others
     associated with the installation should be made aware of off–limits restrictions. As a general
     policy, these establishments will not be visited by personnel in a law enforcement capacity
     unless specifically determined by the 7 BW/CC or board president that visits or surveillance
     is warranted.
     2.6.3. (Added) Except when emergency situations exist, prior to initiating an DDCB action,
     the 7 BW/CC or board president will attempt to correct adverse conditions or situations
     through the assistance of civic leaders or officials.
     2.6.4. (Added) Except when emergency situations exist, prior to recommending off-limits
     restriction, the DDCB will send a written notice (certified mail; return receipt requested) to
     the individual or firm responsible for the alleged condition or situation. In the notice, the
     DDCB will specify a reasonable time for the condition or situation to be corrected, along
     with the opportunity to present any relevant information to the board. If subsequent
     investigation reveals the responsible person has failed to take corrective action, the board will
     recommend the imposition of the off–limits restriction (see Paragraph 2.6.1.).
     2.6.5. (Added) A specified time limit will not be established when an off–limits restriction
     is invoked. The adequacy of the corrective action taken by the responsible individual will be
     the determining factor in removing an off–limits restriction.
     2.6.6. (Added) A person whose establishment or area has been declared off–limits may, at
     any time, petition the president of the board to remove the off–limits restriction. The petition
     will be in writing and will include a detailed report of action taken to eliminate the condition
     or situation that caused imposition of the restriction. The president of the DDCB may direct
     an investigation to determine the status of corrective actions noted in the petition. The board
     will either recommend removal or continuation of the off–limits restriction to the board
     president based on the results of the investigation.
     2.6.7. (Added) Off–limits signs will not be posted on civilian establishments by US military
     authorities.
2.7. (Added) Meetings.
     2.7.1. (Added) The board will meet quarterly. The president of the board may specify
     whether the meetings will be open or closed. Normally proceedings are closed, but may be

  there is substantive information indicating an establishment or area frequented by Dyess AFB
  personnel presents conditions which adversely affect their health, safety, welfare, morale or
  morals. It is essential the board does not act arbitrarily and actions must not be of a punitive
  nature. The board should work in close cooperation with local officials and proprietors of
  business establishments and seek to accomplish their mission through mutually cooperative
  efforts. The board should encourage personal visits by local military and civilian
  enforcement or health officials to establishments considered below standard. The DDCB
  should point out unhealthy conditions or undesirable practices to establishment owners
  or operators to produce the desired corrective action.
  2.11.2. (Added) In cases involving discrimination, the board should not rely solely on
  letters written by the Equal Opportunity (EO) office and Military Affairs Committee or

  2.11.3. (Added) If the board decides to attempt to investigate or inspect an establishment,
  the president or a designee, will prepare and submit a report of findings and
  recommendations at the next meeting. This procedure will ensure complete and documented
  information concerning questionable adverse conditions.
  2.11.4. (Added) When the board concludes that conditions are adverse to military members,
  the owner or manager, will be sent a letter of notification (see Attachment 3). This letter will
  advise him or her to raise standards by a specified date; and if such conditions or practices
  continue, off–limits proceedings will be initiated. Any correspondence with the individuals
  responsible for adverse conditions, which may lead to off–limits action, will be by certified
  mail.
  2.11.5. (Added) If a proprietor takes remedial action to correct undesirable conditions
  previously noted, the board should send a letter of appreciation (see Attachment 4)
  recognizing this cooperation.
  2.11.6. (Added) If undesirable conditions are not corrected, the proprietor will be invited to
  appear before the DDCB to explain why the establishment should not be placed off–limits
  (see Attachment 5). Any proprietor may designate, in writing, a representative to appear
  before the board on his or her behalf.
  2.11.7. (Added) In cases where proprietors have been invited to appear before the board,
  the president of the board will perform the following:
     2.11.7.1. (Added) Prior to calling the proprietor:
         2.11.7.1.1. (Added) Review the findings and decision of the previous meeting.
         2.11.7.1.2. (Added) Call for inspection reports.
         2.11.7.1.3. (Added) Allow those present to ask questions and discuss the case.

         concerning the establishment.
         2.11.7.2.2. (Added) Afford the proprietor an opportunity to present matters in
         defense.
AFJI31-213_DYESSAFBSUP 15 JULY 2014                                                          11


          2.11.7.2.3. (Added) Invite those present to question the proprietor. After the
          questioning period, provide the proprietor an opportunity to make a final statement
          before being dismissed.
   2.11.8. (Added) Deliberations on recommended actions will be in closed session, attended
   only by board members.
   2.11.9. (Added) The board should recommend off–limits restriction only after the
   following:
      2.11.9.1. (Added) The letter of notification (see Attachment 3) has been sent.
      2.11.9.2. (Added) An opportunity for the proprietor to appear before the board has been
      extended.

      made.
   2.11.10. (Added) The minutes will indicate the DDCB’s action in each case. When a
   recommendation is made to place an establishment off–limits, the minutes will show the
   procedural steps followed in reaching the decision.
   2.11.11. (Added) Recommendations of the DDCB will be submitted to the 7 BW/CC for
   approval.
   2.11.12. (Added) Upon approval of the DDCB’s recommendations, the president will write
   the proprietor that the off–limits restriction has been imposed (see Attachment 6).
   2.11.13. (Added) A time limit should not be specified when an off–limits restriction is
   imposed. The adequacy of the corrective action taken by the proprietor of the establishment
   must be the determining factor in removing the off–limits restriction.
   2.11.14. (Added) In emergencies, the 7 BW/CC may temporarily declare establishments or
   areas off–limits to personnel assigned to the 7 BW (see Attachment 7). The circumstances
   for the action will be reported as soon as possible to the DDCB. Detailed justification for
   this emergency action will be provided to the board for its deliberations.
   2.11.15. (Added) The DDCB will publish a list of off–limits establishments and areas using
   7 BW/PA media channels or other available means to insure the widest possible
   dissemination.
2.12. (Added) Removal of Off–Limits Restrictions.
   2.12.1. (Added) Removal of an off–limits restriction requires DDCB action and approval
   by the 7 BW/CC. Proprietors of establishments declared off–limits should be advised that
   they may petition the appropriate DDCB at any time. In their petition, they should submit
   the reason why the restriction should be removed. A letter of notification for continuance of
   the off-limits restriction should be sent to the proprietor if the DDCB does not remove the
   off-limits restriction (see Attachment 8). The DDCB shall appoint a designee who should
   make at least quarterly inspections of off-limits establishments. A statement that an
   inspection has been completed should be included in DDCB minutes.
   2.12.2. (Added) When the board learns the proprietor has taken adequate corrective
   measures, the DDCB will take the following actions:

   off–limit restriction, including a complete address of the establishment or area involved
