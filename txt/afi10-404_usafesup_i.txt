SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision to AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary (BaS&E) Site Planning integrates
the Base Support Plan (BSP) and the Expeditionary Site Survey Process (ESSP) into the plan.
BSPs were formerly known as In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plans (IGESPs). This revision
replaces the previous IGESP/ESP Part I and II chapter attachments and directs the use of HQ
USAF functional community data collection instructions for developing and maintaining
BSP/ESP Parts I and II. This revision assigns the roles and responsibilities of a Major Command
(MAJCOM) to the National Guard Bureau (NGB/A4RX), HQ United States Air Force Academy
(USAFA), and Air Force District of Washington (AFDW).

(USAFE) This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This is a
complete revision of AFI 10-404 USAFE Supplement 1, dated 9 November 2005. This revision
replaces the previous IGESP/ESP Part I and II chapter attachments and directs the use of USAFE
functional community data collection instructions for developing and maintaining BSP/ESP Parts
I and II. It aligns guidance with AFPD 10-4, Operations Planning and AFI 10-404, Base
Support & Expeditionary Site Planning.

  BASE SUPPORT AND EXPEDITIONARY (BAS&E) SITE PLANNING CONCEPTS

1.1. Overview. The Expeditionary Site Survey Process (ESSP) is a subset of the overall
expeditionary site planning process and serves as the foundation for Air Force expeditionary
operations. This AFI is the governing document for ESSP and provides detailed information for
use by planners at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. It also assists site survey teams in
prioritizing their site selection and bed-down actions. The objectives of Base Support Plans
(BSP) and Expeditionary Site Plans (ESP) are to determine installation capabilities and ensure a
well documented, de-conflicted and standardized approach towards bed-down and reception
support for tasked Operations Plans (OPLANs).
1.1. (USAFE)Objectives: Units tasked to develop a base level Operations Plan (OPLAN) will
develop a BSP Part II for each such plan. When published, it will refer to the appropriate
OPLAN annexes and Part 1.
1.2. Products. The expeditionary site planning process produces both a BSP and ESP. BSPs are
primarily developed for locations with a permanent military presence, and are fully developed by
the collaborative planning efforts of many functional experts with a deliberate planning time line.
ESPs are chiefly associated with locations without a permanent Air Force presence and may
contain only the minimum data necessary to make initial bed-down decisions (quick reaction site
survey information in Part I). ESPs may be developed in short time frames to meet contingency
needs without full staffing or coordination. BSPs and ESPs follow the guidance provided in this
AFI. The new ESSP defines the capability and procedures to effectively identify potential
operational locations and collect, store, and access site data in support of combatant commander
decision-making processes. This process will provide decision-makers with substantive and
reliable site survey information essential to performing their jobs well. Furthermore, the
standardization of the process will enable the process to move faster, lead to a greater
understanding of responsibilities at all levels, and greatly improve the quality and usefulness of
expeditionary site planning data.
    1.2.1. Part I of the base support ESP identifies resources and capabilities of a location by
    functional area. For contingency requirements, Part II of the plan allocates resources
    identified in Part I, assesses the ability to support the operation, and identifies limiting factors
    (LIMFACs) in accordance with the intent and direction of the wing commander‘s Time-
    Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD).
    1.2.2. The supporting Numbered Air Force (NAF) will distribute command relationships to
    subordinate wings that reflect command relationships during execution of OPLAN taskings
    for inclusion into Part II of each subordinate wing.
    1.2.2. (USAFE) HQ USAFE will distribute command relationships to subordinate wings
    that reflect command relationships during execution of OPLAN taskings for inclusion into
    Part II of each subordinate wing.
1.3. Processes. Agile Combat Support (ACS) is the ability to field, protect, and sustain air,
space, and cyber forces across the full range of military operations. It is the product of processes
that ready the force, prepare the battle space and position, employ, sustain, and recover the force.
ACS provides for Aerospace Expeditionary Forces (AEF) employed and engaged in operations.

This capability is produced by rapidly deployable, tailored forces executing ACS processes to
bed-down, employ, maintain, protect, and redeploy tactical components of air and space power
and production. As part of ACS, the expeditionary site planning process defines capabilities,
establishes resource allocation, and determines solutions to shortages/limitations. A rigorous
expeditionary site planning process is essential to determine contingency bed-down locations,
deployment requirements, tailoring decisions, and resource allocations. Where existing
capabilities fall short of mission requirements, this process facilitates decisions for successfully
sustaining the mission. The process results are BSP/ESP that define the information necessary
for making bed-down, reception, and deployment-planning decisions. Collaborate planning is
required by all functional areas to create coordinated/integrated ESP results to the maximum
benefit of the process. At the unit level it represents a capability assessment and an employment
plan for the tactical level. For MAJCOM/NAF/Air Component staffs, it quantifies theater/Area
of Responsibility (AOR) support capabilities at the operational level. At HQ USAF, it presents
service level data for strategic level planning and requirements determination.
1.4. Systems Support. The Base Support & Expeditionary (BaS&E) Planning Tool is a suite of
standard systems tools that enable automated, employment-driven, agile combat support
planning. This suite delivers an improved process for campaign planning and course of action
(COA) analysis and selection. It enables a more accurate and expedient identification of
resources as well as critical support requirements for potential bed-down locations around the
world. BaS&E allows for rapid capability and LIMFAC identification, and facilitates force-
tailoring decisions to reduce the deployment footprint. BaS&E consists of four modules on the
Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) and five modules on the Secret
Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) that are mandated for use when they are available
at all levels of command. BaS&E account access will be granted in accordance with
MAJCOM/A4 guidance. At a minimum, security clearances will be verified prior to account
access.
1.4. (USAFE)Systems Support. USAFE Base Support & Expeditionary (BaS&E). BaS&E is a
suite of standard systems tools that enable automated, employment-driven, agile combat support
planning. This suite delivers an improved process for campaign planning and course of action
(COA) analysis and selection. It enables a more accurate and expedient identification of
resources as well as critical support requirements for potential bed-down locations around the
world. BaS&E allows for rapid capability and Limiting Factors (LIMFACs) identification, and
facilitates force-tailoring decisions to reduce the deployment footprint. BaS&E consists of four
modules on the Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) and five modules on
the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) that are mandated for use when they are
available at all levels of command. BaS&E account access will be granted by HQ
USAFE/A4RRO upon receipt of appointment letter. At a minimum, security clearances will be
verified prior to account access.
     1.4.1. Locate and Query Modules: Locate and Query Modules allow users easy access to
     information stored in the BaS&E database. Sites can be selected from a hierarchical tree
     view or by querying the database for sites matching selected parameters. These modules are
     contained within BaS&E NIPRNET and SIPRNET applications.
     1.4.2. Collect Module: The Collect Module will provide users the capability to accomplish
     site data updates. Users will have the ability to utilize a standard set of questions that are
     tailorable to collect site information. Results will be posted to the BaS&E database but
AFI10-404_USAFESUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                                               9


   receive management review before officially being posted to the public. This module is
   contained within BaS&E NIPRNET and SIPRNET applications. It also contains the
   National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Automated Airfield Information File
   (AAFIF), and other information critical to contingency bed-down planning. BaS&E users
   must enter Part I data via the NIPRNET only.
   1.4.2. (USAFE) Collect Module: The Collect Module will provide USAFE users the
   capability to accomplish site data updates. Users will have the ability to utilize a standard set
   of questions that are tailorable to collect site information. USAFE Site Managers will ensure
   all data fields are populated in BaS&E. Results will be posted to the BaS&E database but
   receive management review before officially being posted to the public. This module is
   contained within BaS&E NIPRNET and SIPRNET applications.
   1.4.3. Assess Module: The Assess Module is a decision-support tool developed to enable
   quick COA assessments in the early stages of air campaign planning. It will enable quick
   assessment of the logistical feasibility of supporting varying COAs, to ensure from inception
   that a developed air campaign plan is logistically supportable. This application is contained
   within BaS&E SIPRNET application only.
   1.4.4. User Management Module: This module is for user account management capability
   and ensures role-based permissions are provided according to operation support needs. This
   application is contained within BaS&E NIPRNET and SIPRNET applications.
1.5. ESSP Enablers. Worldwide access to data storage is necessary for accurate planning and
risk analysis of intended expeditionary sites. Planners and surveyors must be able to take
advantage of the Global Combat Support System (GCSS-AF) Air Force Portal and Global
Command and Control System (GCCS). Data collected in the field must be imported to the data
base in time to support impending operations. Planners must have access to the most current data
to advise senior leaders on COAs concerning expeditionary site selection. Data sharing will
eliminate redundancy in collection efforts and help in right sizing deploying forces.
1.6. Integrated Data Collection Tools and Equipment. Collecting data accurately and
reliably requires site survey teams to use standardized tools to support the site survey process.
Functional Data Managers (FDM) will develop and maintain BSP/ESP (Parts I and II). When
identifying installation level resources, capabilities, processes, and procedures, FDMs will use
data collection instructions provided by respective HAF functional communities. Other site
survey checklist data fields not included within BaS&E should be populated within the
miscellaneous field. It is designed to prioritize functional team member actions and facilitate the
sharing of information while preventing duplication of effort. Trained personnel will be able to
utilize these tools to collect integrated site data. The standardized tools focus the team and
optimize activities, especially when time available on site may be limited. MAJCOMs or other
higher headquarters must plan for and acquire the equipment required by their site survey teams.
The headquarters must ensure requirements are identified and submitted as part of the United
States Air Force Program Objective Memorandum (POM) for funding. Each site survey team
will have its own equipment. Equipment should be compatible with current expeditionary site
planning standards and include both functional area-unique and common equipment.
1.6. (USAFE)Integrated Data Collection Tools and Equipment. USAFE Site Managers will
develop and maintain BSP/ESP (Parts I and II). When identifying installation level resources,
capabilities, processes, and procedures, Functional Data Managers (FDMs) will use data

                             ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. General. This chapter describes functional area roles and responsibilities for the planning,
preparation, and execution of the expeditionary site planning and survey processes. Both
processes significantly impact bed-down and campaign plan decisions for all military branches.
Consequently, roles and responsibilities must be clearly defined and unambiguous. Therefore, it
is important that each organization's role is known and understood by all involved. The following
cross-functional responsibilities touch many organizations and agencies and depict the basic
responsibilities of each level of command.
   2.1.1. Cross-Functional Responsibilities for BSP/ESP. Guidance for development and
   maintenance of a BSP or ESP is contained within the functional chapters of this instruction.
   The table of contents identifies the functions and offices of primary responsibility (OPR)
   associated with that function. FDMs are responsible for ensuring the functional content of
   this instruction meets expeditionary site planning objectives.
   2.1.1. (USAFE) See Table A48.1. for USAFE OPRs for each chapter‘s Functional Area
   Manager (FAM) for planning, training and execution. HQ USAFE policy and guidance
   FAMs are noted in each respective chapter to this supplement.
   2.1.2. Cross-Functional Responsibilities for Expeditionary Site Planning Standard Systems
   Applications. The rule-based logic contained in BaS&E is derived from functional area
   policy, technical data, and subject matter expert experience – examples include aircraft
   parking space data, aircraft refueling flow rates, meal consumption data, etc. The checklist
   questions in BaS&E are derived from widely used checklists and functional expert input and
   are only intended to be answered for the development of an ESP Part I. Functional area
   managers are responsible for keeping BaS&E rules and data elements current through
   coordination with AF/A4LX, and the respective MAJCOM/A4 and expeditionary site
   planning OPR as appropriate.
       2.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) HQ USAFE/A4RRO is the OPR for Base Support and
       Expeditionary Site Planning policy and guidance and for United States AFRICA
       Command (AFRICOM) and United States European Command (EUCOM) AORs.
2.2. Logistics Plans and Integration Division (AF/A4LX). Responsible for the Air Force
Expeditionary Site Survey Planning process, policy, and data collection instructions.
   2.2.1. Provide oversight of USAF contingency site survey process. Assists lead MAJCOMs‘
   efforts to de-conflict competing site survey requirements/resources when necessary.
   2.2.2. Exercise management control over the expeditionary site planning program to ensure
   availability of accurate and current data for logistics planning.
   2.2.3. Manage supporting standard systems applications, and is the OPR for BaS&E. Chairs
   the BaS&E Functional Requirements Board (FRB).
   2.2.4. In coordination with all HQ USAF Directorates, establishes data collection
   instructions for each functional area to assist BaS&E users in identifying installation level
   resources and capabilities to develop BSPs and ESPs (Parts I and II).

2.3. MAJCOM/A4 Directorate (Logistics Plans Function). The MAJCOM/A4 will:
   2.3.1. Provide command policy and guidance for implementing BSP and ESP concepts to
   meet their specific missions.
   2.3.1. (USAFE) HQ USAFE/A4RRO provides command policy and guidance for
   implementing BSP and ESP concepts to meet their specific missions.
   2.3.2. Ensure all subordinate bases develop and maintain BSP/ESP Part I. Whenever there is
   a change in POC personnel, the MAJCOM/A4 will immediately designate a replacement and
   provide notice in writing of the new POC to AF/A4LX and the BaS&E PMO. Coordination
   of this requirement with other services may require service component agreements at
   MAJCOM level if the AF unit is a tenant at a Sister Service location.
   2.3.3. Ensure subordinate bases that are tasked to serve as a final destination and/or tasked to
   provide substantial throughput mission via current OPLAN TPFDD develop and maintain a
   BSP Part II. Substantial throughput is defined as the movement of more than 50 personnel
   (PAX) per day and/or 50 short tons of cargo per day over 30 consecutive days. A BSP Part II
   is written for the worst case OPLAN/Concept Plan (CONPLAN) scenario for which the unit
   is tasked. Units should contact their MAJCOM/A4 if they are uncertain about whether their
   OPLAN tasks warrant a BSP Part II. At locations where USAF is not the host component,
   coordination of this requirement with other services may require service component
   agreements at MAJCOM level if the AF unit is a tenant at a Sister Service location.
      2.3.3.1. (Added-USAFE) HQ USAFE/A4R will provide source documents (Table 2.2).
      HQ USAFE/A4RRO will maintain signed copies of all USAFE Main Operating Bases
      (MOBs) BSP Part IIs. MOBs will write a BSP Part II as applicable to current
      OPLAN/CONPLAN taskings. MOBs will forward BSP Part IIs to HQ USAFE/A4RRO
      once completed and signed by Host Wing/Installation Commander.
   2.3.4. Maintain a roster of subordinate bases (including forward operating locations where
   USAF may or may not maintain a presence) that require either a BSP or ESP. Follow the
   format in Figure 2.1.
   2.3.4. (USAFE) HQ USAFE/A4 will maintain a roster of subordinate bases (including
   forward operating locations where the USAF may or may not maintain a presence) that
   require either a BSP or ESP as appropriate. All subordinate units will maintain a BSP Part II
   for each OPLAN/CONPLAN.

  2.3.5. Designate a point of contact (POC), in writing, to AF/A4LX and the BaS&E PMO for
  all MAJCOM related BaS&E base support and expeditionary site planning issues. The
  MAJCOM/A4 POC represents the respective MAJCOM at the BaS&E FRB and is a voting
  member.
  2.3.5. (USAFE) HQ USAFE/A4RRO will designate a point of contact (POC) in writing, to
  AF/A4LX and the BaS&E Program Management Office (PMO) for all MAJCOM related
  BaS&E planning issues. The POC represents the MAJCOM at the BaS&E Functional
  Review Board (FRB) and is a voting member.
  2.3.6. Provide guidance on planning information to subordinate units (i.e., all forces Time-
  Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD), war consumables distribution objective
  (WCDO), War Mobilization Plan (WMP) 3, Part 2, Unit Type Code (UTC) Availability
  (UTA) for WRM UTCs, vehicle authorization list (VAL), and WMP other Volumes,) and
  identify baseline-planning data for BSP/ESP development as required.
  2.3.7. Request MAJCOM functional area support to provide plan inputs for those areas
  where functional expertise does not exist within the subordinate unit or NAF. Where
  appropriate, coordinate with host wing, host wing NAF, and host wing MAJCOM logistics
  plans agencies during review process. Maximize BaS&E applications to expedite and
  standardize overall review process.
  2.3.8. Monitor subordinate unit LIMFAC reports in coordination with the appropriate NAF.
  Staff validated LIMFACs with appropriate MAJCOM/Command functional managers for
  resolution actions. As appropriate, coordinate resolution actions and prioritization of effort
  with MAJCOM senior staff, and NAF(s). Maintain status and issue resolution of all
  LIMFACs.
     2.3.8.1. (Added-USAFE) HQ USAFE/A4 receives potential (LIMFACs) from Base
     Support Planning Committee (BSPC) host for validation. LIMFACs must be classified at
     the General Officer level.
  2.3.9. Develop guidance and procedures for performing staff assistance visits (SAVs) with
  subordinate units as required. The purpose of SAVs is to review the overall expeditionary
  site planning process, provide guidance, clarification, and training. The SAV program should
  be executed in coordination with responsible NAFs (if applicable).
  2.3.9. (USAFE) HQ USAFE/A4 will conduct annual staff assistance visits (SAVs) with
  subordinate units as required. The purpose of SAVs is to review the overall expeditionary
  site planning process, BaS&E compliance, provide guidance, clarification, and training.
  2.3.10. Coordinate with MAJCOM Logistics Compliance Assessment Program (LCAP) or
  Inspector General (IG) to ensure proper evaluation of base support (in-garrison) and
  expeditionary site planning processes and products across all functional areas.
  2.3.11. Manage all MAJCOM related aspects of fielding, using, and sustaining BaS&E
  applications.
  2.3.12. Provide oversight of MAJCOM contingency site survey processes. Develop policy to
  ensure site survey information is collected and stored in BaS&E when possible. Avoid

    duplication of effort, and ensure enough data is collected during site surveys to facilitate bed-
    down analysis with BaS&E as appropriate. Develop and maintain a BSP/ESP Site Survey
    Priority List (SSPL) for near-term (two years) site surveys at locations that are most likely to
    be used for primary missions, humanitarian assistance operations, or unique MAJCOM/AOR
    requirements. SSPLs should be developed in concert with supported commands, subordinate
    units, and contingency taskings. MAJCOMs, DRUs and Centers (AETC, AFMC, AFRC,
    AFSOC, AFSPC, AFGSC, ANG and USAFA) without an AOR are exempt from the SSPL
    report.
    2.3.12. (USAFE) HQ USAFE/A4 will update the Site Survey Priority List (SSPL) annually,
    classify as appropriate, and forward to AFRICOM/J4 and EUCOM/J4. USAFE/A4 will
    work with the AFRICOM and EUCOM planning staff to develop theater-wide SSPLs.

   responsibility.
2.9. The Installation BaS&E Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning OPR (Host
Plans and Integration Function).
2.9. (USAFE)USAFE Installations BaS&E Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning
OPRs.
   2.9.1. Develop and manage the BaS&E base support and expeditionary site planning
   program if required.
   2.9.1. (USAFE) USAFE units will ensure all functional areas are populated in BaS&E,
   prior to annual BSP certification by Host Wing/Installation Commander.
   2.9.2. Manage the BSP LIMFAC reporting program. Forward LIMFACs that are validated
   by BSPC and approved by wing/installation commander to applicable NAF (if no NAF
   exists, provide to MAJCOM/A4) logistics plans function. NAFs (if applicable) will, in-turn,
   forward these reports to MAJCOM/A4 logistics plans function after NAF staff and
   commander review/approval.
   2.9.2. (USAFE) Manage the BSP LIMFAC reporting program. Forward consolidated wing
   LIMFACs that are validated by the BSPC and approved by wing/installation commander to
   USAFE/A4.
      2.9.2.1. (Added-USAFE) LIMFACs should concentrate on wartime or contingency
      operations. Identifying a LIMFAC is a subjective determination made by the unit
      commander or the functional planner. It is important to exhaust all efforts in finding all
      possible options or alternatives before reporting an issue as a LIMFAC.
      2.9.2.2. (Added-USAFE) To ensure resolution to problems receive the appropriate level
      and emphasis, units must be specific in their reports. For example, if there is a shortage
      of a particular vehicle, such as R-9s, do not report a shortage of vehicles. Report a
      shortage of R-9s and be specific as to the impact on mission accomplishment (sortie rate,
      refueling capability to support incoming forces, etc.). Do not lump several problems
      together, since different functional areas may work different parts of a LIMFAC. Ensure
      problems that require construction, additional funds, and storage space are addressed in
      the POM budget submissions, Civil Engineer construction projects, etc.
      2.9.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Use the administrative guidance in AFI 10-404, Attachment
      45 to report LIMFACs.
   2.9.3. Schedule and manage BSPC meetings. Publish minutes signed by BSPC Chair and
   ensure copies are provided to all base agencies, attendees, NAF (if applicable), and
   MAJCOM/A4.

       Mobilization Plan (WMP) Volume 4, Wartime Aircraft Activity (WAA), etc.).
       2.9.5.6. Last two copies of all Inspection Reports (applicable local and higher
       headquarters inspection findings, SAV reports, self-inspection findings, etc.).
       2.9.5.7. LIMFAC program documentation (as applicable).
       2.9.5.8. Miscellaneous (e.g., issues, lessons learned, message traffic, training slides,
       handbooks, and any comments which would add to the understanding of the
       expeditionary site planning process).
       2.9.5.9. Installation BaS&E Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning OPR
       appointment letter.
           2.9.5.9.1. (Added-USAFE) Ensure changes/updates to BaS&E OPR appointment
           letters are forwarded to USAFE/A4RRO.
   2.9.6. Maintain visibility and forward notification of local site survey requirements to
   respective NAF and MAJCOM/A4. Ensure information is validated and loaded into BaS&E.
2.10. Wing/Base Level Units (Including Tenant Units). All commanders and functional area
experts, regardless of command, are responsible for development, management, and review of
their portions of the BSP/ESP (Parts I and II). FDMs will develop and maintain BSP/ESP (Parts I
and II), using data collection instructions provided by respective HQ USAF functional
communities, when identifying installation level resources, capabilities, processes, and
procedures. Unit commanders will appoint (in writing) BSP FDMs and provide a copy to the
Installation BaS&E Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning OPR. BSP FDMs will
maintain continuity books (see paragraph 2.9.5.) to ensure succeeding personnel are aware of
how the chapter was developed (include internal checklists, formulas used, etc.). Coordinate all
site survey requests with Plans and Integration function to prevent duplication of effort and
permit proper prioritization of requirements. Each unit on-base will compare capabilities against
contingency requirements and identify those constraints having a critical negative effect on a
base's war fighting capability. These constraints will be reviewed by the unit commander and
submitted to the plans and integration function for review by the BSPC. LIMFACs are personnel
or materiel deficiencies, problems, or conditions (validated by the BSPC) that have a critical
negative impact on the ability of a unit to perform its wartime mission, and require the aid of
 20                                              AFI10-404_USAFESUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


higher headquarters to resolve. Units will monitor reported LIMFACs and submit updates should
changes occur (e.g., LIMFAC becomes invalid, outdated, etc.). Constraints, which do not meet
BSP LIMFAC criteria, should be identified as such (e.g., constraint, shortfall, etc.) and included
in the plan.
2.11. Installation Exercise/Inspection Function. Wing IG or equivalent agency will establish
a program in cooperation with the installation plans and integration function to assess the
effectiveness and efficiency of the reception and bed-down process on a regular basis. Exercise
scenarios should be based on real-world expectations of simultaneous deployment, reception,
bed-down, and integration of forces. All BSP participants should be involved in building the
exercise scenario. The MAJCOM may determine the scheduling of these exercises and they may
be combined with other local exercises with the agreement of the MAJCOM and
wing/installation commander. Exercise evaluation results will be included in the BSPC minutes.
   2.11.1. Installations tasked with supporting OPLANs in a reception or throughput role are
   required to conduct a bed down brief to synchronize the efforts of all commanders
   participating in the exercise. The brief will be classified in accordance with the level of the
   exercise. The bed down brief will contain at a minimum following data:
       2.11.1.1. Overview of the first 10 days of reception activities (number of inbound
       personnel, short ton totals, inbound air assets based on published TPFDD) (OPR:
       Logistics Readiness Function)
       2.11.1.2. Parking Plan (OPR: Host Airfield Operations function)
       2.11.1.3. De-conflicted operating location and lodging plan (Where airmen will

        Response Group (CRG)) will perform site surveys as directed by HQ USAFE/A4R.
     2.12.6.2. Perform initial site survey to include:
        2.12.6.2.1. Airfield Suitability Survey.
        2.12.6.2.2. Threat Assessment.
        2.12.6.2.3. Pavement Evaluation.
        2.12.6.2.4. Bed-down Assessment.
        2.12.6.2.5. Open, receive, and bed-down forces.
AFI10-404_USAFESUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                                              23


       2.12.6.3. NLT 90 days upon completion of deployment, provide completed after action
       report to program office, through proper coordination channels, and update in BaS&E.
   2.12.7. Air Expeditionary Wings (AEW) and Groups (AEG):
       2.12.7.1. Conduct and complete BSPs or ESPs for these locations.
       2.12.7.2. Deploy and execute assigned missions.
       2.12.7.3. Updates the capability and sustainability of the site in BaS&E.
2.13. Site Survey Team Training. Education and training are critical to the success of this
AFI. Personnel will be trained on the Expeditionary Site Survey Process (ESSP). Those who
collect the data, as well as those who will use the data to plan operations or make decisions, must
understand the overall ESSP and how to exploit its capabilities to the advantage of the Air Force.
   2.13.1. Personnel assigned to the site survey teams should be functional experts. While each
   has the ability to view a site from that individual perspective, the team must be able to see the
   site from the operational perspective – the overall organization, since they may or may not
   know how the site will be used. Beyond AFSC or position-specific training, the Air Force
   must provide training courses for the site survey team (i.e., ESSP Course). The focus of the
   team course will be team synergy – what each member brings to the team as an individual,
   and together, what the team can accomplish through careful planning and interaction.
   2.13.2. All site survey team members, whether assigned to the initial site survey team or
   follow-on team must be trained prior to conducting a site survey. Training may consist of
   attending the ESSP course, an online equivalent or if neither are available, local
   familiarization training appropriate to the functional to prepare BSP/ESP and update BaS&E.
   Air Force leadership and individuals assigned in the planning community must be
   knowledgeable in ESSP, what the site surveys provide, and how to leverage opportunities to
   assist in expanding the data collection effort while maintaining a high level of accuracy.
   Ultimately, when fully operational, the ESSP will provide access to an integrated process that
   is capable of addressing those initial operational questions critical to planning air operations.
   2.13.3. (Added-USAFE) USAFE site survey teams will be comprised of functional experts
   to the greatest extent possible. Team members must be trained on site survey process, by
   either attending the USAF Expeditionary Center ESSP course or local familiarization
   training appropriate to the functional area.

                                           Chapter 3

                                   PLAN DEVELOPMENT

3.1. General. BSP/ESP development is an ongoing process. The total base resources are
identified in Part I of the plan. Part II development generally follows the Joint Chiefs of Staff
(JCS) planning cycle and publication of supporting plans. The baseline planning data for
BSP/ESP development is (1) COMBATANT COMMANDER and supporting OPLANS and
CONPLANS, (2) TPFDDs including all-service data, (3) WAAR, (4) WRM authorization
documents, and (5) contingency in place requirements.
3.2. Plan Timing. The BSP or ESP is not intended to be updated as minor changes occur
throughout the year. However if there are major changes to a base‘s capabilities those changes
need to be reflected in the appropriate chapter of the BSP or ESP in BaS&E. Only the chapter
with the major changes needs to be updated, staffed and approved. As a minimum, units are
required to review/update/re-write BSP/ESPs Parts 1 and 2 annually (not later than one year from
than these were last published), in conjunction with TPFDD updates (Part II only), when there
has been significant change in the unit's support posture. The MAJCOM/A4 may direct
inspections on a more frequent interval. MAJCOMs will baseline the planning cycle by message
traffic to their units to compensate for the problem of different cycles for source documents.
MAJCOMs will interface with supported joint commands to interpret other Services‘ planned
use of AF bases as reflected in the TPFDD, or where USAF is designated host/executive agent
for a location.
   3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) USAFE interfaces with other AFRICOM and EUCOM components
   to coordinate use of USAF host locations.
3.3. Base Support Planning Committee (BSPC). The BSPC is a deliberate planning body
chaired by the wing commander (or equivalent). Its primary function is to actively integrate the
efforts of all base-level organizations involved in preparing a BSP/ESP. The BSPC is the key to
successful expeditionary site planning and must function with senior leadership involvement.
The BSPC will meet annually or more often if necessary to maintain a current BSP/ESP (Part I
or Part II). Locations not tasked to support OPLANs as a throughput or bed-down/reception site
are not required to perform a Part II BSPC meeting. MAJCOMs may dictate or modify
requirements to perform BSPC meetings for Part I updates as necessary).
   3.3.1. Primary members of the BSPC are all wing staff agency chiefs, group commanders,
   unit commanders, tenant unit commanders, FDMs and subject matter experts. On
   installations where a Civilian Personnel Office (CPO) is located, the CPO will be on the
   BSPC. This individual will ensure civilians are accounted for in the BSP/ESP when
   appropriate, satisfy the need for linkage between BSPs and Emergency- Essential,
   Contingency Essential, and Key personnel designations, and provide overall expertise in
   civilian personnel matters.
   3.3.2. When directed to develop or update a Part II, and upon receipt of initial or updated
   planning data, the BSPC will convene to disseminate information and establish timelines and
   requirements to complete the Part II. The BSPC will review contingency in-place
   requirements and other base-level plans that describe contingency or wartime requirements
   and other base support and expeditionary site planning efforts (e.g., installation deployment
AFI10-404_USAFESUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                                            25


   plan). Review wartime and other contingency requirements to identify all aircraft, personnel,
   and equipment competing for base resources. Reviews should include (but are not limited to)
   air base operability actions, reception task force responsibilities, command and control
   structures, facility and utility usage, security requirements, noncombatant evacuation
   planning (including Safe Haven operations), and tenant Base Support Planning involvement.
   The BSPC should consider recommended changes and inputs received from transiting and/or
   employing units for possible incorporation into the BSP to include tenant unit requirements.
   The de-confliction of requirements for competing resources will be determined at the
   appropriate level. Validate and prioritize installation LIMFACs that affect force deployment,
   reception, employment, and overall mission accomplishment.
   3.3.3. Base Support Planning Working Group (BSPWG). The Installation BaS&E Base
   Support and Expeditionary Site Planning OPR (Host Plans and Integration Function) chairs
   Base Support Working Group meetings to discuss the overall status of the BSP Part I,
   conduct BSP FDM training, discuss current issues regarding the operation of the BaS&E
   application. The intent of BSPWG meetings is for the Installation BaS&E Base Support and
   Expeditionary Site Planning OPR to discuss/review with their FDMs any/all BSP or BaS&E
   related issues. The Installation BaS&E Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning OPR
   will publish BSPWG meeting minutes with a list of attendees, discussions, and action items.
3.4. Planning or Refinement Conference/Site Survey. Ideally BSP/ESPs (Part II) are
produced at the point of intended use by the units expected to use them. A combined planning or
refinement conference/site survey held at the employment location with the lead wing and NAF
participating is optimum for locations without permanently assigned major air force units. This
concept also works well at locations where there is a host Air Force unit, and they expect
significant incoming forces. A planning conference at the host unit location can bring together
like-functional representatives from the host and the major incoming units to facilitate resource
allocation.
   3.4.1. (Added-USAFE) USAFE units will conduct refinement or planning conferences for
   BSP Part IIs, based on mission requirements. Host unit locations should include
   representation from NAF/MAJCOM as well as major incoming units, to facilitate resource
   allocation.
   3.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Units that conduct a BSP refinement conference will complete their
   updates and publish an approved BSP Part II, 90 days after conference completion.
3.5. Plan Titles. ESPs and BSPs have standardized titles. The title includes the base/site name
and location, and ―BSP 10-404-XX‖ with XX representing the year the BSP or ESP is published.
Examples: KUNSAN AB, ROK BSP 10-404-11, AL UDEID AB, QATAR BSP 10-404-00 ESP
10-404-01
3.6. Security Classification. BSP/ESP Part I is normally unclassified and marked "For Official
Use Only (FOUO)." BSP/ESP Part II is normally classified based on the OPLANS/CONPLANS
they support – classify Part II according to derivative classification guidance. The BSP and ESP
may have separate unclassified and classified sections, as well as restricted distribution of some
sections, to allow the widest appropriate distribution. At a minimum, mark the plan "For Official
Use Only." If there is a request by a foreign government for BSP/ESP information contact your
local/base Foreign Disclosure office for assistance.
 26                                            AFI10-404_USAFESUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   3.6.1. (Added-USAFE) All USAFE BSP/ESPs will have Foreign Disclosure Office (FDO)
   review, prior to release to a host country.
3.7. Plan Approval. The wing/installation commander or equivalent is the approval authority
for the BSP and ESP and must sign the plan, any subsequent changes or updates, and the
LIMFAC report. The responsible MAJCOM in coordination with the appropriate NAF will
determine approval authority in cases where the wing/installation commander cannot be the
approval authority; i.e., lead wing commander or air force component commander can approve a
BSP or ESP for a site. The commander‘s approval of an electronic generated BSP/ESP from
BaS&E will be documented in the miscellaneous folder, within the General Site Information
Section.
3.8. Plan Distribution. Once BSPs and ESPs are approved, the publishing function (usually
wing or NAF logistics plans function) will generate a message to the MAJCOM/A4 and NAF
logistics plans function (if applicable), and each major deploying unit notifying them of plan
availability based on referenced TPFDD. When appropriate, ensure the U.S. host nation
representative has the opportunity to view applicable BSP/ESP data. Be sure to coordinate this
release with the appropriate Foreign Disclosure Office (FDO) prior to release.
3.8. (USAFE)Plan Distribution. Once BSPs and ESPs are approved, the publishing unit must
provide a copy to USAFE/A4RRO and USAFE/A5 Plans.
   3.8.1. Upon receipt of draft, new or updated BSP/ESPs, deploying units should accomplish a
   plan review and provide recommended changes and comments back to the BSP/ESP OPR.
   3.8.2. Direct correspondence between deploying and reception units is to include courtesy
   copies of message traffic to the respective MAJCOM/A4 and NAF logistics plans agencies as
   applicable.
   3.8.3. (Added-USAFE) HQ USAFE/A4RRO will publish approved ESPs via Share Point
   and CoP. BSP Part IIs will be published via the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network
   (SIPRNet) CoP, for COCOMs and sister service access.
AFI10-404_USAFESUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                                               27


                                            Chapter 4

                                PLAN CONTENT GUIDANCE

4.1. Format. BSP/ESPs currently use a two-part format. Part I outlines base/installation
capabilities and total resources. As a minimum, MAJCOM/A4s will ensure all units capture
BaS&E data elements in Part I. MAJCOMs are responsible for ensuring the complete BSP/ESP
is accessible via the AF Portal and is available to AF and sister service Functional experts. Part II
depicts contingency requirements and allocates resources identified in Part I, assesses the ability
to support the operation, and identifies LIMFACs. Units must follow the content outlined in this
instruction‘s attachments and BaS&E. Deviations are authorized where the information in the
attachment does not apply. The process should result in a plan with the complete range of
information necessary to identify wartime requirements and procedures, and the resources
necessary to fulfill the requirements. In general, content should be detailed enough for a newly
assigned individual to understand what must be done and how to do it.
4.1. (USAFE)Format. HQ USAFE/A4 is responsible for ensuring all AFRICOM/EUCOM
completed BSP and ESPs are accessible via NIPRNET (Part I) and SIPRNET (Part II) and
available to Air Force and sister services. All BSPs and ESPs will be loaded in BaS&E.
4.2. Specific Content Guidance. Data entry fields within the BaS&E Planning Tool chapters
differ in some cases from the HQ USAF functional community data collection instructions.
Functional Data Managers (FDM) will develop and maintain BSP/ESP (Parts I and II), using
data collection instructions provided by respective HQ USAF functional communities, when
identifying installation level resources, capabilities, processes, and procedures. When necessary,
the ―miscellaneous notes‖ area in all BaS&E chapters will be used to include any information not
covered by a data entry field. Units are encouraged to develop operating instructions, checklists,
and other supporting documentation to aid in plan development and execution and to address
unique situations. When a Part II is required, the supporting OPLAN/CONPLAN will be
identified in the general site information chapter. Tenant unit equipment and resources will be
incorporated in the appropriate section of the BSP/ESP (Parts I and II).
4.2. (USAFE)Specific Content Guidance. Title BSP Part II, ―XXX AB, Base Support Plan.‖
Include MAJCOM-specified Plan ID in Part II.
   4.2.1. All resources and/or capabilities residing on an Air Force installation, regardless of
   service (Army, Navy, Marine Corp, Coast Guard) or component (Active duty, Guard, or
   Reserve) will be documented in the BSP Part I. In-turn, all contracted and/or out-sourced
   (i.e., A-76) agency resources and capabilities residing on an Air Force installation will be
   documented in the BSP Part I.
   4.2.2. At joint reserve base locations, the lead Air Force plans function will be responsible
   for completing the BSP Part I and II (if required) without regard to who is actually the lead
   service at that installation.
4.3. The ESSP Expeditionary Site Survey Process. The ESSP Expeditionary Site Survey
Process is a subset of the ESP process. It is composed of three primary interactive sub-processes.
As shown in Figure 4.1., these are site selection, data collection, and storage and access.
Although inter-related, each sub process has its own distinct purpose.
 28                                              AFI10-404_USAFESUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


Figure 4.1. Overview – ESSP Process




   4.3.1. Sub-Process 1: Site Selection. Site selection consists of two, interrelated processes
   based on when a site is identified as a potential operating location. Air Force component
   command staffs will work with Combatant Commanders and Air Mobility Command
   planners to assess operating locations in support of the Combatant Commander planning
   directives such as the theater engagement plan. A site may be one of several identified and
   prioritized on a list by the component command, IAW its site selection criteria, in the pre-
   conflict period. It can also be identified as part of the course of action (COA) development
   phase during crisis action planning. It is incumbent upon the component command to actively
   seek opportunities to conduct site surveys in a deliberate planning mode. This process of
   early engagement will facilitate the planning and execution process as well as facilitate
   relationships with country teams in those locations not routinely visited by AF personnel.
   4.3.2. Sub-process 2: Data collection. The data collection sub-process is the heart of the site
   survey process. It is composed of three distinct components - pre-site survey, site survey, and
   post-site survey as illustrated in Figure 4.2. The pre-site survey consists of actions taken by
   the team before departing home station for the site. Functional experts perform pre-site
   survey tasks such as researching the selected site via the NIPRNET or SIPRNET.
   Additionally, they will obtain prior surveys, and ESPs expeditionary site plans if available,
   obtain common installation picture and other maps and imagery of the location, and contact
   the Air Force component command and Combatant Command country teams for information
   and assistance as necessary. The site survey, which consists of actions accomplished while
   the team is deployed to the location. When notified, the site team deploys to a location to
   conduct the site survey. During the site survey the team obtains site-specific physical
   characteristics and site capability data. Additionally, the teams may be required to make
   basic assessments regarding the site‘s suitability for flight operations in support of any Air
   Force mission. The checklists (in BaS&E) will guide the site survey teams and planners to
   perform an operational assessment of a site. Information collected during the site visit must
AFI10-404_USAFESUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                                             29


   be stored in BaS&E and subsequently analyzed to generate four primary products for use by
   planners during the post-site survey phase--airfield suitability assessment, CBRNE threat and
   vulnerability assessment, pavement evaluation, and an initial bed-down assessment. The
   post-site survey phase consists of actions taken by the team after departing the survey
   location. During this phase actions would include updating an integrated framework and
   further development of integrated CIP using Expeditionary Site Mapping (ESM) capabilities.
   Teams may be required to generate written reports as necessary to meet theater requirements.
   In-depth feasibility assessments may be accomplished during the post-site survey timeframe
   to ascertain the most effective mission type for the site. Analysis and information generated
   by an assigned mission by functional experts determine the long-term capability of a site‘s
   supportability. This analysis identifies what additional items and personnel are required to
   execute and sustain a mission, i.e. the generation of in-to-plane contracts for fuel support or
   the development of an acquisition cross-servicing agreement with the host-nation.

Figure 4.2. Data Collection Sub-Process




Determining that an airfield is capable of supporting flight operations is paramount to successful
accomplishment of a site survey. Appropriate MAJCOM/A3 staff will perform an assessment on
the Site Survey Team‘s Airfield Suitability Survey data and approve or disapprove the site for
their MAJCOM specific air operations. The assessment procedure (Figure 4.3.) is typical across
the MAJCOMs and addresses all Air Force aircraft and the full spectrum of operational missions.
Decisions for potential use will be made available to the combatant commander with notes on
which specific aircraft can operate from the FOL, limitations, and other appropriate comments.
Additionally, decisions not to use the site for future operations based on the airfield suitability
assessment will be identified.

Figure 4.3. Airfield Suitability Assessment




   4.3.3. Sub-Process 3: Data Storage and Access: Storage of data and access to the data, by
   authorized personnel is paramount to advancing the site survey process. Data collected by the
   site survey teams must be managed in a fashion that allows data sharing opportunities,
   provides methods for easy yet secure access, and rapid analysis. The methodology for
   building data communications or information technology (IT) systems is well defined by the
   DOD and the Air Force. The DOD and the Air Force have established direction in the form
   of policies, guidance, and standards for the acquisition and implementation of IT systems. All
   IT systems are designed on a specific architecture that includes an Integrated Framework.
   The Integrated Framework is comprised of layers: Tech Services, Integration Services, and
   Infrastructure. The Tech Services layer is the only layer of the integrated framework that
   most customers of site survey data will reference. The components of the Tech Services layer
   provide the storage of, and access to data. The Web Services component will provide web
   pages with integrated applications allowing users to search (query) databases for site
   information and then deliver the results of the search in predefined reports or user-defined
   (ad-hoc) reports. Links to archives and archive search engines will also provide users with
   information not typically stored in databases (e.g., after-action and lessons-learned reports).
   The goal of the Web Services component is to become the one-stop shopping point, or Web
   broker, of site survey data. Other components of the Tech Services layer address, security,
   load balancing of customers accessing Web Services, and databases. The ESSP Program
   Manager (AF/A4LX) must continuously search for opportunities to enhance data
   management by seeking out and collaborating with Program Managers of systems that store
   site information. Data sharing between databases must be examined and established to
   minimize duplication of data stores and collection efforts.

                                             Chapter 5

                            CONTINGENCY/ESSP SITE SURVEY

5.1. General. AFI 10-503, Strategic Basing, implements AFPD 10-5, Basing, and provides
guidance for conducting site surveys for permanent bed-down of a unit or mission on real
property. It is not applicable to site surveys for determining locations to support survival
recovery and reconstitution plans, exercises, and contingencies. This AFI sets guidance for
conducting site surveys that are collectively termed contingency site surveys. In the context of
expeditionary site planning, a site survey is defined as the physical investigation of a location to
gather data in support of a planned or possible contingency operation. Site surveys are conducted
for any or all of the following purposes: (1) To determine the feasibility of a location for planned
operations; (2) To validate information about equipment, terrain, host nation resources, and
infrastructure such as serviceability, availability, compatibility, etc. (3) To gather critical
information for future operations and facilitate planning for the eventual use of a location.
5.2. Concept. Site surveys are an integral part of the expeditionary site planning process.
Information gathered during a survey on a site‘s resources and capabilities are captured in the
ESP Part I, and an analysis of the information facilitates resource allocation in Part II of the plan.
   5.2.1. Site surveys are accomplished during deliberate and crisis action planning. In both
   circumstances enough information must be collected to avoid the need for repeat visits.
   BaS&E has three modes or chapter checklists for gathering data. A full site survey, or BSP
   consists of all site survey information arranged into separate functional chapters residing in
   the Expeditionary Site Plan (ESP) and Quick Reaction Survey (QRS). The QRS opens only
   those chapters that must be completed when time is critical. Surveys viewed or authorized for
   checkout in QRS mode will contain all bed-down capability assessment data elements.
   Additionally, only those data elements that are mission critical will be active and allow
   personnel to enter data. . Elements that are not time critical will be disabled or "grayed out."
   An ESP consists of site survey information and support documents. Site survey data collected
   and stored in BaS&E as an ESP Part I, enables planners‘ worldwide access to the data for
   bed-down planning, assessment, and familiarization. The QRS and ESP checklists are
   available in BaS&E.
   5.2.2. In addition to known operating locations identified in contingency plans, site surveys
   should be conducted at other possible bed-down sites to better prepare air expeditionary
   forces for operations in unfamiliar and austere locations. MAJCOM/A4s and NAFs in a
   component role should identify locations within their AOR as the most likely candidates for
   conducting contingency operations to include humanitarian relief operations. Locations will
   be determined from theater engagement plans, Combatant Commander‘s staff inputs,
   intelligence information, etc. and prioritized for accomplishing actual site surveys. The
   process of identifying possible bed-down sites and surveying them is an ongoing effort. The
   list of locations must be continuously reviewed and new locations surveyed as changing
   world conditions drive new requirements.
5.3. Authorization. The MAJCOM/A4 plans and integration function or designated
organization provides oversight for all site surveys in their AOR. Permission to conduct site
surveys must be granted by this central MAJCOM authority prior to the actual visit. This process
 32                                                AFI10-404_USAFESUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


minimizes duplication of effort (multiple visits to the same location), facilitates proper storage of
critical information (ESP update in BaS&E), and ensures surveys are accomplished in priority
order. Units conducting site surveys outside of their AOR should request permission through
their own MAJCOM/A4 plans and integration function or designated organization.
   5.3.1. (Added-USAFE) All USAFE site surveys will be conducted as a team, and not
   individual functional areas to greatest extent possible. Enough site information should be
   collected, to avoid multiple visits. USAFE/A4RRO is the focal point for coordinating site
   surveys, and team composition.
5.4. Site Survey Team. The mission dictates site survey team member selection. Efforts should
be made to include functional area subject matter experts (SME) of sufficient experience and
rank from the lead wing or major deploying units. Site survey team members using BaS&E must
be trained on the application (see 2.13.2). Figure 5.1. provides a suggested site survey team
composition; however, the mission and purpose of the site survey will determine the team size,
composition, rank structure, and specific experience required in each functional area. When
multiple MAJCOMs have operational responsibility at the same location they each may be
granted permission to field a site survey team (i.e. the same location has both AMC throughput
mission and ACC aircraft bed-down missions), but team size should be limited to the maximum
extent possible and cross utilization of personnel is encouraged.
   5.4.1. (Added-USAFE) AOR specific (AFRICOM/EUCOM) site surveys and mission,
   dictate team composition and number of personnel authorized by host country. Team
   composition may include personnel from non-USAFE agencies (i.e. USTRANSCOM) as
   mission dictates.

5.5. ESSP Integrated Site Survey Team Composition. The ESSP is composed of two types of
teams – a dedicated initial site survey team and the follow-on team. The differences reflect their
respective focus and products. Future site survey teams will have defined roles, an established
team composition, and a defined product, thus eliminating any confusion as to what is expected
of the teams. The initial site survey team is responsible for production of basic essential data
related to the site including threat assessment, airfield suitability survey, pavements evaluation,
and bed down assessment. The follow-on team however, will be mission specific and will focus
on the data that are pertinent to the success of the given operation. These teams will be groups of
highly trained individuals who have a working knowledge of the process and the deliverables.
Tools will be used that will expedite their efforts, and prioritized actions will ensure time onsite
is optimized. Site survey teams will provide planners and leaders with decision-quality
information.
   5.5.1. Initial Site Survey Team (ISST). The cadre of personnel must be trained and capable
   of producing products. Although the ISST is limited to specific functional areas, it by no way
   implies that other functional areas do not facilitate the site survey process. Team limitations
   are a result of scope, time, and country restrictions. If the scope of site survey exceeds the
   capability of the ISST, MAJCOMs and component commands should make accommodations
   to the team composition but not to the detriment of producing the aforementioned ISST
   products.
   5.5.2. The Follow-on Team. The follow-on team should conduct detailed analysis of the
   information available on the site/country and determine what additional information is
   required to successfully execute the anticipated assigned mission. This team may consist of
   functional experts from the Open the Base Force Module and typically either the component
   command, Contingency Response Group (CRG), and air expeditionary group/wing and
   associate units, or a combination of all of the above. The focus of this team is methodical
   data collection as it pertains to a specific mission and that site. To do this, the team will
   determine the access and availability of host nation resources, capability of the site and host
   nation ability to sustain operations, identify shortfalls/LIMFACS and potential workarounds
   for each, and develop a site bed-down plan. The follow-on team is required to produce the
   final ESP.
   5.5.3. Role of Team Chief (Responsibilities and Duties). The Team Chief is the senior Air
   Force Operations Planner/Logistics Planner on any site survey team and is responsible for the
   success of the survey and will verify any data collected by his/her team. This person must be
   capable of interacting with high-ranking officials of other services and nations. The team
   chief must have the capability and authority to make high-level decisions. This individual
   should understand Air Force operational capabilities as well as logistical implications of
   bedding down various Air Force forces. The team chief should have an extensive working
   knowledge of the various key functional areas and their minimum needs to bed-down forces.
   The team chief is responsible for several key functions within the site survey process. Duties
   of the team chief include, but are not limited to those identified in Figure 5.2.

within 40 days of site survey completion if at a deployed location
   5.5.4. Qualifications of Team Members. Team members will be worldwide qualified to
   perform the duties for which they are assigned. In all cases, when assigned to or identified as
   site survey team members, personnel will be trained on policies, processes, procedures, and
   the use of specific site survey tools used for data collection, storage, and access. All site
   survey team members tasked to conduct site surveys will comply with the following general
   requirements (as directed by MAJCOM/A4):
       5.5.4.1. Team members must possess a valid U.S. Passport and Visa.            Consult the
       Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG).
       5.5.4.2. Completed ESSP Course team member training. This requirement can be
       accomplished through familiarization training if ESSP course attendance or equivalent is
       not possible.

Aerial Port—An airfield that has been designated for the sustained air movement of personnel
and materiel as well as an authorized port for entrance into or departure from the country where
located.
Agile Combat Support (ACS)— Agile Combat Support (ACS) is the ability to field, protect,
and sustain air, space, and cyber forces across the full range of military operations to achieve
Joint effects.
Air Terminal—A facility on an airfield that functions as an air transportation hub and
accommodates the loading and unloading of airlift aircraft and in-transit processing of traffic.
The airfield may or may not be designated an aerial port.

Area of Responsibility (AOR) Manager—The AOR Manager is the MAJCOM BSP Manager.
They manage the Site Manager permissions/access for the sites within their respective AOR.
This roll is applicable on both NIPRNet and SIPRNet versions of the application.
Base Support and Expeditionary (BaS&E) Site Planning Tool—A NIPRNET/SIPRNET-
based suite of standard systems tools that enables automated, employment-driven, agile combat
support planning. BaS&E supports the and expeditionary site planning process by accurately and
rapidly identifying resources and combat support requirements at potential employment
locations, providing bed-down capability analysis and LIMFAC identification, and facilitating
force tailoring decisions to reduce the overall deployment footprint. BAS&E consists of three
components that are mandated for use when they are available at all levels of command.
BaS&E User— A BaS&E user has read only access. They will not be able to access the Collect
Module. This roll is applicable on both NIPRNet and SIPRNet versions of the application.
Base Support Plan (BSP)—Primarily developed for locations with a permanent Air Force
presence, and are fully developed by the collaborative planning efforts of many functional
experts with a deliberate planning time line. Replaces the former term In-Garrison Expeditionary
Site Plan (BSP). All plans formerly called BSP will be re-designated BSPs. The term BSP
describes all plans developed to meet deliberate planning requirements, contingency planning
requirements, and any other site planning requirements. While the term BSP is superseded; the
requirement for robust, structured, and standardized site planning based on AFI 10-404 remain.
Base Support Planning Committee (BSPC)—A planning body chaired by the installation
commander (or equivalent) to facilitate the development of the BSP (normally comprised of
senior level leadership). The BSPC serves as the focal point for plan development and reports to
the commander on the status of plans. It integrates the numerous base-level requirements and
functional support actions to present a coordinated overview of activity in the. This committee
was formerly known as the In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Planning Committee (BSPC).
Combatant Commander—A commander of one of the unified or specified combatant
commands established by the President. Also called CDR. See also combatant command;
specified combatant command; unified combatant command. (Approved by JMTGM # 076-
2864-94)
Expeditionary GeoBase and GeoReach—GeoReach is the process to enable analysis of
potential forward sites using geospatial information to provide planners and Airmen with the
capabilities for vastly improved FOL selection. Expeditionary GeoBase is enabled via
GeoReach, and is a forward deployed version of Garrison GeoBase capabilities, affording
provisional commanders and airmen enhanced situational awareness of the expeditionary base.
Expeditionary Site Plans (ESP)—ESPs are chiefly associated with locations without a
permanent Air Force presence and may contain only the minimum data necessary to make initial
bed-down decisions. ESPs may be developed in short time frames to meet contingency needs
without full staffing or coordination. It is the installation level or site plan to support unified and
specified command wartime operations plans, as well as MAJCOM supporting plans. It cuts
across all functional support areas in a consolidated view of installation missions, requirements,
capabilities, and limitations to plan for actions and resources supporting war or contingency
operations, including deployment, post-deployment, and employment activities (as appropriate).

access to standard, accurate and current geospatial information for all Air Force installations,
ranges and property. GeoBase enables geospatial analysis and the integration into business
processes of USAF missions, installations, and facilities. GeoBase is comprised of four unique
decision support environments: Garrison GeoBase, Expeditionary GeoBase, GeoReach, and
Strategic GeoBase.
Limiting Factor.—A factor or condition that, either temporarily or permanently, impedes
mission accomplishment. (Joint Pub 1-02) {Has a critical negative impact on the ability of a unit
to perform its wartime mission, and require the aid of higher headquarters to resolve.}Used in
this publication for clarity.
MAJCOM/A4 Plans and Integration Function—Provides command policy and guidance for
implementing and expeditionary site planning concepts to meet their specific missions.
Program Management Office (PMO)— The PMO manages and sustains programs in
accordance with cost, schedule, and impact. They are the BSP subject matter experts and
provide Tier 2 helpdesk field assistance.
Site Survey—The physical investigation of a location to gather data in support of a planned or
possible contingency operation.
Site Manager— The Site Manager is the Host Wing LRS/LGRRP who manages the site review.
They manage the Functional Data Manager‘s permissions/access. This roll is applicable on both
NIPRNet and SIPRNet versions of the application
Strategic GeoBase—Looks at broader geospatial imagery to understand the proximity of cities,
geographical landmarks, and other areas of interest. This information is used in collaboration
with the more specific GeoBase garrison data to gain a more complete picture of the operating
location.
Supported Command—The command having primary responsibility for an operation under an
OPLAN or contingency. (Definition used for this pub only)
Supporting Command—A command providing augmentation forces or other support to another
(supported) command. (Definition used for this pub only)

   provided immediate protection from the effects of enemy attack, adequate living and working
   facilities; and arranging for the expeditious movement of arriving equipment to unit work
   areas. Reception begins at the Port of Debarkation (POD). Theater reception is the process of
   receiving personnel and materiel in the theater. It establishes the in-theater accountability,
   and initial sorting of units, unit equipment, personnel, and materiel. Staging occurs when unit
   personnel are married with their equipment in a controlled area. Theater sustainment materiel
   is segregated, prioritized, and prepared for transport to the required locations. Onward
   movement is the coordinated actions of allocating road space, transportation assets (air,
   ground, inland, and rail) and support requirements for the unit and/or materiel. Additionally,
   vehicle allocations need to be accomplished in an orderly fashion.
   A8.1.2. Provide a general overview of the Unit/Individual Reception Process. A simple
   summary of the reception flow for equipment, personnel, and weapon systems should be
   used. This should be clear enough that personnel arriving could use the summary to
   understand what to do upon arrival at a base through actual bed-down.

   reception process from the point that personnel arrive at the base through their arrival at
   temporary quarters. Ideally units are met by like host units, e.g. an inbound civil engineer
   team would be met by someone from the civil engineer squadron. Describe the modifications
   to the process (if any) that occur should the installation come under attack and/or become
   chemical biological contaminated during reception activities.
   A8.4.2. Describe the process for in-processing arriving cargo. Describe the process by which
   cargo (uncontaminated and contaminated) for arriving units is received and moved to the
   appropriate location on-base. This process should include a method for inbound unit
   equipment custodians to travel with the cargo and then be processed through the reception
   line when their equipment is properly stored in the bed-down work area. Units may include
   the handling procedures for contaminated cargo in this chapter or provide appropriate
   references to the CBRNE annex.

                       AIRFIELD LOADING PARKING (BAS&E CH 8)

Note: This chapter should be developed with the assistance of representatives of major deploying
units during Part II planning conferences/site surveys. Use of standard civil engineer Global
Geospatial Information System (GIS) mapping programs is encouraged for developing aircraft
parking plan maps. See chapter 50 for specific guidance.

PART I: IS NOT DEVELOPED FOR THIS CHAPTER

PART II:
A10.1. Describe the aircraft-parking plan for the primary war mission of the base. (Use the
Contingency Airfield Parking Planner (CAPP). Normally, the completed plan is classified.
Include all employing and transient combat and cargo aircraft. Identify loading/unloading spots
and hot pit refueling areas; ensure all explosives loading, unloading, parking areas are sited and a
risk assessment performed and if necessary ensure commander was briefed on risk assessment.
Depict specific use of all shelters, revetments, hardstands, and ramp areas by planned aircraft.
Highlight the situation if space in aircraft shelters exceeds aircraft assets, and ensure these extra
shelters are utilized for critical asset protection (fuel trucks, bomb jammers, etc.). Portray
emergency parking areas such as taxiways, secondary runways, airfield matting, commercial
facilities, and current host parking areas, as these areas may require use during survivability
actions. Coordinate the plan with operations, security forces, civil engineers, maintenance, fire
department, fuels, communications, and safety.)
A10.2. Describe all shortfalls.
A10.3. Miscellaneous Notes. Include the following information in the miscellaneous notes
section.
   A10.3.1. The airfield loading/parking plan is crucial to managing the physical flow of
   aircraft through the base, especially when airlift and tactical operations occur concurrently.
   Maintaining a smooth and orderly flow is important to the expeditious turnaround of airlift
   assets and minimizing exposure of aircraft and personnel to possible enemy action. Depict all
   aircraft including in-place, transient, and incoming aircraft regardless of origin. This
   information is used to identify peak load periods for the base during contingency operations
   and facilitates effective evaluation of support capability and requirements.
   A10.3.2. Use the WAA to depict consecutive airfield loading by MDS and MOG. The
   following format is suggested:

PART I:
A11.1. Concept of Operations
   A11.1.1. Summarize the plan to handle and process US citizens and designated foreign
   nationals for Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO), to include operations in a
   CBRNE environment if the threat exists. Define the scope of required actions by indicating
   specific activities (e.g., identification, marshaling, and evacuation) applicable to the plan.
   Although the personnel community is responsible for preparing this portion of the BSP/ESP
   (which includes both establishment and implementation of procedures during actual
   operations), numerous other agencies play important roles and their responsibilities cannot be
   overlooked. Thus, logistics plans, force support, security forces, OSI, comptroller, public
   affairs, logistics readiness, Emergency Management personnel, POLAD/International
   Relations office are OCRs in the development of NEO planning and should provide the
   personnel office with operational procedures pertaining to their specific functions (e.g., Force
   Support will plan lodging requirements, and identify airlift/sealift evacuation procedures,
   etc.).
   A11.1.2. Summarize the plan to handle and process US citizens and designated foreign
   nationals Safe Haven operations, to include operations in a CBRNE environment if the threat
   exists. Define the scope of required actions by indicating specific activities (e.g.,
   identification, marshaling, and evacuation) applicable to the plan. Although the personnel
   community is responsible for preparing this portion of the BSP/ESP (which includes both
   establishment and implementation of procedures during actual operations), numerous other
   agencies play important roles and their responsibilities cannot be overlooked. Thus, logistics
   plans, services, security forces, OSI, comptroller, public affairs, logistics readiness,
   Emergency Management personnel, etc., are OCRs in the development of NEO planning, and
   should provide the personnel office with operational procedures pertaining to their specific
   functions (e.g., Force Support will plan lodging requirements, and identify airlift/sealift
   evacuation procedures, etc.).

operations. Lodging should provide the expected number of personnel in commercial
lodging/contract quarters and approximate distance from the installation.

A17.7.7. . Alternate Permanent Facilities: Under emergency conditions, other types of buildings
besides dormitories and transient quarters may be used. Types of buildings that may be suitable
for such purposes are fitness centers, warehouses, and hangars, provided toilets and showers are
available. In areas where CBRN threats exist and/or the climate is very cold or hot, the adequacy
of personnel protection and the availability of heating and cooling systems in these facilities
should be considered.

A17.7.8. . Family Housing: As a last resort, family housing units may be used to house transient
people. In overseas areas where a NEO program is to be implemented in wartime to evacuate
dependents and US citizens, using family housing is a viable way to provide housing for NEO
evacuees. Such a plan will house incoming NEO families and unaccompanied personnel in
family quarters vacated by families already evacuated. Families not yet evacuated may be asked
to house NEO personnel in their quarters on a voluntary or even mandatory basis in wartime.
Family housing should be used for transient unaccompanied personnel only when no other
practical alternative exists. The wing commander will determine whether family housing will be
used for lodging. In instances where a CBRNE threat exists and family housing is used for NEO
operations, services personnel will distribute Shelter-In-Place procedures, describing how to
transform the living quarters into a protective shelter until personnel can be evacuated. Refer to
the NEO chapter of the BSP for additional information. Facilities under construction. For
planning purposes, include facilities under construction and respective estimated completion
dates.

and noncombatants awaiting evacuation or onward movement. Identify available and required
facilities, to include clubs, equipment, rations, and personnel, as well as sources of supply.
Include troop issue operations. After coordinating with appropriate functional managers,
prioritize the listing of food service facilities in the order that will support the plan. Appropriated
and non-appropriated facilities should have the highest priority.
A17.22. From the TPFDD, determine the total base population (including US/Local National E-
E, Key and Contingency Essential civilians) to be supported. In actual wartime, and especially at
isolated locations, 90% of meal cardholders and separate ration personnel may eat in base dining
facilities. This planning factor is based on the base workload, number of hours people are on-
base (if applicable), the security threat of the base, and consumption data (ref AFMAN 10-401,
Planning Formats And Guidance, Vol 2).
   A17.22.1. Compare the figure above with the total emergency feeding capacity calculated in
   Part I to determine if additional feeding support is required.
   A17.22.2. If the base population to be supported is smaller than the emergency capacity,
   determine which facilities will be used, the number of hours of operations required, and
   include in the plan. If other than appropriated funded facilities are to be used, they will be
   operated as an appropriated funded facility and the base food service will be responsible for
   the management and will ensure the augmentation scheduled for the base food service is
   sufficient to support these facilities.
   A17.22.3. If the base population exceeds the food service capability, review the appropriate
   TPFDD to determine if field kitchens are scheduled for the base. If they are, include the
   capability in the plan. Determine the number of people the field kitchens will support and
   compare against the shortage.
A17.23. Determine the amount of potable water required for each food service facility using
their emergency capacity as a baseline. Use a figure of 10 gallons of water per person per day for
each food facility. Transportation of emergency potable water is to be arranged through the BCE
planner and reflected in the plan.
A17.24. Provide a list of rations sources, POCs for rations and plans on how to move rations
from resupply point.

will be prepared at __________ building, as required.
A17.26. List procedures for reimbursement if different from normal.
A17.27. Provide details about supplying rations for hospital patients. (Subsistence and facility
planning should be based on providing three prepared meals per day to 90% of the patients in the
Military Healthcare Facility (MHF), 100% of any convalescent patients and 100% of the aero
medical staging facility (ASF) patient capacity. Ten percent (10%) of the MHF patients will not
be receiving meals for health care reasons. Flight meals will be needed for AME patients based
on the number of evacuees per day. Medical diet technicians determine and order medical unique
rations items, and transport meals to medical facilities).
A17.28. Lodging Information. Determine the total number of people requiring lodging. (Using
the latest approved all-services TPFDD, compute the following data that will be used to
determine the total number of people requiring lodging. This formula does not take into account
non-combatants awaiting evacuation or onward movement.)

(*Include personnel living off-base who, under contingency/wartime conditions, would require
on-base lodging. Include E-E civilian employees remaining at the installation who would require
on-base lodging. **By C-Day, include transiting forces that require temporary lodging.)
A17.29. Specify how housing services will be provided on a 24-hour basis in the
order/sequence/priority of actions to be taken. Develop a plan/agreement to ensure that the civil
engineers will provide personnel during the execution of this plan to issue keys for the buildings
that they manage (dormitories, family housing, etc.).
A17.30. Describe how augmentation personnel will be used to expand sleeping areas, and
provide 24-hour lodging and linen exchange service.
   A17.30.1. During initial stages of plan implementation, the lodging NCOIC, the CES
   furnishings management supervisor, and civilian/local national personnel assigned to lodging
   will begin 12-hour shifts on a 24-hour basis, effective C-day.
   A17.30.2. _________ military shift supervisors in lodging and local national/civilian
   temporary augmentees from other less essential base functions (specify) will be provided on
   C-day to assist in 24-hour a day lodging assignments, linen/bedding issues, and furnishings
   placement during initial stages of unit arrivals.
   A17.30.3. ________personnel from (specify unit) will provide augmentation support
   (determine requirements IAW the AFPAM 10-243 Augmentation Duties program and the
   Personnel chapter of the BSP).
   A17.30.4. _______augmentees (specify officer/enlisted grades) will be in-place no later than
   C+. Local national/civilian overhires will be employed to initiate and continue furnishings
   movement to facilities identified in Part I. SF Forms 52 will be prepared in advance and
   processed to CCPO on C-day for expedient hiring.
   A17.30.5. Assignment of quarters. Personnel will process through the reception processing
   unit (RPU) (Bldg #). Lodging personnel will be under the direction of the RPU chief during
   this initial phase. Registration cards and linen/bedding accountability records will be
   sufficient to cover the programmed TPFDD flow of personnel. Number of officers and
   airmen will be pre-organized and assignments indicated in accordance with lodging,
   dormitories, and housing facilities planned per Part I. Room keys will be organized for issue
   for each facility (except for tents) per the "emergency capacity" in Part I. Base maps showing
   bed-down facilities (including emergency quarters and tent areas) and transportation routing
   from the RPU will be displayed at the registration point. Personnel will complete a
   registration card prior to key issue. Lodging personnel will mark locator cards with building
   number, room number, and phone number (if applicable), and issue initial linen/bedding.
   Special consideration will be given to aircrew members to maximize crew rest and to
   maintain aircrew integrity. This will be done by housing two crew members per room in
   vacant VOQ or VAQ room (see Part I).
       A17.30.5.1. Officer and enlisted personnel room assignments will be made and keys
       issued at the RPU by lodging office and Civil Engineer dorm management or housing
       representatives. When possible, quarters assignments will be done with consideration of
       unit integrity.

        A17.30.5.2. Lodging of medical personnel should be taken into consideration since
        immediate recall of hospital staffs to support mass casualty influxes from base attack and
        other locations is a real and constant concern. Such lodging should be as close to the
        hospital as is available. Medical personnel should also be housed together to afford
        quicker access and recall. This is not the case for Aero medical Crews, who should be
        housed with other AMC crews for alert access.
        A17.30.5.3. Define lodging facilities requirements. The following outlines how and
        where the base population will be assigned lodging and what documentation is required.
        Assignments will be based on capacities and priorities in Part I. Rooms will contain only
        essential furnishings. Try to specify designated unit/occupant and the date the building
        will be required (by C-day per the TPFDD). Assign incoming personnel to rooms vacated
        by permanent party personnel deployed to other locations or evacuated under NEO, as
        required. Develop a plan for securing personal property left behind by all departing
        personnel and dependents to include designated storage facility and managing unit.
        Relocation of permanent party personnel and their personal possessions to accommodate
        and consolidate incoming personnel should be avoided.

   required.
   A17.38.3. Lodging use one officer to five enlisted and one female to ten male personnel as a
   planning factor when designating lodging facilities. AF policy in the housing of women in
   deployment situations states, "There is only one requirement which must be met in the
   housing for women in deployment situations: privacy in sleeping and bathing/latrine
   facilities. Exclusively separate quarters or bathing and latrine facilities are not essential.
   Bathing and latrine facilities can be scheduled on a time-sharing basis or with appropriate
   occupied/unoccupied signs; temporary makeshift partitions may be used to afford quarter‘s
   privacy. Environmental conditions and/or austere living accommodations cannot be
   considered limiting factors in the use of women in deployment situations. Women can
   function under the same environmental conditions and use the same existing facilities as
   men, including the most adverse and primitive." (Reference USAF WMP Volume I, Annex
   GG). To ensure the incoming number of personnel is current, coordination with base LGX
   should be performed and the date of coordination documented. Incoming officer and enlisted
   personnel will be assigned to designated emergency areas as shown in Part I. Consideration
   should be given to designation of separate areas for officer and enlisted, if feasible. Female
   personnel will be housed in separate facilities (where practical) as shown in Part I.
   A17.38.4. Lodging Vehicles. (Coordinate within BaS&E Chapter 20 of the BSP) Unit
   Services personnel will plan vehicle requirements. Coordinate with unit VCO and the
   Vehicle Management Flight to ensure completeness prior to Vehicle Management
   consolidation of unit requirements for publication of the BSP. Vehicle Management, prior to
   their inclusion in the BSP, must approve all subsequent changes to vehicle authorizations,
   including WRM vehicles.
   A17.38.5. Lodging Communications and Information. Identify any communications and
   information requirements beyond the capabilities already provided. Items for consideration
   include: basic phone services, computers, network capabilities (classified and unclassified),
   secure phone instruments, LMRs and/or pagers, secure and unsecure facsimile machines, and
   printing capabilities. The installation must also have the ability to rapidly notify housed
AFI10-404_USAFESUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                                          101


   personnel of impending or actual force protection threats i.e., fires, bomb threats, imminent
   enemy attack, presence of contamination, etc. Services personnel must verify the adequacy of
   in-place notification systems (with assistance from Emergency Management,
   Communications, fire fighters, etc.) If the INWS is insufficient in personnel housing
   facilities, services personnel will work with Emergency Management and Communications
   personnel to develop work around mitigation measures. Coordinate with installation
   communications officer prior to consolidation of requirements into Base Support Plan.
   Ensure these requirements are addressed in BaS&E Chapter 30.
   A17.38.6. Lodging. In areas where the CBRN threat warrants, services and emergency
   management personnel must jointly develop response procedures for instances where CB
   contamination adversely affects personnel housing facilities. This includes immediate
   response actions by off-shift personnel located in these facilities, relocation priorities and
   procedures/criteria, and techniques for verifying the safety of previously contaminated
   facilities. Describe the concept of operations for these activities. Cross reference this
   information to the material contained in the CBRN BaS&E Chapter 11. CRITICAL.
   RATIONALE: This vital area must be addressed as it is one of the largest unrealistic
   ―simulations‖ associated with peacetime training and exercises. Non-preparedness for this
   probable event will result in unnecessary mission degradation and personnel
   injuries/fatalities.

   instruments, LMRs and/or pagers, secure and unsecure facsimile machines, and printing
   capabilities. Coordinate with installation Communications Officer prior to consolidation of
   requirements into Base Support Plan. Ensure these requirements are addressed in BaS&E
   Chapter 30.
A22.19. Outline specific responsibilities for the Transportation Combat Readiness and
Resources Flight: (This office serves as the focal point for consolidating OPLAN planning and
all planning issues affecting the utilization of any and all transportation resources. It monitors
readiness posture of transportation flights. In concert with other transportation flight chiefs, it
performs capability analysis to ensure sufficient resources to meet ExPlan/OPLAN and resulting
BSP taskings. It also ensures transportation inputs that impact airlift requests are fully
coordinated and takes action to resolve transportation deficiencies. During deployment
operations, this flight becomes the TCC support staff as situations and personal expertise permit,
and as directed by the transportation function.)
A22.20. Outline specific responsibilities for the Vehicle Operations Control Center (VOCC).
The nerve center of transportation units during deployment/contingency operations. The VOCC
is the transportation "command post" and will be capable of being manned and equipped 24
hours a day. This work center is the command and control for all transportation resources for the
duration of the contingency, and consequently, is the only emergency work center that does not
phase out prior to cessation of the contingency. All transportation work centers will keep the
TCC advised of their status and of all problems and assistance required. The TCC will be the
initial source of contact for all support requests not covered in the BSP and for BSP support
which is not being met. Outline TCC concept of operations and provide essential details of
operation.
A22.21. Outline specific responsibility for Traffic Management Office (TMO). As the
movement expert in all available modes and having detailed knowledge of processing
requirements, the TMO is an essential player in base support planning. TMO must be able to
investigate alternate modes of moving peacetime, exercise, and contingency requirements
whether through other services, common user land transportation, host nation, or commercial
sources and determine relative reliability and any legal formalities required. Direct support of
sortie production is the first priority of USAF transportation resources. All other movements are
allocated to available movement resources IAW mission priority. This is a basic shipping and
planning function which must be incorporated into base support planning and expanded in
AFI10-404_USAFESUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                                           131


contingency operations. The increased availability of automated systems for the rapid processing
and movement of cargo has improved the overall efficiency of this process. These systems can
be deployed to allow automation in the field as well as home base.
A22.22. Outline specific responsibility for Vehicle Management Flight. Vehicle Management is
the wing‘s single manager for Air Force registered vehicles, and Vehicle Operations is the sole
source of organic movement capability where no unit functional vehicle capability exists. Units
possessing vehicle authorizations are expected to perform movements with in-house capability.
Excess vehicle operations capability beyond that tasked in the BSP may be requested from TMO,
who will levy lift requirements to both vehicle operations and other available carriers
commensurate with established criteria. It is therefore important that vehicle operations identify
recurring on-base support services such as base taxi or shuttle bus operations, or state that such
services are not available.
   A22.22.1. As the OPR for organic capability and filling the wartime vehicle authorizations
   for units requiring in-house capability, Vehicle Management and Analysis Element staff
   authorization requests for both peacetime and wartime use and assign assets IAW the Master
   Vehicle Report (MVR). During contingency operations, vehicle management recalls
   peacetime use vehicles and reassigns them to wartime authorizations IAW the MVR. Vehicle
   operations ensures the availability of road kits for war readiness vehicles which will be
   prepositioned to off-base locations. It maintains a fleet of vehicles and trained operators to
   meet preplanned taskings and such requirements as may be requested by TMO. Additionally,
   vehicle management maintains necessary supply of straps, tie down devices, and other
   vehicle support supplies as needed to meet the wartime requirements of the transportation
   squadron.
   A22.22.2. Vehicle operations takes action IAW appropriate directives to secure approval for
   WRM vehicle release and responds to command directives for vehicle shipments to any area.
   It advises TCC of vehicle losses for subsequent command action, and keeps the TCC/TMO
   appraised of organic movement capability and mission impact as a result of insufficient
   vehicle assets. The chief of transportation, through the Vehicle Management and Analysis
   Element, will advise contracting of vehicle requirements and quantities. As the wing single
   manager for registered vehicles, only those assets reflected in the BaS&E Chapter 20 are
   considered true vehicle requirements. Vehicle requirements will not be reflected in any other
   BSP chapter. If a reference to a vehicle is deemed essential, a statement to refer to the
   BaS&E Chapter 20 will suffice.
   A22.22.3. Based on a comprehensive review of contingency recurring support requirements,
   vehicle management and analysis element establishes consolidated operations (such as
   combining administration/fleet management to release manpower for other duties) wherever
   possible. It ensures detailed expedient hardening, dispersal, and contamination avoidance
   ―coverage‖ plans are in effect for the protection of assets, administers the vehicle priority
   recall plan when directed, and establishes a viable vehicle recovery program.
   A22.22.4. Ensure vehicle fuel requirements are coordinated with base fuels. Consider the
   use of alternative fueled vehicles.
A22.23. Outline specific responsibility for Vehicle Management and Analysis Element. (During
contingency operations and periods of heavy workload, vehicle management has the capability
of tailoring their workload by waiving non-safety related repairs and maintenance. However,
 132                                             AFI10-404_USAFESUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


these waivered repairs will have to be accomplished in time, and therefore any waivers due to
workload must be held to a minimum. Consequently, vehicle management must determine the
level of maintenance necessary to support the base on a day-to-day basis, as well as what waivers
are justified during periods of heavy workload, such as exercises and contingencies. Shop and
supervisory personnel must be aware of the residual hazards associated with vehicles that have
been previously contaminated with chemical agents and will be tracked IAW AFMAN 10-2602,
Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, And Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards.
Vehicle fleet managers will need to explore expansion of fully or partially equipped mobile
maintenance capability and the possibility of satellite maintenance sites especially in remote
areas of the base or in proximity to flightline operations.)
   A22.23.1. Establish procedures to release vehicles from maintenance shops which when
   released will not violate safety conditions or cause further mechanical deterioration.
   A22.23.2. Describe maintenance support for off-base activities, such as communication
   sites.
   A22.23.3. Describe mobile maintenance requirements.
   A22.23.4. Identify vehicle management priorities, including war reserve vehicles.
   A22.23.5. A communications network must be established placing maintenance control in
   touch with mobile maintenance, remote locations, and the TCC (when activated). A system
   of reporting all critical vehicle management repair actions must be on line between
   maintenance, the TCC, and vehicle operations.
   A22.23.6. Determine whether the installation has the maintenance capability, to include
   acceptance of the responsibility, to designate priority maintenance to Level 2 and 3 vehicles.
A22.24. List all factors taken into consideration during the formulation of support plans from
plan execution.
A22.25. Describe all shortfalls.
A22.26. Miscellaneous Notes. Include the following information in the miscellaneous notes
section.
   A22.26.1. Functional Assumptions. List all factors taken into consideration during
   formulation of support plans for OPLAN execution. Use the same format as in Part I, but
   focus on assumptions critical to operation in a wartime environment.
   A22.26.2. LIMFACS. After comparing base capabilities against OPLAN requirements,
   identify any limiting factors and submit to the plans and integration function for review by
   the BSPC. If approved, BSP LIMFACs will be documented in the LIMFACs chapter of the
   BSP and forwarded to MAJCOM HQ and the NAF.
   A22.26.3. Attention needs to be given to potential interruption of supply pipelines and the
   known recurring parts failures that could reduce vehicle availability. Mission kits must be
   fabricated for those vehicles to be prepositioned at bare base support locations. Increased
   emphasis in operator care is also warranted under contingency conditions.

   locations for AME aircraft loading with engines running offload (ERO), together with
   primary and secondary locations for AMC mobile AME staging facilities.
   A23.10.3. Aircraft that can be handled in 24 hours during peacetime operations or
   Operations other than war (OOTW) should be annotated for both uncontaminated and CB
   contaminated environments. Cargo support aircraft that can be handled in a 24 hour period
   will vary due to types programmed to transit the base and the purpose of the mission.
   Estimate the base's capabilities under different aircraft configurations using standard
   planning factors for cargo or passenger allowable cabin load (ACL) and ground times based
   on calculations. NOTE: Throughput capacity is the maximum number of aircraft that can be
   on the ground and serviced simultaneously in any one 24-hour period. Factors will vary with
   turnaround requirements, such as refueling, crew rest, and others. Other factors affecting
   throughput capacity are load scales, hot cargo pad, net explosive weight (NEW) limitations,
   high line docks, and container handling. Major command transportation staffs should provide
   necessary guidance.

   if appropriate, International Standardization Organization (ISO) container handling
   equipment, and highlights or jetways for CRAF aircraft used in AME. Staff should also
   identify availability of lights or light carts for night operations, and supplies and source of
   supplies for aerial port operations including dunnage for static load distribution.
   A23.10.5. List any additional information appropriate for this function and not covered
   elsewhere.
A23.11. Multimedia Files. Include any applicable multimedia information: photographs, maps,
diagrams, drawings, word documents, power point, excel spread sheet etc.
PART II:
A23.12. Provide a general overview of aerial port requirements during plan execution. (Identify
specific responsibilities for unit and non-unit cargo and personnel and their relationships with the
deployment and reception control centers, if different than what is identified in Part I.)
A23.13. Describe all shortfalls.
A23.14. Miscellaneous Notes. Include the following information in the miscellaneous notes
section.
   A23.14.1. This Chapter will be written in consultation with HQ AMC/A4X. The Part 2
   chapter will be broken into four distinct or ―main‖ parts.
       A23.14.1.1. The four parts will include: AEF e.g. CRG/AEG, strategic airlift aircraft and
       strategic air refueling aircraft maintenance, aerial port operations, and
       overages/shortfalls/LIMFACs. The Part II chapters will reflect the entire spectrum of
       functional area support and will outline all of AMC‘s requirements for sustained
       operations. This format is applicable for strategic airlift aircraft aerial ports of
       debarkation (APODs) and for locations where the bed-down of TRANSCOM-
       owned/AMC ―air bridge‖ aircraft or personnel occur [read: non-chopped or non-theater
136                                              AFI10-404_USAFESUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


      augmentation aircraft]. In these instances, the chapter inputs will not be broken up into
      functional areas by the host plans and integration functions.
      A23.14.1.2. However, where AMC strategic air refueling aircraft or tactical airlift
      aircraft ―chop‖ to the theater in an augmentation role (supporting fighter/bomber
      employment and theater logistics missions), the format will follow host plans and
      integration function‘s guidelines and may be broken into functional chapters.
  A23.14.2. Identify the following assigned and required MHE from the applicable TPFDD as
  planned by HQ AMC. Total requirements for air transportation personnel/equipment/vehicles
  will not vary from TPFDD requirements without prior coordination with HQ AMC before
  publication. TPFDD requirements may not consider all equipment available for use at the
  base because requirements could be filled by incoming assets while base assets may be
  tasked to forward deploy because of operational necessity/timing.
  A23.14.3. Additionally, a passenger terminal facility, air freight warehouse, covered storage
  areas, hot cargo pads, and pallet grid yard will be identified. Aircraft parking positions (cargo
  and support aircraft parking positions will vary due to types programmed to transit the base)
  will be identified.
  A23.14.4. At a minimum, address parking capabilities for C-5, C-9, C-12, C-20, C-21, or
  other operational support aircraft (OSA) as necessary, C-17, C-27, C-130, KC-135/KC-10 as
  warranted, and CRAF aircraft. These parking capabilities should be reflected for each type of
  aircraft assuming no other cargo or support aircraft are concurrently on the ground (i.e. "the
  base is capable of supporting ______C-130s, if no other cargo or support aircraft are on the
  ground at the same time").
  A23.14.5. Communications and Information: Identify any communications and information
  requirements beyond the capabilities already provided. Items for consideration include: basic
  phone services, computers, network capabilities (classified and unclassified), secure phone
  instruments, LMRs and/or pagers, secure and unsecure facsimile machines, and printing
  capabilities. Coordinate with installation Communications Officer prior to consolidation of
  requirements into Base Support Plan. Ensure these requirements are addressed in BaS&E
  Chapter 30.
  A23.14.6. If the threat warrants, describe cargo movement operations in CBRN
  environments. As a minimum, include the following:
      A23.14.6.1. Likely operating environments.
      A23.14.6.2. Decision trees for aircraft movement after a chemical attack.
      A23.14.6.3. Cargo contamination avoidance and control procedures.
      A23.14.6.4. Contaminated airfield cargo movement operations.
         A23.14.6.4.1. Establish a Contaminated Cargo Holding Area.
         A23.14.6.4.2. Integration of mission criticality and hazard category.
      A23.14.6.5. Offload operations (Transload if appropriate).
         A23.14.6.5.1. Clean to dirty.
         A23.14.6.5.2. Dirty to clean.
AFI10-404_USAFESUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                                    137


  A23.14.7. The overages/shortfalls/LIMFACs section will address those areas of either
  surplus or critical need for AMC as calculated against total base resources and all other
  known common-user or unique theater requirements on those scarce base resources.

                 WAR READINESS MATERIEL (WRM) (BAS&E CH 22)

PART I: IS NOT DEVELOPED FOR THIS CHAPTER
A24.1. In Part I identify WRM UTCs by capability that is being stored at the base. This includes
WRM UTCs that are being stored for another location and will be outloaded for a
contingency/wartime operation.
A24.2. The WRM UTCs identified in this part are used by the deploying unit for tailoring
purposes. Deploying units will tailor mobility packages to reduce airlift requirements and allow
faster closure times.
PART II:
A24.3. In Part II identify WRM UTCs allocated to the base as in-place and counted as a
capability for that base.
A24.4. Movement requirements and schedule for assets: identify all vehicle and material
handling equipment (required and available packing material such as pallets, nets, dunnage, and
tiedown devices to ship by preplanned modes).
A24.5. Describe procedures for requesting air, sea, and ground transportation. Identify all
manpower requirements needed for such tasks as outload documentation and preparation;
tiedown, blocking, and bracing; and onloading and offloading at railheads.
A24.6. Identify units to which assets will be issued, to the extent possible.
A24.7. Dispersal plan for all assigned WRM assets and WRM that arrives from other storage
locations. Develop expedient hardening, dispersal, and contamination avoidance ―coverage‖
plans for all assigned WRM assets and WRM that arrives from other storage locations. Identify
priority of assets to be dispersed. Identify all manpower and materiel required for dispersal.
A24.8. Describe procedures to ensure necessary parts, modifications, and shelf-life items are
available and distributed with assets.
A24.9. Describe all shortfalls.
A24.10. Miscellaneous Notes. Include the following information in the miscellaneous notes
section.
   A24.10.1. WRM planning identified in the BSP is not a restatement of AFI 25-101, War
   Readiness Materiel (WRM) Program Guidance And Procedures responsibilities and
   requirements. Rather, it identifies local requirements and procedures necessary to ensure in-
   place and incoming WRM can support the operations.
   A24.10.2. During BSP site surveys, using units will identify Base Operating Support (BOS)
   requirements (i.e., vehicles) to the host base and include it in the BSP Part II. The
   NAF/MAJCOM along with the WRM GM will determine what portion of these requirements
   can be sourced by WRM UTCs. Upon completion of this process the requirements will be
   included in the WRM UTA and the Global Strategy Document (GSD) for the specific
   theater. The UTCs are then postured accordingly by the MAJCOM Functional Manager (FM)
AFI10-404_USAFESUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                                                             139

                          the WRM requirements determination process see (AFI 25-101).
                          A24.10.3. Provide the information for major items, commodities, or UTCs to be moved on
                          or off-base as indicated in Tab 1.
                          A24.10.4. Provide the information for major items, commodities, or UTCs to be received as
                          indicated in Tab 2.
                          A24.10.5. After comparing capabilities against WRM global strategy requirements, identify
                          any limiting factors and submit them to the plans and integration office for review by the
                          BSPC.

maintenance function prepares this chapter, with inputs and assistance from squadrons and
agencies with aircraft maintenance responsibilities. Part I of this chapter outlines the general
maintenance capabilities of the installation which currently exist and are separated into three
separate sections; on-equipment (flight line) maintenance, off-equipment (backshop/intermediate
maintenance), and maintenance operations. These capabilities may not be available to all
incoming units; incoming units must coordinate with the installation to ensure that a capability
they may wish to use is deploying, not dedicated to another unit, or otherwise unavailable. Part II
covers OPLAN specific actions/procedures and will also be addressed in the same three
subsections.

                                         Attachment 27
                                MUNITIONS (BAS&E CH 25)

Note: In coordination with the Maintenance Group Commander, munitions units will develop
munitions employment plans (MEP) using the following guidance. The plan must be in direct
support of taskings outlined in applicable OPLANS, CONPLANS, and the BSP.

Note: For CONPLAN taskings, as there are infrequent specific munitions build or load-out
details, planning will encompass those actions required to deploy, and general actions that
remain the same for any scenario. Plan requirements should not be additive i.e. assume that
contingencies and OPLAN execution will not occur simultaneously.

Note: For OPLAN taskings, munitions plan development will be a coordinated effort between
the reception/bed-down unit (provisional wing) and major deploying units. Units fighting in
place and lead munitions flights deploying to collocated operating bases (COBs) should address
all the areas listed below. Units deploying to main operating bases (MOBs) or units that are not
the lead unit at COBs do not need to address all areas below. They would use the MEP from the
lead unit in developing their plan.

Note: Chapter development starts with performing a thorough and comprehensive initial site
survey. Munitions matters should be addressed by a munitions expert or someone knowledgeable
and experienced in the munitions field. Surveys are not just a one-time effort. Annual visits to
the bed-down location are a necessity, especially if newly assigned personnel are involved. For
added integrity, insist that a knowledgeable munitions NCO/Officer accompany the survey team.
It is essential for the munitions BSP OPR to coordinate with applicable base agencies to ensure
required support will be available, and that this support is cross referenced in the respective
portions of the BSP/ESP. If a site survey is not possible due to the sensitivity of location, the
Contingency Reference Book and Ground Logistics Study contain valuable data for writing the
MEP. These documents are available at wing intelligence (IN) offices, worldwide.

Note: Part I of the chapter should detail the resources available to support contingency taskings.
These resources include in-place assets (to include serviceable WRM) and resources provided
through TPFDD, host nation, and/or other services. Part II describes concept of operations to
meet required taskings and appraisal of the unit's ability to fulfill those taskings. Format of the
chapter will be at local discretion, but should emphasize ease of use and clarity. The guidelines
listed below should give the planner ideas for the areas to consider when developing the chapter.
Only include applicable areas of concern in the plan. However, consider specific needs of
deploying units when addressing areas of concern.

A27.40. Miscellaneous Notes. Include the following information in the miscellaneous notes
section.
   A27.40.1. Munitions Requirements. Total munitions requirements must be known before
   sound planning can take place. The War Consumable Distribution Objective (WCDO),
   Annex D, Appendix 6 of OPLANs, and the unit pre-ITO, and Combat Ammunition System
   (CAS) reports contain information on consumable requirements. These documents outline
   munitions that are to be prepositioned, assembled into a combat configuration, or shipped, as
   well as received, at designated times , and provide estimated daily consumption charts.
   Coordination with OG and MXG plans functions is essential in this area.
       A27.40.1.1. Munitions operations will identify all munitions programmed by OPLAN
       tasking for shipment or receipt to the Base WRM and Transportation Officers. The
       munitions operations function will assist the Chief of Logistics Plans in preparing
       appendices for WRM munitions out-loading and receiving for munitions identified by
       OPLAN for shipment or receipt.
       A27.40.1.2. Units will assure munitions shipping/receiving capability in the event
       communications are out (comm-out). Should the appropriate cell within the Global
       Ammunition Control Point (GACP) be unreachable, shipping units will confirm outload
       requirements with their C-NAF in the first instance, and MAJCOM secondly. If a
       "comm-out" situation exists with all headquarters, the shipping/receiving units will take
       the initiative to establish communications and confirm out-load capability prior to
       execution of the shipment. All modes of communication will be considered in a "comm-
       out" situation, to include such means as DSN, commercial telecon or telegram, MARS,
       SSB radio, USN radio links, and physical relays by courier.
       A27.40.1.3. In a "comm-out" condition to all headquarters, shipping units will process
       munitions as specified in the most current TPFDD or as requested by the receiving unit
       once communications are reestablished.
       A27.40.1.4. Units storing War Reserve Supplies for Allies (WRSA) items will take into
       consideration the amount of WRSA munitions to be moved when assessing the unit‘s
       capability to ship and receive assets. WRSA movements are to be included in any
       concept of operation for munitions movements.
   A27.40.2. Transportation. Note transportation requirements, sources, distribution, and
   maintenance and control procedures not covered elsewhere. Compute additional vehicle
   requirements considering on-hand vehicle fleet, as well as any WRM vehicles assigned to
   your unit. Provide requirements to Vehicle Management by vehicle type, number currently
   authorized for peacetime operation, number currently assigned, and number required to
   support OPLAN requirements. Coordinate with Vehicle Management to ensure completeness
   before the consolidation of wing requirements in the BaS&E Chapter 20 of the BSP. All
   subsequent changes of vehicle authorizations, including WRM vehicles, must have Vehicle
   Management approval prior to inclusion in the BSP. Munitions vehicle requirements are
   included in the BaS&E Chapter 20 of the BSP. Identify procedures for repair of high use
   equipment such as forklifts and tow vehicles.
   A27.40.3. Maps, photographs, drawings, etc., should be maintained as support data. These
   maps should identify locations of the MSA, storage structures, convoy routes, aircraft
AFI10-404_USAFESUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                                        161


  parking ramp, and other important areas for the planner to develop an effective plan. If maps
  or photographs don‘t exist or are unavailable, make drawings to add support for the
  requirement.
  A27.40.4. LIMFACs/Shortfalls. Consolidate all shortfalls and LIMFACs in this section and
  outline efforts to resolve them. Number and assign each LIMFAC an office of primary
  responsibility (OPR), point of contact (POC), estimated completion date (ECD), impact
  assessment and work around. After identifying LIMFACs on AF form 4006, submit them to
  plans and integration function for review by the BSPC. All LIMFACs should be treated as
  classified to the level of the originating document.
  A27.40.5. Any additional information not covered elsewhere in the munitions chapter.

PART I:
A46.1. Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) grid maps will be established for all agencies
on the installation. Depict base areas and facilities that will be used to support the base
contingency mission and show all requirements for facilities and utilities. Generally describe the
base layout and its location relative to known geographic landmarks, for example, "XXXX Air
Base is approximately 5 miles southwest of city, (country). The base is serviced by major
highway route and is _____miles from the nearest railway."
A46.2. Consolidate maps required by various functional activities. Include a general base layout
and annotate the following areas or facilities (lodging, dining, medical, maintenance, supply,
munitions, utilities, fuels storage and servicing, morgue and mass burial area, etc.). Identify
CBRN area monitoring locations on-base grid maps and/or 1:A46,000 scale maps.
A46.3. These layouts will also portray the areas for emergency use when existing facilities are
saturated. Depicted should be such areas as emergency troop housing areas, aerial port and
related areas, deploying vehicle parking, aircraft parking, field kitchens, field hospital in relation
to existing facilities, tent city location, and other pertinent areas.
A46.4. Utility layouts should reflect possible expansion of USAF and host nation lines. The use
of layouts and depiction of major functional building is encouraged. Generally, maps should
show the layout of functions to address the base missions in the base support plan. The maps
should vary in scale so as to depict the overall layout and specific areas.
A46.5. On-base maps will be available using 1‖=400‘ and 1‖=800‘ scale for crash
recovery/response and airfield maps will be available for damage plotting/minimum operating
strip selection in the 1‖ = 100‘ scale.
A46.6. Maps should be documented by Civil Engineering representatives using standardized
AutoCAD compatible software. Maps should be produced on a standard 30 inch by 42 inch
construction drawing. Suggest using an engineering scale of 1 inch equals 400 feet. All map
requests and changes should be coordinated thru the CE Emergency Management office to
ensure all maps have been standardized.
A46.7. Multimedia Files. Include any applicable maps
