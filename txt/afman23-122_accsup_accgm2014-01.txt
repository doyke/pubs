     ACC Guidance to Air Force Manual 23-122, Materiel Management Procedures

2.5.1.6.6.1. (Added) CTC will write the After Action Report and forward to QA for
subsequent routing.
4.3.3.2.1.1. (Added) DIFM status/location codes will reflect the status/location of the asset due
in from maintenance, not the issued asset.
4.3.3.2.1.2. (Added) AXC. FSC will track aircraft location independently of the activity
using this code and will notify using activity if aircraft returns and status is not updated.
Location TDY, DEP or other locally developed code will be used to indicate parts are off
base.
4.3.3.2.1.3. (Added) AWF may be used only for parts being held by AMUs that are awaiting
testing to determine serviceability. FSC will track estimated test completion date for this
status.
4.3.3.2.1.4. (Added) AWM, CTE, FWP, INW, MTM, RPR, and Blank are not authorized. If
status is changed to FWP or Blank by program control it will be changed immediately.
4.3.3.2.1.5. (Added) IID, INO, INR, and IRD status codes will be determined by LRS Materiel
Management. FSC will track estimated arrival date and document TCN.
4.3.3.2.1.6. (Added) INV. DIFM assets whose location can’t be “eyes on” validated within 24
hours are deemed missing and will be identified by status INV. The DIFM detail will
immediately be frozen for special inventory and DIFM inventory count will be conducted IAW
AFMAN 23-122, Paragraph 5.7.6.3. FSC will ensure status is loaded prior to detail being
frozen for special inventory and will validate and track report of survey (if applicable) by
documenting the number until resolved.
4.3.3.2.1.7. (Added) OAM. OAM status will be used until asset is removed from weapon
system or end item. Parts are due in from maintenance the moment they are backordered
provided the asset does not limit or restrict the operational capability of the weapon system or
end item. Parts that can’t be removed until the new part is received will be tracked when OAM
status exceeds 3 days from date issued.
4.3.3.2.1.8. (Added) TCG. The FSC will track scheduled maintenance dates for all parts in
TCG status and will notify applicable activity when backorder and issue times are non-
compliant with AFI 21-101.
4.3.3.2.1.9. (Added) TIN. Assets coded TIN with a status indicator other than CRT will
be reconciled daily by FSC to ensure assets are processed.
4.3.3.2.1.10. (Added) TOC. FSC will validate all NSNs in TOC status against the T.O. and
will document the T.O. number.
4.3.3.2.1.11. (Added) ZCP. FSC will contact AFREP representative on all assets non-
compliant with AFI 21-123 CAF Sup, Paragraph 3.6.13.
4.3.3.2.1.12. (Added) Z(NN) are authorized for use only by repair shops and will be used for
parts not coded (AWP). Z(NN) codes may only be applied for items not identified as direct
NRTS and are not authorized to accumulate status days beyond 60 days. If more time is needed

                                      Agile Combat Power
a new Z date will be loaded prior to the 60 day mark. The first digit of this code is "Z" to
reflect, "in-shop" for repair. The second and third digits of the code are the last two numbers of
the Julian date the repair section expects to return the item to a serviceable condition. For
example: DIFM status code "Z89" read on 23 March tells the user the item is in the repair
section and is expected to be made serviceable on 30 March. Another example: DIFM status on
30 March is FWP so the flight updates the status to "Z99" to indicate a 9 April ETIC.
4.3.3.2.1.13. (Added) Parts with location FSC will not have a status other than (TIN, RFS,
MDR, and INV) and will be reconciled daily to ensure assets are processed and accounted for.
4.3.3.2.1.14. (Added) Standard DIFM status codes listed in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Table
4.1, are not authorized for use as location codes (i.e. TCG, TOC, AXC, etc.) and will be
changed immediately.
4.3.3.2.1.15. (Added) FSC will contact repair activity for any Direct NRTS items with a
repair shop location and validate direct NRTS coding, status, and location. Updates will be
made immediately.
4.3.3.2.1.16. (Added) Only repair activities are authorized to use status codes that count as
repair cycle days with exception of AWF, IID, INO, INR, and IRD.
5.3.2.4.3.5. (Updated) Warehouse Locations for Unserviceable Details. All unserviceable
details must have an assigned warehouse location. Warehouse location load/change/delete
inputs may be used to load or change locations on unserviceable details. All location
loads/changes will be maintained in suspense until the location is verified by its appearance on
the Due-In From Maintenance Listing.
5.3.3.4.1.1. (Updated) Only personnel authorized by the Commander or equivalent are
permitted to handle and accept controlled materiel into accountable records systems. Releasing
activities will verify the identification of an individual and their authorization to accept
controlled materiel prior to signing for the materiel. Note: Controlled materiel in this paragraph
refers to Classified and NWRM materiel only.
5.3.3.4.1.2. (Updated) Utilize only the most current authorization list(s) of individuals
approved to handle, and accept controlled materiel. Maintain the source lists in a single
collection point to manage the documents. Update these lists on an annual basis or when
changes occur. Note: Controlled materiel in this paragraph refers to Classified and NWRM
materiel only.
5.4.1.3.2.1. (Added) Group and wing commanders will be provided one consolidated
annual report comprised of all reports of accounts visited.

the last 24 inventories accomplished (total of 2 years). Due to space constraints of
Custodian Jacket File, listings may be centrally filed elsewhere.
5.4.18.4.4.2.6. (Added) All 1ETX transactions terminating accountability will be briefed to the
LRS CC/AO during the monthly M10 review. A Discoverer script or ESS inquiry listing of all
1ETX transactions will supplement the M10 as an attachment and filed accordingly.
5.5.1.2.4. (Deleted) Duplicate paragraph.

                                     Agile Combat Power
5.5.3.4.1.1. (Added) Document Control will manually annotate the proper delinquent date
calculated IAW AFI 23-101 paragraph 5.5.7.9 on the listing and notify sections when not
computed correctly by the system.
5.5.4.6.1. (Added) Cover letter may be signed and filed with M10.
5.5.7.7.6.1. (Added) Prior to freezing the item record, warehouse refusal procedures will
be followed IAW paragraph 5.3.8.4.1.
5.7.1.3.6. (Added) When inventorying serialized controlled assets and not using a CA/CRL, a
Discoverer script or ESS inquiry listing all detail serial numbers associated with the
applicable inventory will be attached to the listing being used (i.e. D23, R43, Q13, R12 etc.).
During inventories, personnel will perform a 100% physical inventory count by serial
number. Specifically, physically verify the serial number on the item to the serial number on
inventory list.
5.7.3.3.10.3.2. (Updated) Obtain the required inventory count list (MRSP listing/CA-CRL)
using the inventory count option (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6). Send the MRSP
custodian the inventory count list. Note: ILS-S queries will not be used as the official tool
to perform this function. MRSP listing will be supplemented with a Discoverer script or
ESS inquiry listing all COMSEC 250 detail serial numbers associated with MRSP being
inventoried.
5.7.8.2.2.4. (Added) Inventories for SA/LW on details other than CA/CRL/SPRAM
accounts will be inventoried semi-annually in March and September using applicable listing
(i.e. R43, D23, R12, etc.)
5.7.8.3.3. (Updated) EAE will maintain one annual copy of the signed inventory CA/CRL
in the Master Jacket File. The original signed CA/CRL along with all other inventories
accomplished throughout the year will be filed in Document Control IAW AFI 23-122,
paragraph 5.5.4.6.
6.2.1.1. (Added) Assets without disposition instructions will also be returned and
immediately processed.
6.2.2.5.2.1. (Added) FOB turn-ins are not authorized for items requiring a ROS commensurate
with inventory gains IAW AFMAN 23-220, DoD 7000.14-R, and AFI 20-110, Special
Inventory procedures will be followed. If ownership cannot be determined, LRS/CC or AO will
assume ownership, conduct ROS (if applicable) and adjust items onto supply accountable
records.
6.2.5.4.2.1.3.1. (Added) EAE will make a third copy of AF Form 2005 and annotate
“SUSPENSE COPY” and forward to Document Control for creation of DSD, IAW para
5.5.3.4.3. If disposition instructions are not obtained within 24 hours, EAE will forward
remaining copies to Documented Cargo Operations for item pick up and subsequent return.
8.2.8.6. (Added) Storing activities will produce a controlled item code listing monthly of all
stored items for review to ensure proper storage segregation of controlled materiel.
10.2.2.2. (Updated) Supply activities will not issue controlled materiel to individuals not
