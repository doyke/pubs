                                     MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. (T-2).
     2.1.1. The responsibility for mission planning is shared jointly by all flight members and the
     operations and intelligence functions of fighter organizations.
2.2. General Procedures. (T-2).
     2.2.1. Accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission accomplishment to
     include fuel requirements, map preparation, and takeoff/landing data.
        2.2.1.1. [PACAF] Fly planned over water flights outside the local training area (i. e.,
        deployments, cross countries, PDM inputs, etc.) as a two-ship minimum. OG/CC may
        approve single-ship missions.
        2.2.1.2. [USAFE] In addition, when applicable, pilots will consult the following for
        mission planning:
            2.2.1.2.1. DOD FLIP Planning Europe, Africa, and Middle East.

     airborne training opportunities.
2.3. Map/Chart Preparation. (T-2).
     2.3.1. Local Area Maps. A local area map is not required if the unit pilot aid includes
     jettison areas, divert information, controlled bailout areas, and provides a local area map of
     sufficient detail to remain within assigned training areas.
        2.3.1.1. [USAFE] On flights from a deployed location, each aircrew will have available
        a local map annotated with designated flying areas, emergency airfields, buffer zones,
        control zones, and restricted or danger areas if this information is not available in the
        aircrew aid.
     2.3.2. Charts. Flight Information Publications (FLIP) enroute charts may be used instead of
     maps on navigational flights within areas that are adequately covered by these charts.
AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  9


       2.3.2.1. [USAFE] Pilots may use UK Enroute Low Charts to supplement US DoD
       Enroute Low charts as deemed necessary. Aircrew will reference UK Flight
       Information Handbook for index and chart definitions contained on UK Enroute Low
       chart.
   2.3.3. Low Altitude Maps.
       2.3.3.1. Reference AFMAN 11-217V2, Visual Flight Procedures, chapter 3, for Low
       Altitude Map requirements and procedures.
       2.3.3.2. For all flights conducted in the low-level structure (i.e. below 1,000 feet AGL or
       as defined by host nation), each aircraft in the flight will contain a minimum of one Chart
       Handbook Manual (CHUM) updated map of the low altitude route or training areas. The
       map will be of a scale and quality that terrain features, hazards, and chart annotations are
       of sufficient detail to allow navigation and safe mission accomplishment.
       2.3.3.3. Highlight all manmade obstacles at or above the planned flight altitude.
       2.3.3.4. IAW AFMAN 11-217V2, Chapter 3, annotate all maps with both an Emergency
       Route Abort Altitude (ERAA) for the overall route/area and Minimum Safe Altitudes
       (MSA) for each leg of the intended route of flight.
          2.3.3.4.1. Compute the ERAA (a.k.a. Emergency Safe Altitude [ESA]) IAW
          AFMAN 11-217V2, Chapter 3.
          2.3.3.4.2. Compute the MSA at a minimum of 1,000 feet above the highest
          obstacle/terrain (rounded up to the next 100 feet) within 5NM of the planned course
          to include the aircraft turn radius.
       2.3.3.5. [CONUS Only] Aircrew members flying under VFR or inside MTRs will
       supplement existing mission planning materials (e.g., CHUM, FLIP AP/1B, etc.) IAW
       AFI 11-202V3, ACCSUP, Chapter 2, mission planning requirements.
       2.3.3.6. Low level charts and route books used during flight will be annotated with
       location and dimensions of class B/C/D airspace, civil/military airfields and other
       potential high density traffic areas (e.g., parachute activity areas and ultralight/hang
       glider/glider sites, etc.). Within 5 NM of any planned VFR route or MTR lateral
       boundary. Applicable airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity of class B/C/D
       airspace will be annotated and briefed on all such flights. In addition, annotate and brief
       the intersection of other VR/IR routes (if applicable) and any other possible areas of
       conflict.
       2.3.3.7. Use of sectional aeronautical charts in flight is not required.
       2.3.3.8. Aircrew members flying outside CONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM, theater
       or host nation guidance on mission planning. If no gaining MAJCOM, theater or host
       nation guidance exists, use the best charts or Falcon View overlay options available to
       accomplish the requirements of paragraph 2.3.3.6
2.4. Briefing/Debriefing. (T-2).
   2.4.1. Briefings. Flight leaders are responsible for presenting a logical briefing that will
   promote safe, effective mission accomplishment. In addition to items required by AFI 11-
   202V3, all briefings will include the following:
10                                                  AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


     2.4.1.1. All pilots/crewmembers/passengers must attend the flight briefing unless
     previously coordinated with unit supervisors. Anyone not attending the flight brief must
     receive a briefing on mission events and emergency procedures.
     2.4.1.2. Ensure brief start time provides adequate time to discuss required items and
     accounts for mission complexity. As a minimum, begin briefs at least 1.5 hours before
     scheduled takeoff. Alert briefs will start in sufficient time to be completed prior to
     aircrew changeover.
     2.4.1.3. Structure flight briefing to accommodate the capabilities of each flight member.
     2.4.1.4. Briefers will reference applicable portions of briefing guides. Items listed may
     be briefed in any sequence. Those items published in Air Force Instructions (AFI), Air
     Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures manuals (AFTTP) or unit standards and
     understood by all participants may be briefed as “standard.” Specific items not pertinent
     to the mission do not need to be covered.
     2.4.1.5. Takeoff and landing data (TOLD) will be annotated on mission data cards. The
     minimum TOLD required is maximum abort speed (dry/wet), takeoff distance and speed,
     single engine takeoff speed (SETOS), and normal/heavy weight landing distance
     (dry/wet).
     2.4.1.6. Review takeoff data, and ensure every member of the flight understands it. Place
     particular emphasis on takeoff and abort factors during abnormal situations such as
     short/wet runway, heavy gross weights, non-standard cable configurations, and abort
     sequence in formation flights.
     2.4.1.7. Ensure contracts, roles, and responsibilities of each flight member are
     established, briefed, and debriefed.
     2.4.1.8. Include mission priorities, significant rules (e.g., Rules of Engagement [ROE],
     Special Instructions [SPINS], Training Rules [TRs]), task management, weather,
     NOTAMs, and Emergency Procedures (EPs).
     2.4.1.9. Ensure a formation deconfliction, blind, and get well plan for every phase of
     flight is briefed and every flight member understands the plan (see para 3.10). All flight
     members are responsible for executing this plan.
     2.4.1.10. When dissimilar aircraft are flown in formation, brief flight responsibilities,
     proper formation position (to ensure adequate wingtip clearance), and aircraft-unique
     requirements for each phase of flight.
     2.4.1.11. For missions using Night Vision Goggles (NVG), emphasize proper tuning,
     use, and limitations. See para 3.21 for additional procedures.
     2.4.1.12. For all low-level mission briefings, place emphasis on obstacle/ground
     avoidance, altitude-warning features (low altitude warning tone) low altitude comfort
     level, and complacency avoidance.
     2.4.1.13. Brief an appropriate alternate mission for each flight. The alternate mission
     must be less complex than the primary unless Wings have developed and published
     standard alternate mission profiles. The one exception to this rule is that Air Combat
     Maneuvers (ACM) may be briefed as an alternate mission from a Basic Fighter
AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                 11


      Maneuvers (BFM) surge brief. Brief specific mission elements that differ from the
      primary mission or published profiles. Mission elements or events may be modified and
      briefed airborne as long as flight safety is not compromised. Flight leads will ensure all
      flight members acknowledge changes. Do not fly unbriefed missions or events.
      2.4.1.14. All missions will be debriefed.
   2.4.2. Deployed Operations, Exercise, and Quick Turn Briefings. If all flight members
   attend an initial or mass flight briefing, the flight lead on subsequent flights need brief only
   those items that have changed from the previous flight(s).
      2.4.2.1. [PACAF, USAFE] On multiple-go days when aircraft turn times do not allow
      follow-on mission brief(s) and only the initial flight brief is accomplished for all goes,
      the following guidance applies:
          2.4.2.1.1. [PACAF, USAFE] Upgrade missions will be planned for the first sortie
          flown. Subsequent missions will be of equal or less complexity with no upgrade
          training planned without OG/CC approval.
          2.4.2.1.2. [PACAF, USAFE] Participants in continuation training missions may
          fly their primary or alternate missions in any sequence.
   2.4.3. Briefing Guides. Mission briefing guides are contained in the Attachments. Units
   may augment these guides as necessary. Pending development by a higher headquarters,
   units that fly missions not covered by this instruction or its supplements will develop briefing
   guides for those missions and submit them to MAJCOM/A3TO for review.
2.5. Unit Developed Checklists and Local Pilot Aids. (T-2).
   2.5.1. Unit developed checklists may be used in lieu of flight manual checklists provided
   they contain, as a minimum, all items (verbatim and in order) listed in the applicable
   checklist.
   2.5.2. Units will produce a pilot aid that, as a minimum, includes:
      2.5.2.1. Briefing Guides.
      2.5.2.2. Local radio channelization and airfield diagrams.
      2.5.2.3. Emergency information (impoundment procedures, emergency action checklists,
      no radio [NORDO] procedures, divert information, Search and Rescue procedures, and
      On-Scene Commander [OSC] checklist).
      2.5.2.4. Arresting gear information for divert bases.
      2.5.2.5. Bailout and Jettison Areas.
      2.5.2.6. Cross-country procedures to include: command                and   control,   engine
      documentation, JOAP samples, and aircraft servicing.
      2.5.2.7. Other information as deemed necessary by the units. For example: stereo flight
      plans, turnaround procedures, local training areas, instrument preflight, and alert
      procedures.
2.6. Stowing Equipment in Bay 5. (T-2).
 12                                                     AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


   2.6.1. Stow containers or baggage with hard sides inside a Bay 5 cargo container. Without a
   cargo container, stow only locally manufactured fabric intake covers and soft-sided personal
   equipment baggage, such as hang-up or A-3 bags, in Bay 5. Items stowed in Bay 5 will be:
       2.6.1.1. Positioned 1 foot aft of the top of the canopy thruster “catcher’s mitt.”
       2.6.1.2. Forward of the trailing edge of the aft circuit breaker panel on the right wall of
       Bay 5 (do not interfere with internal countermeasures set cables).
       2.6.1.3. Below the top of the circuit breaker panels on the right wall of Bay 5.
       2.6.1.4. Secured with non-stretchable cord in such a manner to prevent movement in all
       three axes of motion. Place aircraft safety equipment and egress pins in locally
       manufactured fabric bags and stow in panels 154L, 35, 47L and R or in the cockpit map
       case. The pilot is responsible for ensuring items stowed in Bay 5 are loaded correctly and
       properly secured. The carriage restrictions for the Bay 5 cargo container are identical to
       the MXU-648/A cargo pod except for the airspeed restriction, which does not apply. This
       guidance does not preclude the pilot from taking any action necessary for safety of flight.
       Pilots will comply with the following restrictions:
          2.6.1.4.1. Aircraft with items stowed in Bay 5, with or without a cargo container, are
          restricted from performing aerobatics.
          2.6.1.4.2. Training missions in aircraft with items stowed in Bay 5, with or without a
          cargo container, are restricted to LIMITED maneuvering training rules. At no time
          during the flight will the pilot execute zero or negative Gravitational Load Factor (G)
          maneuvers unless safety of flight dictates.
2.7. G-suit Use. (T-2).
   2.7.1. IAW AFI 11-301, Volume 1, ACC Supplement, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE)
   Program, the following apply:
       2.7.1.1. G-suit is required during all flights when 2 or more Gs are anticipated.
AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                              13


                                          Chapter 3

                         NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Ground Communications. (T-2).
   3.1.1. The pilot will accomplish the ground crew briefing (when required) in accordance
   with the briefing guide contained in this instruction.
   3.1.2. Prior to starting the JFS in a B/D model with the Rear Cockpit (RCP) occupied, the
   pilot will get an “OK” signal from the rear cockpit occupant.
   3.1.3. Normally, the pilot and ground crew will communicate using the intercom during all
   engine start and pre-taxi checks. Use the intercom system, to the maximum extent possible,
   anytime aircraft engines are operating and maintenance technicians are performing tasks on
   the aircraft. Units with active air defense commitments may waive the use of intercom during
   alert scrambles.
       3.1.3.1. During the After Engine Start flight control checks, confirm the proper
       movement and position of the flight control surfaces with the crew chief.
3.2. Ground Visual Signals. (T-2).
   3.2.1. When ground intercom is not used, use visual signals IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft
   Operations and Movement on the Ground, and this instruction. All signals pertaining to
   operation of aircraft systems will originate with the pilot. The crew chief will repeat the
   given signals when it is safe to operate the system. The pilot should not activate any system
   that could pose danger to the ground crew prior to receiving proper acknowledgment from
   ground personnel. The following signals augment AFI 11-218.
       3.2.1.1. JFS START. With clenched fist, pilot makes a pulling motion.
       3.2.1.2. FLIGHT CONTROLS CHECK. Raise arm, clench fist, and make a stirring
       motion.
       3.2.1.3. BRAKE CHECK. Hold left or right arm horizontal, open hand and push
       forward, breaking at the wrist (as in applying rudder pedal pressure with feet).
       3.2.1.4. DEEC Check. With the fingers and thumb of each hand extended and joined at
       the tips, open and close the fingers and thumbs of both hands simultaneously, simulating
       nozzle opening and closing.
       3.2.1.5. LOSS OF BRAKES WHILE TAXIING. Lower tailhook.
       3.2.1.6. GUN ARMAMENT CHECK. Point index finger forward with thumb upward
       simulating a pistol and shake head (yes or no).
3.3. Preflight. (T-2).
   3.3.1. Do not carry baggage/equipment in an unoccupied F-15B/D rear cockpit (Exception:
   forms/maps may be stowed in the map case).
   3.3.2. In lieu of HHQ guidance (e.g. theater special instructions), set the emergency locator
   beacon to AUTO while on local training missions and ferry flights.
 14                                                    AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


3.4. Ground Operations. (T-2).
   3.4.1. IAW AFTTP 3-3.F15, the minimum taxi interval is 150 feet staggered or 300 feet in
   trail. Spacing may be reduced when holding short of or entering the runway.
   3.4.2. Do not taxi during snow and/or icy conditions until the taxi route and runway have
   been checked for safe conditions. In this case, taxi on the centerline with a minimum of 300
   feet spacing.
       3.4.2.1. [USAFE] Minimum runway condition reading (RCR) on taxiways for taxi
       operations is RCR 10.
   3.4.3. Maximum taxi speed during sharp turns is 10 knots. Above 10 knots the aircraft may
   skid and/or depart the three-point attitude.
   3.4.4. Quick Check and Arming. Keep hands in view of ground personnel during quick
   check, arming or dearming operations. If the intercom system is not used during end of
   runway (EOR) checks, the pilot will establish and maintain visual contact with the ground
   personnel to allow the use of visual signals.
   3.4.5. Do not taxi in front of aircraft being armed/de-armed with forward firing ordnance.
3.5. Flight Lineup. (T-2).
   3.5.1. Flights will line up as appropriate based on weather conditions, runway conditions,
   and runway width. Use a minimum of 500 feet spacing between separated elements/flights.
   For formation takeoffs, wingmen must maintain wingtip clearance with their element leader.
   If runway width precludes line-up with wingtip clearance between all aircraft in the flight,
   use 500 feet spacing between elements or delay run-up until the preceding aircraft/element
   releases brakes.
3.6. Before Takeoff Checks. (T-2).
   3.6.1. Just prior to takeoff, all flight members will inspect each other for proper
   configuration and any abnormalities. Wingmen will indicate they are ready for takeoff by a
   head nod, radio call, or landing/taxi light signal.
3.7. Takeoff. (T-2).
   3.7.1. Per MAJCOM guidance, OG/CC may waive RCR minimum for specified units
   operating in cold weather locations, but in no case will takeoffs be conducted with an RCR of
   less than 8.
       3.7.1.1. [ACC/ANG] Do not takeoff if the RCR is less than 12.
   3.7.2. On training missions, do not takeoff if the computed takeoff roll exceeds 80 percent of
   the available runway. For single ship takeoffs, if the single ship computed military power
   takeoff distance exceeds one-half of the available runway, takeoff using afterburner.
   3.7.3. When operating from airfields equipped with a compatible, remotely operated cable,
   ensure the departure end cable is raised for all takeoffs and landings, unless another departure
   end cable is in place.
AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                               15


   3.7.4. Use a minimum of 10 seconds (15 seconds when using afterburners) takeoff interval
   between aircraft/elements. When joining “on top” use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff
   interval.
   3.7.5. Wing/Group Commander or Ops Group Commander (Supervisor of flying [SOF] for
   ANG) may approve intersection takeoffs if operational requirements dictate.
3.8. Formation Takeoff. (T-2).
   3.8.1. Formation takeoffs are restricted to elements of two aircraft.
   3.8.2. A qualified flight leader must lead a formation takeoff unless an Instructor Pilot (IP)
   or flight lead qualified squadron supervisor is in the element.
   3.8.3. Aircraft must be within 3,000 pounds weight of each other and symmetrically loaded.
   Consider symmetrically loaded as those store loadings that do not require an abnormal trim
   or control application to counter a roll or yaw during takeoff and acceleration to climb
   airspeed.
   3.8.4. In accordance with AFTTP 3-3.F15, for rolling formation takeoffs, the wingman must
   be properly aligned on the runway prior to the flight lead advancing the throttle for takeoff.
       3.8.4.1. [PACAF, USAFE] Rolling formation takeoffs are not authorized.
   3.8.5. Do not make formation takeoffs when:
       3.8.5.1. The runway width is less than 125 feet.
       3.8.5.2. There is standing water, ice, slush, or snow on the runway.
       3.8.5.3. The crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots.
       3.8.5.4. Loaded with live munitions (excluding air-to-air missiles, 20mm ammunition,
       and chaff/flares).
       3.8.5.5. Ferrying aircraft from a contractor or AFMC facilities.
       3.8.5.6. The computed takeoff roll exceeds 50% of the available runway.
3.9. Join-up/Rejoin. (T-2).
   3.9.1. Day weather criteria for a visual flight rules (VFR) join-up underneath: ceiling 1,500
   feet and visibility 3 miles.
   3.9.2. Reference AFTTP 3-3.F15 for formation rejoin standard contracts (airspeeds, bank
   angle, and formation position).
   3.9.3. Battle Damage Checks. When circumstances permit, flight leads will direct a battle
   damage check after each mission prior to or during return to base (RTB). Except at
   night/Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC), this check is mandatory following the
   expenditure of any ordnance (including all types of 20mm ammunition). Fly no closer than
   fingertip formation spacing. Ensure deconfliction in accordance with AFTTP 3-3.F15.
   3.9.4. For further join-up procedures, reference AFTTP 3-3.F15 and see Night Joinup
   paragraph 3.20.3 and Chapter 4.
   3.9.5. Air-to-Air Interrogator (AAI), Identification Friend or Foe/Selective Identification
   Feature (IFF/SIF) Operation.
 16                                                     AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


      3.9.5.1. Military use of AAI Mode 4 interferes with ATC and civil Mode 3/C codes. F-
      15 AAI use in the National Airspace System (NAS) will comply with the following:
      3.9.5.2. To reduce the potential for adverse effects on Combat Identification, ATC, and
      Traffic Collision Avoidance systems, aircrew will limit interrogations to the minimum
      required for the mission.
      3.9.5.3. For AAI operation within the United States and its Possessions (US&P), aircrew
      will comply with the equipment and operational restrictions as specified in the applicable
      Radio Frequency Authorization(s) which can be obtained from the unit spectrum
      management office.
      3.9.5.4. OCONUS, follow gaining MAJCOM, Theater, or Host Nation guidance for AAI
      operation.
3.10. Formation, General. (T-2).
   3.10.1. In IMC, the maximum flight size in close/route formation is four aircraft except
   when flying in close formation with a tanker.
   3.10.2. Do not use rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain formation position below 5,000
   feet Above Ground Level (AGL) or in airspace where aerobatics are prohibited.
   3.10.3. Airborne visual signals will be in accordance with AFI 11-205, Aircraft Cockpit and
   Formation Flight Signals. For four-ship flights, formation changes will be initiated by radio
   call, when practical. When formation position changes are directed by radio, all wingmen
   will acknowledge prior to initiating the change. A radio call is mandatory when directing
   position changes at night or under instrument conditions.
   3.10.4. Flight leaders will not break up formations until each wingman has a positive fix
   from which to navigate (visual, radar, Embedded Global Positioning System/Inertial
   Navigation System [EGI], or Tactical Air Navigation [TACAN]).
   3.10.5. Changing Leads.
      3.10.5.1. When flying in limited visibility conditions, initiate lead changes from a
      stabilized, wings level attitude.
      3.10.5.2. The minimum altitude for a lead change is 500 feet AGL over land or 1,000
      feet AGL over water (for night see paragraph 3.20.4.2, for IMC see paragraph 4.6.1)
      3.10.5.3. Do not initiate lead changes with the wingman further aft than 30 degrees from
      line abreast.
      3.10.5.4. Flight/element leads will not initiate a lead change unless the aircraft assuming
      the lead is in visual contact and in a safe position to do so.
          3.10.5.4.1. When flying an instrument approach in IMC, do not initiate lead changes
          inside the final approach fix (FAF).
      3.10.5.5. Initiate a lead change by visual signal or radio call.
      3.10.5.6. Acknowledge receipt of the lead by head nod or radio call, as appropriate.
      3.10.5.7. A lead change is effective upon acknowledgment.
      3.10.5.8. The former leader then moves to the appropriate wing position.
AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                 17


   3.10.6. The flight lead is always responsible for flight actions, regardless of the physical
   position in which he flies. Wingmen should always be prepared to fly the number one
   position if, in the judgment of the flight lead, such action is warranted.
   3.10.7. Pilots who are not flight leads may lead limited portions of missions provided an
   instructor pilot (IP) or squadron supervisor is in the same element.
   3.10.8. Dissimilar Formations. Dissimilar aircraft may be flown in the same formation if
   mission requirements dictate or to expedite traffic flow during departures and recoveries.
   Specific procedures will be thoroughly prebriefed.
3.11. Tactical Formation. (T-2).
   3.11.1. General. In addition to guidance in AFTTP 3-3.F15, apply the following rules for
   flight path deconfliction during tactical maneuvering:
      3.11.1.1. Flight/element leads will consider wingman/element position and ability to
      safely perform a maneuver before directing it.
      3.11.1.2. Wingmen/elements must maneuver relative to the flight lead/lead element and
      maintain sight. Trailing aircraft/elements are responsible for deconflicting with lead
      aircraft/elements.
      3.11.1.3. Wingmen/elements will normally cross above the lead/lead element when
      deconfliction is required.
   3.11.2. Loss of Visual. Use the following procedures when one or more flight
   members/elements lose visual contact within the formation:
      3.11.2.1. When any flight member/element calls “Blind,” then the appropriate flight
      member/element will immediately respond with “Visual” and a position report or
      “Blind.”
      3.11.2.2. When the other flight member/element is also “Blind,” that pilot will transmit
      his altitude as an immediate action to deconflict flight paths. The flight lead will ensure a
      minimum of 500 feet altitude separation is maintained. Avoid climbs/descents through
      the deconfliction altitude when possible.
      3.11.2.3. When there is not a timely acknowledgment of the original “Blind” call, then
      the flight member/element initiating the call will maneuver away from the last known
      position of the other flight member/element and alter altitude.
      3.11.2.4. If visual contact is still not regained, the flight leader will take additional
      positive action to ensure flight path deconfliction within the flight to include a
      Terminate/Knock-It-Off call if necessary. Consider scenario restrictions such as
      sanctuary altitudes and/or adversary blocks.
      3.11.2.5. Aircraft will maintain altitude separation until a visual is regained and, if
      necessary, will navigate with altitude separation until mutual support is regained.
      3.11.2.6. During certain tactical formations (Tactical, Fighter Data Link [FDL] Tactical,
      Night Tactical, weather intercepts, wedge, etc.) visual may be lost due to environmental
      conditions, terrain, or desired tactics. Always ensure two sources of deconfliction are
 18                                                  AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


      maintained until visual is re-established (A/A TACAN, FDL, sanctuary altitudes,
      geographic deconfliction, Radar Situational Awareness [SA], AAI, etc.).
   3.11.3. Two-Ship. Deconfliction during tactical maneuvering of two-ship formations is in
   accordance with AFTTP 3-3.F15.
   3.11.4. Three/Four-Ship (or greater). When flights of more than two aircraft are in
   tactical formation:
      3.11.4.1. Formation visual signals performed by a flight/element leader pertain only to
      the associated element unless specified otherwise by the flight leader.
      3.11.4.2. Trailing aircraft/element(s) will maintain sufficient spacing so that primary
      emphasis during formation maneuvering/turns is on low altitude awareness and
      deconfliction within elements, not on deconfliction between elements.
3.12. Chase Formation. (T-2).
   3.12.1. Restrictions. Any pilot may fly safety chase for aircraft under emergency or
   impending emergency conditions. In addition:
      3.12.1.1. Qualified pilots (including Initial Qualification Training [IQT]/Mission
      Qualification Training [MQT] pilots who have successfully completed an
      Instrument/Qualification evaluation) may chase as safety observer for aircraft performing
      simulated instrument flight or hung ordnance patterns.
      3.12.1.2. Specialized missions (i.e., Operational Test and Evaluation [OT&E], Weapon
      System Evaluation Program [WSEP], live weapons delivery, etc.) and training conducted
      IAW AFI 11-2F-15, Volume 1, F-15 Aircrew Training, may be chased by Combat
      Mission Ready (CMR)/Basic Mission Capable (BMC) pilots designated by
      Group/Squadron Commanders.
      3.12.1.3. All other chase events may only be flown by IP / Stan/Eval Flight Examiners
      (SEFEs) or upgrading IPs under the supervision of an IP.
   3.12.2. Procedures:
      3.12.2.1. A safety observer in a chase aircraft, except IP/SEFE/specialized mission
      chase, will maneuver in a 30-60 degree cone with nose/tail clearance to 1,000 feet, to
      effectively clear and/or provide assistance.
      3.12.2.2. IP/SEFE/specialized mission aircraft will maneuver as necessary, but must
      maintain nose/tail separation until required to transition to close formation when deemed
      necessary by the IP/SEFE.
      3.12.2.3. No chase aircraft will stack lower than the lead aircraft when below 1,000 feet
      AGL.
3.13. Show Formation. (T-2).
   3.13.1. Brief and fly show formations as approved. Refer to AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy
   and Procedures, and applicable MAJCOM directives for specific rules and appropriate
   approval levels to participate in static displays and aerial events.
3.14. Maneuvering Parameters. (T-2).
AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                 19


   3.14.1. Minimum Altitudes. For aerobatics, remain above 5,000 feet AGL. During nose
   high/low speed and Air Handling Characteristics (AHC) vertical maneuvering ensure
   maneuvers are terminated to allow recovery above 5,000 feet AGL.
   3.14.2. Avoid flight through wingtip vortices and jetwash. If it is unavoidable, immediately
   unload the aircraft to approximately 1 G.
   3.14.3. Do not extend flaps to improve aircraft maneuvering performance during Air Combat
   Maneuvering (ACBT).
   3.14.4. Long Term Structural Health Mitigation Measures.
      3.14.4.1. In order to alleviate unnecessary structural fatigue on the F-15 fleet while
      making pilots aware of existing service life issues, units will comply with the following
      restrictions:
          3.14.4.1.1. Limit maneuvering during administrative portions of the flight (to/from
          airspace, patterns, etc.) to less than 5Gs to the maximum extent possible.
          3.14.4.1.2. Minimize high G, heavy weight maneuvering if not necessary to
          accomplish the mission.
          3.14.4.1.3. Minimize unnecessary operation in flight regions most damaging to the F-
          15 structure to include:
              3.14.4.1.3.1. Repetitive occurrences in double rate/solid tone Overload Warning
              System (OWS) beeper.
              3.14.4.1.3.2. Consistent flight transients within the 6-7.5 G region.
      3.14.4.2. Proper tactics and essential proficiency training are paramount to combat
      effectiveness and should not be sacrificed in an attempt to conserve structural health.
3.15. Ops Checks. (T-2).
   3.15.1. Accomplish sufficient ops checks to ensure safe mission accomplishment.
   Additionally, each pilot should monitor the fuel system carefully throughout the flight to
   identify low fuel, trapped fuel, or out of balance situations as soon as possible. Ops checks
   are required:
      3.15.1.1. During climb or at level off after takeoff.
      3.15.1.2. Prior to each (D)ACBT engagement or intercept. In addition, a check for proper
      operation of all transfer tanks (wing tanks balanced and tank 1 feeding) will be performed
      prior to and between engagements or planned maneuvering above 30 units Angle of
      Attack (AOA).
      3.15.1.3. Following Air Refueling.
   3.15.2. Minimum items to check are engine instruments, total and internal fuel
   quantities/balance, G-suit connection, oxygen system, cabin altitude, and G meter/OWS.
   3.15.3. For formation flights, the flight leader may initiate ops checks by radio call or visual
   signal and wingmen will respond appropriately.
      3.15.3.1. The query and response for ops checks will include pointer over counter
      readings (Example: “13.5 over 15.0” Exception: Total fuel only may periodically be used
 20                                                   AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


      during high demand phases of flight). Following external fuel consumption, ensure tank-
      one is feeding correctly and include “Tank-one feeding” in the ops check. Add a
      “balanced” call to the normal Ops Check reply when wing fuel balance checks are
      required and the difference is no greater than 200 lbs. (Example: “8.5 squared and
      balanced”). If wingmen are within 500 lbs. of the flight lead, a “same” call may be used
      at the discretion of the OG/CC.
      3.15.3.2. When more than one external tank is carried, add a “tanks feeding” call to the
      normal Ops Check reply. When flying the two-wing tank configuration, make a “tanks
      dry” call once the external tanks are confirmed dry and prior to transitioning to unlimited
      training rules. Once the “tanks dry” call has been made, no further reference to tanks
      need be made on subsequent Ops Checks.
   3.15.4. G-awareness Exercise. (T-2).
      3.15.4.1. Reference AFI 11-214 and AFTTP 3-3.F15, Chapter 9. A G-awareness exercise
      will be briefed and accomplished on all tactical missions, day or night, with or without
      night vision goggles, anytime you plan or are likely to maneuver above 5 G’s. Pilots must
      have sufficient visual cues to perform this maneuver. Flight members will maintain a
      minimum of 6000 feet separation between aircraft during the execution of all G-
      Awareness exercises. Visual lookout and formation contracts will be the primary means
      for deconfliction. All available onboard systems will be used to aid in maintaining
      separation during execution. If poor weather or night illumination conditions preclude
      safe accomplishment of the G-awareness exercise, flight leads will modify the profile and
      limit maneuvering accordingly. Briefings for night G-awareness maneuvers will
      emphasize wingman deconfliction procedures and maintaining spatial/situational
      awareness throughout the maneuver. In accordance with AFTTP 3-3.F15, both turns will
      be tactical 180’s.
      3.15.4.2. G-awareness maneuvers and all tactical portions of all missions will be taped
      hot mike for review of G straining techniques during the debrief.
      3.15.4.3. [PACAF, USAFE] Do not use G-awareness turns for systems checks or other
      items that detract from the intended purpose.
      3.15.4.4. If an operational requirement exists (as determined by the OG/CC) for an
      indication of individual aircraft stability, after the second G-Awareness turn the pilot
      should accomplish a stability exercise (aircraft with external tanks should accomplish the
      stability exercise prior to unlimited maneuvering). This exercise will begin upon the
      flight lead's call at 350 KIAS and above 10,000 feet AGL (Mil power for clean
      configuration or After Burner [AB] if configured with external tanks). Pilots will execute
      the Stability Exercise IAW AFTTP 3-3.F-15.
3.16. Radio Procedures. (T-2).
   3.16.1. Preface all communications with the complete flight call sign unless excepted below.
   Transmit only that information essential for mission accomplishment or safe flight. Use
   visual signals when practical.
   3.16.2. Make a “Knock-It-Off”(KIO)/”Terminate” radio call to cease tactical maneuvering
   for any reason, particularly when a dangerous situation is developing. Any flight member
AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                   21


   may make this call. A KIO applies to any phase of flight and any type of mission. All
   participants will acknowledge a KIO by repeating the call.
   3.16.3. The flight/mission leader will initiate all radio checks and channel changes.
   3.16.4. Acknowledge radio checks that do not require the transmission of specific data by
   individual flight members in turn (Example: “2, 3, 4”). Acknowledgment indicates the
   appropriate action is complete, in the process of being completed, or the flight member
   understands.
   3.16.5. In addition to the radio procedures outlined in AFI 11-202 Volume 3, Specific
   Mission Guides, and FLIP publications, the following radio transmissions are required:
      3.16.5.1. All flight members will acknowledge understanding the initial Air Traffic
      Control (ATC) clearance. Acknowledge subsequent ATC instructions when directed by
      the flight lead, or anytime during trail departures/recoveries as detailed in paragraph 4.3
      3.16.5.2. Gear Checks. Report gear down IAW AFI 11-202V3 after extending the
      landing gear and prior to the landing threshold. A wingman or chase need not make this
      call during a formation or chased approach.
   3.16.6. Use brevity code and other terminology IAW AFI 11-214, AFTTP 3-1.1, General
   Planning and Employment Considerations and local standards.
3.17. Change of Aircraft Control. (T-2).
   3.17.1. Both pilots of an F-15B/D must know at all times who has control of the aircraft. Use
   the statement “You have the aircraft” to transfer aircraft control. The pilot receiving control
   of the aircraft will acknowledge “I have the aircraft.” Once assuming control of the aircraft,
   maintain control until relinquishing it as stated above.
   3.17.2. Exception: If the intercom fails, the pilot in the front cockpit (if not in control of the
   aircraft) will shake the stick and assume control of the aircraft, radios, and navigational
   equipment unless prebriefed otherwise.
3.18. General Low Altitude Procedures. (T-2).
   3.18.1. Fly low level formation positions/tactics using AFTTP 3-1.F-15 and AFTTP 3-3.F15,
   as guides.
   3.18.2. During briefings, emphasize low altitude flight maneuvering and observation of
   terrain features/obstacles along the route of flight. For low altitude training over
   water/featureless terrain, include specific considerations with emphasis on minimum altitudes
   and spatial disorientation.
   3.18.3. All obstacle avoidance planning will be based on Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) and
   Emergency Route Abort Altitude (ERAA) as defined in paragraph 2.3.3.3
   3.18.4. If unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral separation from known vertical
   obstructions which are a factor to the flight, flight leads will direct a climb no later than
   (NLT) 3 NM prior to the obstacle to ensure vertical separation. The climb must be to an
   altitude at or above briefed ERAA/MSA. Do not descend below this altitude until
   positional/situational awareness dictates it is safe to do so.
22                                                    AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


  3.18.5. At altitudes below 1,000 feet AGL, wingmen will not fly at a lower AGL altitude
  than lead.
  3.18.6. When crossing high or hilly terrain, maintain positive G and do not exceed
  approximately 120 degrees of bank. Maneuvering at less than 1G is limited to upright
  bunting maneuvers.
  3.18.7. The minimum airspeed for low level navigation is 300 KIAS unless operating IAW
  paragraph 5.3.5, low altitude restricted maneuvering target.
  3.18.8. Minimum Altitudes. The unit commander will determine and certify pilots’
  minimum altitude IAW AFI 11-2F-15 Volume 1, as supplemented. Flight members
  participating in approved step-down training programs will comply with the requirements
  and restrictions of that program. The following minimum altitudes apply to low level training
  unless national rules, route restrictions, or a training syllabus specifies higher altitudes:
     3.18.8.1. 500 feet AGL for: Low Altitude Training (LOWAT) Category I qualified
     pilots.
     3.18.8.2. For night or IMC operation: The minimum altitude is 1000 feet above the
     highest obstacle within 5 NM of course unless operating under the conditions of
     paragraph 3.21.3
     3.18.8.3. [ACC/ANG] 53 WG, 57 WG and AATC will fly low level as required for test
     sorties or IAW Weapons School Syllabi.
     3.18.8.4. [ANG/USAFE] ANG/USAFE units participating in 53 WG and AATC tests
     will fly low level as required to meet test objectives.
     3.18.8.5. For over water operation, the minimum altitude is 1000 feet above the surface
     unless in sight of land. If in sight of land, the minimum altitude may be lowered to 500
     feet above the surface.
  3.18.9. During all low altitude operations, the immediate reaction to task saturation, diverted
  attention, knock-it-off, or emergencies is to climb to a prebriefed safe altitude (minimum
  1000 feet AGL).
  3.18.10. Weather minimums for visual low level training are 1,500 feet ceiling and 3 miles
  visibility for any route or area, or as specified in FLIP for Military Training Routes, unit
  regulations, or national rules, whichever is higher.
     3.18.10.1. [USAFE] Weather minimums in countries where minimum low level
     altitude is 1000 feet AGL are: ceiling 2,000 feet or 500 feet above planned flight
     altitude, whichever is higher, and visibility 8KM. Minimums for low altitude intercept
     training in these countries are 2,500 feet AGL and 8 KM visibility.
  3.18.11. Low Level Route/Area Abort Procedures:
     3.18.11.1. Compute and brief a low-level ERAA for all low level operations IAW
     paragraph 2.3.3.4
     3.18.11.2. Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) route/area abort procedures:
         3.18.11.2.1. Maintain safe separation from the terrain and other aircraft.
AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                   23


          3.18.11.2.2. Comply with VFR altitude restrictions and squawk applicable
          Identification Friend or Foe (IFF)/Selective Identification Feature (SIF) modes and
          codes.
          3.18.11.2.3. Maintain VMC at all times. If unable, follow IMC procedures outlined
          below.
          3.18.11.2.4. Attempt contact with controlling agency, if required.
       3.18.11.3. IMC route/area abort procedures:
          3.18.11.3.1. Immediately climb to, or above, the briefed ERAA.
          3.18.11.3.2. Maintain preplanned ground track. Execute appropriate lost wingman
          procedures if necessary.
          3.18.11.3.3. If deviations from normal route/area procedures are required, or if the
          ERAA/MSA is higher than the vertical limits of the route/area, squawk (IFF/SIF)
          emergency.
              3.18.11.3.3.1. [USAFE] Squawk emergency or according to national rules for
              all IMC route aborts.
          3.18.11.3.4. Attempt contact with the appropriate ATC agency for an Instrument
          Flight Rules (IFR) clearance. If required to fly in IMC without an IFR clearance,
          cruise at appropriate VFR altitudes until IFR clearance is received.
              3.18.11.3.4.1. [USAFE] Request IFR traffic separation if VMC cannot be
              maintained.
3.19. Air Refueling. (T-2).
   3.19.1. Pilots undergoing initial or recurrency training in air refueling will not refuel with a
   student boom operator (does not apply to KC-10).
   3.19.2. Pilots will inform boom operator when refueling from particular tanker type (e.g.,
   KC-10, KC-135, KC-46A) for the first time.
3.20. Night Procedures. (T-2).
   3.20.1. Night Ground Operations.
       3.20.1.1. When ground personnel are working under the aircraft, the anti-collision lights
       should be OFF, and the position lights STEADY.
       3.20.1.2. Taxi on the taxiway centerline with a minimum of 300 feet spacing.
       3.20.1.3. Use the taxi light while taxiing unless it might interfere with an aircraft landing
       or taking off. The taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be visually cleared
       without the taxi light.
       3.20.1.4. Both wingtip position lights, both wing root anti-collision lights, and 2 out of 3
       formation lights per side, must be operational for flight (substituting a formation light in
       lieu of a wingtip position light is not permitted).
 24                                                     AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


      3.20.1.5. For formation takeoffs, flight/element leaders will turn anti-collision lights OFF
      and position lights STEADY when reaching the run-up position on the runway. Wingmen
      will maintain the anti-collision light ON and position lights STEADY for takeoffs.
   3.20.2. Night Takeoff. During a night formation takeoff, direct brake release and
   configuration changes on the radio. Following takeoff, each aircraft/element will climb on
   runway heading to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating turns, except where departure
   instructions specifically preclude compliance.
   3.20.3. Night Join-up. Weather criteria for night join-up underneath is a ceiling of 3,000 feet
   and 5 miles visibility. After join-up, turn all the anti-collision lights OFF and position lights
   to STEADY except for the last aircraft in formation, which will keep the anti-collision light
   ON unless otherwise directed by the flight lead.
   3.20.4. Night Formation Procedures.
      3.20.4.1. When in positions other than fingertip, route, or tactical, maintain aircraft
      spacing primarily by instruments, FDL, Radar/AAI, and/or timing. "Use visual
      references as a secondary means of deconfliction. If aircraft spacing cannot be ensured,
      then establish altitude separation (1,000 feet minimum). Crosscheck instruments at all
      times to ensure ground clearance.
      3.20.4.2. Do not change lead or wing formation positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless
      on RADAR downwind. Direct lead and position changes using the radio and from a
      stabilized, wings-level attitude.
      3.20.4.3. Night Fingertip/Route Position. Night references for fingertip and route
      formation positions are specified in AFTTP 3-3.F-15.
   3.20.5. Night Break-up. Prior to a formation break-up at night, the flight leader will transmit
   attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting, which will be acknowledged by wingmen.
   Wingmen will confirm good navigational aids and return aircraft lighting, if reduced, to
   normal.
   3.20.6. Night Landing. Normally land from an instrument straight-in approach. Refer to AFI
   11-202, Volume 3, as supplemented for specific procedures.
      3.20.6.1. Only perform night formation landings when required for safe recovery of the
      aircraft.
3.21. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Procedures. (T-2).
   3.21.1. USAF/MAJCOM guidance (including AFI 11-202 Volume 3 and AFI 11-214)
   outline NVG procedures. AFTTP 3-1.F-15 and AFTTP 3-3.F15 incorporate expanded
   tactical guidance. Additionally:
      3.21.1.1. NVGs will only be worn by qualified flight members or when upgrading with
      NVGs with a qualified NVG instructor in the flight.
      3.21.1.2. Fly with NVGs only in MAJCOM approved NVG compatible lighted cockpits.
      Permanently modified NVG compatible cockpits that have a degraded light source may
      be used for NVG missions at the discretion of the unit commander. All control and
      performance instruments must be illuminated by an NVG-compatible light source to
      provide immediate reference.
AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  25


     3.21.1.3. Flight leads will brief the appropriate time to don/doff goggles for the sortie to
     be flown. Pilots will ensure deconfliction while donning/doffing goggles.
  3.21.2. NVGs must be preflight tested and adjusted for the individual in the unit eyelane
  prior to NVG operations. Do not wear NVGs during takeoff or landing. Do not don NVGs
  until at least 2,000 feet AGL in climbing or level flight. In all cases, remove NVGs prior to
  the final approach fix.
  3.21.3. NVG equipped aircraft may operate below the ERAA/MSA down to a minimum of
  1,000 ft AGL during high-illumination (HI) periods (as defined by AFI 11-214). The flight
  lead or individual pilot is the final authority to assess actual illumination for a particular
  mission element, based on visibility and terrain features/resolution.
  3.21.4. NVGs may be worn for night tanker rejoins, but will be raised to the up/stowed
  position or removed no later than the precontact position.
  3.21.5. Unless required for battle damage checks or aircraft assistance, wingmen wearing
  NVGs will fly no closer than route formation.
  3.21.6. Battle Damage Checks. NVGs will remain on. The aircraft performing the check
  will approach with position lights bright steady/flash or beacons on while the aircraft being
  checked sets external lights to a minimum, preferably off.
  3.21.7. In-flight Emergencies with NVGs. During in-flight emergencies, immediately
  assess whether the NVGs aid or hinder completing emergency procedures. If they are a
  hindrance or the emergency may deteriorate into an ejection situation, remove and stow the
  NVGs.
  3.21.8. Abnormal Procedures.
     3.21.8.1. Lost sight. If you lose sight within a flight, execute appropriate lost wingman
     procedures. Consider highlighting position by increasing exterior lighting level,
     activating the afterburners, or deploying chaff/flares as the situation warrants.
     3.21.8.2. NVG failure. Ensure separation from other aircraft and the ground before
     attempting to remedy the NVG failure.
         3.21.8.2.1. Transition to instruments.
         3.21.8.2.2. Perform lost wingman procedures if appropriate.
         3.21.8.2.3. Route abort/climb above MSA if appropriate.
         3.21.8.2.4. Terminate/KIO as applicable.
         3.21.8.2.5. With other aircraft in the vicinity, direct them to raise their external lights
         to non-NVG visible levels if two sources of deconfliction have not been established.
         3.21.8.2.6. Attempt to regain NVG operation by switching to the opposite battery.
         Once clear of other aircraft and terrain, change the battery. If these steps do not solve
         the problem, stow NVGs and proceed with non-NVG plan.
     3.21.8.3. Inadvertent flight into weather. Encountering poor weather conditions
     during NVG operations may cause loss of SA and aircrew distraction/disorientation.
         3.21.8.3.1. Single ship or separated from flight members:
 26                                                      AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


              3.21.8.3.1.1. Transition to instruments.
              3.21.8.3.1.2. Route abort if LOWAT, otherwise climb/descend to VMC.
              3.21.8.3.1.3. Terminate/KIO as applicable.
          3.21.8.3.2. Formation flight. If entering weather in formation/close proximity to
          other aircraft, perform the first five steps under NVG failure, as appropriate, then
          climb/descend to attempt to regain VMC.
3.22. Fuel Requirements. (T-2).
   3.22.1. Joker Fuel. A pre-briefed fuel quantity needed to terminate an event and proceed
   with the remainder of the mission.
   3.22.2. Bingo Fuel. A pre-briefed fuel quantity that allows the aircraft to return to the base
   of intended landing or alternate, if required, using preplanned recovery parameters and
   arriving with normal recovery fuel as listed below:
   3.22.3. Normal Recovery Fuel. The fuel quantity on initial or at the FAF at the base of
   intended landing or alternate, if required. Fuel quantity will be as established locally or 2,000
   pounds, whichever is higher.
   3.22.4. Declare the following when it becomes apparent that an aircraft may land at the
   intended destination or alternate, if required, with:
      3.22.4.1. Minimum Fuel - 1200 pounds or less.
      3.22.4.2. Emergency Fuel - 800 pounds or less.
3.23. Approaches and Landings. (T-2).
   3.23.1. The desired touchdown point for a VFR approach is 500 feet from the threshold or
   the glideslope interception point for a precision approach. When local procedures or unique
   conditions require landing beyond the normal touchdown point, adjust the touchdown point
   accordingly.
   3.23.2. Minimum pattern and touchdown spacing between landing aircraft is 3,000 feet for
   similar aircraft (e.g., F-15 versus F-15), 6,000 feet for dissimilar aircraft (e.g., F-15 versus F-
   16) or as directed by MAJCOM or the landing base, whichever is higher. Increase spacing to
   6000 feet for similar and 9000 feet for dissimilar when wind conditions increase the
   likelihood of encountering wake turbulence or wake turbulence procedures are in effect.
   3.23.3. Normally, all aircraft will land in the center of the runway and clear to the turnoff
   (cold) side of the runway when speed/conditions permit.
   3.23.4. Landing Restrictions.
      3.23.4.1. When the computed landing roll exceeds 80 percent of the available runway,
      land at an alternate if possible.
      3.23.4.2. Do not land over any raised web barrier (e.g., MA-1A, 61QSII).
      3.23.4.3. During the aerobrake portion of a normal, dry runway landing, leave flaps
      down to provide increased aerodynamic drag and normal nose fall.
AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                             27


      3.23.4.4. When the RCR at the base of intended landing is less than 12, land at an
      alternate if possible. If an alternate is not available, an approach end or midfield
      arrestment is recommended.
3.24. Overhead Traffic Patterns. (T-2).
   3.24.1. Overhead patterns can be made with unexpended practice ordnance and unexpended
   live air-to-air ordnance.
   3.24.2. Initiate the break over the touchdown point or as directed.
   3.24.3. Execute individual breaks in a level 180 degree turn to the downwind leg at
   minimum intervals of 5 seconds (except IP/SEFE chase or when in tactical formation).
   3.24.4. Aircraft must be wings level on final at approximately 300 feet AGL and 1 mile from
   the planned touchdown point.
3.25. Tactical Overhead Traffic Patterns. (T-2).
   3.25.1. Tactical entry to the overhead traffic pattern is permitted when:
      3.25.1.1. The published overhead pattern altitude and airspeed are used.
      3.25.1.2. Specific procedures are developed and coordinated with appropriate air traffic
      control agencies.
      3.25.1.3. No more than four aircraft are in the flight. Aircraft/elements more than 6,000
      feet in trail are considered a separate flight.
      3.25.1.4. Wingmen in tactical formation offset the runway away from the direction of the
      break.
      3.25.1.5. Normal downwind, base turn positions, and spacing are flown.
3.26. Touch-and-Go Landings. (T-2).
   3.26.1. Fly touch-and-go landings IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 3, as supplemented by
   MAJCOM.
   3.26.2. Do not fly touch-and-go landings with live or hung ordnance (except a safed 20mm
   gun) or with fuel remaining in any external tank.
3.27. Low Approaches. (T-2).
   3.27.1. Observe the following minimum altitudes:
   3.27.2. Normal/no flap single ship low approaches - so that touchdown does not occur.
   3.27.3. IP/SEFE flying chase position - 50 feet AGL.
   3.27.4. Formation low approaches and non-IP/SEFE chase - 100 feet AGL.
   3.27.5. Chase aircraft during an emergency - 300 feet AGL unless safety or circumstances
   dictate otherwise.
      3.27.5.1. During go-around, remain 500 feet below VFR overhead traffic pattern altitude
      until crossing the departure end of the runway unless local procedures, missed
      approach/climbout procedures, or controller instructions dictate otherwise.
 28                                                   AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


3.28. Closed Traffic Patterns. (T-2).
   3.28.1. Initiate the pattern at the departure end of the runway unless directed/cleared
   otherwise by local procedures or the controlling agency.
   3.28.2. When in formation, a sequential closed may be flown with ATC concurrence at an
   interval to ensure proper spacing.
   3.28.3. Plan to arrive on downwind at 200-250 KIAS.
3.29. Back Seat Approaches and Landings. (T-2).
   3.29.1. A RCP landing qualified instructor pilot may accomplish back seat landings. An
   upgrading IP may only accomplish back seat landings when a RCP landing qualified IP is in
   the front cockpit.
   3.29.2. During back seat approaches and landings, the front seat pilot will visually clear the
   area, monitor aircraft parameters and configurations, and be prepared to direct a go-around or
   take control of the aircraft (as briefed by the rear cockpit IP) if necessary.
3.30. Formation Approaches and Landings. (T-2).
   3.30.1. General:
       3.30.1.1. Normally accomplish formation landings from a precision approach. If not,
       accomplish the landing from a published instrument approach or a VFR straight-in
       approach using the Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI), if available. In all cases, use
       a rate of descent similar to a normal precision approach.
       3.30.1.2. A qualified flight lead must lead continuation training formation landings
       unless an IP or flight lead qualified squadron supervisor is in the element.
       3.30.1.3. Aircraft must be within 3,000 pounds weight of each other and symmetrically
       loaded as defined in paragraph 3.8.3
       3.30.1.4. Position the wingman on the upwind side if crosswind exceeds 5 knots.
       3.30.1.5. The wingman must maintain a minimum of 10 feet lateral wingtip spacing.
       3.30.1.6. If the wingman overruns the leader after landing, accept the overrun and
       maintain the appropriate side of the runway and aircraft control. Do not attempt to
       reposition behind the leader. The most important consideration is wingtip clearance.
   3.30.2. Formation landings are prohibited:
       3.30.2.1. When the crosswind or gust component exceeds 10 knots.
       3.30.2.2. When the runway is reported wet; or ice, slush, or snow is on the runway.
       3.30.2.3. When runway width is less than 125 feet.
       3.30.2.4. When landing with hung ordnance or unexpended live ordnance (excluding live
       air-to-air missiles, 20mm ammunition, or chaff/flares).
       3.30.2.5. When the weather is less than 500 feet and 1.5 miles or a flight member’s
       weather category, whichever is higher.
3.31. After Shutdown Procedures. (T-2).
AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                             29


   3.31.1. All flight members will accomplish a post flight walk-around. The intent of this
   inspection is to find evidence of birdstrike, lost panels, damaged ordnance, and structural
   damage resulting from over-Gs or other in-flight abnormalities.

                                INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. Approach Category. (T-0).
   4.1.1. The F-15 is Approach Category E. Accomplish missed approach IAW flight manual
   procedures. Missed approach airspeed is 200-250 KIAS.
   4.1.2. Use approach Category D minimums at an emergency/divert airfield where no
   Category E minimums are published. Airfields with Category D minimums may be
   designated as an alternate (divert) airfield. Further, practice instrument approaches may be
   flown using Category D minimums if VMC can be maintained throughout the procedure.
   Under these circumstances, approach Category D minimums may be used provided:
       4.1.2.1. A straight-in approach is flown.
       4.1.2.2. The aircraft is flown at final approach airspeed of 165 KIAS or less.
       4.1.2.3. The aircraft is flown at 255 knots true airspeed (KTAS) or less for the missed
       approach segment of the approach. At high-pressure altitudes and temperatures 255
       KTAS may not be compatible with published missed approach airspeeds and Category D
       approaches should not be flown.
   4.1.3. The F-15’s EGI is approved for enroute Area Navigation (RNAV). Do not fly RNAV
   approaches.
   4.1.4. Due to a variety of host nation and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
   procedures which may differ from standard F-15 procedures, pilots must ensure that the
   airspeeds they plan to fly on instrument approach procedures are compatible with both
   ICAO/Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) and safety of flight requirements.
4.2. Takeoff and Join-up. (T-2).
   4.2.1. The flight leader must get an appropriate ATC clearance (altitude block or trail
   formation) when a flight join-up is not possible due to weather conditions or operational
   requirements. Formation trail departures must comply with instructions for a nonstandard
   formation flight as defined in FLIP.
   4.2.2. If weather is below 1500 feet and 3 miles, each aircraft/element will climb on takeoff
   heading to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating any turns, except when departure instructions
   specifically preclude compliance.
4.3. Trail Procedures. (T-2).
   4.3.1. General.
       4.3.1.1. During trail formations, basic instrument flying is the first priority and must not
       be sacrificed when performing secondary trail tasks. Strictly adhere to the briefed
       airspeeds, power settings, altitudes, headings, and turn points. If task saturation occurs,
       cease attempts to maintain trail, concentrate on flying the instrument departure, and then
       notify the flight lead. The flight lead will then notify air traffic control (ATC).
       4.3.1.2. Flight leaders will request non-standard formation from ATC.

     4.3.1.3. ATC instructions issued to the lead aircraft apply to the entire flight.
     4.3.1.4. Flight leads will brief aircraft/element spacing. Minimum spacing between
     aircraft when in non-standard formation is 9,000 feet and will be maintained using on
     board radar systems.
     4.3.1.5. Each aircraft/element will follow the No Radar Contact procedures until the
     aircraft/element immediately in trail has radar contact and called “tied.”
  4.3.2. No Radar Contact.
     4.3.2.1. The flight leader will call initiating all turns. Subsequent aircraft must delay
     turns to maintain the desired spacing.
     4.3.2.2. Each aircraft/element will maintain 20 seconds or 2-3 mile spacing using all
     available aircraft systems and navigational aids to monitor position.
     4.3.2.3. During climbs and descents, each aircraft/element will call passing each 5,000
     foot altitude increment with altitude and heading (or heading passing) until join-up, level-
     off, or the following aircraft/element calls “tied.”
     4.3.2.4. Each aircraft/element will call initiating any altitude or heading change.
     Acknowledgments are not required; however, it is imperative that preceding
     aircraft/elements monitor the radio transmissions and progress of the succeeding
     aircraft/elements and immediately correct deviations from the planned route.
     4.3.2.5. Each aircraft/element will maintain at least 1,000 feet vertical separation from
     the preceding aircraft/element until establishing radar/visual contact, except in instances
     where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance. Reduce vertical separation
     to 500 feet if necessary to comply with MSA restrictions.
     4.3.2.6. In the event a visual join-up cannot be accomplished on top or at level off, the
     flight leader will request altitude separation for each succeeding aircraft/element to meet
     the requirements of the above paragraph.
  4.3.3. Radar Contact.
     4.3.3.1. Each aircraft/element will call “tied” when radar contact is established with the
     preceding aircraft. Once all aircraft are tied, no further radio calls are required, unless
     radar contact is lost. If ATC directs a question, or guidance to a certain aircraft, that pilot
     may respond directly to ATC. Flight leads will ensure that wingman are aware of any
     unplanned or ATC directed intermediate level off altitudes.
     4.3.3.2. In flights of three or more aircraft, use all available aircraft systems (i.e., radar,
     TACAN, AAI, FDL, etc.) to ensure that trail is maintained on the correct aircraft.
  4.3.4. Trail Departures.
     4.3.4.1. Use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff spacing.
     4.3.4.2. Each aircraft/element will accelerate in MIL/AB power until reaching 350
     KIAS. Climb at 350 KIAS until reaching cruise mach/KTAS, unless otherwise briefed.
     4.3.4.3. Upon reaching 350 KIAS, the flight leader will set 850 FTIT unless otherwise
     briefed.
AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  33


     4.3.4.4. Limit all turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank.
  4.3.5. Enroute Trail. Flight leads must brief airspeeds, power settings, and configurations.
  4.3.6. Trail Recovery.
     4.3.6.1. Trail recovery procedures must be coordinated/approved through the responsible
     ATC facilities and addressed in a local operating procedure or in the unit supplement to
     this volume. Trail recoveries will only be accomplished at home stations/deployed
     locations where procedures have been established and briefed. As a minimum,
     procedures must address each recovery profile, missed approach, climbout, lost contact,
     lost communications and desired/maximum spacing requirements.
         4.3.6.1.1. [PACAF] Trail recoveries greater than a 2 ship are not authorized for
         any arrival at a deployed base other than the pilots’ home station.
     4.3.6.2. Limit trail recovery to a maximum of four aircraft.
     4.3.6.3. Trail recoveries are authorized when weather at the base of intended landing is
     at/above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or approach minimums,
     whichever is higher.
     4.3.6.4. Trail recoveries will not terminate in simultaneous Precision Approach Radar
     (PAR) or Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) approaches. Recoveries to separate
     PAR/ASRs are authorized, flights will split prior to PAR/ASR final.
     4.3.6.5. The flight lead must brief the flight on spacing, configuration, and airspeeds.
     Minimum spacing between aircraft is 9,000 feet in IMC and will be maintained using on-
     board radar.
     4.3.6.6. The flight lead must coordinate the trail recovery with ATC prior to taking
     spacing.
     4.3.6.7. Prior to split-up, the flight lead must ensure that all wingmen have operative
     navigational aids and air-to-air radar.
     4.3.6.8. Formation break-up will be accomplished IAW paragraph 4.4                    Flight
     separation will be IAW local ATC directives.
     4.3.6.9. The formation must squawk as directed by ATC.
     4.3.6.10. ATC instructions to the lead aircraft will be for the entire flight. ATC will
     provide radar flight following for the entire formation.
     4.3.6.11. Limit all turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank.
     4.3.6.12. Once established on a segment of a published approach, each aircraft must
     comply with all published altitudes and restrictions while maintaining in-trail separation.
     4.3.6.13. Unless local procedures establish defined reference points for airspeed/
     configuration changes, the flight lead must direct changes by radio. At flight lead’s call,
     all aircraft must simultaneously comply with the directed change.
     4.3.6.14. All aircraft must report the final approach fix.
     4.3.6.15. If contact is lost with the preceding aircraft, the pilot will transmit “Call Sign
     (C/S) lost contact.” The preceding aircraft will respond with altitude, airspeed and
 34                                                    AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


      heading. Establish altitude deconfliction and coordinate a separate clearance with ATC. If
      contact is lost while established on a segment of a published approach, flight members
      may continue the approach, but must confirm separation via navigation aids. If separation
      cannot be confirmed, execute missed approach or climbout as instructed by ATC.
4.4. Formation Break-up. (T-2).
   4.4.1. If possible, accomplish formation break-up in VMC. If IMC, accomplish the break-up
   in straight and level flight. Prior to a break-up in IMC, the flight leader must transmit
   attitude, airspeed, altitude, and altimeter setting that will be acknowledged by wingmen.
   Wingmen must confirm good navigational aids.
4.5. Formation Penetration. (T-2).
   4.5.1. Restrict formation penetrations in route/close formation to two aircraft when the
   weather at the base of intended landing is less than overhead traffic pattern minimums.
   4.5.2. If a formation landing is intended, position the wingman on the appropriate wing prior
   to weather penetration.
   4.5.3. Formation penetrations using radar trail procedures are authorized when weather at the
   base of intended landing is at/above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or
   approach minimums, whichever is higher.
4.6. Formation Approach. (T-2).
   4.6.1. During IMC formation flights, do not change lead or wing positions below 1,500 feet
   AGL unless on RADAR downwind.
4.7. Simulated Instrument Flight. (T-2).
   4.7.1. Simulated instrument flight requires a qualified safety observer in either cockpit of the
   aircraft or in a chase aircraft. Use all means to clear the area for hazards.
      4.7.1.1. A safety observer in the same aircraft must have an operable intercom.
      4.7.1.2. A chase aircraft is required in order to log simulated instrument flight in an F-
      15A/C. This does not preclude flying approaches in VMC without a chase, however, in
      this case place primary emphasis on the “See and Avoid” concept. Chase aircraft will be
      in a position where they can effectively clear and/or provide assistance. Chased
      instrument approaches may terminate in formation landings.
4.8. Use of the Heads Up Display (HUD). (T-2).
   4.8.1. For the F-15A/B/C/D, use the HUD as an additional instrument reference not as the
   sole instrument reference. Do not use the HUD to recover from an unusual attitude except
   when no other reference is available.
4.9. Use of the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS). (T-2).
   4.9.1. Although JHMCS displays sufficient aircraft flight symbology to provide basic
   situational awareness, it is not intended to be used for primary flight instrumentation. Do not
   use JHMCS to recover from an unusual attitude.

                          AIR-TO-AIR WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

5.1. References. (T-2).
   5.1.1. AFI 11-214 contains air-to-air procedures, to include operations with live ordnance
   applicable to all aircraft. This chapter specifies procedures or restrictions applicable to F-15
   operations.
5.2. Simulated Gun Employment. (T-2).
   5.2.1. Missions may be flown with a loaded gun provided the gun is safe IAW Technical
   Order (T.O.) 1F-15C-34-1-3CL-1 and a trigger check is first performed with the master arm
   switch in arm with Training Mode deselected. Point the aircraft away from other aircraft and
   inhabited areas during the trigger check. Do not perform a trigger check with a hot gun. If an
   aircraft is flown with a hot gun or live missiles, the procedures in AFI 11-214 apply.
5.3. Maneuvering Limitations. (T-2).
   5.3.1. Minimum airspeed during low altitude offensive or defensive maneuvering (LOWAT)
   is 350 KIAS.
   5.3.2. When configured with three external fuel tanks, aircraft will operate under the
   LIMITED maneuvering category as defined in AFI 11-214. When configured with external
   wing tanks and no centerline tank, UNLIMITED maneuvering is allowed once the externals
   are empty (flight manual restrictions still apply). The tank restriction does not apply to aerial
   gunnery tow aircraft. Tow aircraft may fly using any approved (for test and evaluation) or
   certified (operational) configurations.
   5.3.3. Negative-G gun jinks are prohibited.
   5.3.4. When acting as a restricted maneuvering target for low altitude intercepts, the
   minimum airspeed is 220 KIAS or 20 units AOA, whichever produces the higher airspeed.
5.4. Aerial Gunnery Tow Procedures. (T-2).
   5.4.1. AFI 11-214 applies. In addition:
       5.4.1.1. AGTS-36 Target Set Deployment. Deploy the target set over areas clear of
       surface activity, near the range where shooting will occur. The tow will maintain 240 +/-
       10 KIAS and ensure other flight members are clear during deployment. A chase aircraft
       will ensure that the AGTS-36 tow reel turbine doors open for deployment and the visual
       augmenter (VA) deploys properly. Any time the target set becomes unstable or flies
       erratic, the chase aircraft will advise the tow to cut the target loose.
       5.4.1.2. AGTS-36 Target Set Reel-In. The tow will slow to 240 +/- 10 KIAS and
       initiate target set reel-in when shooting is complete. A chase will evaluate target set
       stability and advise the tow of any abnormalities. Recover target sets that have been hit if
       they do not exhibit abnormal flight characteristics. However, if a target set becomes
       unstable or flies erratic during reel-in, it should be cut loose. Initiate reel-in over areas
       clear of surface activity in anticipation of VA release. The chase will ensure the tow reel
36                                                   AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


     turbine doors are closed, the target set locks into place, the VA releases and perform a
     BDA on the tow after reel-in is complete.
     5.4.1.3. TDU-32 A/B Banner Deployment. The Banner departs the airfield fully
     deployed. Enroute to the range, chase aircraft will ensure a stable flying Banner. While in
     straight and level flight, the chase pilot will also pass the direction of “Banner lean” in
     clock position to the tow pilot. This will establish the best turn direction for employment.
     (If Banner is flying at the 10 o’clock position; tow will turn right)
     5.4.1.4. TDU-32 A/B Banner Recovery. The tow will return to the drop zone IAW
     locally approved procedures for Banner release. Tower will clear the tow to the “drop
     zone” and the pilot will release the Banner for recovery by the ground crew.
     5.4.1.5. Abnormal Procedures.
        5.4.1.5.1. VA fails to deploy. Reel the target set back in and do not use for firing.
        5.4.1.5.2. VA fails to release after reel-in. The tow must recover using hung
        ordnance procedures.
        5.4.1.5.3. Erratic or unstable target set. In all cases where target sets exhibit
        unstable or erratic flight characteristics, the target set should be cut loose. Avoid
        trying to reel-in a target set that begins to become unstable/erratic, cut it free with
        whatever length of cable is present at the time it begins to fly abnormally.
        5.4.1.5.4. Target set shot off. Cut the remaining cable off. The cable may jam in the
        tow reel if reel-in is attempted without a target set present.
        5.4.1.5.5. Cutting target sets loose. Use primary and secondary cutters as the
        preferred means to cut target sets loose. If this is unsuccessful, reel out the target set
        until the cable/target set fall off. The next options depend on fuel availability, weather
        and resources. The tow may try to burn the cable off using afterburner and high AOA
        maneuvers. The target set may be drug off in the water. In this case, the chase will fly
        no lower than 1000 feet AGL and the tow no lower than 400 feet AGL. If all other
        means of cutting the target set loose are unsuccessful and the target set may not be
        safely recovered, jettison the AGTS-36 tow reel.
        5.4.1.5.6. Landing with cable remaining (no target set). The tow must recover
        using hung ordnance procedures. Plan the landing to avoid damage to runway
        approach lighting.
        5.4.1.5.7. Controlled Jettison of Banner on Takeoff. If circumstances permit, tow
        aircraft jettisons Banner IAW local jettison procedures.
        5.4.1.5.8. Unable to Release Banner. If possible, gain chase aircraft (shooter
        desired) and proceed to local jettison area and attempt jettison. If Banner still
        remains, recover IAW local procedures or use (Aerial Gunnery Target Set) AGTS
        cable remaining procedures.
        5.4.1.5.9. Erratic/Unrecoverable Banner. Jettison in working area.
        5.4.1.5.10. Banner Shot Off, Cable Remaining. Release cable in working area.
        Shooter rejoins with tow to ensure no cable remains. If cable remains, follow
        procedures in 5.4.1.5.6
AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  37


5.5. NORAD VID Procedures. (T-2).
   5.5.1. Turn the HUD camera/Digital Video Recorder (DVR) on during active air defense
   visual identification passes no later than 1 NM in the target’s stern and leave it on until after
   completing the breakaway maneuver.

                                           Chapter 7

                        ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

7.1. General. (T-2).
   7.1.1. Follow the procedures in this chapter when other than normal circumstances occur.
   These procedures do not supersede flight manual guidance.
      7.1.1.1. Do not accept an aircraft for flight with any problem that could jeopardize safe
      flight.
      7.1.1.2. Do not use a malfunctioning system unless it is required for safe recovery of the
      aircraft. Do not continue in-flight troubleshooting a malfunction after completing flight
      manual emergency procedures and the aircraft may be safely recovered.
      7.1.1.3. Only conduct fuel dumping to reduce aircraft gross weight for safety of flight.
      When circumstances permit, dump above 10,000 feet AGL over unpopulated areas.
      Ensure the dump switch is returned to normal before landing. Make the appropriate entry
      in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
      7.1.1.4. Do not taxi aircraft with malfunctions that effect the nosewheel steering or brake
      system.
      7.1.1.5. For actual or perceived flight control malfunctions, terminate maneuvering and
      take appropriate action. If the flight control problem was due to crew member/passenger
      stick or rudder interference in B/D model aircraft, the pilot will take appropriate action to
      ensure no further flight control interference occurs.
7.2. Ground Aborts. (T-2).
   7.2.1. If a flight member aborts prior to takeoff, the flight leader will normally renumber the
   flight. Flight leaders must advise the appropriate agencies of such changes.
   7.2.2. In the event of an abort, formation flight may only continue if it is led by a qualified
   flight lead. The alternatives are a sympathetic abort or proceeding on a pre-briefed single-
   ship mission.
   7.2.3. Delayed aircraft may join the flight at a briefed rendezvous point or may fly a briefed
   alternate single ship mission. If accomplishing a join-up, cease tactical maneuvering until the
   delayed aircraft is joined and all flight members are ready to continue.
7.3. Takeoff Aborts. (T-2).
   7.3.1. If aborting the takeoff, clear to the appropriate side of the runway as expeditiously as
   possible based on position within the element. If this is not feasible because of possible cable
   engagement, clear straight-ahead. As soon as practical, give callsign and state intentions. Call
   “Cable, Cable, Cable” to indicate a departure-end arrestment. Following aircraft hold their
   position, abort or takeoff as appropriate to maintain adequate clearance.
   7.3.2. IAW T.O. 1F-15A-1, consideration should be given to hot brakes when brakes are
   applied above 100 KIAS. Ground speed, runway length, gross-weight, runway condition,
   heavy braking and outside air temperature are all variable factors which could contribute to
 40                                                   AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


   hot brakes. If hot brakes are suspected; declare a ground emergency, taxi the aircraft to the
   designated hot brake area, and follow hot brake procedures.
   7.3.3. If aborting a takeoff at or above 100 KIAS, lower the tailhook. If aborting below 100
   KIAS, lower the tailhook if there is any doubt about the ability to stop on the runway.
   7.3.4. Following an aborted takeoff, consider having ground maintenance personnel check
   the aircraft for hot brakes prior to attempting a subsequent takeoff in the same aircraft.
7.4. Air Aborts. (T-2).
   7.4.1. If an abort occurs after takeoff, all aircraft will maintain their original numerical
   callsign.
   7.4.2. Escort aborting aircraft with an emergency to the field of intended landing. In other
   cases, the flight leader will determine if an escort is required.
   7.4.3. Abort the mission and land out of a straight-in approach, regardless of apparent
   damage or subsequent normal operation, for any of the following:
       7.4.3.1. Birdstrike/Foreign Object Damage.
       7.4.3.2. Flight control system anomalies. This does not include flight control system
       lights that reset IAW flight manual procedures.
       7.4.3.3. Engine flameout, stagnation or shutdown.
   7.4.4. If an aircraft experiences an over-G, use the following procedures:
       7.4.4.1. Perform a battle damage check after all over-Gs.
       7.4.4.2. Non-OWS equipped aircraft and OWS equipped aircraft whose OWS is not
       operational.
          7.4.4.2.1. Terminate the mission and land as soon as practical from a straight-in
          approach.
       7.4.4.3. Aircraft equipped with an operable OWS system that experiences an over-G.
          7.4.4.3.1. Immediately terminate maneuvering and call up the OWS matrix on the
          VSD to analyze the displayed parameters.
          7.4.4.3.2. If a positive G, level “1” (one) is displayed in any column of the matrix
          except mass items (MIT), perform a battle damage check with emphasis on the
          overall condition of the aircraft. If no abnormalities are noted, the flight lead may
          continue the briefed mission. If a subsequent positive G, level “1” or greater over-G
          occurs, terminate the mission, perform a battle damage check, RTB and fly a straight-
          in approach, except as noted below.
          7.4.4.3.3. If level “1” (positive or negative) or greater is displayed in the MIT
          column, terminate the mission, perform a battle damage check, RTB and fly a
          straight-in approach.
          7.4.4.3.4. If a positive G, level “2” (two) or greater; or a negative G, any level, is
          displayed in any column of the matrix, terminate the mission, perform a battle
          damage check, RTB and fly a straight-in approach.

       7.4.4.4. Document actual over-Gs (positive G, level 1 or greater, or negative G, any
       level) in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document after
       flight.
   7.4.5. In the F-15B/D, the pilot in command is primarily responsible for handling in-flight
   emergencies. The additional aircrew member will provide checklist assistance at the request
   of the pilot in command.
7.5. Engine Malfunctions. (T-2).
   7.5.1. Report all engine anomalies during maintenance debriefing.
7.6. Radio Failure. (T-2).
   7.6.1. General. Individual aircraft experiencing radio failure will comply with procedures
   outlined in FLIP, AFI 11-202 Volume 3, this instruction, and local directives.
   7.6.2. Formation:
       7.6.2.1. Flight members who experience total radio failure while in close or route
       formation will maneuver within close/route parameters to attract the attention of another
       flight member and give the appropriate visual signals. Terminate the mission as soon as
       practical and lead the NORDO aircraft to the base of intended landing or a divert base.
       Perform a formation approach to a drop-off on final unless safety considerations dictate
       otherwise.
       7.6.2.2. If flying other than close/route formation when radio failure occurs, the NORDO
       aircraft should attempt to rejoin to a route position at approximately 500 feet on another
       flight member. The NORDO aircraft is responsible for maintaining clearances from other
       flight members until his presence is acknowledged by a wingrock, signifying clearance to
       join. Once joined, the NORDO aircraft will give the appropriate visual signals. If pre-
       briefed, the NORDO aircraft may proceed to a rendezvous point and hold. If no one has
       rejoined prior to reaching BINGO fuel, the NORDO aircraft should proceed to the base
       of intended landing or a divert base. Aircraft experiencing any difficulty/emergency in
       addition to NORDO will proceed as required by the situation.
   7.6.3. Aerial Gunnery/Air-to-Surface Gunnery/Missile Firing NORDO Procedures:
       7.6.3.1. Aircraft will not fire without two-way radio contact.
       7.6.3.2. Shooting aircraft: safe the armament switches, join on another member of the
       flight or the tow aircraft, IAW paragraph 7.6.2
       7.6.3.3. Aerial gunnery tow aircraft: rocks wings and continue the turn if an attack is in
       progress. The flight leader of the attacking aircraft will “knock off” the attack and join on
       the tow’s wing, remaining clear of the target in the event it is cut. The tow pilot will use
       standard hand signals to indicate his difficulty. The flight leader will signal when the
       target is cleared for cut with a slicing motion across the throat. After the target is away
       and the flight lead determines there is no remaining cable, the tow will RTB with an
       escort following the briefed NORDO recovery procedures. If cable remains, follow local
       procedures.
   7.6.4. NORDO Recovery:
 42                                                    AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


      7.6.4.1. Apply the procedures in AFI 11-205 and FLIP.
      7.6.4.2. If a formation straight-in approach is flown and a go-around becomes necessary,
      the chase will go-around, pass the NORDO aircraft and rock his wings. The NORDO
      aircraft will go-around, if the situation allows. If the NORDO aircraft is in formation as a
      wingman, the leader will initiate a gentle turn into the wingman and begin the go-around.
      7.6.4.3. A NORDO aircraft intending to make an approach-end cable engagement should
      signal the escorting aircraft by extending the tailhook. If the NORDO aircraft is not
      escorted, the pilot should fly a straight-in approach flashing the landing light on final to
      signal the tower.
7.7. Severe Weather Penetration. (T-2).
   7.7.1. Avoid flight through severe weather. If unavoidable, flights should break-up and
   obtain separate clearances prior to severe weather penetration.
7.8. Lost Wingman Procedures. (T-2).
   7.8.1. In any lost wingman situation, immediate separation of aircraft is essential. Upon
   losing sight of the leader or if unable to maintain formation, the wingman will
   simultaneously:
      7.8.1.1. Execute the applicable lost wingman procedures. Refer to para 7.9 for specific
      spatial disorientation (SD) considerations. Smooth application of control inputs is
      imperative to minimize the effects of SD.
          7.8.1.1.1. Transition to primary flight instruments.
          7.8.1.1.2. Inform lead by transmitting “C/S is lost wingman.”
          7.8.1.1.3. After executing a lost wingman procedure, do not attempt rejoining with
          the flight until obtaining permission from the flight lead.
          7.8.1.1.4. When able, obtain a separate clearance.
          7.8.1.1.5. Observe all published terrain clearance limits.
      7.8.1.2. Two- or Three-Ship Flights (three-ship echelon, refer to four-ship
      procedures):
          7.8.1.2.1. Wings-level flight (climbing, descending, or straight and level). Turn
          away using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds, then resume original heading.
          7.8.1.2.2. Turns:
             7.8.1.2.2.1. Outside the Turn. Reverse the direction of turn using 15 degrees of
             bank for 15 seconds. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to
             resuming the turn.
             7.8.1.2.2.2. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail
             separation and direct the flight leader to roll out of the turn. Maintain the original
             turn. The leader may only resume the turn when separation is ensured.
          7.8.1.2.3. Final Approach. Momentarily turn away from lead to ensure clearance
          and execute the published missed approach procedure.
AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  43


          7.8.1.2.4. Missed Approach. Momentarily turn away from lead to ensure clearance
          and continue the published or assigned missed approach procedure. Climb to 500 feet
          above missed approach altitude.
       7.8.1.3. Four-Ship Flights. Number 2 and 3 follow the procedures outlined above.
       Number 4’s initial action assumes that number 3 has also gone lost wingman. In addition
       to paragraph 7.8 number 4 will:
          7.8.1.3.1. Wings-Level Flight (climbing, descending, or straight and level). Turn
          away using 30 degrees of bank for 30 seconds, then resume the original heading.
          7.8.1.3.2. Turns:
              7.8.1.3.2.1. Outside the Turn. Reverse direction of turn using 30 degrees of
              bank for 30 seconds to ensure separation from lead and number 3.
              7.8.1.3.2.2. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail
              separation and increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Direct the leader to roll out.
              The leader will only resume the turn when separation is ensured.
       7.8.1.4. Leader must acknowledge the lost wingman’s radio call and, when appropriate,
       transmit attitude, heading, altitude, airspeed, and other parameters.
       7.8.1.5. If a wingman becomes separated and any aircraft experiences radio failure, the
       aircraft with the operational radio will obtain a separate clearance. The NORDO aircraft
       will turn the IFF/SIF to NORMAL code 7600 while proceeding with previous clearance.
       If an emergency situation arises along with radio failure, turn the IFF/SIF to
       EMERGENCY for the remainder of the flight.
       7.8.1.6. Only practice lost wingman procedures in VMC.
7.9. Spatial Disorientation (SD). (T-2).
   7.9.1. Conditions that prevent a clear visual horizon or increase pilot tasking are conducive
   to SD. To prevent SD, the pilot must increase his instrument crosscheck rate. If SD
   symptoms are encountered:
       7.9.1.1. Single Ship:
          7.9.1.1.1. Concentrate on flying basic instruments with frequent reference to the
          attitude indicator. Use heads-down instruments. If flying dual, consider transferring
          control to the other crewmember.
          7.9.1.1.2. If symptoms persist and conditions permit, fly straight and level flight until
          symptoms abate, usually within 60 seconds. Consider using the autopilot.
          7.9.1.1.3. If necessary, declare an emergency and advise ATC.
          7.9.1.1.4. Note: It is possible for SD to proceed to the point where the aircrew is
          unable to see or interpret the flight instruments. In this situation, aircraft control may
          be impossible. If this occurs, the aircrew should consider ejecting.
       7.9.1.2. Formation Lead:
          7.9.1.2.1. Advise the wingmen that he has SD and comply with procedures in
          paragraph 7.9.1.1
 44                                                       AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


          7.9.1.2.2. Use the wingmen to confirm attitude and provide verbal feedback.
          7.9.1.2.3. If symptoms persist, terminate the mission and recover the flight by the
          simplest and safest means possible.
      7.9.1.3. Formation Wingman:
          7.9.1.3.1. Advise lead of the disorientation.
          7.9.1.3.2. Lead will advise wingman of aircraft attitude, altitude, heading, and
          airspeed.
          7.9.1.3.3. If symptoms persist and conditions permit, lead will establish straight and
          level flight for 30-60 seconds
          7.9.1.3.4. If the above procedures are not effective, lead should consider passing the
          lead to the wingman, provided the leader will be able to maintain situational
          awareness from a chase position. Transfer lead while in straight and level flight. Once
          assuming the lead, maintain straight and level flight for 60 seconds. If necessary,
          terminate the tactical mission and recover by the simplest and safest means possible.
      7.9.1.4. Greater than 2-Ship Formation. Lead should separate the flight into elements
      to more effectively handle a wingman with persistent SD symptoms. Establish straight
      and level flight IAW paragraph 4.4 (Formation Break-up). Plan to keep the element
      with the SD pilot straight and level while the other element separates.
7.10. Armament System Malfunctions. (T-2).
   7.10.1. Inadvertent Release.
      7.10.1.1. Record switch positions at the time of inadvertent release and provide to
      armament and safety personnel. Record the impact point, if known.
      7.10.1.2. Safe the armament switches and do not attempt further release in any mode.
      Treat remaining stores as hung ordnance and follow hung ordnance procedures during
      RTB.
      7.10.1.3. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison them in a suitable area on
      a single pass, if practical.
   7.10.2. Failure to Release/Hung Ordnance. If ordnance fails to release when all
   appropriate switches are set, proceed as follows.
      7.10.2.1. Hung live ordnance or aircraft malfunction that precludes further live weapons
      delivery.
          7.10.2.1.1. Attempt to release store(s) using an alternate delivery mode. (Not
          Applicable [N/A] for Air-to-Air WSEP.) If unsuccessful, attempt to jettison store(s)
          using selective jettison procedures. Lastly, consider attempting to selectively jettison
          the pylon if ordnance is unsecured or security cannot be determined.
          7.10.2.1.2. If ordnance remains on the aircraft, follow the hung ordnance recovery
          procedures in paragraph 7.10.4.
   7.10.3. Hangfire/Misfire:
AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  45


      7.10.3.1. A missile that fires but fails to depart the aircraft is a hangfire. If this occurs,
      the missile should be closely observed and safety checked by a chase pilot.
      7.10.3.2. A missile that fails to fire when all appropriate switches were selected is a
      misfire. If this occurs, safe the Master Arm switch and follow the hung ordnance
      recovery procedures.
   7.10.4. Hung Ordnance/Weapons Malfunction Recovery:
      7.10.4.1. If practical, visually inspect the aircraft for damage.
      7.10.4.2. Declare an emergency for hung live ordnance (not required for hung
      practice/inert ordnance or for live unexpended ordnance).
      7.10.4.3. If available, obtain a chase aircraft (N/A at night) and avoid populated areas
      and trail formations.
      7.10.4.4. Land from a straight-in approach.
   7.10.5. Miscellaneous Procedures:
      7.10.5.1. Pilots will not attempt to expend ordnance using a delivery system with a
      known weapons release malfunction.
      7.10.5.2. When abnormal missile launch or erratic missile flight is noted after launch,
      visually inspect the launching aircraft by another pilot (if possible) to determine if any
      damage has occurred.
7.11. Post Arresting Gear Engagement Procedures. (T-2).
   7.11.1. Do not shut down the engine(s) unless directed by the ground crew, there is a fire, or
   other conditions dictate.
   7.11.2. Raise the tailhook on the ground crew’s signal.
   7.11.3. Do not taxi until directed.
   7.11.4. Comply with local directives.
7.12. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures. (T-2).
   7.12.1. Simulated Emergency Procedure is defined as any procedure that produces an effect
   that closely parallels an actual emergency, such as retarding the throttle to simulate the drag
   equivalent to a flamed out engine.
   7.12.2. Aborted Takeoff Practice. Only practice aborted takeoffs in the flight simulator,
   Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT), or, if the trainer is unavailable, a static aircraft.
   7.12.3. Simulated in-flight loss of both engines is prohibited.
   7.12.4. Practice in-flight engine shutdown is prohibited.
   7.12.5. Emergency Landing Patterns (Refer to AFI 11-202 Volume 3).
      7.12.5.1. Field Requirements. Practice of emergency landing patterns at active airfields
      is authorized provided that crash rescue and air traffic control facilities are available and
      in operation.
 46                                                    AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


      7.12.5.2. Supervisory Requirements. IQT (including Formal Training Unit [FTU])
      pilots require an IP on board the aircraft or in a chase aircraft. MQT (including FTU)
      pilots require a SOF in place and an IP or flight lead monitoring from the traffic pattern.
      7.12.5.3. Pattern Procedures:
          7.12.5.3.1. Include the type of practice emergency pattern in the gear check call.
          7.12.5.3.2. Initiate practice single-engine go-arounds in sufficient time to ensure the
          aircraft does not descend below 300 feet AGL. Simulated single-engine approaches
          may descend below 300 feet AGL provided the approach terminates in a full stop
          landing or the go-around from a low approach or touch and go landing is performed
          with both engines. When conducting such training, the pilot will advise the
          appropriate air traffic controller of his intentions.
7.13. Search and Rescue (SARCAP) Procedures. (T-2).
   7.13.1. If an aircraft crashes, immediately attempt to locate possible survivors and initiate
   rescue efforts. Expect that the aircrews may initially suffer from shock or have delayed
   reactions due to ejection injuries. The following procedures are by no means complete and
   should be adjusted to meet each unique search and rescue situation.
      7.13.1.1. Knock off maneuvering.
      7.13.1.2. Establish a SARCAP commander.
      7.13.1.3. Squawk 7700 to alert ATC/Ground Controlled Intercept (GCI) of the
      emergency situation.
      7.13.1.4. Communicate the emergency situation and aircraft/flight intentions
      immediately to applicable control agencies. Use GUARD frequency if necessary.
      7.13.1.5. Mark the last known position of survivors/crash site using any means available
      (TACAN, EGI, FDL, ATC/GCI position and/or visual references).
      7.13.1.6. Remain above the highest ejection altitude, if known, or the highest observed
      parachute until determining the position of all possible survivors.
      7.13.1.7. Deconflict other aircraft assisting in the SARCAP by altitude to preclude
      midair collision. Establish high/low Combat Air Patrol (CAP) as necessary to facilitate
      communications.
      7.13.1.8. Revise BINGO fuels or recovery bases as required to maintain maximum
      SARCAP coverage. Do not overfly the adjusted BINGO fuel.
      7.13.1.9. Relinquish SARCAP operation to designated rescue forces upon their arrival.
      7.13.1.10. Follow local or briefed procedures.
7.14. Lateral Asymmetry. (T-2).
   7.14.1. When a fuel imbalance develops that exceeds 5000 ft/lbs. of lateral asymmetry,
   terminate maneuvering and investigate. If the imbalance was caused by a slow feeding
   external or internal wing tank, restrict maneuvering to instruments, deployment missions, or
   limited maneuvering intercepts less than 30 units AOA, IAW tech order guidance, until the
   imbalance is corrected. Pilots will use the High AOA Warning Tone as a tool to limit the
AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                 47


   aircraft to less than 30 units. If the imbalance cannot be corrected, terminate the mission. The
   above events can be flown to reduce gross weight.
   7.14.2. Weapon and stores asymmetry must also be included to compute the total asymmetry
   condition.
   7.14.3. Use the following rules of thumb in Table 7.1 to determine if a fuel asymmetry
   condition exceeds the Dash-1 limit of 5000 ft/lbs:

Table 7.1. Asymmetry ROTs.
              Location of Fuel                 To get total ft/pounds:
              Internal Wing Fuel               8 X imbalance = (ft/pounds)
              External Wing Fuel               10 X imbalance = (ft/pounds)

                           LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

8.1. This chapter is reserved for unit local operating procedures. (T-2).
   8.1.1. Procedures herein will not be less restrictive than those contained elsewhere in this
   instruction. This chapter is not intended to be a single source document for procedures
   contained in other directives or regulations. Avoid unnecessary repetition of guidance
   provided in other established directives; however, reference to those directives is acceptable
   when it serves to facilitate location of information necessary for local operating procedures.
   Each pilot is authorized a copy of this chapter. MAJCOMs or other subordinate agencies
   (Numbered Air Force [NAF], Center, etc.), may direct publications approval channels and a
   specific format for Chapter 8 based on unique flying areas, missions, and/or procedures.
   Unless changed by MAJCOM or subordinate agency, the following procedures apply.
       8.1.1.1. When published, units will forward copies to MAJCOM and appropriate
       subordinate agencies, who will review the Chapter 8 and return comments or required
       changes back to the unit(s), if appropriate. The process need not delay distribution unless
       specified otherwise by MAJCOM or a subordinate agency. If a procedure is applicable to
       all F-15 A-D units, it will be incorporated into the basic instruction.
          8.1.1.1.1. Organize the local chapter in the following format and, as a minimum,
          include the following:
              8.1.1.1.1.1. Section A. Introduction.

   CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH YIELD
                  EXPLOSIVE (CBRNE) OPERATIONS

A2.1. General Information. (T-2).
   A2.1.1. Potential adversary use of CBRNE weapons against a friendly airfield presents a
   serious threat to flying operations. Although the most effective way for aircrews to avoid
   this threat is to be airborne before these weapons are detonated or dispersed and then land at
   a field that has not been contaminated, all personnel must be prepared to operate from a field
   that has come under CBRNE attack.
A2.2. Mission Preparation. (T-2).
   A2.2.1. Be aware of the status of the CBRNE environment at the planned launch and
   recovery airfields, potential divert bases, and throughout the area in which the sortie may fly.
   Know the current and forecast surface wind direction and on the MOPP level in effect for
   relevant sectors of the airfield. Don appropriate aircrew chemical defense equipment
   (ACDE) or Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) to match the appropriate MOPP level (reference
   AFPAM 10-100, Airman’s Manual) and carry individual protective equipment (IPE) as
   required.
A2.3. Stepping to Fly and Aircraft Preflight. (T-2).
   A2.3.1. This may entail donning ACDE or transitioning from GCE to ACDE.                 Take
   precautions to protect aircrew from injury and or contamination while in transit from the
   squadron facility to the aircraft. If possible, transport aircrew in a vehicle that provides
   overhead cover (enclosed vehicle). If aircrew travel on foot is unavoidable, choose a route
   that takes maximum advantage of available overhead cover (sun shades, buildings, etc.)
   to avoid agents that may be settling from the air. If extra aircrew members are available for
   preflight duties, consider assigning them to do so wearing GCE. This will allow the aircrew
   actually flying to minimize exposure.
       A2.3.1.1. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) Prior to Engine Start. If Alarm Red
       occurs during the step or preflight process, take cover and don appropriate MOPP. This
       may require use of the ground crew mask. A hardened aircraft shelter (HAS) provides
       optimum protection, if available. Use caution if entering a HAS that contains aircraft or
       equipment. Close doors after entry. If a HAS or other overhead cover is not immediately
       available, accept the best rapidly reachable cover.
A2.4. Engine Start to Takeoff. (T-2).
   A2.4.1. If a HAS is available, use it to minimize exposure time by accomplishing aircraft
   arming and EOR procedures inside the HAS (if local procedures permit) and by delaying taxi
   time as long as possible prior to takeoff.
       A2.4.1.1. Aircraft Launch to Survive. Units will develop local procedures to provide
       this option to the commander. In general, aircraft may launch-to-survive any time after
       engine start if they have sufficient fuel and safe, expeditious access to a runway. This
       option may only be practical for aircraft that are near the EOR prior to takeoff or that
       have just landed.
 56                                                    AFI11-2F-15V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


      A2.4.1.2. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) Prior to Taxi. If in a HAS, the normal
      procedure is to shut down. Ensure ground personnel are aware of the alarm warning, as
      engine noise may preclude effectiveness of normal alert notification procedures. Use
      hand signals if necessary to be sure that ground personnel assume proper MOPP and
      close HAS doors. If not in a HAS, procedures may include launch to survive.
      A2.4.1.3. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) After Taxi. Units typically establish
      procedures for this contingency depending on whether additional protection is available
      along the taxi route. For instance, if empty HAS are available, taxiing aircraft may be
      directed to shelter there. Ideally, ground crew sheltering in such a HAS would be
      available to assist in normal engine shutdown procedures and to close HAS doors. If
      protection is not available, the best option may be launch to survive. Maintain contact
      with Command and Control (C2) entities (Wing Operations Center, Maintenance
      Operations Center, Supervisor of Flying, etc.) to ensure unity of effort in the overall plan.
A2.5. Takeoff to Landing. (T-2).
   A2.5.1. Contamination. If Chemical Warfare (CW) agent contamination occurs prior to
   takeoff, flying the aircraft will dissipate the agent to some degree. The greatest dissipation
   will occur during flights at lower altitudes and longer airborne times. Because the agent may
   have entered wheel wells, flaps, etc., consider flying in landing configuration to increase
   airflow to these areas. However, merely flying the aircraft is unlikely to achieve complete
   decontamination.
   A2.5.2. Preparing to Land. Aircrew should remain aware of the status of primary and
   alternate landing locations. Do not attempt to land during Alarm Red situations unless there
   is no other option. Follow C2 directions and either hold or divert. If mission needs prevent
   divert, hold until the Alarm Red (or theater equivalent) has cleared or become an Alarm
   Black. Prior to landing, gain awareness of contaminated sectors of the airfield and of
   current/forecast surface winds. Use this information in conjunction with C2 direction to plan
   a route from landing to engine shutdown. The liquid deposition phase following a CW
   airburst attack can extend up to 1 hour. If landing during Alarm Black, expect a
   contaminated environment and MOPP 4.
A2.6. Landing to Engine Shutdown. (T-2).
   A2.6.1. Take advantage of any protection available, minimizing taxi time and distance.
   Maintain contact with C2 in order to remain aware of unexploded ordnance and/or damage to
   airfield movement surfaces. If a HAS is available and local procedures permit, accomplish
   aircraft de-arm and EOR procedures there. If Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) occurs
   between landing and engine shutdown, considerations are similar to those in para A2.4
A2.7. After Engine Shutdown. (T-2).
   A2.7.1. Don appropriate MOPP. If circumstances permit, accomplish normal post-flight
   inspection procedures. If the aircraft is not contaminated, close the canopy. If there is any
   suspicion of personnel contamination, aircrew will process through an aircrew contamination
   control area (ACCA). Accomplish maintenance debriefings under cover to the maximum
   extent possible.
