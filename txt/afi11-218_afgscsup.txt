 1.7.1. Additional training requirements are in AFGSCI36-2251. (AFRC units comply with
 MAJCOM policy).
 1.9. Use of Simulators. The Maintenance Training Flight (MTF) notifies the wing simulator
 training officer of Aircrew Training Devices (ATD) requirements. See AFI 21-101 and AFI 21-
 101, AFGSC Supplement for alternate evaluation/certification procedures if training devices are
 not available. (AFRC units comply with AFI21-101 and AFRC Supplement 1)
 1.10.2. Document training certification/proficiency in Maintenance Information System (MIS).
 Specific engine qualifications and procedures to include re-certification are outlined in AFI 21-
 101 and AFI 21-101, AFGSC Supplement. (AFRC units comply with AFI21-101 and AFRC
 Supplement 1)
 1.11.1. Maintenance personnel do not taxi aircraft.

1.11.4. (Added) Safe ground handling of aircraft is totally dependent upon positive
communication, using eye contact and marshaling signals, between the pilot and ground
marshalers. The pilot and ground marshalers monitor the wing tip walkers. The ultimate
responsibility for the aircraft rests with the pilot. Ground marshalers provide the pilot with
correct and timely marshaling signals. If aircraft movement differs in speed or direction from the
marshaler's desires, the marshaler gives the pilot the SLOWDOWN/STOP signal. When further
movement can be accomplished safely, continue marshaling the aircraft to the proper position.
1.11.5. (Added) High Speed Taxi checks are accomplished IAW AFI 21-101 and AFI 21-101,
AFGSC Supplement. (AFRC units comply with AFI21-101 and AFRC Supplement 1)
1.12.1. Additional tow requirements are outlined in AFOSH Standard 91-100.
1.12.2. Document training (test completion) in MIS.
1.12.3. (Added) Maintenance personnel authorized to occupy cockpit positions of B-1B, B-2, B-
52, EC-130H, E-3B/C, E-4B, RC-/TC-/OC-/WC-135, or U-2 aircraft are certified as tow brake
operators by a qualified tow supervisor.
1.12.4. (Added) Follow all towing procedures listed in applicable towing checklists when towing
aircraft without brake pressure. In addition, the following requirements apply:
1.12.4.1. (Added) MXG/CC or designated representative approve all towing without brake
pressure when there is no specific MDS technical data guidance.
1.12.4.2. (Added) Radio communication is available throughout the entire towing operation to
maintain communications with the MOC/Control Tower, as applicable.
1.12.4.3. (Added) Additional personnel are required to chock walk the aircraft. Position
personnel outboard of each landing gear strut requiring chocks in accordance with applicable
towing checklist. Each individual drags or carries a minimum of one chock. Ensure additional
chocks are available to properly chock the aircraft in the event of an emergency stop.
1.12.4.4. (Added) In the event of an emergency stop where the towing vehicle cannot stop the
aircraft, the chock walkers insert, from the side, a chock in the front or rear of their respective
landing gear tires, depending on forward or aft movement. The chock walkers should attempt to
insert the chocks simultaneously, if possible. WARNING: Personnel inserting chocks in an
emergency, while the aircraft is moving, immediately move in the opposite direction the aircraft
is moving in the event the chock is ejected.
1.12.5. (Added) Prior to towing an aircraft from fuel cell hangars or designated fuel locations,
the tow team supervisor coordinates with the fuel section supervisor to ensure the aircraft is
safely configured to tow.
1.12.6. (Added) Refer to applicable aircraft towing checklist for emergency stop communication
equipment.
1.13.1. Personnel who marshal aircraft take a written marshaling test administered by the MTF.
(In AFRC units the maintenance training manager will control test.) Minimum passing score is
70 percent corrected to 100 percent. Trainers will conduct practical evaluations in the duty
section. Evaluate all marshaling signals applicable to unit/MDS. Marshalling recurring training is
required every 36 months.

1.13.2. Document training in CFETP or AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard,
Continuation/Command JQS; and/or MIS. Aircrew personnel may satisfy this requirement in
conjunction with their check ride as long as all of the specific requirements of this paragraph are
met and there is specific documentation for marshaling training.
1.15.5. (Added) Establish a unit supplement to this directive and include the maximum RPM
limitations for parking areas and other high traffic/congested areas. It may also include minimum
fuel loads or any local restrictions for engine runs.
1.15.6. (Added) The fire chief determines if a fire fighting vehicle stands by in the immediate
vicinity when an aircraft is in an isolated area.
1.15.7. (Added) During preserved engine runs and engine runs for fuel/oil line and component
leak checks this requirement will have a vehicle standing by and will be released at the discretion
of the production superintendent. When used, this vehicle remains in position until the integrity
of the fuel/oil system is verified. A standby fire fighting vehicle is not required during external
fuel tank leak and transfer checks. Ensure adequate lighting is used during night engine runs to
facilitate leak detection.
1.15.7.1. (Added) Notify the control tower and fire department anytime cartridge starts are
scheduled.
1.15.8. (Added) Use a qualified pilot team on B-52 aircraft when more than four engines are run

required by MDS tech data) on their responsibilities and performs normal launch procedures.
The assistant (when required by MDS tech data) stands by the fire bottle through engine start
sequence and then performs duties as directed by the crew chief. NOTE: Contracted
maintenance may be exempted from this requirement; however, personnel will use applicable
aircraft launch/recovery and servicing technical data and comply with all manpower and safety
requirements.
