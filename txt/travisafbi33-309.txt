This instruction implements Department of Defense (DoD) Directive (DoDD) 5015.2, DoD

Management. Information in the instructions is directed by Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-332,
Privacy Act Program. It establishes guidelines and procedures for proper destruction of privacy
act and personally identifiable information. This instruction applies to all units assigned,
attached, tenant or associate to the 60th Air Mobility Wing. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field
through Major Command (MAJCOM) publications/forms managers. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance
with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. The use of the

1. General.
   1.1. This instruction provides procedures to ensure proper safeguard and destruction of hard
   copies of Privacy Act (PA) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) material.
   1.2. All offices of records are required to ensure the proper destruction of paper products as
   outlined in AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, paragraph 10.3.

     1.3. Effective immediately, strip-cut shredders for the destruction of PA/PII, FOUO, and
     Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) are no longer authorized on Travis Air Force
     Base. All document destruction on Travis Air Force Base must be completed with a cross-
     cut shredder or an approved GSA shredder listed on Attachment 2.
     1.4. The PA monitors for each unit will be responsible to ensure the correct shredders are in
     place within their organizations. The Base Records Manager (BRM) will check for
     compliancy when conducting Staff Assistance Visits (SAV) with the Functional Area
     Records Managers (FARM).
        1.4.1. Once the BRM has determined the shredders are acceptable, he/she will place an
        approval label on those shredders. The approved shredders will thereby be the only
        authorized shredders for destroying PA/PII, FOUO, and CUI.
2. Zero Trash Guidance.
     2.1. All Critical Information List (CIL) and office generated paper products (i.e., post-it
     notes, scratch paper, etc.) containing PA/PII, FOUO, and CUI should be destroyed via the
     aforementioned methods."
3. Disposal.
     3.1. Once papers are destroyed, units will continue to dispose of their PA/PII, FOUO, and
     CUI as outlined in their respective waste contracts.
4. Implementation.
     4.1. Units must implement this instruction within six months of final signature or by end of
     Fiscal Year 2011, whichever is later.
