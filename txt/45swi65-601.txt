                                           Chapter 1

                         LOCAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

1.1. Introduction: Local policies and procedures have been developed to implement DoD
directives and Air Force instructions.
1.2. Policies and Procedures.
   1.2.1. Customer Financial Liaison: The primary financial liaison between customers and
   45 SW is the Job Order Manager (JOM). All financial matters shall be handled on this level.
   The primary responsibility of the JOM is to safeguard 45 SW financial assets by ensuring
   adherence to applicable laws, regulations, AFIs, and policies.
   1.2.2. Institutional Job Order Number (JON): All work performed and material consumed in
   support of a 45 SW program having an institutional JON must be recorded to that JON.
   1.2.3. Reimbursable JON: All work performed and material consumed in support of a
   program having a reimbursable JON must be recorded to that JON. Commodities in support
   of reimbursable JONs include civil service labor (fully burdened), contract labor (fully
   burdened), material, minor construction, utilities, equipment, supplies, items damaged or
   consumed during testing (launch), and any resource or item maintained for a particular
   customer. It is imperative to keep the number of JONs for each customer to a minimum.
   The 45 SW Comptroller determines the appropriate number of JONs for each customer.
   1.2.4. Cost Estimates: Estimates of reimbursable costs are based on user-stated, as well as,
   45 SW derived requirements using the best available data and cost projection factors.
   Estimates are intended for use in programming and budgeting by both the wing (including
   wing support contractors) and customer.
   1.2.5. Full up-front funding is required from all customers unless an official agreement
   (Memorandum of Agreement, Support Agreement, Joint Operating Procedures, etc.) is in
   place detailing another funding arrangement. The JOM shall provide the customer with an
   annual estimate and shall obtain from the customer a funding document for that amount at
   the beginning of the fiscal year (FY). Aspects of the funding process are identified in
   Chapter 3 of this instruction.
   1.2.6. If it is determined that an estimate and/or a customer’s historical costs do not exceed
   $500, 45 SW Comptroller may determine that it is in the best interest of the wing to forgo
   establishing a reimbursable JON.
   1.2.7. Civilian Labor Costs: 45 SW civilian employees are to charge their time to a
   customer’s JON when they are actually performing work on that customer’s behalf. This
   procedure applies to all range mission-specific customers and tenant organizations, as
   appropriate. It is highly recommended that Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) activities be
   used for this support. Instructions on establishment and recording WBS activities may be
   obtained from 45 SW/FMAP.
   1.2.8. Cancellation Policy: Range users shall be billed all direct costs attributable to a slip,
   abort, scrub or cancellation regardless of circumstances contributing to the cause.
4                                                            45SWI65-601 19 MARCH 2010


    1.2.9. Working Capital Fund. Although support is provided locally by these organizations,
    they are not part of the 45 SW; therefore, support provided cannot be charged to a 45 SW
    JON. Customers should check with WCF organizations to set up separate funding
    arrangements. The following local organizations are currently operating under WCF
    guidelines.
       1.2.9.1. Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS).
       1.2.9.2. Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).
       1.2.9.3. Defense Reutilization and Marketing Organization (DRMO).
45SWI65-601 19 MARCH 2010                                                                      5

                                           Chapter 5

                          RANGE COST ESTIMATING PROCESS

5.1. Introduction. Cost estimating is the process for maximizing and controlling the use of
resources through planning and budgeting. FM has the responsibility of facilitating the process
of providing a quality estimate to our mission partners.
5.2. Cost Estimating Tools and Services.
     5.2.1. Tools. The quality of an estimate depends on the estimator’s technical, programmatic
     and financial knowledge, training, skills and insight, combined with the use of DoD, Air
     Force and 45 SW Policies and Directives and computerized financial tools provided by the
     Comptroller Financial Information System (CFIS).
     5.2.2. Services. The JOM must work closely with other 45 SW organizations (i.e., PSMs,
     LSIMs, FPMs, and Wing Planning Engineers (WPEs)) to obtain cost estimating information.
5.3. Required Cost Estimates:
     5.3.1. Cost estimates supporting the UDS requirements (Note: All time spent developing
     estimates is a direct cost and billable to the customer unless specified otherwise):
        5.3.1.1. SC Estimate. This estimate addresses customer and range requirements that may
        not be completely defined or are only known in general terms. This estimate is a Rough
        Order of Magnitude (ROM), is entered into ACES upon receipt of SC, and is provided to
        the customer in a timely manner.
        5.3.1.2. Program Support Plan (PSP) Estimate. Includes cost estimates for implementing
        detailed customer requirements, 45 SW policies, directives and the Range Safety
        Operations Requirements (RSOR). If required by customer, the PSP responds to the
        Program Requirements Document (PRD). The PSP must be approved by the user agency
        and notification given to proceed, taking into consideration the identified lead times.
        This estimate updates the SC estimate, is entered into ACES and is provided to the
        customer in a timely manner, but should still be considered a ROM.
        5.3.1.3. Operations Directive (OD) Estimate.         Includes final cost estimates for
        implementing customer requirements, 45 SW policies, directives and the RSOR. The
        estimate is usually per launch or Operation (OP) and for each scheduled launch or OP.
        The OD is based on requirements as defined in the Operations Requirements (OR)
        document. It should be understood that further requirements or refinements arising after
        the date of the OD may result in increased cost and/or the identification of requirements
        which the government is unable to support. No updates to the final launch estimate after
        30-day launch window are required, unless requested by customer. This estimate updates
        the PSP estimate and shall be entered into ACES and provided to the customer in a timely
        manner and reflects as accurate an estimate as possible based on all known requirements.
        5.3.1.4. Fiscal Year (FY) Cost Estimates for Range JONs. Initial FY cost estimates must
        be provided for each reimbursable JON based on customer-supplied requirements. JOM
        accomplishes this by distributing a call for estimates to CCMs. CCMs provide estimates
        based on customer requirements. JOM ensures that estimates are input for all applicable
45SWI65-601 19 MARCH 2010                                                                    11


       cost centers for each reimbursable JON no later than 31 August of the preceding FY. As
       new or revised customer requirements are identified throughout the FY, or if estimates
       prove to be inaccurate, revised estimates with reasons should be provided by the CCM.
       The estimates should be provided to the customer in a timely manner and in a formal
       package to be signed by the JOM, PSM (as appropriate), and customer.
       5.3.1.5. All estimates linked to UDS shall be reviewed by the PSM, LSIM, or FPM, as
       appropriate, to determine if the estimate incorporates all known requirements.
   5.3.2. Discrete Task Estimates. While related to changes and requirements, specific
   estimates may be required for individual tasks at the time of planning and execution, to
   include AF Form 332s (CE work orders), requirements statements, revisions to SAs, and
   PSP/ODs.
5.4. UDS Program Introduction (PI) Cost Estimating Process.
   5.4.1. The UDS PI cost estimating process for new programs begins when a customer
   deposits funds with the 45 SW for the specific purpose of having a PI reviewed and a SC
   prepared. XP responds by designating a wing planning engineer (WPE) and requesting that a
   JOM be assigned by FM and a JON be established for the program. The WPE schedules a
   formal PI review meeting, which includes a PI call for an estimate.
   5.4.2. XP makes distribution of the PI to functional managers and requests technical and cost
   inputs prior to the PI review meeting.
   5.4.3. CCMs review the PI call for estimate to resolve any questions about requirements with
   XP and to incorporate 45 SW requirements. They then estimate the cost of providing the
   required support to customers. CCMs collect, consolidate and review their cost estimates
   prior to forwarding them to the JOM.
   5.4.4. XP reviews and consolidates PI cost estimates received from CCMs into a total cost
   estimate. The cost estimate is reviewed by the PSM/LSIM as appropriate to ensure that the
   estimate includes all requirements identified in the PI. Any questions arising from this
   review are resolved by FM in coordination with the appropriate CCM/PSM/LSIM.
5.5. Cost Estimating Responsibilities by Organization or Job Title.
   5.5.1. FMAP.
       5.5.1.1. Coordinates cost estimating policy and procedures and develops cost estimating

                 REIMBURSEMENT POLICY CODES FOR CUSTOMERS.

6.1. Introduction. The following reimbursable (RMB) codes are assigned to each customer.
The RMBs act as the filter in the Job Order Cost Accounting System (JOCAS) to determine
reimbursable costs.
6.2. Customers by RMB Code.
     6.2.1. RMB “NR”: Institutional. Tracks programs that are solely supported by 45 SW
     funds. There is no reimbursement.

        6.2.2.1. Air Force and Department of Defense (DoD) Component Activities. All Air
        Force and DoD components reimburse the major ranges and test facilities for direct costs.
        Direct costs include direct support of a particular customer’s program: civil service labor
        (fully burdened), contract labor (fully burdened), material, minor construction, utilities,
        equipment, supplies, items damaged or consumed during testing (launch), and any
        resource or item maintained for a particular customer. (Reference DoD Financial
        Management Regulation (FMR), 7000.14-R, Vol. 11A and Reimbursable Operations,
        Policy and Procedures, Chapter 12).
        6.2.2.2. DoD (Non-Air Force) Tenants. These are organizations receiving support for
        convenience of economy rather than range support. These tenants reimburse for direct
        costs incurred over and above the host’s costs before the tenant’s arrival (Reference AFI
        65-601, Vol l, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Ch 7).
        6.2.2.3. Range Users (Commercial Space Launch Activities). Title 15 of the United

        related facilities provided that DoD is reimbursed for its direct costs accrued in
        supporting the commercial space activities. Direct costs are defined as the actual costs
        that are associated with a commercial launch effort or other commercial space activity
        that would not be borne by the DoD in the absence of the commercial launch effort or
        other commercial activity. Such costs shall include civil service labor (fully burdened),
        contract labor (fully burdened), material, minor construction, utilities, equipment,
        supplies, and any other resources required, consumed or damaged in providing

     6.2.3. RMB “SC”. Intraservice Relationships (Within the Air Force). Air Force Tenants.
     Intraservice support is provided with the same quality of support the 45 SW furnishes to our
     own mission. Follow figure 7.1, AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Chapter 7, in assigning intraservice host
     and tenant funding responsibilities. Reference the specific host-tenant agreement for any
     services not covered by figure 7.1.
     6.2.4. RMB “SF”. Departments and Agencies Outside of the Federal Government.
        6.2.4.1. Non-DoD Federal, State and Local Government Agencies. Direct costs include
