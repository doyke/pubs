        TACTICS DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (TDIP)

3.1. General. The AFISRA TDIP develops, documents and disseminates ISR TTPs to increase
ISR capability. The TDIP is broken into two parts: the TIP and the TAAR. The TIP is used to
identify tactics deficiencies and develop new or improved tactics. AFI 11-260, Tactics
Development Program details the TIP and TRB processes.
   3.1.1. The TDIP ensures lessons learned and tactics improvements are disseminated, acted
   on, and archived for follow-on personnel.
   3.1.2. TIPs and TAARs that generate Action Items will be tracked to completion using
   established procedures.
   3.1.3. Validated TIPs and TAARs will be coordinated with command lessons learned
   manager.
3.2. Tactics Improvement Proposal (TIP). Use the AF IMT 4326, Tactic Improvement
Proposal, IAW AFI 11-260, to address a tactical deficiency or to address new or previously
undocumented tactics found to be effective. The TIP format is in Attachment 3.
   3.2.1. TIPs are used for tactical improvements. The program will not be used to: propose
   architecture modifications, acquire hardware or software, or propose training changes.
   Architectural, hardware or software changes are addressed using the AF Form 1067,
   Modification Proposal through appropriate MDS channels.
   3.2.2. Improvements/changes to tactics that require immediate attention will be submitted
   using the TAAR process.
   3.2.3. TIPs will be submitted through parent operational chain of command then to
   AFISRA/A3OW.
3.3. Tactics After Action Reports (TAAR). The TAAR supports the AFISRA and supported
units by providing timely, tactically-relevant information. TAARs are used to share significant
tactics lessons learned and innovations inside the normal annual TIP process. Units should use
TAARs to report information from: exercises, contingency operations, tactics conferences,
testing, and other events.
   3.3.1. TAARs will be submitted as soon as possible to AFISRA/A3OW. The sample TAAR
   format is in Attachment 4.
   3.3.2. TAARs will be closely coordinated with the 561 JTS.
   3.3.3. TAARs do not replace TIPs, they are used to supplement for the rapid changes in the
   ISR environment. AFISRA/A3OW will review each TAAR to identify testing/exercise
   requirements, coordinate with the applicable testing/exercise agency, and provide feedback to
   the originator. Depending on the size and scope of the TAAR, it may result in a TIP. In this
   case, the originator will be notified and requested to submit a TIP for the next TRB.
3.4. Tactics Review Board (TRB). AFISRA Tactics Review Boards will be held, at a
minimum, annually and follow guidelines spelled out in AFI 11-260 Tactics Development
Program.

                AFISRA WEAPONS SCHOOL BILLET PRIORITIZATION

A5.1. Tier System. Intelligence Weapons Officer (IWO) positions are categorized within a
three-tier system to denote desired experience level for each billet. Individual billets, within a
Tier, will be further prioritized to optimize use of available IWOs. The billet defines required
experience for that position. Priority One billets are required to support warfighting
organizations and should be filled before all others. Additionally, the Tiers themselves are not
prioritized against other Tiers. It is possible to have a high-priority Tier 2 billet filled prior to a
lower-priority Tier 1 billet.
   A5.1.1. Tier 1 positions are normally filled by first assignment weapons officers. Tier 1
   indicates responsibilities commensurate with a Company Grade Officer and will normally
   reside in an operational squadron (i.e. intelligence squadron, information operations
   squadron) or training squadron. Tier 1 jobs are defined as those positions that directly
   support warfighting units or organizations. Tier 1 positions include flying, reconnaissance,
   intelligence, and space operations.
   A5.1.2. Tier 2 positions indicate responsibilities commensurate with a senior captain or field
   grade officer and are normally filled by second assignment weapons officers. For the
   AFISRA, Tier 2 billets are normally associated with Wing, Operational Support Squadron,
   and certain headquarters/center positions. Although Tier 2 assignments denote an experience
   level of a second assignment weapons officer, priority positions may be filled by first
   assignment weapons officers as required.
   A5.1.3. Tier 3 positions are normally filled by graduates with more than 5 years of W-prefix
   experience and indicate responsibility commensurate with a field grade officer. An
   individual can be considered a Tier-3 weapons officer once he completes the 5 year payback.
   A Tier-2 weapons officer can fill a Tier-3 position, if there is no one who meets the payback
   criteria. Conversely, a Tier-3 weapons officer could fill a Tier-2 position, if the individual is
   the only graduate available. Tier 3 assignments include MAJCOM staff, HAF staff, and HQ
   AFISRA staff. Tier 3 billets may also be filled by field grade IWOs that have not fulfilled 5
   years of ―W‖ service.
A5.2. The AFISRA W-Management functional manager (FM), will provide AFPC prioritization
guidance based on deployment schedules, anticipated personnel moves, and other factors bearing
on mission priorities. For example, it could be possible to fill a Tier-2/Priority-1 billet with a
Tier-3 graduate, when all/most of the Tier-3/Priority-1 billets are filled. Assigning a Tier-1 or
Tier-2 graduate to a Tier-3 position requires W-Management FM coordination before taking final
assignment actions.
A5.3. Tier-1 Prioritization and Considerations. AFISRA Tier-1 IWO graduates will be
prioritized according to Table A5.1. Additional general guidelines for prioritizing within Tier-1
include:
   A5.3.1. Is the unit designated a ―must fill‖?
   A5.3.2. Does the unit have an operational mission?
   A5.3.3. Does the unit execute reach back operations?

   A5.3.4. Does the unit have an upcoming deployment commitment?
   A5.3.5. Does the unit have a regularly scheduled deployment rotation?
   A5.3.6. Has the unit IWO position been gapped? If so, for how long?
   A5.3.7. Is there an IWO assigned to a parent or lateral unit on base?
   A5.3.8. What is the officer and enlisted intelligence manning situation at the unit?

A5.4. Tier-2 Prioritization and Considerations. AFISRA Tier-2 IWO graduates will be
prioritized according to Table A5.2. Additional general guidelines for prioritizing within Tier-2
include:
   A5.4.1. Does the unit have an operational mission?
   A5.4.2. Does the unit execute reach back operations?
   A5.4.3. Does the unit have an upcoming deployment commitment?
   A5.4.4. Does the unit have a regularly scheduled deployment rotation?
   A5.4.5. Does the unit provide support to operational units?
   A5.4.6. Has the IWO position been gapped? If so, for how long?

A5.5. Tier-3 Prioritization and Considerations. AFISRA Tier-3 IWO graduates will be
prioritized according to Table A5.3. Additional general guidelines for prioritizing within Tier-3
include:
   A5.5.1. Does the position support operational USAF organizations?
   A5.5.2. Does the duty position require unique IWO experience/expertise?
