Air Sovereignty Alert (ASA) Warning and Reporting Roles and Responsibilities

A8.1. (Added) First Air Force (1st AF) has been an Air Combat Command (ACC) organization
since June 1, 1992. Its subordinate units are located throughout the CONUS. Since October
1997, all combat and support elements have come from the Air National Guard (ANG).

A8.1.1. (Added) The „Steady State‟ units and detachments tasked as ASAs, and/or Warning and
Reporting Agencies (RAs) and supportive to the Operation Noble Eagle (ONE) Mission often
vary based upon mission change and conversion timelines. NOTE: Air Sovereignty Levels
(ASLs), may drive mission requirements that may trigger other units to support an ASA mission.
This may include active duty, ANG, and AFRC assets.

A8.2. (Added) 1st Air Force (Continental US NORAD Region‟s (CONR‟s)) direct reporting
units and locations are shown in Table A8.1.


Table A8.1. (Added) 1st Air Force (1 AF) Direct Reporting Units (DRUs).

        Note 1. EADS is not directly supported by a host-wing, as are HQ 1st
        AF and WADS.


A8.2.1. (Added) Other associated units/agencies tasked to support the CONR Warning and
Reporting requirements can be found in the CDR NORAD CONPLAN 3310 (S/R), Aerospace
Warning, Aerospace Control, Maritime Warning and Control Plan. This plan is classified and
can be found on the RELCAN (Releasable to Canadian and US forces) network.

A8.2.2. (Added) Through 1st AF‟s direct liaison authority granted by HQ USAF, all ANG units
and agencies are responsible for warning and reporting.

NOTE
The above graphic is not all-inclusive of ASA sites; however, offers insight to ONE
mission-supportive unit‟s locations.    The vertical division of the CONUS indicates
operations area (OAs) of both WADS and EADS.

A8.3. (Added) Roles and responsibilities of the above stated and other notional ANG units are:

A8.3.1. (Added) Report all incidents/events, natural or man-made that may impact ASA
capabilities or threaten forces supporting ASA missions. Considerations of threats to ASA
missions should be based on a 100-mile radius area of interest, from each alert facility.

A8.3.1.1. (Added) Reportable incidents/events are characterized by the intentional or accidental
use/release of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE),
terrorist initiatives/activity, hurricanes, earthquakes, commercially-required or Defense Critical
Infrastructure Program (DCIP) concerns, etc. Security Forces, Intelligence, Offices of Special
Investigation, etc. should be integral in assessments of threats to ASA interests.

A8.3.1.2. (Added) Report all mitigating, response, and recovery actions taken, regarding
events/incidents stated above.
