This supplement implements and extends guidance of Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 23-110V2PT13CH9,
Special Purpose Recoverable Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM). This supplement describes 45 SW pro-
cedures for use in conjunction with the basic AFMAN. It applies to all 45 SW activities, tenants and con-
tractors operated or supported by the USAF Standard Base Supply System. This supplement does apply to
Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard units.
9.4.3.2.1. Letters of appointment will be submitted to Base Suply Equipment Management Element.
9.4.4.9.1. (Added) All SPRAM assets that are in SPRAM flag "Z" (other assets) must be re-justified
under one of the remaining categories A-S or turned in. This includes both ERRC XD and XF3 assets. Re-
justification must be submitted on an AF Form 601, Equipment Action Request, to Base Supply Equip-
ment Management for submission through MAJCOM channels.
9.4.4.10.1. (Added) Initial requests for new authorizations or increase/decrease in quantity authorizations

asset is received and picked up on the SPRAM account. At that time, the necessary information must be
provided to complete the processing (for example: organization, shop code, SRD, copy of approved AF
Forms 601).
