quota allocations based on unit inputs and training needs. Unit comments and recommendations
concerning the type or quality of training provided should be coordinated with their
organization’s maintenance training flight or maintenance training office.
3. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a decision-making process to
systematically evaluate possible course of action, identify risks and benefits, and determine the
best course of action for any given situation. Consider ORM principles, concepts, and techniques
in the development, implementation, and application of new or existing training programs.
Additional guidance can be found in AFI 90-901, Operational Risk Management, and AFPAM

materials, and instructor effectiveness. HQ AETC/A4MMR will use student critiques and survey
results to evaluate course and instructor effectiveness, and to initiate changes or improvements as
required.
12. Test Control Procedures. Faculty members will adhere to the following test control
procedures:
     12.1. Store paper copies of course block tests and answer keys in a secured file cabinet.
     Restrict access to faculty members only for electronic versions of block tests stored on local
     area network hard drives. Keep an electronic backup copy of each test on computer media
     (e.g., CD ROM), and store in a secured file cabinet.
     12.2. Only MMS faculty members are authorized to transport paper or electronic copies of
     test material and answer keys for use at TDY locations.
     12.3. A test proctor may administer the end-of-course examination. The MMS commandant
     must approve the use of a test proctor prior to e-mailing the test to the proctor for
     administration. The test proctor is responsible for test material security and for faxing
     completed tests to the MMS for grading and recording in school records. The instructor will
     notify the proctor of the test results by phone and direct the proctor to destroy the original
     copy of the exam. The proctor will provide the MMS with written confirmation that the test
     has been destroyed.
     12.4. Faculty members will document, on a locally developed test control log, when tests are
     removed and replaced from the secure storage area.
