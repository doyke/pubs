SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

1.3.1.1.1. (Added) In the event that an on or off-duty mishap should occur, it is the
responsibility of the individual to report it and fully cooperate in the mishap investigation. It is
imperative that accurate and complete mishap information be reported to ensure proper
precautionary measures can be implemented to prevent future mishaps. To achieve this, all 55th
Wing and associate units will use the OAFB Form 164, Ground Mishap Report. This form
mirrors the information required in the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS) ... the tool
used by the 55th Wing Safety Office to report all Class A, B, C, and D mishaps.

Safety (faxed or e-mailed OAFB Form 164) must be accomplished within 2 duty days of the
