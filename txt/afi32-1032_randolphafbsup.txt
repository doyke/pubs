including tenant organizations.

3.2.2.2. (Added-Randolph AFB) The Base Civil Engineer (BCE) and others on staff present
the FB agenda, provide technical assistance, and record the minutes of the meeting. The FB
agenda is comprised of facility issues, requirements, and programs that have been reviewed and
approved at the FBWG prior to the board meeting. If an organization is dissatisfied with a
FBWG ruling, it may appeal at the FB. The FB will also periodically review the installation’s
long-range plans and future requirements to ensure that facility matters coincide with the wing
strategic plan. The FB chairman resolves any disputed facilities issues with advice from FB
members.

3.2.3. (Added-Randolph AFB) The FBWG, chaired by the 12 MSG/CC, serves as an advisory
group to the FB. The FBWG meets quarterly prior to each FB meeting and consists of the
following voting members:

 12 OSS/CC                             12 OSS/OSAB

3.2.3.2. (Added-Randolph AFB) The BCE and staff prepare the FBWG agenda based on
outstanding real property utilization issues, construction priorities, and other issues that affect the
operation/maintenance of real property and future development. This data is prepared from space
requests and facility work requests received and organized into prioritized listings of each
organization’s requirements staffed through their respective group commander or equivalent.
Requirements should be prioritized in concert with Facility Investment Matrix (FIM) ratings and
should be arranged in at least a five-year program based on need. 12 MSG/CE combines the

individual lists into a wing program. An integrated project list and host/mission partner funded
projects will be approved by the Facilities Board for the allocation of resources in the
Engineering Division. Each organization is encouraged to work with 12 MSG/CE in developing
its facility programs. Squadron/unit commanders are encouraged to voice facility concerns at the
FBWG. The FBWG chairperson resolves any disputed real property or project priority issues at
the FBWG.

3.2.4. (Added-Randolph AFB) The FBWP, chaired by the 12 MSG/CE, serves as an advisory
group to the FBWG. Facilities Board Working Panel meetings are chaired by the Base Civil
Engineer or the Deputy and are open meetings to facility managers or organizational
representatives. The main purpose of this program is to ensure all organizations receive a fair
share of the installation’s limited contract program resources in the accomplishment of their
work requirements. Each organization is encouraged to work with 12 MSG/CE in developing its
facility programs. All racking and stacking is accomplished by the Group Commander or his
representative and then transferred to the appropriate sections of CE. This program gives
Commanders control of the prioritization of all work requirements within their respective groups
and organizations. The Facility Board process divides all of the organizations on Randolph AFB
into 11 main customer categories:
