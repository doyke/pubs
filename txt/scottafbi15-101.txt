 CHARACTERIZATION UNIT (CU) & EXPLOITATION UNIT (EU) INTERACTIONS

1.1. General. The 15th Operational Weather Squadron (15 OWS), the 618th Air & Space
Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center) Weather Directorate, (618 AOC
(TACC)/XOW), and the 375th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (375 OSS/OSW)
are the official weather information agencies for Scott AFB. These agencies provide weather
information in support of the 375 AMW, the 126 ARW (ANG), the 932 AW (AFRES), and units
assigned, attached, or supported by Scott AFB. The 618 AOC (TACC)/XOW is commonly
referred to as TACC/XOW throughout this document. The 375th Operations Support Squadron
Weather Flight (375 OSS/OSW) is commonly referred to as the Weather Flight (WF) and is the
focal point for all weather-related issues. This instruction will be reviewed and revised no
greater than biennially or IAW with host/parent unit procedures if the time is less than biennially.
   1.1.1. The 15 OWS is considered the characterization unit. Characterization encompasses
   the “collect, analyze and predict” weather core competencies. Characterization depends on
   Air Force Weather’s ability to collect accurate data, correctly analyze that data, and use the
   results to produce a coherent picture of the present and future state of the air and space
   environment.
   1.1.2. The 375 OSS/OSW and the TACC/XOW are considered exploitation units.
   Exploitation is the ability to minimize the impact of environmental threats to friendly forces
   while simultaneously capitalizing on environmental conditions that maximize the operational
   advantage over enemy forces. Exploitation units tailor the characterization provided by the
   characterization unit. Tailoring is the extraction of data that is pertinent to a specific mission
   profile from the overall characterization of the air and space environment. Tailoring does not
   mean changing the characterization. To the greatest extent possible exploitation units will
   use the characterized data provided to them.
1.2. Concept of Operations.
   1.2.1. The 15 OWS at Scott AFB, provides regional and operational-level weather products
   and information to Air Force and Army units in the Northeast region of the Continental
   United States.
   1.2.2. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH). The 15 OWS performs a continuous
   METWATCH for Scott AFB. METWATCH is a deliberate, continuous process for
   monitoring terrestrial weather or the space environment in an area or region. The purpose of
   a METWATCH is to identify when and where observed conditions significantly diverge
   from forecast conditions, determine courses of action to update or amend a forecast product
   or group of products, and notify designated agencies.
   1.2.3. The WF and TACC/XOW are the primary source of tailored weather services in
   support of the 375 AMW, the 932 AW, the 126 ARW, various headquarters elements, and
   visiting aircrews. The WF and TACC/XOW will make every effort to ensure that mission-
   limiting weather is anticipated and exploited and that safety and Resource Protection (RP)
   are maintained.

1.3. Responsibilities.
     1.3.1. General responsibilities of the 15 OWS and WF are outlined in AFI 15-128, paragraph
     4.1.
        1.3.1.1. The 15 OWS issues the Scott AFB Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs),
        forecast weather warnings and watches, and may provide flight weather briefings to
        transient aircrews passing through Scott AFB. The 15 OWS will issue observed
        warnings and advisories when the WF is closed.
        1.3.1.2. The WF issues all observed advisories and warnings when the WF is open.
        1.3.1.3. The WF will create Mission Weather Products (MWPs) that fuse theater scale
        products with local mission requirements to enable the direct inject of weather impacts
        into warfighter planning and/or execution. Upon request, the WF will provide flight
        weather briefings and operational weather support for the 932 AW. The WF will also
        provide flight weather briefings for the 458th Airlift Squadron (AS) Formal Training Unit
        (FTU) and transient aircrews IAW the WF duty priorities listed in Table 1.1
        1.3.1.4. TACC/XOW. TACC/XOW provides flight weather briefings and operational
        weather support for the 126 ARW and the 375 AMW (458 AS).
     1.3.2. Scott AFB Installation Data Page. The 15 OWS and Scott WF will coordinate and
     maintain a Scott AFB Installation Data Page detailing the terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF)
     specification and amendment criteria, warning, watches, and advisories (WWA) thresholds,
     desired lead times, mission impacts, unit information, Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET)
     back-up contacts and local outage back-up information.
     1.3.3. Eyes Forward & Collaboration. The Scott WF will act as the eyes forward for the 15
     OWS by relaying significant, time-sensitive meteorological information not found in coded
     meteorological reports to the 15 OWS to assist in forecast operations.
1.4. Duty Priorities. The 375 OSS/OSW Duty Priorities. IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, paragraph
1.3.3.1., the WF has created the following duty priorities based on 375 AMW mission
requirements.

      1.6.1. WF COOP and WF AOL. In the event of a building evacuation, the WF will move to
      building 470 (932 AW Operations building), second floor, room 220/C21, commercial (618)
      256-2589 / DSN 576-2589. WF members will follow duty-specific standard operating
      procedures and evacuation checklists (including a list of required back-up equipment) and
      resume services at the AOL as soon as possible. The flight will continue operational 375
      AMW support and resume eyes forward responsibilities for the 15 OWS. If access to

    observing sensing equipment readouts is lost, manual equipment will be used to take
    observations. Most WF services/support will be provided, but will require a case-by-case
    assessment depending on communication line status, equipment status, etc. Expect most
    services to be somewhat degraded (weather products, pilot briefings, etc.) due to limited
    facilities and loss of dedicated data services, including sensors and various data types
    (meteorological satellite, radar imagery, etc.). For flight safety reasons, the WF will not
    evacuate during exercises.
    1.6.2. The 15 OWS COOP.
       1.6.2.1. For short-term outages (up to 72 hours), the WF will assume local TAF and
       weather watch, warning and advisory responsibility.
       1.6.2.2. For long-term outages (greater than 72 hours), the 15 OWS’ plan is to resume all
       support from an alternate location.
       1.6.2.3. Exercises. In coordination with WFs, the 15 OWS conducts periodic COOP
       exercises.
    1.6.3. TACC COOP.
       1.6.3.1. IAW AMCI 15-101, if the TACC/XOW loses the capability to provide flight
       weather briefing services, the WF will assume responsibility for all Scott AFB Integrated
       Flight Management (IFM) and non-IFM weather packages. If the WF is unable to
       provide the required support, briefing responsibility will be transferred to the servicing
       the 15 OWS.
       1.6.3.2. Global Decision Support System (GDSS) Outages. In the event of a GDSS
       outage, the WF provides MWPs via DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing, or verbal
       briefing. Servicing the 15 OWS’ provide DD Forms 175-1 via email or verbal briefing.
       1.6.3.3. Exercises. In coordination with WFs, TACC/XOW conducts COOP exercises
       during which the WF provides MWPs through GDSS or alternate means if a GDSS
       outage is simulated. WFs will coordinate with supported units as required.

                                   AIRFIELD SERVICES

2.1. General. Airfield services include those actions affecting the Scott aerodrome (defined
within 5NM of the airfield) or the base as a whole.
2.2. Observations. Observations are taken, recorded, and disseminated IAW AFMAN 15-111,
Surface Weather Observations, utilizing the FMQ-19 AMOS. Most observations are taken
automatically by the FMQ-19 with no human intervention. At times, it is necessary for a
weather forecaster to augment the system. Automated and augmentation processes are outlined
in paragraph 2.2.7 The following observations are created and disseminated:
   2.2.1. Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR). METAR observations are created
   between 45 and 59 minutes after every hour. METARs are disseminated both locally and
   long-line between 55 and 59 minutes after the hour.
   2.2.2. Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI). SPECI is an unscheduled
   observation completed and transmitted when any of the Scott AFB special criteria listed in
   Attachment 3 have been observed or sensed. SPECI will contain all data elements found in
   a METAR plus additional remarks that elaborates on data in the body of the report. All
   SPECI reports will be prepared and transmitted as soon as possible after the relevant criteria
   are observed. Attachment 5 contains an example SPECI weather observation.
   2.2.3. Aviation Selected Local Weather Report (LOCAL). During augmentation, the WF
   will take single element LOCAL observations for altimeter setting changes.
   2.2.4. Official Observing Points. The official observing point is the location of the FMQ-19
   sensors. During periods of augmentation, the observation point will be approximately 125
   feet away from the East side of building 433 (Hangar 1). During relocations to the AOL, and
   augmentation is required, the observation point is marked by a compass rose approximately
   35 foot from the AOL flightline exit door.
   2.2.5. Observing Point Limitations.
       2.2.5.1. The FMQ-19 is properly sited and no limitations are currently noted.
       2.2.5.2. Augmented observations taken at the primary augmentation site (building 433)
       are degraded because the observer’s view to the west is blocked by an aircraft hangar and
       thunder may not be heard due to flightline noise.
       2.2.5.3. Augmented observations taken at the AOL are degraded because building 470
       blocks view to the west.
   2.2.6. Automated FMQ-19 Observation. An automated observation is any observation
   having been evaluated, prepared, and transmitted by an observing system without human
   intervention. In automated mode, the FMQ-19 observing system will record and disseminate
   weather observations. The FMQ-19 uses time averaging of sensor data. In an automated
   observation, sky condition will be an evaluation of sensor data gathered during the 30-minute
   period ending at the actual time of the observation. All other elements evaluated are based
   on sensor data that is within 10 minutes or less of the actual time of the observation.

   2.2.7. Forecaster FMQ-19 Augmentation. Augmentation is the process of having a certified
   weather forecaster manually add or edit data to an observation generated by the FMQ-19.
   WF personnel do not augment the FMQ-19 when the airfield is closed except when tornadic
   activity is occurring or forecast to occur. The two augmentation processes used are
   supplementing and back up.
      2.2.7.1. Supplementing (definition). Manually adding meteorological information to an
      observation generated by the FMQ-19 that is beyond that system’s capability to measure
      and report. For example, the sensor cannot sense a tornado or hail.
      2.2.7.2. Supplementing procedures. WF personnel will supplement observations when the
      airfield is open and the weather conditions in Table 2.1 are observed. WF personnel will be
      ready to supplement observations if the conditions in Table 2.1 are forecast to occur within 2
      hours. Weather personnel are required to log on to an AMOS and be prepared to supplement
      whenever a watch or warning has been issued for tornadic activity.

Table 2.1. Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions.
Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions – Body of Report (Note 1)
Tornado (+FC) (Note 2) (Note 3)
Funnel Cloud (FC) (Note 2) (Note 3)
Waterspout (+FC) (Note 2) (Note 3)
Hail (GR)
Volcanic Ash (VA)
Ice Pellets (IP)
Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions – Remarks Section of Report (Note 1)
Funnel Cloud (Tornadic Activity_B/E(hh)mm_LOC/DIR_Moving (MOV)) (Note 2)
Hail Size
Snow Depth (Note 4)(only during airfield operating hours and if heavy snow warning has been
issued and snowfall is occurring)
Notes:
1. References for coding augmentable weather conditions are located in Chapter 13.
2. The immediate reporting of funnel clouds takes precedent over any other phenomenon.
3. Log on to AMOS and be prepared to supplement for tornadic activity anytime a weather watch
or warning has been issued for the phenomena.
4. All Remarks and Additive Data references are provided in AFMAN 15-111, Attachment 3.

      2.2.7.3. Backup (definition). The process of manually providing meteorological data
      and/or dissemination of an FMQ-19 generated observation when the primary automated
      method is not operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure.
      2.2.7.4. Backup procedures. In the event of FMQ-19 malfunction or failure, back-up
      procedures will be implemented only during airfield operating hours and/or if tornadic
      activity is occurring or forecast to occur. WF personnel will use manual observing
SCOTTAFBI15-101 5 MARCH 2013                                                                   11


       procedures when performing back-up operations. When required, the WF will encode
       and disseminate METAR and SPECI observations IAW AFMAN 15-111 Table 3.2. All
       element entries must be observed within 15 minutes of the actual time of the observation
       with the exception of wind gusts and squalls, which are reported only if they are observed
       within 10 minutes of the time of the observation. When utilizing back-up equipment, all
       wind and pressure values must be estimated.
2.3. TAF Support. Scott AFB TAFs are produced and disseminated by the 15 OWS IAW AFI
15-128, AFMAN 15-124, AFMAN 15-129V1, and the Scott AFB Installation Data Page.
Attachment 4 lists forecast specification and amendment criteria. TAFs are valid for 30 hours,
apply to the area within the 5NM area of the Scott AFB airfield complex, and will be issued at
0000, 0800, and 1600 Zulu time. Attachment 5 contains examples of typical Scott AFB TAFs.
2.4. Resource Protection (RP) Support & Warnings, Watches and Advisories (WWA). The
15 OWS conducts a continuous meteorological watch to identify and assess emerging and
imminent threats to Scott AFB. Special Weather Statements (SWS) and WWAs are special
notices provided by the 15 OWS resulting from both the forecast and METWATCH processes to
assist military decision makers with resource and RP decisions. Watches and warnings provide
notice of weather events posing a hazard to life or property. Advisories provide specific notice
to an operational agency of environmental phenomena with the potential to impact operations.
Customer responses to WWAs are listed in Attachment 6.
   2.4.1. SWS. SWS’ are special notices issued by the 15 OWS to assist military decision
   makers with RP decisions.
   2.4.2. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice to installation
   personnel/supported units of a potential for environmental conditions of such intensity as to
   pose a hazard to life or property. They are used by installation personnel/supported units to
   make force protection and risk management decisions. Watches are issued for a 5NM radius
   of the center point of the Scott runway complex and are defined in Table 2.2

Table 2.2. Weather Watches.

    2.4.3. Weather Warnings. A special notice to notify installation personnel when an
    established weather condition of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property is
    occurring or is expected to occur. Weather warnings provide concise information outlining
    environmental threats and are used by commanders and personnel to make RP decisions and
    take protective action. Warnings are issued for a 5NM radius at the center point of the
    runway and are defined in Table 2.3

Table 2.3. Weather Warnings.

    2.4.4. Observed Weather Warnings. Lightning warnings are the only observed warning
    issued for Scott AFB and extends 5NM in all directions from the airfield. Lightning
    warnings are not issued until lightning is observed, either visually or via the National
    Lightning Detection Network. The lightning warning will remain valid until lightning is no
    longer observed within 5NM for at least 15 minutes. Exception: A lightning warning will
    not be cancelled if a thunderstorm is within 5NM (as indicated on radar).
    2.4.5. Observed Weather Advisories. An observed weather ADVISORY is a special product
    notifying an end user when an established environmental condition effecting operations is
    occurring or is expected to occur on Scott AFB and are defined in Table 2.4

Table 2.4. Observed Weather Advisories.
                   Criteria                                   Forecast/Observed

 gusts) and worst case observed direction including variability.
SCOTTAFBI15-101 5 MARCH 2013                                                                     13


   2.4.6. WWA Numbering Scheme. Advisories, watches, and warnings are numbered
   consecutively by identifying the type of weather message (watch, warning, or advisory)
   followed by a five-digit number. The first two numbers indicate the current month while the
   second three numbers indicate the sequence number. For example, the message “Weather
   Warning 02-005” means the month is February (02) and this is the fifth (005) warning issued
   in the month. The message “Weather Advisory 12-013” means the month is December (12)
   and this is the 13th advisory issued in the month. Examples of different messages are
   contained in Attachment 5.
   2.4.7. WWA Upgrades/Downgrades. WWAs will be upgraded (i.e., winds increase from 35
   knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the desired lead times
   specified in Tables 2.3 and 2.4 Only one warning will be in effect at a given time (and will
   include multiple warning criteria as required) except for forecast tornado warnings and/or
   observed lightning warnings. Tornado and lightning will be separate warnings. With the
   exception of tornado and lightning warnings, if a warning is issued for one criteria and it
   becomes necessary to warn for another criteria, a new warning and new number will be
   issued, to include all criteria expected. Specify a separate valid time or each criteria if
   necessary.
   2.4.8. WWA Amendments. When WWAs no longer adequately describe the phenomenon's
   expected occurrence, a completely new WWA with a new number will be issued. The
   amendment will clearly state how the amendment or extension affects any previously issued
   notices.
   2.4.9. WWA Extensions. WWAs may be extended provided the extension is issued prior to
   the expiration of the original notice.
   2.4.10. WWA Cancellation. Warnings and watches are canceled when the weather
   phenomena is no longer occurring or expected to occur. Warnings not extended or canceled
   will automatically expire at the end of the valid period. Observed advisories will be canceled
   when the criteria is no longer occurring and have not occurred in the last 30 minutes. See
   paragraph 2.4.4 for cancellation of observed lightning warnings.
2.5. Dissemination Process.
   2.5.1. Observations. Observations taken by either the FMQ-19 automated observing system
   or the weather technician are disseminated via JET. When JET is nonoperational, the WF
   will relay observations to the following local organizations in order of priority listed in Table
   2.5

Table 2.5. Notification Priority.
 1. Tower (OSAB) commercial (618) 256-4065.
 2. 375 AMW/CP commercial (618) 256-5891.
 3. 932 AW/CP commercial (618) 256-8373.
 4. 126 ARW/CP (618) 222-4255.
 5. Base operations commercial (618) 256-1861.
 6. 15 OWS.

  2.5.2. TAFs. The 15 OWS disseminates TAFs via JET. If JET is nonoperational, the WF
  will disseminate TAFs to ATC and 375 AMW/CP via telephone, fax, or e-mail.
  2.5.3. SWS’. SWS’ provide advance notice of widespread hazardous weather conditions
  that have the potential to affect Scott AFB. The 15 OWS transmits SWS’ to WF leadership
  via email. WF leadership forwards SWS’ to 375 AMW leadership.
  2.5.4. WWAs. The 15 OWS or WF will enter WWAs into JET which will disseminate the
  information to ATC, 375 AMW/CP, 126 ARW/CP, and 375 OSS Airfield Management
  (OSA/OSAA). If JET is out-of-service, 15 OWS or the WF will make back-up calls. Upon
  notification, these units will further disseminate all WWAs using the pyramid notification
  scheme shown in Figure 2.1 In addition, the 375 AMW/CP disseminates all WWAs via e-
  mail and/or AtHoc.
     2.5.4.1. Lightning Warnings. All lightning warnings are disseminated by the 375
     AMW/CP to the base populace via the giant voice system, allowing members on base to
     be prepared for dangerous weather. E-mails and/or AtHoc are used as well, 24 hours a
     day.
     2.5.4.2. Tornado Warnings. The 375 AMW/CP has the primary responsibility for
     sounding the base siren for a tornado warning issuance. In the event the CP system is
     malfunctioning, 375 OSS/OSA will sound the siren. E-mails and/or AtHoc are used as
     well.

2.6. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). The WF and ATC have established a CWW as
required by AFI 13-204V3 and AFMAN 15-111. The agreement outlines the ATC responsibility
to notify the WF when ATC personnel observe specific meteorological phenomena. Of primary
concern is the report of tower visibility differing from the prevailing surface visibility, local
PIREPs, and any occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions that could affect flight
safety or be critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations and resources. All WF
technicians must thoroughly understand and be able to execute every element in the local
cooperative weather watch agreement.
   2.6.1. Scott AFB Tower personnel will notify weather personnel when:
       2.6.1.1. Tower visibility is less than four (4) statute miles (6000 meters) and different
       from the surface prevailing visibility. However, this information is not included in
       observations produced by the FMQ-19.
       2.6.1.2. PIREPs are received of previously unreported weather conditions that could
       affect flight safety or be critical to the safety and efficiency of other local operations and
       resources.
   2.6.2. ATC Limited Observation Training. The 375 OSS/OSW oversees the Scott AFB
   Limited Observation Training Program. ATC personnel requiring training should contact the

                                     MISSION SERVICES

3.1. General. The WF, 15 OWS, and TACC/XOW support the Scott AFB flying and non-
flying missions. This chapter identifies the flying and non-flying missions and the weather
support provided.
3.2. Flying Missions. The WF and the TACC/XOW provide weather support to the flying units
listed in Attachment 7. The bulk of flying operations at Scott are supported by the
TACC/XOW.
3.3. MWP. MWPs fuse theater scale products with local mission requirements enabling the
direct inject of weather impacts into war fighter planning and/or execution. The result is a
product designed to provide timely, accurate, and relevant environmental information for
planning and execution. The MWPs must be horizontally consistent with (but not necessarily
mirror) products issued by any OWS and Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA).
   3.3.1. Flight Weather MWPs. GDSS is the primary command and control (C2) system used
   to request and receive weather briefings to AMC owned/gained flying units. GDSS provides
   a unique product that incorporates the requirements of all Scott-based flying units into a
   common format (see Attachments 8 and 13 for sample products). Updates can be obtained
   by calling TACC/XOW at DSN 576-0353/Commercial (618) 229-0353, or by contacting the
   WF at DSN 576-5905/Commercial (618) 256-5905.
   3.3.2. The 458 AS FTU Support. The 458 AS’ FTU conducts training for initial qualification
   and instructor candidates in the C-21A. FTU training sorties normally take place at Scott
   AFB or at other regional airfields. Due to the stringent weather requirements for simulated
   emergency procedures and visual flight rules (VFR) pattern training, the 458 AS FTU
   requires a tailored weather product that provides students and instructors the flexibility to
   choose the airfield, which best supports training during the specified training period (see
   Attachment 9 for sample product). Due to these unique mission requirements, the WF has
   obtained an AMC approved waiver to provide all weather briefing support to the 458 AS
   IAW the WF duty priorities listed in Table 1.1
   3.3.3. The 458 AS Take Off and Landing Data (TOLD) Product. The TOLD is 24-hr tailored
   product used for Flight Training Unit planning purposes. The TOLD product is divided into 2-
   hour blocks of expected conditions. It also includes local area TAFs commonly used by the C-21
   crews. Solar/Lunar data, flight hazards, and flight level winds are also included (see Attachment
   9 for sample product). The 458 AS TOLD product will be prepared by the WF daily and posted
   at https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/375oss/OSW/default.aspx
3.4. MISSIONWATCH. This is a deliberate process for monitoring terrestrial weather and/or
the space environment for specific mission-limiting environmental factors.
   3.4.1. WF Briefed Sorties. It is through MISSIONWATCH that MWP amendments/updates
   are accomplished. During rapidly changing weather, the WF will inform the 15 OWS when
   weather products issued by the 15 OWS do not accurately reflect observed conditions and
   impact flight safety. The WF will amend/update the MWP as necessary. In addition, when
   previously unforcasted weather conditions develop that place a mission at risk, the WF will

                                 WEATHER EQUIPMENT

5.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by the WF. Additionally, it provides information on backup
systems, maintenance, and restoring priorities.
5.2. Meteorological Equipment. The WF uses the FMQ-19 and Weather Surveillance Radar,
1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) weather radar to determine the current state of the atmosphere. These
critical systems provide customers the most timely, accurate, and relevant weather intelligence
possible. Note: TMQ-53 is a tactical automated observing system that is used by the WF during
contingency and exercise operations. The TMQ-53 provides a capability that is very similar to
the FMQ-19.
   5.2.1. FMQ-19. The FMQ-19 samples, measures, and reports: temperature, wind speed and
   direction, visibility, cloud base height and amount of coverage, pressure, liquid equivalent
   precipitation accumulation, and ice accretion during freezing precipitation.          These
   measurements are processed to create properly formatted, fully automated observations that
   comply with applicable various reporting standards and protocols defined in the Federal
   Meteorological Handbook (FMH-1), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the
   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Weather Service, and military reporting
   standards.
   5.2.2. WSR-88D. The WF utilizes the WSR-88D as its primary source of radar data.
   Weather technicians make use of an Open Principle User Processor (OPUP) to analyze
   complex radar signatures and obtain detailed information on storm intensity, movement,
   internal circulation, and general wind flow. Weather technicians will routinely incorporate
   the latest radar information into all mission execution forecasts and RP products.
5.3. Communications Equipment. The following systems are the backbone of the WF
communications network:
   5.3.1. JET. As discussed in paragraph 2.5 of this instruction, JET is the primary system for
   disseminating forecast, observations, warnings, watches, and advisories. Telephones are
   used as a backup for key aircraft controlling agencies.
   5.3.2. PMSV Radio. The PMSV Radio (239.8 MHz) allows the WF to communicate with
   aircrews, both on the ground and flying, as well as tower personnel. If the PMSV is out-of-
   service, aircrews can contact Little Rock AFB Weather at 239.8 MHz, TACC/XOW or the
   15 OWS via phone patch (where possible) to get weather data.
   5.3.3. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and hotlines serve primarily for rapidly passing along
   critical, time-sensitive information, as well as to serve for backup services.
   5.3.4. Local Area Network (LAN). The WF relies heavily on the LAN to improve the
   timeliness and accuracy of weather intelligence to our customers.

A4.1. Type of Report. METAR or SPECI.
A4.2. Station identifier, also called the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO). This code identifies the location of the observation (in this case Scott AFB).
A4.3. Date and Time of Report. This is in Zulu (GMT) of the last element of the observation.
A4.4. Report Modifier. The report modifier can be either of the following two elements:
   A4.4.1. COR is entered into the report modifier group when a corrected METAR or SPECI
   is transmitted.
   A4.4.2. AUTO identifies the report as a fully automated report with no human intervention.
       A4.4.2.1. AUTO is automatically included in reports when the weather technician signs
       off the AMOS indicating the observations are no longer being augmented.
       A4.4.2.2. AUTO and COR will not be seen in the same observation. If the term COR is
       used, the observation cannot be reported as AUTO, since a weather technician is
       manually correcting the observation.
A4.5. Wind. The true direction the wind is blowing from is encoded in tens of degrees using
three figures. Directions less than 100 degrees are preceded with a "0." The wind speed is
entered as a two- or three-digit group immediately following the wind direction.
   A4.5.1. Gust. The wind gust is encoded in two or three digits immediately following the
   wind speed. The wind gust is encoded in whole knots using the units and tens digits and, if
   required, the hundreds digit.
   A4.5.2. Variable Wind Direction (speeds 6 knots or less). Variable wind direction with
   wind speed 6 knots or less may be encoded as VRB in place of the direction.
   A4.5.3. Variable Wind Direction (speeds greater than 6 knots). Wind direction varying 60
   degrees or more with wind speed greater than 6 knots will be encoded. The variable wind
   direction group will immediately follow the wind group. The directional variability will be
   encoded in a clockwise direction. For example, if the wind is variable from 180 degrees to
   240 degrees at 10 knots, it would be encoded 21010KT 180V240.
   A4.5.4. Calm Wind. Calm wind is encoded as 00000KT.
A4.6. Visibility. The furthest predominant distance (at least 50% of the aerodrome) seen from
the airfield reported in statute miles. The most common visibility reported is 7 miles.
A4.7. Runway Visual Range.
A4.8. Present weather. Any weather phenomenon occurring on the airfield. This is mandatory
anytime the visibility is less than 7 miles. Table A5.2 lists the present weather codes:

A4.9. Sky Condition and Cloud Height. Describes the amount of clouds present at the airfield
and the base of each cloud deck. They fall into the following categories:
   A4.9.1. SKC – Sky Clear.
   A4.9.2. FEW – 1/8 to 2/8 coverage.
   A4.9.3. SCT – Scattered; 3/8 to 4/8 coverage.
   A4.9.4. BKN – Broken; 5/8 to 7/8 coverage.
   A4.9.5. OVC – Overcast; 8/8 coverage.
   A4.9.6. VV – Vertical visibility; normally used during heavy fog, indicates how far up into
   the fog can be seen.
   A4.9.7. FEW000 – Surface-based obscuration.
   A4.9.8. Cloud Height. Three-digit number provides the height of the base of the cloud in
   hundreds of feet (e.g., 015 equals 1,500 feet). The Cumulonimbus and Towering Cumulus
   (TCU) descriptors may be appended to the cloud height to indicate the cloud is a
   cumulonimbus or towering cumulus.
