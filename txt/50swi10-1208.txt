1. Launch Readiness.
    1.1. Launch readiness is a process used to notify the 50 Space Wing Commander (50
    SW/CC) of pending satellite launches and launch preparation activities. Launch readiness
    provides the 50 SW/CC with information necessary to assess the 50 SW’s readiness to
    support satellite launches, such as those which the 50 SW holds Satellite Control Authority
    (SCA). Launch readiness applies to launches requiring payload or booster support from a 50
    SW unit.
50SWI10-1208 10 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   3


2. Responsibilities.
   2.1. The 50 SW Space Vehicle Operations Director (50 SW/SVOD) will be appointed from
   any 50 SW unit with SCA during a launch. The 50 SW/SVOD will be responsible for
   briefing the 50 SW/CC on the readiness of the 50 SW to support launch activities.
Note: The 50 SW/SVOD provides the leadership and management to successfully accomplish
Launch and Early Orbit (LEO) responsibilities.
3. Operational Readiness Review (ORR) for SCA, Payload, or Booster Launches.
   3.1. The purpose of the ORR is twofold. First, it informs the 50 SW/CC of the upcoming
   launch and the 50 SW’s role in the launch. Second, it certifies to the14th Air Force
   Commander (14 AF/CC) the 50 SW’s readiness for launch.
   3.2. Notification of an upcoming ORR is sent by 14 AF. This message specifies the date and
   time of the ORR and notifies the 50 SW of suspense(s). Upon receipt of this message, the
   appropriate 50 SW agency will begin preparations for the briefing. If a 50 OG Space
   Operations Squadron (SOPS) has primary responsibility for the launch, they are responsible
   for preparing the briefing, if not, 22 SOPS will be the lead agency.
   3.3. For launches that involve a payload where a 50 OG SOPS has SCA during LEO (e.g.,
   Global Positioning System (GPS) launches), the 50 SW/SVOD will be the lead for the ORR.
   The 50 SW/SVOD is responsible for developing the ORR. The ORR briefing will cover, as
   needed: an overview on the purpose of the mission, launch specifics, mission timelines,
   SOPS’ launch preparations (status of hardware, software, database, documentation,
   personnel), risk assessments involved, SOC freeze, 50 SW Network Control Center (50
   SW/NCC) and 21 SOPS/NCC communications links, secure/non-secure voice, backup
   communications, 50 Mission Support Group (50 MSG) support equipment status (power
   generation, air compressors, chillers, boilers, etc.), status of the Air Force Satellite Control
   Network (AFSCN), Go/No-Go criteria, status of 50 SW units’ readiness to support launch,
   applicable pre-launch test concerns, and any other information the 50 SW/SVOD deems
   necessary.
       3.3.1. The 50 SW/SVOD will be responsible for organizing a pre-brief of the ORR to
       inform the 50 SW/CC of the upcoming launch. Prior to the 50 SW/CC’s pre-brief, the 50
       SW/SVOD will be responsible for briefing the 50 OG/CC. The 50 SW/SVOD will
       prepare and submit the ORR slides to the 50 OG/CC prior to the 50 SW/CC’s pre-brief
       for approval. Mandatory attendance for the ORR pre-brief to the 50 SW/CC includes: 50
       OG/CC, 50 MSG/CC, 50 NOG/CC, 22 SOPS/CC, 50 SW Chief of Maintenance (COM)
       and 50 SW Safety (50 SW/SE) or designated representatives.
       3.3.2. In the case of a launch slip, the 50 SW/SVOD will re-accomplish the pre-brief as
       requested by the 50 SW/CC. If the launch is rescheduled, the 50 SW/SVOD will re-
       accomplish the pre-brief, unless otherwise directed by the 50 SW/CC.
4. Operations Requirement Letter (ORL).
   4.1. For any satellite launch, support activity and readiness must be communicated to the
   launch community via the ORL.
   4.2. NLT 25 days before launch (L-25), the 50 SW/SVOD will develop and disseminate the
   ORL to 50 SW units with primary responsibility for the launch. The letter will identify
4                                                        50SWI10-1208 10 SEPTEMBER 2009


    AFSCN requirements. As a minimum, it will include: a brief description of requirements to
    include date/window of the launch, Inter-Range Operations Number (IRON), mandatory and
    required AFSCN sites, security classification of launch activities to include references used
    to determine classification, the satellite/booster communication link description, specific
    Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) or the Remote Block Change (RBC) equipment
    configuration requirements, communication (primary/alternate) configuration, resource
    configuration requirements, technical control configuration requirements, S-Band track and
    record requirements, pre-launch testing requirements, date/time when the All Station
    Conference (ASC) will be held, and a description of data products required to support the
    launch.
5. 50 SW Units Other Activities and Responsibilities.
    5.1. 50 SW units supporting the launch are responsible for providing the 50 SW/SVOD with
    status of hardware, software (to include database installs), etc., Go/No-Go criteria and
    expected status at time of launch.
    5.2. The 50 SW/SVOD is responsible for ensuring the LNCS (see Attachments 7 and 8) is
    activated and operational.
       5.2.1. The 50 SW/SVOD will be responsible for submitting a Radiation restriction
       (RAD) schedule request during any/all launch activities.
    5.3. The 22 SOPS Network Crew Commander (NCMDR) is responsible for immediately
    notifying the 50 SW/SVOD of any changes to the AFSCN that may adversely affect the
    launch.
    5.4. Any changes to the 50 SW readiness or Go/No-Go status will be handled real-time by
    the 50 SW/SVOD and the information will be passed over the LNCS. The squadron
    commander with primary responsibility for launch support will advise the 50 SW/CC and
    group commanders of any changes.
    5.5. The 50 SW Go/No-Go status and required criteria will be developed by the 50 OG unit
    with primary responsibility for launch support (see Attachment 2). The information will be
    developed and coordinated with the 50 SW/SVOD. Attachment 2 will be coordinated
    through the 50 OG/CC, 50 NOG/CC, and 50 MSG/CC and approved by the 50 SW/CC at L-
    30 days prior to the scheduled launch. Go/No-Go criteria for individual satellite systems
    should not change for each launch, however, the criteria for launch activities may change
    based on unusual launch events.
    5.6. Go/No-Go criteria will address the following:
       5.6.1. Include information on the 50 SW/NCC and 21 SOPS/NCC equipment status,
       System Capability (SYSCAP), Operations Capability (OPSCAP), status of primary and
       secondary control centers (if applicable), and status on all data and communications links
       that would result in a No-Go for launch support.
       5.6.2. 22 SOPS will consider and report on the health of the AFSCN, i.e., status on all
       the RTS equipment that would result in a No-Go for launch. 22 SOPS must coordinate
       with 21 SOPS (as applicable) to ensure previously scheduled significant maintenance
       activities do not adversely impact the planned launch date. All launch and significant
       AFSCN maintenance conflicting activities must be resolved NLT L-10; otherwise, they
50SWI10-1208 10 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 5


      will be included in the Go/No-Go notice. Reason(s) will be provided on why conflicts
      cannot be resolved and recommendations will be made. 22 SOPS will ensure the RTS
      involved with launch activities has advised the host commander of anticipated
      requirements (resources).
      5.6.3. 50 SW units will include any on-orbit conditions, such as a major satellite
      anomaly, with the existing constellation that would result in a No-Go for launch support.
      5.6.4. Identify the impacts and the actions being taken to resolve any concerns or issues
      with supporting the launch. Go/No-Go criteria will also list ways to mitigate the risk and
      identify back-up plans.
      5.6.5. The 50 SW/SVOD will coordinate with 50 SW Safety Office on space safety and
      include it in the mission brief.
      5.6.6. Include any information that would result in a No-Go for launch support.
   5.7. 50 SW Chief of Maintenance (COM), 50 SCS/SCQ will provide current status of
   ground equipment and communications links supporting launch operations. 50 SW COM
   will provide maintenance action information as well as an Estimated Time Return to
   Operations (ETRO) for gound equipment or communications link outage situations that
   would impact launch operations.
6. Operational Directives (OD).
   6.1. NLT L-120 the 50 SW/SVOD will review the applicable OD. The 50 SW/SVOD will
   ensure 22 SOPS and supporting agencies have the current OD and provide any changes to the
   document NLT L-25. In addition, NLT L-l20 the 50 SW/SVOD will ensure the user has
   been assigned an IRON IAW 22 SOPS OI 10-1 (22 SOPS Inter-range Operation Number
   (IRON) Management. NLT L-120 22 SOPS will ensure they have an OD for new programs.
   22 SOPS will be responsible to ensure the RTS have an up-to-date OD and the vehicle folder
   has been created by the applicable RTS contractor to support the launch.
7. AFSCN Network Resource Loading.
   7.1. NLT L-21, the 50 SW/SVOD will submit to 22 SOPS the AFSCN Network Resource
   Loading letter to ensure all AFSCN required assets are added to the Automated Scheduling
   Tools for Range Operations Electronic Scheduling Dissemination (ASTRO/ESD).
   7.2. The 50 SW/SVOD will coordinate with the National Reconnaissance Office Operations
   Squadron (NOPS) on all AFSCN support requests to reduce scheduling conflicts.
   7.3. NLT L-5, the 50 SW/SVOD will schedule an ASC. Mandatory attendance: all 50 SW
   units supporting the launch activities. The 50 SW/SVOD is responsible for briefing all
   launch requirements to the participants. As applicable, the briefing will include: a valid and
   up-to-date OD, contents of the ORL, freeze documents available to the 50 SW units, search
   and acquisition procedures, review tape shipment and retention requirements, RTS database
   version and IRON configuration, review of any manual configuration changes, notification of
   test support requirements, review of any special requirements for the launch such as
   recordings, and a review of all contingency requirements such as launch slip information,
   contingencies and space safety planning. The 50 SW/SVOD will ensure the ASC appears in
   the 24-hour ESD.
6                                                        50SWI10-1208 10 SEPTEMBER 2009


    7.4. The 50 SW/SVOD will be responsible for immediately disseminating a Launch Slip
    Message (LSM) to all 50 SW units supporting launch activities and any changes to the
    launch date and time (outside the scheduled launch window). If the date or time changes, up
    to 14 days, a rewrite of the ORL and Freeze Letters is not required, however, a slip past 14
    days requires a complete rewrite of the ORL and Freeze Letters. The 50 SW/SVOD will state
    in the LSM that both the ORL and the Freeze Letters are not required since the slip is within
    the 14 day criteria.
    7.5. The 50 SW/SVOD will be responsible for obtaining launch range weather forecast and
    probabilities of constraint violations due to the weather.
    7.6. NLT L-30, the 50 SW/SVOD is responsible for coordinating with 22 SOPS on all
    significant scheduled AFSCN maintenance activities that will adversely impact launch
    activities, otherwise, a freeze will be required for AFSCN equipment.
    7.7. NLT L-30, the 50 SW/SE will coordinate the nomination of the Interim Safety Board
    (ISB) President, and provide the 50 SW/CC signed memo to the 50 SW/SVOD. The ISB
    President must be either the Squadron Commander or Director of Operations from an
    operations squadron (not from the launch responsible squadron), or a 50 OG/CD. The ISB
    President must be present during launch activities and must take the required training
    provided by the 50 SW Orbital Safety Office.
       7.7.1. IAW AFI 91-204, para 2.7.4.1, do not appoint personnel involved in the mishap to
       the ISB.
    7.8. The 50 SW/SVOD will test the unsecured LNCS (see Attachments 7 and 8 for
    procedures in using this system), conduct Pre-Launch and Early Orbit (LEO) testing with the
    spacecraft, verify the condition of the satellite and ensure the squadron can support the
    spacecraft. Ensure meetings are held during all phases of launch planning to exchange
    pertinent information, i.e. kickoff meeting, normally held by the squadron commander or
    his/her authorized representative. This type of meeting covers mission and flight number,
    time of launch, plane, slot, AFSCN status, manning, and any other topic which may affect the
    overall LEO process. Pre-Coordination Meeting – the lead planner and contractor Technical
    Advisors (TAs) hold informal pre-coordination meetings about one hour before Pass Plan
    Briefings (PPB), to ensure command plan packages are correct and ready for the PPB. The
    PPB is held every 24 hours to brief pass plans for a specified time period, discuss the status
    on the health of the AFSCN, etc.
Note: Tech Advisors (TAs) provide satellite expertise during launch operations. They generate
planning products in parallel with the launch squadron to verify accuracy and completeness. The
50 SW/SVOD will ensure rehearsals are conducted.
    7.9. NLT L-15, the 50 SW/SVOD will contact the 50 Space Communication
    Squadron/SCOK, Wing Knowledge Operations, to provide the NASA transponder channel
    the ability to view the launch, if possible. The 50 SW/SVOD will tie in the operations nets to
    the 50 SW Command Post and the affected SOC. This setup is used for monitoring purposes
    only, but if this setup interferes with real-time operations, the monitor nets will be dropped.
    7.10. The 50 SW/SVOD will be responsible for ensuring emergency checklists are current
    and readily available. The 50 SW/SVOD will be responsible for implementing appropriate
    emergency response procedures (i.e., bomb threat, fire, security, etc.) and overseeing
50SWI10-1208 10 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  7


   response actions during       launch     activities,   in   coordination   with   the   Mission
   Commander/Mission Chief.
   7.11. The 50 SW/SVOD will be responsible for ensuring anomaly checklists are readily
   available and ensure they are utilized during emergency situations, in coordination with the
   Situation Assessment and Recovery Team (SART).
   7.12. The 50 SW/SVOD will maintain an events log. The log is used to record events during
   launch and emergencies or mission critical events. The log is also used for reconstruction of
   events during an investigation. Crewmembers must attempt to keep as accurate a log as
   possible, but logging events does not take priority over an emergency.
8. Other Responsibilities and Activities.
   8.1. As applicable, all 50 SW units supporting launch activities must provide the 50
   SW/SVOD with:
       8.1.1. Satellite Information, which includes: mission overview, payload description
       (include mission life and design enhancements), launch date/time (to include window),
       final station, and early orbit timeline.
       8.1.2. Early Orbit Timeline, which includes: liftoff, SCA transfer, acquisitions,
       maneuvers, major spacecraft component deployment, start of on-orbit testing and payload
       initialization.
       8.1.3. Personnel Readiness, which includes: minimum personnel required for a launch,
       to include training/certification readiness of SOC personnel.
       8.1.4. Procedures which include: pre-launch testing, rehearsals, training, exercises, and
       pass plans, etc.
       8.1.5. The 50 SW/COM will provide status of Schriever AFB and AFSCN link status
       that are supporting launch operations to the 50 SW/SVOD and 22 SOPS. This includes
       Primary, Alternate, Internodal, and Voice links.
       8.1.6. All units (i.e. NOPS, 2 SOPS, etc.) will avoid (if possible) scheduling critical
       contacts within one hour of a scheduled launch window except for launch related
       contacts. This is a consideration that each unit will use in their internal scheduling
       process.
       8.1.7. The 50 OG/CC is responsible for determining the readiness of the 50 OG to
       support each launch mission. To facilitate the development of standard launch
       procedures within the 50 SW, the Chief of Standardization and Evaluation (50 OG/OGV)
       will appoint by letter a 50 OG/OGV member to be present in the SOPS to observe launch
       events.
       8.1.8. For any launch that requires AFSCN support for an external SOC, 22 SOPS will
       be responsible for developing and briefing the 50 SW’s portion of the ORR.
          8.1.8.1. The ORR briefing will cover, as needed: AFSCN mandatory/required sites
          of support, Remote Tracking Station (RTS) status, communication link status, any
          changes made to the AFSCN baseline since the previous AFSCN supported launch,

       may include predictive RFI, generating satellite visibilities, two line mean element sets
       (2LMES) data, support of early-orbit determination, and space object identification.
       8.1.11. NLT the last day of each month 50 SW units and external AFSCN customers
       requiring AFSCN launch support will send their 180-day forecasts to the 22 SOPS
       Mission Support Flight and the 22 SOPS Maintenance Officer (22 SOPS/MA).
       8.1.12. 22 SOPS will be responsible for providing the 50 SW/SVOD with launch
       readiness of 21, 22, 23 SOPS and/or AFSCN. 22 SOPS will provide required AFSCN
       status for the ORR message. 22 SOPS will coordinate with the launch responsible
       squadron on space safety issues, status on outages, OPSCAP, hardware, and software.

       documents and space safety requirements to include: Radio Frequency Interference
       predictions for early orbit satellite maneuvers and Electromagnetic Interference analysis.
9. Assets/Resources Launch Freezes.
    9.1. Launch freezes are applicable to all SCA, payload, or booster supported by the 50 SW.
    Assets/resources (configuration) freezes are imposed to minimize the risk to LEO activities
    and other periods of critical operations. Freezes include: Declaring and Requesting,
    Implementing and Waivers. There are three types of asset freezes: SOC, SAFB and
    AFSCN.
    9.2. Responsibilities - Freeze Assets (declaring and requesting).
       9.2.1. Once a unit determines which assets or resources will be either dedicated to the
       launch or deemed critical for mission success, the unit will declare a need for those assets
       and submit a request to freeze them to the 50 SW/SVOD. Assets can either be under the
       auspices and authority of the 50 OG/CC, 50 MSG/CC or 50 NOG/CC. All equipment
       must be Mission Capable; otherwise, the equipment is a candidate for No-Go. Note:
50SWI10-1208 10 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   9


       Disputes over mission priority (Mission Needs) will be forwarded immediately by the 50
       SW/SVOD to the 50 SW/CC for resolution. The decision of the 50 SW/CC shall be final
       and conclusive. Other cases of disputes, such as denial of waiver requests that cannot be
       resolved, will be forwarded through functional chains of command for resolution. All
       information concerning the dispute will be included.
       9.2.2. The 50 SW/SVOD will coordinate all freeze requests with all the units affected by
       the freeze. The freeze request(s) will be submitted to the 50 SW/CC, or designated
       representative, with concurrence from the 50 OG/CC, 50 NOG/CC and 50 MSG/CC,
       requesting approval or disapproval of the freeze request (only attachments 4 and 5 apply,
       attachment 3 is advisory). If the freeze is approved, only those assets/resources dedicated
       for the launch are frozen until critical operations have been completed. If disapproved on
       the basis of mission need, the freeze request will be sent back to the 50 SW/SVOD for
       rework (see note regarding disputes) and the process starts over again.
Note: When declaring a freeze, the freeze request is a candidate for Go/No-Go consideration if
the freeze is not granted.
   9.3. Implementation.
       9.3.1. SOC freeze goes into affect NLT 24 hours prior to the dress rehearsal and
       continues until all LEO or critical operations have been completed.
       9.3.2. SAFB freeze goes into affect NLT L-5 through completion of LEO activities and
       critical operations. However, mission needs dictate when the freeze will take effect.
       9.3.3. Freeze of AFSCN resources go into effect at L-48 hours in support of LEO
       activities. 22 SOPS/CC, or the authorized representative, will be responsible for
       reviewing scheduled activities at AFSCN locations and determine if activities have a
       possible impact on launch readiness or other critical operations.
       9.3.4. See Attachments 3, 4 and 5, sample Freeze Request letters for SOC, SAFB and
       AFSCN.
       9.3.5. The 50 SW/SVOD will send a representative to the De-conflict meeting (DM) and
       the Utilities Outage meeting(s) (UOM) to ensure any activities presented at the DM and
       UOM do not affect frozen assets. If so, the 50 SW/SVOD and the 50 NOG/CC or
       designated representative, in concert with the appropriate/affected systems expert(s), will
       be responsible for recommending said activities be rescheduled and advising the
       requester to submit a waiver request if frozen assets/activities cannot be rescheduled.
       9.3.6. The 50 SW/SVOD will ensure freeze messages are provided to the 22 SOPS
       Mission Support and 22 SOPS Maintenance Officer (22 SOPS/MA), as well as
       termination of frozen assets.
Note: The release of one freeze does not affect a freeze imposed by another agency for other
reasons.
   9.4. Freeze Waivers.
       9.4.1. Freeze waivers will be submitted to the 50 SW/SVOD before performing any
       upgrades or changes to the operations configuration of a frozen asset, prior to installation
       of an Engineering Change Proposal, Temporary Configuration Change, Form 19
10                                                    50SWI10-1208 10 SEPTEMBER 2009


     installation or Temporary Change Modification Waiver Request, etc. RTS will
     coordinate freeze wavier(s) with 22 SOPS before submitting the request to the 50
     SW/SVOD. Units requesting a waiver will conduct a thorough risk assessment of the
     activity requested and present the result to the 50 SW/SVOD. 50 SW units must ensure
     that whenever a freeze is imposed, it will not affect assets not under the operational
     control of the unit who initiated the freeze. As such, all waiver requests must be
     reviewed by the unit requesting the freeze to ensure that no action is taken that could
     directly impact current operations. Accomplish all freeze waiver requests as specified in
     the sample template in Attachment 6.
     9.4.2. Exceptions to a freeze include maintenance urgently needed to protect safety of
     equipment and personnel, activities such as training, Preventive Maintenance Inspections
     , Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) (unless the PDM activities change the normal
     operational configuration, or significantly impact operations as defined by the unit),
     performing launch vehicle updates required for launch, and performing corrective
     maintenance needed to restore operational capability of mission critical equipment. The
     unit commander will validate the urgency of need for maintenance activities during
     freeze periods. The 50 SW Chief of Maintenance (COM), will make a decision as to
     which activities are performed without a need for a waiver, which activites require a
     waiver and which activities can be delayed until after the freeze. In the event that it
     cannot be determined which activity has an impact on the operational mission, a waiver is
     required.
     9.4.3. Waiver approval will reside with the agency/unit(s) controlling the frozen asset(s).
     The 50 SW SVOD will route the approved waiver(s) to the 50 SW Chief of Maintenance
     (50 SCS/SCQ), 22 SOPS/CC, and 50 CES/CC for coordination or information. The 50
     NOG/CC is the final approval authority for freeze waivers.

Terms
Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN)—A global, inter-command configuration of
space vehicle command, control, and communications resources operating in concert to support
Department of Defense and other assigned space missions. Loss of a mandatory resource would
likely scrub a launch. Required Site-A loss of a required resource may be waived by the Satellite
Control Authority.
AFSCN-Freeze—Resources used by many organizations. The length of time these resources
remain frozen should be kept to a minimum. As with a base freeze, a general or detailed list (if
known) should be included with the request and the agencies that maintain operational control
over those assets ensures the proper equipment is put into a freeze condition. These assets may
be comprised of, but are not limited to: Remote Tracking Stations operated by 50 NOG
detachments, 22 SOPS, 23 SOPS, and the communications system required for launch, both at
the primary and the alternate node.
AFSCN Resource Schedule—Daily schedule of approved non-flight AFSCN activities.
Automated Scheduling Tool for Range Operations (ASTRO) Scheduling System—A
computer based scheduling system used by 22 SOPS to publish network tasking orders.
Base Freeze—Many of the assets considered under a base freeze may need to be frozen at
different times and for different lengths of time. When a base freeze is requested, a general or
detailed list of the resources that need to be frozen must be included in the memorandum
requesting the freeze. Agencies maintaining operational control of those assets are to determine
the exact resources needed for the launch and the time period necessary to freeze them. These
assets may be comprised of, but are not limited to: base communications systems used by the
launch program, base utilities (Power, HVAC, etc.), and activities that could have an impact on
operations. The freeze is applicable only to the location specified (i.e., a Schriever AFB freeze
does not automatically freeze 21 SOPS assests).
50SWI10-1208 10 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                      13


Corrective Maintenance—Corrective maintenance are performed on equipment that is in need
of immediate repair, or poses a safety or health hazard.
Critical Operations—All operations deemed critical to LEO of a satellite program, or
operations deemed critical to national security or national defense. Operations that are necessary
to stabilize the health of a satellite to prevent its loss, and/or a change in configuration that might
have serious consequences to current operations.
Deconfliction Meeting—Allows the operations community to review all proposed activities
prior to inclusion on the module resource schedule and the AFSCN resource schedule.
Coordinates and schedules access to modules for both interference and non-interference actions.
This meeting is the primary method for all users to obtain information concerning activities and
freeze schedules.
Dedicated System—A dedicated system that supports one specific space program.
Freeze—A hold put on all configuration changes to the specified system databases, hardware,
software, communications, ceiling/under-floor activities, and all base utilities required for
operations. This includes all work for Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), Temporary
Configuration Changes (TCC), Temporary Change Modification (TCM), and facility work.
Database files necessary for daily on-orbit operations (e.g., schedule records, Contact Support
Plans (CSP), Vehicle Ephemeris Identifications (VEID), etc.) are excluded. Corrective
maintenance to hardware or communications equipment that is critical to mission success is
considered exempt from the freeze waiver process.
Freeze Release—The removal of all restrictions imposed by a freeze. The date and time
(ZULU) of the freeze release shall be included with the letter/message that initiated the freeze
with the understanding that at any time prior to that date and time the freeze release can be
changed. The change of date and time can be done verbally, but requires a follow up
memorandum/message. If no change to the original date is received, then the freeze is
automatically released on that date.
Freeze Waiver—A memorandum or waiver request form developed by the requester allowing
changes to be performed on assets that are frozen. All waiver requests are considered on an
individual basis. Waivers must be coordinated with agencies/units controlling the frozen assets.
Mandatory RTS—Any RTS used to support a launch where a change in status affects “Go/No-
Go” launch criteria.
Module Resource Schedule—A daily schedule of approved non-flight module activity. All
activities that have the potential to impact mission hardware availability must be on the module
resource schedule.
Preventive Maintenance Inspection (PMI)—This is work that is normally performed at the
unit level and can include a wide range of activities. The unit performing a PMI should decide
which activities are performed without the need of a freeze waiver, which activities require a
waiver, and which activities should be delayed until after the freeze. In the event that it cannot
be determined if an activity has an impact on the operational mission, a waiver or Freeze
Response Letter is required. Note: A Free Response Letter is a memorandum to the launch
agency stating why a requested freeze cannot be placed on an asset.

Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM)—This work is considered above unit level
maintenance. This maintenance includes a wide range of activities and is performed by a Depot
Level Traveling Team. These activities do not include any configuration changes. When the
PDM is tasked to do an ECP, TCC, or TCM, a freeze waiver request or Freeze Response Letter
is required. Note: A Free Response Letter is a memorandum to the launch agency stating why a
requested freeze cannot be placed on an asset.
Required RTS—Any RTS used to support launches where a change in status does not affect
“Go/No-Go” launch criteria.
SOC—Includes all equipment maintained at the squadron level to include main system
computers, consoles, under floor, above roof, SVS (Internet), etc.
SOC Freeze—Freezes the SOC assets, including the primary node and any assets deemed
critical for mission success located at the backup nodes.
Space Vehicle Operations Director (50 SW/SVOD)—The 50 SW/SVOD provides leadership
and management to successfully accomplish Launch and Early Orbit operations. This involves
guiding and directing the activities of the squadron and contractor personnel, keeping the group
focused as a team and coordinating LEO activities with outside agencies. When a decision must
be made that affects operations planning or execution, the 50 SW/SVOD, contractors and crew
will convene as a team. The team gathers information, evaluates the situation and recommends a
course of action. The 50 SW/SVOD is responsible for providing input regarding the feasibility
of the squadron’s ability to support the recommended course of action. The information,
evaluation and recommendation are channeled by the 50 SW/SVOD through the chain of
command for approval then down to the crews for execution.
Utility Outage Meeting—A weekly meeting that allows the operations community to review all
proposed utility outages. Attendees agree on impact and how the community should handle the
outage prior to the activity being put on the Utility Outage Schedule.
Utility Outage Schedule—Daily schedule of approved utility outages.
50SWI10-1208 10 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   15

                    LAUNCH NETS CONFERENCING SYSTEM (LNCS)
A7.1. Purpose.
     A7.1.1. The LNCS is used to conduct launch support activities.
A7.2. Security.
     A7.2.1. The LNCS is an unclassified system. This system utilizes push-to-talk handsets to
     reduce background noise from entering the system. It is the responsibility of each user of
     this system to use it at the unclassified level.
A7.3. System Initialization.
     A7.3.1. The LNCS consists of five nets with five listening devices. The system is
     activated by the launch agency or by facility personnel. Once activated, the nets come up in
     the listen (monitor) mode. When the system is activated, all LNCS speakers located
     throughout the SOCs will automatically begin receiving communications. The speakers can
     be turned off by turning the volume control wheel off. If 2-way voice connectivity is
     required, follow the steps in para 7.4 (steps 7.4.1 through 7.4.4). Note: Only the SOC(s)
     having an active part in launch activities are authorized to establish 2-way voice connectivity,
     all others can listen to launch activities.
A7.4. Accessing Various Nets to Enable 2-way Voice Connectivity.
     A7.4.1. Remove the handset from the cradle.
     A7.4.2. Listen for a dial tone.
     A7.4.3. Press the line button associated with the net required to speak.
     A7.4.4. By pressing the “#” key, the conference net is established. The connectivity
     allows two-way conversation.
Note: If 2-way voice connectivity is needed with any of the other nets, place the net you
established on hold and follow the steps in para 7.4. (steps 7.4.1 through 7.4.4).
A7.5. Manual Activation If Unable to Establish Voice Connectivity as Outline In Para 7.4.
     A7.5.1. Remove the handset from the cradle.
     A7.5.2. Listen for a dial tone.
     A7.5.3. Dial: DSN 560-1190 or commercial (719) 567-1190.
     A7.5.4. Listen for the “Welcome” announcement.
     A7.5.5. Dial the desired net number in Attachment 8.
     A7.5.6. Press the “#” key. You are now connected to the net and have the ability to talk.
        A7.5.6.1. Examples: to access Net 1. Dial DSN 560-1190 or commercial (719) 567-
        1190, enter 22731#.
        A7.5.6.2. To access Net 5: Dial DSN 560-1190 or commercial (719) 567-1190, enter
        22735#.
50SWI10-1208 10 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 25


A7.6. Accessing a Net by AFSCN External Users.
   A7.6.1. Remove the handset from the cradle.
   A7.6.2. Listen for a dial tone.
   A7.6.3. Dial: DSN 560-1190 or commercial (719) 567-1190.
   A7.6.4. Listen for the “Welcome” announcement.
   A7.6.5. Dial the desired net number in Attachment 8, figure A8. 1.
   A7.6.6. Press the “#” key. You are now connected to net and have the ability to talk.
A7.7. Releasing the Launch Nets (Disconnecting 2-way Voice Connectivity). Once the
launch is completed and the nets are no longer needed, the launch agency or facility personnel
will initiate the required procedures to ensure the nets are taken down. Note: Personnel who are
just listening to any of the launch nets take no action, however, those that established the 2-way
connectivity must release the nets, failure to do so will hang-up the system.
   A7.7.1. Remove the handset from the cradle.
   A7.7.2. Press the line button associated with the conference with which you are established.
   A7.7.3. Press the “RLS” (release) key on the telephone.
   A7.7.4. Repeat steps 7. 7.1 thru 7.7.3 for each conference you established 2-way voice
   communications.
   A7.7.5. Hang up the hand set.
A7.8. LNCS Trouble Reporting.
   A7.8.1. Contact the Schriever AFB Maintenance Control to report any outages or problems
   with the LNCS at DSN 560-2666, or commercial (719) 567-2666 (non-secure line). The
   back-up number is DSN 560-6957, or commercial (719) 567-6957 (secure line).
