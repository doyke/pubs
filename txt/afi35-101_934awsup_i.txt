                      GENERAL GUIDELINES AND BACKGROUND

Section 1A—Principles and Core Competencies

1.1. Purpose. This directive conveys the policies which allow commanders and Public
Affairs professionals to deliver truthful, credible, accurate and timely information to key
audiences in order to enhance their understanding and appreciation for Air Force capabilities
and contributions to national security, while maintaining due regard for privacy and
communication security. It describes Air Force Public Affairs, explains how the function is
organized and how the program should be conducted at all levels of command. It provides
Public Affairs policy and guidelines for all Air Force military and civilian personnel, including
those in the Air National Guard and U.S. Air Force Reserve.
1.2. Implementing Authority. Statutory authority for this instruction is derived from Title
10, United States Code, Subtitle D, Part 1, Chapter 803, Sec. 8013 and 8014, Office of the
Secretary of the Air Force. Other authorities include Title 5, United States Code, Section 552;
DODD 5120.20, Armed Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS); DODD 5400.13, Joint
Public Affairs Operations; DODD 5410.18, Public Affairs Community Relations Policy; DOD
Instruction 5410.19, Public Affairs Community Relations Policy Implementation; DODD
5400.7, DOD Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program; DODI5400.10, OSD
Implementation of DOD “Freedom of Information Act” (FOIA) Program; DODD 5400.11, DOD

Civilian Enterprise Publications; DODD 8910.1, Management and Control of Information
Requirements; and Joint Publication 3-61, Doctrine for Public Affairs in Joint Operations.
1.3. Application. The guidance in this publication is authoritative and should be followed
except when, in the judgment of the commander, exceptional circumstances dictate otherwise.
Public Affairs is a command responsibility at all levels. These instructions are applicable under
the purview of Air Force guidelines. However, in joint and combined operations, this
instruction will be superseded. If conflicts arise between the content of this publication and
those of Department of Defense Public Affairs directives, the DOD directives take precedence
for the activities of joint forces unless the Secretary of Defense or the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff has provided more current and specific guidance.
1.4. Missions.
     1.4.1. Public Affairs Mission. Provide strategic counsel, operational planning, and tactical
     execution of communication as a function of the Air Force mission, joint combat operations,
     and national security objectives.

AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                               23


   1.4.3. Broadcasting Mission. Support Air Force strategic communication objectives by
   producing high-quality products and programming services that are informative and
   entertaining for audiences worldwide.
1.5. Goals. Public Affairs has established three strategic priorities to achieve its mission. They
are:
   1.5.1. Develop strategic communication leaders.
   1.5.2. Get the right technology and processes to our Public Affairs warfighters.
   1.5.3. Integrate Public Affairs operations with combat capabilities.
1.6. Purpose of Public Affairs.
   1.6.1. The U.S. Air Force engages in Public Affairs to provide trusted counsel to leaders;
   build, maintain, and strengthen Airman morale and readiness; enhance public trust and
   support; and achieve global influence and deterrence.
   1.6.2. The Air Force‟s credibility depends on two factors: always maintaining professional
   integrity and communicating timely, truthful information to the public. Public Affairs seeks
   to inform decision makers and communicate the service‟s requirements, capabilities,
   actions and achievements to the world. Success ultimately depends on the credibility of Air
   Force people and their willingness to join in the public discussion.
   1.6.3. The triad of Public Affairs practitioners, bandsmen, and broadcasters is dedicated to
   executing the Public Affairs mission for the Air Force. The triad uses its resources to
   research, plan, execute, and evaluate communication strategies and tactics.
   1.6.4. It is the responsibility of all Airmen to tell the Air Force story. Whether they‟re
   representing their base at a community function or representing the U.S. in a wartime or
   contingency operation, all Airmen are front-line ambassadors for the Air Force. It is
   imperative for the Public Affairs triad to prepare all Airmen to be credible, intelligent, and
   articulate spokespersons for the Air Force.
1.7. Principles. The Air Force has established standards for how we conduct ourselves and the
way we do our jobs.
   1.7.1. Air Force Core Values:
       1.7.1.1. Integrity First. Integrity is doing what is right even when no one is looking.
       Integrity takes courage, honesty, responsibility, accountability, justice, openness, self-
       respect, humility, and is the foundation of credibility. Integrity is vital in dealing with the
       Public Affairs core audiences consisting of Airmen, the news media, Congress, and the
       public.
       1.7.1.2. Service Before Self. Service before self is a direct link to the principle that
       people in the Public Affairs triad must always maintain professional ethics and
       integrity. Service before self means professional duties take precedence over personal
       desires.
       1.7.1.3. Excellence In All We Do. The Public Affairs triad must make its first
       tradition excellence. Excellence in all we do directs us to develop a sustained passion
       for continuous improvement in the Profession of Arms. The discipline to research,
24                                              AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


        plan execute and evaluate communication strategies and tactics is critical to Airmen
        being able to tell the Air Force story.
1.8. Public Affairs Core Competencies. The five Public Affairs core competencies are
directly linked to the Air Force Core Competencies. The core competencies provide the
Public Affairs triad with the vision to integrate information into operations at home and in an
expeditionary role. The core competencies are supported by five key processes and process
improvements constituting the way the Air Force conducts Public Affairs.
     1.8.1. Trusted Counsel to Leaders. Public Affairs delivers candid and timely counsel and
     guidance to commanders on decisions that affect the Air Force‟s ability to accomplish its
     mission. This professional advice enables leaders to accurately forecast the ramifications of
     their actions and their impact on public opinion.
        1.8.1.1. Public Affairs professionals identify and analyze key issues, develop messages,
        conduct media training, target specific audiences, ensure legally mandated public
        involvement requirements are met, recommend methods of delivery, and measure and
        evaluate results. This process enables commanders--in peace and war-- to provide
        factual information so the Air Force family, Congress, media, and the public may assess
        and understand how our people and programs contribute to national security.
     1.8.2. Airman Morale and Readiness. Airman morale and readiness is the foundation of all
     Air Force core competencies. Public Affairs provides leaders with an arsenal of effective and
     efficient two-way communication tools to build, maintain, and strengthen morale and
     readiness.
        1.8.2.1. The Air Force‟s most valuable resource is its Airmen -- active-duty and
        retired; Guard and Reserve; officer, enlisted and civilian; government service and
        contract employees — and their families. Their dedication and expertise translate the
        capabilities of hardware into mission readiness. Public Affairs programs help our
        Airmen understand their roles in the mission; explain how policies, programs and
        operations affect them and their families; provide avenues for feedback; and recognize
        individual and team achievements.
        1.8.2.2. Global engagement demands flexible, responsive Public Affairs capabilities to
        deploy time-sensitive information anywhere in the world within hours. Public Affairs
        professionals are trained and equipped to support Air Force, joint and combined
        operations from the home base to the bare base. Timely, relevant and accurate
        information is a force multiplier that enhances Airman morale and readiness.
     1.8.3. Public Trust and Support. Public trust and support are fundamental to a highly
     trained and well-equipped air and space force.
        1.8.3.1. Public Affairs strengthens the bonds between the Air Force and the public
        through open, timely and honest dialogue and programs targeted to communities, opinion
        leaders and the media. The American public provides the people who join our Air Force,
        the funds that ensure readiness and quality of life, and the support needed to conduct
        operations and training. Public Affairs professionals assist leaders in developing
        messages, identifying audiences and selecting methods of delivery to promote public
        understanding and support of the Air Force.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         25


       1.8.3.2. Public Affairs builds trust and support by showcasing the Air Force as a
       community partner and a responsible steward of public resources. Community outreach
       provides Americans firsthand opportunities to view the quality and capability of our
       people and weapon systems. Public Affairs initiatives and professional relationships
       with opinion leaders and the media convey Air Force core competencies to a broader
       audience.
   1.8.4. Global Influence and Deterrence. Public Affairs develops and implements
   communication strategies targeted toward informing national and international audiences
   about air and space power‟s impact on global events. The reaction of world leaders to media
   reports and public opinion, especially during contingencies and crises, demonstrates how
   media coverage can influence military operations.
       1.8.4.1. Telling the Air Force story is a force multiplier that creates virtual force
       projection and presence around the world. Public Affairs campaigns communicate the
       Air Force‟s air and space superiority and capabilities of global attack and rapid global
       mobility. Educating international audiences about Air Force core competencies deters
       potential adversaries. Public Affairs professionals prepare Airmen for global operations,
       developing them into frontline ambassadors.
       1.8.4.2. Through global influence and deterrence, Public Affairs helps Air Force
       leaders implement the national strategy of worldwide engagement and enlargement of
       democratic ideals.
   1.8.5. Public Affairs Readiness. Public Affairs must ensure the readiness of its band,
   broadcasting, and Public Affairs professionals. Maintaining and developing readiness
   allows Public Affairs to effectively execute its other four core competencies.
       1.8.5.1. Developing and maintaining a deployable Public Affairs combat force is
       essential to mission accomplishment. Public Affairs does this by developing and
       implementing doctrine, policy, and guidance for the career field. Also key in Public
       Affairs readiness is sustaining professional development to ensure career advancement,
       recognition, feedback, and effective leadership.
1.9. Public Affairs Core Processes. The Public Affairs Core Competencies are supported by
five core processes to assist the Public Affairs triad in conducting programs tailored for an
Expeditionary Public Affairs force. The core processes are identified below.
   1.9.1. Provide expert advice to assist leaders in making and communicating decisions that
   affect the Air Force‟s ability to accomplish its mission.
   1.9.2. Employ communication tools to link Airmen and their leaders, educate and inform,
   and recognize excellence.
   1.9.3. Ensure readiness of Public Affairs professionals.
   1.9.4. Promote public understanding and support by linking the Air Force to communities,
   opinion leaders, and the news media.
   1.9.5. Inform audiences worldwide about global air and space capabilities.
1.10. Public Affairs Principles. The principles of the Air Force Public Affairs program are
based on the following foundations that support the principles of the entire Air Force:
26                                              AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


     1.10.1. Leadership. Leadership is doing the right thing for our people in the Public Affairs
     triad, our Air Force, and our nation. We are committed to caring for our people and
     providing the policy, resources, training, recognition, and support they need. We also
     provide counsel so the organization will do what is right, and can be understood and
     supported by Air Force people and the public.
     1.10.2. Credibility. Credibility is our most important asset. It is built over time on a
     foundation of institutional behavior based on truth, integrity, and accountability. We
     cannot communicate effectively without it.
     1.10.3. Loyalty. We are committed to serving our nation, our Air Force, and our people.
     With loyalty comes the discipline to act from a sense of duty.
     1.10.4. Professionalism. Professionalism encompasses the expertise, quality, and attitude
     our customers expect and deserve. When we perform our jobs to the best of our ability and
     master our profession‟s core competencies, we demonstrate the professionalism necessary
     to successfully meet the needs of our customers.
     1.10.5. Vision. Vision determines our direction and focuses us on the future. 1t moves us
     beyond the priorities, practices and products of today, and allows us to anticipate, plan and
     position for tomorrow.
1.11. Information Operations (IO). 0nce we understand what our core competencies and
principles are, we move on to think about how we fit into the operational environment. The
Air Force has recognized the complexity of the modern battle-space in recent years by
articulating and defining operations in the information environment. The Air Force describes
information operations as the integrated employment of a wide range of capabilities and
enablers to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp adversarial human and automated decision
making while protecting our own. Just as air operations added another dimension to the
battlefield, information and information systems have brought about a revolution in military
operations. Evolving joint and Air Force doctrine and tactics help explain this dimension of
military operations. 1n Air Force doctrine, Public Affairs is considered a core capability of 10.
1t is essential that PA practitioners how to integrate, coordinate, and deconflict PA activities
with other 10 capabilities and understand what PA does and does not bring to the fight.

Section 1B—Public Affairs Programs

1.12. Air Force Public Affairs Programs. The Air Force conducts comprehensive, active
Public Affairs programs at all levels of command to provide servicemembers, the public,
Congress, and media representatives timely, accurate and authoritative Department of Defense
and Air Force information contributing to awareness and understanding of the Air Force‟s
mission. This is accomplished through the resources of the Public Affairs triad consisting of
Public Affairs practitioners, bandsmen, and broadcasters.
     1.12.1. To maintain credibility of internal and external communication, it is Air Force
     policy that a free flow of general, D0D, Department of the Air Force, command and unit
     information be made available to commanders at all levels in a timely, responsive manner,
     consistent with security, without censorship or propaganda. Disinformation, or activities to
     misinform, mislead, cover up or deny otherwise releasable information will not be practiced
     in any Public Affairs program.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           27


       1.12.1.1. Air Force policy is all Public Affairs programs will be designed for the
       purpose of increasing the awareness and understanding of all Americans concerning:
          1.12.1.1.1. Threats to the United States and its interests and the need for an Air Force
          capable of deterring, responding and prevailing against those threats.
          1.12.1.1.2. The relationship of the Air Force to the other armed services of the
          United States and its allies.
          1.12.1.1.3. The day-to-day activities of the Air Force and its capabilities as an
          instrument of national policy.
          1.12.1.1.4. The need for continual research, development and modernization of air
          and space systems.

          service in the U.S. Air Force.
          1.12.1.1.6. The essential and unique capabilities of air and space power and the Air
          Force‟s role in providing for America‟s national defense.
1.13. Public Affairs Activities. Traditionally, Public Affairs activities fall into four
categories: media operations, internal information, community relations, and security and
policy review. While these general categories account for most Public Affairs activities, they
do not necessarily dictate an organization for Public Affairs staffs. Instead, Air Force Public
Affairs must organize in a way to coordinate these programs to achieve synergistic effects.
Media Operations, Internal Information, and Community Relations programs focus
complementary messages on the same issues at the same time in the most effective mix.
   1.13.1. Media Operations. Ensures a free flow of information through the news media to the
   general public. Achieves informed public support for the Air Force mission. Responds to
   inquiries by the news media. Brings Air Force issues to the public agenda.

   their families. Achieves informed internal support for the Air Force mission. Responds to
   inquiries by Air Force members and their families. Maintains the morale, readiness,
   productivity and retention typical of a well-informed work force.
   1.13.3. Community Relations. Creates mutual acceptance, respect, appreciation and
   cooperation between the Air Force and the community.                   Maintains two-way
   communication between Air Force people and the communities they live in. Assists Air
   Force recruiting efforts. Responds to requests for Air Force participation in public events.
   Manages environmental Public Affairs issues and events. Promotes coordination,
   cooperation and mutual understanding among DOD components; other federal, state, and
   local agencies; and the civilian community. Ensures legal mandates of community
   involvement are met.
   1.13.4. Security and Policy Review. Ensures Americans receive maximum information
   concerning Air Force operations without delay. Ensures information publicly released does
   not adversely affect the national security. Ensures information released does not threaten the
   safety, security or privacy of Air Force personnel. Ensures information released to the
   public is consistent with established DOD and Air Force policies. Ensures information is
   not withheld merely because it casts criticism on or causes embarrassment to the Air Force.

1.14. Department of Defense Principles of 1nformation. It is the policy of the Department of
Defense to make available timely and accurate information so that the public, Congress and the
news media may assess and understand the facts about national security and defense strategy.
Requests for information from organizations and private citizens shall be answered in a timely
manner. In carrying out this policy, the following principles apply:
     1.14.1. Information will be made fully and readily available, consistent with statutory and
     regulatory requirements and exemptions. The provisions of the Freedom of Information Act
     and the Privacy Act will be supported in both letter and spirit.

     from criticism or embarrassment.
     1.14.4. Information will be withheld from disclosure only when authorized by applicable
     statute or instruction. Some examples of withholding information from disclosure would
     be when its release would be precluded by current and valid classification, would
     adversely affect national security or threaten the safety, or privacy of the men and women of
     the armed forces.
     1.14.5. The Air Force‟s obligation to provide the public with information on its major
     programs may require detailed Public Affairs planning and coordination within the
     Department of Defense and with other government agencies. The sole purpose of such an
     activity is to expedite the flow of information to the public. Propaganda has no place in
     DOD Public Affairs programs.

     deny releasable information to the American public. Deception operations will not
     intentionally target or mislead the U.S. public, the U.S. Congress, or the U.S. news media.
     Misinforming the U.S. media about military capabilities and intentions in ways that
     influence U.S. decision-makers and public opinion is contrary to DOD policy.
     1.15.2. The Gillette Amendment. The Deficiency Appropriation Act of 1913, now Title 5,
     Section 3107 of the United States Code, Sec. 3107, Employment of Publicity Experts;
     restrictions states: “Appropriated funds may not be used to pay a publicity expert unless
     specifically appropriated for that purpose.”
     1.15.3. Lobbying with Appropriated Monies. Title 18, Section 1913. No part of the money
     appropriated by any enactment of Congress shall, in the absence of express authorization by
     Congress, be used directly or indirectly to pay for any personal service, advertisement,
     telegram, telephone, letter, printed or written matter, or other device, intended or designed
     to influence in any manner a member of Congress, to favor or oppose, by vote or otherwise,
     any legislation or appropriation by Congress.

Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Serves as spokesperson for Army and Air National
Guard matters at the national level and develops Public Affairs programs and guidance for use
by National Guard organizations. Maintains liaison with Air Force, Army, and DOD Public
Affairs.

2.5. Public Affairs Division, Office of Air Force Reserve. Develops programs to meet the
Public Affairs needs of the chief of Air Force Reserve. Advises and counsels the chief of Air
Force Reserve on issues of Public Affairs impact. Administers the media program for the
Chief and Deputy Chief of Air Force Reserve and supports national media operations for all
Air Force Reserve policy issues. Provides editorial support for the chief of Air Force Reserve,
deputy, and the chief of Air Force Reserve and staff. Publishes communication products.
Provides security review of material related to the Reserve.
2.6. Major Commands, Field Operating Agencies, and Direct Reporting Units. Conduct
comprehensive, active Public Affairs programs at MAJCOM level to provide
servicemembers, the public, and media representatives timely, accurate and authoritative
Department of Defense and Air Force information contributing to awareness and understanding
of the MAJCOM‟s mission. Typically, duties include internal information, media operations,
community relations, security review, and plans and resources.
2.7. Premier and Geographically-Assigned Regional Bands. Air Force premier and
regional bands support the global Air Force mission in war and peace by fostering national
heritage and providing professional musical products and services for official military, recruiting
and community relations events.
2.8. Numbered Air Forces (NAF)/Component Air Forces. NAF Public Affairs positions
serve first as Public Affairs war planners supporting theater operations plans. NAF/PAs ensure
Combatant Commanders, Joint Task Force commanders, and Joint Forces Air Component
commanders have identified requirements for their supporting commands. The staff should
be of sufficient grade and size to act as the JFACC‟s core Public Affairs support when the
NAF deploys.
2.9. Wing and Lower-Level Office of Public Affairs. Personnel staffing does not always
permit separation of Public Affairs functions, particularly at wing level or below. Any workable
organization structure is permissible, providing it meets the Public Affairs requirements of
the organization. Typically, management, internal information, media operations, community
relations, and security review activities are performed, with some overlap in those missions.
Public Affairs offices that have host unit responsibility must provide support and guidance to
tenant and subordinate organizations according to local support agreements. Public Affairs
normally reports to the host wing commander on an installation.
2.10. Public Affairs Functional Responsibilities. The DOD Public Affairs program provides
the American people maximum information about the Defense Department, consistent with
national security, and contributes to good relations between DOD and all segments of the public
at home and abroad. In overseas areas, these activities are carried out with the Department of
State and the United States Information Agency (USIA).
2.11. Commanders’ Public Affairs Responsibilities. Commanders are the primary
spokespersons for their unit. As the Air Force mission becomes more complex and as the Air
Force and Public Affairs grow smaller, commanders face an increasingly difficult task to
explain the significance of Air Force requirements, actions, capabilities, and achievements.
Effective communication has a direct impact on mission effectiveness, morale, and retention. It
also makes Air Force people more effective representatives of the service. Externally, command
support can significantly increase public understanding of the Air Force‟s role in the national
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           33


defense and the resources needed by the Air Force to provide for that defense. Air Force
commanders have the following responsibilities:
   2.11.1. Conduct the Public Affairs program, with duties delegated to the Public Affairs
   officer.
   2.11.2. Make Air Force people aware of the mission, inform them about the Air Force,
   and make them aware of the importance of their role in meeting unit objectives.
   2.11.3. Instill discipline and foster pride in all Airmen.
   2.11.4. Ensure legally required community involvement in environmental issues is
   conducted in a thorough and timely manner.
   2.11.5. When there is no authorized manpower position, select as a unit Public Affairs
   representative (UPAR) the individual most qualified, by Air Force knowledge, experience,
   aptitude, and interest.
   2.11.6. Ensure Public Affairs officers are not given extra duties such as protocol, historian,
   or special event project officer, that would interfere with assigned Public Affairs duties
   since Public Affairs responsibilities often require immediate response to fast-breaking
   events.
   2.11.7. Advise the Public Affairs office of any incident or situation that could cause adverse
   or unfavorable media coverage or community reaction. Public Affairs officers must have
   complete information on incidents or situations to provide prompt communication counsel.
   2.11.8. Provide necessary support and facilities for tenant organizations, including
   Reserve and National Guard forces, to conduct Public Affairs activities. In addition,
   commanders should ensure host-tenant agreements describe Public Affairs procedures
   consistent with the responsibilities of the host command. Tenant organization Public Affairs
   activities must be coordinated with the host Public Affairs officer to prevent duplication or
   conflict, and to permit the host Public Affairs office to provide adequate support.
2.12. Subordinate Unit Commander Responsibilities. Subordinate unit commanders,
down to and including squadrons and similar organizations, conduct Public Affairs activities
according to procedures set by their commanders. Each unit commander will appoint a Public
Affairs representative.
2.13. Public Affairs Officer Responsibilities. The Public Affairs officer is a member of
the commander‟s personal staff. This provides direct access to the commander — a necessity if
the Public Affairs officer is to carry out assigned duties successfully.
   2.13.1. As a staff member, the Public Affairs officer advises the commander and other staff
   officers on Public Affairs matters. This requires a broad knowledge of Air Force operations
   and the ability to foresee the impact proposed command and staff actions will have on
   internal and external publics. It is essential Public Affairs officers be apprised of plans and
   operations from conception.
   2.13.2. The Public Affairs officer or qualified unit Public Affairs representative must be
   available 24 hours a day. This availability may be provided through command post channels
   or enhanced by use of a pager or cellular phone during non-duty hours.
34                                              AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


     2.13.3. In carrying out commander assigned responsibilities, the Public Affairs officer serves
     as staff counsel on Public Affairs matters and organizes, directs, and operates the Public
     Affairs program. This includes providing information to Air Force people, providing
     information about the Air Force to the public, ensuring positive relations between the Air
     Force and local communities and providing security review of text and imagery proposed
     for public release.
     2.13.4. Public Affairs officers should use the communications process of “research,
     planning, execution, and evaluation” in all Public Affairs programs. (See Chapter 4,
     Communication Planning)
     2.13.5. Public Affairs officers at all levels are authorized to communicate with each other
     and with other military organizations at any level for coordination or mutual assistance. If
     priority direct communication is required, Public Affairs officers should ensure all
     appropriate intermediate headquarters are briefed after the fact. Direct communication must
     not interfere with the responsibility and authority of commanders.
     2.13.6. Public Affairs comprises an extensive infrastructure throughout the Air Force and
     functions as an efficient communications network, addressing the same issues to all
     publics.      However, command-unique circumstances often result in different
     communications priorities, and competition can develop between Air Force, major
     command, and unit messages. In all cases, Public Affairs officers must support their
     immediate commanders first. Public Affairs officers must be both responsible to
     commanders and to higher headquarters‟ Public Affairs priorities. Air Force communication
     needs are best served when Public Affairs speaks with one voice at all levels.
2.14. Responsibilities of Air Force Members and Employees. Each Air Force member or
employee of the Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve has a personal
responsibility for the success of the Air Force Public Affairs program. As representatives of the
service in both official and unofficial contact with the public, such personnel have many
opportunities to contribute to positive public opinions toward the Air Force. Therefore, each
person must strive to make sure these contacts show the highest standards of conduct and
reflect the Air Force‟s core values of “integrity first; service before self; and excellence in all
we do.”
     2.14.1. Specifically, each Air Force member or employee is responsible for obtaining the
     necessary review and clearance, starting with Public Affairs, before releasing any proposed
     statement, text or imagery to the public. This includes any digital products being loaded on
     an unrestricted Web site.
     2.14.2. Air Force members and employees are responsible for ensuring the
     information to be revealed, whether official or unofficial, is appropriate for release
     according to classification requirements in DODD 5200.1 and AFPD 31-4, Information
     Security.
2.15. Prohibitions. Active-duty personnel and civilian employees must not:
     2.15.1. Use their Air Force association, official title or position to promote, endorse, or
     benefit any profit-making group or agency. This includes appearing in or preparing
     statements for inclusion in advertisements designed for use by electronic or print media.
     This does not prohibit Air Force members from assuming character or modeling roles in
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           35


   commercial advertisements during their non-duty hours. They may not, however, wear
   their uniform or allow their Air Force titles or positions to be affixed to the advertisement
   in any manner, or imply Air Force endorsement of the product or service being promoted.
   2.15.2. Make any commitment to provide official Air Force information to any non-DOD
   member or agency, including news media, prior to obtaining approval through command or
   Public Affairs channels.
   2.15.3. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve members also must in no way cast
   discredit on the Air Force or DOD, nor imply, with or without the intent to mislead, or give
   the appearance of sponsorship, sanction, or endorsement of the Air Force or DOD.
2.16. Host Unit Responsibilities. In collocated situations, if two or more Air Force commands
or activities are in a community, the senior installation commander establishes operating
instructions for coordinating local and regional Public Affairs activities of mutual interest.
   2.16.1. If an installation houses a MAJCOM headquarters, a NAF or equivalent headquarters,
   or both, the commander of the host command operates the base Public Affairs function. If
   desired, the commander may delegate authority for representing the installation or other
   command to another headquarters.
   2.16.2. At wing or group level, the Public Affairs function is assigned to the commander‟s
   staff in a single wing or group activity, and to the host commander‟s staff in an installation
   with more than one wing or group.
   2.16.3. Host unit Public Affairs officers should conduct regular training sessions for tenant
   and subordinate organizations, and provide guidance on Commander‟s Call procedures,
   hometown news release preparation and processing, news writing style, and simple
   interview procedures.
2.17. Air Force Responsibilities Related to DOD Public Affairs. The DOD Public Affairs
program provides the American people maximum information about the Department, as
consistent with national security, and contributes to good relations between DOD and all
segments of the public, at home and abroad. In overseas areas, these activities are carried out in
coordination with the theater commander and the Department of State.
   2.17.1. Within DOD, combat forces of the United States are organized into combatant
   commands. Strategic direction and operational control of these units flow from the President
   through the Secretary of Defense, to the commanders of each of the combatant commands.
   2.17.2. Air Force units stationed within a combatant command are subject to command and
   control of the unified commander and OASD/PA.
   2.17.3. Overseas, each U.S. embassy has a country team composed of representatives of the
   Defense Attaché Office, State Department Public Affairs office, and, where large numbers
   of U.S. forces are present, a senior U.S. military representative. This team oversees Public
   Affairs programs and activities within the country to ensure support of established country
   plan objectives. Local Public Affairs activities support the country plan.
   2.17.4. OASD/PA provides general guidance when specific Public Affairs guidance is not
   available. Air Force units tasked to provide or support combat forces of the United States
   are part of the DOD Public Affairs system. It is imperative Public Affairs personnel
   support DOD policy to expedite the flow of information to the public.

                                              Chapter 3

                                  RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

3.1. Purpose. The Public Affairs triad must have money, equipment, manpower and training
to effectively support the Air Force mission.
3.2. Budget. Public Affairs must play an active role in advocating for funding in execution and
financial plan years, and share information in the formulation of future years. Skills involve
monitoring execution-year expenditures, financial planning for known requirements in the next
fiscal year, and projecting requirements for the future years. For execution year, funding
allocation is compared against the financial plan and known changes. Identify unfunded
requirements to your FM budget analyst to be included during Initial Distribution
(October/December time frame) and Budget Execution Reviews (normally twice a year,
January/February time frame and June/July time frame). It is important to identify any
anticipated shortfall in these budget drills. In July, the comptroller will issue a call for end-of-year
spend plans, which form the priority listing used by wing commanders and MAJCOM
commanders, if end-of-year funding becomes available. This is an excellent opportunity for
Public Affairs to reset supplies and equipment items. During the financial plan exercise,
research expected changes in Public Affairs programs, cost out those changes, annotate them in
the financial plan, and justify your projections. Both peacetime and wartime requirements must
be met. The local logistics plans office can identify forward-area wartime taskings and
associated equipment requirements, which need to be included in the financial plan. Wartime
requirements of the organization must be met as the highest priority.
     3.2.1. Planning. All Public Affairs activities, including community involvement, must be
     submitted in the financial plan and included in future-year planning, the program
     objective memorandum (POM). Check with your unit or MAJCOM Plans and Programs
     office for local procedures. Remember to include any new activities and annual cost
     increases due to inflation in the submissions.
     3.2.2. Environmental Funds. An exception to normal funding control will occur as related to
     strategic and tactical planning of environmental issues and community involvement
     support. Environmental funds are funneled through the civil engineer/environmental
     management function. Public Affairs planners should be part of the ongoing planning
     process, which includes community involvement. Funds to support community
     involvement taskings should be managed by the Public Affairs office responsible for the
     community involvement.
     3.2.3. Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Funds. The majority of PA activities are
     funded with O&M funds. The Public Affairs resource manager, responsibility center, or
     cost center manager should work with the local budget office to become familiar with PA
     specific program elements, elements of expense investment codes (EEIC), responsibility
     center/cost center codes, emergency and special program codes, and budget program
     activity codes (BPAC). Learn the various codes for authorizing expenditures and how
     they apply to the office‟s programs. Generally, most of the Public Affairs budget will come
     from O&M funds allocated from your base operating support program element.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                       37


   3.2.4. Unique Public Affairs Program Elements. Most funding for Public Affairs programs
   is allocated in the following Public Affairs O&M program element codes: 91214 and
   91298, 91212 (service-wide Public Affairs support), and 91515 (Commander‟s
   Representation Funds). Check with your wing comptroller or the MAJCOM/PA for
   specific information on availability of funding from these sources.
   3.2.5. Budget Training. It is the responsibility of Public Affairs people to manage and
   control the funding allocated to the Public Affairs Office by the wing commander. Skills
   required include obtaining timely obligation records from your FM budget analyst,
   analyzing those expenditures, and projecting excess or shortages of funding.
   Identifying and justifying requirements during budget exercises is critical to
   adequately funding PA programs. All comptroller organizations provide Resource
   Advisor/Responsibility Center/Cost Center Manager training for wing organizations in
   accordance with AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures. Ensure
   training is received within 90 days of the member‟s assignment. References for Resource
   Advisors/Responsibility Center/Cost Center Managers are: AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget
   Guidance and Procedures; AFI65-603, Official Representation Funds — Guidance and
   Procedures; and AFPD 65-6, Financial Management: Budget. Check with your wing and
   MAJCOM Comptroller organization for local procedures that will pertain specifically to
   resource advisor responsibilities.
3.3. Public Affairs Manpower. Manpower represents the number of people needed to perform
the mission. Each Public Affairs office is staffed to support the commander‟s Public Affairs
program.     Current Public Affairs manpower standards can be found at
https://www.afma.randolph.af.mil/afms/af/l04a.pdf in FAC 104A. If a mission change
requires a change in staff levels, see AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower Requirements, and
speak to the installation manpower office and MAJCOM PA resource manager. These resources
will guide you through the process of applying for new manpower requirements.
   3.3.1. Each application for new manpower requirements must identify where the new
   spaces will come from. There is no manpower pool from which new requirements can be
   created. Air Force‟s authorized manpower is established by appropriations legislation
   enacted each year and distributed to the military departments through the DOD budget. Air
   Force then determines manpower levels for each command, and distribution locks in the
   total Air Force strength. An addition to a functional area usually can be made only when a
   manpower space is transferred from another functional area within that command. There are
   budget and manpower processes that must be completed before any realignment can take
   place.
3.4. Office Management. The Public Affairs officer must understand and apply sound
management practices. Orderly administrative procedures are the blueprint for successfully
meeting Public Affairs responsibilities. Analyzing and evaluating performance indicates how
office productivity is measured and monitored.
   3.4.1. Recommended reference materials can be separated into three categories: standard,
   recurring, and local. This is not an all-inclusive listing; the requirements of each Public
   Affairs level are different.

     3.4.2. Use a computer database whenever possible. Many of the directives, fact sheets,
     biographies, newspapers and general information can be accessed via computer on the
     Internet or CD.

        can register for the Air Force Portal online at https://www.my.af.mil and view PA
        specific information in the PA Community of practice.
3.8. Office Policies and Procedures. There are many essential tasks within every public
affairs office that must be completed to maintain an effective office. Some routine clerical
duties such as correspondence control and files maintenance are often an overlooked portion of
the Air Force Public Affairs Program. Yet, administrative functions are the tools by which
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           43


resources are effectively used and managed. No Public Affairs office can operate successfully
without complying with administrative and managerial policies, procedures, and requirements.
PA offices should establish guidelines and operating instructions (to include both administrative
tasks and those items listed previously) based on the mission and personnel within that office.
3.9. Office Augmentation. Situations may arise where additional short-term manning is
required. Temporary manning assistance may be available from Reservists or higher
headquarters. Check with higher headquarters PA to discuss manning assistance options.
3.10. Public Affairs Force Development. Public Affairs Force Development efforts focus on
providing the right mix and timing of education, training and experiences to produce strategic
communication leaders capable of employing communication to achieve national objectives.
While preparing for future challenges is central to the Force Development construct, the most
important developmental priority for Public Affairs personnel is performance and growth in
the currently assigned job. The Public Affairs Development Team (DT) works in conjunction
with SAF/PAR and the Public Affairs Assignments managers to ensure PA professionals obtain
the right developmental experiences at the right time to fulfill current and future institutional
requirements.
3.11. Assignments. Public Affairs assignment managers at the Air Force Personnel Center
and the AF/ DPO use available resources to fill assignments for officers, enlisted members and
civilian grades GS-7 through GS-15. Using established force development principles,
assignments managers match individuals to assignments consistent with the individuals‟
abilities, experience and stage of development. These managers implement career field
assignment policies determined by SAF/PA within the boundaries of Air Force personnel
directives.
   3.11.1. The Air Force Personnel Center PA assignments officer is involved with the
   assignment of each officer through lieutenant colonel in coordination with DT vectors,
   MAJCOM PA directors and commanders and SAF/PA. AF/DPO is the focal point for
   colonel assignments.
   3.11.2. The assignment of each enlisted member through senior master sergeant is the
   responsibility of the Airman Assignments Division of the Air Force Personnel Center.
   AF/DPE is the focal point for chief master sergeant assignments.
   3.11.3. Public Affairs Civilian Force Management (AFPC/DPKCC) recruits, develops and
   sustains the civilian work force to help cultivate highly qualified Public Affairs
   professionals. The Public Affairs Civilian Force Manager at the Air Force Personnel Center
   oversees all aspects of force development for civilian Air Force public affairs specialists and
   public affairs writers/editors.
3.12. Training and Education Programs. The Public Affairs career field offers opportunities
for professional development to enhance Public Affairs skills at the entry, intermediate and
advanced stages of one‟s career. Public Affairs training is available beyond courses taught by the
Defense Information School or Air Force Institute of Technology. Training is sometimes
offered in conjunction with Public Affairs conferences, and many courses related to Public
Affairs practice are offered by academic institutions, professional societies, and contractors.
SAF/PAR monitors Air Force programs designed to train and educate personnel assigned to
Public Affairs.

     DINFOS courses. DINFOS graduates may request an official transcript be sent to their
     college                or                university                by               visiting
     http://www.dinfos.osd.mil/Students/TranscriptRequest.asp.
     3.12.2. Obtaining Training Quotas. MAJCOM PAs obtain DINFOS and other training
     quotas by identifying and submitting requirements to Air Education and Training
     Command (AETC) through their MAJCOM training managers. These requirements are
     based on projected training requirements collected from Air Force units during AETC‟s
     annual screening process. MAJCOM PAs are allocated training quotas based on requirements
     and availability of funds. MAJCOM PAs should closely monitor and fill established quotas
     to ensure training continuity. If MAJCOM PAs do not receive sufficient AETC-funded
     training quotas to fulfill established requirements, they or their individual units may fund
     the travel and per diem costs as long as a course has available seats. Check with the
     MAJCOM PA resource manager for available options.
     3.12.3. Public Affairs Distance Learning. The Air Force Institute for Advanced Distributed
     Learning (AFIADL) at Maxwell Air Force Base, AL, offers several distance learning options
     for Public Affairs. First is the Air Force Public Affairs Officer Course, Specialty Course
     07920, which is available to all officer, enlisted and civilian employees. Enrollment details
     are available at base education offices. Air Force officers not in Public Affairs
     assignments, but who want to enter the career field, should take this course for background
     and to prepare for future assignments. Second are Career Development Courses (CDCs).
     Two courses are available for on-the-job training of Public Affairs enlisted personnel;
     civilians may also register. The CDCs are Public Affairs Specialist and Radio and
     Television Broadcasting Specialist. Enrollment procedures are described in the AFIADL
     Catalog and Guide maintained in base education offices.
     3.12.4. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT). AFIT, headquartered at Wright-
     Patterson AFB, Ohio, manages education for Air Force officers in Public Affairs and mass
     communication at a number of civilian universities and companies throughout the United
     States. Several Public Affairs officers are selected each year to pursue advanced degrees
     in communication or related disciplines at civilian universities through the AFIT Civilian
     Institution (CI) program. Others may be selected for the Education With Industry (EWI)
     program and spend a year doing a public affairs or public relations internship in a civilian
     company. Interested officers should contact the Public Affairs assignments officer at the
     Air Force Personnel Center for more details.
     3.12.5. Joint Course in Communication (JCC). The Department of Defense Joint Course in
     Communication is an eight-week course of instruction at the University of Oklahoma that

                                           Chapter 4

                              COMMUNICATION PLANNING

4.1. Purpose. Public Affairs must take the initiative to communicate its key messages to
important audiences on PA‟s own terms. This chapter explains how Public Affairs staffs can
set an agenda for active communication through strategic and tactical planning.
4.2. Research. The first phase in effective communication is research. The goal of this phase is
to take a comprehensive look at all the variables that will have an impact on planning to
communicate. There are two types of research: quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative
measures, such as scientific surveys, produce hard data, but take some special skills to perform
correctly. Qualitative measures, such as personal interviews, give less concrete information, but
can provide deeper understanding.
   4.2.1. A starting point during the research phase is determining the communication
   challenges facing the organization over a specific period of time, for example a year to 18
   months. The concentration of this research should be focused on commander‟s intent and
   unit mission accomplishment. Focus should be placed on the target audience, key
   messages and spokespeople and the desired audience reaction rather than producing a base
   newspaper every week. Strategic mindset is more productive in this stage.
   4.2.2. Historically, Public Affairs hasn‟t put much emphasis on the desired reaction of its
   audiences. Public Affairs will communicate for effect. In some cases, it will be to create
   awareness that can be translated into support for the Air Force. In other situations, we may
   want to encourage those in our audiences to take a specific action. It‟s important the Public
   Affairs staff--and the commander--decide in advance what they want the result to be.
   4.2.3. After determining challenges, it‟s important to scope out the communication
   environment. To do this, answer the following questions:
       4.2.3.1. What does the public think of the Air Force in general and your organization in
       particular? What is the public‟s level of awareness on the issues you‟ll be communicating?
       Does the public have opinions on these matters? If so, what are they? Where do
       the civilians you‟ll be communicating with get their information on the Air Force and
       your organization?
       4.2.3.2. What government actions--local, state, and federal--impact your organization
       and the issues you‟re working on? How do these actions limit your communications
       efforts, if at all? Do the political leaders at these levels and their staff members
       understand the Air Force position? What avenues for communicating with government
       officials are open to you?
       4.2.3.3. How have the media reported on the Air Force, your organization, and the
       issues? Have they treated the Air Force fairly? Do they understand the issues? If
       you‟re receiving criticism, where is it coming from and on what issues?
       4.2.3.4. What have senior leaders--at the base, the major command, and Air Force
       headquarters--been saying about the Air Force, your organization, and the issues? What
       do they feel is the current state of affairs, and how would they change things?
48                                               AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


        4.2.3.5. What is the communications climate within your organization? What attitudes
        are most prevalent among officers, enlisted people, civilian employees, and family
        members? What do these groups know about the issues you‟ll be communicating?
        What are the most credible methods of providing information to the people in your
        organization?
        4.2.3.6. Where will you discover the greatest inertia if you try something new? Some
        actions may require much more effort to change than others because of how long they‟ve
        been around and who would be most affected by a change to “business as usual.“
        Recognizing where you‟re likely to experience friction is the first step in keeping your
        strategies and tactics practical.
     4.2.4. The measure of success in a communication program is whether knowledge, attitudes
     or behaviors have shifted over time. Therefore, during the research phase, it‟s important to
     learn what potential audiences know, believe, and do before communicating with them.
     A variety of methods of collecting this information is available. It‟s fairly simple to design,
     seek approval for, field, and analyze the results of a survey of internal audiences prior to
     and following communication efforts. Remember, Air Force Personnel Center officials
     must approve all surveys of Air Force people, so check with your Military Personnel Flight
     as you begin to develop a questionnaire. The Public Affairs staff also can do some
     qualitative research by talking with commanders, first sergeants, the equal opportunity
     officer, the personnel officer, and the wing inspector to get a feel for what is on the minds of
     the base population. Seek out official reports such as base crime statistics and reenlistment
     rates — any indicator that might illustrate the current communications environment.
     4.2.5. It‟s a bit more difficult to do research on civilian audiences. One method is to do a
     content analysis of media coverage in the area. The local chamber of commerce may be able
     to sponsor a survey of community business leaders. The Public Affairs staff may be able to
     devise other innovative ways to obtain hard data. Even if chamber officials can‟t help with
     new research, they may have already completed demographic, economic, or attitude
     surveys that may be helpful in planning. In the absence of statistical research, consider
     qualitative analysis. Again, this involves discussions with business people and reporters in
     the area. This will provide a fairly good idea of how the public and the media view the
     organization, the Air Force, and the issues.
        4.2.5.1. Although this may seem like a great deal of work, remember one of the important
        roles of the Public Affairs staff is to provide the commander periodic assessments of
        what people on- and off-base are thinking about the organization and the Air Force.
        This research will produce the authoritative information necessary to achieve the
        Public Affairs core competency of providing trusted counsel to leaders.
     4.2.6. Other sources of information will prove valuable in preparing the plan. Air Force
     Issues & Answers, at http://www.issues.af.mil, contains research sections with the results of
     commercial civilian public opinion polls. Additionally, research firms maintain public Web
     sites. Some of the survey results posted on these sites provide helpful insights on public
     attitudes toward the military. This research is conducted periodically by the staff at the Air
     Force Personnel Center under the supervision of SAF/PA.
     4.2.7. In addition to finding out as much as possible about audiences, the research effort
     should include compiling a list of communication channels within and outside the
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           49


   organization. Take note of military and civilian publications and electronic outlets as well as
   special events on and off-base that might serve as forums for passing information to key
   audiences. The lists of possible audiences and communication channels in Figure 4.1 and
   Figure 4.2 may be helpful during brainstorming.
   4.2.8. Data collected during the situation analysis will provide direction throughout the
   remainder of the planning process.
4.3. Planning. This phase of our communication can be either strategic or tactical. Strategic
planning is broad in scope and focused into the future. Strategic planning considers the basic
nature (mission) and direction (strategy) of an organization. The process involves deciding on
objectives and the general methods that can be used to achieve these objectives. Tactical
planning focuses on elements of the strategic plan. It is concerned with short-term results and is
much more detailed than is strategic planning. Tactical planning is the process of determining the
specific operations that will achieve the broad objectives of the strategic plan.
   4.3.1. An effective communication program features elements of both strategic and tactical
   planning. On the one hand, it involves taking a long-term look at your program, deciding
   what you and your commander want to accomplish, determining general actions you should
   take, and finally listing specific tactics to achieve your goals. Armed with this overall plan,
   you can flesh out the details of your individual tactics.
   4.3.2. This is not a new concept to many Air Force Public Affairs people. Many Public
   Affairs professionals have studied it and comprehend it completely. The problem is that,
   despite our intellectual understanding of the process, we rarely take the time to put it into
   practice. Although we may think about what we want to accomplish over the course of a
   year, we fail to commit our plans to writing. Using the following steps in strategic
   communication planning can lead to a more effective Public Affairs program.
   4.3.3. After determining the issues and assessing the environment, it is time to define
   communication objectives. These are statements of what the Public Affairs staff and the
   commander want to accomplish, not how to accomplish these actions.
       4.3.3.1. In setting communication objectives, it is important to determine what impact
       we want our messages to have on intended audiences. For example, we may want to:
           4.3.3.1.1. Gain informed public support for a new aircraft being introduced at a base.
           4.3.3.1.2. Lessen anxiety on- and off-base with respect to a hazardous environmental
           process.
           4.3.3.1.3. Create awareness and acceptance for a new enlisted personnel system.
       4.3.3.2. In preparing strategic plans, Public Affairs staffs must keep in mind several
       criteria for developing good objectives. Objectives should:
           4.3.3.2.1. Support the organization‟s purposes and missions.
           4.3.3.2.2. Be understood and accepted by the people within the organization--leaders
           and their subordinates.
           4.3.3.2.3. Be measurable, stating in concrete terms what is going to happen. Know
           before you begin how you intend to measure your plan‟s success.

            4.3.3.2.4. Be feasible: individually achievable and, when taken collectively, not
            overextending the capacity of the staff.
            4.3.3.2.5. Be firm but able to adapt in the event of unforeseen contingencies.
            4.3.3.2.6. Engender enthusiasm and commitment on the part of those who have to
            carry out the plan.
     4.3.4. The next step in the planning process is establishing strategies. These are simply
     general statements of how to achieve the objectives. They state, for instance, the Public
     Affairs staff will employ various types of community relations events, media operations
     efforts, internal communication channels, and other activities to communicate with intended
     audiences. Some example strategies are:
        4.3.4.1. Invite civilian groups to attend functions on the base.
        4.3.4.2. Schedule base speakers at events in the community.
        4.3.4.3. Arrange for military representatives to serve on various civic committees.
        4.3.4.4. Set up contact with newspaper, magazine, television, and radio reporters.
        4.3.4.5. Ensure all commanders and staff agency chiefs meet regularly with the people
        in their units.
        4.3.4.6. Use the base newspaper to provide key organizational and Air Force news to base
        people.
        4.3.4.7. Produce a weekly news program for the base cable access channel.
        4.3.4.8. Use Air Force News Service products to tell the story at the national level.
     4.3.5. The temptation in communication planning is trying to develop tactics as the first step.
     It‟s crucial in this process that each of the steps outlined above be completed before starting
     to list tactics.
        4.3.5.1. Tactics are the very detailed actions necessary to achieve objectives. This phase
        of planning integrates specific messages, spokespersons, and communication channels
        into initiatives that flesh out the general actions listed as strategies.
        4.3.5.2. The strategic plan simply lists the messages, audiences, and spokespersons that
        should be employed over the life of the plan. It also provides a range of tactics under
        various strategies. This plan stops short of integrating these various aspects into a time
        line with exact dates the initiatives will take place.
        4.3.5.3. The tactical plan is much more specific. In addition to listing each tactic and
        indicating which strategy or strategies it supports, the tactical plan indicates precisely
        when the action will take place (a specific date or continuously). An excellent way to
        display the tactics is a communication air tasking order (ATO), which is a time line that
        lists in chronological order actions to be taken through the duration of the plan. The
        ATO should indicate the following for each initiative: date; spokesperson; audience;
        action (event, publication, Web site etc.) and message.
     4.3.6. Following completion of the plan, it is crucial for the Public Affairs staff to gain the
     support of the organization‟s chain of command prior to execution. Briefings at the
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                              51


   commander‟s staff meeting will allow him or her to endorse the plan in front of the staff. The
   Public Affairs staff also should visit other key leaders to explain the plan and build
   cooperation necessary to successfully accomplish the objectives.
4.4. Execution. The execution phase involves completing the tasks contained in the plan. It is
important to remember the plan is simply a starting point in carrying out a variety of
communication initiatives. It should be viewed as a “living” document. As the situation
changes and as the Public Affairs team determines the effectiveness of various tactics, the
individual elements of the plan--strategies, audiences, actions, messages, etc.--may be
updated.
   4.4.1. Be aware of the effect that changing tactics may have on the larger, strategic plan.
   Adding tasks may sap resources from other effects or tactics and endanger your success.
4.5. Evaluation. Communication is not complete without a measurement of success. This
analysis has nothing to do with how well the staff manages its program; the goal is to learn how
well the Public Affairs team communicates with its various audiences. Take another look at
some of the sample objectives above. They all involve communicating in a way that will have
an effect on the people on the receiving end of the information being transmitted.
   4.5.1. To measure communication effectiveness, use the indicators of success determined in
   the planning step. You cannot do effective evaluation “on the fly” after the fact. This will
   not only provide data on whether or not audiences received the appropriate messages, but
   it will also serve as a new baseline for communication initiatives for the next round of
   planning.
       4.5.1.1. After an honest evaluation, you will be able to use data and lessons learned in the
       research phase for future planning.
   4.5.2. As planning and evaluation become more commonplace within Public Affairs, it is
   important staffs share their plans and research data with others who may be working on
   similar initiatives. The PA Community of practice and MAJCOM information exchanges
   provide excellent vehicles for a cross flow of helpful material.
4.6. Constructing the Plan. Determine communications challenges. Analyze the situation.
Define objectives. Set strategies. Plan tactics. Evaluate effectiveness. Put this all together and it
yields a communication plan that combines the four elements of research, planning, execution,
and evaluation.
   4.6.1. One pointer: A Public Affairs professional should not attempt to work through this
   process alone. This approach can be most successfully employed when it is a team effort.
   Seek input from other functional areas with a heavy stake in the organization‟s
   communication, ask for feedback from other Public Affairs offices, and bounce it off the rest
   of the staff for refinement. It may be helpful to invite a few folks from other functional areas
   with a heavy stake in the organization‟s communication. Following this session, the person
   responsible can put the plan together and bounce it off the rest of the staff for refinement.
   This will yield a much better document than if it is written by a single individual.
   4.6.2. All Air Force Public Affairs officers should employ this process. It is the state-of-the-
   art technique for corporate and agency public relations practitioners. It focuses our efforts
    52                                               AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


         on what we want to accomplish through our communication, not just on whether or not we
         meet various quantitative goals.
            4.6.2.1. Like a good road map, a strategic plan will show the commander and those in
            other agencies within the organization where the Public Affairs team is headed and
            how it intends to get there. By investing a bit of hard work up front, the staff‟s
            communication efforts will be much more successful than if planning is done event by
            event.
         4.6.3. Figure 4.3. illustrates the elements that should be considered in a communication
         plan. Not every plan will have all these elements, but most plans will feature the headings
         listed in the chart.

WING STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION PLAN 03-1
1. PURPOSE: To conduct a coordinated, aggressive Public Affairs program designed to keep
the
 AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                               57


LeMay AFB work force and public audiences informed of the mission and activities of the 72nd
Fighter
Wing, Air Combat Command, and the U.S. Air Force.

2. SITUATION (A summary of what led to the need for this plan.)
a. Background: (Background may include, but is not limited to, summaries of baseline metrics,
statistics, focus group results, and research literature.)
b. Current Situation:
(1) The Air Force is currently in the midst of some of the most dramatic changes in the service‟s
history. As the Department of Defense budget shrinks and the size of our nation‟s military forces
decreases significantly, the organization of the Air Force also takes on a new look. Despite the
cuts in manpower and funding, the Air Force remains committed to its goal of providing Global
Reach and Global Power in defending the U.S. and its interests around the world. Likewise, the
mission of the 72nd Fighter Wing continues to be maintaining the professional people and the
state-of-the-art equipment necessary to assure U.S. air superiority in any conflict in which the
nation may become engaged.

(2) While 2003 will witness the wing‟s continued efforts to maintain a posture of superior military
readiness, this year will also feature aggressive measures to ensure environmental excellence at
LeMay AFB. Contamination created decades ago will be cleaned up, and advanced methods will
be employed to ensure the environment is kept free of further damage.

(3) LeMay AFB enjoys an outstanding relationship with the residents of Spring Valley. The
community is extremely supportive of the base, which annually pumps approximately $200
million into Spring Valley and the surrounding area. City leaders have provided excellent support
for the base‟s aggressive environmental-care programs.
c. Assumptions:
(1) The 72nd Fighter Wing Commander is ultimately responsible for providing information on
key issues to people on and off LeMay AFB.
(2) The Public Affairs program is the primary means through which the commander
communicates with internal and public audiences.
(3) The turbulence occurring within the Air Force is producing anxiety among military members,
civilian employees, and residents of the surrounding communities.
(4) To communicate effectively with important audiences, the wing‟s Public Affairs program must
be well planned in advance rather than reactive.
d. Supporting Interests: The Military Affairs Committee of the Spring Valley Chamber of
Commerce; the mayor, city manager, and their staffs; the local chapters of the Air Force
Association and Business Executives for National Defense; and Air Force recruiters in Spring
Valley and Madison will provide support for the execution of this plan.
e. References: AFI 35-101 provides guidance for the execution of this plan.
3. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES:
a. Establish awareness of and support for the wing‟s operational mission.
b. Create understanding of the base‟s efforts to improve and to maintain the environment. c.

Promote pride in the military and civilian employees who compose the wing.
d. Develop appreciation of the need for and value of the U.S. Air Force and Air Combat
Command.
4. AUDIENCES:
a. Internal Audiences:
(1) Wing and tenant unit officers, enlisted people, and civilian employees. (2) Families of base
military and civilian employees.
(3) General audiences within Air Combat Command and throughout the Air Force. b. Public
Audiences:
(1) Residents of Spring Valley and the surrounding communities.
(2) Business, civic, and government leaders in Spring Valley and throughout California.
5. THEMES AND MESSAGES:
a. Communication by wing personnel will focus primarily on the 72nd Fighter Wing messages
listed below:
(1) The men and women who make up the 72nd Fighter Wing are an integral part of the world‟s
finest and most respected air and space fighting force.
(2) The Air Force and Air Combat Command commitment to providing global reach and global
power is enhanced by the capability of the F-15Es of the 72nd Fighter Wing.
(3) One of the top priorities at LeMay AFB is protecting the environment.
(4) Officers, enlisted people, and civilians who serve in the wing may take great pride in their
accomplishments.
b. Additionally, those speaking on behalf of the wing will add Air Force and Air Combat
Command messages that tie into their topics. Applicable Air Force messages may be chosen
from Attachment 1, while Air Combat Command messages are listed in Attachment 2.
6. STRATEGIES AND TACTICS:
a. Use formal and informal awareness/opinion research on internal and public audiences in
planning and evaluating communication programs.
(1) Use results of the USAF Product/Media Use Survey and The Air Force Communications
Audit performed by the Wirthlin Group for AFNEWS to plan effective methods for reaching
internal audiences.
(2) Conduct research on preferred communication channels for wing audiences, and use results to
plan communication efforts.
(3) Conduct formal and informal research on- and off-base to evaluate the effectiveness of the
tactics employed as a part of this plan. Off-base research will be completed with the assistance
of:
(a) The Military Affairs Committee of the Spring Valley Chamber of Commerce
(b) The Spring Valley City Council
(c) The Spring Valley School Board
(4) Coordinate with Air Force News Service on the inclusion of wing messages of Air Force-wide
interest in AFNS products.
 AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                               59


b. Select and train wing leaders to address internal and public audiences.
(1) As a minimum, the following officials should participate in communication programs
designed to meet the objectives listed above:
(a) The wing commander
(b) The vice commander, operations group commander, logistics group commander, support
group commander, and medical group commander
(c) The senior enlisted adviser, all squadron commanders, chiefs of wing staff agencies, and
tenant unit commanders
(2) 72 FW/PA will conduct training on interview techniques and public speaking skills to prepare
these officers to meet the media and to address military and civilian audiences.
c. Provide information on the wing to people on-base and throughout the Air Force. (1) Redesign
the base newspaper using a magazine format to increase readership.
(2) Increase the viewership and expand the reach of the commander‟s access channel of the base
cable television system by broadcasting more timely information over the channel.
(a) Produce and air a 30-minute, repeating program featuring news, command information,
interviews with wing leaders and distinguished guests, Air Force heritage films, and character-
generated announcements (frequency to begin at one per week and increase as equipment
becomes available). (b) Develop technical capability and command policy to ensure televisions
in high-traffic areas--clubs, recreation center, waiting rooms, barber shops, etc--stay tuned to the
commander‟s access channel.
(3) Encourage unit commanders to conduct regular commander‟s calls and assist these leaders in
preparing to meet with their people through monthly commander‟s call topics memos.
(4) Coordinate with AFNEWS on the inclusion of wing messages in Airman, Air Force Print
News, Air
Force Television News, Air Force Radio News, and other products.
d. Arrange coverage of the wing in local, state, and specialized media.
(1) Include interviews, editorial boards, etc. in the travel plans of the wing commander. (2) Seek
interviews with and coverage in the following media:
(a) Local and state radio and television stations, newspapers, and magazines
(b) Defense journals: Air Force Times, Air Force Magazine, etc.
(3) Provide articles on wing people to hometown media through the Home Town News Center.
e. Set up opportunities for wing leaders to meet with key audiences in Spring Valley and
throughout
California.
(1) Sponsor an Air Force Tour for Spring Valley residents.
(2) Work with the Chamber of Commerce to arrange a sports day on the base for community and
military leaders.
(3) Conduct a base open house.
(4) Initiate contact with groups of business leaders in Spring Valley and invite these people to take
part in special base tours.

                                379TH AIR EXPEDITIONARY WING AL UDEID AIR BASE, QATAR




MEMORANDUM FOR ALL AL UDEID UNITS FROM: 379 AEW/CC
SUBJECT: Base tactical plan to implement DOD media embed program at Al Udeid


1. Situation: DOD is committed to the freest possible access to U.S. military units before, during and after contingencies in the
global war on terror, without compromising operations or security. Media coverage is crucial to maintaining public trust and
support, and countering misinformation tactics by our enemies. Successful engagement requires continuous near-real-time
coordination between military public affairs offices, affected military units and embedded media organizations in order to
accurately tell the story of U.S. operations while protecting classified/sensitive information.


2. OPR : 379 AEW/PA; direct questions to 471-2731 or 2702.


3. References: AFI-35-101; DOD Public Affairs Guidance (PAG) msg DTG: 101900Z Feb 03; USCENTAF/PA OI regarding
media embed.



4. Scope: This tactical plan applies to the 379 AEW, and, as coordinated, to U.S. military units operating on Al Udeid AB, Qatar.
It also applies, by exception, to coalition units at the same location, subject to approval by the coalition government.


5. Objectives:
a) Provide freest possible access to combat operations, from the very beginning.
b) Gain a position of trust with the press by being a timely, credible source of information.
c) Allow embedded news journalists to experience first-hand the conditions under which U.S. and coalition forces live and
operate, and to build rapport with those combat units the media are exposed to.


6. Guidance:
    a) Embed Media Ground Rules: For the safety and security of US forces and all embedded media, representatives will
adhere to established ground rules. Ground rules will be agreed to in advance and signed by all media prior to embedding.
Violation of any of the ground rules may result in immediate termination of the embed and removal from the AOR. Any such
termination will be coordinated with the USCENTAF Combined Press Information Center (CPIC).
     These ground rules recognize the right of the media to cover military operations and are in no way intended to prevent
release of derogatory, embarrassing, negative or uncomplimentary information. Local additions to the standard DOD ground
rules have been approved by the USCENTAF CPIC.
        AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                                                 63


.   Embedded media will be issued an identification card through Public Affairs. This card must be carried at all times, and shown
    prior to conducting interviews or other official business.


.   All interviews with servicemembers will be on the record. Security at the source is the policy. Scheduled interviews with pilots
    and aircrew members are authorized upon completion of missions; however, release of information must conform to these media
    ground rules, release/non-release guidelines listed in Para 4.G and security review provisions listed in Para 6.A of SECDEF
    Message 101900Z FEB 03.


o   Media may approach any military member for “spot interviews” so long as it does not interfere with the performance of their
    duties. Media must identify themselves before beginning such interviews. Airmen have the right to decline spot interviews, but
    are encouraged to take advantage of the opportunity to tell the Air Force story.


o   Conversations in the following areas of Al Udeid are “off the record” and no recording devices of any kind will be allowed
    unless coordinated in advance by Public Affairs: The “Wagon Wheel” recreational area; The Point Officer‟s Club, and Jack‟s
    Lounge. Media are encouraged, however, to socialize with Airmen in these locations.


.   Media representatives will not be continuously escorted while on Al Udeid. Escort is required in those areas of the base where
    the average Airman would also require escort for periodic access (i.e. the flightline, operations and maintenance facilities and
    command/control facilities).


.   Datelines for media products will be in accordance with the most current guidance by the Qatar government, and coordinated as
    needed through command channels with USCENTAF/PA CPIC.


    .               Media embedded with US forces are not permitted to carry personal firearms.


.   Media are not authorized to use their own transportation on the installation. They may access the base shuttle system and/or ride
    as passengers in vehicles assigned to Al Udeid. UPARs and PA may assist with transportation on a case-by-case basis, but are not
    responsible for the constant movement of media representatives. PA will arrange group transportation when needed for special
    events or major contingencies.


.   Light discipline restrictions will be followed. Visible light sources, including flash or television lights are essential for recording
    operations, but must be balanced with the need to preserve night vision and avoid interference with night operations. Use of such
    equipment will be coordinated in advance through the operations group.


.   Embargoes of media products may be imposed to permit documentation of operations while protecting operational security.
    Embargoes will only be used for OPSEC and will be lifted as soon as the OPSEC issue has passed.


.   There will be no general security review of media products prior to transmission. Such review, however, may be a condition of
    access to certain sensitive operations, equipment or facilities. These will be identified in advance, and will be the exception, not
    the rule.
        64                                                       AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009



    In addition to the above, non-embed media who visit the base will observe the following:
    .               Media must follow PA instructions at all times.
.   Provide for their own support, as well as data transmission and personal protective gear. It‟s possible that no government meals,
    lodging, or ground transportation will be available.
.   All host nation requirements must be met by media, i.e. passports, visas, inoculations, etc. It is the media‟s responsibility to
    request and obtain documents through the embassy or consulate serving their area prior to arriving at Al Udeid for a media event.


                  b. Unit Public Affairs Representatives: To provide maximum flexibility for the large number of media scheduled for
    embed at Al Udeid, each squadron and tenant unit on-base will appoint a primary and alternate unit public affairs representatives.
    These representatives must provide 24-hour contact coverage for their unit. Commanders should consider the need for immediate
    availability when making appointments, and not assign the responsibility to those whose primary duties would keep them from
    assisting PA in a timely manner. These individuals will coordinate with public affairs to provide information in response to
    queries, process requests for access and special events, and to resolve issues that may arise.
                  c. Unit sponsorship of embedded media: Each non-flying squadron on-base will be „host‟ to an evenly distributed
    number of embedded media. Billeting of media will be based on this arrangement. These partnerships are an administrative
    function only. It is not meant to grant exclusive access to that particular unit for the assigned media representatives, or to prevent
    them from covering units other than their host. The host unit provides an additional point of contact besides PA for media
    representatives to resolve issues concerning administration, housing and services while living on Al Udeid. To prevent the
    appearance of favoritism, no media will be hosted by flying squadrons.


    7. Daily Ops for Embed Media
    Daily operations will ensure timely release of newsworthy information, and the broadest possible coverage of all aspects of the
    base mission. News media will naturally gravitate towards those units most likely to be directly involved in combat. PA
    operations will ensure reasonable access to those units while maintaining OPSEC, and also direct attention to less operational, but
    equally important mission support functions.


.   Each day, PA will coordinate with UPARs to develop an “ATO” or “opportunity menu” to be briefed to the media the next
    morning. This brief update will consist of wing and individual events that may be of interest to media as well as an update on
    operations. The wing commander, vice-commander or wing leadership designee will attend these sessions, schedule permitting,
    to provide regular access for Q&A with the wing leadership.


.   Media Training All commanders, first sergeants and UPARs will be issued a simple pocket guide listing interview
    tips/prohibitions and Coalition/AF messages targeted by the current phase of operations. These individuals must ensure their
    unit understands both the intent of the embed program, and the messages the Air Force needs to convey. Units are encouraged to
    schedule public affairs to brief/train unit personnel at a commander‟s call or similar gathering, and one-on-one training for
    specific events.


.   Logistics- The wing will provide secure housing and workspace. Media are expected to be largely self-reliant for communications,
    but the wing will support transmission needs consistent with operational requirements. This support can include, but is not
    limited to, worldwide telephone access, NIPRNET access, and audiovisual support equipment. Public Affairs will coordinate
    with the communication squadron and U.S. Embassy any media requests to set up communications equipment to include, but not
    limited to, satellite dishes, microwave relays and repeaters.
      AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                                                 65

.   Media Flights — Media flights on AF aircraft are one of the most effective ways to tell the operational story. Such flights are
    permitted and encouraged within mission constraints. Media flight approval is delegated to CFACC/PA. All such media requests
    will be forwarded to CFACC/PA NLT 24 hours prior to the desired date and time with the following information:


    - Media organization and name(s) of representatives to be flown
    - Social Security Numbers / passport numbers of all participants
    - Any flight qualification information (i.e. chamber card, aircrew training, etc.)
    - List of photographic/video equipment to accompany participants
    - Type of airframe for the mission and assigned unit
    - Wing commander recommendation (support or non-concur)


.   Media transportation between embed locations — Several AEWs will host media that have been permitted embeds at two separate
    locations. Space available transportation between the two locations is permitted on military aircraft. Embed duration for each
    unit will be best determined by the desires of the assigned media, the pace of operations and the needs of the Air Force.


    Media engagement now plays a critical role determining our mission success. These instructions are not exhaustive, and
    unforeseen situations will occur. Operational security is the first concern when in doubt, but should not be used as a blanket
    justification to deny, delay or obstruct legitimate access to the mission. Immediately direct any concerns to Public Affairs for
    resolution.

    GROUND RULES FOR MED1A


    For the safety and security of US forces and embedded media, media will adhere to established ground rules. Ground rules will be
    agreed to in advance and signed by media prior to embedding. Violation of the ground rules may result in the immediate
    termination of the embed and removal from the AOR. These ground rules recognize the right of the media to cover military
    operations and are in no way intended to prevent release of derogatory, embarrassing, negative or uncomplimentary information.
    Base level modifications to the standard ground rules have been coordinated through 9 AETF/PA to CENTCOM/PA for
    approval. Release and non-release categories of information are attached. Signing this document constitutes agreement to these
    categories. The document is also available at http://www.issues.af.mil/MediaSupport.shtml. This site is accessible only from a
    dot.mil IP address.


    Standard ground rules are:


.   All interviews with servicemembers will be on the record. Security at the source is the policy. Media must identify themselves
         66                                                      AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009

    and show their base ID prior to conducting a spot interview. Scheduled interviews with pilots and aircrew members are authorized
    upon completion of missions; however, release of information must conform to these media ground rules.


o   Conversations in the following areas of Al Udeid are “off the record” and no recording devices of any kind will be allowed
    unless coordinated in advance by Public Affairs: The “Wagon Wheel” recreational area; The Point Officer‟s Club, and Jack‟s
    Lounge. Media are encouraged, however, to socialize with Airmen in these locations.


.   Out of deference to our host nation, print or broadcast stories will be datelined “Southwest Asia” or “with deployed forces,”
    unless instructed otherwise.


.   Media embedded with US forces are not permitted to carry personal firearms, and may not operate their own vehicles on the
    installation.


.   Light discipline restrictions will be followed. Visible light sources, including flash or television lights, flash cameras will not be
    used when operating with forces at night unless specifically approved in advance by the on-scene commander.


.   Embargoes may be imposed to protect operational security. Embargoes will only be used for operational security and will be
    lifted as soon as the operational security issue has passed.


.   There will be no general security review of media products prior to transmission. Such review, however, may be a condition of
    access to certain sensitive operations, equipment or facilities. These will be identified in advance, and will be the exception, not
    the rule.


.   Allied forces operating on Al Udeid will largely conform to these practices, subject to the requirements of their government and
    military procedures. Direct concerns to the 379 AEW Public Affairs office for coordination and resolution.

    RELEASE, INDEMNIFICATION, AND HOLD HARMLESS AGREMENT AND AGREEMENT NOT TO SUE


    1. The United States of America (the “Government”), acting by and through the Department of Defense, believes it to be mutually
    beneficial to both the Government and news media organizations (“media organizations”) to place selected news media
    organization employees (“media employees”) with selected military units (“military units”) for the purpose of providing news
    media coverage before, during, and after military operations. The placement of media employees with military units is referred to
  AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                                                  67

in this Agreement as “embedding” or the “embedding process” and will require media employees to live, travel, eat, sleep, and
conduct all professional and personal activities with the military unit to which the media employees are “embedded.”


2. Definitions.
a. The term “Government” means the United States Government, including its departments, subdivisions, agencies,
instrumentalities, officers, employees (including military and civilian personnel), servants, contractors, volunteers, and agents.
b. The term “media organization” means the “media employee‟s” employer, a registered US or foreign profit or not-for-profit
organization, its successors, and assigns.
c. The term “media employee” means an employee or agent of a “media organization”, his or her guardians, executors,
administrators, heirs, and assigns.
3. Media organizations and media employees understand and agree that the embedding process will expose media employees to
the same risks and hazards as those to which the military members of military units are exposed, including the extreme and
unpredictable risks of war, combat operations, and combat support operations, as well as common and uncommon hazards of
military living. Media organizations and media employees fully understand and appreciate the following:
a. The embedding process will expose media employees to all hazards of a military environment, including but not limited to the
extreme and unpredictable hazards of war, combat operations, and combat support operations. The military environment is
inherently dangerous and may result in death or personal injury of media employees or damage to personal property.
b. The embedding process may include strenuous and inherently dangerous activities, including transportation in, and close
proximity to, military tactical vehicles, aircraft, watercraft, and other Government (and Government contracted) vehicles and
may involve substantial risk of serious injury or death as the result of the media employee‟s own actions or inaction, the actions or
inactions of others including agents, contractors, officers, servicemembers, and employees of the Government, the conditions of
the Government facility and the natural environment, the known or unknown condition of any government-furnished equipment,
and the inherent dangers of war, combat operations, and combat support operations.
c. The embedding process requires media employees to be in overall good physical health and condition. Persons who are not in
overall good physical health and condition should not participate in the embedding process. Media employees should consult their
physicians prior to embedding to be certain they are qualified to do so. Persons with a history of heart or lung disease or
conditions, or coronary disease, or other chronic or pervasive diseases or conditions may not participate. Likewise, those women
currently pregnant may not participate. Anyone suffering from any injuries, conditions, ailments or pre-existing conditions that
could be affected by the embedding process may not participate.
d. As part of the embedding process, the Government will make available anthrax and smallpox vaccinations to media employees,
provided it is done at no cost to the Government (full reimbursement of all Government costs) and provided that the media
employees sign an additional agreement regarding the risks involved. These vaccinations are voluntary and are not a prerequisite
for participating in the embedding process. Media organizations and media employees agree, for those media employees
choosing to receive the anthrax and smallpox vaccinations, that this Release, Indemnification, and Hold Harmless Agreement and
Agreement Not to Sue specifically includes all risks and hazards associated with the smallpox and anthrax vaccinations,
including any negative reactions, adverse effects, including the media employee‟s illness, infirmity, or death.

4. The media employee agrees to:
a. Participate in the embedding process and to follow the direction and orders of the
Government related to such participation. The media employee further agrees to follow
Government regulations. The media employee acknowledges that failure to follow any direction, order, regulation, or ground
rule may result in the termination of the media employee‟s participation in the embedding process.
b. Voluntarily, willingly, and knowingly ASSUME ANY AND ALL RISKS, known and unknown, in any way associated with the
embedding process, war, combat operations, and combat support operations.
c. RELEASE, INDEMNIFY, AND HOLD HARMLESS the Government from and against any claims, demands, actions, liens,
rights, subrogated or contribution interests, debts, liabilities, judgments, costs, and attorney‟s fees, arising out of, claimed on
account of, or in any manner predicated upon the media employee‟s participation in the embedding process, including any loss or
damage to property or the personal injury or death of any person which may occur as a result of the media employee‟s
participation in the embedding process, even where that loss, damage, personal injury, or death is caused or contributed to, in any
manner, by the Government.

5. The media organization agrees to permit its media employees to participate in the embedding process. As a condition of being
permitted to participate in the embedding process, the media organization agrees to RELEASE, INDEMNIFY, AND HOLD
HARMLESS the Government from and against any claims, demands, actions, liens, rights, subrogated or contribution interests,
debts, liabilities, judgments, costs, and attorney‟s fess arising out of, claimed on account of, or in any manner predicated upon the
media employee‟s participation in the embedding process, including any loss or damage to property or the personal injury or
death of any person, even where that loss, damage, personal injury, or death is caused or contributed to, in any manner, by the
Government.


6. The media organization and media employee hereby covenant and agree they will never institute, prosecute or in any way aid
in the institution or prosecution of any demand, claim or suit against the Government for any destruction, loss, or damage to the
media organization‟s property or the media employee‟s property, or the personal injury or death of media employees which may
occur as a result of the media employee‟s participation in the embedding process.


7. The media organization and media employee grant express, voluntary, and knowing consent to the rendering of all emergency
medical or dental treatment that may, in the professional judgment of a Government medical or dental officer, become necessary
while participating in the embedding process. Transportation to a definitive Government or commercial care facility may be
required as an adjunct to authorized emergency medical or dental care. Persons receiving Government medical or dental care who
are not otherwise eligible to receive such care shall be obligated to reimburse the Government.


8. The media organization and the media employee understand and agree that the Government may terminate the embedding
process at any time and for any reason, as the Government determines appropriate in its sole discretion.


9. This Release, Indemnification, Hold Harmless Agreement and Agreement Not to Sue shall be interpreted according to federal
IAW. It is to be construed as broadly and inclusively as is permitted by relevant federal IAW. If any portion of this document is
held invalid, the balance shall continue in full force and effect.

  4.7. Public Affairs Guidance (PAG). SAF/PA routinely provides Public Affairs guidance
  (PAG) on various issues to Public Affairs staffs, band commanders, and recruiters. PAG
  includes background on the situation, summarizes communication objectives, outlines actions
  officials at HQ USAF will take, and directs commanders and Public Affairs staffs on what they
  can and cannot say or do. In addition, it contains tough questions likely to be asked and
  provides appropriate responses. When possible, PAG also includes quotes on the issue by
  senior USAF and DOD officials.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         69


  4.7.1. PAG is prepared and sent to the field in a timely manner. In some situations,
  SAF/PA issues interim guidance explaining what field units can do until more definitive
  direction is available. SAF/ PA then works with HQ USAF and OASD (PA) staffs to prepare
  complete guidance that can be issued following full coordination.
  4.7.2. Subordinate organizations may be required to prepare Public Affairs guidance. All
  field Public Affairs staffs must understand only SAF/PA can issue Public Affairs policy
  guidance and direct implementation throughout the Air Force. Staffs at lower levels can
  publish guidance directing subordinate units to comply, but they cannot direct Public Affairs
  activity beyond their commands. If an organization desires to publish Public Affairs
  guidance throughout the Air Force, that organization must submit the proposed PAG
  through its higher headquarters to arrive at SAF/PA at least 15 days prior to the desired date
  of publication. SAF/PA will obtain HQ USAF approval for the guidance and issue it from
  Washington.

                                            Chapter 5

                                 INTERNAL INFORMATION

Section 5A—Internal Information Purpose and Responsibilities

5.1. Purpose of Internal Information. Conducting internal information programs is the
primary means Air Force leaders use to communicate with Airmen and their families. As used in
this instruction Airmen are active-duty and retired, officer and enlisted, Guard and Reserve,
civilian and contract employees. The main purpose of conducting internal information programs
is to link Airmen and their leaders. Timely, accurate, relevant information is a force multiplier
that enhances Airman morale and readiness. The Public Affairs triad must have the knowledge
and skills to conduct internal information programs at home and while deployed as an
expeditionary Public Affairs force.
5.2. Objectives of the Internal Information Program.
     5.2.1. Link Airmen and their leaders through a free flow of news and information.
     5.2.2. Help Airmen understand their roles in the Air Force.
     5.2.3. Explain how policies, programs and operations affect Airmen.
     5.2.4. Promote good citizenship and build pride as members of the civilian community at
     home and in foreign countries.
     5.2.5. Recognize individual and team achievements.
     5.2.6. Provide avenues for feedback.
5.3. HQ USAF Responsibilities. At HQ USAF level, the Director of Public Affairs is the
functional manager of the internal information program, which in turn is implemented by Air
Force News Agency, San Antonio, Texas.
5.4. Major Command (MAJCOM), Field Operating Agency (FOA) and Direct Reporting
Unit (DRU) Responsibilities. Directors and chiefs of Public Affairs conduct internal
information programs to help the commander keep Airmen informed about missions and issues.
They provide command specific policy, guidance and products.
5.5. Unit Commander Responsibilities. The host commander‟s internal information program
serves the entire Air Force base audience, including tenant units and Air Force retirees and
their families. Public Affairs provides leaders with an arsenal of effective and efficient
communication tools to build, maintain and strengthen morale and readiness.
5.6. Courtesy Titles. Courtesy titles or conversational ranks, as appropriate, will be used in
second and later references to people in all internal information products. For example, Lt. Gen.
William J. Johnson on first reference would be referred to as General Johnson throughout the
remainder of the product or, in subsequent references, individuals can be referred to by their job
title (e.g. the maintainer) or by generic rank alone: the general, the sergeant, the senior airman,
the colonel, etc. For Airmen with specialized titles, the specialized titles will be used in
subsequent references. For example, Maj. (Dr.) John Smith will be referred to as Dr. Smith in
second and later references, and Chaplain (Maj.) Jim Smith will be referred to as Chaplain Smith
in second and later references. For civilian men, use Mr. with their last name in second and
 AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                                71


 subsequent references. For civilian women, later references are to Ms. Jones, unless the woman
 asks to be known as Miss or Mrs. -- the choice is hers, interviewers should seek her
 preference. First names are acceptable on second and subsequent references for children (ages
 17 and younger). Courtesy titles will be omitted in sports articles, unless the individual is acting
 in an official capacity in the story, and in all headlines. This policy applies to references to all
 military and civilian personnel, in all internal information products, including biographies, base
 newspapers, broadcast products and Web sites. The Associated Press style guide remains the
 standard reference for maintaining consistency and quality in Air Force newspaper and print
 news production and broadcast products. Some publications may choose to abbreviate ranks,
 rather than spelling them out, on second and subsequent references. Local style is permissible
 as long it meets the intent of using courtesy titles and ranks on second and subsequent references.
 See Figure 5.1 for suggested courtesy title use with last names on second and later references.

* For under- and assistant-secretaries, use Mr., Mrs., Ms., Miss, or Dr., as appropriate with last
name


** Do not use civilian pay grades (i.e., SES-1 or GS-12)

 5.7. Capitalization of Airman. Capitalize Airman and Airmen when referring to individuals in
 the U.S. Air Force: He is an Airman. If a generic term is needed, use the term Airmen: The
 Airmen returned to their base. This applies to all communication products including base
 newspapers, magazines, MAJCOM news services, Air Force print/TV news, Airman Magazine,
 news releases and Air Force Link. An exception is when “airman“ is part of a compound
 lower-case noun: A staff sergeant and a senior airman received awards.

 Section 5B—Newspapers

 5.8. Overview. Air Force newspapers are authorized publications that support Air Force
 command leadership communication requirements. Generally, they contain commander‟s
 comments, action line columns, letters to the editor, news, features, editorials, sports,
72                                             AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


announcements, photography and artwork. The term Air Force newspapers includes
publications in other formats, such as magazines, newsletters and electronic newspapers that
contain these categories of information. Newspapers published by Air National Guard and Air
Force Reserve Command units are Air Force newspapers. Air Force newspapers do not
necessarily reflect official views of, or endorsement of content by, the Department of the Air
Force.
5.9. Establishing Air Force Newspapers. Host commanders are encouraged to establish
civilian enterprise or funded newspapers when a valid internal information requirement exists and
when a newspaper is determined by the host commander or MAJCOM to be the most cost-
effective means of fulfilling communication requirements.
     5.9.1. An Air Force newspaper provides the commander a primary means of
     communicating mission-essential information to members of his or her command. It provides
     feedback to the commander through forums like the action line. The newspaper keeps readers
     informed about base, local community and military family-related issues and operational
     concerns. The newspaper provides a direct and documented communication channel for
     responding to base-wide concerns.
     5.9.2. News and feature stories on Air Force people and organizations provide recognition
     of excellence in performance and help establish expected norms and motivate people for
     mission accomplishment.
     5.9.3. An Air Force newspaper improves morale by helping to quell rumors and by keeping
     Air Force people accurately informed about military matters affecting their futures.
     5.9.4. The newspaper provides information to Air Force family members to improve the
     quality of their lives and thereby the effectiveness of the Air Force member.
     5.9.5. The newspaper increases command cohesiveness and effectiveness by providing a
     visual representation of the command itself.
5.10. Air Force Newspaper Categories.
     5.10.1. Civilian Enterprise (CE) newspapers are published by commercial publishers under
     contract with Air Force subordinate commands. The installation or command Public
     Affairs staff furnishes news and editorial content. CE newspapers contain advertising sold
     by the commercial publisher. The right to circulate this advertising to Air Force readers
     constitutes contractual consideration instead of money to pay for newspapers. CE
     newspapers become the property of the command or installation upon delivery according to
     terms of the contract.
     5.10.2. Funded newspapers are published by Air Force subordinate commands using
     appropriated funds. The command or installation Public Affairs staff furnishes news and
     editorial content. Funded newspapers are printed by a commercial publisher under contract,
     or with government printing equipment, according to Air Force printing regulations.
     Overseas funded newspapers may be printed under a contract with The European Stars and
     Stripes or The Pacific Stars and Stripes.
     5.10.3. Deployed newsletters and newspapers may be published during contingencies at
     deployment locations for use by component commanders.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                             73


   5.10.4. Electronic Newspapers. A newspaper published and distributed primarily by
   electronic means taking the place of a printed version. This does not include newspapers that
   are first printed and then converted to a Web-based product.
   5.10.5. Other Newsletters, Informational Bulletins and Training Publications. Newsletters,
   informational bulletins, training publications, etc., will not be printed under the provisions of
   this regulation. These publications are defined by AFI 33-360, V1, Air Force Content
   Management Program—Publications. However, this does not prohibit isolated units from
   publishing newsletters and summaries authorized by their respective MAJCOM and FOA.
5.11. Limitations. Only one Air Force newspaper is authorized for each installation.
   5.11.1. The host commander on an installation where units of more than one command are
   located is responsible for publication of one funded or CE newspaper. It will provide
   balanced coverage of all units on that installation including joint and other service units.
   Tenant units assist the host newspaper staff in covering unit activities.
   5.11.2. Under unusual circumstances, a commander other than the host may publish the
   single authorized newspaper if the host commander and a majority of tenant organizations
   concur.
       5.11.2.1. This limitation does not prohibit a command or FOA headquarters from
       publishing a newspaper for its geographically dispersed units or a Reserve Component
       unit from publishing a newspaper for its geographically dispersed people. Nor is it
       intended to prohibit a unit that has information needs that are significantly different
       from the majority of the host unit audience from publishing a separate newspaper, when
       authorized by AFNEWS, or a geographically dispersed squadron from publishing a
       newsletter for its people. Publications produced under this paragraph must follow the
       general guidelines in paragraph 5.9
5.12. Use of Funds. Appropriated funds are authorized to establish a funded newspaper, but
only if a Civilian Enterprise (CE) newspaper is not feasible.
   5.12.1. Appropriated funds may not be used to pay any part of the costs incurred by a
   commercial publisher in publishing a CE newspaper.
   5.12.2. Air Force newspapers are mission activities, and nonappropriated funds will not be
   used to defray costs of funded or CE newspaper operations. This does not preclude
   nonappropriated fund activities from buying advertising in CE newspapers to communicate
   their presence and the availability of goods and services they offer.
   5.12.3. MAJCOMs will review each funded newspaper annually to verify that continuation
   is justified and that conversion to a CE newspaper is not feasible.
5.13. Masthead Required Statements. Each Air Force newspaper must carry a masthead.
The masthead should not be placed on the front page. Each masthead must contain staff
listings and a disclaimer in type no smaller than six points.
   5.13.1. Staff Listings. The masthead of any Air Force newspaper will include the names of
   the commander and Public Affairs officer, and the names and editorial titles of the newspaper
   staff. The names and titles will be listed in a section of the masthead entitled “(name of
   installation or command) editorial staff.“ Include office address, telephone and fax numbers,
   and e-mail address. For CE papers, the names of publishers and employees of the publisher
74                                               AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


     may be listed separately. Staff listings may be printed before or immediately following the

5.14. Nameplate. Each Air Force newspaper will carry an easily identifiable front-page
nameplate (flag), including the name of the newspaper, volume and issue numbers,
geographical location (unless classified), name of command or installation and publication date.
   5.14.1. Trademarking. Installations, commands, FOAs and DRUs are encouraged to
   trademark the names of their newspapers. By trademarking the publication name, units
   ensure the name will not be used by an organization other than theirs, including civilian
   enterprises. To register on a state level, Public Affairs officers work through the local Staff
   Judge Advocates. To register at the federal level, contact SAF/GCQ, Washington DC
   20324-1000, for assistance. Guidance for obtaining funds to pay registration fees is in
   Defense Finance and Accounting Service Regulation DFAS-DE 7010.2-R, Commercial
   Transactions at Base Level.
5.15. Newspaper Staff. Only the highest quality people should be assigned to an Air Force
newspaper. Because publishing schedules are fixed and copy deadlines must be met by
contract, newspaper staff members assigned responsibility for meeting these deadlines are
excused from duties that interfere with newspaper production. To aid in the gathering of news,
Air Force editors should, as needed, utilize the unit Public Affairs representative (UPAR)
program.
5.16. Assistance to Editors. Air Force editors have many resources outside their office to
turn to for help. Air Force News Service (AFNEWS), MAJCOMs and the Defense Information
School offer guidance and assistance. Resources available on the Internet include the Air Force
Newspaper Primer at http://www.afnews.af.mil/products/primer.htm Most MAJCOM/PA
Web sites also have sections for newspaper staff members.
   5.16.1. MAJCOMs should consider scheduling annual newspaper editor workshops or
   conferences to assist editors in communicating commanders‟ messages. AFNEWS is
   available to assist MAJCOMs upon request.
   5.16.2. Editors are encouraged to network with fellow editors for ideas, suggestions and
   recommendations to improve story quality, layout and design, photography, production
   schedule and commander‟s involvement.
   5.16.3. Editors and journalists are encouraged to attend the annual Air Force Journalists‟
   Workshop hosted by AFNEWS. Information on the workshop is distributed by AFNEWS
   each year through MAJCOM newspaper consultants and to DRUs, FOAs and others.
5.17. General Policies for All Newspapers. Department of the Air Force policy is that a
free flow of news and information will be provided to all Air Force members. The intended
audience of Air Force newspapers consists of military members (active duty, Guard and
Reserve), civilian employees assigned to the installation, military retirees, and their families.
   5.17.1. National security information will be protected according to DODD 5200.1, DOD
   Information Security Program, and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
   Management.

      5.17.4. Air Force newspapers will establish editorial policies to ensure consistency and
      support the commander‟s internal information objectives. (See Figure 5.2, Sample Editorial
      Policy Letter.)
      5.17.5. Air Force newspapers will comply with AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, and
      guidelines for release of information in Chapter 6, Media Operations.
      5.17.6. Air Force members and Air Force civilian employees will not be assigned to duty on
      the premises of a commercial publisher to perform any job function that is part of the
      business activities or contractual responsibilities of the publisher. The Public Affairs officer
      and staff members who produce editorial content may work on the premises as liaison to
      specify and coordinate layout and other details of production provided for in the contract
      with the publisher.
      5.17.7. All personnel must maintain currency on the provisions of DOD 5500.7-R, Joint
      Ethics Regulation. For example, Air Force personnel must not accept employment by or
      gratuities from commercial printers under contract to print funded newspapers, nor from a
      commercial publisher under CE contract with an installation or MAJCOM. Personnel of the
      command or installation must not be connected with the business affairs of the CE
      newspaper or other business affairs of commercial publishers under contract. Inspection of
      the business capability of prospective publishing companies during the bidding process and
      general monitoring of ongoing business capability to fulfill the contract is not a violation of
      this paragraph.
      5.17.8. At least one qualified senior member of the Public Affairs staff will review all
      editorial content before publication.
      5.17.9. Equipment owned by the civilian publisher or printer may be placed in the installation
      or command Public Affairs office by the publisher to enable the newspaper staff to prepare
      editorial materials and specify layout. For CE newspapers, the civilian publisher bears
      all costs of this equipment. Employees of a CE publisher may work in the installation or
      command Public Affairs office. The publisher will provide all required equipment for its
      employees.
      5.17.10. No Air Force newspaper will subscribe, even at no cost, to a commercial or feature
      service whose primary purpose is the advertising or promotion of commercial products,
      commodities or services.
      5.17.11. Weekly newspapers will be published 50 times each year unless local conditions
      require otherwise (i.e., the publisher closes down for three weeks each year). For those
      exceptions, request a waiver from AFNEWS through the major command.

(Name of Paper) Editorial Policy Statement
The (name of paper) is an authorized publication supporting the (name of unit, base)
internal communications program.
The (name of paper) is published by a commercial publisher under contract with the Air Force.
News and editorial content are furnished by the (name of unit) Public Affairs Office. The
newspaper contains advertising sold by the commercial publisher. The right to circulate this
 AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                                  77


advertising to Air Force readers constitutes contractual considerations instead of money to pay
for the newspaper. The (name of paper) becomes property of the commander upon delivery,
according to the terms of the contract.
The (name of paper) is the commander‟s primary communication tool to transmit information
to the
(name of installation) community. The following editorial policy guidelines apply to achieve this
goal:
1. The (name of paper) provides the commander a primary means of communicating mission-
essential information to members of the organization. The commander, (name of unit),
normally defers all decisions on news propriety, story placement, publication date, and use of
photography to the Public Affairs officer.
2. News and feature stories on (name of unit) people and organizations provide recognition of
excellence in performance and help set forth norms for mission accomplishment.
3. News coverage and content will conform to policies of the Air Force and the commander.
News reporting will be factual and objective. News coverage will avoid morbid, sensational or
alarming details not necessary to factual news reporting. News writing will distinguish between
fact and opinion. When an opinion is expressed, the source will be identified. The (name of
paper) will not publish commercial news or editorials.
4. The (name of paper) will keep the community accurately informed about military matters
affecting their futures. This will assist the commander in improving morale and quelling rumors.
5. (Name of paper) news and editorial content will provide information to all members of the
(name of base/unit) community to improve the quality of their lives and thereby the effectiveness
of the (name of unit) work force. This includes officers, enlisted members, civilian employees,
family members, retirees, and Reservists and Guardsmen.
6. The (name of paper) will de-glamorize the use of alcohol and tobacco products. Articles
concerning the club, unit, or other activities may mention these products as long as the emphasis
is on the activities and not the products.
7. The appearance of advertising in the (name of paper) does not constitute endorsement by
the Air Force. Everything advertised in the (name of paper) must be made available to all readers
without regard to race, religion, sex, national origin, marital status, physical handicap, political
affiliation or any other non-merit factor.
8. Because publishing schedules are fixed by contract and must be met, the (name of paper)
staff is excused from additional duties that interfere with newspaper production.
9. The (name of paper) will conform to applicable regulations and IAWs relating to libel and
copyright, the Air Force Privacy Act Program and Standards of Conduct, as well as U.S.
Government printing and postal regulations.

10. Locally originated articles will reflect the policies of the commander and be in the interest of
the Air Force. Editorials should help readers understand Air Force policies and programs. They
must not imply criticism of other government agencies, nor advocate or dispute specific
political, diplomatic, or legislative matters. Statements or articles on legislative matters by
people or agencies outside the DOD, including officials or candidates for public office, will not
be used.

Specific Publication Guidelines
Deadline: Due to printing and copy deadlines set by contract with the commercial publisher,
copy submitted to the (name of paper) must reach the editor‟s desk before (time and day) of
the week of publication.
Rewrite: All copy submitted to the (name of paper) will be rewritten as needed to ensure it
conforms to Air Force journalism guidelines for news writing. This includes conforming to
the guidelines in the Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media IAW and appropriate
story length to facilitate layout and design.
Placement: The (name of unit) commander normally defers all decisions on story placement
to the Public Affairs officer. The commander--not the person who submits an article--gives
direction on story placement to the PAO.
Recurring Columns: Recurring columns from base agencies will be discouraged. This will
ensure that no base agency or organization receives an excessive amount of coverage for its
special interest at the expense of other base agencies. The Public Affairs officer will determine
equitable space for these items and allocate news, feature, or editorial space as deemed
appropriate.
Award Winners: Stories and/or photos are limited to                  -level and higher. Awards
below wing level may be mentioned in a regular (news or spotlight) column and published on a
space-available basis.
Change of Command: Stories and/or photos are limited to                  -level or major tenant
organizations. Squadron-level change of command announcements may be published in the
“news briefs“ column.
Photos: On-the-job action photos will be published. Photos unacceptable for publication
include the posed shot of a person receiving an award, ribbon cuttings, posed group photos,
photos containing alcoholic beverages or cigarettes, retirement/reenlistment photos, photos
containing controlled area badges, photos of people not conforming to AFI 36-2903, Dress and
Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, or poor quality photos.
Fund Drives: Coverage will be limited to those campaigns authorized by Air Force regulations,
namely the Combined Federal Campaign and the Air Force Assistance Fund. Front-page
coverage is not guaranteed for any fund drive or membership campaign. News during a given
week determines story placement on Page 1. The Public Affairs officer will coordinate with
the fund drive key personnel to ensure appropriate coverage of these events.
Coordination: (Name of paper) articles will be coordinated with affected agencies as
deemed appropriate by the Public Affairs officer. Controversial or “sensitive“ articles will be
coordinated with the commander, and higher headquarters, when necessary, before publication.
Changes to style or news writing will only by made when directed by the Public Affairs officer.

     5.18.1.2. News content is based on local articles developed by the newspaper staff and
     releases by Air Force Print News, MAJCOM news services, American Forces Press
     Service, and other agencies of the DOD and federal government.
     5.18.1.3. Articles of local interest to base people produced outside official channels
     (e.g. stringers, local organizations) may be used provided permission has been obtained,
     the source is credited and they do not otherwise violate this instruction. Articles
     for off-base, non-profit organizations, including non-profit military-affiliated
     organizations (e.g., Air Force Association, Air Force Sergeants Association, NCO
     Association, etc.) must be consistent in length and placement to avoid the appearance of
     favoritism or implied endorsement.
     5.18.1.4. News, feature and editorial material will conform to policies of the Air Force
     and the commander. Coverage will be factual and objective and avoid morbid,
     sensational, or alarming details not essential to factual reporting. Accuracy is
     paramount.
     5.18.1.5. Air Force publications will distinguish between facts and opinion, both of
     which may be part of a news, feature or sports story. When an opinion is expressed,
     identify the person or source.

     must not imply criticism of other governmental agencies, nor advocate or dispute specific
     political, diplomatic, or legislative matters.
     5.18.1.7. Air Force newspapers will credit sources of all material other than local,
     internal sources. This includes, but is not limited to, Air Force Print News, American
     Forces Press Service, and other DOD component and MAJCOM news services.
     5.18.1.8. Overseas newspapers will obtain guidance concerning host country
     sensitivities from their respective combatant commands.
     5.18.1.9. Unsolicited statements or articles on legislative matters by people or agencies
     outside the DOD, including officials or candidates for public office, are not used.
     5.18.1.10. Air Force newspapers do not use commercial news, cartoons or opinion
     material. Such material is outside the purpose of Air Force newspapers and would place
     them in direct competition with commercial newspapers. Use of such material may be
     authorized by AFNEWS in a specific situation where other sources of national and
     international news are not available.
     5.18.1.11. Individuals to be interviewed and photographed must meet all requirements
     of AFI36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, and must
     comply with current safety, security and technical order requirements.
     5.18.1.12. Adhere to guidelines in Chapter 6, Media Operations, on release of

        collection, processing, storage, use, publication and distribution of information by DOD
        components (e.g., libel, photographic imaging alteration, copyright, sexually explicit
        materials, classified information) and U.S. Government postal and printing regulations.
        5.18.1.14. The use of For Official Use information, such as Commander‟s Notice to
        Airmen (NOTAMs), is restricted without prior approval by MAJCOM.
     5.18.2. Commercial sponsorship and products.
        5.18.2.1. Newspapers do not contain any material that implies Air Force units or
        members endorse or favor a specific commercial product, commodity or service.
        5.18.2.2. Commercial sponsors are mentioned only with other pertinent facts in news
        stories and announcements. Commercial logos are not allowed unless part of a paid
        advertisement. Names of commercial sponsors cannot be placed in the headline or the
        lead.
        5.18.2.3. News articles mentioning gifts from civilian sources tied to Air Force
        programs honoring Airmen of the month, top recruiter, and the like are used only when
        intent of the article is to report on an Air Force individual honored for professional
        achievement. The fact a special gift has been donated to the Air Force will be of
        secondary consideration or not mentioned. Special concessions or privileges must not
        have been granted the donor, such as a requirement to accompany the article with a
        photograph of the recipient with the gift, or to publish a statement that implies
        endorsement of the product or organization by the Air Force or the individual.
        Photographs of the recipient with the product are allowed, but must be used based solely
        on news value.
        5.18.2.4. Book, radio, television, movie and other entertainment reviews are written
        objectively, and there is no implication of endorsement by the Department of the Air
        Force.
     5.18.3. Political campaigns and voting.
        5.18.3.1. Political campaign news items, advertisements, or editorials dealing with
        candidates or issues are not used.
        5.18.3.2. The newspaper supports the Federal Voting Assistance Program during election
        years by carrying factual information about registration and voting IAWs, especially
        about absentee voting requirements. Voting materials provided by the director of the
        Federal Voting Assistance Program, DOD and the Air Force are designed to encourage
        members to register as voters and exercise their right to vote.
        5.18.3.3. No poll, survey or straw vote relating to a political campaign is conducted or
        reported.
     5.18.4. Inspection ratings.
        5.18.4.1. Operational Readiness Inspections. ORIs are conducted to evaluate the ability
        of units with a wartime or contingency mission to perform assigned operational
        missions. A five-tier rating system (consisting of outstanding, excellent, satisfactory,
        marginal and unsatisfactory) is used for major graded areas (consisting of initial response,
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                          81


       employment, mission support, and ability to survive and operate) and overall wing
       performance. Summary inspection results may be published in the base paper and
       external media. Wing-level Public Affairs offices must consult with their respective
       MAJCOM Public Affairs for specific publication criteria as release of ORI reports are at
       the discretion of the respective MAJCOM/IG. When in doubt, AFI 90-201, Inspector
       General Activities, takes precedence. Commanders will ensure all personnel safeguard
       the privileged nature of inspection reports.
       5.18.4.2. Compliance Inspections. Compliance inspections are conducted to assess
       areas mandated by IAW as well as mission areas identified by senior Air Force and
       MAJCOM leadership as critical or important to assess the health and performance of the
       organization. A three-tier grading system (consisting of in compliance, in compliance
       with comments, and not in compliance) is typically used. Wing-level Public Affairs
       offices must consult with their respective MAJCOM Public Affairs office for specific
       publication criteria as release of CI reports is at the discretion of the respective
       MAJCOM/IG. Commanders will ensure all personnel safeguard the privileged nature of
       inspection reports.
       5.18.4.3. Nuclear Inspections. For Nuclear Surety Inspections and Defense Agency
       Inspections, no public or non-public release of scores or data is authorized beyond that
       required in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities.
5.19. Readership Surveys. A newspaper readership survey should be conducted at a frequency
deemed necessary by the installation commander to meet his or her needs and those of readers.
The Air Force has approved a standardized Base Newspaper Readership Survey that may be
updated and tailored to meet the needs of each installation. This survey may be administered
to active-duty military, family members, retirees, and civilian employees of the Air Force
without need for additional Air Force Personnel Center or AFNEWS approval, provided
questions are not altered significantly. The Air Force Newspaper Survey is available online at
http://www.afnews.af.mil/internal/survey/survey_index.htm. Each MAJCOM and FOA
Public Affairs office should have additional guidelines for administering it in hard copy and
electronically via the Web-based version. Survey results should be reported to readers and
used to develop new newspaper services or techniques.
5.20. Records. Public Affairs offices will maintain record copies of Air Force newspapers they
produce in annual blocks, with new files starting on 1 January or on the anniversary of the first
issue. These may be permanently bound or microfilmed. Microfilmed source documents may be
discarded after the microfilmed copy is confirmed complete and accurate. Maintain and dispose
of microfilmed copies in accordance with AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records and
disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://webrims.amc.af.mil. Public Affairs offices should maintain at least 10 other copies of
each issue for one year.
5.21. Policies and Procedures for CE Newspapers. The CE concept is based on the premise
Air Force installations will save money by transferring certain publishing and distribution costs
and responsibilities to a commercial publisher selected by competitive bid. The essence of the
contract between installation and publisher is an exchange of rights as consideration, rather
than payment of funds. The right to sell and circulate advertising to the complete readership of
the CE newspaper provides the publisher revenue to cover costs and secure earnings.

     5.21.1. Contract Procedures.
        5.21.1.1. The contracting Air Force organization guarantees first publication and
        distribution rights of the editorial content written locally, specifically for the newspaper.
        5.21.1.2. The newspaper becomes the property of the command, installation or
        intended reader upon delivery.
        5.21.1.3. In negotiating contracts, seek to have the publisher perform as many of the
        publishing functions, including desktop publishing, layout and distribution, as possible to
        generate maximum savings. Command communication needs and requirements are of
        paramount consideration.
        5.21.1.4. Contracts must be with reputable firms.
        5.21.1.5. In selecting a publisher, fair and equal treatment must be given to any
        responsible, qualified bidder. Advertise for proposals from the widest possible selection
        of commercial publishers available.
        5.21.1.6. A requests for proposal (RFP) must include a statement of work giving a
        general description of the scope of the proposed contract, including the name and nature
        of the publication involved; must describe editorial content to be carried, e.g. news,
        features, factual information, and, if applicable, comics to be carried; and other required
        provisions of the contract. The Public Affairs officer must assist the installation
        contracting officer in preparing the RFP and ensure it is coordinated with the MAJCOM
        before submitting it to prospective offerors.
        5.21.1.7. RFPs must include a description of contractor-owned or furnished equipment
        necessary to coordinate newspaper production.
        5.21.1.8. RFPs may include a description of contractor-furnished editorial support
        services. The description must be on terms of the end product required; e.g.
        photographic services or reporter services, and not as a requirement for certain contractor
        personnel.
        5.21.1.9. RFPs may include a request for a Services supplement. As part of the contract,
        the publisher must produce the supplement at no cost to Air Force Services or the Air
        Force. In exchange for this service, the publisher may circulate advertising solicited to
        Air Force readers on base. The publisher uses the revenue generated by ad sales to
        produce the newspaper and supplement. Only at overseas installations can Air Force
        Services supplements be inserted into funded newspapers; that supplement may not
        contain advertising.
            5.21.1.9.1. Specify whether Services or Public Affairs is responsible for the content,
            design, and layout of the supplement.
            5.21.1.9.2. Include a provision stating that Services may not offer commercial
            sponsors free advertising in the Services supplement or other areas of the newspaper.
            This does not prevent commercial sponsors from purchasing advertisements from the
            publisher, nor does it prevent Services from mentioning sponsors along with other
            pertinent facts in articles or announcements.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           83


            5.21.1.9.3. State specifics about the supplement. These specifics include details such
            as size, frequency, advertising ratios and use of color.
            5.21.1.9.4. A statement on the front page of the supplement that reads, “Supplement
            to (name of paper)“ is mandatory. Supplements must also carry the disclaimer
            listed in paragraph
  5.13.3.
     5.21.1.10. RFPs will contain a description of the publisher‟s responsibility for
     distributing the publication. This provision must address such matters as the
     contractor furnishing news racks along with contractor responsibilities for maintaining
     those racks. Seek to have the publisher provide bulk wrapping and distribution to
     units deployed for more than 45 days by the most cost-effective means possible.
     5.21.1.11. RFPs must state the commander or Public Affairs officer will specify design
     and layout of editorial content. Contracts may provide for the commander or Public
     Affairs officer to specify advertising layout to enhance communication effectiveness.
     5.21.1.12. Contracts may include up to a two-year base period, with options for one- or
     two-year renewal periods--based on satisfactory performance--for a total of up to six
     years. After the maximum of six years, rebid contracts. Contracts must contain a
     provision for termination for cause whenever the products or services to be provided
     become unsatisfactory or when contract provisions are not met.               Document
     unsatisfactory performance and give a copy to the publisher, contracting office and
     installation commander. Contracts must also include a provision for termination
     for convenience of the government.
     5.21.1.13. The contract will contain a provision stating that the publisher shall not be
     required to pay money to the command or installation, or to provide goods, services, or
     considerations not directly related to the CE newspaper.
     5.21.1.14. The contract will contain a provision stating any changes to the statement of
     work or other terms and conditions shall be made by written contract modification
     between the publisher and the installation contracting office.
     5.21.1.15. A selection group picks a civilian publisher. The chairperson will be a senior
     member of the command or activity. Membership will include Public Affairs,
     contracting, legal and other specialists with skills relevant to the selection and
     contracting process. The contracting officer shall execute the contract according to
     applicable directives. This group reviews written data from prospective civilian
     publishing firms, secures and reviews independent data, and if necessary, hears
     presentations from firms and makes on-site visits to gather information upon which to
     make a selection.       Members investigate the competence, reliability, technical
     production, and business capabilities and resources of each offer before making a
     selection. The group also conducts reviews to decide on annual contract option
     renewals and terminations for cause.
     5.21.1.16. Since exchange of rights is the consideration in a CE contract, the best
     obtainable product and service in exchange for those rights is the primary criteria for
84                                              AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


        selection. Other criteria include the competence, reliability and responsibility of
        prospective publishers.
        5.21.1.17. If there is only one offeror, the selection group may decide to make no
        selection.
     5.21.2. Advertising Procedures.
        5.21.2.1. In reviewing offers and negotiating contracts, the amount of advertising that
        allows the publisher to publish and still make a reasonable profit must be considered. All
        contracts will specify ground rules including the amount of advertising in the
        newspaper. Advertising may be (1) “run of publication” (ROP), e.g. printed in sections
        within the publication; (2) included in supplements printed with the publication; (3)
        preprinted and inserted as an advertising “insert“ or “flier;” or (4) may be a combination
        of these methods.
        5.21.2.2. Contracts will contain a provision stating that supplements containing
        material other than, or in addition to, advertising, will carry the name of the CE
        publication. These supplements are not necessarily preprinted. See paragraph 5.13.3 for
        more details. In addition, advertisements to be published as part of the supplement will
        be reviewed by the Public Affairs staff before they are printed to identify any that are
        contrary to IAW or Air Force regulations, or that may pose a danger or detriment to Air
        Force members or their families, or interfere or detract from the command or installation
        mission.
        5.21.2.3. Advertising inserts or fliers, which contain advertising only, do not
        require prior approval of the commander; however, they are to be reviewed by the
        Public Affairs staff as stated in paragraph 5.21.2.9
        5.21.2.4. Contracts must contain a provision prohibiting the publisher from selling an
        amount of advertising that would force the Public Affairs staff to produce editorial
        content exceeding mission needs. The average quarterly ratio of ROP advertising to
        editorial copy in CE newspapers will not exceed 60 percent advertising. Advertising
        inserts and advertising supplements, including classified ad supplements, will not count
        in the total advertising-to-copy ratio. Classified-ad sections in the ROP that offer free
        ads to military members and their families are counted as editorial content, but classified-
        ad sections in the ROP that contain only paid ads are counted as advertising space in the
        ratio.
        5.21.2.5. Contracts must contain a provision stating the newspaper will not carry any
        advertisement that implies discrimination or religious intolerance. According to
        AFPD 36-27, Social Actions, it is Air Force policy to conduct its affairs free from
        unIAWful discrimination and sexual harassment.
        5.21.2.6. Contracts must contain a provision stating newspapers will not carry paid
        political advertisements. Coordinate advertisements about union activities with the
        installation civilian personnel labor relations office and the Staff Judge Advocate for
        propriety. Advertisements must not be worded to give the impression the Air Force
        endorses or sponsors their content in any way. Advertisements about union elections
        will be limited to names of candidates, offices sought, platforms, union positions held,
        and places and times members may vote.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         85


     5.21.2.7. Contracts must contain a provision stating newspapers will not carry
     advertisements for bingo games or lotteries conducted by a commercial organization
     whose main business is conducting lotteries.
     5.21.2.8. All contracts will contain a provision prohibiting publishers from entering into
     exclusive advertising agreements with any firm, broker or individual.
     5.21.2.9. Contracts will contain a provision stating that before each edition of a CE
     newspaper is printed, the Public Affairs staff will review advertisements to identify any
     contrary to IAW or Air Force regulations, or that may pose a danger or detriment to Air
     Force members or their families, or interfere with or detract from the command or
     installation mission. The contract will specify the Public Affairs officer may request the
     publisher change or delete them. If a contractor insists on publishing base newspapers
     containing offensive advertisements, the installation commander, in consultation with
     the Public Affairs officer, may prohibit distribution. An installation commander
     should make every effort to negotiate the removal of the ads before banning distribution of
     the publication.
     5.21.2.10. The installation commander has the authority to prohibit distribution of a CE
     newspaper containing advertising that promotes a situation involving potential riots or
     other disturbances, or when the circulation of such advertising may present a danger to
     loyalty, discipline, or morale of his or her people. Each commander determines whether
     particular advertisements placed by the publisher in a command or installation CE
     newspaper interfere with successful mission performance. Considerations include the
     local situation, content of the proposed advertisement, and identity and reputation of
     the advertiser.
     5.21.2.11. The contract will specify the publisher will not accept advertisements from
     any establishments placed “off limits“ by the installation commander.
     5.21.2.12. Contracts will state that advertisements that appear to be editorials, news,
     feature stories, Air Force photographs, or line art must be clearly labeled “advertisement“
     in a type size equal to newspaper body type, or larger.
     5.21.2.13. All contracts must state that neither the publisher nor his or her
     representative shall solicit advertisements in the name of the installation or command.
     In addition, the contract will state that active-duty Air Force military members and
     civilian employees are prohibited from soliciting or endorsing advertisements. The
     contract will also state that the publisher shall not accept for publication advertisements
     that are worded or phrased to give the reader the impression that the Air Force in any way
     endorses, guarantees or sponsors any product or service.
     5.21.2.14. Advertisers are expected to observe the highest business ethics and applicable
     IAWs in describing goods, services, and commodities, including guarantees, warranties,
     and terms of sale, if any. If credit terms are offered, the advertisement must contain
     sufficient information for readers to make a reasonable estimate of the total cost of the
     credit. The purpose of this disclosure policy is to minimize deception, whether intended
     or not, and to equip readers with information with which they can shop comparatively.
     Federal and State IAWs, including those prohibiting false, misleading, or deceptive
     advertising, must be observed. Public Affairs officers should consult the Staff Judge
 86                                                AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


           Advocate any time they find reason to question an advertisement proposed for inclusion
           in the installation newspaper.
           5.21.2.15. While the editorial content of CE newspapers is written and controlled by
           installation commanders, the advertising is the responsibility of CE publishers.
           Procedurally, publishers must decide on their own whether or not to accept and run
           particular advertisements. Any decision by a publisher not to run an advertisement is
           final.
           5.21.2.16. CE newspapers may carry paid or nonpaid advertising of the products and
           services of nonappropriated fund activities and commissaries, but item-by-item price
           comparisons to those on the civilian economy will not be made.
      5.21.3. Local Procedures.
           5.21.3.1. The contract with the selected commercial publisher must include provisions
           that reflect appropriate guidance from this instruction, specifically, those stated in
           paragraphs 5.21.1 and
      5.21.2. Use the standardized sample request for proposal/contract (Figure 5.3); sample RFP
      statement of work newspaper contract (Figure 5.4.); and sample award evaluation (Figure
      5.5.) as a guide.
           5.21.3.2. Provisions may be added to meet command and local requirements, but make
           sure that they do not conflict with the required provisions in paragraphs 5.21.1 and 5.21.2,
           and do not refer to the Federal Acquisition Regulation or its supplements.

 Figure 5.5. Sample RFP Award Evaluation.

1. Contract Award:
a. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror
                                            Telephone Number
whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. The
criteria and the procedures the Government will use for evaluation of proposals and source
selection are described in this solicitation.
b. The Government may award a contract on the basis of initial offers received without
 AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                                 93


discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the publisher‟s best terms from the
ability to meet the selection criteria and provide the Government the best possible service and
product.
2. Selection Criteria. The selection group will review the written data and may hear presentations
by the offerors who responded to the request for proposal. An on-site visit of the contractor‟s
plant may be conducted to determine the ability to perform. Since exchange of rights constitutes
the consideration in a civilian enterprise publication contract, the best obtainable product and
service in exchange for those rights shall be the primary criteria for selection. General elements
the selection group will evaluate for:
a. Capability; quality of photo reproduction, color and black and white; variety of type fonts and
screens available; quality of paper stock; availability of spot color on request.
b. Convenience of communication between the publisher and the Public Affairs office. Distance,
use of computer equipment, ease of communication (not applicable to guides, maps and pocket
guides).
c. Ability to meet the contract requirements, current workload, number of copies to be
delivered and ability to deliver the paper on time, ability to meet or beat deadlines established
in the contract with respect to other work.
d. Experience, past performance, particular experience in publishing this type of publication,
evidence of quality workmanship.
e. Services that are proposed beyond or in addition to those required in the solicitation. f. (List
any other items your installation wishes to consider.)
(Order the criteria in descending order of importance in the request for proposal. While exact
scoring should not be revealed to unsuccessful offerors, each installation should be able to tell
those publishers in general terms where their proposals were deficient.)

 5.22. Funded Newspapers Policies and Procedures. Normally, a funded Air Force
 newspaper is printed by a civilian printer under contract, or in government printing facilities,
 according to Air Force regulations. Cost is the primary constraint with funded papers. Work
 closely with Defense Printing Service to determine requirements and sources. Editorial content
 and distribution are provided by the installation or MAJCOM. Overseas, funded newspapers are
 authorized to be printed under contract with The European or Pacific Stars and Stripes.
     5.22.1. The contract for printing a funded newspaper should be handled according to the
     Air Force Supplement to DODD 5330.3, Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS), with
     Public Affairs as the office of primary interest.
     5.22.2. Number of copies. The established publication ratio is one copy for every three
     intended readers. Intended readers are military members (active duty, Guard and
     Reserve), Air Force civilian employees, retirees, and their families. Specific justification
     for more copies must be submitted with your annual budget.
     5.22.3. Armed Forces Day or open house issues may be printed with up to twice the normal
     number of pages and up to twice the normal number of copies.
94                                              AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


     5.22.4. The number of copies may be increased to a one-to-one ratio in support of the
     INTRO Program (to welcome newcomers), family support centers, or base housing delivery.
     5.22.5. Color. Printing in two or more colors generally increases costs. Spot color in small
     areas of the page may be used as a means of adding emphasis or displaying information
     graphically if it contributes toward effective communication.
     5.22.6. Use of full (process) color for the reproduction of photographs, paintings, or
     illustrations is authorized on an occasional basis--such as U.S. holidays--to enhance
     effective communication, emphasize traditional holidays and values, and help improve
     morale.
     5.22.7. Provisions for additional color or full color must be included in annual budget
     requests.
     5.22.8. Funded newspapers must not be printed on paper stock heavier than 50-pound
     offset book (weight basis 25x38 inches--500 sheets), JCP Specification A60.
     5.22.9. Funded newspapers will not carry commercial advertising but, as a service, may
     carry nonpaid listings of personal items and services for sale by members of the command.
     5.22.10. Noncommercial news stories and announcements concerning nonappropriated
     fund activities and commissaries may be published.
     5.22.11. During contingencies, newsletters or newspapers may be published at deployment
     locations for use by component commanders.
5.23. Distribution of Newspapers.
     5.23.1. A funded newspaper will not be distributed as an insert to a CE newspaper, nor a CE
     newspaper be distributed as an insert to a funded newspaper.
     5.23.2. Comic and feature supplements may be inserted into and distributed with a CE
     newspaper with the approval of the contracting officer or his or her authorized
     representative. Supplements with commercial advertising must provide fair and equal
     opportunity to responsible people, businesses, or organizations to compete for this privilege,
     and the front page of the supplement carries the disclaimer prescribed in paragraph 5.13.3
     5.23.3. CE and funded newspapers may be distributed through official channels,
     including use of government transportation, as necessary.
     5.23.4. The publisher of a CE newspaper will make as much of the distribution to the
     intended readership as possible in meeting the contractual requirement to generate maximum
     savings for the installation. Distribution should include installation housing areas,
     where possible. See paragraph
        5.21.1.14.
     5.23.5. The commander may designate selective and controlled off-base distribution to
     members of the intended audience where on-base distribution to them would be otherwise
     impossible or impractical. High-density military off-base housing areas such as a mobile
     home community would be an example; commercial establishments such as a shopping mall
     would not qualify.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         95


   5.23.6. The publisher of a CE newspaper may charge a reasonable postage and handling fee
   for mailing issues to segments of the newspaper‟s audience such as retirees who are
   outside the local area. Each request must be approved by the Public Affairs officer, who will
   maintain a mailing list of those individuals. The Public Affairs officer will periodically
   review and update the mailing list to ensure those receiving the publication are doing so in
   the best interest of the Air Force.
   5.23.7. Except as authorized by MAJCOMs or AFNEWS for special situations or occasions
   such as an installation open house, base newspapers will not be distributed outside the
   intended Air Force audience. The publisher of a CE newspaper is not authorized to sell
   copies of the newspaper, either individually or through subscriptions, to persons outside the
   intended audience. The publisher may provide an advertiser with a copy of a newspaper
   containing his or her paid advertising.
   5.23.8. On publication date, send at least two copies of each newspaper to the major
   command and two copies to AFNEWS, 203 Norton Street, San Antonio TX 78226-1848. In
   place of the copies to AFNEWS, an electronic copy in the A dobe PDF format
   may be emailed to newspaper@afnews.af.mil.
5.24. Mailing Newspapers. Air Force policy is to keep mailing costs to a minimum,
consistent with timeliness and applicable postal regulations (see the Air Force Supplement to
DOD 4525.8M, DOD Official Mail Manual). DOD official postage includes all means of
paying postage with funds appropriated for DOD. In the case of the Air Force, these include
payment by regular postage stamps, commercial postage meters, or other means available to the
private sector such as mailers to transact U.S. Postal Service business. Also send one copy to
Defense Information School, Attn: Public Affairs Department, Room 2150, 6500 Mapes
Road, Fort Meade, MD, 20755-6500.
   5.24.1. Use DOD official postage only for mailing:
       5.24.1.1. Copies to satisfy mandatory distribution requirements.
       5.24.1.2. Copies to other Public Affairs offices for administrative purposes.
       5.24.1.3. Copies to headquarters in the chain of command.

       members.
       5.24.1.5. Information copies to other U.S. government agencies, members of the
       Congress, libraries, hospitals, schools and depositories.
       5.24.1.6. Individual copy in response to an unsolicited request from a private person,
       firm, or organization, if such response is in the best interest of the Air Force,
       MAJCOM, FOA, DRU or installation.
       5.24.1.7. Copies to incoming Air Force members and their families to orient them to
       their new command, installation and community.
   5.24.2. Do not use DOD official postage for mailing to the general readership or by the CE
   publisher. However, when unit funds are available, official mail may be used to mail Guard
   and Reserve newspapers to the home address of individual unit members.
96                                               AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


     5.24.3. Generally, mail Air Force newspapers as controlled circulation, third-class bulk, third
     class or fourth class.
     5.24.4. The mailing of base newspapers will comply with current 18 U.S. Code 1302 and
     1307 directives as they pertain to the mailing of advertisements and material related to
     lotteries and other games of chance. Postal officials can provide current guidance.
     5.24.5. Annual review. Review mailing and distribution lists annually to determine
     distribution effectiveness and continuing need of each recipient to receive the publication.
     Annually, revalidate distribution techniques, target audiences, readers-per-copy ratios, and
     use of postal facilities to ensure the most economical use of mail services consistent with
     timeliness.
5.25. Report Requirements. Changes to the name, method of financing, frequency or size
of an Air Force newspaper will be reported to AFNEWS when a change occurs. Additionally,
each Public Affairs office having a newspaper will prepare a Public Affairs Program Report
(RCS: SAF/PA (A) 7101), covering the period 1 January through 31 December, and send to the
MAJCOM or FOA, which collects them and sends them to AFNEWS by 31 January. Include in
each report:
     5.25.1. Name of newspaper, unit or base served and mailing address.
     5.25.2. Major command.
     5.25.3. Printing arrangement. (Type 1 for a funded newspaper printed by the government,
     Type 2 for a funded newspaper printed by a contractor, Type 3 for a CE newspaper. If Type
     3, include the publisher‟s name, address and telephone number.)
     5.25.4. Automation capabilities (desktop publishing, Web site address if on the Web,
     computer bulletin board, etc.).
     5.25.5. Frequency and number of issues per year, and the publication day if weekly or
     publication date if monthly.

5.26. Non-DOD Publications. Commanders may allow reputable publishers of non-DOD
publications to sell or give away their publications at specified locations on base, except as
prohibited by AFI 51-903, Dissident and Protest Activities. These publications may not be
distributed through official channels.

Section S—C—Other Civilian Enterprise Publications

5.27. Base Guides or Maps. These are optional authorized publications containing advertising
prepared and published under contract with civilian publishers. Public Affairs should consider
the availability of information on Web sites and other sources when considering the necessity of
producing an optional publication. As with CE newspapers, the right to circulate this advertising
to the Air Force readership constitutes contractual consideration instead of money to pay for the
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                          97


publications. They become the property of the command, installation or intended recipient upon
delivery according to contract terms. These publications are limited to:
   5.27.1. Installation guides, which provide Air Force people information about the mission
   of their command; command, installation, or community services available; local geography
   and history; and related information. CE installation guides may contain a telephone
   directory section, in accordance with paragraph 5.28.3.2
   5.27.2. Installation maps, which are designed to help orient new arrivals or visitors. As a
   force protection measure, specific addresses should not be included
5.28. Establishing Other CE Publications. When valid communication requirements
exist, a commander may establish CE publications other than newspapers. Exercise care not to
overburden community advertisers. Only one publication in each category is authorized for
each installation. MAJCOMs approve installation publications in these categories. AFNEWS
approves MAJCOM and FOA publications. The standardized sample request for
proposal/contract (Figure 5.3); sample RFP award evaluation (Figure 5.5); and sample
statement of work for a guide or map contract (Figure 5.6) should be followed in contracting for
CE publications other than newspapers. Additional provisions may be added to meet command
and local requirements, but they must not conflict with provisions listed in paragraphs 5.21.1
and 5.21.2 and will not refer to the Federal Acquisition Regulation or its supplements.
   5.28.1. Policies and procedures. The policies, procedures and restrictions established for CE
   newspapers generally apply to CE publications other than newspapers.
   5.28.2. Specific Exceptions:
       5.28.2.1. Comic and feature supplements will not be inserted into and distributed with a
       CE installation guide or map.
       5.28.2.2. DOD official postage must not be used for bulk mailing of CE publications,
       other than newspapers.
   5.28.3. Specific Additions:
       5.28.3.1. The name of the publication may appear on the front cover, inside the front
       cover, or on the first page. As with CE newspapers, it may include the name and
       emblem of the command or installation.
       5.28.3.2. Telephone directory. The installation commander may elect to include a
       telephone directory section in a CE installation guide in lieu of printing an installation
       telephone book, but a separate CE telephone directory is not authorized. Over-run
       printing of the telephone directory/ yellow pages section of the installation guide is
       authorized. The number of guides with telephone directories and the number of over-run
       copies will be clearly specified in the single guide contract.
           5.28.3.2.1. The installation communications office responsible for producing the
           telephone directory section will provide accurate, camera-ready material to the Public
           Affairs office in a mutually agreed to format on a mutually-agreed-to schedule.
           5.28.3.2.2. The required communications security message is to be placed on the
           front page of the telephone directory section and not on the cover of the installation
 98                                              AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


             guide. However, the cover may carry a statement that the publication does include a
             telephone directory section.
             5.28.3.2.3. Contracts for CE installation guides containing a telephone directory
             section must establish a firm delivery date and procedures for distribution.
      5.28.4. If a CE installation guide does not contain a telephone directory section,
      commanders may authorize the inclusion of emergency and service telephone numbers.
      5.28.5. Installation guides may carry pictures of city or area officials and appropriate
      messages from them to Air Force members.
      5.28.6. Upon publication send two copies to the major command.
 5.29. Required Statements. Each installation guide or map will carry a masthead as
 prescribed in Figure 5.5, Section 1e. The masthead should not be placed on the front cover of
 the publication.

       an automatic e-mail subscription service. People can subscribe to the service by visiting
       Air Force Link at http://www.af.mil and clicking on “Subscribe.”
5.31. Other News Services. There are a number of other news services available to Air Force
editors.
   5.31.1. American Forces Press Service (AFPS). AFPS, an element of American Forces
   Information Service, provides news stories, feature articles, line art and photographs for
   editors of DOD publications, military service Public Affairs offices, and news directors of
   DOD‟s broadcast media.
       5.31.1.1. With the exception of copyrighted material, all AFPS material may be
       produced or adapted for use by Air Force newspaper editors. When AFPS material is
       localized or revised, accuracy and conformance to DOD policy must be maintained.

5.32. Commander’s Call Program. The Air Force considers no leadership function more
important than keeping people informed through direct personal contact. Commander‟s call--a
meeting of unit personnel with their commander--provides this contact in a face-to-face forum.
   5.32.1. Conducting Commander‟s Call Programs. Sound leadership, morale, and retention
   all require consistent communication between leaders and their subordinates. Commanders

       effective during individual or unit award presentations.

assigned to the Secretary of the Air Force under Title 10, United States Code, Section 8013, to
keep military personnel, civilian employees and the public informed about the Air Force and its
leaders. AFNEWS manages the Air Force Biography Program. General officer biographies are
also part of personnel records maintained by the Air Force Senior Leadership Management
Office. Locally produced biographies on the Internet do not meet the requirements of this
instruction. The only official Internet site for biographies on senior Air Force leaders is Air
Force Link (http://www.af.mil). Organizational Web sites will link to the appropriate official
biography on Air Force Link. Public Affairs offices may place a general‟s biography on their Web
site after forwarding it to AFNEWS while waiting for the information to appear on Air Force
Link. Once the biography is posted on Air Force Link, the organization‟s Web site must provide
only a link to the official biography on Air Force Link.
   5.36.1. Individuals required to have a biography are responsible for approving material that
   appears in their biographies and must ensure the data agrees with their official records.
   To verify data, active-duty general officers can request their military history records from
   Air Force Senior Leadership Management Office, 1215 Jefferson Davis Hwy, Suite 1002,
   Arlington VA 22202. Since the information sent to AFNEWS will be released on the Web
   and available to the public, the information must be sensitive to current policies concerning
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                      105

  names of all colonels and brigadier generals nominated for appointment to the grade of
  brigadier general and major general and a copy of the officer‟s military history record for
  reference. In addition, the Air Force Senior Leader Management Office provides AFNEWS
  a copy of announcements and orders for all senior leaders‟ promotions, movements, and
  retirements.
     5.36.2.1. The promotion notification from the Air Force Senior Leader Management
     Office to general officers advises them to submit a draft biography and official
     photograph in the new grade to AFNEWS through their servicing Public Affairs office.
     5.36.2.2. The Air Force Senior Leader Management Office notifies senior executives at
     the time of appointment to submit a biography with photograph to AFNEWS through their
     servicing Public Affairs office.

     version on Air Force Link. E-mail the biography or changes to AFNEWS at
     bios@afnews.af.mil or mail to AFNEWS, 203 Norton Street, San Antonio TX 78226-
     1848.
     5.36.3.2. Once the biography is released on Air Force Link, copies can be printed
     directly from the Web site. This is the final, edited version and the one to use when
     making further changes to the biography.
  5.36.4. Format. The format in Figure 5.7, Biography Format, and the following
  requirements should be used in preparing a biography.

         published on the Internet, and may be released to any requester.
         5.36.4.1.4. Disclosure: Voluntary; however, failure to furnish information would
         result in the person not having a biography available for media release.
      5.36.4.2. Spell out acronyms and abbreviations.
      5.36.4.3. Do not include editorial         comments      (best   squadron,    world-class
      organization, most diverse, etc.)
      5.36.4.4. Ensure the current month and year appears at the end of the biography
      information.
      5.36.4.5. List the individual‟s service decorations, awards and devices according to
      order of precedence (see AFI 36-2803, The Air Force Awards and Decorations Program,
      AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, and DOD
      1348.33-M, Manual of Military Decorations and Awards).
      5.36.4.6. Use the Associated Press Stylebook in preparing all biographies. Exceptions
      to the stylebook include using courtesy titles or conversational ranks, as appropriate, in
      second and later references, and capitalizing select duty titles. Paragraph 5.6 contains

  instead. AFNEWS does not download images from a Web site, and images embedded in a
  document cannot be extracted. Photographs must be high quality and in sharp focus for
  reproduction. Avoid distracting foregrounds or backgrounds. Flags may be included, but
  must not detract from the main subject—the individual. Prior to setting up the official senior
  leader‟s portrait, review technical portrait procedures in AFI 36-2632, Official Photographs
  of Air Force General Officers, and AFI 33-117, Multimedia (MM) Management. When
  mailing, include the individual‟s name on the back of the photo and protect it with cardboard.
      5.36.5.1. Military personnel will wear service dress uniform, without hat, showing
      ribbons and rank. Check decorations against the order of precedence.
      5.36.5.2. Officers will wear the new rank in photographs for biography changes
      resulting from promotions.
      5.36.5.3. Civilian employees will wear appropriate business attire.
   5.36.6. AFNEWS is not a repository for senior leadership photographs. High-resolution
   images are available on Air Force Link on a number of senior officials. For other
   photographs, contact the general officer‟s staff or 11 CS/SCUA, 3 Brookley, Suite 103,
   Bolling AFB, Washington DC 20332-0403.

     individual is promoted or reassigned, if the individual changes duties, or if there is an
     organizational name change. These changes take priority and are accomplished in the order
     in which received.
         5.36.9.1. Other changes. Notify AFNEWS but do not send the entire biography.
         5.36.9.2. General officers, the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief Master Sergeant

     Air Force service will reflect information through their final assignment. Updates or revisions
     are not done after an individual retires or leaves the Air Force

     officially connected with the Air Force at local, state and national levels may be collected,
     kept and used by Public Affairs offices subject to the following conditions:

   5.41.9. Supporting a visit by an Airman writer and photographer. Planning is essential for a
   successful visit. Before the visit, the team leader will discuss story ideas, people to be
   interviewed, photo possibilities, and support requirements with the local Public Affairs
   representative. Normally, the team does not add or change stories after arrival. When
   planning an Airman visit, as a minimum, public affairs representatives should consider the
   following:
         5.41.9.1. Individuals to be interviewed and photographed must meet all requirements
         of AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel. Particular
         attention is given to fitness standards, haircut, mustache and weight compliance. In
         addition, subjects being photographed must comply with current safety, security, and
         technical order requirements.
         5.41.9.2. Airman staff members have no need to be briefed on any classified material
         since articles contain only unclassified information. Those being interviewed should be
         advised not to discuss classified material.
         5.41.9.3. People being interviewed should be informed that interviews may be tape-
         recorded to ensure accuracy of all comments.
         5.41.9.4. When making billeting arrangements, clerks should be advised that Airman
         staff members‟ orders authorize separate, secure, private rooms to protect high-value
         equipment and to meet mission requirements.
         5.41.9.5. Travel costs are a major consideration in story selection and trip scheduling.
         Therefore, on-base billeting and government transportation should be provided when
         possible.
5.42. Air Force Policy Letter Digest. Air Force Policy Letter Digest, is a monthly newsletter
that provides unclassified national, DOD and Air Force policy to Air Force leaders. AFNEWS
edits, formats and distributes the digest.

                                            Chapter 6

                                   MEDIA OPERATIONS

Section 6A—Purpose and Objectives of Media Operations

6.1. Purpose of Media Operations. Media operations is one of the primary means for
achieving the Public Affairs core competencies of Airman morale and readiness, public trust
and support and global influence and deterrence. Media operations programs are used to link
Airmen and their leaders, link the Air Force to the community and inform global audiences
about air and space capabilities. Media operations expertise is critical to an Expeditionary
Public Affairs force as the Public Affairs triad may be called upon to handle media issues
anywhere in the world on a moment‟s notice.
6.2. Objectives of the Media Operations Program.
   6.2.1. Targets audiences with Air Force messages.
   6.2.2. Deploys time-sensitive information.
   6.2.3. Conveys Air Force core competencies to a broader audience.
   6.2.4. Targets media strategies to an international audience.

Section 6B—General Release of Information

6.3. Responsibilities. Senior commanders are responsible for releasing information within their
purview. The SAF/PA director is the coordination authority for all Air Force media activities
and issues that have national or international implications. Even though material is unclassified
or has been cleared through security review channels, do not give it to the public unless the
commander (or the commander‟s authorized Public Affairs representative) approves it for that
purpose. This avoids releases out of context that could mislead the public. It also filters out
inaccurate material or information that must be protected for legal or policy reasons.
   6.3.1. All military and civilian personnel must comply in spirit and letter with the
   Secretary of Defense‟s principles of public information and Air Force “full
   disclosure/minimum delay” standards, thereby assuring commanders and Public Affairs
   staffs of rapid, accurate and continuous flow of information to the public.
       6.3.1.1. Present Air Force information professionally, simply and honestly.
       6.3.1.2. Be accurate, prompt and factual.
       6.3.1.3. Confine the information to field of expertise.
       6.3.1.4. Avoid the hypothetical and speculative.
       6.3.1.5. Reflect Air Force policy.
   6.3.2. Classified Information. Do not release classified information. See 6.22 for
   circumstances when exposure to sensitive or classified information is allowed. Consult DOD
   5200.1-R, Information Security Program; and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
   Management. These publications tell: how to classify, downgrade, and declassify
116                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   information; who may release and receive certain information; what to do before telling the
   public about weapons systems; how to challenge the classification of material; and how open
   publication affects classified material.
       6.3.2.1. Commanders will inform Public Affairs on all important operations and
       operational information affecting the organization, including classified aspects.
       6.3.2.2. Unfavorable information must not be classified or withheld simply to avoid
       criticism of the Air Force.
6.4. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act. Federal statute, DOD and Air
Force policy requires prompt and accurate disclosure of information to the public. The FOIA
(Title 5, United States Code, Section 552), explained in DODD 5400.7, DOD Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) Program, and the Privacy Act of 1974 (Title 5, United States Code,
Section 552a), AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, are important to Public Affairs. The FOIA
directs maximum release of information. According to DOD, the commander, through Public
Affairs and with the advice of the Staff Judge Advocate, should provide media releasable
information without forcing representatives of the news media representatives to go through
FOIA channels. The 1 Sep 05 distributed memorandum regarding “Withholding of Information
that Personally Identifies DoD Personnel” states in general, release of information on DoD
personnel will be limited to the names, official titles, organizations, and telephone numbers
for personnel only at the office director level or above, provided a determination is made that
disclose does not raise security or privacy concerns. This requires the Staff Judge Advocate to
provide advice in a timely manner. Media representatives can request information under FOIA,
completely bypassing Public Affairs. FOIA channels take longer than Public Affairs due to
administrative procedures. The FOIA does not provide explanations or answer questions. In
cases where news media representatives submits FOIA requests and Public Affairs can
provide more information, both the FOIA and Public Affairs offices should coordinate
responses.
   6.4.1. Consider rights of living relatives and associates of deceased Air Force people. The
   Privacy Act, and the privacy exemptions of the FOIA, do not protect the personal privacy of
   deceased persons. Records about the deceased, however, may be withheld under FOIA or the
   Privacy Act to protect the privacy of living relatives and associates if the records contain
   private, personal information about the family or other background of persons still living.
   Use good judgment.
   6.4.2. The Privacy Act was designed to protect individuals. It often prevents the Air Force
   from disclosing information to the news media even though an individual may have already
   chosen to voluntarily discuss Privacy Act matters with reporters. If individuals want the Air
   Force to assist the news media with a particular matter, they can waive their rights under the
   Privacy Act by signing a Privacy Act release. On a case-by-case basis, Public Affairs should
   consider the option of contacting the individual or the news media to offer a Privacy Act
   release.
       6.4.2.1. An example of a Privacy Act release statement is: “I hereby authorize Air Force
       officials to disclose any information about me, whether or not protected by the Privacy
       Act, Freedom of Information Act, or any Air Force directives, to (specific news
       organization or person) in response to (his/her) interest in my case.“ This release
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                            117


       document must be signed and dated by the individual waiving his or her rights. Consult
       and coordinate the release with the Staff Judge Advocate prior to signature.
6.5. Policy Limits. Special policies often govern the release of information. They come from
HQ USAF, MAJCOM, FOA, or local levels within the Air Force. They also come from higher or
lateral levels within the U.S. Government.
6.6. Published, Released or Cleared 1nformation. Do not assume information about the Air
Force has been officially released because it appears in the media. Neither does the appearance
of classified information mean it is now unclassified, nor can it be used or referred to by Air
Force spokespersons. Operational or technical information combined for re-release must
meet the same release standards as the original information.
6.7. Air Force People. Occasions may arise when special directives control releasable
information about individuals under certain conditions. For additional guidance on the release
of casualty information see
6.28. The following guidelines apply to the release of information:

   biographies are not releasable.
   6.7.5. Death of Civilian Employee or Military Personnel. See AFI 36-809, Civilian
   Survivor Assistance. The apparent cause of death (i.e. homicide, suicide) is not releasable
   until the investigation is completed. Any news releases and interviews will not include
   tentative or speculative conclusions, or use terms such as: homicide, suicide, or self inflicted.
   Comments concerning the death should be limited to: “The cause of death is under
   investigation (or undetermined).” Release must not be made until next of kin have been
   notified.
   6.7.6. Discharges. Administrative discharges are not releasable. Don‟t release whether
   honorable, under honorable conditions (general), or under other than honorable conditions,
   unless the affected person gives written consent. Exception: If a case has received
   extensive publicity, this information may be releasable (ask your Staff Judge Advocate or
   SAF/PAM). If the discharge results from a court-martial, the record of trial is a public
   document. The sentence and subsequent clemency action, if any, are releasable.
   6.7.7. Duty Location. Current, past, and future assignments are releasable, except sensitive
   and overseas assignments masked in unit records. Present or future assignments, office and
118                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009

  (BAH). In addition, duty telephone number; date of rank (DOR); entered active duty date
  (EAD); pay date; source of commission; and promotion sequence number, Air Force
  specialty code (unless operational security considerations warrant withholding a specific
  duty descriptions), position title, office, unit address, and duty phone number, and
  professional military education are releasable. See AFI 33-332, for other items releasable
  under the Privacy Act Program not requiring consent.
   6.7.9. Education. Information concerning civilian educational degrees and major areas
   of study, school and year of graduation is not releasable without written consent of the
   member.
   6.7.10. Employers of Reserve or National Guard Members. Not releasable without the

   6.7.18. Names of Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard Aircrew members. Do not
   release names of AFRC or ANG aircrew members involved in incidents under investigation
   by the FAA. Air Force policy is for crewmembers to assist FAA by using their
   assigned radio call signs. Coordinate responses to such queries with the flying safety
   officer or director of operations.
   6.7.19. Prisoners. Base releases about stockade or guardhouse prisoner escapes, unusual
   incidents, or disturbances in local confinement facilities lead to satisfactory relations with
   the general public and the news media. Limit release to information on DD Form 553,
   Deserter/Absentee Wanted by the Armed Forces.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           119


   6.7.20. Prisoners of War and Missing in Action (POW/MIA). OASD/PA regulates
   information release. Since hostilities and conditions of peace vary, information policy
   changes periodically. SAF/ PA distributes current policy.
   6.7.21. Race or National Origin. Generally not releasable unless it is germane to an issue
   that may impact the public‟s perception of Air Force equal opportunity programs or
   accusations of racism.
6.8. Accidents and Safety. See Chapter 7, Crisis Communications, and AFI 91-204, Safety
Investigations and Reports.
6.9. Courts. Legal directives provide detailed guidance concerning the types of releasable
information before a trial. In all cases, closely coordinate with your Staff Judge Advocate (SJA)
before releasing information. Serious charges are newsworthy, especially those that directly or
indirectly concern the public. These may include cases for flying violations, aircraft accidents,
and nonmilitary offenses such as larcenies and assaults allegedly committed by Air Force people
in the community. Air Force policy for releasing information on criminal proceedings is that:
   6.9.1. Media representatives, as members of the public, may attend open sessions of Air
   Force courts.
   6.9.2. Cameras, video equipment and audio equipment are not permitted in Air Force
   courtrooms during court sessions (see Manual for Courts Martial).
   6.9.3. News releases should convey that military and civilian courts are similar, based on the
   principle that the accused is considered innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable
   doubt.
   6.9.4. Releasable material may include:
       6.9.4.1. Names of persons charged with crimes unless the person is a minor.
       6.9.4.2. Date and nature of the alleged offense, as shown in the court-martial order.
       6.9.4.3. Sentence, if approved.
       6.9.4.4. Type of discharge (if any) from the Air Force, and whether it was executed,
       suspended, or remitted.
       6.9.4.5. Confinement circumstances or date of release from confinement.
       6.9.4.6. Previous convictions or absence of them, provided the court finds the accused
       guilty in the present case.
       6.9.4.7. Acquittal, emphasizing it is commensurate with previously published
       accusations.
   6.9.5. Avoid sensationalism, exaggeration and use of the term “criminal.” Do not use
   editorial words prejudicial to the accused before trial, such as hit-and-run driver, deserter or
   murderer. Before conviction, releases may say the accused is charged with the crime, or
   alleged to have committed it. Avoid military terms, jargon, clichés or slang, unless in a direct
   quote.
   6.9.6. Media interviews and telephonic communication between media and people in
   confinement are prohibited by DODD 1325.4, Confinement of Military Prisoners and
120                                              AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   Administration of Military Correctional Programs and Facilities, and AFI 31-205, The Air
   Force Corrections System.
   6.9.7. Do not release the names of minor children or other victims.
   6.9.8. Coordinate requests for release of information about courts martial with the servicing
   SJA.
6.10. Dissent. Dissident and protest activities are rare in the Air Force. They might
concern human rights, political activism, or other causes. As a rule, protests arise from local
grievances. Problem resolution must stay at that level to be effective. Local commanders are
responsible for solving the problem. Consult with installation experts, such as equal opportunity
officer, SJA, chaplain. See Chapter 7, Crisis Communication.
6.11. Gifts to the Air Force. Gifts are a contribution, donation, bequest, or device offered
to the Air Force. This does not address gifts to individuals. Guidance on gifts to individuals
can be found in DOD5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation, and AFI 51-901, Gifts from Foreign
Governments. Gifts to the Air Force must be desirable and useful, and contribute to the health,
comfort, and morale of Air Force people. Acceptance is based on the best interests of the Air
Force, subject to the rules established in AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force,
and the following guidelines:
   6.11.1. The Air Force, and the command accepting the gift, must not publicly acknowledge
   it, such as in a news release, except when the mention of the gift is incidental to the story.
   For example, a gift given to commemorate the Air Force anniversary may be mentioned in a
   story about the anniversary or celebration.
   6.11.2. The donor may announce the gift through a news release, publicity, advertising or
   any other means. Such announcements should not imply that the Air Force, or Air Force
   people, endorse the product.
   6.11.3. The U.S. Government cannot furnish free transportation for gifts. Donors must
   consider the time and expense of commercial transportation, especially to overseas areas,
   before offering gifts. Gifts may be mailed to the commander of the particular unit that
   receives the gift, or to another specific individual.
      6.11.4. The Air Force must not give the donor any special concessions or privileges.
6.12. Investigations or Reports by Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI). S ee
A FP D 71-1, Criminal Investigations and Counterintelligence; and AFI 71-101, Criminal
Investigations, Protective Service Matters, and Counterintelligence.
6.13. Legal Procedures and Litigation. See AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation.
6.14. DOD Homosexual Conduct Policy. Refer to the most current Public Affairs guidance
and contact the local staff judge advocate and higher headquarters Public Affairs for specifics.
6.15. Force Structure Announcements. As a matter of policy Force Structure or Base
Realignment and Closure announcements are made at Headquarters Air Force level. No public
comments should be made until official announcements are made at the headquarters level and
congressional notification has been completed. PAs must work closely with the SJA,
manpower and organization experts as well as higher headquarters PA to prepare and coordinate
questions and answers and news releases before commenting.

6.16. Reduction in Force (RIF). Consult higher headquarters Public Affairs before releasing
any reduction in force information.
6.17. Scientists and Engineers. Significant work by Air Force scientists and engineers can
be releasable, see AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program.
6.18. Technical Documents. See AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific and Technical
Information.
6.19. Contracts and Contractors’ Releases.
   6.19.1. Unclassified Contracts. Companies or institutions with unclassified Air Force
   contracts may release information about them unless the contract states otherwise. DOD
   5220.22-R, Industrial Security Regulation, governs release of information by colleges and
   universities holding unclassified research and development contracts or letters of intent. The
   following may be released without further DOD approval:
       6.19.1.1. A statement that the contract, letter of intent, or supplement agreement
       has been received. Certain types of contracts (such as proposals for a new electronic
       system, a high-altitude research study, etc.) if this information is not limited by the
       contract.
       6.19.1.2. Information of public or professional interest about the work being done, if this
       information is not limited by terms of the contract.
       6.19.1.3. Information previously approved for release.
   6.19.2. Classified Contracts. Companies or institutions with classified Air Force contracts
   prepare initial information announcements relating to new Air Force programs. DOD
   5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, regulates these
   announcements. The manual is an attachment to DD Form 441, Department of Defense
   Security Agreement. The agreement enables a company to receive classified contracts and
   the classified information to meet them. This agreement prohibits the contractor from
   releasing information that pertains to classified contracts or projects until it is approved
   for this purpose. The contractor usually sends it directly to the Directorate for Security
   Review, Office of the Secretary of Defense, for approval.
       6.19.2.1. The contract may specifically require the contractor to route the proposed
       release through an Air Force activity. In this case, Public Affairs reviews and clears the
       information for open publication. Public Affairs must coordinate the proposed release
       with the appropriate system program office, security office, and other interested
       agencies. If a non-DOD agency awards the classified contract or project to the
       contractor, requests for information release are sent to that agency.

Section 6C——Release of Information on Operational Subjects.

6.20. Alert Status. Information concerning changes of alert status or defense readiness
condition (DEFCON) may be released only by SAF/PA after coordination with OASD/PA. In
addition, Public Affairs offices at all levels must be notified at once by their local command
post when there are changes in alert status. The local force protection condition (FPCON) may
be released to the general public if conditions affect the local community. For example, if the
base will be closed or an ID check at the gate will be instituted causing disruption to local traffic
122                                              AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


patterns, release the information. However, do not release the steps taken during a FPCON
except to say that the unit is increasing its vigilance. Consult major command Public Affairs
offices for additional guidance.
6.21. Deployments.
   6.21.1. Releasable information. Release guidance from higher headquarters usually precedes
   deployment. However, if it‟s obvious the unit has departed, confirm the obvious but notify
   your higher headquarters. Unless directed otherwise, the following items of information are
   releasable:
         6.21.1.1. Arrival of U.S. units in the commander‟s area of responsibility once announced
         by DOD or the combatant command.
         6.21.1.2. Date of the unit‟s departure from home station after the unit has reached its
         deployed location.
         6.21.1.3. Home station.
         6.21.1.4. Approximate friendly force strength (multi-squadron, group, wing--not how

         6.21.1.19. Battle damage may be described as “light,” “moderate,” or “heavy.”
      6.21.2. Not releasable. The following items of deployment information are not releasable:
         6.21.2.1. Classified aspects of equipment, procedures, and operations.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                             123

       6.21.2.20. Special operations‟ unique methods, equipment, tactics that, if disclosed,
       could harm mission accomplishment.
       6.21.2.21. Information on operational or support vulnerabilities.
       6.21.2.22. Specific methods and tactics, speeds, and formations.
6.22. Access to Sensitive Information. Unit commanders may determine that coverage of a
story will involve exposure to sensitive or classified information, but coverage of which is in the
best interests of the Air Force. The primary safeguard will be to brief the reporter in advance
about what information is sensitive and what the parameters are for covering this type of
information. The commander may offer access if the reporter agrees to a security review of
the product. Agreement to a security review in exchange for this type of access is strictly
voluntary; however, if a reporter does not agree then access may be denied. If a reporter agrees
124                                               AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


to a security review, it will be conducted solely to ensure that sensitive or classified information is
not included in the product.
6.23. Intelligence or Reconnaissance Activities. News releases may not be made regarding
intelligence activities, except as authorized by SAF/PA.
6.24. Chemical, Biological and Radiological Warfare. Air Force Public Affairs material
that deals with chemical, biological, or radiological warfare must be cleared by OASD/PA,
through SAF/PA.
6.25. Simulated Employment of Nuclear Weapons on Maneuvers and Training
Exercises. The fact that a particular maneuver or exercise will involve the simulated
employment of nuclear weapons may be released to news media, as the maneuver commander
deems necessary. However, the technique required in the use of any nuclear weapon must not be
released.
6.26. Movement of Units. See paragraph 6.21 for general information on movement of Air
Force units.
   6.26.1. CONUS to Overseas. Information on the movement of Air Force units to overseas
   areas must be released initially by OASD/PA, unless delegation is authorized. SAF/PA must
   immediately notify all command Public Affairs offices directly or indirectly concerned, that
   such a release is being made. The time and content of the release must be included in this
   notification. In addition, policy guidance on releasing any information subsequent to the
   initial release must be incorporated. This policy applies to all commands affected by the
   move, even if the unit is only passing through. MAJCOM Public Affairs offices will
   disseminate the guidance immediately to their affected units. Unit Public Affairs officers
   and commanders must comply strictly with the policy outlined in the notification,
   deviating from it only when specifically authorized by SAF/PA.
   6.26.2. Within Overseas Areas. Within overseas areas, movement releases are governed by
   instructions issued by the theater commander.
   6.26.3. Within CONUS. For unit movements within the CONUS, the following information
   is releasable:
       6.26.3.1. Designation of Unit.
       6.26.3.2. Name and location of new station, assembly point, training area, etc., within
       the U.S., unless the movement itself or new station is classified.
       6.26.3.3. Departure date, if routing for training and details of movement are not
       classified.
       6.26.3.4. General information necessary for local civic relations, such as housing,
       recreation, etc.
       6.26.3.5. On arrival at new station within the United States, resume normal Public
       Affairs activities.
6.27. Personnel Wounded in Combat. Public Affairs must exercise care in releasing
information and photographs of personnel wounded in action or hospitalized for other reasons.
The governing concerns are patient welfare, patient privacy and next of kin/family
considerations. OASD/PA, unless it delegates authority to the combatant command PA, will
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           125


issue an initial news release acknowledging that combat fatalities have occurred. After the
initial release, the services may release additional information on casualties, consistent with the
Privacy Act.
6.28. Casualties. IAW with DODI 1300.18, Military Personnel Casualty Matters, Policies,
and Procedures, no casualty information on deceased military personnel may be released to the
media or the general public until 24 hours after notifying the next-of-kin regarding the casualty
status of the member. Casualty information on ill or injured Airmen may not be released without
the consent of the individual, unless the release is otherwise authorized by the Privacy Act of
1974. In the cases of servicemembers who have been unaccounted for from past conflicts,
public release cannot occur until 24 hours after the family accepts the member‟s
identification, or 24 hours after the family has been notified that the Armed Forces Identification
Review Board has upheld the identification. The purpose of this policy is to respect and
provide for the privacy of the families in the immediate aftermath of notification of the loss or
injury of a service member or of notification of the recovery and identification of a service
member who has been unaccounted for or missing. For more guidance on releasable
information see 6.7
   6.28.1. Medical Care Facilities. Media visits are authorized to medical care facilities, but
   must be approved by the medical facility commander and attending physician and must
   not interfere with medical treatment. A Public Affairs escort is required for all media visits
   to medical facilities.
   6.28.2. Aeromedical Evacuation Flights. Media requests to travel aboard medical flights will
   be considered on a case-by-case basis and will require approval of the supported combatant
   command PA, OASD/PA, the supported combatant command SG and Air Mobility
   Command.
   6.28.3. Unit casualties and losses. Information on unit casualties and losses should be
   described in general terms only, e.g., light, moderate, heavy. The use of percentages,
   numbers of aircraft damaged or destroyed, buildings, facilities, vehicles, etc., will not be
   released without approval of the combatant commander, a designated representative, or
   DOD.
6.29. Casualty Notification to Next of Kin (NOK). Although not an official part of a casualty
notification team, in cases with high potential for media interest, Public Affairs has a valuable
role in assisting with Air Force casualty next-of-kin notification.
   6.29.1. Responsibilities.
       6.29.1.1. Public Affairs should assess the media climate and, in potentially high
       visibility cases (combat related, mass casualties, homicides, etc.) or duty status-
       whereabouts unknown (DUSTWUN), missing or captured, advise the local commander
       of the likelihood of news media contacting the family members of the deceased Airman
       and offer Public Affairs support to the family.
       6.29.1.2. The local commander or notification officer may request that Public Affairs
       accompany the NOK notification team when there are indications of high media interest
       and the possibility of news media contacting the deceased‟s family members directly.
126                                            AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


       6.29.1.3. When accompanying the NOK notification team, the Public Affairs Officer
       should travel with the notification team, but wait in the vehicle while notification is
       made to the family and remain there until requested.
       6.29.1.4. After the NOK notification is completed, the notification officer will provide
       the family the appropriate Public Affairs Media Information Paper and contact
       information for the local Public Affairs Office. If requested, by the family, Public
       Affairs officers will advise the family on interaction with the news media, offer
       assistance with any public statements and define the family‟s preferences on news media
       requests for information.
       6.29.1.5. If the news media is already at the family‟s residence or calling during the
       notification, Public Affairs should offer to act as the liaison between the news media and
       the family, in keeping with the family‟s preferences.
       6.29.1.6. Casualty notification officers in remote areas who do not have Public Affairs
       support will provide the family contact information for the Air Force Personnel
       Casualty Center Public Affairs on-call representative at 1-800-433-0048.
6.30. Unit Activations, 1nactivations, Phasedowns, or Movements. A significant change in
unit level of operations is extremely important news for local communities. This change takes
place after deliberation at appropriate levels of government. Public Affairs personnel should not
discuss these subjects without guidance from higher headquarters.
6.31. Weapon Systems. This category includes aircraft, missiles, munitions, support
systems, subsystems, and space vehicles. Information about the existence, characteristics,
potential, or capabilities of new systems, or improvements or modifications of existing ones,
must be reviewed by SAF/PA before it is released. The same is true for military applications of
nuclear energy, and the following types of warfare subjects: biological, radiological, chemical,
electronic, and psychological.

Section 6D—Working With the Media.

6.32. General Guidelines. The media‟s need for rapid, accurate information requires
immediate response by Air Force officials. It is important to understand media capabilities,
organization, technology and deadlines. It is important to know individual capabilities for each
medium to allow tailoring the Air Force message for maximum effectiveness. This bridge of
mutual respect and understanding is critical to credibility and essential to Air Force interests.
Maintain open, honest dialogue with the news media. Be impartial: Don‟t favor any medium or
media representative. All are entitled to the same consideration. Establish personal contact with
media representatives throughout the area. Media should know Air Force Public Affairs people
and the type of material and support available to them.
   6.32.1. Access to Installations. Bona fide media representatives, freelance writers, and
   photographers may visit Air Force installations. Public Affairs must notify the security forces
   at the main gate or visitor center, and escort media at all times when they are on a military
   installation.
   6.32.2. Market Material. Determine which media want Air Force materials and the type of
   information they need. Include the small weekly newspapers, radio stations, and public
   television in your thinking. The smaller media often serve special interest publics. Do not,
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                            127


   however, send material to media that do not express an interest, as this is a waste of time
   and money unless the newsworthiness of the story is high.
   6.32.3. Bad News. When bad news occurs, release it quickly and candidly. Experience
   proves candor is best. It may be big news for a day or two, but concealing bad news will
   keep it in the headlines longer. Public suspicion will linger indefinitely and future
   communication will be strained. The Air Force recognizes occasional bad news is
   inevitable and it cannot afford any attempt to conceal bad news.
   6.32.4. Story Balance. Make sure the reporter gets all the facts before printing the story.
   Ensure the information presented is non-technical and straightforward. Often, the biggest
   problem is getting the right information in time for the reporter‟s deadline.
   6.32.5. Clippings and Tear Sheets. Limit requests of these items from the media. If multiple
   original clippings are needed regularly, arrange with the publication‟s administrative offices
   to buy the necessary copies. The same principle applies for video, photography and film.
   6.32.6. Technical Jargon and Acronyms. Speak the public‟s language.
6.33. Exclusive Request. An exclusive is a reporter‟s request for information that no other
reporter has asked for. It can involve a minor or major story. The Air Force allows reporters to
work on exclusives, but is obligated to provide the same information to other reporters.
Reporters should be made aware of this policy, to avoid misunderstandings. Interviews, by their
nature, are exclusive in terminology, i.e., quotes and statements, but not in content if another
reporter requests it.
   6.33.1. Minor Story. This news is not particularly significant. Protect the reporter‟s story
   until a similar request comes from another reporter. If this happens, tell the second reporter
   that another media representative is already working on it. The second reporter probably
   won‟t press the issue. If it is pressed, provide the same material to the second reporter,
   and inform the first reporter that another individual is also working the story.
   6.33.2. Major Story. Do not honor any request for exclusive information on a truly major
   story. The Air Force must release information on major stories to all media equally. The
   public‟s right to significant news transcends the right of a single reporter who first asked for
   the information. In-depth feature stories on major issues may be treated exclusively until
   similar queries come from other reporters, or major developments require a general release.
6.34. Air Force Reports on News Programs. Air Force members may do regular reports of
installation news on radio or television stations, if the subject matter pertains exclusively to Air
Force life and activities. All material must be read from written scripts approved by the proper
authority.
6.35. Review of Material. Do not ask a reporter to send material for review unless security
considerations are involved. The primary responsibility for protecting classified information
lies with the Air Force, not the reporter, and the reporter can justifiably refuse any requests for
prior review. The primary safeguard should be to brief the reporter in advance about what
information is sensitive and what the parameters are for covering this type of information.
6.36. Duty Officer. Public Affairs, or a designated representative, must be available 24 hours
a day for significant breaking news stories, accidents and other events that require immediate
action. Arrange to have someone on call during off-duty hours. Brief security forces,
 128                                             AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


 operations center, and telephone personnel on the procedures for contacting the duty
 representative. An instruction book should be prepared for the duty representative‟s use. As a
 minimum, it should contain emergency checklists and off-duty telephone numbers of Public
 Affairs staff members, and key unit installation officials. Instruction books must be checked
 frequently to ensure instructions and officials‟ names and telephone numbers are current.
 6.37. News Release. The news release is the most common way to deliver information to the
 media. It may announce news or answer anticipated queries. The news release varies in length,
 but most often is a page of newsworthy information. Prepare news releases according to the
 guidelines in Figure 6.1 For sample news releases dealing with crises, see Chapter 7, Crisis
 Communication.
     6.37.1. Follow-up of story. If the news is interesting invite media to cover the event. Media
     are more apt to use the story if they invest time in its development.
     6.37.2. Photographs, video and graphics. Provide available photographs, video and graphics
     with the story. Products should meet requirements of the intended media. This often
     makes the difference between use and rejection. Know the local media‟s preferences for
     imagery--do they want photos, graphics, color slides or digital imagery? What type of video
     format--Beta or VHS?
         6.37.2.1. Identify the action and people in photos. Don‟t write on the back of the
         photograph--the pen may bleed through the photo. Some PAs attach a photo page with
         the release. Others use a label with a caption. Identify the photographer and annotate
         “U.S. Air Force Photograph.”
         6.37.2.2. Prepackaged broadcast news stories, also known as video news releases
         (VNRs) must include clear notification within the text or audio that the Air Force
         funded the VNR. Public Affairs officers are responsible for ensuring VNRs do not
         cross the line between legitimate governmental information and improper government-
         funded advocacy.

Release No. 03-06-04
June 23, 2004


RANDOLPH AIR FORCE BASE, Texas --Type your release using this format and if extra pages
are needed use plain paper and number the pages. Start typing the story about one-fourth of the
way down from the top of the first page. Double space, using one side of each page, and give the
release a brief title so an editor can understand it at a glance.

    Summarize the story‟s outstanding facts in the lead, or first paragraph and make it concise.
 AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                               129


Answer these questions: who, what, when, where, why and how. Use simple, clear sentence
structure with active verbs. Avoid disconnected or complicated sentences, long paragraphs, and
paragraphs beginning with the same word or phrase.


-- MORE --


NEWS RELEASE/2-2-2
Type slug line and page number at the top left-hand corner of the second and subsequent pages.
Don‟t make the lead a direct quote or question. Also, don‟t put names, including your
commander‟s, in the lead unless it‟s part of the story. Make the time element clear. Is the story
today‟s or
yesterday‟s news? A good way to freshen the time element is to lead with a fact that updates
slightly stale news. This often can save a story you could not release earlier.

     After summarizing the pertinent facts, amplify remaining details in subsequent paragraphs.
Present them in descending order of importance using the inverted pyramid style. Tell the story
once. Do not repeat facts. Simple and logical presentation gives a release its punch. Present
information honestly. Avoid statements taken out of the original context.

Include a point of contact with phone numbers and e-mail address for more information.

 6.38. Response to Query. When working on an Air Force story, media usually call the nearest
 Air Force installation for facts or comments. Public Affairs must be ready to answer these
 queries. Answer queries about your unit‟s activities. Don‟t respond to Air Force policy
 questions unless higher headquarters has provided Public Affairs guidance. For example, if
 the Pentagon were reviewing policy on integrated training--even if you are at a training base,
 you would refer questions beyond your unit‟s scope to SAF! PA.
       6.38.1. PA Availability. The media may not know there is an installation Public Affairs
       Office. They may ask for operator assistance or some agency appropriate to the query, such
       as the personnel office. For this reason, media sometimes are referred to an inappropriate
       office. Keep this to a minimum by periodically reminding telephone operators and
       functional staff to refer media callers to the Public Affairs office.
       6.38.2. Deadlines. Find out the deadline to provide the best, timely response. Functional
       staffs may not realize the consequences of a missed deadline. If a query cannot be answered
       by the deadline, the story probably will appear without an Air Force comment, and the Air
       Force has missed an opportunity. If something delays response, call the reporter as soon as
       possible and before the deadline. If possible, offer partial information or an interim reply.
       If the information is not available locally, tell the media. Identify the source and offer the
       media the option to work it themselves, or have you continue working it.
130                                             AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   6.38.3. Write Down Media Queries. Repeat the reporter‟s questions to make sure you
   understand the request. Use AF Form 39, Response to Query. It has fill-in blocks for all
   the essentials, including space to coordinate the proposed answer with all necessary
   functional agencies. This provides an accurate answer and shows the leadership the answer
   was staffed.
   6.38.4. Gather Information. Public Affairs must often coordinate with other staff agencies
   to get the information reporters are requesting. Other staff agencies usually realize media
   queries require rapid response, but they also have other work to do. Success depends on
   staff cooperation, so be sensitive and diplomatic when requesting help.
6.39. Classified Answers. If an answer is classified, tell the reporter you cannot provide the
information because it is classified. If possible, explain why it‟s classified.
6.40. Coordination. Establish media query coordination procedures for your
organization. I f t h e query involves sensitive information, or comes from national-level
media, consult with the next higher headquarters Public Affairs office before responding. If the
query involves a subject of local significance, coordinate the response with the host commander.
If the query involves a controversial or sensitive subject directly related to a tenant unit without
a local PA, coordinate the reply with the tenant‟s command Public Affairs office.

Section 6E—Interviews

6.41. 1nterviews. The Air Force cannot accomplish its mission without the support of an
informed American public. As a steward of the nation‟s defense, you should view each interview
as an opportunity to carry Air Force messages clearly, concisely, and positively to the American
people. With proper preparation, knowledge of your messages and use of a few tools to control
an interview, you can have a positive influence on the outcome of stories about the Air Force.
The bottom line is without your support, the Air Force will miss important opportunities to
present its side of the issues.
   6.41.1. Purpose of Interviews. Interviews give reporters the chance to get in-depth
   information on the Air Force directly from primary sources. This also permits rapid
   correction of misconceptions. Reporters like individual interviews to protect exclusive
   stories from competitors. Usually, interviews are one-on-one between a reporter and the
   official, with PA monitoring.
6.42. Attribution. Public Affairs communicates Air Force policy. Ask media to attribute
statements to the Air Force, an Air Force spokesperson, or something similar. If this does not
suit the event or media needs, they may quote you by name. Always consider interviews “on-
the-record” and do not say anything you don‟t want to see in print or broadcast. However, should
you decide to say something “on-background” or “off-the-record,” clearly state in advance
that the following portion of the interview is “off-the-record,” to ensure there is no
confusion. The interviewer must agree you are on-background or off-the-record. Otherwise,
you‟re on-the-record.
   6.42.1. On-the-Record. Provides only information releasable and attributable.
   6.42.2. Background. The reporter may use material verbatim, but may not identify the
   interviewee by name or title. The reporter and the interviewee come to an agreement
   regarding attribution. An example is: “A senior Air Force official said.”
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                          131


   6.42.3. Deep Background. The reporter may use material verbatim, but may not identify the
   individual, his or her title or place of duty. There is only general attribution, such as: “Air
   Force (or Defense) sources said.”
   6.42.4. Not for Attribution. Not attributed to anyone or any establishment. An example is:
   “It was learned today that. ...”
   6.42.5. Off-the-Record. Provides information that may not be used unless confirmed by
   another source. It is provided for a reporter‟s understanding of an issue. Off-the-record
   should be used rarely, if at all, and only when there are compelling reasons.
6.43. Interview Preparation. Success in an interview is directly tied to the quality of
preparation, ability to articulate messages, and manage the emotional climate of the interview.
Prior to any interview, find out as much as possible about the interviewer and audience. Don‟t
think an interview is a conversation and “wing it.“ Instead, view it as a chance to make a well-
developed presentation reflecting research, preparation, and enthusiasm.
   6.43.1. Dealing with Reporters. Make sure the news organization and the reporter are
   reputable. If in doubt, ask higher headquarters for advice. Determine what the reporter
   wants to know and the intended use of the information. What kind of stories does the
   reporter usually work on? Are other interviews being done on the subject (if so, with
   whom)? Could the Air Force be placed in an adversarial relationship to a community
   interest? Answers to these questions will help you determine whether, and to what extent,
   you should support an interview.
   6.43.2. Identify a Spokesperson. After receiving an interview request, determine the right
   spokesperson. The spokesperson must present a positive Air Force image and be able to
   speak on the subject without further clearance.
   6.43.3. Interview Set Up. Determine the time, place, and uniform for the particular
   interview. It should be appropriate to the subject matter. For example, for a TV interview
   about an aircraft, consider conducting the interview on the flight line with the spokesperson
   in either a flight suit or BDUs.
6.44. Messages. Interviews are a time to respond to questions and assert messages. Anticipate
issues and questions a given interview will present and be ready with short, memorable, positive
and relevant messages. Identify three to five points the public needs to understand about the
subject. These are the key messages. Messages should be:
   6.44.1. Short. Think in terms of sound bites and one to two dozen quotable words.
   6.44.2. Memorable. Use crisp, high-impact words that will stick with your audience.
   6.44.3. Positive. Write messages to emphasize the affirmative.
   6.44.4. Relevant. For impact, a message must be meaningful to the audience.
6.45. Interview Techniques.
   6.45.1. Honesty. Always answer honestly, but without saying “no comment.” If you don‟t
   know the answer to a question, or if the answer is classified, or would invade someone‟s
   privacy--say so. Then bridge to a message.
132                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   6.45.2. Protect the Record. Unless challenged, bad information has a way of propagating
   and taking on a life of its own. If an interviewer asks a question based upon false data, be
   sure to protect and, if necessary, correct the record. However, don‟t repeat the negative
   assertion or misconception. Respond with the corrected, positive message.
   6.45.3. Inverted Pyramid. Put significant information at the beginning of the interview.
   6.45.4. Bridging. Bridging is a smooth transition from the question to a message. A direct
   question deserves a direct answer. After briefly touching on the answer, bridge to a message.
   6.45.5. Hooking. Hooking is taking advantage of opportunities before and during the
   interview to help focus on what you want to talk about. Tell the reporter what‟s on your
   mind--you‟ll be amazed at how receptive a reporter can be to what you want to talk about.
   6.45.6. Flagging. Flagging is a way to underscore, verbally and nonverbally, what‟s
   important. Use voice inflection, a hand gesture, eye contact, body language or a phrase like,
   “What is really critical to know about this issue...“ to ensure the reporter and the audience
   have a clear understanding of what is important.
   6.45.7. Personal Credibility. Use personal knowledge and experience to avoid speaking
   about the Air Force in the abstract. If you can say, “I‟ve flown the plane“ or “I‟ve talked
   to the men and women using the technology,“ do it. Critics use their credentials and so
   should you.
   6.45.8. Repeat Your Message. Repetition is important to ensure messages are remembered
   so clearly that to leave them out of the final story would constitute negligence by the
   reporter.
   6.45.9. Non-verbals. Make sure facial expressions and hand gestures are appropriate to the
   words and seriousness of the issue. Concentrate on the interviewer, maintain eye contact, and
   convey conviction and enthusiasm. Don‟t slouch, rock back and forth, swivel, twitch, or
   twiddle.
   6.45.10. Enthusiasm. Research shows the average viewer remembers only seven percent of
   the words spoken. The balance of the audience impression depends on voice, face,
   uniform, and the personal charm and credibility you bring to the interview.
   6.45.11. Language. Remember to speak the public‟s language. Avoid acronyms, jargon, or
   technical terms. Messages must be easily understood by every audience member.
   6.45.12. Stay Current. Know what‟s been on the evening news and in the papers prior to an
   interview. Interviewers will know what‟s in the news. So should you.
   6.45.13. Arguments. Don‟t argue. Be responsive but maintain control. Use conflict
   creatively to reemphasize key messages. However, by the same token, there may be times
   when an interviewer is being confrontational, and you must “step up” to the situation to
   maintain control of the interview. Never become a passive interview participant.

Section 6F—Media Support

6.46. News Briefings. News briefings are the best way to release news to all media at one
time. Be sure the information and media interest (e.g., number of queries received) warrant a
news briefing. A news briefing is reserved for immediate, important and useful news. If in
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                              133


doubt as to whether a topic should be considered for a news briefing, talk to higher
headquarters Public Affairs. Because a news briefing is a major event, it often involves key
installation people. Be sure the commander and staff understand the purpose of a news briefing
and have been thoroughly prepared before interacting with the media.
   6.46.1. Consider a news briefing when: A story or announcement is so important, sensitive
   or complex both the Air Force and media benefit from face-to-face presentation.
       6.46.1.1. A high level person visits or is assigned.
       6.46.1.2. Other types of releases can‟t adequately convey the information.
   6.46.2. Invitations to media should:
       6.46.2.1. Be made by telephone as far in advance as possible. If time allows, follow up in
       writing. The day before the event, call again with a very brief reminder.
       6.46.2.2. Briefly cover the subject and material the news briefing will address. Do not
       disclose details, but tell editors enough so they can judge whether or not to send a
       reporter.
       6.46.2.3. Don‟t promise anything that cannot be delivered.
       6.46.2.4. Consider Deadlines. Plan the news briefing for a day and time that‟s meets the
       publishing and broadcast deadlines of the media outlets. This will ensure maximum
       coverage of your event For example, an early afternoon news briefing will satisfy a
       newspaper with a morning distribution, but not a newspaper with an afternoon
       circulation.
       6.46.2.5. Go to all local media, even those that do not usually cover your activities.
   6.46.3. Set-up Requirements.
       6.46.3.1. A suitable room or location that is easy to find. It needs enough electric power
       for broadcast equipment and lights. The power requirements for television lighting are
       substantial; make sure power lines have sufficient amperage. Network crews use more
       lighting than local crews. Generally, the first crew on the scene will provide light for
       everyone. If it is a large room, install public address equipment and a multiple outlet
       box, if available, for audio pickup.
       6.46.3.2. Telephones nearby for news filing.
       6.46.3.3. An appropriate background. Avoid reflective surfaces or highly patterned or
       distracting backgrounds. Use background colors that contrast favorably with the Air
       Force blue uniform and any equipment models that will be displayed.
       6.46.3.4. Coordinate with security forces so reporters‟ entrance to the installation is
       smooth. Meet reporters at the visitor center or gate and escort or convoy to the news
       briefing site.
       6.46.3.5. Press kits may include background information, biographies, manufacturer
       literature, statistics, photographs, artists‟ drawings, television film clips, or anything else
       appropriate to the subject. Do not overload the kits with irrelevant material.
134                                               AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


         6.46.3.6. Refreshments are optional. If light refreshments such as soft drinks, coffee, and
         doughnuts are necessary, keep them on an out-of-the-way table that will allow for self-
         service. The commander‟s contingency fund may be used to pay for refreshments.
         (See AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds—Guidance and Procedures).
      6.46.4. Conduct the News Briefing.
         6.46.4.1. Have reporters sign in and distribute press kits as the reporters arrive.
         6.46.4.2. Begin on Time. Media have deadlines and other obligations.
         6.46.4.3. Public Affairs opens the news briefing by establishing the ground rules.
         Ground rules consist of a short statement outlining the purpose of the news briefing;
         sequence of events, including length of time and opportunity for questions; any
         limitations on subject matter; and state the news briefing is on the record and is being
         recorded. Public Affairs also introduces the spokesperson.
         6.46.4.4. The question period follows the spokesperson‟s statement. Have subject matter
         experts present to assist with in-depth, technical questions. Limit subject matter
         experts to only those needed.            Public Affairs briefs all news briefing
         participants/experts on message development and interview techniques.
         6.46.4.5. Quickly summarize and close the news briefing.
         6.46.4.6. The news briefing should be either videotaped or recorded. This helps Public
         Affairs answer any subsequent requests for clarification, provides a complete record for
         reporters unable to be present, and helps meet any other requests for the information.
   6.46.5. Follow-up.
         6.46.5.1. If appropriate, prepare and distribute a news release to media not present.
         Provide a copy of the transcript to the media if they request it.
         6.46.5.2. Prepare an interim report for principals and higher headquarters Public Affairs
         offices, so they will know who attended, questions asked, and what coverage to expect.
         6.46.5.3. Send a final report when newspaper clippings and broadcast summaries are
         available. Assess impact of this coverage for the official who conducted the news
         briefing.
6.47. Informal Communication. Informal communication is a fine way to establish rapport
and build sound professional relationships with media and key staff people. Visit all
significant local area media and officials on the installation and determine expectations and
needs. Although official contact probably will be the primary form of communication with most
people from that point, it is equally important to see media and installation officials in other
contexts. Through personal contacts, a quality and responsiveness of service can evolve that
never would be achieved through purely official channels.
6.48. Pooling Media. Consider pooling when circumstances such as limited space preclude
accommodating all media wanting to cover a story. Keep in mind most media dislike pool
arrangements and prefer to do their own reporting. A news pool involves having a representative
from the media (or one representative from the various media, such as print, television, and
radio) cover the story and then feed reports to all media taking part in the pool. Use pools only
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                            135


when circumstances absolutely preclude accommodating all interested media. Always let media
decide procedures on how representatives are selected and how stories are distributed.
6.49. Air Force Visual Information Support for Media. The Air Force supports all bona fide
print and electronic media (which include media organizations and their accredited
representatives) requests to release visual information and combat camera products when
such release meets the responsibility to inform the public, and when it does not compromise
national security. Releasable materials are equally available to all interested media. Air Force
stock audiovisual materials or location photography on Air Force facilities are provided to
media without charge when used for news projects.
   6.49.1. Visual Information Policy. Air Force Image Express (AFIE) is a system to capture,
   process and distribute Air Force imagery and video in near real-time to internal and external
   markets worldwide. AFIE provides same-day digital imagery and video of Air Force
   people, locations, weapons systems and missions to a designated group via tape/CD
   distribution and electronically through a file transfer protocol (FTP) service. Contact
   SAF/PA‟s combat camera liaison for more information.

Section 6G—Supporting Media Travel.

6.50. (See Chapter 19, Public Affairs Travel.)

Section 6H—Magazine and Books Support

6.51. Books. SAF/PA and SAF/PA field offices are the points of contact between the Air Force
and book representatives.
   6.51.1. SAF/PA Responsibilities. The New York field office generally handles book
   activities since most publishers have major offices in that city. These responsibilities include:
       6.51.1.1. Responding to requests for available material on Air Force subjects.
       6.51.1.2. Referring requesters to MAJCOM, FOAs, and Air Force record centers and
       depositories.
       6.51.1.3. Coordinating and approving requests from authors with Letters of Intent to
       interview Air Force personnel, visit bases, and participate in media orientation flights.
   6.51.2. MAJCOM Responsibilities. SAF/PA may delegate direct liaison between Air Force
   and book representatives to MAJCOM and FOA or unit level (with MAJCOM or FOA
   coordination and approval) on a case-by-case basis.
       6.51.2.1. Overseas MAJCOMs and FOAs are the liaison with foreign book
       representatives covering subjects solely within their areas of responsibility. Send all
       foreign magazine and book representatives‟ requests for material not available at the
       overseas location to SAF/PA for coordination, support, or concurrence. Advise overseas-
       based foreign book representatives who request to visit CONUS installations to contact
       the press office in their respective U.S. embassies. Appropriate MAJCOMs and FOAs
       are the Air Force focal point for coordination and support after approval by USIA and
       OASD/PA. Public Affairs at every level may support unofficial Air Force authors as
136                                               AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


         they would support civilian writers, and may review submissions for policy and
         technical accuracy, if requested.
6.52. National Magazine Story 1deas. Placement of solid, mission-oriented stories in the
national magazine market are a critical part of the Public Affairs mission.
   6.52.1. Without assigning production goals, MAJCOMs and FOAs encourage Public
   Affairs to develop original story ideas for proposal to national and regional magazines.
   These include trade, technical, fraternal, consumer group, and industrial publications.
   Stories receive official support when they satisfy Air Force Public Affairs requirements;
   that is, the topic must be related to an operational mission on an Air Force organization; or it
   must directly support Air Force programs.
      6.52.2. All Public Affairs people are encouraged to write for national publications as part of
      their official duties. On a voluntary basis, writers may prepare articles while on official duty
      and be credited in print with a by-line. Air Force people may not accept payment for these
      articles.
   6.52.3. Public Affairs screens story ideas for accuracy, quality, security and policy. In
   addition, Public Affairs are responsible for quality control to ensure the final product presents
   a professional image. Contact SAF/PA for assistance in marketing, when appropriate.
   6.52.4. Public Affairs at all levels may contact or send story ideas or articles directly to
   national magazine representatives. Inform SAF/PA of national level media requests.
   6.52.5. Public Affairs screens story ideas for accuracy, quality, security and policy.
6.53. Payment and Honoraria for Writing. Air Force military and civilian professionals are
encouraged to write for publication. Air Force and civilian professionals are not allowed to
receive payment or honoraria for writing produced as part of their official duties. However,
they can accept payment and honoraria, for writings that are done off-duty and are unrelated to
their official duties. Consult the servicing SJA for more information. Refer to DOD 5500.7-R,
Joint Ethics Regulation.
   6.53.1. Air Force people must receive the same service from the PA office as all other
   writers when they write for profit. They must not have access to technical or operational
   military information not available to all. They must not receive payment for materials their
   duties require them to provide at no cost.
6.54. Commercial Use of Published Official Air Force Material. Official U.S. Government-
and contractor-produced unclassified Air Force manuals, symposium papers, and other
documents often provide valuable story material for publishers. Excerpts are frequently
reprinted commercially. If a publisher requests Air Force documents for this purpose, contact
SAF/PAN.

Section 6I—Support for Non-Government, Non-Entertainment VI Productions Other Than
News; Contractor VI Productions; and Commercial Advertisements. These include
commercial and nonprofit industrial, institutional, documentary, educational and commercial
enterprise productions. The key is these productions are intended to inform.

6.55. Visual Information Policy. See AFI 33-117, Multimedia (MM) Management. Per DOD
Instruction 5410.15, Air Force assistance, access to installations, equipment, and personnel for
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                            137


interviews, photo and video opportunities, and unclassified visual information material may be
provided when it is considered beneficial to the Air Force and DOD or is in the national
interest. The following factors are used to make this determination.
   6.55.1. Accuracy in the portrayal of Air Force people, places, equipment, military
   operations and events.
   6.55.2. Information value and enhancement of public understanding of the Air Force,
   DOD and defense issues.
   6.55.3. There should be no explicit or implied Air Force or DOD endorsement of any person,
   product, partisan or political cause or solicitation of any direct contributions to the selective
   benefit of any person or organization.
6.56. General Policy Guidelines.
   6.56.1. Classified information may not be disclosed, nor classified equipment shown.
   6.56.2. Operational readiness must not be impaired. Use of people, equipment and other
   resources will not interfere with military operations or training.
   6.56.3. There will be no deviation from established Air Force safety standards.
   6.56.4. Activities of persons being videotaped, filmed, or photographed will be within the
   scope of their normal duties.
   6.56.5. No additional cost will be incurred by the government to provide assistance.
   6.56.6. Footage shot with Air Force assistance (or by Air Force members) and released to
   support a specific production must not be reused for or sold to other productions without Air
   Force consent.
   6.56.7. Air Force visual information material cannot be provided exclusively to a
   particular group, nor can any organization be given preferential treatment.
   6.56.8. Since the Air Force cannot compete with commercial sources, Air Force support
   may be provided only when similar civilian assets are not reasonably available.
6.57. SAF/PA Responsibilities. SAF/PA evaluates and approves support for national-level,
non-government, and non-entertainment visual information productions. SAF/PA determines
if the VI production meets Air Force and DOD policy and coordinates with OASD/PA.
Requests are generally supported when they serve the Air Force interest, meet guidelines in Air
Force and DOD directives, and are not prohibited by legal or policy restrictions. When a
national production involves more than one MAJCOM, SAF/PA coordinates assistance to
obtain or produce the visual information material. SAF/PA notifies the requester the project is
approved; reiterates policy restrictions and arranges for release of stock footage or puts the
requester in contact with the right POC.
   6.57.1. SAF/PA must approve support for visual information productions involving Air
   Force-level contracts.
6.58. MAJCOM Responsibilities. MAJCOMs approve regional and local requests.
MAJCOMs review, evaluate and determine support for VI productions judged as having regional
and local impact only. Withhold approval until support is coordinated with SAF/PA if it is
138                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


believed interest may expand beyond a regional audience. Keep SAF/PA apprised of
MAJCOM-approved projects.
6.59. Unit Responsibilities. When contacted by a non-government, non-entertainment group
(other than news media) seeking visual information support units forward requests through
channels with a unit recommendation, if appropriate. Provide normal Public Affairs assistance in
the form of advice or guidance. Take care to ensure no commitment of resources is made without
approval.
   6.59.1. Units approve requests for assistance from Air Force contractors when the support
   relates to contract requirements. Contract-associated support should be confirmed with the
   contract administrator. Requests relating to contractor-sponsored photography outside the
   scope of the contract must be sent through channels to SAF/PA.
6.60. Support Procedures.
   6.60.1. Non-Government, Non-Entertainment Visual Information Productions Other
   Than News. Productions done by organizations outside the federal government which are
   primarily intended to inform.
       6.60.1.1. SAF/PA approves support to national-level, non-government, and non-
       entertainment visual information productions other than news media. MAJCOMs
       approve support on the local and regional level. Customers should submit requests in
       writing as outlined below.
           6.60.1.1.1. Include detailed description of the desired material stock footage or
           photography (footage format, amount, etc.); desired receipt date (two to four weeks
           is normal processing times).
           6.60.1.1.2. If production support is requested, include anticipated specific support
           requirements, such as military manpower and equipment, and projected production
           schedule, including filming dates and proposed filming locations.
           6.60.1.1.3. A synopsis or explanation of the product in which the Air Force visual
           information material will be used. Include a treatment, outline, script or storyboard
           for the project.
           6.60.1.1.4. A description of the use of the product to include distribution mode
           and target audience (e.g., national TV advertisement; 30-minute TV documentary
           to air nationally on PBS; etc.).
           6.60.1.1.5. A statement that the requested visual information support cannot be
           reasonably obtained from commercial or private sources.
           6.60.1.1.6. A statement that the finished product will not imply Air Force or DOD
           sponsorship, approval or endorsement of the organization or company, its products
           or services, nor will it state or imply Air Force or DOD support of any viewpoint
           expressed in the product.
           6.60.1.1.7. A statement that SAF/PA (or appropriate level) will be given the
           opportunity to review the final product before release.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                        139


   6.60.2. Contractor Visual Information Productions. These are products by Air Force and
   DOD contractors such as annual reports, corporate in-house training videos and
   promotional and marketing productions.
      6.60.2.1. Government contracts often include visual information productions that address
      the contract program. Contractors are responsible for clearing their produced print and
      electronic promotional, marketing and advertising material before public release.
      Subjects of material that requires OASD/PA and SAF/PA clearance are listed in DODD
      5230.9, Clearance of DOD Information for Public Release. Material not requiring
      OASD/PA or SAF/PA clearance will be cleared at the lowest level competent to evaluate
      the information.
      6.60.2.2. Contractors seeking visual information material for a production must certify in
      writing that funding of the production will not be billed to the government unless the
      production itself is being done pursuant to a government contract that authorizes such
      costs.
   6.60.3. Commercial Advertisements. These are requests by advertising agencies for Air
   Force materials or assistance in campaigns designed to sell a particular product, service or
   company.
      6.60.3.1. DOD is prohibited from endorsing or appearing to endorse or selectively
      benefit any particular product, company or commercial concern. Because of this, the Air
      Force generally does not support commercial advertising unless the Air Force uses the
      product or service being advertised. The requester must show a specific tie between the
      Air Force and the advertised item. Proof can be via valid contract numbers or other
      verifiable information that shows their company does provide the advertised goods or
      services to the Air Force. Any request for Air Force support for a commercial
      advertisement must be coordinated through SAF/PA. In all cases, a proposed
      advertisement must meet the policy guidelines and the following:
      6.60.3.2. Must be factual and in good taste.
      6.60.3.3. Must be of some benefit to the Air Force (informational value, enhancement
      of public understanding, etc.)
      6.60.3.4. Must not state or imply Air Force endorsement or preference of one
      product over another. Such terms as “government approved” or “Air Force certified”
      must not be used.
      6.60.3.5. Must not compare the relative merits of current weapons or weapons systems.
      6.60.3.6. Must not refer to the economic impact of a proposed continuation or
      cancellation of a defense contract.
      6.60.3.7. Must not reproduce the Air Force seal or any of its parts, except as
      authorized by AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official Communications.
      6.60.3.8. Active-duty Air Force military and civilian personnel may not use their title or
      position to: endorse commercial products, services, or activities; assume
      responsibility for advertising claims; or obtain personal gain.

Section 6J—Support for Non-Government Entertainment Productions
140                                            AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


6.61. Television, Motion Picture, Other Entertainment Production Policy. This section
covers policies governing Air Force assistance to non-government entertainment productions,
including motion pictures released via box office, DVD and direct-to-video; television
movies; television series and mini-series, on network, cable and syndicated television; as well
as theatrical productions. These productions are primarily intended to entertain. The SAF/PA
field office in Los Angeles is the OPR for liaising with the entertainment industry on Air Force-
related projects.
   6.61.1. Policy. DOD Instruction 5410.16, DOD Assistance to Non-Government
   Entertainment-Oriented Motion Picture, Television and Video Productions, authorizes
   assistance to an entertainment-oriented motion picture, television, DVD or video
   production when cooperation benefits DOD or when this would be in the best national
   interest, based on consideration of the following factors:
       6.61.1.1. The production must be authentic in its portrayal of actual persons, places,
       military operations, and historical events. Fictional portrayals must depict a feasible
       interpretation of military life, operations and policies.
       6.61.1.2. The production is of informational value and considered to be in the best
       interest of public understanding of the U.S. Armed Forces and DOD.
       6.61.1.3. The production may enhance the U.S. Armed Forces‟ recruiting and retention
       programs.
       6.61.1.4. The production should not appear to condone or endorse activities by private
       citizens or organizations when such activities are contrary to U.S. Government policy.
6.62. General Policy Guidelines. In addition to the policy guidance listed above, the following
policies apply to entertainment projects.
   6.62.1. The production company must reimburse the Air Force for any additional expenses
   incurred as a result of assistance rendered. The Air Force organization that owns the
   resources expended or equipment involved during assistance should present its bill to the
   production company through the field office project officer.
   6.62.2. Diversion of equipment, personnel and material resources from normal Air Force
   locations and operations must be kept to a minimum and must not interfere with military
   operations.
   6.62.3. There shall be no deviation from established DOD safety standards.
   6.62.4. Official activities of military personnel assisting the production must be within their
   scope of normal duties, with the exception of field office-assigned project officer(s) and
   technical advisor(s).
   6.62.5. Official personnel services and DOD materiel shall not be employed in such a
   manner as to compete directly with commercial and private enterprises. DOD assets may be
   provided when similar civilian assets are not reasonably available.
   6.62.6. All government property and facilities used in the production shall be restored by the
   production company to the same or better condition as when they were made available for the
   company‟s use.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           141


   6.62.7. Before filming, the production company must provide proof of adequate industry
   standard liability insurance for any possible damages to the Air Force.
   6.62.8. The production company must sign a DOD Production Assistance Agreement, which
   includes a hold harmless clause that releases the government from liability in case of
   accident, injury or loss of property in connection with Air Force assistance to the project. The
   DOD Production Agreement lists each installation used for filming.
   6.62.9. DOD motion picture and video stock footage may be made available for purchase
   or loan when a production qualifies for assistance under the general factors outlined in
   6.60.1
   6.62.10. Footage shot with DOD assistance and official DOD footage released for a specific
   production are not to be reused for or sold to other productions without DOD approval.
6.63. Responsibilities. Pending final approval of Air Force cooperation, Public Affairs may
provide production companies information or suggestions and access to unclassified
technical research. Public Affairs must make it clear that interim help does not commit the Air
Force to final approval and official support of the project.
   6.63.1. OASD/PA-Special Assistant for Entertainment Media. Serves as the sole authority for
   approving DOD assistance to non-government, entertainment-oriented motion picture,
   television, DVD and video productions. The Special Assistant for Entertainment Media is
   herein referred to as OASD/PA.
   6.63.2. SAF/PA. Serves as the Air Force approval authority for official support before
   elevating requests to OASD/PA for DOD-level approval. The Los Angeles field office serves
   as the entry point for all requests, reviews and coordinates support requirements with
   MAJCOMs, makes qualifying recommendation to OASD/PA and is ultimately charged with
   preparing, coordinating and executing a DOD Production Assistance Agreement. Before a
   production company officially submits a project to OASD/PA, the field office may provide
   advice and courtesy assistance that might ultimately help to qualify the project for support.
   However, no premature commitments may be made. The field office also provides the
   production company a copy of DODI 5410.16, DOD Assistance to Non-Government
   Entertainment-Oriented Motion Picture, Television and Video Productions.
   6.63.3. MAJCOM. Reviews requests and makes recommendations to the LA field office, to
   include MAJCOM and local unit ability to support. MAJCOMs ensure required documents
   are accomplished for their units before filming is allowed.
   6.63.4. Unit. If initially contacted by a representative from the entertainment industry (to
   include TV and motion picture companies, and city and state film commission offices), the
   unit should coordinate with its MAJCOM and contact the LA field office in-turn before
   agreeing to anything. If contacted by SAF/PA or MAJCOMs concerning projects already
   under LA field office review, units should advise MAJCOMs of their ability to support.
   6.63.5. Production company. The production company collaborates and coordinates with the
   LA field office to develop the project ultimately for OASD/PA approval of production
   assistance by the Air Force.
6.64. Procedures for Approval and Support. Before a production company officially submits
a project to OASD/PA for support consideration, the LA field office may provide courtesy
142                                              AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


assistance, as in project research and development, thereby helping the production company to
develop a script that might ultimately qualify for DOD assistance.
   6.64.1. The production company must submit to OASD/PA, via the field office, a formal
   request for production assistance, which should include:
         6.64.1.1. A letter describing the proposal to produce a specific motion picture, television
         program or video product, stating the project objectives and identifiable benefits for
         DOD.
         6.64.1.2. A statement acknowledging the producer has read and agrees to abide by
         DODI5410.16, DOD Assistance to Non-Government Entertainment-Oriented Motion
         Picture, Television and Video Productions.
         6.64.1.3. Five copies of the script for review and evaluation.
         6.64.1.4. A detailed list of requirements. If not yet known, requirements should be
         stated in general terms.
   6.64.2. The LA field office reviews the request and determines initial support feasibility
   and, when necessary, coordinates with appropriate Air Staff agencies and MAJCOMs. Any
   comments, changes or problems are resolved by the field office and recommendation for
   approval or disapproval is sent to OASD/PA.
         6.64.2.1. Support approval or disapproval will be communicated to the producer by
         OASD/PA or the LA field office.
         6.64.2.2. Once support approval is granted, if the original request submitted was not
         complete as far as final scripting or specific support requirements, these must be
         coordinated and approved by the LA field office and OASD/PA as soon as possible
         thereafter.
   6.64.3. Once a project is granted OASD/PA approval, the LA field office is authorized to
   provide official production support through an assigned project officer. The field office
   can assist with script review and rewrite, filming location arrangements, stock footage
   research and acquisition, on-site technical advice, handling of insurance and
   reimbursement arrangements, and review of completed projects.
6.65. Use of Air Force People as Extras. Air Force people who appear in non-government
entertainment-oriented productions (non-news) must do so voluntarily, whether on duty or off
duty.
      6.65.1. If they are performing normal duties during the time of the production, the Airmen
      are said to be on duty and cannot be paid by the producer, but they are not required to
      participate.
   6.65.2. If they are not performing normal duties while taking part in the production, they
   must be off duty. Military personnel in an off-duty, non-official status may be hired by the
   production company to perform as actors, extras, etc., provided there is no conflict with any
   other Air Force instruction. In such cases, contractual arrangements are solely between
   those individuals and production company; however, payment should be commensurate
   with current industry standards. Military personnel accepting such employment shall
   comply with DODD 5500.7, Standards of Conduct (reference “d”).
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         143


   6.65.3. The production company is responsible for resolving any disputes with unions
   governing the hiring of non-union actors and extras.

Section 6K—Member Participation in Non-Government Talk, Reality and Game/Quiz Shows

6.66. General Guidance. Air Force members may participate in non-government talk, reality
and game/ quiz shows given the considerations and coordination outlined below, when such
participation does not detract from the dignity and prestige of the Air Force.
   6.66.1. The following factors should be weighed in favor of participation when appropriate:
       6.66.1.1. The show is devoted entirely to observing a national holiday, or is dedicated to
       the U.S. Armed Forces or a particular service.
       6.66.1.2. The show is local and originates entirely from a military installation.
       6.66.1.3. The appearance of Air Force personnel is for a purpose that has no commercial
       counterpart, or that contributes to a specific Air Force interest.
       6.66.1.4. The show supports national interests.
       6.66.1.5. Members may appear when they are newsworthy in their own right, or when
       appearing as an Air Force official to provide information on Air Force subjects to the
       listening or viewing audience.
       6.66.1.6. A show‟s sponsors or business practices do not reflect adversely on the Air
       Force.
   6.66.2. Coordination with Public Affairs.
       6.66.2.1. A member must coordinate with his or her base-level Public Affairs office if
       he or she intends to participate either in or out of uniform, in or out of official duty
       status or by expressly presenting him or herself as a member of the Air Force.
       6.66.2.2. The base-level Public Affairs office should in-turn inform its MAJCOM,
       which should in-turn coordinate with SAF/PA as outlined below based on the type of
       show.
6.67. Talk and Reality Shows. SAF/PA is the OPR for coordination and approval of an Air
Force member‟s participation on a talk and reality show. Member participation is approved on a
case-by-case basis as determined by SAF/PA.
6.68. Participation in Commercials. Participation in endorsing or marketing any commercial
products is strictly prohibited. If necessary, SAF/PA is also the OPR for coordination of an Air
Force member‟s participation and involvement in all commercials depicting any relationship
with a product and the Air Force or any Airman.
6.69. Game/Quiz Shows. The LA field office is the OPR for coordinating a member‟s
participation on a game/quiz show.
   6.69.1. Military-Themed Game/Quiz Shows. When a military installation takes an active
   role in providing military contestants, approvals by the LA field office and OASD/PA are
   necessary for military members‟ participation (other than as audience members only),
   whether appearing in or out of uniform. Military personnel selected as game or quiz show
   participants should be placed in a leave or other authorized off-duty status.
144                                         AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   6.69.2. Non-Military Themed Game/Quiz Shows. Military personnel who independently go
   to a studio to be a member of a game or quiz show audience and are selected out of the
   audience for participation are allowed to wear their uniform as long as their appearance
   does not give the impression of DOD or Air Force endorsement. If randomly selected,
   military members should inform their unit Public Affairs office as soon as possible, which
   should in-turn inform its MAJCOM and the LA field office.

                                           Chapter 7

                                 CRISIS COMMUNICATION

Section 7A—Purpose, Objectives and Planning

7.1. Purpose of Crisis Communication. Building, maintaining, and strengthening trusted
counsel to leaders, Airman morale and readiness, and public trust and support is critical during
crisis communication. Crises is a rapidly developing threat to U.S. vital interests that is of such
a nature that commitment of U.S. military forces and resources is contemplated in order to
achieve national objectives.       Public Affairs must be ready to provide leaders with
recommended courses of action to provide target audiences with accurate information. Public
Affairs demands trained professionals have the skills to engage the media, and keep Airmen
and the public informed during crises.
7.2. Objectives of Crisis Communication.
   7.2.1. Establish procedures which prepare Public Affairs to handle any crisis communication
   issue.
   7.2.2. Provide Public Affairs rules of engagement for the proper release of information
   during crises.
7.3. Planning and Preparation. MAJCOMs and FOAs must prepare comprehensive
Public Affairs accident plans, or supplements to this instruction, for both nuclear and non-
nuclear accidents. These plans must include provisions for adequate personnel, administrative,
communication, and logistical support for a nuclear accident or incident Immediate Reaction
Forces (IRF). Plans must agree with AFI 10-2501, Full Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR)
Planning and Operations, which establishes requirements for local responses, and AFI 91-204,
Safety Investigations and Reports, that describes mishap investigation management after initial
response. MAJCOM, FOA and DRU Public Affairs should coordinate with SAF/PA when
activating accident plans. Base-level Public Affairs offices should coordinate with the
appropriate MAJCOM, which will notify SAF/PA.
   7.3.1. Unclassified Information. It is Air Force policy to give the public unclassified
   information on all activities subject to the guidance in paragraph 7.6 Provide free,
   accurate and timely release of news--good and bad--to recognized news media. Promptly
   release unclassified facts about accidents and incidents, including near misses or missing
   aircraft, consistent with national security responsibilities.
   7.3.2. Classified Information. Federal IAW and Executive Order 12356 require protection of
   classified information. Air Force people must protect classified information against
   compromise as required. The on-scene commander, with the advice of the security police
   representative, will provide initial guidance to the PA representative when it is determined
   classified information is involved. However, there are limits to Air Force authority at an
   accident site, particularly away from Air Force installations. Civilian police enforce
   Federal, State, and foreign criminal IAW.
7.4. Requirements Explained.
146                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


  7.4.1. Media Operations Center. Establish a centrally located media operations center
  (MOC), as needed, for news media representatives. Do not collocate the media center and
  the PA office. The MOC must have enough commercial lines to serve anticipated media
  representatives, plus at least one commercial line for PA personnel only. Consider having
  several computer modems available, a fax machine, and additional telephone lines to
  accommodate media requirements.
  7.4.2. Straight Talk Center. Establish a Straight Talk Center to provide base personnel
  with an authoritative point of contact for current, accurate information about the status of any
  disturbance, and the command‟s actions. PA personnel and augmentees will perform such
  tasks as preparing fact sheets, messages for automatic telephone answering devices (if
  used), e-mail messages, straight talk Web page on the intranet, and news articles for base
  newspapers. Also, make updated statements available to base telephone operators.
      7.4.2.1. Publicize the existence of the Straight Talk Center both before and during an on-
      base disturbance by the internal information program, newsletters, base bulletins, and
      meetings of equal opportunity and human relations councils.
      7.4.2.2. Straight Talk Center must have enough telephone lines to provide at least one
      dial-out only line (Class A), plus at least one with direct commercial dial-out capability
      for PA personnel. When available, use answering service systems incorporated into base
      telephone exchange facilities for the Straight Talk Center‟s automatic answering service.
   7.4.3. Initial Response Element (IRE). Because media often arrive at off-base accidents
   before the IRE, include a PA person in that IRE. This individual must be prepared to aid in
   safeguarding classified information from the media within legal and policy guidelines.
      7.4.3.1. Disaster Control Group (DCG). For on-base accidents and incidents, a PA
      representative should be designated to respond with the Disaster Control Group.
   7.4.4. National Defense Area (NDA). An NDA is the temporary establishment in the United
   States of Federal areas for the protection or security of DOD resources (Title 50, United
   States Code, Section 797). If the off-base site is designated as an NDA, support news media
   representatives as on a military installation. Brief the media on appropriate disclosable
   information during a nuclear accident or incident and the procedures to be followed, such as
   escort requirements.
   7.4.5. Jurisdiction. In the United States, Public Affairs officers must respect the
   jurisdiction and interests of all concerned government agencies at national, state, and local
   levels to include additional coordination which may be required with the Departments of
   Justice and State, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Federal Aviation
   Administration (FAA).
  7.4.6. Transportation Requirements. Mobility is vital during a disturbance. The Public
  Affairs officer must request sufficient vehicles and land mobile radios for on-base internal
  information program support and vehicles for media through the base disturbance
  contingency plan. Certify PA personnel to drive these vehicles.
   7.4.7. Additional Duties. Do not assign PA personnel to other operational duties during a
   natural disaster, on-base disturbance, crisis situation, accident, or serious incident.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                          147


   7.4.8. Installations Without Public Affairs Officers. Major commands and FOAs must
   ensure that commanders of units without primary duty Public Affairs officers understand the
   need to release accident information to the news media on a timely basis. MAJCOM/PA
   should ensure commanders have established notification procedures between the unit and
   their supporting public affairs office.
   7.4.9. Crisis Notification. Report operational incidents or events using OPREP-3. Ensure
   command post procedures exist to notify Public Affairs duty officers of known or suspected
   incidents or events. PA organizations at all levels must ensure that local command post
   procedures exist to notify the PA duty personnel of a known or suspected incident. To
   confirm notification, inform the PA duty officer at the next higher level of command of the
   incident.
   7.4.10. Overseas Precedence. When instructions or plans of a combatant command conflict
   with this instruction in procedural detail (such as naming a release authority for confirming a
   nuclear accident) or with host nation sensitivities, use the combatant command plan.
   7.4.11. Exemption from MINIMIZE.              When disturbance contingency plans are
   implemented, the commander may impose MINIMIZE to reduce the flow of voice and
   message traffic. Requirements in MINIMIZE instructions must include exemption of
   disturbance of PA voice and message traffic. These exemptions allow the Public Affairs
   officer to meet the rapid response requirements of SAF/PA and OASD/PA.

Section 7B—Crisis Procedures and Release of Information

7.5. Procedures. In significant weapon system mishaps, Public Affairs should be in place
at the PA office, the accident scene, and the installation command post.
   7.5.1. When the accident occurs off the installation in an area accessible to the media, a PA
   person must arrive at the site at the same time as the OSC and the IRF. Public Affairs
   officers must ensure unit contingency plans include transportation to the accident site via
   arrival with the DCG during on-base accidents/incidents.
   7.5.2. Regardless of location, establish communication at once between the on-scene PA
   representative and those at the installation. This permits Public Affairs at the site and those
   at the PA office to coordinate information for release on a timely basis.
   7.5.3. The host Public Affairs office must establish procedures to notify a tenant unit
   commander of any follow-on PA actions in accidents involving that commander‟s resources.
   7.5.4. In accidents or incidents likely to require Public Affairs support for extended periods
   of time, or likely to exceed the capabilities of the responsible PA office, Public Affairs
   should:
      7.5.4.1. Set up a 24-hour news media operations center. If other federal, state, and local
      response force Public Affairs officers are on scene, the media center should be a joint
      operation.
      7.5.4.2. Give Air Force news releases about the accident to state, local, or other officials
      responsible for informing the public and media, or who needs the releases for any other
      purpose.
148                                            AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


      7.5.4.3. Anticipate public concerns and issues news releases before such concerns
      distort public perceptions.
      7.5.4.4. Ask the next higher PA echelon for additional people and equipment if needed.
      7.5.4.5. Have each PA staff member record media, and public queries on AF Form 39,
      Response to Query.
      7.5.4.6. Use a central log to record: Time of accident, important developments, time of
      releases, policy received from higher PA echelons and how or when it was
      implemented, and thumbnail sketches of most significant queries and events.
      7.5.4.7. Alert switchboard operators to direct all news media and public calls to the
      media center.
      7.5.4.8. Ensure major command and Air Force News Service are included as addressees
      on initial information release and other publicly releasable information and images.
7.6. Release of Personal 1nformation. This section provides guidelines for the release of
personal information about victims of accidents, incidents, disturbances, and disasters.
   7.6.1. Names of Survivors. Generally, release the names of all survivors immediately. Make
   releases quickly, to relieve the fears of people with kin in the accident, and also to ease the
   concern of families and friends of other individuals flying similar aircraft or on similar duty
   in the vicinity.
      7.6.1.1. Report information on survivors who are believed to be in immediate danger of
      dying as survived but in critical condition. Public Affairs must ensure releases do not
      invade the personal privacy of the victims or relatives (see AFI 33-332, Privacy Act
      Program).
      7.6.1.2. If, in the judgment of the commander, releasing survivors‟ names would reveal
      the identity of deceased individuals prior to next of kin notification (in the case of crew
      members known by their families to customarily fly together, for example), the
      survivors‟ names may be withheld. Do this only when the potential for the next of kin
      deducing their loss through news stories about the survivors is so strong that the
      circumstances clearly warrant leaving other families in suspense.
   7.6.2. Names of People Aboard Aircraft Missing or Presumed Lost. When an Air Force
   aircraft, including a contract or charter flight, is officially declared missing or crashes in a
   remote area, the PA office at the departure base will release the names of passengers and crew
   to news media individually, as the next of kin are notified. This should not delay the
   announcement that the aircraft is missing.
   7.6.3. Names of Persons Admitted to Military Medical Facilities. Public Affairs should
   coordinate responses to query or news releases about the admittance or status of patients
   with the military treatment facility‟s privacy officer (each location is required to have an
   individual acting in this capacity).
   7.6.4. Names of Deceased. The responsible installation Public Affairs office releases the
   names of people killed in Air Force accidents according to the following rules:
      7.6.4.1. In accordance with, DoDI 1300.18 “Military Personnel Casualty Matters,
      Policies and Procedures” no casualty information on deceased military personnel may be
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         149


     released to the media or the general public until 24 hours after notifying next-of-kin
     regarding the casualty status of the member.
     7.6.4.2. When a military accident in a civilian community causes significant property
     damage or civilian loss of life, the commander may release the names of Air Force
     members killed in the accident before their next of kin have been notified. This is only
     done when, in the judgment of the commander, the needs of the public outweigh any
     potential distress of the victim‟s next of kin. This may be necessary when the
     commander needs to immediately reassure the community the Air Force members were
     well qualified and experienced, or when civilian authorities need information on the
     members to identify the accident victims‟ remains.
     7.6.4.3. Releasable information includes gender; Air Force specialty code (AFSC);
     military grade and rank; civilian grade; military base pay and all allowances except basic
     allowance for housing (BAH); civilian gross salary; current and past assignments; date
     of rank (DOR); extended active duty (EAD) date; pay date; source of commission;
     professional military education (PME); military awards and decorations; duty status,
     attendance at technical, scientific, or professional meetings; and in the case of key
     personnel, biographies and photographs.
     7.6.4.4. Non-releasable information includes home of record, home address; home
     telephone number, date of birth; marital status; number and gender of family members;
     civilian education degree, and year of graduation; and civilian awards, or race. If in
     doubt, consult the local SJA.
  7.6.5. Release of Information When More Than One Service Is Involved. In joint exercises
  or operations, the joint command Public Affairs officer is responsible for all PA actions. In
  all other cases, if circumstances permit, the parent service of the involved aircraft or vessel
  makes the initial announcement of the accident. If this is not feasible because of location or
  time constraints, any other service directly involved may assist media as necessary,
  including release of facts. The responding service must keep the parent service PA
  informed. Once an official statement is released by the parent service, other services
  involved may release a full description of their own participation, such as rescue or
  disaster relief activities.
     7.6.5.1. Release specific casualty information according to parent service‟s regulations.
     Names and numbers of casualties are released by the service to which the casualties
     belong. When time does not permit and facts are obvious to the public, any other
     service involved in the operation may announce, when queried, only the number of
     dead, number of survivors, and number of injured. If possible release all services‟
     casualty names simultaneously.
  7.6.6. Names of Foreign Nationals. When a foreign national (other than a locally hired
  employee) is an accident casualty while under Air Force auspices, Air Force officials will
  not release the name without host nation coordination and confirmation that next-of-kin
  notifications have taken place. When the foreign national is locally employed by a host
  nation agency, that agency‟s rules take precedence. Overseas MAJCOMs must develop policy
  for releasing names of local national U.S. Air Force employees injured on duty.
150                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   7.6.7. Key U.S. and Foreign Government Persons. Because of national and international
   interest and implications, carefully coordinate the release of casualty information
   concerning key U.S. Government personnel or equivalent rank foreign government visitors.
   When the following key persons are killed, injured, or listed as missing while on an Air
   Force installation or traveling in an Air Force vehicle or aircraft, notify OASD/PA press desk
   for public announcement by the White House Press Secretary:
      7.6.7.1. The President of the United States
      7.6.7.2. The Vice President of the United States
      7.6.7.3. Speaker of the House of Representatives
      7.6.7.4. President Pro Tempore of the Senate
      7.6.7.5. Members of the Cabinet
      7.6.7.6. Foreign visitors of political or royal rank equivalent to the above list of U.S.
      officials, and chiefs of foreign military services
      7.6.7.7. U.S. Senators
      7.6.7.8. U.S. Representatives
      7.6.7.9. Secretaries of the Military Departments
      7.6.7.10. The Joint Chiefs of Staff
      7.6.7.11. Commanders of combatant and specified commands
      7.6.7.12. Federal Government department heads
      7.6.7.13. The installation PA office withholds casualty information on the following
      officials until OASD/PA approves. Other military officers and civilian employees in the
      grades of Lieutenant General, GS-18, Senior Executive Service Precedent Priority
      Code DV4, and above. (SAF/PA may authorize releasing casualty information before
      securing OASD/PA approval if specific by-name queries are received. Only do this
      when OASD/PA approval is not available in time to meet immediate needs.)
      7.6.7.14. When it is necessary to telephone OASD/PA directly about releasing casualty
      information on key personnel, send an immediate confirmation message to OASD/PA,
      with SAF/PA and any intermediate headquarters as information addressees. Coordinate
      with the U.S. Embassy or Consulate to ensure the host government is notified of
      accidents occurring outside the United States.
7.7. The Air Force Hotline.
   7.7.1. During wartime, or operations other than war, SAF/PA can activate the Air Force
   Hotline. The Hotline is an Air Force public affairs program. It uses a toll-free number
   giving the American public a single point of contact for information about Air Force
   participation in the situation being supported. The Hotline disseminates only releasable
   information that‟s factual and timely. Information released will follow Public Affairs
   policies that are consistent with national security, operational considerations, operations
   security (OPSEC), communications security (COMSEC) and Computer Security
   (COMPUSEC).
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                             151


   7.7.2. Any Air Force major command or Air Staff organization may request activation of
   the Air Force Hotline through SAF/PA. Following the request, SAF/PA will direct HQ
   AFNEWS/CC to activate the Hotline and will include the initial releasable information to be
   used with the Hotline with the activation order.
   7.7.3. SAF/PA, major command, the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC), AFNEWS,
   numbered air force and wing Public Affairs officials will supply timely copies of all
   subsequent releasable information concerning the operation or event to the Air Force Hotline
   for use during operation of the Hotline.
   7.7.4. AFNEWS is responsible for the policies, procedures and guidance for activation,
   operation and management of the Air Force Hotline. Once activated, the Hotline will operate
   24 hours a day, seven days a week until directed by SAF/PA to alter or terminate.
   AFNEWS/CC may recommend termination of Hotline activities based on a decline in the
   frequency of calls to the Hotline.

Section 7C—Controlling Photography

7.8. On U.S. Military 1nstallations During Crises. If no classified material is exposed, the
commander will permit news media photography. Public Affairs may not release official Air
Force accident photographs that show classified information, bodies, or parts of bodies. It does
not mean the presence of bodies is in itself a reason to prohibit media photography.
   7.8.1. Classified Material. If classified information or materials are exposed and cannot be
   covered or removed immediately, media or visitors will not be allowed to photograph or
   videotape in the area. As soon as reasonably possible, the appropriate agency will cover
   exposed classified objects and information in order to allow escorted media to photograph or
   videotape the site. The commander and Public Affairs will:
       7.8.1.1. Notify media or visitors of any restrictions with regard to what can and cannot
       be filmed in a given area or activity or, of the situation. Bar or restrict media and visitors
       from sensitive sites or activities.
       7.8.1.2. Immediately notify security forces of suspected photography of classified
       material by media or visitors. Security forces will confiscate film, digital memory
       devices, and videotape and provide a receipt for any materials seized. Do not detain the
       media or visitor.
           7.8.1.2.1. Coordinate closely with command officials to confirm the existence of
           classified information on the seized materials, review the coverage and return all
           portions that do not contain classified information.
       7.8.1.3. Immediately notify the local Air Force Office of Special Investigations
       (AFOSI) for its determination as to whether an AFOSI investigation is warranted if it is
       determined that:
           7.8.1.3.1. The coverage contains classified information and in some cases,
           AFOSI will develop and review the content, and will handle further necessary
           coordination on processing classified information. AFOSI will review and
           electronically edit classified information from the media coverage.
152                                            AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


           7.8.1.3.2. If it appears there was an intent to deliberately obtain coverage of
           classified information for purposes of profit, espionage or to have any other
           significant adverse impact on national security, the Air Force, base or command
           officials should immediately report the above actions to OASD/PA, through normal
           PA channels.
7.9. Appropriate and Professional Photography. Public Affairs will always be responsible
and aware of the professionalism of all photography gathered on and off base in relation to Air
Force activities. Special attention will be placed on photography of prisoners, wounded or killed
personnel.
7.10. Control of Photography at an Off-Base Location in the United States and its
Territories. T h e authority of PA personnel, on-scene commanders (OSCs), accident boards,
and security forces is limited in dealing with media, particularly at an accident site outside
an installation, unless it is declared a national defense area.
   7.10.1. The senior Air Force representative at the scene must find out, as soon as possible, if
   there is any identifiable classified information present.
   7.10.2. If no classified information is exposed, or if it has been covered or removed, the
   senior Air Force representative authorizes media photography. Public Affairs representatives
   will use identified safe routes to escort media to a safe viewpoint of the scene, allow
   photography, provide statements to media from cleared press releases, and coordinate all
   media queries, to include interview requests. If photography of the incident scene is not
   initially an option, consider as an interim solution allowing media to photograph and report
   from a checkpoint where emergency responders are entering.
   7.10.3. If undetermined whether classified information is exposed, explain that fact to any
   media photographers at the scene and advise them no photography is authorized. Warn
   them taking pictures without permission may violate federal IAW and, if possible, identify
   them for future investigative purposes if they persist.
   7.10.4. If classified information is exposed and cannot be covered or removed, the senior
   Air Force representative must:
       7.10.4.1. Explain the situation and ask the media to cooperate.
       7.10.4.2. Explain federal IAW prohibits photography when official permission is
       expressly withheld (Title 18, United States Code, Sections 795 and 797).
       7.10.4.3. Do not use force if media representatives refuse to cooperate unless declared an
       NDA. If photographs are taken after a warning is issued, Air Force officials must ask
       civilian IAW enforcement authorities to stop further photography of the exposed
       classified information, and to collect all materials with that coverage.
   7.10.5. If no civilian IAW enforcement authorities are on the scene and media
   representatives take unauthorized pictures, do not seize the materials or hold the
   photographer. Instead, the senior Air Force official at the scene or the responsible Air Force
   installation commander must:
       7.10.5.1. Immediately contact the managing editor or news director of the newspaper,
       magazine, or television station employing the photographer.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                              153


       7.10.5.2. Explain the situation.
       7.10.5.3. Request the return of media coverage having suspected classified information.
       7.10.5.4. Explain failure to return the material to military authorities violates federal IAW
       (Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793(e), 795,797).
       7.10.5.5. Review media coverage turned over to the Air Force.
       7.10.5.6. Report the action by telephone and follow-up message, when such contact
       is made, through normal PA channels to OASDIPA.
7.11. Liaison With Media. Accidents occurring off an installation are under state and local
authorities‟ control. Officials often rope off an area to protect the public from injury or to
protect government property from further disturbance. When this is done, the OSC must
coordinate media access to the accident site with civilian officials.
   7.11.1. If possible, brief the media on safety hazards in the area and the need for preserving
   the site for investigation, and consider escorting media representatives. Air Force
   personnel do not have authority to physically restrict movement of media representatives.
7.12. Control of Photography Off-Base in a Foreign Country. Air Force officials at the
scene must comply with status of forces agreements, the IAWs of the host nation, and other
instructions of the combatant commander responsible for that area. Overseas MAJCOM
commanders will publish supplements to this instruction that state policy on relations with
media at accident sites.

Section 7D—Aircraft, Missile and Space Accidents--Non-nuclear

7.13. 1nitial News Release. Write a news release within an hour after notification of an
accident. The release should include as much of the following information as possible. Note:
If all the information listed below is not available, release the information you have. Refer to
Figure 7.1 through Figure 7.1 The news release should be sent to SAF/PA and Air Force News
Service (news@afnews.af.mil) in addition to local and regional media.
   7.13.1. A general description of the type of accident (crash, mid-air collision, space launch
   mishap, etc.).
   7.13.2. The time and location.
   7.13.3. The aircraft, space launch vehicle‟s or missile‟s departure/launch point and
   destination or, in the case of satellites, intended orbit (unless that information is classified or
   foreign country sensitivity precludes release).
   7.13.4. The number of crewmembers and passengers aboard.
   7.13.5. The type of aircraft, space launch vehicle/satellite or missile. Withhold this
   information if the aircraft or missile is an experimental type that has not been publicly
   announced or is on a classified mission and an exact description would reveal the nature of
   that mission. In these cases, release a general description (for example: “...an Air Force jet
   aircraft...”).
   7.13.6. Release unclassified facts about the mission the aircraft and crew were on when the
   accident occurred. Avoid non-descriptive phrases, such as “on a routine training flight.”
  154                                              AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


       Instead, describe the purpose of the flight (for example: the specific training involved) and
       give as many facts about the mission as security permits.
       7.13.7. A board of officers will investigate the accident. See paragraphs 7.14 through 7.16
       for guidance on answering queries about this board‟s findings and the cause of the accident.
       7.13.8. If accident occurs overseas, ensure embassy coordination is obtained prior to release.

(NOTE: This release may be modified for other types of accidents)

 7.14. Accident Investigations. Commanders and PA representatives must not speculate about
 the possible causes of the accident, even if the cause seems obvious. If pressed by a reporter,
 explain only an accident board is qualified to determine the causes. Explain the processes for
 the safety investigation board and the accident investigation board. The SIB report is not
 releasable. The AIB report is releasable.
 7.15. Safety Investigation Board (SIB). SIBs are conducted to prevent future mishaps.
 Safety investigations take priority over accident investigations because of the need to quickly
 assess the impact on a weapons system‟s ability to fulfill its national defense role. The SIB
 convenes within days of the mishap and has approximately 30 days to return its assessment.
 Safety investigators are given wide-ranging freedoms to assist in quickly moving to conclusion.
 For example, SIBs have the authority to take testimony under promise of confidentiality and to
 deliberate on causes and recommendations without bearing a substantial burden of proof. The
 SIB‟s conclusions reflect the best professional judgment of the board members. SIB members
 are specifically selected because of their intimate familiarity with the maintenance, operation,
 employment roles and mission of the weapon system involved in the mishap.
     7.15.1. The SIB report is in two parts. The first part is factual and passed to the Accident
     Investigation Board to be incorporated into its report in its entirety. The second part is
     privileged, meaning it is to be used solely for mishap prevention and is restricted from release
     outside the Air Force. The privileged portion contains testimony taken under promise of
     confidentiality; private individual medical material and a record of the SIB‟s deliberations.
     7.15.2. If a media representative requests the SIB report, direct the representative to the
     convening authority of the accident investigation. Tell the requester the releasable portions
     of the SIB report are in the AIB report. If no accident investigation was conducted, media
     representatives may apply in writing to AFSC/IMR, 9700 Avenue G, SE, Suite 235A, Bldg.
     24499, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5670, for a copy of the releasable information. Findings,
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                            157


   including determination of causes and recommendations, will not be in the material released.
   Reports generally are not available until 60 to 90 calendar days after an accident.
7.16. Accident Investigation Board (AIB). The AIB is also appointed immediately and
begins its investigation as soon as it can do so without interfering with the SIB. The board
president is a senior pilot, and the other team members are a maintenance expert, flight surgeon,
judge advocate and any other needed specialists. The AIB begins its investigation by reviewing
the factual information from Part 1 of the SIB report and building on it to determine the cause
of the accident. The AIB re-interviews all witnesses and performs any additional testing
required. The AIB report includes the board president‟s opinion about what caused the
mishap, using a “clear and convincing evidence” standard. If there is insufficient evidence
to meet that high standard, the report will describe the factors believed to have contributed to the
accident. After the report is approved, if there are fatalities in the mishap, the families of the
deceased or any injured victims are briefed privately prior to public release. Note: For space
launch mishaps, AIBs are conducted in parallel with SIB‟s and not by “reviewing Part 1 of the
SIB‟s report“. This is done to ensure timely completion of space launch investigations and release
of information to the public and industry. For more information see AFI 51-503, Aerospace
Accident Investigations.
   7.16.1. The AIB report is releasable to the public. The report is completed and released in
   approximately 60 to 90 days. This timeline allows for technical review, coordination, and
   approval by the convening authority (MAJCOM/CC) and a briefing to family members, if
   applicable. If a press briefing is held, the AIB president serves as the Air Force
   spokesperson and is available to answer questions.
   7.16.2. Refer requests for accident information to the convening authority. The convening
   authority is the MAJCOM to which the weapon system is assigned. For ANG units the
   AIB is handled by the gaining command. Copies of the AIB report in its entirety can be
   obtained from the, Air Force Safety Center.
   7.16.3. Coordinate with MAJCOM/PA for local release (community in which the weapon
   system and/or personnel were assigned) of the AIB report‟s Executive Summary.

Section 7E—Disturbances and Crises

7.17. On-Base Disturbances. Disturbances, such as protests and marches, due to social,
political, or economic unrest, can occur on any Air Force installation. Public Affairs must
ensure their actions do not aggravate the existing situation. Public Affairs also must ensure all
actions are in close coordination with security forces activities. In overseas areas, ensure PA
activities during on-base disturbances conform to policies and directives established by the
combatant or specified commander and the country team.
   7.17.1. Release Authority. The local commander is the release authority. Higher
   headquarters may issue Public Affairs guidance. See Chapter 6, Media Operations, for
   media guidance. See Figure 7.4 for sample On-base Disturbance news release.
   7.17.2. Commander‟s Responsibilities.
       7.17.2.1. Adequately staff the PA office to provide required support during a
       disturbance, including authorized augmentation, where needed, to assist PA personnel.
158                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


      7.17.2.2. Meet with internal and external media when needed.
      7.17.2.3. Draft a message for the Straight Talk Center‟s telephone answering machine, e-
      mail and Web site.
      7.17.2.4. Conduct on-base town hall meetings or other open forums to quiet fears of
      non-participants and to help stabilize the situation.
   7.17.3. Public Affairs Responsibilities.
      7.17.3.1. Situation Report (SITREP). Send SITREP to MAJCOM/PA as warranted.
      Continue reporting during emergency conditions using priority precedence. Continue
      reporting during MINIMIZE. SITREP includes:
          7.17.3.1.1. Base facilities involved and how affected.
          7.17.3.1.2. Number of military personnel involved, both as participants in the
          disturbance, and as members of the control force or in support of the control forces.
          7.17.3.1.3. Number of PA augmentation forces requested or in place.
          7.17.3.1.4. Assessment of impact on-base personnel, including information about
          previous similar incidents.
          7.17.3.1.5. PA actions already taken and known or anticipated media interest.
      7.17.3.2. Deploy to Disturbance Area. Public Affairs will deploy with the on-scene
      response force to provide liaison between the disturbance area and the PA office.
      7.17.3.3. Activate, operate and update the Straight Talk line, e-mail and Web page.
      7.17.3.4. Media Actions.
          7.17.3.4.1. Activate and operate Media Operations Center.
          7.17.3.4.2. Respond to local media. Release information about the crisis as soon as it
          is available.
          7.17.3.4.3. Initial News Release. The initial news release must include the nature
          and background of the disturbance, numbers of personnel involved, damage or
          injury estimates, command actions, and a statement that the cause is being
          investigated.
          7.17.3.4.4. Escort Media.
              7.17.3.4.4.1. Before taking media representatives to the disturbance area, brief
              them on the current situation, base organizations involved, and any possible risks
              of personal harm.
              7.17.3.4.4.2. Issue a media badge. Coordinate with the security forces to ensure
              they recognize the badge. Note that media representatives are not allowed beyond
              the disturbance cordon perimeter, if established, or the edge of the disturbance.
      7.17.3.5. After-Action Report. Provide an after-action report to MAJCOM within seven
      days after the end of the disturbance. Report should contain a chronology of PA actions,
      problems encountered, community relations aspects, and lessons learned.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           159


7.18. Crisis 1ncidents. A crisis incident is characterized by violence and the intended
purpose. Crises may include, but are not limited to, the use or threatened use of automobile,
luggage or parcel explosives; land mines; fire bombs; poisons; environmental terrorism; ambush
killings and assassinations; taking of hostages; kidnapping; hijacking; theft of weapons; armed
robbery; mass demonstrations; sabotage; and a multitude of other forms of violence. Public
Affairs should follow the same procedures established for on-base disturbances.
   7.18.1. Crisis Management Forces. There must be no discussion of tactics, unit or personnel
   identification, locations, or equipment of these forces. For this reason, it is a DOD policy to
   disapprove media requests for interviews, videotaping, and coverage of training for crisis
   response forces. Beyond confirming that: “DOD has trained forces and equipment to cope
   with crisis situations,” there will be no further comment unless specifically authorized by
   OASD/PA after coordination with other government agencies. Refer queries beyond the
   scope of these responses to SAF/PA for coordination.
   7.18.2. Crisis Statements. During crisis incidents, it is essential U.S. Government
   representatives in Washington, D.C., U.S. Embassies and Combatant Commands overseas
   (as appropriate) and the Air Force on-scene spokespersons speak with one voice. For
   proposed responses to media queries, prior coordination is mandatory with relevant local or
   foreign authorities and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) (through SAF/PA to OASD/PA).
   Overseas, host governments have primary responsibility for managing crisis incidents that
   involve U.S. citizens or property, including possible attacks on U.S. Government
   organizations.
   7.18.3. Interviews. Refer interview requests to SAF/PA. Discourage live broadcasts that
   could reveal tactics, eliminate the element of surprise, or endanger lives.
7.19. Chemical or Biological Material. If an accident involves chemical or biological
material, release information according to AFI 10-2501, Full Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR)
Planning and Operations. The release must also comply with more specific instructions given in
movement and operations plans or orders, and DOD or overseas combatant command policies
that apply.
7.20. Terrorism. Because terrorists seek media recognition, media information management
must be in the best interest of the hostage and the situation. Public Affairs screens information
disseminated to the media to ensure operational security and force protection and provides
advice and counsel to those in charge. In general, statements may include U.S. policy that
terrorist acts are criminal, that the U.S. Government will make no concessions to terrorists, that
ransom will not be paid, and that nations fostering terrorism will be identified and isolated. In
response to a possible or real terrorist threat, the Public Affairs representative may acknowledge,
if appropriate, that increased security measures have been taken (without going into specific
detail). PA may also confirm the obvious. Requests for coverage of counter terrorism forces
will not be approved. In overseas areas, coordinate announcements with U.S. Embassy and
combatant command Public Affairs. Queries or requests for information or photography
beyond the above guidance must be referred to OASD/PA.
7.21. Near Mid-Air Collision. In case of a near mid-air collision that is of more than local
Public Affairs significance, advise higher headquarters of the details and the PA situation.
Include any actual or proposed responses to queries. MAJCOMs and FOAs must decide
  160                                                AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


  whether SAF/PA should be advised. Responses to news media queries at any level should be
  coordinated with the appropriate FAA office.

  Section 7F—Nuclear Weapons

  7.22. Policy for Information Releases After Nuclear Accidents and Incidents. D O D
  p o l i c y i s t o establish efficient and effective procedures for release of information to the public
  in the event of nuclear accidents or incidents. However, procedures must be consistent with the
  policy of neither confirming nor denying the presence or absence of nuclear weapons at any
  specific location.
  7.23. U.S. Initial Public Affairs Responsibility. In the United States and its territories and
  possessions, OASD/PA retains initial Public Affairs responsibility for nuclear weapon accidents
  and significant incidents. In overseas areas, combatant commanders, in coordination with
  OASD/PA, have this responsibility, with the exception of losses, thefts, or seizures.
  7.24. Neither Confirm Nor Deny (NCND). The presence of nuclear weapons or radioactive
  nuclear weapon components at any specified location must not be confirmed or denied, except
  for the following exemptions.
       7.24.1. Exception for Public Safety. In the interest of public safety in the United States and
       its territories and possessions, confirmation of nuclear weapons or radioactive nuclear
       weapon components may be made by any OSC. The deputy director of operations,
       National Military Command Center, also may invoke this exception to policy before the
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                              161


   OSC arrives, based on available information and coordination with the Air Force Chief of
   Staff, or designee. Notify public authorities in a timely, candid manner to enable them to take
   public safety actions. Notification is required if the public is or may be in danger of radiation
   exposure or any other danger posed by the nuclear weapon or radioactive nuclear weapon
   component. Make confirmation promptly when protective action or evacuation of civilians
   may be required. These actions may include releasing statements to news media to expedite
   public safety procedures. Advise SAF/PA and OASD/PA as soon as practicable when
   confirmation is made directly by the OSC or Deputy Director of Operations, National
   Military Command Center.
   7.24.2. Exception To Prevent Public Alarm. To reduce or prevent widespread public
   alarm in the United States and its territories and possessions, the OSC may issue an official
   statement of reassurance to the public that confirms or denies the presence of nuclear
   weapons or radioactive nuclear weapon components. Before the OSC arrives, the Deputy
   Director of Operations, NMCC, may invoke this exception to policy with available
   information and in coordination with the Air Force Chief of Staff, or designee. An official
   confirmation should be accompanied by appropriate assurances, such as that the chance of
   injury from high explosive detonation or potential exposure to radiation is highly unlikely.
   The confirmation also may state that use of explosive ordnance disposal teams and
   evacuation of military personnel is only a protective measure to limit the number of personnel
   at the accident site. A denial should characterize the accident or incident as a non-nuclear
   event. Notify SAF/PA and OASD/PA in advance if practical, or as soon as practicable
   thereafter if this exception to policy is initiated to enable OASD/PA and SAF/PA to continue
   initial Public Affairs responsibilities and ensure release of timely, accurate information at the
   national level.
   7.24.3. Overseas. In overseas areas other than United States territories and possessions,
   combatant commanders, with concurrence of the host government through the Chief of the
   U.S. Mission, may officially confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons or radioactive
   nuclear weapon components at the scene of an accident or significant incident in the interest
   of public safety or to reduce public alarm. Advise SAF/PA and OASD/PA, in advance if
   practical, if exception to policy is necessary. Inform civil authorities through the Chief of
   the U.S. Mission of an accident or significant incident involving nuclear weapons or
   radioactive nuclear weapon components in countries where international agreements
   require this information. Should a nuclear mishap occur in a country that requires public
   announcement either for public safety or to ease public alarm where Public Affairs
   coordination procedures are not established, the combatant commander or designee
   coordinates the announcement with the host government through the Chief of the U.S.
   Mission.
7.25. Release of Information. Information about any nuclear accident that does not cause a
public hazard or undue public alarm must not be released without OASD/PA approval. In event
of losses, seizures, or thefts of nuclear weapons, materials, or components by terrorists or other
dissident groups, or in the case of seizures of nuclear storage sites or any site or location having a
nuclear weapon or nuclear weapon system, release of information must be approved in advance
and handled by OASD/PA. However, this does not apply in overseas areas where governmental
agreements exist for the release of this information. Terrorist activities on or near an Air Force
162                                             AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


installation are considered a special case of civil disturbance rather than an accident. For general
policies on release of information, see Chapter 6, Media Operations.
   7.25.1. Release Texts and Requests. Aside from exceptions cited above, units involved in
   nuclear accidents or incidents must send proposed release texts and requests for releasing
   authority through channels to SAF/PA for coordination with OASD/PA. Telephone
   notifications are followed as soon as possible by an immediate precedence message, from the
   installation involved, to USAF WASHINGTON DC//PAM//; with ASD WASHINGTON
   DC//PO:PA//; and the installation‟s higher headquarters as information addressees.
   7.25.2. Procedures for Release After Nuclear Accidents and Incidents. Within the United
   States and its territories and possessions, the responsible commander must:
       7.25.2.1. Require the on-scene Public Affairs officer to contact SAF/PA by the most
       expeditious means. Phone numbers are DSN 225-0640 or commercial (703) 695-
       0640. During non-duty hours, contact the Air Force Operations Center, DSN 227-
       6103 or commercial (703) 697-6103, and ask for the SAF/PA duty officer.
       7.25.2.2. If action has not been taken by Federal Emergency Management Agency
       (FEMA) or the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a joint information center
       (JIC), immediately establish one near the accident site. Make sure all public
       information is coordinated at the JIC before release.
       7.25.2.3. Direct the release of basic accident or incident information without reference to
       nuclear material; see Figure 7.5, Nuclear Accident or Incident (No Danger to the Public;
       Confirms Hazardous Material to Reduce Public Alarm) Sample News Release.
       7.25.2.4. If needed, direct the preparation of a proposed follow-up release that is more
       specific to the situation that involves nuclear weapons, components, or radioactive
       materials and any conventional high explosives. See Figure 7.7, Announcement To
       Notify Local and State officials of a Nuclear Accident or Incident (When Public is
       Possibly in Danger; Neither Confirms nor Denies) Expanded Sample News Release. If
       the mishap causes a public hazard or undue public alarm, the responsible OSC issues the
       release on his or her own authority. If there is no public hazard or alarm, OASD/PA
       approval is required for confirmation or denial of the presence of nuclear material.
       7.25.2.5. Notify higher headquarters and obtain OASD/PA approval of the proposed
       follow-on release. Both telephonic and message notifications are required.
       7.25.2.6. Coordinate all further releases and proposed responses to queries that go
       beyond the scope of previously approved releases with appropriate members of the
       joint information center (JIC) or through channels to OASD/PA if the JIC has not been
       formed.
           7.25.2.6.1. Community Emergency Action Team (CEAT). When key local officials
           and civilian and state officials are informed of an accident or significant incident
           where radiation and other hazards may exist, direct a Community Emergency Action
           Team (CEAT) be formed by the JIC. The CEAT may include Public Affairs,
           medical, legal, security, communication, administrative, logistics, and other
           appropriate personnel. As these resources become available, they function under
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                        163


         the direction of the OSC, and are physically located in the JIC to facilitate
         coordination.
         7.25.2.6.2. Coordinate CEAT activities through the senior federal official (SFO)
         and with other agency PA activities to ensure a unified approach to working with
         the community. For military nuclear reactor or radiological accidents, state and local
         officials may be informed by FEMA in the United States and its territories and
         possessions.
     7.25.2.7. Acknowledge the presence of nuclear weapons, components or radioactive
     materials, as soon as possible, if the accident or incident causes a public hazard or undue
     public alarm. See Figure 7.9, Release To Notify the General Public About Nuclear
     Accident or Incident (When Public is Possibly in Danger).
     7.25.2.8. Avoid talking about nuclear weapons or materials, beyond the scope of the
     above guidance, unless authorized by OASD/PA.
     7.25.2.9. Ensure the OSC or designee establishes communication with OASD/PA
     immediately if an accident or incident requires implementing public safety measures.
     Direct communication between the OSC and OASD/PA ensures appropriate
     coordination of PA policy matters and provides timely, accurate information for public
     release at the national level until the Air Force service response force (SRF) takes
     responsibility for Public Affairs at the scene. Air Force Space Command has a
     response task force for Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) accidents within
     CONUS; Air Combat Command is the lead for nuclear weapons accident response for all
     CONUS non-ICBM nuclear weapons accidents.
  7.25.3. Nuclear Accident Planning. PAs for MAJCOMs possessing, storing, or transporting
  nuclear weapons, or supporting nuclear-capable units, will prepare sample PA annexes that
  can be tailored by unit Public Affairs officers. MAJCOMs and FOAs must guide
  subordinate units, describing what additional supplements or annexes are needed in support
  of accident or incident plans.
     7.25.3.1. Briefing Requirement.     DOD Directive 5230.16, Nuclear Accident and
     Incident Public Affairs (PA) Guidance, requires that certain military and civilian people
     be briefed to help them understand Air Force procedures for handling nuclear accidents
     or incidents. However, since there is usually intense local public interest in any Air
     Force aircraft accident, expand this briefing to cover aircraft accident procedures in
     general.
         7.25.3.1.1. Off-Base Briefings. The DOD directive requires commanders and Public
         Affairs officers to brief military and civil IAW enforcement, disaster response,
         nuclear weapons security force, intelligence and operations officials at least once a
         year. Areas discussed should include security, base plans, policies and IAWs. While
         face-to-face meetings and briefings are preferred, Public Affairs officers have the
         option, if conditions warrant, to provide the required information through by-name
         letters, videotapes, or handouts. The sensitive nature of nuclear accidents and
         incidents requires Public Affairs, disaster preparedness, and security police officials
         to conduct active Public Affairs and education programs with their civilian
164                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


         community counterparts; see DOD Directive 5230.16. Through annual briefings and
         meetings, installation officials must provide information for these civilians to ensure:
             7.25.3.1.1.1. Their understanding of nuclear safety and Air Force procedures used
             to eliminate hazards, in case of an accident that involves nuclear weapons or
             material, to include the establishment of NDAs. These meetings will not
             confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons or materials at the installation,
             and attendance by news media representatives is not recommended.
             7.25.3.1.1.2. The cooperation of civil officials and news media in making sure
             that any nuclear information given to the public is accurate, timely, and as
             complete as security allows.
             7.25.3.1.1.3. The preparation of joint plans and procedures to complement
             installation or unit plans for releasing information in nuclear accidents and
             incidents.
         7.25.3.1.2. On-Base Briefings. Public Affairs officers are responsible for briefing
         base disaster response and support agencies at least annually. The manner of
         presentation (e.g., in person, videotape, or a combination of both) should be
         determined by local needs, resources, and availability of personnel to be briefed. At
         intervals not to exceed 15 months, a PA person must brief:
             7.25.3.1.2.1. At all levels, unit security forces, AFOSI agents, firefighters,
             explosive ordnance disposal, operations, legal, medical, disaster preparedness,
             and any other Air Force people who respond to accidents. The briefing should
             include any intermediate commander‟s special PA instructions.
             7.25.3.1.2.2. Outside the United States and its territories, U.S. Defense Attaché
             officers and U.S. Embassy officials.
             7.25.3.1.2.3. At intermediate, MAJCOM, and FOA levels, give this briefing (at
             the same interval) to staff members who are eligible to serve on accident
             investigation boards and to those who would advise or monitor the activities of
             installation-level people who respond to accidents.          (Note:    Overseas,
             MAJCOM and FOA commanders will decide the relevance of informing local
             news media and civil authorities about the terms of this instruction and whether
             a waiver is needed. When the requirement to brief the media is waived for an
             installation, the MAJCOM PA office must keep a copy of that waiver and
             justification for as long as the waiver applies.)
      7.25.3.2. Conduct tests of PA procedures with other nuclear accident tests and training.
      7.25.3.3. Overseas. Overseas, the responsible U.S. Air Force commander must:
         7.25.3.3.1. Develop PA planning guidance that supplements combatant command
         plans for dealing with nuclear weapon provisions and procedures to inform State
         Department Public Affairs, Chief of U.S. Mission, and host government of
         emergency news releases and use of host government‟s public release capabilities.
         7.25.3.3.2. Establish contingency procedures, announcements, and methods of
         release developed with the Chief of U.S. Mission.
  AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                             165


             7.25.3.3.3. Specify provisions for clearing contingency announcements and
             methods of release with host government when required by international
             agreement and accomplished through the Chief of the U.S. Mission.
             7.25.3.3.4. Following combatant command guidelines, develop procedures to
             acknowledge presence of nuclear weapons, components, or radioactive materials as
             soon as possible if the accident or incident causes a public hazard or undue public
             alarm. Unless the combatant command has alternate procedures, use the sample
             contingency releases in this chapter as guides. Initial and follow-up releases must be
             coordinated with the Chief of U.S. Mission and with the combatant commander.
             When an accident or incident occurs, coordinate news release through channels
             and notify OASD/PA by telephone, message, or facsimile as soon as practicable.
             7.25.3.3.5. OASD/PA does not require advance coordination if the news releases
             are in response to mishaps resulting in public hazard or undue public alarm.
             7.25.3.3.6. Constitute a CEAT, which must coordinate its activities through the
             combatant commander, Chief of U.S. Mission, and host government authorities.
             For military nuclear reactor or radiological accidents, overseas areas-host
             government authorities may be informed through the combatant commander and
             Chief of U.S. Mission. Conduct tests of PA procedures with other nuclear accident
             tests and training.

(BASE NAME) AIR FORCE BASE, (State) (MAJCOM) -- (An, A) (aircraft, train, truck, other
transport)
accident occurred (location) at (time) today.
  AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                            169


      The accident involved a nuclear weapon that contains conventional high explosives and
radioactive material. There is no danger of a nuclear detonation.

      The public is warned to stay out of the area (or name the area), which is under surveillance
by guards, because the conventional high explosives in the weapon (have detonated, are burning,
may detonate). Again, there is no danger of nuclear detonation, but there is danger from the
conventional high explosives in the weapon.

An experienced Federal response team has been ordered to the scene of the accident.

       The most immediate danger in an accident of this kind is the effect of the blast caused by
detonation of the conventional high explosives in the weapon. Local scattering of nuclear material
in the form of finely divided dust may have resulted near the accident side and downwind from the
(explosion, fire). This poses little risk to health unless taken into the body by breathing or
swallowing, and it is considered unlikely that any person would inhale or swallow an amount that
would cause illness.

(Title)


(BASE NAME) AIR FORCE BASE, (State) (MAJCOM) -- As a precaution and until further
evaluations are made, anyone within a (to be filled in by the OSC or deputy director of
operations) radius of the accident site, particularly downwind from this site (specify boundary
where possible), is encouraged to remain indoors.
(NOTE: If appropriate, include the following)

       The following precautionary measures are recommended to minimize risk to the public. The
most appropriate initial action is to remain calm and inside homes or office buildings. Turn off
fans, air conditioners, and forced air heating units. Drink and eat only canned or packaged foods
 170                                               AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


that have been inside.

       Trained monitoring teams wearing special protective clothing will be moving through the
area to determine the extent of any possible contamination. Dress of these teams should not be
interpreted as indicating any special risk to those indoors.

       If you are outside, proceed to the nearest permanent structure. If you must go outside for
critical or lifesaving activities, cover your nose and mouth and avoid stirring up and breathing dust.
Remember that your movement outside could cause yourself greater exposure and possibly spread
contamination to those already supervised and protected.

ACCIDENT/2/2/2



(If uranium is involved add:)

       One of the materials involved is uranium. Contamination by uranium fragments or small
particles dispersed by (conventional chemical) explosions or burning of a weapon is primarily a
chemical health hazard (heavy metal poisoning similar to the lead poisoning associated with some
paints), not a radiological hazard.

      The public is asked to stay out of the area, until a monitoring team (if true), now en route to
the site, can survey the ground and determine the exact area affected by the accident. As a result of
the (explosion, fire), any fragments found near the scene may be contaminated and should be left
in place. If fragments have been picked up, avoid further handling and notify (authorities) for
proper retrieval and disposition.

       Continuing announcements will be made as more information is known. It is expected that
these immediate precautionary actions will be required for the next 4 to 6 hours (if true).
A United States (military service) team from (installation) is (en route to, has arrived at) the scene
of the accident.

       We have no details yet on civilian or military casualties (or give number only of civilian
and military casualties) or property damage. The (type carrier) was en route from (facility) to
(facility).

A board of officers has been appointed to investigate the (accident, incident).

                                          Chapter 8

                                COMMUNITY RELATIONS

Section 8A—Purpose and Objectives

8.1. Purpose of Community Relations. Active community relations programs enable
commanders to enhance morale, public trust, and support. Air Force professionals involved in
the communities where they live become front-line ambassadors for the Air Force. Through
active programs, the Air Force demonstrates it is a community partner and a responsible steward
of resources.
8.2. Objectives of the Community Relations Program.
      8.2.1. Increase public awareness and understanding of the armed forces and the mission,
      policies, and programs of the Air Force.
   8.2.2. Support Air Force recruiting by inspiring patriotism and encouraging young men and
   women to serve in the military.
      8.2.3. Maintain a reputation as a good neighbor, as well as a respected professional
      organization charged with part of the responsibility for national security.

Section 8B—Program Approval and Participation. (Note: Effective 23 February 1998,
OASD/PA delegated approval authority and responsibilities for armed forces aerial
demonstrations to the military services. Aerial demonstrations include performances by the
USAF Thunderbirds, flyovers, tactical demonstrations, and static displays. Effective 10 August
1998, Acting Secretary of the Air Force delegated action, responsibility and approval authority
to SAF/PA for Air Force aerial demonstrations. The delegation included approval authority for
Exceptions to Policy and required AF/XO coordination and concurrence for the Exceptions.)

8.3. Approval for Programs. Except as noted in this instruction, MAJCOMs and the
National Guard have the authority to approve the use of community relations resources. They
may, in turn, grant approval authority to subordinate commanders who manage resources.
Proposals for community relations programs exceeding local support capability or the scope
of local Public Affairs responsibility must be referred through channels to a designated
MAJCOM or next level higher headquarters with a description of the anticipated scope of the
program, comments concerning expected civilian reaction, recommendations, and predicted
benefits.
   8.3.1. SAF/PA and OASD/PA approve:
         8.3.1.1. National Capital Region (NCR). All Air Force support of community relations
         programs in the NCR, except speaking engagements to non-foreign groups. The NCR
         includes the District of Columbia; Montgomery and Prince George‟s counties in
         Maryland; Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William counties in Virginia; and
         the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, and Falls Church in Virginia.
         8.3.1.2. National and international programs, including conventions and meetings.
         Except those in overseas areas under combatant or specified commanders.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                        173


     8.3.1.3. Programs requiring liaison between DOD and Washington, D.C., offices of
     national non-government organizations and groups. Except Air Force special interest
     groups such as the Air Force Association (AFA) and the Air Force Sergeants Association
     (AFSA).
     8.3.1.4. Programs providing information or other support to national organizations,
     including business and industry groups.
     8.3.1.5. Programs outside the United States not within a combatant command‟s area of
     responsibility.
     8.3.1.6. Aircraft and related equipment and personnel participation in exception-to-
     policy events or those involving more than one Service.
     8.3.1.7. Sports. Preseason, post-season, or known programmed national sports and
     professional athletic events within the United States.
     8.3.1.8. Events of professional, technical, or scientific interest to the Air Force when
     participation will result in additional cost to the government. The request must
     include an estimate of the expense.
     8.3.1.9. Programs or events requiring exceptions to DOD policy, which must be
     specifically justified.
  8.3.2. SAF/PA approval:
     8.3.2.1. National Civic Outreach Tour. A completed tour plan template to include
     justification must be forwarded to SAF/PANC for review (See Figure 8.1).
     8.3.2.2. Aircraft, related equipment, support personnel requests for participation in
     exception-to-policy events.
     8.3.2.3. Invitations from a foreign host in the Washington, D.C. area.
     8.3.2.4. Public Affairs airlift involving foreign nationals to CONUS, in conjunction with
     SAF/IA.
  8.3.3. Local unit commanders are authorized to participate routinely in local events jointly
  planned and conducted by border communities of the United States, Mexico, and Canada.
  Favorable consideration for participation should be based on the significance of the event and
  defense interest. Consultation and approval is required from U.S. consular officials in the
  Mexican and Canadian communities involved.
  8.3.4. Within the United States, MAJCOMs coordinate community relations programs
  and public events with combatant and specified commands significantly affected. In the
  same manner, DOD requires combatant and specified commands to coordinate with HQ
  USAF and MAJCOMs on programs requiring Air Force support.
  8.3.5. The Secretary of Defense has made combatant commanders responsible for approving
  and participating in overseas public events. This authority may be delegated. While Air
  Force MAJCOMs overseas operate their programs to conform to this regulation, policy
  direction and guidance provided by combatant command headquarters takes precedence.
  Air Force MAJCOMs overseas must also advise SAF/PA when taking part in any public
174                                             AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   event that will significantly affect operations or require major administrative, financial, or
   logistical support.
8.4. Participation in Public Events. Participation by Air Force people and display of Air
Force equipment in public events furthers public understanding of the Air Force mission.
Within legal and policy limitations, commanders at all levels who plan or conduct a community
relations program must consider the interests of the Air Force and the community as a whole. The
Air Force and DOD belong to the American people. Common ownership dictates our resources
are committed to support events and activities of mutual interest and benefit. However, since
limitations of time and money make it impossible to grant all requests, public affairs will take all
appropriate requests into equal consideration and grant approval based on common factors that
are in the best interests of the Air Force and taxpayer.
8.5. Participation Guidelines.
   8.5.1. Training. Ensure there is no interference with normal training or operational
   activities, determine if it is economically feasible, and make sure appropriate resources are
   available.
   8.5.2. Facilities. Providing government facilities such as housing and messing at government
   expense to non-DOD civilians is a prohibited type of selective benefit or favor. However,
   these services may be granted for base visits if participants reimburse costs.
   8.5.3. Transportation. For base visits, transportation may be provided, without
   reimbursement, if it makes the visit easier to handle and is in the best interest of the Air
   Force.
   8.5.4. Endorsement of Groups. Allowing groups to provide entertainment on-base to military
   people, civilian employees, or family members does not constitute an endorsement.
   Promotion of the group‟s objectives through handouts, speeches, program content, or other
   forms of promotion connected with the entertainment (including the period before and after
   the entertainment) is prohibited. (Note: This prohibition does not apply to the publicity
   required to inform people of the event.) Commanders must make sure participation is in good
   taste, appropriate in scope and type, and in keeping with the dignity of the Air Force.
   Participation should be coordinated with other military Services and Air Force units if they
   are to be involved.
   8.5.5. Wear of Uniform. Active duty Air Force may appear in uniform at local
   community-wide, civic sponsored events only when the approving commander believes
   participation is appropriate and in good taste; the individuals volunteer for the assignment;
   there is no interference with military duties or operations; participation involves no
   additional cost to the government; and the event meets the basic participation criteria
   below. This applies to active duty, reserve and retired military. Ref: DODD1334.1, Wearing
   of the Uniform.
8.6. Participation Criteria. To ensure every planned event complies with public IAW and
DOD policy, at least one condition in each of the following participation criteria categories must
be met: Program, Sponsor, Support, and Site.
   8.6.1. Participation Criteria--Program.
       8.6.1.1. Approved:
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                             175


         8.6.1.1.1. Directed by Public IAW, executive order, or the Secretary of Defense.
         8.6.1.1.2. Official federal government or civil ceremonies or functions.
         8.6.1.1.3. Events or occasions of general interest or benefit to a local, regional, or
         national community that are open to the general public.
         8.6.1.1.4. In support of Air Force recruiting programs.
         8.6.1.1.5. Supporting DOD approved united, federated, or joint fundraising
         campaign.
         8.6.1.1.6. In support of fundraising campaigns for U.S. teams competing in the Pan
         American or Olympic games.
         8.6.1.1.7. Patriotic in nature for the celebration of an official local, state, regional, or
         national holiday.
         8.6.1.1.8. Fundraising. Air Force support of other local fundraising programs is
         authorized when the program is local in nature, of community-wide interest and
         benefit, and is supported or approved by the local united, federated, or joint
         campaign officials. The local MAJCOM commander decides if support is part of the
         responsible role of the Air Force in the local community. (Examples are volunteer
         fire department, rescue unit, and youth activity fund drives.) Support must be
         incidental in nature. Care must be given to ensure support does not give preferential
         treatment to a single event or cause, even if the charitable organization is included in
         the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC). That policy, which is government-wide,
         simply reflects the practical limitations on DOD to extend official support on an
         equal basis to every worthwhile cause.
     8.6.1.2. Disapproved.
         8.6.1.2.1. Intended, or which appear to endorse, selectively benefit, or favor, any
         private individual, special interest group, business, religious, ideological movement,
         commercial venture, political candidate, or organization.
         8.6.1.2.2. For the purpose of soliciting votes in a political election.
         8.6.1.2.3. Commercially sponsored and intended to increase sales and business traffic
         (such as a business/mall grand opening, motion picture promotion or beauty pageant).
         8.6.1.2.4. For fundraising events see paragraph 8.6.1.1.8
         8.6.1.2.5. In a situation where the real or apparent purpose is to stage controversy
         or public confrontation. This also includes fundraising appeals approved by the
         President or Chairman of the Office of Personnel Management or military service aid
         societies.
  8.6.2. Participation Criteria--Sponsor.
     8.6.2.1. Approved.
         8.6.2.1.1. Local, state, or federal governments.
         8.6.2.1.2. A veterans, military Service related, patriotic, or historical organization, or
         its auxiliary.

          8.6.2.1.3. A civic, service, youth, professional, educational, trade, or labor
          organization interested in supporting the Air Force.
          8.6.2.1.4. Organizations whose membership is based on sex or national origin, if the
          program is for the entire community and not to promote the organization‟s objectives.
          8.6.2.1.5. A commercial enterprise when Air Force support is patriotic in nature, is
          incidental to the primary program, and does not selectively benefit the commercial
          activity of the sponsor. The sponsor‟s role must be clearly civic in nature and not
          commercial.
          8.6.2.1.6. A public school, college or university; or nonpublic school, college, or
          university where the program is of community-wide interest and benefit. The
          program must be free, open to all, and broadly promoted. It must be clearly an
          educational, patriotic, or recruiting program.
          8.6.2.1.7. A religious group, if programs are of community-wide interest,
          nonsectarian, and broadly promoted.
          8.6.2.1.8. Air Force bands, performers, and other units may perform on television
          and radio programs. The programs must be on public service broadcasts and
          participation must not benefit or endorse any commercial enterprise. Bands,
          performers, and other Air Force units may appear on national or regional commercial
          programs only with approval of OASD/PA through SAF/PA. Requests must be made
          through channels at least 60 days in advance.
      8.6.2.2. Disapproved.
          8.6.2.2.1. Any organization that excludes anyone from its membership because of
          race, religion, color, national origin, or sex, unless the organization is based on sex
          or national origin and the program is for the entire community and not to promote the
          organization‟s objectives.
          8.6.2.2.2. A commercial enterprise, unless Air Force support is patriotic, incidental to
          the primary program, and does not selectively benefit the commercial activity,
          whose role must be clearly civic in nature.
          8.6.2.2.3. Any organization whose constitution, by-IAWs, membership
          qualifications, or ritual is not available to the general public. Examples are secret
          societies and many fraternal organizations.
          8.6.2.2.4. A sect, partisan political organization, or ideological movement.
   8.6.3. Participation Criteria--Support.
      8.6.3.1. Approved.
          8.6.3.1.1. Authorized by Public IAW, executive order, the Secretary of Defense,
          and those explained in paragraph 8.6.4
          8.6.3.1.2. That can be reasonably expected to bring credit to the individuals
          involved and to the Air Force, and are at no additional cost to the government.
          8.6.3.1.3. Where admission is charged, if the support is incidental to the primary
          event.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                        177


         8.6.3.1.4. Where admission is charged, but support includes Service Academy sports
         events, military aerial demonstration team performances approved in accordance
         with DOD policy, and Navy and USMC band concerts while on DOD tours.
     8.6.3.2. Disapproved.
         8.6.3.2.1. When support might interfere with customary or regular employment of
         civilians in their art, trade, or profession.
         8.6.3.2.2. Are, or could be considered, the primary or major attraction for which
         admission is charged, unless support includes service academy sports events,
         military aerial demo team performances approved in accordance with DOD policy,
         and Navy and USMC band concerts while on DOD tours.
         8.6.3.2.3. Uses Air Force resources, services, or facilities which are reasonably
         available from commercial sources and where such use would be in fact, or perceived
         as, unfair competition.
         8.6.3.2.4. Involves the use of active duty, Air Guard, Reserve, or ROTC personnel in
         uniform outside military bases as guards, parking lot attendants, runners, messengers,

         does not appear to selectively benefit any commercial business.
         8.6.4.1.6. In a building or facility used for religious purpose, when programs are of
         community-wide interest, nonsectarian, and broadly promoted.

178                                             AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


8.7. Funding Requirements. Basic Air Force policy is to keep costs of its participation to a
minimum. This can be done best by using local resources. Participation requiring additional cost
to the government should be avoided unless considered in the best interest of the Air Force.
Scheduled training or troop movements that are viewed by the public are considered incidental
to training and not a Public Affairs function. However, there are events that result in additional
cost when support is in the best interest of the Air Force. Payment for these costs is based on two
event categories: Primary Interest--all costs borne by the Air Force unit or units involved and
Mutual Interest--costs are shared by the Air Force and the sponsor. The following guidelines
apply.
   8.7.1. Primary Interest. Primary Interest events include those requiring SAF/PA and
   OASD/PA approval, and those that may be approved by the local unit commander. In either
   case, the participating unit incurs all costs.
       8.7.1.1. Events requiring SAF/PA approval include band appearances when
       appropriated funds are used; events in the national interest or of unique benefit to the
       United States; and professional, scientific, or technical events of interest to the Air
       Force. Send requests for approval (through channels) 60 days in advance to SAF/PA.
       8.7.1.2. Events for which the participating unit is authorized to bear all costs might
       include DOD requirements, Air Force or civic-sponsored public observances of the
       United States or a host country, other official ceremonies or functions, or speaking
       engagements.
       8.7.1.3. Static display of aircraft and aerial demonstrations are considered events of
       mutual interest to the Air Force, unless designated primary interest events through
       SAF/PA by OASD/PA (that is, sponsors must be willing to pay additional costs incurred
       such as travel, per diem, etc.). Units desiring to take part in an event for which they will
       bear the full cost of participation must send requests with full justification for an
       exception to policy through channels to SAF/PA. Unless otherwise noted, requests or
       taskings to units must be on a Mutual Interest basis.
   8.7.2. Mutual Interest. Events identified as Mutual Interest are carried out with the civilian
   sponsor.
       8.7.2.1. The participating unit is responsible for Air Force costs of participation unless
       advised otherwise by higher authority. Units must budget for these costs in annual
       financial plans. The unit‟s costs are those continuing costs that exist even if the Air
       Force did not participate. These include pay and allowances, and incidental expenses
       such as local transportation and telephone calls.
       8.7.2.2. The cost of opportune airlift or routine flights in military aircraft for
       transportation of people and exhibit materials is also an Air Force share of costs. This
       only applies to the support of other military Services whose participation in an event has
       been authorized.
           8.7.2.2.1. Civilian sponsor must reimburse the Air Force for additional costs,
           including but not limited to: travel cost of military personnel and equipment; per diem
           payable under federal joint travel regulations; cost of shipping exhibit materials
           when commercial means are used; any rental space, utilities, or custodial services;
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                            179


           and cost of shipping aviation fuel if it is not available at a military contract price at
           the required location.
       8.7.2.3. Also included are any additional services determined necessary by the
       participating units and agreed on by the civilian sponsor. MAJCOMs, may waive the per
       diem cost payment requirement and accept locally furnished meals and quarters, but
       only if they meet military standards. This waiver authority may not be delegated to a
       lower authority even if such items are accepted without prior approval.
       8.7.2.4. Sponsors must also provide local area ground transportation, exhibits, space,
       utilities, custodial services, or any other required services.

Section 8C—Use of Military Aircraft for Events

8.8. General Guidance. The Air Force takes part in events at military and civilian locations to
keep the public and military informed of U.S. preparedness, to demonstrate modern weapons
systems, to promote good community and international relations, to support Air Force recruiting
and retention efforts, and to render military honors. Flyovers of public events in support of
community relation activities must be flown as an addition to an approved training mission. Air
Force participation in any public event shall be in keeping with Department of Defense
Directive 5410.18, Public Affairs Community Relations Policy, and Department of Defense
Instruction 5410.19, Public Affairs Community Relations Policy Implementation. Authority to
approve most requests from organizations requesting off-base aviation support has been
delegated by the OASD/PA to the military services. Per delegation from the Secretary of the
Air Force, the approval authority for Air Force participation in such events is SAF/PA in
coordination with HQ USAF/XO. Safety is the primary consideration. All pertinent safety
regulations of the Department of Defense, Department of the Air Force and the Federal
Aviation Administration shall be strictly enforced. Air Force participation at events requires
approval for eligibility (SAF/PAN) and participation approval (HQ USAF/XOO). While the
public affairs community approves the appropriateness of an event for Air Force participation,
the operations community concurs on the operational issues impacting the feasibility and cost of
the participation.
   8.8.1. Public Affairs determines eligibility, IAW DoD and AF policy, for aviation-related
   events (aviation shows, aviation fairs, aviation expositions, airport dedications, events
   primarily designed to encourage the advancement of aviation, and civic events that
   contribute to the public knowledge of Armed Forces aviation equipment and capabilities),
   and non-aviation-related events (all sporting events and unique community-relations
   activities).
   8.8.2. Non-aviation-related events must follow exception-to-policy procedures. Exception-
   to-policy approvals are granted only when participation is in the best interest of the Air
   Force. The exception-to-policy request form should reach SAF/PAN 45 days in advance of
   the event date.
   8.8.3. Use of any aircraft or equipment undergoing testing in a research and development
   (R&D) program must be approved by HQ USAF/XO and SAF/AQ. Submit these requests,
   through channels, to HQ USAF/XOO (Info HQ USAF/XOOO) at least 60 days before the
   event date.
180                                            AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   8.8.4. All events scheduled for or that may attract national or international media coverage
   are coordinated with OASD(PA)/CRPL. Send requests, through channels, to SAF/PAN and
   SAF/PAM at least 45 days before the event date or as soon as the event is known.
8.9. On-Base Public Events. Military units sponsoring one or more aerial events on a military
installation when the event is open to the public will submit requests, through channels, to the
appropriate MAJCOM having operational control of the desired assets.
8.10. Use of Military Aircraft for Off-Base Public Events. Requests for off-base flyovers
will be considered only for aviation-oriented events (i.e., air shows, airport anniversaries or
dedications) or for patriotic observances held in conjunction with formal observances, open to
the public, on Armed Forces Day (third Saturday in May), Memorial Day (last Monday in
May), Independence Day (4 July), Prisoner Of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) Recognition
Day (third Friday in September), and Veterans Day (11 November) when held within seven days
of the holiday date. As part of the approval process, local wing PAs must ascertain that the
event is, in fact, in direct support of the patriotic holiday. MAJCOMs may approve eligibility
for aviation events and those in direct support of a patriotic holiday for bases under their
control. Exceptions-to-policy for events other than those listed above shall be considered by
SAF/ PAN on a case-by-case basis, after determining appropriateness and benefit of Air Force
participation. Note: Sporting events require SAF/PAN exception-to-policy approval regardless of
the date. For example, a professional or local baseball game on July 4th must be sent to
SAF/PAN for approval.
   8.10.1. When a request is received for use of military aircraft at a location in North America,
   provide the sponsor with a copy of DD Form 2535, Request for Military Aviation Support,
   and information on military assets available. Assist the sponsor in filling out the request and
   instruct the sponsor to forward the form to SAF/PAN within required time constraints.
   Note: Federal Aviation Administration coordination must be completed before forwarding
   the DD Form 2535 to SAF/PA.
   8.10.2. Overseas Requests. For overseas units, authority for aircraft participation at civilian
   locations is delegated to the appropriate combatant commander. If applicable, concurrence
   of MAJCOM with operational control of assets requested is required. Overseas requests for
   CONUS-based assets to specifically deploy in support of an air show or other public event
   (i.e., Paris Air Show or Farnborough Air Show) should be addressed to SAF/PAN and
   AF/XOOO at least 60 days before the event.
   8.10.3. Non-Aviation-Related Events. Requests for non-aviation-related event exceptions-
   to-policy should reach SAF/PAN at least 45 days before the event. Requests for flyovers and
   single-ship tactical demonstrations should reach SAF/PAN at least 45 days before the
   event. Completed requests received within 14 days of the event will not be considered.
   Non-aviation-related events taking place on the five patriotic holidays still require an
   exception-to-policy if the events are previously scheduled (i.e. sporting events that would
   take place in spite of the holiday). An aerial events message will be distributed annually to
   specify the types of exception-to-policy events that will be eligible for support by the Air
   Force and pre-determine the proper level of support.

AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         181


8.11. Thunderbirds. Demonstrations by the Thunderbirds are flown only over airports, large
bodies of water, or unpopulated areas. Requests for performances must reach SAF/PAN no
later than 1 August to be considered for the following calendar year‟s schedule.
   8.11.1. Performances on Air Force Bases. Aerial demonstrations at Air Force bases are
   requested by Public Affairs through the MAJCOM to SAF/PAN by 1 August. Requests for
   the Navy‟s Blue Angels and the Army‟s Golden Knights are submitted to the U.S. Navy and
   U.S. Army Public Affairs offices indicated on page 4 of DD Form 2535. Requests for the
   Canadian Snowbirds are submitted to the 431st Air Demonstration Squadron, PO Box
   5000, Moose Jaw, SK S6H 7Z8. For more information and a copy of the request form, visit
   the team‟s website: http://www.snowbirds.dnd.ca.
   8.11.2. Performances on Other-Than-Air-Force Military Installations. Requests for Air
   Force aircraft must be submitted to SAF/PAN for review and submission to the Thunderbirds
   by 1 August of the previous year. The individual or agency sponsoring the event must send
   a DD Form 2535 directly to SAF/PAN. Air Force Public Affairs offices may provide the
   sponsor with DD Form 2535, but should refrain from submitting the request for the sponsor
   to avoid any perception that the Air Force will approve the request. The Secretary of the
   Air Force is the approval authority for the Thunderbirds aerial demonstration team.
   8.11.3. Cancellations. An organization notified of a cancellation of an off-base performance
   or a unit canceling a performance by the Thunderbirds at its base must immediately send a
   message listing the date the performance was scheduled, place, reason for cancellation, and
   person canceling the performance (with phone number and affiliation, if possible, for a
   civilian site), through Public Affairs channels to its headquarters with the following as
   information or action addressees: SAF/PAN, HQ USAF/ XOO and ACC/PA/DO.
   8.11.4. All activities undertaken by the Thunderbirds that are likely to result in national
   media exposure (i.e. videos, orientation flights and television appearances) shall be
   reported to SAF/PAN and SAF/PAM simultaneously.
   8.11.5. All eligible events will be posted to the Air Force Aerial Events website:
   www.air- shows.pa.hq.af.mil.
8.12. Foreign Demonstration Teams. Performances by government-sponsored foreign
demonstration teams at Air Force installations can enhance international goodwill. Questions
regarding performances by foreign teams in the United States may be telephonically addressed
to SAF/PAN.
8.13. Parachute Demonstrations. Parachute demonstrations are restricted to appropriate
events over airports, open bodies of water, or areas of land where adequate crowd control can be
assured.
   8.13.1. Requests for off-base parachute demonstrations at locations other than those
   specified must receive approval as an exception-to-policy. Participation is usually limited to
   three days for any one event.
   8.13.2. Only one parachute team or club from each service may take part in the same public
   event.
   8.13.3. Participation by official parachute teams, parachute sports clubs, or qualified
   individuals in competitive parachute meets sanctioned by the United States Parachute
182                                              AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   Association (USPA) may be authorized provided such competitions are not with a public
   event such as a fair, exposition, or similar event. Under the above criteria, an insurance bond
   is not required for participants in USPA events.

Section 8E—Types of Aviation Support and Approval Levels. (See AFI 11-209, Air Force
Participation in Aerial Events, for additional guidance.

8.14. Static Displays.
   8.14.1. On-Base Public Event.
       8.14.1.1. Small Public Events. The host commander has approval authority for static
       displays for events like base tours as long as the aircraft is not a new weapon system, and
       is in the inventory.
       8.14.1.2. Large Public Events. MAJCOMs may approve on-base static displays for
       assigned operational resources not in conjunction with a retirement or change-of-
       command ceremony.
       8.14.1.3. Civilian Aircraft. MAJCOMs may approve static display of civilian aircraft
       on their own command bases. Civilian participation should be at no additional cost to
       the U.S. Government. See AFI 34-407, Air Force Commercial Sponsorship Program,
       and AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility, for guidance.
       8.14.1.4. Static displays do not require FAA approval.
       8.14.1.5. Static displays should have at least one qualified crewmember available to
       answer questions from spectators and to ensure security.
       8.14.1.6. Static displays used in conjunction with retirement/change-of-command
       ceremonies will consist only of aircraft assigned to the base where the ceremony is
       occurring. For complete guidance on retirements and changes of command, refer to AFI
       11-209, Air Force Aerial Events.
   8.14.2. Off-Base Public Events.
       8.14.2.1. Authorized only at airfields, heliports, and landing sites meeting the
       qualifications prescribed in AFI 13-218, Air Traffic System Evaluation Program, as
       supplemented by MAJCOMs. OSD may approve an exception to this policy if the
       proposed display area meets operational and safety requirements. If an exception-to-
       policy is required, submit requests, through channels, to HQ USAF/XOO (Info HQ
       USAF/XOOO and SAF/PAN) for OASD(PA) approval at least 60 days before the event.
       8.14.2.2. MAJCOMs may approve static displays of their assigned operational resources.
       8.14.2.3. Static displays should have at least one qualified crewmember available to
       answer questions from spectators and to ensure security.
       8.14.2.4. Static displays do not require FAA approval.
8.15. Flyovers. A flyover, whether on-base or off-base, is a straight and level flight, limited to
one pass, by no more than four military aircraft of the same general type (e.g., tactical, transport,
rotary wing) from the same military service over a predetermined point on the ground at a
specific time and not involving aerobatics or demonstrations. A flyover of more than four
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                          183


aircraft, or of multiple types of aircraft, or of aircraft representing more than one military
service or nation, regardless of horizontal/timing separation of flying elements, constitutes an
aerial review. Flyovers at memorial or funeral services in honor of rated and/or designated active
duty aviation personnel are not community relations activities. In those cases, Mortuary
Affairs and AF/XOO shall determine applicability of a flyover.
   8.15.1. General Approval Process. Secretary of the Air Force, Public Affairs (SAF/PAN) is
   responsible for and tasked with ensuring that airshows, flyovers, Air Force parachute team
   (AFPT) demonstrations, static displays, and non-aviation events that desire Air Force
   aviation participation, are appropriate events for Air Force support. Unified combatant
   commanders, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, and OSD officials also have roles in
   specific cases, to deem an event eligible or ineligible for military participation. Event
   sponsors are required to accomplish a DD Form 2535 to request approval. Once the
   completed DD Form 2535 is reviewed and the event is determined eligible for Air Force
   participation, the event is published on the Public Affairs aviation web site (www.air-
   shows.pa.hq.af.mil). The site may or may not include MAJCOM approved events.
   Complete requests procedures and additional information can be obtained from the Air
   Force Aviation Support web site (www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil).
   8.15.2. Units wishing to volunteer to support an event must indicate their intent on the
   website or via telephone to SAF/PAN. Sponsors of events may contact a unit to solicit
   participation in their particular event. Units should not rely on the sponsor to notify
   SAF/PAN.
   8.15.3. Notification procedures. MAJCOMs are required to notify SAF/PAN and HQ
   USAF/XOOO in writing of all locally approved events at least 10 days before the event
   date. Notification should include at a minimum, date of event, name and location, unit
   participating, type of aircraft and point of contact.
   8.15.4. On-Base Military Event. MAJCOMs are authorized to approve flyovers by their
   assigned operational assets (excluding retirement-or-change of command ceremonies) on
   their own bases or bases requested by other MAJCOMs. For notification requirements, refer
   to para. 8.15.2
       8.15.4.1. Unit Change-of-Aircraft Ceremony or Unit Flag-Retirement Ceremony.
       Aerial events honoring a Unit Flag-Retirement Ceremony or a Unit Change-of-
       Aircraft Ceremony are not authorized at off-base locations. See AFI 11-209 for specific
       guidance.
       8.15.4.2. National Guard Training Academy. The National Guard Academy of Military
       Science, McGhee Tyson ANGB, Tenn. is considered an on base location for the purpose
       of graduation flyovers and other approved events.
   8.15.5. U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA). All definitions and policies regarding flyovers
   and aerial reviews apply to the USAFA. Examples of approved Academy events include
   graduation ceremonies, football games, parades and other events with a patriotic/military
   theme. The commandant requests appropriate Air Force participation, which is limited to
   flyovers, parachute demonstrations and glider demonstrations. MAJCOM commanders may
   approve these flyovers, either as proffered support or in response to requests from USAFA.
184                                          AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


      8.15.5.1. USAFA officials must notify each participating MAJCOM when flyovers are
      scheduled by more than one MAJCOM on the same day. When more than one flyover
      event is scheduled within any three-hour time frame, this notification will include as a
      minimum: flyover timing, number of aircraft in each flight, direction of flight, altitude,
      USAFA point of contact, and other information deemed necessary for safety of flight.
      When separate flyovers are more than three hours apart, other MAJCOMs need not be
      notified.
      8.15.5.2. For each event, the flyover will consist of not more than four aircraft of the
      same type making one pass.
      8.15.5.3. USAFA officials will notify HQ USAF/XOOO, SAF/PAN and SAF/PAM
      10 days before the event date of any flyover that may have national media coverage.
  8.15.6. Off-Base Public Event. Event-eligibility determination is either at SAF/PAN or
  MAJCOM levels. Air Force evaluation of aviation support for off-base events is based on the
  theme and purpose of the event, the sponsoring organization, anticipated audience, assets
  requested, and the benefits of participation to the Air Force.
      8.15.6.1. Single flyovers. MAJCOMs are authorized to approve flyovers of no more
      than four aircraft of the same type, making one pass only, in support of: aviation-related
      events, or Armed Forces Day (3rd Saturday in May), Memorial Day (last Monday in
      May), Independence Day (July 4), POW/MIA Recognition Day (3rd Friday in
      September), and Veterans Day (November 11). Flyovers must occur within seven days
      before or after the national day of observance and must directly support the holiday
      commemoration. Sporting events that fall within the seven-day window require
      SAF/PAN approval. For notification requirements, refer to para. 8.15.2.
          8.15.6.1.1. Multiple passes. Multiple passes by the same formation at any off-base
          event are not authorized. Send request for waiver to HQ USAF/XOOO. Submit these
          requests, through MAJCOM leadership, to HQ USAF/XOOO (Info SAF/PAN) at
          least 15 days before the event date.
      8.15.6.2. SAF/PAN coordinates all eligible events with HQ USAF/XOO to determine
      the extent of operational participation authorized, which is outlined in the annual aerial
      events message.
   8.15.7. Requests for missing-man formation. The missing-man formation is authorized for
   use at ceremonies commemorating Memorial Day, POW/MIA Recognition Day, Veterans
   Day and at other suitable events when the theme is solemn in nature and when the event is
   not held in conjunction with another event (e.g. sporting events or air shows). The missing-
   man formation shall not be flown at CONUS public events without the approval of HQ
   USAF/XOO (Info SAF/PAN).
      8.15.7.1. For OCONUS commands, U.S. military support for Memorial Day events at
      U.S. military cemeteries overseas is a key community relations activity. All wings are
      encouraged to support these requests to the maximum extent possible.
          8.15.7.1.1. While determination of event eligibility rests with the unified
          commander, approval for missing-man flyovers at Memorial Day events at U.S.
          cemeteries overseas is delegated to the supporting MAJCOM.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                            185


8.16. Aerial Review. A flyover of more than four aircraft, or of multiple types of aircraft, or
of aircraft representing more than one military Service or Nation, regardless of
horizontal/timing separation of flying elements, constitutes an aerial review. A single element
involving four or less aircraft of different airframes but of the same general type (e.g. two F-16s
and two F-15s) is not considered an aerial review. However, this formation should be
undertaken only with applicable consideration given to safety, compatible flying characteristics,
and the overall theme of the event that is being supported. Air show flights are exempt.
   8.16.1. Aerial reviews are reserved only for the most meaningful occasions and shall not be
   scheduled or performed at CONUS events without initial review and approval by
   SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/ XOO (Combatant Command initial review and approval for
   OCONUS events), and with final approval granted by OASD(PA). Submit these requests,
   through MAJCOM leadership, to SAF/PAN (Info HQ USAF/XOOO) 45 days before the
   event date.
   8.16.2. Multi-Service or multi-nation aerial reviews on or off-base may require additional
   approval. Refer to 11-209 for specific guidance. Submit these requests, through MAJCOM
   leadership, to SAF/ PAN (Info HQ USAF/XOOO) at least 45 days before the event date.
   8.16.3. The unit making the initial request will submit these requests, through channels, to
   SAF/PAN (Info HQ USAF/XOOO) at least 45 days before the event date.
   8.16.4. As distinctly diverse assets, the combination of a parachute jump and flyover, or a
   flyover and aircraft demonstration (not to exceed a total of four elements) will not be
   performed at public events without approval by SAF/PAN and AF/XOO. Use of such
   aviation assets will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Approval will be based on the
   supportive justification as to the significance of the event, and the ability to provide such
   resources at no additional costs to the government.
8.17. Aircraft Demonstrations. Aerial demonstration is a generic phrase that includes
virtually every type of aerial participation in public or military events (except for aerial review
and flyover) to include: aerobatics, aircraft capabilities demonstrations, assault landing/takeoffs,
aircraft weapons or tactics demonstrations, MAJCOM Vintage Aircraft Programs, airdrop
demonstrations of personnel or equipment, and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR)
demonstrations. It is used inter-changeably with the phrase aircraft demonstration. MAJCOMs
may approve demonstrations by their assigned operational assets on their own command
bases. MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM requests for these aerial events are approvable by the
MAJCOM owning the requested assets. For notification requirements, refer to para. 8.15.2
   8.17.1. Activities such as mass parachute jumps (those involving more than one aircraft),
   aerial delivery (airdrop) of equipment, aircraft assault demonstrations, and tactical
   helicopter troop landings (those involving more than four aircraft, or involving more than
   one Military Service) under simulated tactical conditions shall not be performed at
   CONUS public events without initial review and approval by SAF/PAN and HQ
   USAF/XOO. Submit these requests, through MAJCOM PA, to SAF/ PAN (info HQ
   USAF/XOOO) 45 days before the event date.
8.18. Jump Platform.
   8.18.1. On-Base.
186                                             AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


         8.18.1.1. MAJCOMs may approve use of their assigned operational assets on their own
         command bases. For notification requirements, refer to para. 8.15.2
         8.18.1.2. MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM requests for a jump platform are approved by the
         MAJCOM owning the requested assets.
         8.18.1.3. If the request is for an Air Mobility Command (AMC) asset, submit
         requirements to HQ AMC/DOOM at least 45 days before the event date for
         consideration at the monthly Joint Airborne and Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT)
         planning conference.
   8.18.2. Off-Base.
         8.18.2.1. When a military unit is making the initial request, submit these requests,
         through channels, to SAF/PAN (Info AF/XOO) at least 45 days before the event date.
         SAF/PAN coordinates all OASD-approved events with AF/XOO to determine extent
         of operational participation authorized.
         8.18.2.2. If the request is for an AMC asset, submit requirements to HQ AMC/DOOM at
         least 60 days before event date for approval or disapproval at the monthly JA/ATT
         planning conference.
8.19. Memorial or Funeral Ceremony--Aerial Event. All requirements must be validated
with Mortuary Affairs. Refer to AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program, and AFI 11-209, Air
Force Aerial Events, for guidance.
8.20. Retirement and Change of Command Ceremonies--Aerial Event.
      8.20.1. On-Base.
         8.20.1.1. These military events are approved for only the following personnel: CSAF,
         VCSAF, Combatant Commander (COCOM), MAJCOM/CC/CV, NAF/CC, Center/CC
         or State Adjutant Generals. Any other aerial events for the sole purpose of recognizing
         individuals who are retiring, or for change-of-command ceremonies, are prohibited
         without the consent of the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff. AF/CV will approve on a case-
         by-case basis. Submit these requests, through channels, to HQ USAF/XOO (Info HQ
         USAF/XOOO) at least 45 days before the event date.
   8.20.2. Off-Base. Aerial events for retirement or change-of-command ceremonies are not
   authorized at any off-base locations.
      8.20.3. Refer to AFI 11-209, Air Force Aerial Events, for complete guidance.
8.21. Performance Record Attempts--On Base or Off Base.
   8.21.1. OASD(PA)/CRL is the approval authority. The Air Force may compete where
   appropriate, for official world and “world class“ records and participate, on a selective basis,
   in flights of a spectacular nature. Record attempts are restricted to aircraft that have been
   assigned to operational units for at least six months and should not imply competition
   among the services. Aircraft altitude, speed, endurance, and individual performance
   record attempts must be concerned with keeping the public appraised of U.S. engineering
   technology capabilities. MAJCOMs are encouraged to evaluate resources on a
   recurring basis to determine their capability to establish a new record or to reclaim
   existing ones.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                          187


   8.21.2. A MAJCOM desiring to perform a record flight or flight of a spectacular nature
   will first determine that the flight would not be of excessive cost or detract from
   operational posture. After these determinations are made, submit the request to HQ
   USAF/XOO (info SAF/PAN), including the type of flight to be flown, record to be
   established or reclaimed and the total cost of the attempt, at least 45 days before the event
   date.
   8.21.3. Costs associated with attempting a record flight or flight of a spectacular nature will
   be borne by the MAJCOM submitting the request. Additionally, the cost to register the
   record with the National Aeronautical Association (NAA) or any other organization will be
   borne by the MAJCOM submitting the request.
   8.21.4. Requests to establish or reclaim an aeronautical record must be approved at a
   minimum by HQ USAF/CC and XO and SAF/PAN before requesting OASD(PA) approval.
   Additionally, SAF/AQ must also approve the use of any aircraft or equipment in an R&D
   program.
8.22. Civilian Aerial Demonstrations On Base. Air Force policy on civilian aerial
demonstrations and performances for on-base events sets awareness of aviation heritage as a
primary objective. While it is the intent of HQ USAF that DoD aerial demonstration teams
normally will perform aerobatics at or over Air Force installations, qualified civilian performers
may be permitted to provide aerial demonstrations, flyovers, and static displays to supplement
or augment DoD teams. Commanders must select civilian organizations whose aircraft are of
historic military significance and whose performances clearly reinforce and promote a better
understanding of the Air Force. The majority of performances should be military.
8.23. Supporting Special Events. Requests for non-aviation related military support of public
programs should be addressed to the nearest military installation, using the DD Form 2536,
Request for Military Band/Personnel/Equipment Support. Decision criteria should include the
nature of the program, sponsor, site, and support. Commanders may authorize local program
support without further authorization. Requests for aircraft participation at civilian locations
require a DD Form 2535, Request for Military Aviation Support. DD Forms 2535/6 are designed
to aid civilian sponsors and provide required information for approval authority. When possible,
the Public Affairs officer should provide the sponsor with the form and assist the sponsor in
filling out the form completely. The Public Affairs officer should also contact the local
recruiter if appropriate. Additional consideration should be given to integrating military assets
into key civilian events, and ensuring proper Air Force message placement in all public events.
   8.23.1. All requests for Air Force support within the National Capital Region must be sent
   to SAF/ PAN using DD Form 2535 or 2536, as appropriate. Requests must be sent to
   SAF/PAN at least 60 days before the event date or as soon as the event is known, and will be
   coordinated with OASD(PA).
   8.23.2. When OSD, the Secretariat, or HQ USAF receives direct requests from civilian
   sponsors, SAF/PAN will ask the MAJCOMs with the base closest to the requester to appoint
   a project officer to coordinate all Air Force participation at that approved event (i.e. Armed
   Forces Day; Veterans Day). The project officer should establish initial contact with the
   sponsor as soon as possible and maintain close liaison to assure the sponsor that the Air
   Force will provide assistance and participation as appropriate. Project officers are
   authorized direct communication with participating commands and military services.
188                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   Provide SAF/PAN a report of all planned participation at least 15 days before the event and
   a brief after-action report within 30 days after the event.
   8.23.3. All events scheduled for or that may attract national or international media coverage
   are coordinated with OASD(PA). Send requests, through channels, to SAF/PAN at least 45
   days before the event date or as soon as the event is known.
   8.23.4. Exceptions-to-policy will be kept to a minimum. Any requests for exceptions
   must be approved by the unit commander and concurred with by the MAJCOM Director of
   Operations and PA as appropriate, before submission to SAF/PAN.

Section 8F—Interagency Programs

8.24. Air Force Participation in 1nteragency Programs. Occasionally, the Air Force takes
part in and supports interagency exhibits and programs such as the Paris Air Show and the
Farnborough Air Show. Each Air Force component of a combatant or specified command is
guided by the policy on interagency programs issued by that command. However, the policy
stated below on programming, preparing budget estimates, and financing Air Force participation
in interagency programs applies to all Air Force activities.
   8.24.1. Coordination. The Air Force must work through, and obtain approval from,
   OASD/PA, on all interagency programs. In supporting such programs, the Air Force
   objectives are to strengthen its community relations program and provide Public Affairs
   support to all Air Force activities worldwide. Therefore, when the objectives of the event
   are social, cultural, or economic, orient Air Force participation toward community relations.
   8.24.2. Coordination Between OASD/PA and SAF/PAN. The Air Force point of contact with
   OASD/ PA is SAF/PAN. When an Air Force component receives a request to take part in
   or to support an interagency action, it must send that request through channels to SAF/PAN
   for determination and processing through OASD/PA.
   8.24.3. Presidential Authorization for Programs.      When the President feels U.S.
   participation in an International Fair or other public or private demonstration of U.S.
   economic and cultural progress will strengthen international relations, the President
   authorizes such participation.
   8.24.4. Program Costs. OASD/PA, in coordination with the Assistant Secretary of Defense
   (Comptroller), will furnish program guidance to the Air Force and overseas Combatant
   Commands on all programmed support with a minimum of 18-months lead-time. Each
   MAJCOM involved in interagency or combatant command matters must include such
   support costs, known in advance, in its annual budget. In events not previously planned and
   funded, the Air Force may take part to the extent of its existing capabilities and available
   funds. Unless the Air Force has a primary interest in a program, reimbursement must be
   received for any support given a federal agency outside DOD.
   8.24.5. Loan of Property. The Air Force may provide property (including foreign excess
   property) on a loan basis to the manager of a U.S. national exhibition or commercial
   exhibition under conditions approved by SAF/PA. This property may include, for example,
   electric generators, office equipment, or expendable items. When the purpose of the loan has
   been fulfilled, the property must be returned. Costs, including loss, any necessary repairs,
   reconditioning after use and transportation must be borne by the requesting agency.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         189


Section 8G—Speeches and Public Appearances

8.25. Acceptance Criteria. Official public appearances and speeches by Air Force people,
military or civilian, constitute essential parts of the Air Force program to keep the public
informed. Individual members of the Air Force at all levels, but particularly General Officers
and other key personnel, should make every effort to fill requests unless overriding or previous
official commitment precludes acceptance. See paragraph 8.6 for additional guidance. Apply
the following criteria:
   8.25.1. Participation does not interfere with assigned duties.
   8.25.2. Remarks are confined to discussion of subjects within the Air Force purview.
   8.25.3. Views expressed are nonpartisan, consistent with AFI 51-902, Political Activities by
   Members of the U.S. Air Force.
   8.25.4. Participation does not imply Air Force sponsorship or agreement with the statements
   of others that may be partisan in nature or contrary to national policy.
   8.25.5. Participation does not violate DOD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation.
   8.25.6. Remarks or speeches have been reviewed (or cleared) for security and policy.
8.26. Audiences. The objective of the speakers program is to reach dynamic sectors of the local
community, region, or nation that are unfamiliar with Air Force matters. Speakers should target
those audiences for the majority of their speeches. This is absolutely vital for senior-level
speakers who, because of rank or expertise, can best help the American people understand
defense issues and priorities. The challenge for Public Affairs is to maintain a speakers program
that attempts to reach a cross-section of society.
   8.26.1. Include those that may not be knowledgeable of Air Force missions, programs and
   issues or not predisposed to accept an Air Force position on an issue. Examples of a
   non-choir audience include the following: Chamber of Commerce general membership;
   non-defense business/industry groups-civic clubs; World Affairs Councils; academic
   student-faculty forums (excluding ROTC); city/state government officials; non-defense
   professional organizations; media organizations; and religious groups.
   8.26.2. Other audiences may have some knowledge of the Air Force: those that include
   veteran and retiree groups, defense-related associations, defense industry management clubs
   or other gatherings in which 51 percent of the attendees have a personal, professional,
   scientific or business stake in defense. Examples include the following: Air Force
   Association; Armed Forces Communications Electronics Association; Chamber of
   Commerce Military Affairs Councils; base community councils; VFW; American Legion;
   AFROTC and USAFA graduation/commissioning ceremonies; and U.S. Air Force Academy
   parents clubs.
   8.26.3. Internal Audiences. Includes active duty, reserve, guard, AFROTC or USAFA
   personnel and family members. Also, Department of the Air Force, other service and
   DOD civilian workers and family members are considered as part of the internal audience.
   The 50/50 rule applies: if the audience is made up of more than 50 percent of the above, it is
   considered an internal group.
190                                            AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


8.27. Speaker’s Bureau. Maintain records on active or potential military and civilian
employee speakers. These records usually include brief biographical data, information about
the type of organization, past engagements and subject matter the speaker is qualified to discuss.
   8.27.1. Set up a folder for each serviced and potential civilian organization or activity.
   Folders may be established either individually or comprehensively--based on local, state, or
   national groupings--as dictated by the nature and volume of speech requests. Each folder
   should include information needed to evaluate requests from the organization, points of
   contact, copies of all correspondence, after-action reports, and recommendations for future
   participation.
   8.27.2. Maintain Speech Material Files. These should include copies of speeches given by
   commanders and staff, plus speech material received from higher headquarters. Periodically
   solicit information for speeches from commanders and staff officers for the file. Speech
   material is available on the Air Force Issues and Answers Web site at
   http://www.issues.af.mil.
8.28. Speechwriting. AFNEWS produces original speeches as part of the Air Force Speech
Packages. They are available on the Air Force Issues and Answers Web site at
http://www.issues.af.mil. In addition, Air Force News Service (AFNEWS) formats and posts
on AF Link speeches delivered by senior Air Force leaders. Commanders should use
appropriate themes developed by SAF/PA.
8.29. Security and Policy Review. Speakers must have their speeches reviewed for security
and policy issues at the appropriate level. See Chapter 15 in this AFI for complete info.
8.30. Payment and Honoraria. Payment or honoraria cannot be accepted for making an
official on- or off-duty public appearance or speech done as part of official duties. However,
payment and honoraria can be accepted, for public appearances or speeches that are done off-
duty and are unrelated to official duties. Consult the servicing Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) for
more information. Refer to DOD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation.
   8.30.1. Travel Expenses. In some cases, official travel expenses can be paid by the
   organization requesting a speaker. Coordinate with the SJA.
   8.30.2. Federal government employees may not accept any gift of value given to them
   because of their government position, or by a “prohibited source.“ Gifts valued under
   $20 may be accepted because it falls under the “de minimus“ rule, which is one of many gift
   exceptions for DOD personnel. If the gift is valued over $20, you would not reject it
   outright, but would review the other gift exceptions to determine if it was acceptable. If a
   gift is not acceptable, the employee generally must return it to the donor or pay its fair
   market value.
8.31. U.S. Air Force Representation at Events in the National Capital Region.
      8.31.1. Personal Responsibilities.
         8.31.1.1. Invitations for Air Force military or civilians who are invited to speak or
         appear at public events in the National Capital Region must be reported to SAF/PAN
         immediately upon receipt.
         8.31.1.2. Indicate whether the invitation will be accepted, declined, or request
         guidance from SAF/PA.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         191


   8.31.2. Unit Responsibilities.
       8.31.2.1. Units which are responsible for local community relations programs in the
       Washington Metropolitan Area do not need to coordinate events that have only local
       impact, unless senior Air Force leaders are involved.
       8.31.2.2. Exceptions are events sponsored by or in honor of foreign nationals.
       Invitations in honor of foreign dignitaries should be reported to SAF/IA, DSN 225-
       7262 or (703) 695-7262, according to AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds—
       Guidance and Procedures.
       8.31.2.3. Air Force Protocol, DSN 227-8341 or (703) 697-8341, provides advice on state
       and official social functions.
   8.31.3. SAF/PA Responsibilities. SAF/PAN advises whether or not attendance is desirable,
   optional, or inadvisable.
8.32. Congratulatory Messages. Anniversary messages from the Secretary of the Air Force
and Chief of Staff must be requested; they are not issued automatically. MAJCOM
anniversaries normally are recognized at five-year intervals; and bases, on their 50th
anniversaries. Other requests for messages should be carefully considered before being
submitted.
   8.32.1. Requests from MAJCOMs, bases, public groups, or individuals are handled by
   SAF/PAN.
   8.32.2. Requests from foreign units and governments should be referred to SAF/IA.
   8.32.3. All requests must be received at least 45 days in advance of the anniversary date
   and should include the following information: recommended text; full name, title, grade, and
   organization of the person to whom the message is to be addressed; brief outline of the event,
   to include date, time, place, and other data; how message will be used; date the message
   should be received by the requester; other material useful as background information about
   the event or in justifying the recommended message.
   8.32.4. To request congratulatory messages from higher-ranking government officials,
   although rarely done, use above guidelines.
8.33. 1nviting Distinguished Visitors. Air Force units may invite distinguished visitors to
attend appropriate functions.
   8.33.1. Government Officials. Invitations should be sent to the following distinguished
   individuals through channels to SAF/PAN: members of the Supreme Court, Cabinet
   Secretaries, and Principal Deputies to Cabinet Secretaries.
       8.33.1.1. Commands must favorably endorse invitations for them to receive approval at
       HQ Air Force level.
       8.33.1.2. Air University and USAFA. Correspond directly with Cabinet Officers and
       Principal Deputies to Cabinet Officers to speak or appear at academic functions. On
       acceptance of any such invitation, notify SAF/PAN immediately.

       processed according to AFI90-401, Air Force Relations with Congress.
   8.33.2. Military Officials. Invitations may be made directly by or through commanders
   of MAJCOMs or FOAs to senior officials up to and including: the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of
   Staff; the Secretary or Chief of Staff of the Army; the Secretary of the Navy or the Chief
   of Naval Operations; the Secretary or Chief of Staff of the Air Force; or the Commandant,
   U.S. Marine Corps. When an invitation from an Air Force unit is accepted by any of the
   officials listed above, notify SAF/PAN immediately.
   8.33.3. Foreign Nationals. Invitations from CONUS commanders to foreign nationals to
   visit U.S. Air Force facilities or to take part in U.S. Air Force-sponsored functions must be
   approved by the Secretary of Air Force, International Affairs Division (SAF/IA).
   8.33.4. Invitations to other distinguished visitors are procedural matters for commands.
   However, advise SAF/PAN immediately when the appearance of a distinguished visitor at an
   Air Force function is considered likely to attract national attention. Note: Invitations for
   citizens of national prominence to take part in or attend memorial and dedication programs
   are processed according to AFI 36-3108, Memorialization Program and Ceremonies.
   8.33.5. Congressional Visits. Information concerning visits by members of Congress is
   in AFI90-401, Air Force Relations with Congress.
   8.33.6. Joint Civilian Orientation Conference (JCOC). This is a periodic meeting arranged
   in Washington, D.C., and includes interested civilian opinion leaders who are personally
   invited by the Secretary of Defense and briefed on military affairs and taken on tours of Air
   Force installations. These tours should be given the highest priority since they are
   SECDEF-sponsored, with assistance from OASD/PA and SAF/PAN. SAF/PA sends a
   message to Air Force units annually requesting nominations. The message outlines nominee
   criteria and instructions for submission.         The JCOC web site is located at
   http://www.dod.mil/jcoc.

Section 8H—Air Force Tour Program

8.34. General Guidelines. The Air Force Tour Program increases community leaders‟
awareness and understanding of the Air Force‟s role in national security by inviting groups of
civilian opinion leaders to witness the Air Force mission by visiting Air Force installations. Air
Force units carefully select candidates who are capable of disseminating information to various
publics about the Air Force‟s programs. Participants may travel on Air Force aircraft to view
the Air Force in action in accordance with DOD4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, and
AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
   8.34.1. All Air Force tours are conducted under the same basic guidelines, and there are
   different types of tours--National Civic Outreach, Community Relations and base tours.
   Combatant and Specified Commands and ANG conduct their own tour programs.
       8.34.1.1. Prior to planning or scheduling any Air Force National Civic Outreach or
       Community Relations tour, other than a routine base tour covered in Section 8I, a tour
       plan template (Figure 8.1.) must be completed and forwarded to the MAJCOM Public
       Affairs office for concurrence and appropriate command level approval. MAJCOMs
 AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                              193


         sponsoring tours must submit the completed tour plan template to SAF/PANC for
         review. The template serves as a valuable planning tool and a means to ensure a tour is
         the appropriate tool to reach the communication objective(s) and to bring more focus,
         efficiency, and integrity to the overall Air Force Tour Program.
     8.34.2. While planning tour activities, keep in mind OASD/PA guidance, which states
     civilian visitors are not permitted to operate any item of military equipment when such
     operation could cause, or reasonably be perceived as causing an increased safety risk. This
     policy is effective regardless of how closely military personnel supervise the civilian
     visitors. This policy is not designed to restrict civilian visitors from observing their military;
     it is designed to ensure their visits are conducted as safely as possible. This policy
     specifically includes any aspect of the actual operation of military vessels, aircraft, vehicles
     and crew-served weapons systems. Small arms weapons firing may be allowed with local
     commander approval.

          8.34.2.1. Tours are not intended to produce media coverage, however, media queries
          concerning the program or a specific tour must be answered factually, completely, and
          in a timely manner. Tour participants must be advised prior to the event that names,
          business affiliations, and any other information releasable under FOIA will be released if
          queried by the media.
          8.34.2.2. Working members of the press and members of the U.S. Congress and their staff
          will not be included since there are programs in place for these groups. Members of
          local and state government, however, should be included.
          8.34.2.3. In areas where major units are collocated, the tour host will coordinate tour
          plans and guest lists with other Air Force Public Affairs offices in the area before
          extending invitations.
          8.34.2.4. Local Air Force recruiting squadron commander and/or recruiters, AFROTC
          detachments, ANG and AFRC sources, as well as area bases, should be contacted for
          suggested tour invitees.
          8.34.2.5. Commands are responsible for adhering to the provisions of this instruction,
          including requests for any required higher headquarters approval.
          8.34.2.6. The Air Force Tour Program must withstand scrutiny at all times. Activities
          perceived as extravagant jeopardize the viability of this program.
 8.35. National Civic Outreach Tours.
     8.35.1. Tours are centrally funded and managed at SAF/PANC.
     8.35.2. SAF/PANC manages the overall annual Air Force Tour Program; overseeing tours
     which are national in scope and based on themes and messages outlined in the Strategic
     Communications Plan. The Air Force Public Affairs Council (AFPAC) coordinates and
     approves suggested themes in advance. SAF/PANC and MAJCOMs will coordinate to
     assign execution responsibility for individual tours. Additional themes for national civic
     outreach tours may be proposed at lower echelons, and submitted through MAJCOMs
     along with the tour plan template (Figure 8.1) to SAF/PANC for approval.
     8.35.3. Issues, focus or themes must have more than local or regional impact.
     8.35.4. The target audience is composed of stakeholders generally associated with a major
     strategic issue or persons who are force multipliers in communicating Air Force messages.
       8.35.5. Limit National Civic Outreach Tours to two days.
     8.35.6. SAF/PANC will identify a senior Air Force leader and PA escort(s) to accompany
     tour.
     8.35.7. MAJCOMs and wings may be asked to nominate invitees.
     8.35.8. MAJCOMs may be asked to provide assistance.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         195


   8.35.9. SAF/PANC will request and monitor funds through HQ AMC/PA for all National
   Civic Outreach tours, Air Staff, Secretariat, SAF/PA field offices and 11th Wing-sponsored
   tours.
   8.35.10. AMC will, in coordination with SAF/PANC, budget funds for all SAF/PA-managed
   tours via the program objective memorandum (POM) process.
8.36. Community Relations Tours.
   8.36.1. Often referred to in the past as wing-level civic leader tours, the target audience is
   composed of stakeholders connected to a local issue or where general civic education can be
   justified.
   8.36.2. MAJCOMs and other authorized sponsors are responsible for determining the
   method to budget and fund for airlift support. Fiscal year funds should be requested through
   the appropriate MAJCOM budgeting process.
   8.36.3. Tours are limited to one day. MAJCOM/PA is the approval authority for exception to
   the policy, authorizing a two-day tour.
   8.36.4. There is no limit on the number of Community Relations tours that may be
   performed as long as justification is provided via the tour plan template and upon MAJCOM
   concurrence.
   8.36.5. Not all Community Relations tours require airlift. Commanders should consider all
   alternatives in an effort to meet the communication objective(s).
      8.36.5.1. If airlift is used, MAJCOM is approval authority.
      8.36.5.2. Airlift will be flown as a special assignment airlift mission (SAAM).
   8.36.6. Tour should be local or regional issue driven and focused.
      8.36.6.1. Itinerary must be developed to meet specific objective(s) with measurable
      result(s).
8.37. General Tour Guidance.
   8.37.1. Any tour that is three or more days in duration requires a waiver approved by
   SAF/PANC. Submit requests for waiver prior to invitations being sent out, to SAF/PANC
   and include an itinerary and a letter of justification. Due to the longer flying times for
   PACAF and USAFE unit tours, PACAF is allowed four-day tours, and USAFE three-day
   tours, if approved by MAJCOM. Tour durations which exceed any of these limits require a
   waiver approved by SAF/PANC.
   8.37.2. Sponsors must indicate special aircraft configuration, including seating, comfort
   pallets, etc., with the appropriate supporting airlift unit scheduler when arranging airlift
   support.
   8.37.3. Sponsors must coordinate group accommodations through base lodging in order
   to avoid potential personal liability for unused rooms.
   8.37.4. CONUS units must conduct tours within the CONUS.
   8.37.5. Group should be comprised of no more than 40 participants, or no less than 25,
   including escorts.

   8.37.6. Consider theme-based tours, such as environmental, small business, personnel,
   education, and others. For all tours, specific communication objectives must be
   developed and forwarded for approval via the tour plan template.
   8.37.7. Sponsoring organizations are encouraged to present a balanced view of conditions
   and issues, including areas for improvement as well as successes.
   8.37.8. Schedule orientations, demonstrations and briefings during normal duty hours.
   Local PA offices are responsible for ensuring that all briefings, demonstrations, and
   orientations are cleared for presentation to the general public.
      8.37.9. Limit time spent in briefings and increase contact with people and operations.
   8.37.10. Include a senior Air Force representative and a PAO at the point of origin as
   military escorts on flight. Air Force escorts, including the host, should not exceed 20% of
   the total.
      8.37.11. Retain emergency information on each participant until the end of the tour.
      8.37.12. Ensure tours are not composed of members from predominantly one organization.
   8.37.13. Include participants from a cross-section of community or business leadership
   (consider age, gender, race, ethnic and occupational backgrounds). Opinion leaders who can
   influence public opinion for the theme/objective selected for the tour, or inform and educate
   their communities and peers, should be considered.
      8.37.14. Issue invitations only on a by-name, by-tour basis. Fill last minute cancellations in
      the same manner.
   8.37.15. Provide biographies of tour senior hosts/escorts, fact sheets and other materials on
   units to be visited, pertinent weapons systems, force modernization programs, Air Force
   Core Values and Competencies, and current Air Force themes and messages.
   8.37.16. Aerial photography on aircraft is allowed. See Chapter 17 paragraph 5, Public
   Affairs Aerial Photography.
   8.37.17. Do not schedule tours to the Pentagon or the National Capital Region.
   8.37.18. Do not include peripheral activities (such as golfing or other athletic events).
   8.37.19. Do not provide alcoholic beverages to guests aboard aircraft and buses.
   8.37.20. Do not include spouses or retired military members unless they qualify as bona fide
   opinion leaders in their own right.
   8.37.21. Evening activities should be an integral part of the education process, not purely
   a social event. Use the time for appropriate speakers and interaction with leadership. If
   available, include a performance by an element of an Air Force Band.
8.38. Participant Requirements.
   8.38.1. Confirm they are in good health and physical condition.
   8.38.2. Assume full financial responsibility for their own lodging, meals and other
   expenses during the tour.
   8.38.3. Furnish the name, address and telephone number of an emergency contact.
 AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                        197


     8.38.4. Disclose any special dietary requirements or other restrictions.
 8.39. Money Management. Because participants in the Air Force Tour Program are required to
 pay their own expenses, the hosting unit must decide the best way to pay for meals, lodging,
 and other included expenses. Priority should be given to making bill payment the least
 cumbersome on everyone -- the escorts, the guests, and the payees.
     8.39.1. All group lodging reservations must be made through the base lodging office.
     Under no circumstances may government credit cards, personal credit cards or personal
     checking accounts be used to hold group reservations. If only off-base lodging is available,
     recommend using the fund established for collectively managing guest‟s expenses be used
     for any lodging deposit normally associated with commercial hotels.

 Section 8I—Base Tours and Open Houses

 8.40. Base Tour General Guidelines. Tours tell a portion of the Air Force story to visitors and
 should be tailored to coincide with the interests of different age groups.
     8.40.1. Classified Information. Protecting classified information must be a matter of prime
     concern in any tour program.
     8.40.2. Coordination. Public Affairs must have written procedures, coordinated with base
     security forces, on how to handle all types of occurrences.
     8.40.3. Foreign Nationals. They may be given the standard community relations base tours
     provided to U.S. citizens. All such requests, at minimum, should be coordinated through the
     MAJCOM foreign disclosure office. The request should include the name of each visitor,
     country of origin, and proposed tour agenda. In no case should a commitment be made or
     implied until approval is received.
     8.40.4. Other Military-Related Categories. Foreign military trainees, DOD, or Air Force-
     sponsored groups traveling under the authority of invitational travel orders, and foreign
     dependents of U.S. Armed Forces personnel may take part in base tours without higher
     headquarters approval.

 8.41. Base Open House General Guidelines. Open houses provide an opportunity for
 citizens to gain an understanding of Air Force missions and military capabilities, as well as the
 skills and professionalism of its people. Commanders are encouraged to execute an open house
 with prudent oversight that balances the issues of force protection and operations tempo with the
 expected benefits of opening the base to the public. Complete Air Force Open House Guidance
 and public affairs checklist will be listed in upcoming AFI 10-1004, Conducting Air Force Open
 Houses.
     8.41.1. Open Houses should not be (or convey the image of) a fair, carnival, circus, civilian
     air show, or display of commercial products, and should inspire patriotism and aid in military
     recruiting.
     8.41.2. Open Houses should highlight the base mission and Air Force life, and do not always
     have to be an air show. Commanders may consider opening dining facilities, dormitories,
     maintenance shops, classrooms, flight simulators, and other unclassified facilities during a
     non-aviation-related Open House.
     8.41.3. Commanders should hold Open Houses when considered in the best interest of their
     overall community relations programs.
     8.41.4. A base Open House can be a major activity. Project officers should be senior in
     rank and familiar with flight and maintenance activities to ensure the success of the event.
     8.41.5. Due to extensive PA involvement, the Public Affairs officer should not be appointed
     overall Open House project officer. The Public Affairs officer must work closely with the
     project officer to ensure public awareness and attendance at the Open House.
       8.41.6. Refer to AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility, for restrictions on
       commercial sponsorship and the use of non-appropriated funds in support of Open Houses.

 Section 8J—Request for Information (Non-media)

 8.42. General Guidelines. Responding promptly, accurately, and completely to requests for
 information or complaints is an important part of Public Affairs. People often develop lasting
 impressions of the Air Force and the professionalism of its members based on the quality and
 timeliness of replies they receive. Many times correspondence is the only direct contact a person
 or organization has with the Air Force.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           201


   8.42.1. Responses should be written in a clear, concise style. Avoid Air Force jargon,
   technical language, and acronyms.
   8.42.2. Whenever possible, current, previously cleared information should be used in
   responding. However, when requests require more detail or involve sensitive subjects,
   proper coordination is essential.
   8.42.3. When appropriate, refer requesters to AF Link and AF Link Jr., or your base‟s home
   page.
8.43. U. S. Citizens. A positive attitude toward the Air Force should be developed or
reinforced in the minds of young people who request information. This could be an important
factor later in their lives when they may consider an Air Force career. Send any letters
indicating the writer is interested in joining the Air Force to: U.S. Air Force Recruiting Service,
Randolph AFB, TX 78150-5421.
   8.43.1. Public Affairs is not expected to invest excessive time and resources to research and
   develop materials for student research papers. Provide materials you have readily
   available, politely advise requesters their request goes beyond your research capability, and
   refer them for further information to other appropriate sources of information, such as
   specific magazines, books, public or university libraries, industry, or other Air Force units.
8.44. Congressional Requests and Inquiries. Handle according to AFI 90-401, Air Force
Relations with Congress.
8.45. Regional, State, and Local Government Officials and Special Interest Group
Requests. S p e cial care must be taken to get a fully coordinated staff response and concurrence
by the commander, and higher headquarters when appropriate, before answering these requests.
8.46. Foreign Nationals. Public Affairs must respond directly to all routine foreign national
requests for unclassified information approved for public release. All other requests should be
sent to the local OSI detachment and to the MAJCOM foreign disclosure offices for release
determination. If release determination cannot be made at MAJCOM level, the request
will be sent to SAF/IA, Washington DC 20330-2000.

Section 8K—Community Participation

8.47. Guidelines. The Air Force believes it is very important to live with its civilian neighbors
as an integral and desirable element in the community. This requires a continuous working
partnership between the Air Force and all civilian communities. Such a partnership should
include every area of Air Force and civilian community life. The base and its appropriate
officers, senior NCOs and civilian employee leadership are encouraged and expected to take part
in community programs and organizations.
8.48. Commander and Public Affairs Responsibilities.
   8.48.1. Civic Leaders. Personal contact must be established with local civic leaders. The
   understanding and cooperation of these persons are important elements in conveying Air
   Force insight and in executing a successful overall community relations program.
   8.48.2. Local Organizations. Base personnel should be encouraged to join local
   organizations compatible with their interests.
202                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


       8.48.2.1. Public Affairs should maintain an organizational reference file to include
       titles and addresses, official missions and structure, places and scheduled meetings, and
       conventions.
       8.48.2.2. The commander or a designated representative should be ex-officio members
       who regularly attend meetings of key civic organizations representing a broad cross
       section of the community, such as the Chamber of Commerce.
       8.48.2.3. Key civic leaders or groups should be invited for a base tour and briefing to be
       hosted by the commander and staff.
   8.48.3. National Organizations. Except for the NCR, local commanders may deal directly
   with local and regional chapters of national organizations. Send questions about liaison
   and cooperation with local organizations through command channels to SAF/PAN.
   OASD/PA serves as the principal DOD point of contact for all national organizations
   (including their local and regional chapters in the NCR) on all matters except:
       8.48.3.1. Requests for information from an organization that bears directly on the Air
       Force.
       8.48.3.2. Requests for Air Force speakers.
       8.48.3.3. Those matters involving contractual or consulting relationships.
       8.48.3.4. Matters pertaining to scientific and technical information.        Scientific and
       technical services are administered by the Defense Logistics Agency.
8.49. Base-Community Council. One of the best ways to have good Air Force community
relations is through a Base-Community Council. The Base-Community Council is a joint
organization of representatives of an Air Force base and local leaders of the major segments of
the community. Membership of the council should not become static. Public Affairs should
recognize changes in the community and make sure civilian members on the council reflect
current attitudes and opinions of the community. The Base-Community Council offers a
distinct advantage over other community organizations, in that its membership is drawn from
a full spectrum of affiliations, including business, religious, educational, and professional.
   8.49.1. Council Objectives.
       8.49.1.1. Identify common interests of the civilian and military populations and support
       community efforts of mutual concern.
       8.49.1.2. Get full base and community leader participation to solve problems of mutual
       interest.
       8.49.1.3. Ensure maximum use of community facilities.
       8.49.1.4. Increase civilian understanding of the Air Force mission.
       8.49.1.5. Set up an effective organization to assist the commander and community leaders
       to carry out their mutual relations responsibilities.
       8.49.1.6. Give continuity to the community relations program.
   8.49.2. Council Membership. The actual make-up will vary according to the type and
   size of the base and the community. Functions usually fall into four categories.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           203


       8.49.2.1. Police, Health, and Safety Services.
       8.49.2.2. Housing and Commercial Services.
       8.49.2.3. Recreation, Educational, Religious, and Welfare Services.
       8.49.2.4. Public Relations, Hospitality, and Good Citizenship Activities.
   8.49.3. Getting Started. The ideal way to get community support for base-community
   councils is for several leading citizens or an established community group to help set up the
   organization.
       8.49.3.1. The senior host commander should invite selected leaders of the community to
       the base for an informal discussion about establishing a Base-Community Council.
       8.49.3.2. The commander and staff should brief the community leaders on matters
       affecting both the military and civilian populations. This briefing should include a
       discussion of the base‟s Air Force mission, its economic impact on the community, and
       base services available to the community.
       8.49.3.3. After determining support for a Base-Community Council, the commander
       should invite the mayor, president of the Chamber of Commerce, or another leading
       citizen to serve as co-chairperson of the Council.
       8.49.3.4. The commander should then ask the co-chairperson to invite other key civilians
       to serve on committees.
8.50. Civilian Advisory Board. It also may be desirable to form a Civilian Advisory Board
composed of civilian leaders who do not hold structured positions of membership on a Base-
Community Council or other group. The board can meet with the senior commander to discuss
mutual problems. These groups are informally organized.
8.51. Joint Councils. When there is more than one military installation in an area, community
relations efforts or programs should be coordinated when appropriate. Consideration should
be given to either forming a joint community council or providing for representation on the
separate councils.
8.52. 1nter-Service Support for Events. Some community relations programs involve
support from more than one military Service. Events of this nature include major national
veterans conventions, regional Veterans Day observances, major air shows, large civic
festivals, and inaugurals. When more than one military Service supports a program sponsored
by a civilian organization and the magnitude of the support warrants DOD coordination,
OASD/PA requests one military department to nominate an officer located in the area of the
program to serve as the coordinator of DOD support.
   8.52.1. When the Air Force is requested to nominate a DOD coordinator, SAF/PA requests
   the command with the installation closest to the event to nominate an officer. OASD/PA
   then designates the officer as the DOD coordinator. The DOD coordinator is responsible
   for coordinating all military support, including support by Air National Guard and Reserve
   Components. DOD coordinators are authorized direct liaison with OASD/PA.
   8.52.2. When the Air Force provides support for a particular program, SAF/PA requests
   appointment of a project officer, usually located within the area of the event, to represent the
   Air Force and assist the DOD coordinator.
204                                             AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   8.52.3. The DOD coordinator prepares an after-action report and sends it to OASD/PA within
   30 days following the program. Air Force project officers assist the DOD coordinator
   in preparing the after-action report by supplying the Air Force information. A copy of the
   report must be sent to SAF/ PAN.
8.53. Presidential Wreath Laying Ceremonies.
   8.53.1. The Office of the Military Assistant to the President provides the Presidential
   wreaths and arranges for their annual placement at the tombs, burial sites, and monuments of
   all former presidents. The Air Force, through the MAJCOM or FOA indicated, provides
   Presidential representatives at wreath laying ceremonies for the following Presidents:
   Millard Fillmore (ANG), 7 January, at Buffalo, New York and Lyndon B. Johnson (ANG),
   27 August, at LBJ Ranch, Texas.
   8.53.2. The minimum military grade for wreath laying ceremonies is a Colonel from the
   installation closest to the site, unless overriding considerations preclude the availability of a
   senior officer. The name, grade, title, address, and telephone number of each designated
   representative must be sent to SAF/PAN at least 65 days in advance of the month of wreath
   placement.
   8.53.3. SAF/PAN must give the names of Presidential representatives to the Special
   Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for forwarding to the Military Assistant to the
   President, who arranges final details of the ceremony.
8.54. Observances.
   8.54.1. Armed Forces Day. By Presidential Proclamation, Armed Forces Day is observed on
   the third Saturday of May. It provides a special occasion for the public to see the DOD
   establishment up close and to demonstrate the unity and common purpose of the Armed
   Forces. On Armed Forces Day, in keeping with the spirit of unification in the National
   Security Act of 1947, as amended, Air Force units must not observe an anniversary (or any
   other day of significance to the Air Force and its subordinate elements) at any location
   away from an Air Force base without specific authorization of OASD/PA.
      8.54.1.1. OASD/PA coordinates Armed Forces Programs at the national level. SAF/PA
      will pass OASD/PA guidelines to the field for each year‟s observance.
      8.54.1.2. Air Force activities will participate by extending hospitality to the public
      through open houses or similar events and by cooperating with community and
      organizational observances of Armed Forces Day as appropriate. In locations and
      situations where two or more military Services are represented, joint participation in
      community-sponsored programs is encouraged.
   8.54.2. Veterans Day Observances. The Administrator of Veterans Affairs is usually
   designated by Presidential Proclamation as the Chairperson of the Veterans Day National
   Committee. The objective of this Committee, comprised of representatives from major
   veterans organizations, is to stimulate and perpetuate national public interest in honoring all
   veterans of all wars on Veterans Day. Each year, this Committee designates certain
   communities as regional sites for observing this national holiday. DOD supports these
   observances by appointing a coordinator and approving military support, regional sites
   are designated to make sure proper priority and an appropriate level of support are available
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         205


   for these major observances. DOD policy is to provide military support for Veterans Day
   observances in communities designated as regional sites, as well as for smaller local
   observances held in communities not so designated.
8.55. Record Keeping. MAJCOMs and FOAs keep SAF/PA advised (on a timely basis) of
significant community relations programs, problems, and needs. Public Affairs will maintain
records of community relations programs and activities.
   8.55.1. Records include, as a minimum, date, place, and nature of the event; sponsoring
   organization; names and titles of sponsoring officials; names and titles of principal military
   participants; speakers, marching units, bands, exhibits, demonstrations, and equipment;
   administrative support provided; estimated size of civilian audience; and total additional
   cost to the government, if incurred.
   8.55.2. Records must be in sufficient detail to provide a basis for evaluating program
   effectiveness, answering inquiries from the Congress, the media, and the general public,
   providing recognition of outstanding command or individual accomplishments, and
   ensuring proper national level planning and coordination of programs involving other
   activities of the U.S. Government and foreign governments.

                                               Chapter 9

                             ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS

Section 9A—Purpose, Objectives, Policy and Lai

9.1. Purpose. Public involvement (P1), also known as community involvement, is legally
required for many environmental programs. The goal of P1 is to inform and involve specific
target audiences (portions of the general public and key regulatory agencies) during critical
decision-making windows in various Air Force Environment, Safety and Occupational Health
(ESOH) programs. This goal differs from the more traditional Public Affairs goal of program
advocacy. This chapter establishes responsibilities, policies, and procedures for organizing
and administering an effective and legally sufficient Air Force Public Affairs P1 program.
9.2. Objectives. The objective of the ESOH program is to develop and implement innovative,
integrated, and comprehensive solutions that enhance the Air Force‟s ability to project air power
globally. To support this key Air Force program, Public Affairs programs at all levels must
understand and plan for timely and consistent P1 that comply with both the letter and the spirit of
the environmental statutes. The primary Air Force ESOH messages are: sustaining readiness;
being a good neighbor; and leveraging resources.
9.3. Policy. 1t is Air Force policy to keep the public fully informed of and involved in past,
present and proposed actions that potentially could affect the environment and/or public health.
Air Force commanders and their staffs must adhere to the following principles:
   9.3.1. Air Force agencies at all levels must be prepared to grant public access to legally
   releasable final versions of unclassified documentation of environmental programs.
   Prompt, full, and accurate disclosure of this information conforms to DOD principles and
   legal requirements.      Although many environmental programs require disclosure of
   documents, this does not mean that all environmental documents should be made publicly
   available.    Because Air Force environmental documents usually contain sensitive
   information, any release of environmental documents must be coordinated with the
   applicable legal office. Although it is Air Force policy to release all information it is legally
   obligated to, there are many instances where sensitive information must be protected from
   release.
   9.3.2. Where the potential for public health issues exists, that information must be
   released in an expeditious and responsible manner.
   9.3.3. Air Force officials must be sensitive to civilian and military communities that may be
   affected by ongoing or proposed activities having possible environmental impacts.
      9.3.4. Air Force officials must comply with the spirit and intent of all federal, state, and local
      environmental IAWs as they relate to public involvement.
9.4. Applicable IAWs. As stated in AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality: Achieving and
maintaining environmental quality is an essential part of the Air Force mission.
   9.4.1. The Air Force is committed to: cleaning up environmental damage resulting from its
   past activities; meeting all environmental standards applicable to its present operations;
   planning its future activities to minimize environmental impacts; managing responsibly the
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           207


   irreplaceable natural and cultural resources it holds in public trust; and eliminating pollution
   from its activities wherever possible.
   9.4.2. In meeting its commitment to the environment, the Air Force complies with many
   environmental statutes, including, for example, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
   Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act.
   Environmental requirements exist in federal and state statutes and regulations, executive
   orders, and Air Force instructions (see AFPD32-70, Atch 3). Failure to comply with
   environmental IAWs can have severe impacts on the mission.

Section 9B—General Roles and Responsibilities

9.5. Public Affairs Responsibilities. As a critical member of the ESOH management team,
the PAO must ensure all members of the Public Affairs staff have appropriate training, are kept
current on local and national Air Force ESOH issues, and advise the interdisciplinary team on PI
requirements. Public Affairs will ensure news releases, newspaper display ads, and media
queries are properly coordinated with the interdisciplinary team (environmental, operations,
legal, medical, safety, logistics, and others) and other appropriate agencies or organizations
before releasing environmental information. This will be implied throughout this instruction
where public release of information is required or recommended. Specific Public Affairs
responsibilities include:
   9.5.1. Prepare a comprehensive Public Affairs plan that may include both basic PI efforts
   and supporting traditional Public Affairs products.
   9.5.2. Release all public announcements on ESOH issues after appropriate coordination with
   environmental, legal and health offices, and commanders.
   9.5.3. Notify local political, health, and environmental leaders prior to public release of
   information, if appropriate.
   9.5.4. Provide Public Affairs counsel and guidance to commanders and those staff agencies
   involved in conducting environmental programs.
   9.5.5. Review and ensure all draft environmental documents, particularly the executive
   summaries, are written in non-technical language that is understandable to the primary target
   audiences, the commander and the public.
   9.5.6. Be the Air Force point of contact for public and media queries.
   9.5.7. Coordinate and be the point of contact for all public meetings on ESOH issues.
   9.5.8. Place newspaper display ads (funded by proponent) and issue news releases at
   decision points and other significant stages in ESOH projects.
   9.5.9. Keep internal audiences informed through command channels on environmental
   issues and community concerns.
   9.5.10. Ensure compliance with required            public involvement actions for each
   environmental program.
   9.5.11. Maintain a complete record of all news releases made, public meetings held,
   queries answered, and media clips published concerning environmental programs. Ensure
208                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   proper placement of appropriate information into the Administrative Record and/or the
   Information Repository.
9.6. Environmental Planning Function (EPF). At any level of command, the EPF is the focal
point for the interdisciplinary team responsible for the environmental project. Public Affairs
should be a primary team member on the EPF.
9.7. General Environmental Program Responsibilities. Public Affairs is part of an
interdisciplinary team that provides both specific and general support to environmental program
objectives. Public Affairs communicates the Air Force commitment to public involvement and
environmental excellence. Public Affairs is the team‟s lead in incorporating community
concerns into the decision-making process in all environmental programs and emerging issues
(e.g., Community Based Environmental Program). Public Affairs should be familiar with the
content of the “Final Report of the Federal Facilities Environmental Restoration Dialogue
Committee“ or FFERDC. The four pillars of the Air Force‟s environmental program are
Compliance, Conservation, Restoration, and Pollution Prevention--each with specific and
overlapping programs to preserve and enhance the environment. Most of the individual
programs have legally mandated Public Affairs requirements.
   9.7.1. Public Affairs accomplishes community relations requirements by developing an
   environmental speaker‟s bureau, facilitating environmental educational outreach to local
   schools and conducting tours focusing on the four pillars of the environmental program.
   Public Affairs also helps plan and conduct Earth Day and other environmental awareness
   activities.
   9.7.2. Public Affairs coordinates and conducts media operations on emerging environmental
   issues.
   9.7.3. Public Affairs is in the chain of review on all environmental documentation that is
   releasable to the public.
   9.7.4. In addition to Restoration Advisory Board (RAB) participation, Public Affairs is a
   member of the Environmental Protection Committee (EPC) or the Environment, Safety and
   Occupational Health (ESOH) Committee, which reviews policy and serves as a steering
   group to coordinate and monitor the overall environmental program.
   9.7.5. Public Affairs communicates environmental information to the internal Air Force
   audience to inform and educate.
   9.7.6. Public Affairs promotes the Air Force environmental program through communicating
   success stories to external audiences. SAF/PA is the central point for coordinating and
   communicating environmental successes to national audiences. Installation and major
   command Public Affairs communicate environmental successes to local and regional
   audiences and forward local news releases and news clippings to SAF/PA for consideration
   in the national program.

Section 9C—Environmental Justice and Impact Analysis Process

9.8. Environmental Justice Background. Executive Order (EO) 12898 requires all federal
agencies to make environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                          209


appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its
programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations.
   9.8.1. Other than the EIAP process, currently no specific PA guidance for conducting
   community involvement activities in areas that may have environmental justice impacts
   currently exists. However, in the conduct of its public involvement program, Public Affairs
   should help ensure low income and minority groups are actively engaged in the EIAP
   process.
9.9. Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP). The Nationa l Envir onmental
Polic y Act (NEPA), 42 U.S. Code. 4321-4347, and the President‟s Council on Environmental
Quality (CEQ) regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 1500 through 1508)
require federal agencies to analyze potential environmental impacts of major federal actions
and alternatives which may significantly affect the environment and to use those analyses in
making decisions or recommendations concerning those proposed actions. To reach an
informed decision, NEPA requires an analysis of proposed major federal actions and alternatives
to identify potential environmental impacts, including community involvement, scientific
analysis and potential mitigation. 32 CFR Part 989, The Air Force Environmental Impact
Analysis Process, proscribes policies, responsibilities and procedures for the Air Force
EIAP in the United States and abroad. AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis
Process, implements 32 CFR Part 989 and ensures compliance with NEPA in completing the
EIAP. Public Affairs should consult with their legal advisors and EPF for a complete listing of
applicable environmental IAWs, regulations and instructions. NEPA requires an analysis of
proposed major federal actions and alternatives in order to identify potential environmental
impacts. It does not require decision-makers to use the most environmentally-friendly
alternative; it only requires that they be aware of and consider them.
   9.9.1. One of the key features of NEPA is the requirement for public input and comment
   during production of the NEPA document. Community involvement is central to the
   NEPA process. The Air Force fulfills this legal requirement through the EIAP. Therefore,
   Public Affairs must be aware of and involved with the EIAP at the earliest stages of and
   throughout a proposed action or project. All documents released to the public must be made
   available in information repositories by the EPF, such as public libraries and city halls. The
   IAW requires public input and comment during the production of the NEPA document.
   For classified documents, EIAP “public review and comment“ is generally accomplished
   by representatives who have proper security clearances from appropriate regulatory
   agencies; they review and comment in lieu of the general public.
   9.9.2. There are three levels of EIAP analysis, and, therefore, three levels of Public Affairs
   tasking in the EIAP. See Figure 9.1, Figure 9.2 and Figure 9.3.
       9.9.2.1. Categorical Exclusion (CATEX). CATEXs are types of actions that demonstrate,
       through prior analysis, clearly insignificant impacts on the environment (see 32 CFR
       Part 989). It is the most common EIAP action. The CATEX is reflected on AF Form
       813, AF Form 332, Decision Document (DD) Form 1391c, or elsewhere in an
       appropriate official file. These actions are grouped by category and are approved by
       SAF/MIQ and CEQ. If the CATEX criteria are met, no further environmental analysis or
       public involvement activity analysis is required. Public Affairs‟ role is generally limited
       to a quick review of the proposed action.
210                                               AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


         9.9.2.2. Environmental Assessment (EA). An EA is a concise public document that
         helps determine the extent of environmental impacts of a project and decides whether
         or not those impacts are significant. Every EA must lead to a decision to issue a
         Finding Of No Significant Impact (FONSI); to publish a notice of intent (NOI) to
         prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS); or to take no action on the proposal.
         Public Affairs needs to stay engaged throughout the investigation and decision-making
         process. While a range of Public Affairs efforts may occur during an EA, Public Affairs
         efforts are usually limited to one public notice and a subsequent public comment period.
         9.9.2.3. Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). This is used where there are probable
         environmental and/or socioeconomic impacts and subsequently a CATEX or EA is
         inadequate to provide the required level of analysis. The EIS is a detailed study
         analyzing all environmental and socioeconomic impacts of a proposed action and its
         alternatives through an extensive public involvement process. In-depth NEPA and risk
         communication training should be considered and is recommended at the earliest
         stages of an EIS. SAF/PAR is the primary contact for this type of advanced training.
      9.9.3. EIAP Public Affairs Responsibilities. Community involvement is central to the EIAP
      process. Public Affairs actions include:
         9.9.3.1. EIAP Document Reviews. Public Affairs must participate in the review of EAs
         and EISs developed by the proponent and the EPF to ensure they are written in lay terms
         and address concerns raised by the public.
         9.9.3.2. EIAP Public Notification. Notifying the public on the availability of an EA
         decision document under circumstances as listed in 32 CFR Part 989.15 (e) (2), or an
         EIS decision document must be made via display advertisement (not a legal ad), one
         sixteenth of a page (approximately4x5 inches in size) in a local or regional general
         circulation newspaper. A news release will also be sent to local media. The display ad is
         a paid newspaper advertisement, funded by the project‟s proponent. It should appear in a
         prominent section of general circulation newspapers rather than legal columns of papers.
         If there is a specific state requirement to use a legal advertisement for public
         notification of NEPA activities, then the legal advertisement should be used in
         conjunction with, not instead of, a public notice display advertisement. When
         determining how much public involvement is appropriate (how many news releases,
         display ads or meetings should be completed), Public Affairs should consider the
         following:
             9.9.3.2.1. The size of the proposal and the degree to which the public may be
             affected by the action.
             9.9.3.2.2. The anticipated level of public interest or controversy.
             9.9.3.2.3. The size of the area affected (geography and population).
             9.9.3.2.4. Past controversy associated with similar activities (i.e., air space
             reconfiguration, forestry management plans or timber cuts, and increased night
             operations or training).
             9.9.3.2.5. Whether the proposed action is one of national concern, is unprecedented,
             or normally requires an EIS.
 AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                            211


             9.9.3.2.6. The degree of any associated environmental controversy.
         9.9.3.3. Public Affairs will ensure news releases, newspaper display ads, and media
         queries are properly coordinated before releasing environmental information.

Section 9D—Environmental Restoration Program

9.10. IRP Cleanup Processes. The IRP is a comprehensive effort to identify, investigate,
evaluate and restore contaminated areas (hazardous disposal sites, landfills, storage facilities and
operational areas) on Air Force-owned properties. At the installation, major command, and air
staff levels, the civil engineer (environmental manager) is the office of primary responsibility
for the IRP. Public Affairs is OPR for community involvement activities in support of the IRP.
For more information on the IRP, consult AFI32-7020, The Environmental Restoration
Program.
9.11. General IRP Public Affairs Responsibilities. Each MAJCOM will establish an IRP
directive listing Public Affairs responsibilities that, at a minimum, fulfill public participation
requirements as stated in the National Oil Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan
(NCP); 40 CFR Part 300; EPA guidance on OSWER Directive 9230.0-3C; the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended by
the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986; and the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). These requirements apply to all IRP sites. In cases
where there may be no Public Affairs officer assigned to an installation, such as a government-
owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) facility, the responsible command will provide and
ensure a Public Affairs specialist or appropriate on-site representative carries out required
regulator activities. MAJCOMs will also maintain copies of documents and materials
accomplished by the installation-level Public Affairs officer (or selected on-site
representative) in support of the IRP, such as community relations plans (CRPs),
environmental updates, mailing lists, Information Repository indexes, news releases and fact
sheets. As a minimum, Public Affairs will:
   9.11.1. Function as the focal point for Public Affairs and/or community involvement
   aspects of proposed IRP actions.
   9.11.2. Provide guidance to the IRP staff on Public Affairs and/or community involvement
   requirements for all aspects of proposed IRP actions.
   9.11.3. Coordinate or assist in the coordination of Restoration Advisory Board (RAB)
   activities, including the initial community interest assessment process, advise the base
   commander and/or RAB co-chairperson of Public Affairs objectives pertaining to
   development, participation and support of the RAB and other required public involvement
   activities. Guidance on RAB activities is provided in accordance with the Federal Register
   notice on Restoration Advisory Boards, Vol. 61, No.152, 6 August 1996, Pages 4,0764-
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         217


  4,0771. At GOCO facilities, the Public Affairs specialist selected by the MAJCOM will
  work with GOCO personnel, regulatory agencies for that region and community members to
  implement RAB activities and other public involvement and media operations activities
  as appropriate and applicable to that community.
  9.11.4. Establish and maintain liaison with higher headquarters Public Affairs offices and
  concerned base agencies on all IRP Public Affairs and/or community involvement matters.
  Depending on the action itself or the stage of the IRP, Public Affairs may elect to coordinate
  with other agencies, local governments, or special interest groups on news releases,
  responses to media queries, or briefings. Because demographic conditions vary widely,
  Public Affairs must fully evaluate their local situations (to include stakeholders surrounding
  GOCO facilities) to ensure all concerned entities are in the communication channel.
  9.11.5. Notify civic leaders, spokespersons for local interest groups, and other interested
  parties on the mailing list of proposed program actions. This includes inviting these
  stakeholders to appropriate meetings, encouraging them to contribute ideas, and informing
  them of decisions. Continue these actions until all IRP activities, including remedial
  actions, are complete.
  9.11.6. Review all IRP reports and other environmental documents released to the public for
  effective risk communications language and possible community concerns. IRP reports
  are very technical reports; therefore, these documents should include an Executive
  Summary that can be understood by the general public.
  9.11.7. Develop and distribute products that provide regular updates on IRP activities.
  These products may include, but are not limited to progress reports, fact sheets, news
  releases and public notices designed to increase the community‟s understanding and
  involvement in the IRP. Distribute the materials through the mailing list and make them
  available at the Information Repository and to any interested individual or group upon
  request. See Figure 9.4
  9.11.8. Announce the availability of the appropriate documents by display advertisement
  when they are placed in the Information Repository or Administrative Record. Display
  advertisements will be placed in a prominent section of the local paper of general circulation.
  All public notifications require a minimum of a 1/16-page ad (some state or regional EPA
  offices require a larger advertisement). More than one event can be included in the
  advertisement. For example, the same advertisement can cover the contents of the proposed
  plan, public comment period and public meeting information. Ads are funded through the
  Environmental Restoration Account.
  9.11.9. Ensure internal audiences (base employees) are fully informed of IRP progress
  through the base newspaper, commander‟s calls, staff meetings, bulletin boards, computer
  network notes, etc.
  9.11.10. Maintain a list of qualified speakers to address state and local governments and
  civilian groups, and actively solicit audiences with civic groups and other community
  organizations. Public Affairs should solicit feedback from audiences to gauge the
  effectiveness of public meetings.
  9.11.11. Assist the program manager during 30-day public comment periods for such
  cleanup milestones as the Final Draft Feasibility Study, decision documents, or Records of
218                                              AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   Decision, and when a preferred alternative has been identified in the proposed plan. The
   comment period can be extended by 30 days or more upon request from the community.
   Public Affairs will place these documents in the installation‟s IRP Information Repository
   (housed at local libraries) at the beginning of the comment period to ensure public
   availability of the report. Publicize the dates of the comment period, date, time and
   location of the public meeting, and instructions on how to submit comments. Announce to the
   public by news release and display ad in a prominent section of a major local newspaper of
   general circulation. Legal notices may be used in addition to, but not in place of, a display
   advertisement.
      9.11.12. Assist in the preparation of any public meetings throughout the IRP.
9.12. IRP Public Involvement Requirements and Remedial Actions.
   9.12.1. Community Relations Plans (CRP), also known as Community Involvement
   Programs (CIP), are required by 40 CFR Part 300. This is the national authority for many
   environmental processes and programs that require public notification. The CRP is normally
   prepared early in the installation‟s IRP. It identifies issues of possible community concern,
   provides a basis for communication between the facility and the community, outlines how
   the public can participate in the decision-making process, and serves as a public record of
   community involvement during the investigative and remedial programs. The National
   Contingency Plan (NCP) requires CRPs for all CERCLA cleanups. See the EPA Community
   Relations in Superfund: A Handbook, and the EPA RCRA Public Involvement Manual for
   specific guidance of the CRP and overview of public involvement activities. Also see
   Figure 9.4, Information Repository Content List.
   9.12.2. IRP Public Involvement Requirements and Removal Actions. Removal actions may
   occur at any time during the normal process of the IRP. Removal actions can be performed
   in emergency or time-critical time frames to eliminate an imminent threat to human health
   or the environment, or to remove a source of contamination such as heavily contaminated
   soil or groundwater. All removal actions have specific public involvement and/or Public
   Affairs requirements, depending on the length of time to plan and perform the action. The
   following are the categories of removal actions and the associated Public Affairs
   requirements:
         9.12.2.1. Emergency. Refers to release or threatened releases of substances that require
         removal activities to begin within hours of the lead agency‟s determination that a
         removal action is necessary. There is usually insufficient time to publicize an
         emergency removal before it is complete. Prepare and publish a news release as soon as
         possible after the emergency removal.
         9.12.2.2. Time-Critical. Removal actions for which less than six months is available for
         planning before removal activities must begin on site. Public Affairs will:
             9.12.2.2.1. Prepare and publish a news release and display ad 60 days prior to
             initiation of on-site removal activity.
             9.12.2.2.2. Assist the EPF during a public comment period of not less than 30 days
             from the time the Administrative Record file is made available for public inspection.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                        219


          9.12.2.2.3. Assist in preparing responses to significant comments (responsiveness
          summary.)
       9.12.2.3. Non-Time-Critical. Non-time-critical removal actions are those requiring a
       planning period of more than six months before removal activities must begin on site.
       For these types of actions, Public Affairs will:
          9.12.2.3.1. Conduct community interviews.
          9.12.2.3.2. Prepare a CRP. If an installation CRP already exists, include the
          additional information for the removal action as an attachment to the original plan.
          During the next update, make sure the information is included in the CRP.
          9.12.2.3.3. Establish an Information Repository or add removal site information to
          the existing Information Repository.
          9.12.2.3.4. Prepare and publish a news release and display ad and brief
          description of the action.
          9.12.2.3.5. Assist the EPF in conducting a public comment period of not less than 30
          days on the action. Upon request, extend the comment period by a minimum of 15
          days.
          9.12.2.3.6. Assist in the preparation of the written responses to comments, which is
          part of the final decision document.
9.13. Release of IRP Findings. Draft IRP reports are solely for internal review and comment
and are not releasable. Public Affairs will release final IRP reports to the public.
   9.13.1. Public Affairs Responsibilities. Public Affairs will coordinate on the message,
   report, and draft letters of transmittal to the local legislators before they are sent to the
   major command for approval. Major command Public Affairs offices also will coordinate
   on the package before it is sent to the HQ USAF offices. SAF/LLP will handle
   congressional distribution.
   9.13.2. Advance copies of final reports are not releasable. Requesters of the document
   should be provided the release date and location. After releasing the final report, Public
   Affairs should, at a minimum, mail a copy of the executive summary to each requester.

  be appropriate to determine if there is a release that warrants “immediate” notification.

HIGH-INTEREST PROGRAMS:
At installations with major findings or high levels of local interest, the commander and the Air
Force may decide to conduct additional activities such as the following:
Site tours; Status reports to community; media briefings; RABs; Technical Review Committees
(regular meetings with interested parties and public representatives for program management
purposes);
Direct-mail news bulletins; public forums; media symposiums; other activities as appropriate
for the installation and program.


Section 9E—Restoration Advisory Boards and the Community Involvement Program (CIP)

9.14. General Information. The RAB is a community-based advisory body designed to act
as a focal point for the exchange of information between the Air Force and the local community
regarding environmental restoration (cleanup) activities.          The RAB members are:
representatives from the community; interested groups; local, state and federal regulatory
agencies; and the Air Force. RAB meetings are open to the public.
9.15. Community Involvement Program (CIP). The RAB does not replace other types of
community outreach and participation activities required by regulation or stipulated under this
AFI. The CIP is a component of the Community-Based ESOH (Environment, Safety, and
Occupational Health) Program (CBEP) being developed within SAF/MIQ (Deputy Assistant
Secretary of the Air Force for Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health). SAF/PAM is part
of the interdisciplinary team that develops and guides the CBEP management policies.
   9.15.1. CIP Purpose. The purpose of the CIP is to ensure that the community has the
   opportunity to participate in the IRP process.
   9.15.2. CIP Discussion. Public Affairs needs to train for and accomplish a coordinated
   public involvement program that supports the policy decisions of the Secretary of the Air
   Force, the Chief of Staff and senior leaders at HQ USAF, MAJCOMs, field operating
   agencies, direct reporting units, and subordinate organizations throughout the U.S. The
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           231


   traditional Public Affairs role within the military has primarily been one of advocacy. CIP
   uses different tools. It calls for consensus-building efforts based on active listening,
   dialogue and acceptance of community input without prejudging. The challenge is to create
   an atmosphere of trust that should allow solutions acceptable to most parties. It is a
   communications challenge meant to help bridge the scientific and technical objectives of the
   IRP.
   9.15.3. CIP Public Affairs Responsibilities. Expand Community Relations Partnerships.
   Public Affairs community relations‟ organizations must expand already established
   partnerships with civilian leaders and organizations to include base-level organizations.

Section 9F—Interaction with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)

9.16. Background. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) was
created by Congress to implement the health-related sections of CERCLA, as amended. ATSDR
is part of the Public Health Service within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Based in Atlanta, Georgia, the agency‟s mission is to prevent or mitigate adverse human health
effects resulting from exposure to hazardous substances in the environment.
9.17. Public Affairs Responsibilities. Risk communication is at the center of all
interactions with ATSDR. ATSDR normally issues news releases regarding site visits, public
meetings, and public availability sessions. Public Affairs at the installation will assist ATSDR in
gauging health concerns, identifying key community contacts, and obtaining a copy of the
community relations plan. Public Affairs will also assist in reviewing ATSDR-generated
documents. The installation SG Bioenvironmental Engineering Office is the main point of
contact for the Air Force‟s working relationship with ATSDR.

Section 9G—Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)

9.18. Background. RCRA provides a “cradle-to-grave“ system of rules regarding the
generation, transportation, treatment, disposal, and clean-up of hazardous wastes. RCRA
“Corrective Action” cleanup actions generally occur at installations that have or had Part A or
Part B RCRA permits to treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. RCRA‟s main objectives
are to protect human health and the environment, conserve energy and natural resources, and
reduce or eliminate the generation of solid and hazardous wastes. Terms, stages and
requirements of RCRA Corrective Action are similar to CERCLA IRP, although specific
requirements at each stage may differ in accordance with RCRA permit requirements. The two
programs, however, are not necessarily mutually exclusive and may overlap.
9.19. Public Affairs Responsibilities.
   9.19.1. General RCRA Community Involvement Requirements. Community involvement
   plays an important role in RCRA permitting, permit modifications, and Corrective Action
   underpermits. The permitting agency, defined as the U.S. EPA or state environmental
   regulators, typically is responsible for community involvement activities during the
   permitting process. However, some public hearing and public notification requirements
   may be placed on the installation by regulation. Where public notice of Corrective Action
   requirements is not occurring under RCRA, the base must assure that the public receive
   adequate notice to satisfy the Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP), 10
232                                            AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   U.S.C. § 2701, et seq., which applies to Corrective Action. Public Affairs should maintain
   contact with the legal office, which can inform them how to satisfy RCRA and DERP
   public notification requirements.
   9.19.2. RCRA Community Involvement Requirements. Specific requirements may be
   obtained from U.S. EPA‟s RCRA Public Participation Manual currently available by writing
   to: RCRA Information Center, U.S. EPA, Office of Solid Waste (5303W), 401 M Street SW,
   Washington DC 20460, calling 1-800-424-9346, or on the Internet at:
   http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/hazwaste/permit/subpart/manual.htm. Also see Figure
   9.5, Environmental Restoration Program Checklist: Public Affairs.

Section 9H—Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and Toxic
Release Inventory (TRI)

9.20. Background. The Emergency Planning and Community-Right-To-Know Act
(EPCRA) was enacted in 1986 to help protect public health and safety from discharges of toxic
substances to the environment by increasing community awareness of chemical hazards and
requiring organizations to account for their specified use of toxic substances. Originally applied
to private industry, EPCRA principles and guidelines were extended to the military by
Executive Order 12856, Federal Compliance with Right-to-Know IAWs and Pollution
Prevention Requirements, 1993. Facility reporting was initiated in 1995.
   9.20.1. Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). If applicable, installations provide a TRI report to
   the U.S. EPA each year that compiles information about toxic releases to the environment and
   transfer of waste to off-site locations.
9.21. Public Affairs Responsibilities. While there is no prescribed way to present
information to the public on toxic releases to the environment, Public Affairs‟ role is to notify
the public of TRI reports and to explain the significance of the data. Notification includes a
public notice explaining EPCRA, an announcement of availability of the report, and
placement of the report at a publicly accessible location, such as the Information Repository.
Information accompanying the report should help the public understand the chemicals and their
related risks, and how the installation uses the hazardous substance. Public Affairs should work
closely with bioenvironmental engineers, the legal advisors, and the environmental managers to
explain the health, safety, and emergency response plans implemented to protect the community
in the case of a chemical mishap. It is also important to communicate to the public that the
military has aggressively sought and implemented pollution prevention measures that has
reduced hazardous waste, and is constantly seeking alternate, less hazardous chemicals.

Section 9I—Other Environmental Programs

9.22. Safe Drinking Water Act. Congress enacted the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) in
1974 to guarantee the safety of public water supplies in the United States. In order to
safeguard drinking water, Congress authorized the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
to put into effect by formal public announcement, health-based standards, called National
Primary Drinking Water Regulations. These are used to regulate public water systems. They
protect public health by regulating the physical, chemical, biological, or radiological
contaminants in drinking water supplies. Owners and/or operators of drinking water supply
systems must notify their customers whenever they fail to comply with certain requirements of
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                              233


these regulations, or when they are operating the drinking water supply system under a
variance or exemption.
   9.22.1. Public Affairs Responsibilities. The SDWA requires operators of public water
   systems to notify users of that system in the event that certain conditions arise that affect
   drinking water safety. The type of notice required under the act depends on the severity of
   the potential violation.
       9.22.1.1. When a public water system fails to comply with an applicable maximum
       contaminant level (MCL), or treatment technique fails to comply with the requirements
       of any schedule prescribed pursuant to a variance or exemption, the public water system
       must give notice to the persons served by the system. This required public notice
       must be by publication in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the area served
       by the system as soon as possible, but in no case later than 14 days after the violation or
       failure. The notice must also be mailed or hand delivered, not later than 45 days after the
       violation or failure. For violations of the MCLs or Maximum Residual Disinfectant
       Levels that may pose an acute risk to human health, the public water system must also
       furnish a copy of the notice to the radio and television stations serving the area served
       by the public water system as soon as possible, but in no case later than 72 hours after
       the violation. The notice must provide a clear and readily understandable explanation of
       the violation, any potential adverse health effects, the population at risk, the steps that the
       public water system is taking to correct such violation, the necessity for seeking
       alternative water supplies, any preventive measures the consumer should take until the
       violation is corrected, and a telephone number as a source of additional information
       concerning the notice. For a more detailed explanation of public notification
       requirements, see 40 C.F.R. 141.32, 141.35.
       9.22.1.2. The U.S. EPA publication, “General Public Notification For Public Water
       Systems,“ can be obtained by contacting the U.S. EPA Safe Drinking Water Act Hot Line
       at 1-800-426-4791 or (202) 382-5533, weekdays between 0830 and 1630 (EST).
   9.22.2. The Environmental Protection Agency requires an annual Consumer Confidence
   Report on the quality of tap water is provided to consumers. This directive applies to
   military bases as well as community drinking water systems. Base Environmental Engineer
   (BEE) is the OPR. Base-level PA needs to assist the base BEE in disseminating information
   to the base and local community.
9.23. Air Installation Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ). Flying operations have an
environmental impact on the community. The goal of the Air Installation Compatible Use
Zone (AICUZ) program is to promote compatible land use development in high noise and
accident potential zones around military installations, to promote public health and safety in
areas adjacent to installations, and to maintain the operational capabilities of the installation.
The program identifies clear zones, accident potential zones, and noise contours, and
recommends land-use guidelines for achieving compatible land use in these areas.
   9.23.1. The base community planner manages the AICUZ program. The planner collects
   and revalidates data, and prepares the AICUZ report or amendment for public release.
   9.23.2. Public Affairs Responsibilities. Usually, the installation commander announces the
   AICUZ program at a public meeting. Public Affairs then releases the AICUZ report, works
234                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   closely with the base community planners and the environmental team to prepare for public
   meetings, and acts as an information conduit between the base and the community.
       9.23.2.1. Public Affairs is involved in the development and release of information
       and must ensure Public Affairs requirements are met by the AICUZ report and any
       changes to it. For additional guidance, Public Affairs should review AICUZ
       Environmental planning bulletins and related information to enhance their knowledge
       of the program and its requirements.
       9.23.2.2. Noise Complaints. In spite of cooperative efforts with the local community
       during the AICUZ process to deter incompatible users from encroaching upon the
       clear zone or accident potential zones (APZs), noise complaints may occur. Public
       Affairs will handle complaints directly and completely without referring callers to other
       bases or commands and without dismissing calls when locally assigned aircraft are not
       involved. To help maintain good media and community relations, Public Affairs will
       provide timely, responsive, and factual answers to aircraft noise complaints. Public
       Affairs usually makes a report of the complaints at the Air Operations Board meeting,
       which is also attended by the community planners. Refer all claims for damages to the
       base claims office.
9.24. Environmental Compliance Assessment and Management Program (ECAMP). T h e
A i r Force‟s ECAMP was designed in response to Executive Order 12088, Federal Compliance
and Pollution Control Standards (13 October 1978), to ensure compliance with all applicable
pollution control standards.
   9.24.1. Discussion. The ECAMP is the Air Force‟s internal, self-assessment program to
   help commanders assess the status of environmental compliance, and to identify
   discrepancies and track solutions.
   9.24.2. Public Affairs Responsibilities. Public Affairs must be aware of ongoing ECAMP
   activities and ensure information is provided to the Air Force internal audience. The Final
   ECAMP Report is made available for release to the public, upon request, following
   MAJCOM approval. Legal reviews will be conducted prior to releasing the final report,
   releasing other documentation or disclosing findings.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         235


                                          Chapter 10

                                    A1R FORCE BANDS

Section 1OA—Purpose and Objectives

10.1. Purpose of Air Force Bands. Air Force bands support the global Air Force mission in
war and peace by providing professional musical products and services for official State
functions and troop morale, military recruiting and civic outreach events.
10.2. Objectives of the Air Force Band Program.
   10.2.1. Build, maintain and strengthen morale, esprit de corps, readiness and retention of
   Air Force people.
   10.2.2. Inspire patriotism, support Air Force recruiting, and encourage young men and
   women to serve in the military.
   10.2.3. Increase public awareness and understanding of the armed forces and the mission,
   policies, and programs of the Air Force.
   10.2.4. Strengthen the reputation of the Air Force as a good neighbor, a respected
   professional organization charged with part of the responsibility for national security.
10.3. General Guidance.
   10.3.1. Program. An Air Force band is a group of professional musicians performing as a
   full-time musical unit. The band commander is the unit commander. Exception: In
   PACAF, the officer assigned to Detachment 1, United States Air Force Band of the Pacific-
   Asia, has command authority over enlisted members at that location. At OL-A, United States
   Air Force Band of the Pacific-Hawaii, command authority is determined by HQ PACAF.
   Table 10.3 shows the locations of the 12 active duty Air Force bands (two premier bands
   and 10 regional bands), their names, sizes, and geographic areas of responsibility (GAR).
   Table 10.4 shows the locations of the 11 Air National Guard (ANG) bands, their names,
   sizes, and geographic areas of responsibility (GAR).
   10.3.2. Primary types of official military functions to be supported are: parades, ceremonies,
   protocol functions, troop morale, retention, recruiting, commander sponsored active duty and
   Reserve Component functions, and Air Force and DOD civic outreach programs that project
   the Air Force image and promote our national heritage.
       10.3.2.1. Civilian sponsored events may be supported. The sponsor may be required to
       reimburse the Air Force for additional expenses. See Chapter 8, Community Relations,
       for additional information.
       10.3.2.2. Air National Guard band operations are directed by respective State Adjutants
       General and are similar to the primary mission of active duty Air Force bands.

Section 1OB—Band Classification and Capabilities

10.4. Classification. Active-duty bands are named units and classified as either premier or
regional bands.
236                                            AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   10.4.1. The United States Air Force Band, Bolling AFB, Washington, D.C., is a
   premier band assigned to the Air Force District of Washington serving the National
   Capitol Region, and national and international needs.
   10.4.2. The United States Air Force Academy Band, Peterson AFB, Colo., is also a
   premier band assigned to Air Force Academy. This band provides musical support to the Air
   Force Academy, has a national mission, and specifically serves its geographic area.
   10.4.3. All other active duty bands are regional bands with assigned GARs. Note: The
   USAF Band of the Pacific is a single regional band divided among three geographically
   separate locations and each operates in a GAR assigned by PACAF. See Table 10.3
   10.4.4. The GAR concept also applies to ANG bands. See Table 10.4, Requests for ANG
   bands to perform outside their GARs must be coordinated through NGB-PA.
10.5. Overall Capabilities. Bands may be subdivided into several smaller autonomous units or
performing groups to satisfy local, MAJCOM, and regional needs. This concept provides the
most cost-effective use of resources. All members may perform together for special concerts,
parades, and other events. Other small elements, such as woodwind and brass ensembles,
choral groups, Dixieland, German, and country-western bands, add to the band‟s overall
capability. Following are examples of units that perform music in support of the band mission:
   10.5.1. Concert Band--Typically composed of 35 to70 members.             Performs concert,
   patriotic, and popular entertainment music.
   10.5.2. Marching or Ceremonial Band--Typically composed of 20 to 90 members. Performs
   military marching and patriotic music.
   10.5.3. Vocal Ensemble--Typically composed of four to 30 members. Performs patriotic and
   popular entertainment music.
   10.5.4. String Ensemble--Typically composed of 15 to 30 members. Performs light classical
   and popular entertainment music.
   10.5.5. Jazz/Dance Band--Typically composed of 16 to 20 members. Performs jazz, dance,
   and popular entertainment music.
      10.5.6. Popular Music Ensemble--Typically composed of three to 10 members. Performs a
      variety of popular music for civic outreach, recruiting concerts, and authorized official
      functions.
      10.5.7. Protocol Combo--Typically composed of three to six members.             Performs
      background and dinner music at authorized official functions.
   10.5.8. Individual Musicians--Perform at military ceremonies and authorized official
   functions.
10.6. Specific Capabilities of Premier, Regional and Air National Guard Bands. DODI
1005.4, Performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner,“ Foreign National Anthems, and “Hail to
the Chief“ by Service Bands, establishes specific military service band responsibilities and
required performance capabilities. Core manning factors listed in Table 10.1 for standard 60-
member regional bands are required to meet DODI 1005.4 guidance, State Funeral and
deployment taskings and to ensure adequate personnel for OCONUS assignment rotation.
Core manning factors for Air National Guard bands are listed in Table 10.2 Band commanders
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                      237


may adjust remaining positions to meet their unit‟s requirements, but are not to exceed the
maximum allowable numbers for any specific shredout as listed in Table 10.1. Names of local
groups may be changed at local discretion. Not all performance units listed below are able to
perform at the same time in different places.
   10.6.1. The United States Air Force Band. Authorized performing units include but are not
   limited to:

       Musicians.

Section 1OC—Operations

10.7. Requesting Band Performances.
   10.7.1. Civilian sponsors must submit a DD Form 2536, Request for Armed Forces
   Participation in Public Events, to the band which serves their geographic area, see Table
   10.3 Military sponsors must submit an official memorandum letter, Figure 10.1, and
   government sponsors must submit an official letter (See Figure 10.2) to the band which
   serves their geographic area.
   10.7.2. Military sponsors requesting performances in support of military events send the
   memorandum letter directly to the band operations director, who coordinates with the Public
   Affairs office on the base where the band is assigned. To protect the integrity of prior
   commitments and maintain an efficient use of limited resources, military sponsors should
   submit their requests at least 60 days in advance for active duty bands and 90 days in
   advance for ANG bands.
238                                               AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   10.7.3. Civilian sponsors may request a band performance by directly contacting the band
   that serves their geographic area or by contacting Public Affairs at the nearest Air Force base.
   Either the band or Public Affairs provides the requester a DD Form 2536 and assists in its
   completion. Send the form to the operations director of the band that serves the requester‟s
   geographic area as listed in Table 10.2 Civilian sponsors should submit their request to the
   band at least 90 days before the event.
   10.7.4. To request an element of The USAF Band, Bolling AFB, Washington, D.C., send a
   completed DD Form 2536 to Air Force District of Washington (AFDWIA-3), Director
   of Operations/Commander of Ceremonies, 20 MacDill Blvd, Suite 100, Bolling AFB
   Washington DC 20032-0201 or fax the completed DD Form 2536 to (202) 767-2801. The
   band must receive request at least 90 days before the event.
   10.7.5. Except for regularly scheduled tours and events within a band‟s local area,
   transportation and funding are the obligation of the requester.
10.8. Geographic Areas of Responsibility (GAR). The most cost-effective use of Air Force
bands is for them to perform within their own GAR. For a list of bands and their GAR, see
Table 10.3 and Table 10.4 When requested to perform outside their GAR, bands must:
      10.8.1. In support of military events, coordinate in advance with the primary band assigned
      to cover the GAR and the next closest band (if applicable).
   10.8.2. In support of civic outreach events, civilian or military sponsored, bands must
   follow guidelines set forth in DODI 5410.19, Public Affairs Community Relations Policy
   Implementation, and confirm that:
         10.8.2.1. No similar military asset local to the event is available to meet the request,
         10.8.2.2. No other military band assets are participating in the event,
         10.8.2.3. All opportunities for local area public concerts within the GAR have been
         met before accepting requests outside the GAR,
         10.8.2.4. No invitations from within the GAR are being declined to allow the unit to
         accept the invitation outside the GAR, and
         10.8.2.5. The itinerary includes a full schedule of performances.
         10.8.2.6. Additional Regional Band Responsibilities. Confirm in writing items 10.8.2.1
         through 10.8.2.5 to the Air Force Bands Division, SAFIPAB, at least 30 days before the
         event along with:
             10.8.2.6.1. Completed DD Form 2536s
             10.8.2.6.2. Sponsors‟ letters of request.
             10.8.2.6.3. An itinerary.
             10.8.2.6.4. A non-availability statement from the primary band assigned to cover the
             GAR.
         10.8.2.7. Additional ANG Band Responsibilities. Confirm in writing items 10.8.2.1
         through 10.8.2.5 to the Chief of ANG Bands, who will coordinate with NGB-PA, at
         least 60 days before the event along with:
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                          239


          10.8.2.7.1. Completed DD Form 2536s for the performances.
          10.8.2.7.2. Sponsors‟ letters of request, if applicable.
          10.8.2.7.3. An itinerary.
          10.8.2.7.4. A non-availability statement from the primary band assigned to cover the
          GAR.
      10.8.2.8. Additional Premier Band Responsibilities. When premier bands are requested
      to perform in a regional band‟s GAR, they must provide courtesy copies of proposed
      itineraries to the regional band and to SAF/PAB at least 30 days in advance.
10.9. Department of Defense Authority. DOD establishes policies for military bands to
perform at certain events, ceremonies, broadcasts, and other activities in the civilian
community, see DOD Directive 5410.18, Public Affairs Community Relations Policy, and DOD
Instruction 5410.19, Public Affairs Community Relations Policy Implementation. Coordinate
with SAF/PAB for DOD approval to participate in:
   10.9.1. Any event in the public domain that results in additional cost to the Air Force.
   10.9.2. Any event where more than one military band is requested to perform.
   10.9.3. Public events in the National Capital Region. Exception: The USAF Band,
   Bolling AFB, Washington, D.C., coordinates with the U.S. Army Military District of
   Washington, Directorate of Special Events and Ceremonies for NCR civic outreach and joint
   service events.
   10.9.4. Events of international or national importance, including national conventions and
   meetings.
   10.9.5. National sports and professional athletic events within the United States.
   10.9.6. National television or radio events and programs.
   10.9.7. Any request made for Outside of the Continental U.S. (OCONUS) travel, except
   Hawaii and Alaska, by military musical units located in the United States and its territories.
10.10. OCONUS Band Requests.
   10.10.1. The Secretary of Defense has given combatant commanders of the combatant
   commands authority to approve overseas public events participation. They may further
   delegate this authority to a subordinate commander. MAJCOMs overseas should follow
   guidance as prescribed in DOD Directive 5410.18 and DOD Instruction 5410.19 as much as
   possible; however, the policy direction and guidance of their combatant command
   headquarters takes precedence. Overseas bands should advise SAF/PAB when they
   participate in any public event, recording, or video project that significantly affects their
   operations or requires major administrative, financial, or logistical support. In general, all
   performances must comply with the criteria for participation in public events outlined in
   Chapter 8 of this publication.
   10.10.2. Military services and subordinate commands located in the United States and its
   territories will refer all requests for OCONUS musical support to the appropriate combatant
   commander or to OASD/PA if the nation to be visited is not assigned to a combatant
   command.
240                                            AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   10.10.3. Requests for OCONUS musical support may be approved only if:
      10.10.3.1. The request is sent to the combatant command or OASD/PA, as appropriate.
      10.10.3.2. The combatant command evaluates the request and, if it meets support
      criteria, tasks in-theater assets. If no in-theater assets are available and the event is
      sufficiently important to warrant support, the combatant commander will forward the
      request, with recommendation, to OASD/PA for evaluation and approval.
      10.10.3.3. OASD/PA evaluates the request and, if approved, forwards it to the
      appropriate military service for action.
   10.10.4. Approval procedure for Air National Guard band OCONUS deployments differs
   from the above only in that combatant commanders submit their requests for NG band
   support through NGB-PA. National Guard Bureau Public Affairs evaluates requests and
   submits its recommended program of band trips to OASD/PA for approval.
   10.10.5. OCONUS tours by U.S.-based musical units will not normally exceed 15 days.
   Tours to single locations will not normally exceed seven days.
   10.10.6. Any situation not covered by the guidance on OCONUS travel of musical units
   stationed in the United States should be immediately brought to the attention of
   OASD/PA/DPCR.
10.11. Legal Restrictions. All band performances must comply with the restrictions and
criteria in section 7.6; DOD Directive 5410.18; DOD Instruction 5410.19; DOD 5500.7-R,
Joint Ethics Regulation, Title 10 of the United States Code (U.S.C.), Sections 8634.
   10.11.1. Rules for Participation in Public Events. The following guidelines apply to all
   public performances and supplement criteria for participation in public events outlined in
   Chapter 8:
      10.11.1.1. Public performances should be scheduled to support Air Force recruiting.
      Bands will coordinate with recruiting service within the GAR when scheduling
      performances.
      10.11.1.2. To make sure band participation in a civic outreach program complies with
      public IAW and DOD policy, see guidelines in Chapter 8 on participation in public
      events or DOD Instruction 5410.19.
      10.11.1.3. Air Force bands may perform short patriotic programs, 5 to 20 minutes, at
      civilian sponsored social, civic, cultural, and athletic events. A patriotic program is one
      that helps a civilian sponsor provide honors to the flag and nation. It consists of patriotic
      or military music, appropriate military honors, and music for presenting the colors. Do
      not play entertainment music such as background, dinner, dance, or other social music.
      10.11.1.4. Air Force bands may play concerts in the traditional setting. Concerts in
      schools and colleges are good for recruiting. Generally, concerts must be free of charge
      and open to the public. However, bands may play fairs, exhibitions, or similar events
      where admission is charged and the band‟s participation is incidental to the primary
      event. No additional charge may be imposed just to hear the band play.
      10.11.1.5. Air Force bands may perform concert tours. These are trips by a band unit to
      give performances in a number of locations, during a specific period, leaving from and
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                          241


     returning to the band‟s home station. Tours are usually paid for with appropriated
     funds. To adequately cover their GAR, bands should budget for and take part in tours.
     See paragraphs 10.11.1.7 and 10.15
     10.11.1.6. Air Force bands may play music for public events and parades sponsored by
     corporate, private or civic entities when the event is of general interest or benefit to a
     local, state, or national community and is open to the entire community. The sponsor‟s
     role must be clearly civic in nature and not political or commercial. Those parades or
     events which are commercially sponsored, designed to increase business traffic, or
     associated with a particular religious or ideological movement (such as a Christmas
     parade, beauty pageant, or political gathering) should not be provided band support.
     10.11.1.7. When a performance is not included in a band‟s regularly scheduled and
     budgeted community relations (COMREL) touring plan, it is the sponsor‟s responsibility
     to absorb costs for performances. These costs normally include, but are not limited to:
     (1) travel and transportation of military personnel; and (2) meals and lodging or per diem
     allowances payable under the provisions of the Joint Travel Regulations.
     10.11.1.8. Air Force bands will comply with current DOD guidance and the Joint Ethics
     Regulation in all matters concerning sponsorship, either corporate or private. Bands may
     receive support from corporate, private or civic entities to defray venue, lodging, meals,
     transportation, and other costs. In exchange, bands may publicly acknowledge the
     sponsor at the concert through remarks, recognition in printed program notes (in a font
     and style that does not attract attention) and/or the display of small pendants or banners
     with the sponsor‟s name. Bands may not refer to sponsor products nor should
     pendants, banners, program notes and advertisements. In addition, Air Force bands will
     not accept the free use of musical instruments, equipment, transportation, or services
     beyond what would normally be needed to accomplish a particular mutual interest
     performance or tour. This includes equipment such as cell phones, computers, etc.; use of
     coaches, trucks or other vehicles, or other transportation in kind (airline or boat passage);
     and services (lodging, long distance phone service, etc.). Acceptance of any such
     products or services for an extended period of time is prohibited. Any exception to this
     policy must be approved by SAF/PA.
  10.11.2. Air Force Band Participation on Military Bases. Air Force bands are authorized and
  encouraged to play music for any active duty or reserve component military organization.
  To maintain an efficient use of limited resources, bands should concentrate their efforts on
  large-scale events (such as wing/squadron picnics, base open houses, dinings-in/dinings-out,
  wing/squadron change of command ceremonies, base retreat ceremonies, etc.) as much as
  possible. These events promote esprit de corps, troop morale and retention and quality of
  life initiatives for military members, their family members and guests. Bands are authorized
  to provide musical support for official DoD functions regardless of the event‟s purpose
  (ceremonial, protocol, troop morale) and other DoD functions where the primary objective is
  to promote the unit‟s esprit de corps, morale, retention or quality of life. Such functions
  include military ceremonies, recreation programs and social events. Reference DoD
  Instruction 5410.19 for definitions of Official Functions. Bands are authorized to support
  the following social functions with background, dinner, entertainment and dance music:
     10.11.2.1. Formal receptions.
242                                          AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


      10.11.2.2. Community relations dinner dances. A high percentage of those attending
      must be civic leaders.
      10.11.2.3. Dinings-in.
      10.11.2.4. Dinings-out.
      10.11.2.5. Bands may play for any of the above events off-base if the sponsor certifies
      that suitable on-base facilities are not available. Reference 10.11.2.10 for sponsor
      qualifications.
      10.11.2.6. Recreational programs. Air Force bands may play for Air Force recreational
      programs. Functions sponsored by clubs that charge dues for membership are not
      approved for band participation, even though these clubs are approved for recreational
      activities.
      10.11.2.7. Air Force ROTC and Junior ROTC events. Bands may support Air Force
      ROTC and Junior ROTC ceremonial events and military balls provided they are held on
      school premises or a military base. These events may be supported off-campus or off-
      base if the ROTC component commander or Professor of Aerospace Science certifies
      on-campus or on-base facilities are not available. These events must be for ROTC
      cadets, faculty members and guests. Band budgeted Operation and Maintenance
      (O&M) funds may be used to pay for band transportation and per diem expenses. If
      O&M funds are unavailable, the ROTC unit must pay for band transportation and per
      diem expenses.
      10.11.2.8. Civil Air Patrol annual ceremonial events may be supported on-base
      provided they have an active duty sponsor. Reference 10.11.2.10 for sponsor
      qualifications.
      10.11.2.9. Air Force bands are authorized to perform in open messes for official DoD
      functions regardless of the event‟s purpose (ceremonial, protocol, troop morale) and for
      other DoD functions where the primary objective is to promote the unit‟s esprit de
      corps, morale, retention or quality of life as certified by the sponsoring official.
      Reference Figure 10.1 Otherwise, Air Force bands are not authorized to perform for
      membership functions in open messes or for other membership association Non-
      Appropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFI). Band members who perform in open
      messes or for other membership association NAFIs while off-duty must perform in
      civilian attire and be paid appropriate compensation for their services from the open
      mess or other NAFI involved.
      10.11.2.10. Sponsor. To request band support, the requester (sponsor) must have the
      authority to approve the expenditure of appropriated funds whether the event is paid
      for by appropriated or non-appropriated means. Examples of authorized sponsors are
      MAJCOM/Group/Wing/Squadron commanders or commander equivalents, directorate
      chiefs, and headquarters staff officials. The sponsor fills out a Memorandum Letter Band
      Request for Military Sponsors, Figure 10.1, certifying criteria about the event‟s purpose
      and location. The sponsor submits the completed memorandum to the band either in
      electronic or printed format. For electronic documents the signature block should
      follow prescribed Air Force guidelines for official electronic documents.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         243


10.12. Off-duty Employment. Public IAW and Joint Ethics Regulations govern off-duty
employment of band members and the use of bands in certain off-base situations.
   10.12.1. U.S.C. Title 10, Section 8634 states “no Air Force band or member thereof may
   receive remuneration for furnishing music outside the limits of an Air Force base in
   competition with local civilian musicians.” This section does not prohibit Air Force
   members from playing off-base on their off-duty time for pay if they are not competing
   with civilian musicians. All off-duty employment must comply with DODD 5500.7,
   Standards of Conduct. Consult the local SJA for additional guidance.
10.13. Recordings. Recordings are authorized and encouraged. They are a cost-effective way
to reach a large audience. Recordings are used for public service broadcasting, recruiting, and
educational activities. All active duty Air Force band recordings will have the following three
disclaimers on the exterior cover: “This compact disc is approved for Department of the Air
Force use and is not for sale.” “Cross Into The Blue” Contact Air Force Recruiting via
http://www.airforce.com/ or call 1-800-423-USAF.” “The USAF is wholeheartedly committed
to reflecting the diversity of our great nation. Individuals from all cultural and ethnic
backgrounds are actively encouraged to learn about the Air Force and seek positions in the
band program. For more information, contact (individual band contact information).” Bands
must send at least three copies of their recordings to SAF/PAB and the National Museum of
the United States Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433, for historical preservation.
Before producing recordings, bands must:
   10.13.1. Budget for the cost of recordings.
   10.13.2. Coordinate with local and MAJCOM PAs.
   10.13.3. Get approval from SAF/PA. Send requests through local and MAJCOM Public
   Affairs to SAF/PAB for final approval. Each request must include the purpose of the
   proposed recording, specific content and overall concept, proposed cover artwork, program
   and booklet liner notes, quantity to be produced, and estimated cost of the entire project.
   Consult SAF/PAB for guidance.
   10.13.4. Air National Guard bands follow a similar procedure except they coordinate
   through their state HQ and the Chief of ANG bands in lieu of MAJCOM PAs and SAF/PAB.
10.14. Monthly Band Reports. Active duty bands submit reports of monthly band
performances electronically to SAF/PAB by the 10th day of each month. In addition, these
bands submit reports of projected (future) performance activities electronically to SAF/PAB by
the 25th of each month. ANG bands submit the same reports quarterly. These reports help HQ
USAF and MAJCOM commanders manage personnel assignments and the use of all Air
Force bands. SAF/PAB publishes a performance tasking order (PTO) that outlines when and
where future band performances take place as well as their target audiences, objectives, tactics,
etc. The PTO is a “living” document updated monthly. Air Force bands are responsible for
scheduling performances to accomplish the objectives outlined in their annual strategic plan.
Bands will use the PTO to forecast their activities and share the information with Air Force
leaders, Public Affairs, and total Air Force recruiting services. SAF/PAB maintains the data
specifications for both the monthly and projected performance reports. SAF/PAB is
responsible for determining if active duty bands are being used effectively through site visits,
analysis of performance statistics, and man-hour utilization data. ANG band utilization is
244                                             AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


evaluated by the Chief of ANG Bands through site visits, analysis of performance data, and
man-hour utilization data. Bands discontinue reporting during MINIMIZE (see glossary) and
emergency conditions.

Section 10D—Funding and Logistics

10.15. Funding. The highest level of command, MAJCOM, NAF, or wing, where a band is
assigned provides funding for the band. A sizable portion of each band‟s operating budget
must include funding for TDY support of military, recruiting and civic outreach events.
Operating costs should be included in the band‟s annual budget submitted to the MAJCOM, NAF
or wing that has administrative and logistical support responsibility for that band. Also reference
paragraph 10.11.1.7 for the sponsor‟s obligations.
10.16. Equipment, Supplies, and Music.
   10.16.1. Procurement. Bands procure equipment, supplies, and music per the Allowance
   Standards AS-600 and applicable procedures described in AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply
   Manual, and AFI64-109, Local Purchase Program. Coordinate requests for additions or
   changes to AS-600 through local supply channels to SAF/PAB. Bands may buy supplies,
   expendable equipment, and music locally.
   10.16.2. Disposal. Before disposing of equipment, supplies, or music, bands should give
   other bands the opportunity to accept them. The band returns excess musical equipment
   purchased with appropriated funds to the equipment management office of the base
   supply facility for redistribution as described in AFMAN 23-110. When a band is
   deactivated, the band commander recommends to SAF/PAB how the band‟s music library,
   instruments, and equipment should be redistributed.
   10.16.3. Maintenance. Sound reinforcement systems, recording systems and individual
   components must be configured and maintained according to manufacturer specifications.
   Band members may perform preventative maintenance and make minor repairs on band
   equipment. Repairs and maintenance they can‟t perform will be done commercially
   through contract maintenance procedures described in AFI 64-102, Operational
   Contracting.
   10.16.4. The United States Air Force Band, Bolling AFB, provides instrumental parts for
   all Air Force bands to the U.S. National Anthem, foreign national anthems, and Hail to the
   Chief. In addition, The USAF Band maintains electronic copies of all anthems for all
   DOD bands and provides music required in the State Funeral plans.
   10.16.5. When band members have a permanent change of station (PCS), their
   performance equipment can be transferred to the gaining unit.
10.17. Band Uniforms. Formal concert and ceremonial uniforms are authorized in AS-016 for
all bands and should be used for all concerts, parades, ceremonies, and official social
functions. Organizational clothing, performance clothing, and accessories will be ordered,
stored, cleaned, and maintained by bands, with the accountability resting with the band. When
band members PCS to another band, performance uniforms used by the gaining unit will go with
the member.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                       245


   10.17.1. Other blazers, tuxedos, and formal attire are included in AS-016 for use by bands
   in appropriate social environments. Special costumes may be used in on-base entertainment
   functions and in connection with off-base recruiting and civic outreach performances when
   such wear would enhance the effectiveness of the program. The ceremonial uniform may
   be worn in any combination equivalent to uniforms authorized in AFI 36-2903, Dress and
   Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel. These uniforms should be worn only at the
   performance and during transport to and from the performance site.
   10.17.2. MAJCOM commanders may authorize band members to wear distinctive uniform
   accessories in addition to uniforms authorized in AS-016 and AFI 36-2903. These are
   decorative items that can be worn temporarily or attached to authorized uniforms in
   connection with official performances. Sewn-on items or other attachments that permanently
   change the basic performance uniform must not be used. Purchase of decorative items with
   military welfare funds is described in AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFS).
   The Supplemental Clothing Allowance for band members is described in AFI 36-3014,
   Clothing Allowances for Air Force Personnel. Rank insignia will be worn as prescribed in
   AFI 36-2903.
10.18. Facilities. The MAJCOM, or state for ANG bands, is responsible for providing housing,
messing, training, welfare, and effective use of band members, see AFI 32-1024, Standard
Facility Requirements. Ensure facilities have appropriate floor plans and room configurations,
rehearsal studio sizes, and acoustical treatment for all performing groups. Rehearsal rooms and
other space must include:
   10.18.1. Acoustically treated rehearsal studios and individual practice rooms. All required
   band units should be able to practice at the same time in separate rehearsal studios.
   Rehearsal rooms should be soundproofed sufficiently so ensembles experience no
   degradation in rehearsal efficiency. SAF/PAB recommends a professional acoustician be
   employed during design or redesign phases of a facility.
   10.18.2. Secured areas for the music library, arranging equipment, musical instruments, and
   supplies.
   10.18.3. Individual lockers, and separate dressing rooms and rest rooms for men and
   women.
   10.18.4. Administrative spaces with separate offices for the commander, deputy
   commander, manager, first sergeant, operations section, and administrative support.
   10.18.5. The minimum space requirements for band facilities are published in AFH 32-1084,
   Facility Requirements:
       10.18.5.1. Eleven-member unit: 11,000 square feet.
       10.18.5.2. Thirty-member unit: 19,000 square feet.
       10.18.5.3. Forty-five to 60-member unit: 25,000 square feet.
       10.18.5.4. The United States Air Force Academy Band: 30,000 square feet.
       10.18.5.5. The United States Air Force Band: 60,000 square feet.
10.19. Vehicles. Bands are authorized vehicles as determined by local needs through their
MAJCOM.
246                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   10.19.1. Minimum requirements for band units by size are:
       10.19.1.1. Eleven-member unit: one truck and two 15-passenger truck carry-alls.
       10.19.1.2. Thirty-member unit: one intercity coach, three trucks, and two 15-
       passenger truck carry-alls.
       10.19.1.3. Forty-five to 60-member unit: two intercity coaches, three trucks, and two
       15-passenger truck carry-alls.
   10.19.2. Bands will be the primary users of these vehicles. Intercity coaches are assigned to
   the vehicle operations branch of the base transportation squadron, with the band as the
   primary user. All band travel requirements should be met before the coaches are used to
   support other authorized activities. When no band requirements exist, coaches may be used
   for other on- or off-base transportation needs. Should a conflict in travel scheduling occur,
   the band commander and vehicle operations officer should jointly determine the type of
   vehicle best suited to support each need.
   10.19.3. When an intercity coach is not available for band use, it is the responsibility of
   the base transportation officer to lease or charter a replacement vehicle with fund cite
   provided by the band, to include commercial charter coaches to meet the band‟s scheduled
   engagements. Since charter contracts usually require a minimum of 24 hours prior
   notice, band coaches should not be used for non-band travel 24 hours before a scheduled
   band trip. This ensures sufficient time to make repairs or obtain a commercial contract for a
   replacement coach if the band coach should develop mechanical problems.
   10.19.4. The band pays TDY expenses for drivers for all band-related travel. Band
   members may drive certain classes of vehicles if trained and certified. Band commanders
   must ensure this does not interfere with rehearsals, performances, or other musical duties and
   crew rest.

Section 10E—Enlistment, Training and Utilization

10.20. Enlistment. Applicants for Air Force bands undergo a pre-screening process which
includes submitting an audio demonstration tape and a brief performance resume to a band or
SAF/PAB. These materials are evaluated and those who pass this pre-screening are invited to
audition in-person. Promising applicants for Air Force regional band positions, AFSC 3N1X1,
are auditioned in-person. An active-duty band officer must approve the live audition.
Applicants for premier band positions, AFSC 3N2X1, are auditioned by the respective band in
a manner determined by the band commander. Applicants for Air National Guard band
positions, AFSC 3N1X1Z, are auditioned in-person by the respective band. The band
commander must hear and approve the live audition. AF Form 485, Application for
Enlistment - U.S. Air Force Band, will be prepared for all qualified applicants according to AFI
36-2002, Regular Air Force and Special Category Accessions. Initial skills training in this
specialty includes the audition process, as conducted by individual band, and mandatory
assignment of entry level personnel to the Basic Military Training School (BMTS) Drum and
Bugle Corps. Air National Guard bands have additional follow-on training as outlined in the
Career Field Education and Training Plan.
10.21. Training. Active-duty and ANG band commanders and the enlisted band leader at HQ
PACAF administer the training programs in AFI 36-2201, V2., Air Force Training Program
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         247


Training Management, primarily through the Career Field Education and Training Plan for the
band career field specialty, AFSC 3N1X1, 3N2X1 and 3N1X1Z. The CFETP provides
information the career field manager, commanders, supervisors, and trainers use to plan,
develop, and conduct an effective career field training program. It outlines training which
individuals must receive to develop and progress through their career.
10.22. Utilization.

 Section 1OG—Band Readiness and Deployment

 10.29. USAF Band Readiness and Deployment Program. Air Force Bands must be ready to
 perform their mission in contingency wartime environments. Deploying Air Force band
 entertainment and ceremonial music provides the commander with operational assets specialized
 to enhance Airman morale and readiness and host nation initiatives.
 10.30. Objective, Scope and Planning.
     10.30.1. Objective. Ensure the band program has the knowledge, training, and equipment to
     conduct its mission in contingency and wartime environments and an understanding of the
     planning and execution process.
     10.30.2. Scope. All bandsmen may be used in AFSCs 3N1X1X and 3N2X1 to meet tasking
     requirements. All military personnel assigned to Air Force Bands are postured on a UTC as
     primary or alternate and should be considered deployable. Wartime duties are the
     same as peacetime duties. Bandsmen should not be tasked to perform non-band duties in
     functional areas other than Air Force Band activities. Failure to comply with this may lead
     to mission failure in either home support or deployment support. Bandsmen must
     perform only assigned musical duties because missions and training require 100 percent of
     assigned positions. They are placed on LBFA series UTCs because of their unique skills.
        10.30.2.1. Wartime duties fall into the following categories: Strategic Mission Support,
        inter-theater deployable, intra-theater deployable, overseas in-place, and CONUS and
        OCONUS home station support and CONUS and OCONUS sustainment. Note: Except
        as determined by SAF/PAB, deployment requirements supersede all other staffing needs.
        10.30.2.2. Bands are identified on standard Air Force Band UTCs. Air Force Band
        UTCs belong in the Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK)
        under the alphanumeric series LBFA. Mission capability statements and manpower
        force element listings for each UTC are contained in the Manpower and Force
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                      257


       Packaging subsystem of the Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging system. A
       logistics detail for each UTC is maintained in the Logistics Force subsystem.
       10.30.2.3. Air Force Band UTCs are fully integrated into the Air Force core UTC
       concept. The core concept unites Air Force weapons systems and the required support
       forces into a single core UTC package.
       10.30.2.4. Augmentation requirements of the active duty force may be supported by
       using ARC personnel through the Military Personnel Appropriation man-day program or
       mobilization.
   10.30.3. Planning. For the Air Force Wartime Planning Process see Chapter 12.3 through
   12.6
       10.30.3.1. Deliberate Planning.    Band readiness planners assigned to theater
       commanders are required to develop OPLANs and Conceptual Plans using standard
       UTCs. Planners use the standardized Band requirements for input into the Time Phased
       Force Deployment databases. Planners also create documented annexes to conceptual
       plans and OPLANs.
10.31. Responsibilities.
   10.31.1. Secretary of the Air Force Public Affairs, Bands Division (SAF/PAB).
       10.31.1.1. Establishes Band doctrine.
       10.31.1.2. OPR for Air Force band deployments.
       10.31.1.3. Performs Air Staff Functional Area Manager (FAM) duties.
       10.31.1.4. Coordinates on all operation plans (OPLANs) with Headquarters Air Force
       Director of Plans and Operations to maintain continuity in band planning.
       10.31.1.5. Is responsible for Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System
       (MEFPAK) command and MEFPAK Functional Area Manager (MEFPAK FAM) as well
       as LOGDET.
       10.31.1.6. Is MEFPAK Band FAM with planning responsibilities to include OPLAN
       requirements and unit type code (UTC) sourcing.
   10.31.2. Unit Commander.
       10.31.2.1. Ensures unit manning, equipment and training meet all requirements.
       10.31.2.2. Ensures Unit Deployment Managers (UDMs) are trained and execute
       programs per MEFPAK FAM guidance.
       10.31.2.3. Establishes   programs   to   ensure   members      understand   deployment
       responsibilities.

      10.31.3.3. Maintains required uniform items, personal clothing and hygiene items
      according to MAJCOM/AOR/Wing requirements.
10.32. Training.
   10.32.1. General. All Band musicians will be available to undergo deployment training to
   meet mission requirements.
   10.32.2. Air Force Band personnel assigned to a UTC will receive training in accordance
   with AFI10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution. Training will be accomplished on
   an as-needed basis and may be composed of computer-based training, self-study guides,
   classroom education, hands-on equipment training, and ancillary training such as weapons
   qualification, Nuclear, Biological and Chemical warfare training, and Self-Aid Buddy Care.
   10.32.3. The following policy provides the road map for complying with the CSAF vision
   and guidance contained in AFI 10-400, Aerospace Expeditionary Force Planning. This
   guidance is to be used until the release of updated regulations.
      10.32.3.1. Bands will comply with local training requirements for all members
      assigned to deployable UTCs. Specific UTC assignment will be determined by the Band
      Manager.
      10.32.3.2. Individuals assigned to UTCs postured to support the 10 AEFs will be
      scheduled for training on a rotational basis, the same as AEF scheduled UTCs. The
      Band Manager will determine final training requirements and ensure that members have
      all locally required training.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           259


      10.32.3.3. Members assigned to UTCs will be scheduled to attend training using the
      “team training” concept. A timeline will be coordinated with band training managers to
      ensure full implementation of any new, revised, and recurring training.
10.33. Concept of Operations.
   10.33.1. Air Force Bands will be able to deploy in support of component commander‟s
   troop morale and host nation initiatives in coordination with the assigned Air Force Services
   commander.
   10.33.2. SAF/PAB will appoint an Air Force Bandsman with band operational experience
   to deploy to the AOR and report to the AF Services commander. This Bandsman will be
   the Band ADVON (advanced echelon) Specialist. His or her purpose is to plan and execute a
   band deployment within the AOR. The Band ADVON Specialist will deploy 10-30 days
   prior to an ensemble‟s deployment.
   10.33.3. Band Deployments will routinely use DOD and AF Services Entertainment Circuits
   and will work closely with the Entertainment Circuit Manager. The combatant commander,
   AF Services Commander and Entertainment Circuit Manager will determine specific
   entertainment needs for a cycle, which will generally be planned one cycle ahead of actual
   deployment. This allows for adequate customization of the deployable ensemble by the
   tasked unit.
   10.33.4. The Band ADVON Specialist will plan the arrival, air transportation, performance
   schedules and locations, in-country travel arrangements, bed down, and communications
   support for the deploying ensemble. Member will coordinate with the AOR commander and
   AOR Services commander to ensure support is available for band missions tasked to
   support troop morale and host nation programs. The Band ADVON Specialist will also
   coordinate with and inform Public Affairs personnel of troop morale and host nation events.
   During deployment of ensembles, the Band ADVON Specialist will continue to manage all
   aspects of the deployment.
   10.33.5. Bands will deploy from their home station on a date specified by the Band ADVON
   Specialist and report as directed. Band support will normally be utilized in periods of up to 21
   days. Deployments of longer duration in the same AOR should be avoided because they
   may reduce morale and readiness effects by performing for the same audience numerous
   times.
   10.33.6. Bands will normally deploy during the middle periods of the AEF Cycle,
   between days 40-70. This will maximize impact when Airman morale is typically lowest
   and will reduce the logistical burden on airlift during peak rotation periods. Specific dates
   will be determined by the Band ADVON Specialist in coordination with Services personnel
   to meet specific mission requirements of the AOR commander.
   10.33.7. After the completion of a deployment each ensemble will return to the home station
   and the Band ADVON Specialist will remain to make arrangements for the next cycle,
   including the determination of ensemble requirements.
   10.33.8. Upon completion of arrangements for the next AEF cycle, the Band ADVON
   Specialist will return to their home station. They will brief the next Band ADVON
   Specialist, which may require a TDY. This completes one deployment cycle.

   10.33.9. Unit deployment nominations and assignments will be managed by the Air Staff
   and MEFPAK FAMs, in consultation with the AEF Public Affairs Scheduler and individual
   band managers.
10.34. Equipment and Supplies.
   10.34.1. Deployment Equipment Requirements. Air Force Band Deployment UTCs
   must be equipped and deploy with team kits as listed in the logistics detail and team
   members issued individual deployment bags.
   10.34.2. The M-9 is the primary weapon for all Bandsmen (officer and enlisted).
   Bandsmen will be trained accordingly. The M-16 may be required for some situations
   and will be assigned on an as-required basis.
   10.34.3. Deployment Preparation. Air Force Band Deployment teams will prepare and
   deploy IAW AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution, and locally defined
   installation deployment guidance. Bands must provide input to local deployment guidance.
   Ensure deployment guidance meets requirements for other base agencies and/or bands to
   procure, store, maintain, and issue deployment bags, body armor, and weapons, as necessary,
   to meet deployment commitments.
10.35. Fund Sources.
   10.35.1. Air Force Band deployments are funded through appropriated funds and coded
   with an applicable emergency and special programs (ESP) code.

   the outlets services. AFRTS outlets should be included in Public Affairs instructions and
   annexes to base operations plans. Detachment chiefs/commanders must review applicable
   documents annually and coordinate with Public Affairs.

Section 11C—Programming and Other Requirements

11.11. AFRTS Programming. AFRTS provides multiple channels of TV and radio
programming by satellite to manned and unmanned AFRTS outlets around the world. Full-
service TV channels with entertainment, news, and sports are available for both the Atlantic
and Pacific theaters. Additional services provide news and sports and more entertainment
programming.
   11.11.1. AFRTS programming must be aired on a dedicated channel, it will not “share” a
   channel with other program services.
   11.11.2. In areas where AFRTS outlets have one TV broadcast frequency, or only one
   channel on a base cable system, the theater-specific full-service channel will be provided.
   Manned outlets will produce and insert local command information, to include news,
   information spots, and special and emergency announcements. Outlets will provide local
   information on as many TV and radio cable services as resources allow. Manned outlets do
   not create independent broadcast schedules by recording programs or switching between
   AFRTS channels.
   11.11.3. When an installation‟s cable system is limited by the number of channels it can
   distribute, the installation commander may choose which channels to distribute.
   11.11.4. A 1-volt peak-to-peak National Television System Committee (NTSC) video
   and/or 4-volt audio signal will be made available to the base cable system at the AFRTS
   facility.
11.12. Priorities for Capabifity to Insert Locaf Information on AFRTS Services.
   11.12.1. Local news, information spots, and emergency announcements on radio and TV
   broadcast channels and/or primary services on cable systems. The primary TV service is
266                                             AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   that theater‟s full service channel, for radio it is whatever service carries local disk jockey
   (DJ) shows.
   11.12.2. Emergency announcements on all AFRTS channels.
   11.12.3. Automated insertion of local information spots and news on all AFRTS channels.
11.13. Subdued Programming. Stations must be sensitive to significant worldwide or local
events. The local Public Affairs officer and U.S. country team determine the need for subdued
programming. Mirroring local broadcasts is usually preferred, but variations in local program
materials and network source will affect station‟s abilities to do that.
   11.13.1. Establish and coordinate procedures in advance to verify and implement subdued
   or modified program schedules. Report implementation of subdued programming, or in
   extreme cases, host country team decision to take the station off the air, immediately to
   AFNEWS/BGO.
11.14. Spot Availabilities. AFRTS airs DOD internal information on all program services.
Specific availabilities, along with cues to trigger automation systems, are provided for theater
and local spot insertion. Local information will be inserted at those cued opportunities, or
crawled across the bottom third of the screen.
11.15. Local Publicity. Specific guidance on types of spot announcements which can be
produced and aired by AFRTS outlets is provided in DOD 5120.20-R. The goal is not to endorse
any commercial organizations or brands, but rather to provide information of importance and
interest to authorized audience members.
   11.15.1. Local publicity is provided to groups and organizations authorized and recognized
   by customer commands/bases. All information must be targeted at authorized audience
   members: overseas DOD personnel and their family members.
   11.15.2. The installation chaplain is the approving authority for publicity of any local
   religious activities.
   11.15.3. Unofficial private organizations on-base must be registered with Services to
   receive publicity. Stations must get a current listing of approved private organizations from
   Services.
   11.15.4. Publicity for off-base or host nation activities should be limited to events of cultural
   interest to audience members and must be approved by Public Affairs.
11.16. Local Production Criteria/Plan. Detachment chiefs/commanders must ensure a
documented plan is in effect for prioritizing local production efforts. The plan must be
based on local command/ host-base goals and objectives. Additionally, AFNEWS outlets must
concentrate spot production efforts on local information. Setting, talent, and personalities alone
do not satisfy this requirement; the information presented must be unique to local viewers
11.17. Airing Non-AFRTS Produced Spots. Stations may air spots provided by other theater
resources when they meet all criteria for local production.
      11.17.1. Stations request Air Force unique spot and program clearance from AFNEWS
   11.17.2. Clearance to air spots from all other outside agencies must be requested from
   AFRTS/RTPO.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                          267


11.18. Documentation. All requests for publicity (whether used as reader or produced
element), along with scripts/copy and a record of airings will be retained for 90 days. When
requests are not honored, the customer will be contacted and a record of disapproval will be
kept for 90 days. Retain news copy and alibi tapes for all local productions at least 30 days.
Keep morgue copies of news inserts indefinitely as space allows.
11.19. Airing Local 1nformation. Concentrate efforts on airing local internal information
(to include sports and weather.). Accomplish this by producing and re-airing local inserts such as
community bulletin boards, character generated productions on TV, reader updates and
produced spots on radio, local newsbreaks, etc. (Meet this requirement on all radio and/or
television services.) Where the technical ability to meet any internal information requirement
does not exist, detachment chiefs must identify the shortcoming to AFNEWS.
   11.19.1. Present local internal information and weather in all local radio DJ programs,
   newscasts, and newsbreaks and at every opportunity in network-delivered radio and TV
   programming, with emphasis on times of greatest listening/viewing. Target local information
   appropriately (i.e., spots aimed at children air during children‟s programming.)
11.20. Production Standards.
   11.20.1. Slates. Air Force Broadcasting Service archived or exported analog videotapes must
   contain at least 30 seconds color bars and tone for video productions, 30 seconds tone for
   audio, and a slate for both audio and video productions. Slate will include title, run time,
   production and air dates, producer, and location produced. Exceptions are permitted where
   other requirements exist (i.e., contest entries).
   11.20.2. Content. Detachment chiefs and RNC directors are responsible for the content of
   all local productions. They must establish procedures to ensure products have accurate,
   appropriate treatments and meet technical standards.
   11.20.3. Lengths. Establish uniform lengths for all spots to facilitate automation systems.
   No spots will be longer than one minute.
   11.20.4. Required Notices. Before recording an interview, tell the interviewee on tape the
   purpose and intended use of the interview and the interviewer‟s rank, name, and
   organization. Insure the interviewee knows they are being recorded for broadcast. Hold
   the master tape for at least 48 hours after the interview is broadcast.
   11.20.5. Announcer Identification. Unless prohibited by host country, radio and television
   announcers must identify themselves using rank and name at the beginning of each local
   program or live radio hour. Rank may be dropped at other times. Set a consistent policy
   for how service ranks are used on-air. Detachment chiefs/commanders will approve
   nicknames or stage names.
   11.20.6. Breakaways. Lockouts for radio and television news stories will conform to the
   customer‟s requirements. Detachment Chiefs/RNC Directors will set a consistent policy for
   local products.
   11.20.7. Errors In Fact. Correct significant errors in fact clearly and promptly. Do this at
   the next broadcast opportunity. At minimum, correct an error in a specific product
   (newscast, bulletin board, live show) in the next airing of that same program/production.
268                                             AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   11.20.8. Editorializing. Do not express editorial or personal viewpoints in news and internal
   information Public Affairs broadcasts. This does not preclude comments normally made to
   provide color to local sports or recreational events coverage.
   11.20.9. Stock Footage. Stock video and/or historical file footage used within a news story
   must be identified as such.
   11.20.10. Manipulation. Do not report inaccurate or misleading information. Report any
   attempts at manipulation or interference with free flow of information immediately to
   AFNEWS/BGO.
11.21. Routine, Special and Emergency Announcements. AFRTS outlets must document
processing procedures for routine, special, and emergency announcements. Include day
and time requests are received, authenticated and aired.
   11.21.1. Routine announcements are received in writing in advance of the requested air
   date. Establish procedures to ensure announcements are ready to air by the first appropriate
   air date. Air routine announcements in normal, appropriate, spot rotations.
   11.21.2. Special announcements are short-notice announcements that affect a large
   portion of the audience. Since they often cannot be received in writing, establish
   procedures to authenticate the caller and information. Air these announcements as soon as
   possible in normal spot positions, but no later than 20 minutes after receipt (when
   appropriate). Appropriate topics include Red Cross personnel announcements, inclement
   weather advisories, flight arrivals, and schedule changes.
   11.21.3. Emergency announcements require immediate processing.                     Air these
   announcements on all broadcast services. Establish procedures to limit who may
   authenticate emergency announcements. Break into programming for bulletins such as
   natural disaster instructions, severe weather warnings and real-life military alert conditions
   or life-threatening situations.
11.22. AFRTS Service Outages and Restoral Priority. Publicize scheduled outages on all
services. Explain the reason for and expected duration of the service interruption.
   11.22.1. Report unscheduled outages of more than one hour immediately to
   AFNEWS/BG/BGO/ BGL. Report all outages in the monthly status report.
   11.22.2. Host nation sensitivities permitting, submit appropriate information to the
   installation bulletin and newspaper for publication before scheduled outages. Brief
   customer commanders as soon as possible. Hold the master media (audio or videotape or
   digital file) for at least 48 hours after the interview is broadcast.
   11.22.3. Explore alternatives to complete outages before taking a station completely off the
   air.
   11.22.4. Establish procedures and train all broadcast and maintenance personnel to restore
   minimal service. Establish procedures to report equipment malfunctions. Develop guidance
   for “off-air“ disclaimers. Provide and document training upon arrival and every six months.
      11.22.5. AFNEWS/BG restoral priorities are:
         11.22.5.1. Priority One: primary (broadcast) radio service (the service where live radio
         shows are produced/performed).
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                        269


      11.22.5.2. Priority Two: primary TV service (where service exists over the air and on
      cable, the theater entertainment channel is considered the primary TV service).
      11.22.5.3. Priority Three: secondary radio service(s).
      11.22.5.4. Priority Four: secondary TV service(s).
11.23. General Guidelines.
   11.23.1. Reporting Requirements. Stories sent to AFNEWS. Notify AFNEWS by e-mail
   when stories are mailed or called into Air Force Radio or Television News. This allows
   AFNEWS to confirm products are received, and provides a point-of-contact if there are
   problems.
   11.23.2. Distinguished Visitor Reporting. Retain air-check copies of all radio and TV
   materials which include Department of Defense officials, Secretaries and Under-Secretaries
   of Military Departments, Chiefs of Staff, Vice Chiefs of Staff, or senior enlisted leadership
   (e.g. Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force) for 90 days. Send e-mail detailing who
   appeared, date produced, and date aired (or scheduled air date) to AFNEWS/BGO and
   AFNEWS, within 24 hours of production. Advise of all other out-of-theater Distinguished
   Visitor visits and broadcast coverage.
   11.23.3. Broadcast Materials Inventory. AFRTS outlets must keep an accurate listing of
   radio broadcast and production library materials. Conduct inventory of all radio materials
   annually and report results to AFNEWS/BGOO by 1 March.
   11.23.4. Professional Library. Maintain a permanent broadcast reference library. Use for
   local training and product quality assessment. Library materials, whether obtained from
   the base library, AFNEWS/BG, or other sources are accountable materials. Establish a
   publications listing and inventory annually.
   11.23.5. Disposition Requests. All requests for disposition of AFRTS library materials must
   be sent to AFNEWS/BGOO. Routine disposition of regular program shipments will be
   sent directly to AFRTS-BC/DOPR or DOPT.
   11.23.6. Continuity. Outlets and RNCs must maintain continuity books on key processes
   (flow charts with “how to“ details, production notebooks for each regular program, tutorials
   on equipment). Books should enable any unit member to step in and accomplish key
   processes when needed.
      11.23.6.1. At AFRTS outlets, provide routine and emergency quick reference guidance in
      TV and radio master control rooms. Include applicable instructions, step-by-step
      procedures to cover routine and non-routine actions (i.e. step-by-step instructions,
      emergency phone numbers, procedures for Red Cross notifications, bomb threats, and off-
      air conditions). Everything an operator needs to know to perform on-air or emergency
      duties must be instantly available.
   11.23.7. Applicable Publications. All AFRTS operations personnel must be familiar with
   the contents and requirements of DODD 5120.20 and DOD 5120.20-R.
   11.23.8. Broadcast Logs. AFRTS outlets prepare a daily radio broadcast log for all local
   programming before the programming day starts. Logs must be reviewed by station
270                                              AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   management daily. Retain radio program logs, and all radio and TV automation system as-
   run logs for a minimum of 30 days.
  11.23.9. Product Quality Assessment (PQA). Outlets and RNCs must establish an effective
  PQA program. The goal of PQA is process improvement. Use PQA to ensure quality of
  products, identify training requirements, and ensure customer satisfaction. Specific
  guidance will be provided by AFNEWS/BG.
  11.23.10. Surveys. AFRTS outlets shall conduct local audience surveys in accordance
  with DOD 5120.20-R. AFRTS conducts world-wide surveys of audience viewing
  preferences, local surveys should concentrate on products the outlet controls such as local
  news and radio DJ shows. Send copies of formal survey instruments to AFNEWS/BGO at
  least 10 days prior to duplication and distribution. Provide copies of survey findings to
  AFNEWS/BGO, AFRTS, and AFRTS-BC.
   11.23.11. Station Identification. AFRTS outlets air station identifications in accordance
   with host country requirements (usually found in broadcast approval documents) and DOD
   5120.20-R.
   11.23.12. Network Imaging. Manned AFRTS outlets will blend their image with that of the
   network. Legal IDs for each outlet generally include the network and location. Deviations
   from that must be approved by AFNEWS/BGO.
      11.23.13. Contests. AFRTS outlets are encouraged to conduct contests in conjunction with
      Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) and Services (such as trivia contests) during
      local radio shows. Contests are a great way to generate interest in local shows and publicize
      local activities. Outlet members and their families are prohibited from participating in all
      such contests.
   11.23.14. Time Sensitive News Shipment. Timely TV news stories sent to service news
   organizations, such as Air Force Television News, must arrive before the production
   deadline or the time and effort spent producing them is wasted. Use of express mail or
   other overnight delivery services is authorized for time sensitive products.
      11.23.15. Restrictions On Use of AFNEWS/BG Personnel and Equipment. Use of
      AFNEWS/BG personnel and equipment is limited to broadcast products described in this
      instruction. They do not produce training or orientation tapes or conduct audiovisual
      documentation.
      11.23.16. Releasing Copies of Local Productions.
         11.23.16.1. Public Affairs is the sole releasing authority for news and information about
         Air Force activities. Refer requests for copies of local productions from people and
         agencies outside the Air Force to Public Affairs in accordance with DOD 5120.20-R.
         11.23.16.2. AFNEWS/BG outlets and RNCs do not provide copies of local productions
         for private use.
         11.23.16.3. AFNEWS/BG outlets and RNCs provide copies of local productions to
         Air Force units only when there is a valid operational requirement. This is generally the
         completed production, not raw footage. Exceptions would be situations such as
         accident investigations where the unedited footage meets a legitimate need. Requesting
         organizations are encouraged to record productions off the air or base cable systems.

                                          Chapter 12

                                  WARTIME READINESS

Section 12A—Purpose, Objectives and Planning Process

12.1. Purpose of Public Affairs Readiness. Public Affairs Airmen must be ready to perform
their expeditionary mission in contingency and wartime environments. PA Airmen apply their
core competencies of trusted counsel to leaders, airmen morale and readiness, public trust and
support, and global influence and deterrence to deliver strategic, mission-enabling effects for
Air Force and joint warfighters. Public affairs operations in times of contingency and combat
must be focused on direct support of priority strategic objectives set forth by national leaders
and military commanders. All actions in times of crisis and combat are measured by their
contributions to the strategic objectives of the supported combatant commander. The
fundamental strategies at the heart of America‟s military superiority must be applied to public
affairs planning and operations across the spectrum of conflict. These include: disciplined
planning and execution; robust and realistic training; integration of diverse units and
capabilities for synergistic effects; seizing the initiative; professional risk management; real-
time communication for reduced decision cycles; endless loop planning processes; robust and
responsive command and control; and precision strike. Public Affairs Airmen must understand
these transformational approaches to modern warfare and apply them to PA planning and
operations across the spectrum of conflict.
12.2. Objectives of Wartime Readiness Program.
   12.2.1. Ensure Public Affairs has the knowledge, training and equipment to conduct its
   mission in contingency and wartime environments.
   12.2.2. Provide Public Affairs with a basic understanding of the wartime planning process.
   12.2.3. Define Public Affairs‟ role in Contingency and Information Operations.
12.3. Air Force Wartime Planning Process. Air Force deliberate planning begins when the
President issues the annual National Security Strategy of the United States.
   12.3.1. The National Security Strategy is translated into the National Military Strategy.
   12.3.2. The Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP), matches up the National Military
   Strategy and the forces needed to meet that requirement. The JSCP also outlines
   Information Flexible Deterrent Options such as the ones listed below.
       12.3.2.1. Maintain an open dialog with the news media.
       12.3.2.2. Heighten international awareness of the potential for conflict.
       12.3.2.3. Promote U.S. national (and/or coalition) objectives for the operation.
       12.3.2.4. Combat enemy disinformation.
       12.3.2.5. Gain and maintain support through public involvement in the operation.
       12.3.2.6. Keep the operation in the public mind past the first wave of coverage.
272                                            AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   12.3.3. Each combatant command, such as U.S. Central Command or U.S. European
   Command, generates Operation Plans (OPLANS) based on the assumptions of the JSCP, the
   combatant commander‟s strategic concept, and a coordinated movement schedule for getting
   forces to the theater. Crisis action planning is driven by specific events and the process is a
   compression of the deliberate process.
12.4. Deliberate Planning. Occurs before a plan is needed for execution and is developed from
assumptions provided by a higher authority. The resulting plan identifies tactics, equipment,
training needs and support requirements for successful execution. Budget, force sizing and
equipment design decisions are based on deliberate plans.
12.5. Crisis Action Planning. In crisis action planning, either a deliberate plan is tailored to
meet existing operational requirements or a new plan is developed based on mission
requirements and available resources.
12.6. Public Affairs Planning Process. Air Force Public Affairs‟ role in the process begins
when the combatant commands issue their OPLANS.
   12.6.1. SAF/PA Responsibilities: SAF/PAR reviews and coordinates on all OPLANS
   received by the Air Staff for review. SAF/PAR will ensure that OPLAN taskings can be met
   by force providers. SAF/ PAR will manage all FOA/DRU assets that are not managed by
   a MAJCOM to include posturing those authorizations for the Air Staff, FOA, and DRU
   assets in the Air Force-wide UTC Taskings Availability Summary (AFWUS) and the
   AEF time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD) libraries. SAF/PAR will monitor
   ART reporting for all XFFG and LBFA series UTCs to ensure compliance with reporting
   guidance. SAF/PAR will develop policy and guidance that supplement this instruction as
   needed. SAF/PAR is responsible for organizing annual sourcing conferences. FAMs at the
   MAJCOM and numbered AF level must attend the sourcing conference.
   12.6.2. Air Component Responsibilities. The combatant command‟s air component PAs,
   such as U.S. Central Command Air Forces Public Affairs (USCENTAF/PA), builds Public
   Affairs requirements in support of the combatant command OPLAN, usually titled Annex F.
   As part of this responsibility, the air component PA also establishes the associated PA
   deployment requirements within an OPLAN TPFDD. These two products--the Annex F
   and the OPLAN TPFDD--define what PA will do to support OPLAN objectives and how
   many PA manpower authorizations (PA, Bands and Broadcasters) are required to support
   the OPLAN. Annex F does not eliminate the need for a strategic communication plan and
   other more robust and deliberate PA planning and command and control products. It does,
   however, define initial PA planning guidance for the supporting components and Services.
   Air component PAs must consult the AEF library prior to building requirements to ensure
   forces will be available.
   12.6.3. MAJCOM Responsibilities. As a Management Headquarters function,
   MAJCOMs are required to organize, train and equip PA units within their commands in
   order to provide ready PA forces to meet DOD and combatant command requirements in
   support of crisis or deliberate plans. This includes posturing all military authorizations and
   deployment eligible positions within a MAJCOM against unit type codes (UTCs) and
   loading them into the AFWUS and the AEF TPFDD libraries. Only authorizations on the
   MAJCOM “out” list are exempt from being postured. These two products are used by air
   component planners and the AEF Center to determine which forces are available to meet
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                      273


  worldwide deployment requirements. MAJCOMS must ensure all their postured members
  are aware of their AEF on call period. MAJCOMs are also responsible for ensuring that all
  UTCs assigned to their command are continually updated in the AEF Reporting Tool
  (ART) database and any change is reflected in ART within 48 hours. MAJCOMS must
  make sure all units are reporting within the established guidelines for ART. This system,
  managed by the AEF Center and MAJCOMs, allows commanders and air component
  planners to evaluate available deployment capability. The intent of all these actions is
  clear: every deployment-eligible PA within each MAJCOM will know what AEF they are
  assigned to and when they‟re eligible to deploy.
     12.6.3.1. Wing Responsibilities. Wing PA chiefs or units with deployment-eligible PA
     forces will ensure the acquisition and/or purchase of all deployment equipment required
     to meet a unit‟s specific UTC requirements. Each unit must equip to the total number of
     UTCs it has tasked on-call at any one time during an AEF pair. Specific equipment
     requirements are listed in the UTC logistics detail (LOGDET). Wing PA chiefs and units
     with deployment-eligible PA forces are also required to ensure all deployment-eligible
     unit members are assigned to an AEF and regularly report UTC status within the AEF
     Reporting Tool (ART) system IAW AFI 10-244, Reporting Status of Aerospace
     Expeditionary Forces. Changes in a UTC status must be reported within 48 hours of
     the change in status.
  12.6.4. Secure Communications. MAJCOM PA offices will have secure communications
  capabilities, both computers and telephones, readily available for PA Airmen and civilians
  with PA planning and coordination responsibilities. Improper handling of classified and
  sensitive information can compromise operations and risk lives and will always erode the
  confidence and trust of commanders and supported Airmen. MAJCOMs and other PA
  offices that have contingency and combat planning responsibilities should be equipped to
  make secure communications equally as convenient as unsecure comm.
  12.6.5. Unit Type Codes. Public Affairs manpower and equipment assets are tasked for
  wartime and contingency requirements under several specific unit type codes (UTCs).
  The UTC is a five-digit alphanumeric designator used to identify specific capabilities,
  skill levels or skill level packages needed to support a beddown location or deployment
  requirement. Each UTC has three parts that describe what‟s needed to make it fully
  operational: a mission capability (MISCAP) description, associated manpower force
  packaging system (MANFOR) requirements and the associated logistics requirements.
  12.6.6. Taskings by UTC. Under the AEF concept, PA deployment taskings originate within
  a combatant command and the air component PA. They flow to the AEF center, which
  selects UTCs from the AEF TPFDD libraries. Those requirements flow from the AEF
  Center to the MAJCOM in which the UTC resides. MAJCOM/PA AEF Functional Area
  Managers (FAMs) should have visibility on all PA deployment requirements coming into
  their command. Once the MAJCOM PA FAM has verified through appropriate channels
  that the tasked UTC is able to meet the deployment requirement, the AEF Center flows
  the official tasking through command channels to the unit‟s Military Personnel Flight.
  Deploying and redeploying PA Airmen should report the status of their travels at each key
  milestone to gaining and losing PA offices as they travel to and from an AOR. This ensures
  the Air Force maintains positive control of its most valuable resource, Airmen, and helps PA
274                                             AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


    functional area managers and planners accurately monitor PA capability levels. For complete
    details on the AEF UTC tasking process, see AFI 10-400.
        12.6.6.1. PA Specific UTCs. PA UTCs are built based on authorizations on the Unit
        Manning Document. UTCs are not built for overage positions. The specific
        definition of PA UTCs are listed in the Air Staff Sourcing and Coding Guidance posted
        on the AEF Center website. at https://aefcenter.acc.af.mil/. SAF/PAR is the pilot unit
        for all XFFG and LBFA series UTCs.
        12.6.6.2. Equipment Packages. Public Affairs equipment is required under the
        logistics detail (L0GDET) for LBFA series UTCs. The XFFG series UTCs may or may
        not have a L0GDET, for the most part, XFFG UTCs are manpower only UTCs.
        Equipment requirements are outlined in the M1SCAP for XFFG series UTCs. Units with
        a wartime or contingency tasking under these UTCs must have the equipment on-hand,
        as described in the M1SCAP for the UTC, and ready to deploy. Typically, equipment
        requirements are one laptop and digital camera for each UTC in a given pair.

Section 12B—Roles and Missions

12.7. Roles and Missions. The Air Force conducts Public Affairs operations to communicate
truthfully unclassified information about Air Force activities to Air Force, domestic, and
international audiences. Public Affairs operations use timely and accurate information to help
deter war, drive a crisis back to peace, or wage war. The global information environment and
geo-political trends make public affairs operations, media coverage and public opinion vital
elements of modern military strategy. Enormous strategic implications hang in the balance.
Effective public affairs operations can have enormous strategic and enabling effects, including
but not limited to:
- Gain, sustain and enhance domestic and international support for the operation
- Nurture and enhance the morale and commitment of coalition forces and families
- Sustain and enhance coalition solidarity and resolve
- Counter enemy efforts to broaden opposition by highlighting American resolve and capability
- Nurture and enhance the trust and confidence of key coalition partners providing theater access
for expeditionary operations.
- Preempt and counter enemy propaganda to sustain freedom of movement and initiative
12.8. 1nformation Operations. Joint Publication 3-13, Joint Doctrine for Information
Operations defines information operations as actions taken to affect adversary information and
information systems while defending one‟s own information and information systems. Public
Affairs operations have a great impact on friends and foes and may be supported by, or support
10 missions, as detailed in AFDD 2-5.3, Public Affairs Operations.While policy, precedent,
integrity and good strategy all bar PA from intentionally misleading the American public or
elected leaders, coordination with 10 planners helps eliminate the possibility of PA
unintentionally misleading the public or compromising operational security or legitimate
deception campaigns. PA actions in the past conflicts have shown that strategic and active
release of truthful information can be one of America‟s most valuable military weapons. A
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                       275


unified effort between PA and 10 planners is vital to ensuring PA capabilities are most
effectively and credibly employed while other information operations deliver maximum
intended effects. Various PA tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that have proven
successful in the organization, planning and execution of PA and other information operations
are detailed in Air Force TTP 3-1, Vol 36, Tactical Employment: Information Warfare, available
only on S1PRNET, and Air Force 0perational TTP 2-3.2, Air and Space Operations Center.
   12.8.1. Public Affairs tactics reside in the influence operations sphere of 10 and provide
   the commander with effective means to maintain legitimacy and counter adversary
   propaganda through the timely release of accurate information through public
   communication channels. PA operations support the 10 effort by gathering information,
   analyzing that information and developing/executing courses of action in accordance with
   DOD guidance and the combatant commander‟s stated objectives.
   12.8.2. PA planners will integrate with 1O organizations at the appropriate levels. PA
   coordination with 1O organizations does not cede control of PA operations to the 1O
   community, but provides opportunities for PA to support the commander‟s operational
   objectives through centralized control and decentralized execution of all information
   operations. Public Affairs and 1O planners for PSYOPS, Military Deception and Civil
   Affairs (when in use) should coordinate their actions/information products to prevent
   counteracting each other or compromising operational security.
   12.8.3. Public Affairs operations can counter hostile PSYOP or complement friendly
   PSYOP initiatives by providing news media with access to, and information about, U.S. and
   allied military capabilities, intentions or mission outcomes. PA operations also can
   preempt the enemy‟s success in degrading PSYOP efforts with consistent, public
   delivery of the truth. PA protects Airmen from enemy PSYOP through internal
   information programs and tactics.
12.9. Media and Community Relations. These programs are operated to directly support the
combatant commander in accordance with Joint Publication 3-61, Doctrine for Public Affairs
in Joint Operations and AFDD 2-5.3, Public Affairs Operations. Separate plans will be
developed for each level of command to support the combatant command‟s overarching plan.
   12.9.1. Media operations guidance and supervision are provided by a joint information
   bureau (J1B), Combined Air Operations Center or other PA activity designated by the
   deployed commander. An Air Force base that is a Point of Debarkation for the contingency
   can expect to be tasked to escort news media forward with deployment of military
   personnel.
   12.9.2. Community relations will usually fall within the scope of the Civil Affairs plan and
   Joint Publication 3-57, Doctrine for Joint Civil Affairs.
12.10. Internal Information. 1nternal information programs in combat and contingency
scenarios are a responsibility of the services. AEW PA operations will produce effects-based
internal information products in support of AEW commander and CFACC objectives. Though a
timely flow of accurate information always enhances morale, internal information products can
produce very valuable mission-enabling effects during times of contingency and combat.
Mission-focused topics such as safety, OPSEC, force protection and medical readiness will
always be priority communication topics for warfighting commanders. Public affairs internal
276                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


information products can greatly enhance the mission by reinforcing policy, procedures and
training on these important topics in creative and effective ways. Additionally, internal
information products will often have dual-use value in support of media operations objectives.
   12.10.1. While Joint Task Force commanders may set up a Command 1nformation function
   within the JTF Public Affairs Office, internal information remains the responsibility of each
   Service, even in the forward area.
   12.10.2. News services may be added, especially in the AOR, to provide information on a
   daily basis.
   12.10.3. Products serving the general population will continue but the frequency may be
   adjusted for timeliness.
12.11. Security Review. Security begins at the source.
   12.11.1. Public Affairs will monitor the release of information to prevent compromising
   security, jeopardizing operations, or threatening the safety of servicemembers.
   12.11.2. Deploying servicemembers should be briefed on guidelines for discussions with the
   media as outlined in Joint Publication 3-61, Doctrine for Public Affairs in Joint Operations.
   12.11.3. The release authority for imagery is primarily the joint information bureau,
   however, that authority can be delegated to forward-deployed PA personnel. Wherever the
   release authority may lie for a given operation, PA Airmen should ensure that all Airmen
   assigned to their unit understand and comply with guidelines regarding imagery collection,
   review and release. PAs should work closely with supporting combat camera and visual
   information forces to ensure they clearly understand and comply with imagery collection,
   review, coordination and release authority guidance.
12.12. Expeditionary Planning Council. SAF/PA maintains a Public Affairs Wartime Planning
Council chaired by SAF/PAR, the Air Staff Public Affairs functional manager. AFNEWS,
AFNEWS/BG, MAJCOM/PA deployment managers, and air component PA Planners are
members of the council. SAF/PA is the approval authority for recommendations made by the
council. The council meets annually at the sourcing conference.
   12.12.1. The Public Affairs Expeditionary Planning Council reviews Air Force and joint
   Public Affairs doctrine, policy and guidance; updates guidance and procedures to ensure
   compatibility with OASD/PA and other services‟ programs; monitors the ability of Public
   Affairs to satisfy OPLAN taskings; and reports annually to SAF/PA.
   12.12.2. SAF/PAR will develop AEF guidance as required by AFI 10-400 at the beginning
   of each AEF cycle. MAJCOM and component FAMs will implement the guidance for their
   respective MAJCOM.

Section 12C—Training

12.13. Professional Training. The expeditionary combat and combat support skills required
of all Airmen will vary by theater. Therefore, theater-or operation-unique skills requirements
will be defined only after the support plan is finished. Such requirements may include, but are
not limited to mine recognitions, anti-terrorism measures, or other requirements identified by
the supported command.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           277


   12.13.1. Common Skills, Forward. The core of expeditionary skills required to support the
   Public Affairs mission at a deployment location includes many of the tasks accomplished
   on a day-to-day basis at home station. Public Affairs must:
       12.13.1.1. Understand the command structure of the air component and combatant
       command.
       12.13.1.2. Be familiar with the major weapons systems to be employed from the
       deployment location.
       12.13.1.3. Train to operate the standard computer communications and word processing
       package in the MISCAP or LOGDET, and understand its capabilities. They must be able
       to use electronic mail, perform electronic file transfers, and establish telecommunications
       on the Worldwide Web.
       12.13.1.4. Train Airmen for media interviews. Particular emphasis should be placed
       on senior leaders and others likely to support prominent media events, numerous
       media engagements or interviews on sensitive subjects. However, PA airmen should
       work to ensure all airmen assigned to their unit understand fundamental policy guidance
       regarding release of information to the public and the fundamental skills for supporting
       media interviews.
   12.13.2. Advanced Training. To plan, integrate, coordinate, command and control, execute
   and evaluate an effects-based strategic communication campaign in times of combat and
   contingency, PA Airmen in key leadership and enabling positions will require advanced
   training well beyond their own functional area. PA Airmen in key leadership and
   planning positions must develop and maintain expertise in key elements of joint and Air
   Force doctrine, AOC operations, joint and Air Force planning processes, information
   operations, AEF sourcing and logistics procedures, theater-unique language, history and
   culture knowledge and inter-agency public planning processes. SAF/PAR will establish a
   roadmap defining the capabilities required to meet Expeditionary PA requirements, the
   number of PA Airmen needing such skills and their organizational alignment as well as plans
   for surging to source and realign Airmen possessing such critical skills for key phases of
   combat planning or operations.
12.14. Mobility Training. Mobility training will be accomplished in accordance with AFI
10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution. In addition, Public Affairs officers will take
every opportunity to make combat skills training available to deployable personnel. These are
skills needed to blend in with other functional areas or joint forces in a deployed situation.
The Air Mobility Warfare Center‟s Eagle Flag is not a training exercise; it is an evaluation of the
force module packages. For training, units should consider the use of exercises such as Bright
Star, Agile Leader and others to develop skills required for forward area support.
12.15. Exercises. To be effective, both in evaluating the readiness of Public Affairs and in
providing training opportunities, exercises must duplicate the forward workload as much as
possible. Exercises should also prepare the staff remaining at home for anticipated media,
community relations, and internal information requirements to support and sustain the
deployment.
   12.15.1. When a unit exercises, the scenario should test the ability of deploying and home-
   based Public Affairs operations to perform basic skills.
278                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   12.15.2. When deploying into a joint environment, the unit can expect to draw media
   attention (local, national and international) both at the deployment location and home base.
   Community support activities may range from very positive support to violent
   demonstrations, depending on the acceptability of the operation to the public. Internal
   information needs will vary depending on the timing of the deployment and advance
   preparations. Public Affairs should exercise in those kinds of environments when testing
   deployment procedures to familiarize the command staff with potential situations they can
   expect to encounter.
   12.15.3. After-Action Reports and Lessons Learned. In order to ensure organizational
   learning and gain the benefits of participating in exercises, PA participants will prepare
   after-action reports that include lessons learned and recommendations. These reports will
   be sent to the appropriate MAJCOM/PA FAM and forwarded to SAF/PAR and the air
   component PAOs as necessary.

Section 12D—Operations Plans Annexes

12.16. Public Affairs Annexes to Operational Plans. Air Force Public Affairs plans for a
variety of roles both operationally and within support functions. The relevant combatant
command PA staff will be responsible for PA planning within theater and ultimate execution,
while air component PA staffs will create sub-plans and be responsible for telling the joint
airpower story. Air Force PAOs at units subordinate to air component commands must plan to
support both combatant and component requirements. PAOs serving stateside or within
commands outside the operational chain of command must do the same and ensure support to
both forward and rear areas of operations, including information support to Reserve
Component and other services‟ families in the local area. Each war or contingency plan
annex should contain, at a minimum, appendices for media support, internal information--to
include a tab outlining a product priority list, community relations (as appropriate), American
Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) support and an estimate of logistical, manpower
and financial requirements. The appendices should not restate supported plan requirements for
each area. However, a summary of the supported plan should be presented in sufficient detail to
ensure those executing the plan understand the objectives and the intent.
   12.16.1. Annex F. This annex to OPLANs stipulates the concept of the overall conduct of
   the Public Affairs program in support of the operation or exercise being planned. It should
   also provide a coordinated list of logistical, manpower and financial requirements needed to
   fully support the operation or exercise plan. Normally, an annex to a supporting plan will be
   written by the Air Force component command Public Affairs staff in response to a
   combatant command tasking. Each subordinate plan annex will state how levied support
   requirements will be satisfied. Each command level must also explain tasking for its own
   requirements to subordinate levels and other supporting functional areas.
   12.16.2. Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data. The TPFDD is the document that tells
   war planners which capability is deploying to where and when--for all intents and
   purposes, a deployment schedule. TPFDDs list the UTCs that are being deployed, the tasked
   unit, UTC origin and final destination (and all points in-between), project departure and
   arrival dates, number of personnel associated with the UTC, weight of all associated
   equipment and other important information for logistics planners. Together, the OPLAN
 AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           279


     and the TPFDD tell PA planners what needs to be done and what PA forces are deploying
     in to assist. TPFDDs are usually managed at the air component level and are normally
     classified. Unit plans or logistics readiness offices can provide insight into current
     OPLAN TPFDDs and other deployment related information. Components must consult the
     AEF library to see what PA forces are available and take into consideration current
     deployments when establishing new requirements for contingencies. SAF/PAR will work
     through AF/DPMR to validate new requirements prior to sourcing.

                      PUBLIC AFFAIRS RECOGNITION PROGRAM

Section 13A—Public Affairs Achievement Awards

13.1. Purpose. The Public Affairs Recognition Program is designed to recognize and
encourage sustained and superior performance by both units and individuals in support of the
United States Air Force and Public Affairs organizations.
13.2. Air Force Public Affairs Director’s Excellence Awards. Presented annually to
organizations judged to have conducted the best overall Public Affairs programs in support of
the Air Force mission. A trophy is presented to the organization, and significant contributors
receive certificates. MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs may submit one nomination in each
category. Categories are:
   13.2.1. The Brigadier General Harry J. Dalton Award. Best MAJCOM Public Affairs
   Program. Awarded to MAJCOMs only.
   13.2.2. Large Wing (host wing only or equivalent). Base population more than 4,001.
   Awarded to host unit only.
   13.2.3. Small Wing (host wing only or equivalent). Base population equal to or less
   than 4,000. Awarded to host unit only.
      13.2.4. Community Relations Program.

   13.2.9. Eligibility Requirements. Public Affairs activities throughout the Air Force may

   unit awards unless serving as a FOA/DRU PA office. Base population is defined as the
   number of active-duty, Reserve, Guard and civilian employees assigned to the base. Large
   wing and small wing categories are for the host wing only. Because they essentially serve as
   host wing PA offices, the U.S. Air Force Academy competes in the Large Wing category, and
   the 11th Wing competes in the Small Wing category, not in the FOA/DRU category. As a
   sub organization of AETC, Air Force Recruiting Service competes in the small wing
   category. MAJCOM staffs may only enter the Dalton award category.
13.3. Air Force Public Affairs Director’s Special Achievement Awards. Presented annually
to organizations for exceptional performance. MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs may submit only
ONE nomination in each category to SAF/PA; however, multiple awards may be presented at the
Air Force level. A trophy is presented to each winning organization, and significant contributors
receive certificates. Units may not be nominated as significant contributors. Categories are:

 contact is encouraged for more information on Hometown News Service procedures and
 policies.       The Hometown News Service can be reached via e-mail at
 hometown@afnews.af.mil.
     14.9.1. Save time and effort by coordinating in advance on subjects ranging from questions
     of suitability or timeliness to advice on timesaving methods. For planning purposes, prior
     coordination on group projects involving large numbers of people is extremely beneficial,
     both to the unit and the Hometown News Service for planning purposes.
     14.9.2. Make suggestions for improving procedures or policies directly to Hometown News
     Service.
 14.10. Media Query. Hometown News periodically queries print and electronic media to
 determine what services are desired and to update coverage areas.

       the Hometown News products and services.
       14.10.2. Media comments or criticisms should be sent to Hometown News Service so
       corrective action may be taken.
 14.11. Usage Reports. Hometown News Service no longer distributes a monthly report to
 each Public Affairs code designee. A special page on the Hometown News Service web site,
 HometownLink, was created to allow Public Affairs offices access to hometown news release
 submission and release statistics at any time, listing submissions, unusable forms and total
 releases generated.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                          299


Section 14D—Operating Procedures

14.12. Submitting Hometown News Material. There are several ways to send hometown
news release forms. Through traditional mail, Public Affairs sends the completed DD Form 2266
and supporting information and photographs to AFNEWS/HNP, 203 Norton Street, San Antonio
TX 78226-1848. For e-mail submissions, attach the Formflow or PDF versions of the DD Form
2266 to e-mail and send it to: home- town@afnews.af.mil. Online forms can be accessed
through the PAO‟s Only” section of the Hometown News web site, HometownLink, at
http://hn.afnews.af.mil. Public Affairs or Unit Public Affairs Representatives can register and
fill out and submit forms directly to Hometown News. For online submissions, photographs can
be sent separately via e-mail or mailed through traditional mail. For activities involving a large
number of individuals, information from which to write a news story (the cover story) should
be sent along with the first batch of forms.
14.13. Public Affairs Office Code. A Public Affairs office code is assigned by each MAJCOM
in coordination with the Hometown News Service. For separate operating activities, Public
Affairs office codes are assigned by the Hometown News Service. These codes are used to
credit forms and photographs to appropriate Public Affairs offices in reports. Forms arriving at
Hometown News with no code are credited to a general Air Force or Army category, with no
credit for the individual Public Affairs office or MAJCOM.
14.14. Status Changes. The Public Affairs office must notify Hometown News of any
significant change in the status of an individual after a DD Form 2266 has been sent (see
paragraphs 14.4.4., 14.6. and 14.8). The notification must include name and social security
number of the story subject. Hometown News telephone numbers are found in the Worldwide
Public Affairs Directories. E-mail correspondence to:hometown@afnews.af.mil. The message
address is afnews.tss@lackland.af.mil, message must be sent priority. Status changes to be
reported include:
   14.14.1. Death of the individual.
   14.14.2. Death of a relative listed in the DD Form 2266.
   14.14.3. Arrest of the individual.
   14.14.4. Change in marital status of the individual: divorce, death of spouse, etc.
   14.14.5. Changes of address for relatives listed on the form.
14.15. Timeliness. Materials received and stories released by the Hometown News Service
must be timely and current. Because the material is news, the sooner it is received,
processed, and sent to the media, the better its chances of being used.
   14.15.1. Although the suggested time limit for the submission of a release is 60 days, the
   ultimate decision on the timeliness of a story will be determined by the originating Public
   Affairs office.
   14.15.2. A DD Form 2266 filled out more than 30 days after an event, such as an exercise,
   must be re-verified. After 30 days, the risk of old or incorrect data due to death, change of
   address, assignment, marital status, etc., becomes so great the Hometown News Service will
   not risk embarrassing the individual, relatives, the news media, or the Army or Air Force by
 300                                              AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


     issuing incorrect personal data. The individual or Public Affairs may verify information by
     signing and dating DD Form 2266, item 21.
 14.16. Story 1nformation. All stories must have sufficient information about the
 individual and the event to develop the news release properly. Although most information is
 on the DD Form 2266, citations, fact sheets, and other appropriate background material, when
 available, should be attached and submitted. Staple supplemental material to the back of the
 form.
 14.17. Nonstandard Story Topics. Some events are outside the routine story categories listed
 in Figure 14.5 With advance coordination, the Hometown News Service will work such stories
 into its production schedule. Public Affairs writes the basic stories for such events and activities.

10. Commander‟s Award for Civilian Service.
NOTE: To determine whether a nonstandard story is suitable, call the Hometown News Print
Division.

 14.18. Stories Involving Large Groups.
     14.18.1. Before sending a news story on an event involving 500 or more people, contact
     the Print News Division. This allows the division to program the story into its production
     schedule.
     14.18.2. Package DD Forms 2266 together with the cover story. Each form must include a
     project identification phrase such as Operation ENDURING FREEDOM in the event
     item, item 8. This phrase ensures the story facts can be identified should a DD Form 2266
     become separated from the package.
     14.18.3. Group DD Forms 2266 from schools by Air Force specialty code or Military
     Occupational Specialty.
 14.19. National Guard and Reserve Releases. Group or Unit Stories. DD Form 2266
 coverage of group activities presents a unique problem. Because every hometown news story
 deals with one individual, and most members of the unit reside in the same hometown, editors
 in the locations of the units or groups would be flooded with multiple copies of the same story
 with only the names changed. Because of this, DD Form 2266 coverage of group or unit
 activities cannot be accepted unless hometown ties outside the unit‟s location can be provided.
 Stories concerning individual members of the National Guard and Reserves on active duty for
 training are handled just as are similar stories for active duty members. Reservists on extended
 active duty are considered to be active duty members.
 14.20. ROTC Submission. ROTC cadets are eligible for home town news coverage:
       14.20.1. DD Form 2266 should be used to record information on individual cadets.
     14.20.2. Detachments must coordinate with the school‟s public relations department before
     submitting hometown news release forms about cadets, because releases often are made by
     the school on a routine basis.
 14.21. Civilian Employee Releases. The Hometown News Service makes releases about
 civilian employees when the story is of significance, such as an award, promotion or other
 major event. See Figure 14.6 for standard story categories.
 14.22. Use of DD Form 2266. The DD Form 2266 is the primary source of information used
 to prepare accurate news stories about active duty, National Guard, Reserve, and ROTC
 members and civilian employees for the hometown media. The form may be overprinted
 locally to meet particular unit needs. However, an original signature and privacy act statement
 are required by Hometown News Service (HNS) for release. For more information, refer to the
 Hometown News Release Guidebook published by Army and Air Force Hometown News
 Service.
     14.22.1. Story topics. The PAO is responsible for determining if the story topic is valid for
     hometown news release (see Figure 14.5 for suitable topics).
 AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                          303


     14.22.2. Hometown ties. Public Affairs must ensure persons filling out the forms have
     valid hometown ties. A valid hometown tie is a living relative such as parent, other blood
     relative, in-IAW, stepparent, foster parent, or former guardian who lives in a
     community in the United States or its possessions. The only exceptions are National
     Guard and Reserve members and civilian employees who themselves may be the hometown
     ties. Due to security reasons, spouses and dependent children are not valid hometown ties.
     14.22.3. Reasons for rejections. If a DD Form 2266 does not contain all required information
     or does not meet the criteria for release, a hometown news release cannot be made.
     Unusable forms are returned to the submitting unit with reasons for rejection indicated.
     14.22.4. Original copy. Send only the original copy of DD Form 2266 for each individual.
     Forms with carbon copy or duplicated signatures are not acceptable. This is to avoid the
     possibility of duplicate news releases being made.
     14.22.5. Electronic forms. When servicemembers fill out an electronic Hometown News
     release, it is important a printed copy of the completed form be signed and retained by Public
     Affairs for at least 90 days. The information on the form is used to answer any media
     queries and the signature is used to verify approval by the servicemember to release next-of-
     kin information to the media. The electronic version can then be e-mailed to the Hometown
     News Service for processing.
 14.23. Instructions for Completing DD Form 2266. Complete the DD Form 2266 using the
 guidance on the reverse of the form. Forms may be filled out in pen, or typed, but must be
 legible. To ensure the appropriate Public Affairs office receives credit for the form and to give
 the Hometown News Service a contact when further information is needed, the space at the top
 of the form must contain the unit name and Public Affairs office code.

 Section 14E—Photographs

 14.24. Color Photographs. Photographs generally enhance acceptance of stories. When
 available, color photos are sent with the printed news releases. High quality photographs or
 color negatives may be submitted with the DD Forms 2266.
     14.24.1. Digital Photographs. When sending a digital image to accompany a hometown news
     release, there are a few specific guidelines to follow. Any images scanned should be in a
     5x7-inch format, regardless of the original size, at 600 dpi resolution, with no less than
     eight-bit pixel depth per color. Do not alter the images before sending. Do not change
     image size, and send in the original uncompressed format or JPEG compress at maximum
     quality. Always shoot the image at the highest possible resolution, and at the lowest
     allowable ASA setting. Try to use fill flash for detail.
 14.25. Types of Photographs. Photographs generally may be classified as action shots or
 mug shots. The news media prefer action shots.
     14.25.1. Action Shots. The best action shots are those showing the individual on the job
     or in the activity described in the news release. Although action shots take more effort to
     produce, they are more widely used by editors because they help tell the story. The
     individual should be prominently featured. A photograph of the individual on the job is
     almost always acceptable for any event.
     14.25.2. Mug Shots. When action shots are not available, mug shots are an acceptable
     alternative. Mug shots are head and shoulders photographs, preferably posed full face
     (looking at the camera). Such shots take less time to produce, especially when a project
     involves a large number of people, such as basic training or school graduates.
 14.26. Identification of Photographs. Provide full identification, name, rank, and job
 title, on the accompanying DD Form 2266, item 19, for all persons in the photograph. Be sure
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           305


to describe the activity shown in action photographs. Identify each photograph or negative so it
can be connected with the appropriate form.
   14.26.1. The best method of identifying mug shots is to use a name board held centered at
   shirt pocket level. Use a card, steno pad, or chalk board no smaller than 5x8-inches. List
   the last name and first and middle initials on the first line and rank on the second line. If a
   name board is not used, provide identification on the negative envelope.
   14.26.2. When sending a large number of DD Forms 2266 for the same story (such as class
   graduations or exercises), photographs may be sent as rolls of developed, uncut film. On
   rolls of uncut film, each identification number must be entered on DD Form 2266, item 19,
   and on the negative. Identification numbers must be consecutive on the roll of negatives.
   Identification numbers should be coded so the negatives can be printed in high-speed,
   automatic printers. For example, the first person in class 0384 is given the number 001.
   The photograph identification number for that person would be 0384001. The number for
   the next person in that class would be 0384002. The sequence must identify the order in
   which the photograph was taken. That same number will be written on the DD Form 2266.
   Continue with the same numbering system even if you use more than one roll of film. Do
   not use the same number for different people.
14.27. Negative requirements.
   14.27.1. Negatives should be in strips of six frames (or equivalent length) or longer. The
   frame to be printed must be clearly indicated and must correspond to the DD Form 2266 it
   accompanies.
   14.27.2. Single negatives should not be sent as they cannot be loaded into the automatic
   printers. If only a single negative is available, substitute a good quality 4x5-inch or 5x7-
   inch photograph, which will be copied at the Hometown News Service.
   14.27.3. Attach the necessary identification to the back of the photograph. Do not write
   information on the back of the photograph as such writing may break the emulsion on the
   front or bleed through the photograph. When the emulsion is broken, the photograph
   cannot be copied. Identification requirements are the same for negatives as for prints.
14.28. Quality of Photographs. Check the quality of each negative or print for scratches,
overexposure or underexposure, and proper development. If the negative is properly exposed and
developed, newspaper print can be read through the darkest part. If a negative is not available, a
high-quality print is acceptable. All prints must be glossy, of normal contrast, and of the highest
possible quality. See Figure 14.7 for pictorial quality guidelines.
   14.28.1. Instant processing photographs are not recommended. These are acceptable only if
   they are of high quality. Most instant processing prints must be rejected because of streaks
   and other marks that occur during developing, or because the images are too small.
   14.28.2. All photographs must be properly packaged to prevent damage in mailing. Large
   photographs should be backed with cardboard or other sturdy material. Negatives, prints,
   and proof prints should be put in protective envelopes and taped or stapled to the back of the
   DD Form 2266. Do not staple in the image area. Do not use paper clips. Suitable
   envelopes for protecting negatives, prints, and proof prints are available through supply
   channels. Mark the outer envelope or package ”PHOTOGRAPHS--DO NOT BEND.”

 14.29. Content of Photographs. In addition to the basic rules for photojournalism, special
 requirements for hometown news photographs are:
     14.29.1. Feature the Individual. The individual who is the subject of the news release must
     be highlighted with facial features visible and recognizable. No more than two people
     should be in the photograph, and then only when necessary to the story (such as presenting
     an award). A photograph will not be released unless all people are identified.
     14.29.2. Proper Attire. Civilian clothes are not acceptable unless they are pertinent to the
     story or are the normal working attire of the individual. Utility uniforms, flight clothing,
     and other special uniforms should be worn in action photographs when appropriate to the
     story. For example: an aircraft maintenance specialist working on an aircraft. Proper
     headgear should be worn in all outdoor scenes. Headgear is optional in mug shots. If
     headgear is worn, it must not obscure facial features or cast shadows across the face.
     Security badges and sunglasses should not be visible. Jewelry must not be visible when the
     subject is shown performing maintenance duties, even if the equipment is not in
     operation.
     14.29.3. Proper Grooming. The story subjects and other military people must meet
     requirements of established standards for military appearance.

14.30. Teams Purpose. HNS field teams travel worldwide and conduct radio, television, and
photo feature interviews with individuals at their duty locations.
       14.30.1. Team structure. A team is usually composed of a reporter/producer, and a
       photographer or TV camera operator. The requesting unit may be asked to provide
       personnel assistance, such as a Public Affairs specialist, depending upon the availability
       of Hometown News Service personnel.
       14.30.2. Unit posturing. The goals are normally between 100 and 300 interviews per
       story idea for radio and print features, and 50-75 television interviews per story idea;
       however, more than one story idea per trip may be combined to achieve these goals.
       14.30.3. Story content. The focus of each story is the individual telling a story in his or
       her own words within the framework of a feature or news peg. The stories generally
       concern individuals involved with equipment, hardware, exercises, or other photogenic
       activities. Stories tied in with national news events are desirable.
14.31. Story Suggestions. Public Affairs at all levels are encouraged to contact Hometown
News to offer suggestions for development by the field news teams. Stories must have a visual
impact to accommodate television or provide photo possibilities for feature articles.
14.32. Approval and Release Authority. All release materials created within the Hometown
News Service are individually evaluated for proper format and content. No product that might
embarrass the individual, unit, or Air Force and Army will be released. Final approval and
releasing authority is the Hometown News director.
14.33. Requesting Team Coverage. Send requests for a field news team to AFNEWS/HNP,
203 Norton Street, San Antonio TX 78226-1848 or via e-mail to hometown@afnews.af.mil,
at least 30 days in advance. This limitation does not apply for unforeseen happenings such as
disaster relief and emergency military operations. Initial contact by telephone is encouraged.
       14.33.1. Requests should include:
          14.33.1.1. Event or news story.
          14.33.1.2. Specific locations for production or release materials.
          14.33.1.3. Dates team coverage is desired.
          14.33.1.4. Number of military people expected to take part in the program.
          14.33.1.5. Name, address, and telephone number of project officer or point of
          contact.
       14.33.2. Field news team per diem and travel costs are borne by Hometown News.
       Requests for news team coverage are approved by Hometown News Service, based on
       available funds and people, other scheduled events, and importance of the news.
       Scheduled events are not approved automatically, and requests must be coordinated with
       the Hometown News Service before including any references to such coverage in any
       operations orders, annexes, or similar documents. To give balanced coverage to
       individuals in different commands, it may be necessary to rotate coverage among them.
14.34. Photo/Print Feature Teams. The features program provides expanded stories
highlighting the individual to his or her hometown audience as a person, not as an adjunct to a
 308                                            AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


 piece of equipment, unit, or particular mission. The feature release is different from a release
 produced by radio and television in that no specific news peg is required for release and
 acceptance. Story ideas concerning one or two people are not cost-effective. Normally at least 20
 interviews per day are needed to justify sending a features team on location.
         14.34.1. Photo/Print Features Format. The photo feature release consists of a three- to-
         four-page story about an individual, one or more stock photographs, and a photograph
         of the individual on the job. Cutlines for the photographs also are provided in the
         package.
 14.35. Radio Field Teams. Taped radio interview releases must meet the exacting professional
 and technical standards of the broadcasting industry. Hometown News provides the specialist
 and digital audio equipment needed to produce radio releases on Air Force and Army people
 around the world. A radio broadcaster travels throughout the military focusing on such stories
 as humanitarian efforts, high visibility or exotic exercises, new technology and peacekeeping
 missions. Radio also has the ability to record phone (beepers) interviews from around the
 world, producing a single, unique, hard news type story on a service member involved in a
 national or international event. News items about normal day-to-day activities of Air Force and
 Army people usually are not acceptable to radio news directors.
 14.36. Television Field Teams. The Hometown News Television Branch provides the
 specialists and equipment needed to produce videotapes meeting exacting professional and
 technical standards of the television broadcasting industry.
         14.36.1. Television demands a strong news peg as well as a strong visual story for a
         release to be accepted. Suitable subjects are those capable of being treated as a news
         feature item. Stories should be interesting in an interviewee‟s hometown, not just at
         the local base, and should be worthy of national news treatment.
         14.36.2. News items that cannot provide adequate visual action or interest, as well as
         those dealing with normal day-to-day activities of Air Force and Army people usually are
         not broadcast. In general, topics suitable for internal release often are not right for
         commercial television markets. At least 75 interviews are needed to justify the expense
         of sending a TV production team to the field.

 Figure 14.8. Normal Support Requirements for Hometown News Service Field News
 Teams.

1. Government quarters and mess for team members during the TDY, if possible.
2. Secure storage area for production equipment.
3. Surface transportation at TDY destination for team members and equipment, if possible.
4. Appropriate location for production of photographs and interviews. Specific locations may be
coordinated with the team chief after arrival at the installation.
5. Representative at location from the host unit for liaison and assistance as required.

                                          Chapter 15

                            SECURITY AND POLICY REVIEW

15.1. Purpose and Objectives of Security and Policy Review. Security Review represents an
on-going effort to inform and increase public understanding of the mission, operations and
programs of the U.S. Air Force. The program ensures that material proposed for public release,
including Web sites, is accurate, does not contain classified material and does not conflict with
established Air Force, DOD or U.S. Government policy. The objective at all levels must be the
maximum clearance of information in minimum time. In support of this objective, U.S. Air
Force policy provides for clearance by the Public Affairs officer at the lowest level where
competent authority exists to judge the security and policy aspects of the information submitted
for review.
15.2. General Guidelines.
   15.2.1. Maximum Disclosure. The Air Force is obligated to provide the public maximum
   information about Air Force operations and activities. Air Force Public Affairs offices will
   clear, without delay, the maximum amount of information at the lowest competent review
   level.
   15.2.2. Clearance Authority. Authority and direction for the conduct of the Security
   Review is derived from Executive Order 12958 and DODI 5230.29, Security and Policy
   Review of DOD Information for Public Release.
       15.2.2.1. Clearance vs. Release. The security and policy review process determines the
       suitability for public release of information. A clearance does not grant an approval to
       release the information. Release of information is the decision of the originator, often
       reached through the coordination with his or her chain of command. Security
       reviews identify classified or sensitive information. They do not classify or
       declassify information. The office of primary responsibility determines original
       classification.
       15.2.2.2. Air Force material submitted for review may be released to the public domain
       only after it has been reviewed for security and policy consistency and cleared by a
       competent authority.
       15.2.2.3. Originators must not release copies of the material outside official channels
       until the security review authority confirms clearance.
       15.2.2.4. Disclosure of administrative error or inefficiency is not grounds for a denial
       of public release.
       15.2.2.5. Air Force offices and functional elements are expected to render expert
       opinion during the review process and must provide prompt response, guidance and
       assistance to the security review authority.
       15.2.2.6. Air Force personnel should make no commitments, including date of delivery,
       to furnish abstracts or manuscripts to non-DOD publications until cleared through security
       review channels.
310                                             AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


15.3. OASD/PA and SAF/PA Level Clearances. OASD/PA and SAF/PA approval is
required for the following types of PA releases:
   15.3.1. Originates, or is proposed for release, in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area.
   This policy does not apply to technical papers intended for presentation at conferences or
   meetings that do not fall under other categories of required submission. When in doubt,
   submit.
   15.3.2. Is, or has the potential to become, an item of national or international interest. All
   three- and four-star general officers and their civilian counterparts‟ written and oral public
   presentations are considered to be “of national and international interest.”
   15.3.3. Affects national security policy or foreign relations.
   15.3.4. Concerns subjects of potential controversy among DOD components or with other
   Federal agencies.
   15.3.5. Information presented by general officers which contains only information which
   has been previously cleared or released by the U.S. Air Force, such as Air Force messages
   or restatements of the Air Forces policies, may be cleared locally. Is presented by a DOD
   employee who, by virtue of rank, position or expertise, would be considered an official
   DOD spokesperson. All three- and four-star generals and civilian counterparts are
   considered official DOD representatives.
   15.3.6. Contains technical data, including data developed under contract or independently
   developed and controlled by the international traffic in arms regulations (ITARs) that may
   be militarily critical and subject to limited distribution, but on which a distribution
   determination has not been made.
   15.3.7. New weapons or weapon systems, significant modifications or improvements to
   existing weapons or weapon systems, equipment or techniques.
   15.3.8. Military operations, operations security and significant exercises.
   15.3.9. National Command Authorities; command, control, communications, computers
   and intelligence; information warfare or computer security.
   15.3.10. Military activities or applications in space, nuclear weapons, including
   weapon-effects research; chemical and biological warfare issues; biological and toxin
   research, high-energy lasers and particle beam technology; arms control treaty
   implementation.
   15.3.11. Any other contemporary topic that is designated by DOD‟s Office of Freedom of
   Information and Security Review, or OFOISR.
15.4. Major Commands (MAJCOM), Field Operating Agencies (FOA) and Direct
Reporting Units (DRU). Clearance authority should be delegated to the Public Affairs
organization at the lowest echelon qualified to evaluate the contents and implications of the
subject. At the local level:
   15.4.1. The Public Affairs organization with security review authority clears unclassified
   information of local or regional interest. This includes speeches, presentations, papers,
   multimedia material and information proposed for release to a publicly accessible
   Worldwide Web site. Guidance on Web release policy can be found in AFI 33-129.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                            311


   15.4.2. The local commander or designated representative clears news or photos of national
   interest.
15.5. What Must Be Submitted. DODD 5230.9, Clearance of DOD Information for Public
Release, requires information relating to the plans, policies, programs or operations of DOD or
the U.S. Government proposed for public release be sent through Public Affairs channels to
the appropriate clearance level for review. Whether information is prepared as an official release
or a personal enterprise, it must be reviewed and cleared before release. Originators must ensure
disclaimers accompany all publications they authorize in a private capacity. An appropriate
disclaimer is: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily
reflect the official policy or position of the Air Force, the Department of Defense or the U.S.
Government.
   15.5.1. All Air Force military and civilian personnel, including Air National Guard and
   Air Force Reserve personnel on active duty who release material related to their active duty
   assignment, retired military members, civilians under DOD contract, and former Air Force
   civilian employees will use this review service to ensure DOD-related information released
   to the public is consistent with their requirement to safeguard classified material.
   15.5.2. Contractors. Contractors must submit material proposed for public release for review
   according to valid contract requirements as specified in DD Form 254, Department of
   Defense Contract Security Classification Specification, DOD 5220.22-R and DOD 5220.22-
   M apply.
   15.5.3. DOD School Policy. DOD gives its personnel in its school environments the widest
   latitude to express their views. To ensure a climate of academic freedom and to encourage
   intellectual expression, students and faculty members are not required to submit papers or
   material that are prepared in response to academic requirements and not intended for
   release outside the academic institution. Information proposed for public release or made
   available in libraries or databases to which the public has access shall be submitted for
   review.
15.6. Information Not Requiring Review.
   15.6.1. Information not involving DOD operations or personnel.
   15.6.2. Personal letters to the editor, book or theatrical reviews when expressing a personal
   opinion, and works of fiction (short stories, novels, and plays) that are not sourced from active
   duty experience. Such information must not imply Air Force or DOD sanction. When there
   is doubt as to the security classification of information, submit it for review.
15.7. What Cannot Be Written About. Air Force military and civilian personnel may write
signed articles for open publication, unless such activity:
   15.7.1. Conflicts with the public receiving prompt and complete information on government
   activities through the usual media.
   15.7.2. Violates IAWs or policies.
   15.7.3. Violates ethical standards or does not comply with DODD 5500.7, Standards of
   Conduct.
312                                              AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   15.7.4. The author cannot use official DOD information generally not available to the public
   and that would not be released under DOD 5400.7, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
   Program.
15.8. Submitting Material for Review. For timeliness, MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs may
conduct concurrent reviews with SAF/PAX, forwarding their final clearance position once it is
determined. For planning purposes, allow at least 10 workdays for Air Force-level review
and clearance, and at least 30 workdays for DOD and other Federal agency review and
clearance. Some material may take longer depending on the volume and complexity of its
content. SAF/PAX requires 10 copies of all materials to be reviewed. In addition, SAF/PAX does
not accept material for review via e-mail.
   15.8.1. To expedite review and clearance, each package submitted must include a memo
   containing:
       15.8.1.1. Name, title, and organization of originating unit, author or speaker.
       15.8.1.2. Title of article or presentation.
       15.8.1.3. Statement on where, when, and how the information is to be released, and the
       sponsoring organization, if appropriate.
       15.8.1.4. Clearance date required by originator. Give a reason, if earlier than date of
       presentation or publication.
       15.8.1.5. Statement that information has been reviewed at the appropriate lower level
       and is recommended for public release, or that it is in concurrent review, with final
       recommendation to follow.
       15.8.1.6. Signed or initialed notation by author or speaker indicating approval of the text.
       15.8.1.7. When applicable, include a statement on technical material that export
       restrictions and militarily critical technologies as well as current Air Force and DOD
       policies have been considered. Provide all relevant comments from field unit technical
       coordinators and attach contractor transmittal letter, if it contains pertinent data.
   15.8.2. Technical materials. For technical papers, include an abstract in lay terms and, if
   appropriate, tell why releasing the information is important to DOD. An abstract to be
   published in advance also must be reviewed, but such review does not satisfy the
   clearance requirement for the entire paper. Always state the previously cleared abstract case
   number when requesting review of the full text.
   15.8.3. Classified references are not recommended because they provide intelligence
   “shopping lists“ and are not available to the general public.
   15.8.4. Generally, previously cleared information does not need to be submitted for review
   unless it contains substantive changes, or it is used in conjunction with other unclassified
   material. Cleared unclassified information may inadvertently be combined in such a
   manner that together it becomes classified or raises policy concerns.
   15.8.5. Presentations by senior ranking individuals. A speech or presentation by an
   individual who, by virtue of rank, position or expertise would be considered an official DOD
   spokesperson (generally persons at the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force level or above or
   at the rank of Lieutenant General or above) when speaking on national issues or events,
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         313


   must be submitted for Security and Policy review. SAF/PAX forwards these speeches to
   OFOISR for review.
   15.8.6. Speeches. Speeches can be submitted in bullet format if the essence of the
   information is apparent to the reviewer. The clearance of bullet-format material will,
   however, cover only that information presented for review. It will not include
   extemporaneous remarks made during the presentation. Full text is strongly recommended.
   15.8.7. Electronic Submittal. Do not submit items for clearance via routine e-mail or the .mil
   system. This system does not permit for official use only (FOUO) information and often
   sensitive/classified information is discovered during the Security Review process.
   15.8.8. Annual Review. Public Affairs offices will conduct an annual, multi-disciplinary
   review of public Web sites at their location. Multi-Disciplinary Review Boards will consist
   of representatives from Public Affairs (who serves as chairperson), Communications and
   Information, Legal, Contracting, and Operations as well as any other representatives
   necessary to address questions concerning the sensitivity of information on a public Web site.
   The site reviews will review publicly accessible Web sites to ensure information that is
   sensitive from the operational, public affairs, acquisition, technology, privacy, legal, or
   security perspective does not appear on the public Web site and determine if sensitive
   information is being properly protected. These reviews will coordinate across organizational
   boundaries as necessary (both vertically and horizontally) to ensure that the aggregation of
   electronic information does not endanger national security or personal privacy of Air Force
   members, civilian employees or their families.
15.9. Additional Review Considerations.
   15.9.1. Operations Security (OPSEC) Considerations. OPSEC is a process of collecting,
   identifying and analyzing information on friendly military operations and other activities to
   identify and minimize actions which inadvertently provide an adversary timely indication of
   military action or access to critical information. By identifying and denying this
   information, operational success and force protection are enhanced. The OPSEC analysis
   examines the planning, preparation, execution, and post execution phases of any activity,
   across the entire spectrum of military activity, and in any operational environment. U.S. Air
   Force commanders and decision makers should consider OPSEC during both mission and
   acquisition planning. In fact, the U.S. Air Force implements the OPSEC process in all
   functional areas.
   15.9.2. Scientific and Technical Information (STINFO). The STINFO program ensures
   scientific and technical information make the maximum impact on the development of U.S.
   Air Force technology and ensures the scientific and technical information generated under
   U.S. Air Force contracts and programs make maximum contribution to the national economy.
   15.9.3. American technology is a valuable commodity and is greatly sought after.
   Technology for application to a military weapon system may be considered sensitive as it
   may disclose too much about that potential system. STINFO Officers are responsible for
   reviewing reports etc. and determining which distribution statements should appear on the
   data. Only reports determined to be Statement A can be forwarded for security and policy
   review and then considered for release to the public. This is the only technical information
314                                              AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   that should be considered for a public Web page. (AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific and
   Technical Information.)
  15.9.4. Technology transfer is the process by which knowledge, facilities, or capabilities
  developed in one place or for one purpose are transferred and utilized in another place for
  another purpose to fulfill actual or potential public or domestic needs. The Air Force
  Technology Transfer Program was created to assure all Air Force science and engineering
  activities promote the transfer or exchange of technology with state and local governments
  and the private sector. These activities enhance the economic competitiveness of industry
  and promote the productivity of state and local governments while leveraging the
  Department of Defense (DOD) research and development investment. It is important to
  ensure that any critical data be reviewed prior to release to the public, so that the United
  States does not lose its critical edge in that particular area. The Department of Defense and
  other agencies of the Federal Government have created a series of controls that are in use
  throughout the review process.
   15.9.5. The Military Critical Technologies List (MCTL) is published by DOD and used as a
   reference document, not as a strict regulation or decision tool. It is a guideline listing of those
   technologies that are critical to the security of our nation.
   15.9.6. International Traffic-in-Arms Regulations (ITARs) are a series of State Department
   regulations that lists technical data about arms and munitions prohibited from export. It
   includes any unclassified information that can be used, or be adapted for use, in the
   design, production, manufacture, repair, overhaul, processing, engineering, development,
   operations, maintenance, or reconstruction of arms, ammunition, and implements of war
   contained in the U.S. munitions list.
      15.9.7. Export Control IAWs are the responsibility of the Department of Commerce, and
      were established to provide export control policies and practices. A validated license is
      required from the Department of Commerce for the export of all technical data listed on the
      Commodities Control List.
   15.9.8. Freedom of Information Act. The U.S. Air Force Freedom of Information Act
   program, as described in DOD 5400.7-R, states the public will be allowed to inspect, review,
   and receive copies of U.S. Air Force records. This applies to all records except for records
   exempt under the Act, which, if released, would cause harm to the nation. The exemptions
   fall into nine categories of information.
         15.9.8.1. Classified Records
         15.9.8.2. Internal Personnel Rules and Procedures
         15.9.8.3. Other Statutes
         15.9.8.4. Confidential Commercial Information
         15.9.8.5. Inter or Intra Agency Records
         15.9.8.6. Invasion of Personal Privacy (Privacy Act)
         15.9.8.7. Investigative Records
         15.9.8.8. Financial Institutions
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                        315


       15.9.8.9. Wells-geological/geophysical information
       15.9.8.10. Information which identifies personnel such as rosters, personnel listings
       with names and e-mail addresses.
15.10. Preparing for Security Review. Public Affairs offices should appoint one overall
point of contact to operate the program. Public Affairs offices must keep potential submitters
informed about review requirements and procedures. Establish working relationships with staff
agencies assisting in the review process. Coordinators must understand thoroughly the purpose
of, and their responsibility for security and policy review.
   15.10.1. Program requirements.
       15.10.1.1. Keep a status log on information being reviewed.
       15.10.1.2. Maintain an effective suspense system. Allow 10 workdays for normal
       coordination of cases through your organization. Use a standardized form or format to
       transmit cases to coordinating agencies.
       15.10.1.3. Do not release cases outside official review channels during the security
       review process.
       15.10.1.4. Make inquiries concerning cases being reviewed at higher levels of command
       through Public Affairs channels.
       15.10.1.5. Use all reasonable measures to expedite staffing at all levels to make sure
       publication deadlines, speaking dates, and other valid deadlines are met.
       15.10.1.6. Be sure to check release guidance in other regulations, such as AFI 91-204,
       Safety Investigations and Reports, and AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints
       Resolution.
   15.10.2. While reviewers at lower levels of command may not have access to extensive
   research assistance, official documents exist that can help verify information. U.S. House
   of Representatives and Senate Authorizations and Appropriations hearing reports include
   testimony by DOD witnesses, and are available from the Government Printing Office.
   Posture statements by the Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
   Secretary of the Air Force, and Air Force Chief of Staff are authoritative, cleared
   statements that reflect official policy. The Air Force Issues Web site, the Air Force Policy
   Letter Digest, Air Force Fact Sheets and Airman magazine are other reliable information
   sources.
15.11. Step-by-Step Process.
   15.11.1. Originators submit material through channels to the Public Affairs office with the
   required information (See paragraph 15.8) and correct number of copies.
   15.11.2. Security review personnel log in the case, review the material to determine which
   agencies must see it, establish a suspense date, and dispatch the case for review. For an
   audiovisual product, the security review authority reviews the video and script before
   scheduling a coordination viewing to evaluate the product.
   15.11.3. Coordinating agencies identify either classified information or not consistent with
   official policy. Information for deletion is enclosed in brackets. All marking is done with a
316                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   black pen or pencil only. Do not use colored markings; colors are used at HQ USAF and
   DOD levels to indicate level of clearance.
   15.11.4. The reviewer determines releasability of the material after receiving agency inputs,
   evaluating staff comments thoroughly and contacting agencies to resolve issues.
   15.11.5. After the reviewer determines a clearance position, review action is
   completed or, if required, the case is sent to the next review echelon.
   15.11.6. Once cases have been returned from higher-echelon review, the security review
   authority retains one file copy showing final clearance and any changes and markings to the
   material, plus copies of each reviewing organization‟s signed remarks.
   15.11.7. A copy of the material officially cleared by letter or stamp, with final review
   markings and changes annotated, or correspondence explaining a denial of clearance, is sent
   to the originator.
15.12. Reviewer’s Marking.
   15.12.1. Marking. Inclusive brackets, in black pencil, identify the non-releasable
   information. Bracketed material must be removed before publication of the document. The
   brackets signal a mandatory amendment. Write substitute language above the brackets, in
   black pencil. For editorial changes, line through once in black pencil; do not use brackets.
   15.12.2. Amending. Amendments require specific source citations and rationale. The
   coordinator must provide sufficient information to enable the security review authority to
   sustain an amendment. Such documentation eliminates time-consuming discussion with the
   coordinator. Coordinators must supply three essential pieces of information concerning
   material identified as classified: classification authority, level of classification, and
   downgrading instructions.
   15.12.3. Source Citations:
      15.12.3.1. Classification authority sources frequently cited are: security classification
      guides, provisions of classified contracts (DD Form 254, Department of Defense
      Contract Security Classification Specification), Air Force publications, selected
      acquisition reports, development concept papers, and originating agency‟s
      determination required. When classified material is identified in a security review case,
      advise everyone possessing the document at once to protect it as classified.
      15.12.3.2. Documentation sources can be presidential pronouncements; Defense and
      Air Force official statements; Air Force policy directives, manuals, or policy letters.
   15.12.4. Objection. A coordinator may make overall objection to clearing a case. An
   objection does not require marking on the document, but it does need detailed supporting
   justification. A coordinator may make a total objection to public release, if a case requires
   extensive amendment or rewrite for security or policy concerns.
   15.12.5. Editorial Review. Editorial review is not a responsibility of the security review
   authority, but coordinators may edit for clarity and accuracy. Editorial recommendations
   (deletions) are lined through once with black pencil; do not use brackets. Enter suggested
   substitute with black pencil.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                      317


   15.12.6. Other Coordination. If an agency expert thinks the case should be reviewed by
   another agency, he or she should advise the security review authority. An early call can
   save several days in the review process.
   15.12.7. Timeliness. Major security review time-savers include timely coordination, the use
   of black pencil for marking, and the proper citing of classification sources.
15.13. Appeal Procedures. The originator, or authorized representative, may discuss any
amendment or objection to release with SAF/PAX; however, formal appeals in writing must be
elevated through official Public Affairs channels.
   15.13.1. Appeals must provide strong supporting rationale and authoritative evidence.
   Review authorities evaluate and decide appeals based only on the additional evidence or
   reasoning provided.
   15.13.2. SAF/PAX usually resolves differences of opinion between the originator or
   authorized representative and the reviewing agency. When this is not successful,
   SAF/PAX will arrange for the appeal to be considered at higher echelons of authority,
   either within the Air Force or OASD/PA, as appropriate.

                                           Chapter 16

      AIR FORCE RESERVE AND AIR NATIONAL GUARD PUBLIC AFFAIRS

Section 16A—Air Force Reserve

16.1. Public Affairs Office Structure. The Air Force Reserve Public Affairs function is
made up of three primary management levels. Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command
provides functional management guidance for the Direct Reporting Unit (DRU)
Headquarters Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC) and develops Reserve Public Affairs
policy and provides management oversight of the Reserve unit Public Affairs program. HQ
AFRC/PA works in concert with The Public Affairs Division, Office of Air Force Reserve (HQ
USAF/REIP) to formalize overall Air Force Reserve Public Affairs Policy.
16.2. Reserve PA Airlift Media Rules.
   16.2.1. All AFRC Public Affairs airlift requests are approved via a dual channel (operations
   and PA) method of checks and balances. HQ AFRC/PA reviews requests to ensure proposed
   participants qualify under PA policies and directives. Once qualified, HQ AFRC/PA
   classifies, logs, tracks and forwards the request to HQ AFRC/DO for review/approval.
   16.2.2. AFRC units correspond directly with SAF/LLO regarding unit generated efforts to
   orient local federal level elected Congressional representatives or their local staff aboard unit
   aircraft. However, all correspondence must be provided to HQ AFRC/PAC for concurrence.
   Submit requests to HQ AFRC/PAC and SAF/LLO concurrently.
   16.2.3. Waivers applicable to PA related airlift: Electronic Waivers. Per AFI 11-202, V3,
   General Flight Rules, the use of portable non-transmitting electronic equipment is
   permissible at any altitude when operating in visual meteorological conditions and with the
   approval of the pilot in command (PIC) at 10,000 feet above ground level and higher,
   portable non-transmitting electronic equipment may be used during instrument
   meteorological conditions with the approval of the PIC. The following guidelines apply: (1)
   The aircraft commander will be fully briefed on what equipment will be used and when, (2)
   Any crew member may order the equipment turned off for any reason and (3) The
   equipment will be turned off if any electronic interference is detected by the crew. Cellular
   phones will be turned off and stowed from block out to block in IAW paragraph 2.5.1.4. (The
   use of photo or video equipment in fighter aircraft must be specifically approved by 10
   AF/CC.)
      16.2.3.1. Tactical Waivers. HQ AFRC/DO with the recommendation of HQ AFRC/PA
      is waiver authority for applicable instructions or regulations to allow Public Affairs
      airlift aboard AFRC unit-equipped and Reserve-operated associate unit aircraft
      during the performance of tactical operations. The following restrictions apply: (1)
      Passengers will not be permitted aboard an aircraft operating above 10,000 feet mean
      sea level in a non-pressurized condition. (2) Passengers generally are not permitted
      mobility during the tactical portion of a mission and must remain seated with seat
      belts fastened. If mobility for purposes of photo or video coverage by bona fide news
      media is requested, the mobile individual is required to wear a helmet and harness and
      must be tethered to the aircraft. (3) Any photo equipment used by passengers must
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                        319


      be physically secured to the individual or the aircraft to preclude the possibility of a
      dropped object. It is essential on both the unit PA request to HQ AFRC/PAC and the unit
      scheduler‟s mission identifier (MI) request via the Single Mobility System (SMS) to HQ
      AFRC/DOOM that the type of aircraft, number of passengers and profile of the tactical
      mission (simulated heavy equipment, CDS bundles, personnel airdrops, etc.,) is
      specifically identified.
16.3. Reserve Public Affairs Products.
   16.3.1. Reserve Fact Sheets. Prepares and updates fact sheets to provide reference material
   on missions and units.
   16.3.2. Air Force Reserve Command News Service. Distributes to AFRC units and other
   select DOD users current news, features, and editorial material of command interest.
   16.3.3. Facts and Figures. Produces fliers that provide basic statistical data on units,
   personnel, weapons systems and budget.
   16.3.4. Biographies. Maintains current biographies for unit assigned general officers and
   Reserve wing commanders.
   16.3.5. E-News. Publish a monthly newsletter for unit Public Affairs personnel on current
   Public Affairs issues.
   16.3.6. Citizen Airman Magazine. Manages and produces the magazine‟s publication for the
   chief of Air Force Reserve.
   16.3.7. Weekly Public Affairs Media Memo. Produce a weekly Air Force Reserve

   coverage and Public Affairs airlift activities.
   16.3.8. Weekly Status Report. Track, coordinate, and concur with Public Affairs media,
   civic leader, employer, and ESGR Bosslift flights, and Official Representation Fund
   requests. Distribute weekly updates command wide via e-mail.
   16.3.9. Produces and maintains Air Force Reserve Command Briefing in slide and video
   formats.
   16.3.10. Produces a quarterly Air Force Reserve Command Citizen Airman Video series.
   16.3.11. Maintains Air Force Reserve Command‟s Worldwide Web Public Home page.
   16.3.12. Commander‟s Call Topics: Publish monthly items for use by all Reserve

   16.3.14. Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health Compliance and Management
   Program (ESOHCAMP) Inspections. Participate on ESOHCAMP inspection team
   visits to host base Reserve-owned facilities.
   16.3.15. Environmental Stockholders Report. Support Reserve Civil Engineering in
   production of the subject report as required.
   16.3.16. Assist unit Public Affairs officers in obtaining appropriate environmental training
   to meet skill levels commensurate with each position description‟s mandated responsibilities.
320                                            AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


16.4. Releasing Reserve Information.
   16.4.1. When an Air Force Reservist is performing Public Affairs work while on military
   duty, he or she may use rank and USAFR title in signature blocks or news release bylines.
   Reservists will not use reserve rank and title in connection with civilian public relations or
   news media work.
   16.4.2. Public Affairs offices of units alerted for mobilization must comply with their
   gaining major command‟s guidance for releasing information. Units will send copies of
   news and feature releases generated during mobilization to HQ AFRC/PA. Deployed unit
   members will comply with Public Affairs directives, policy, and guidance of the U.S.
   authority having operational control of Air Force units.
16.5. Reserve Newspapers. Public Affairs offices may publish and mail AFRC unit
newspapers when approved by OASD/PA and SAF/PA.
16.6. Reserve Hometown News Program. Public Affairs offices will use DD Form 2266
to submit news material on Reservists and may submit hometown releases directly to local news
media for Reservists assigned to units in their hometown.
16.7. Reserve Forces Employer Support Program. National Committee for Employer
Support of the Guard and Reserve, or OASD/RA-ESGR, is the DOD agency that oversees
DOD support to civilian employers of reservists. Unit commanders are expected to participate
in activities with their respective state ESGR committees. A major part of the Air Force
support is orientation flights for civilian employers and Bosslifts. They are managed as follows:
   16.7.1. Flight participants are civilian employers of Reserve forces personnel. (Spouses
   are not included unless they are bona fide employers of Reservists in their own right.)
   16.7.2. Orientation flights are generally held in conjunction with employer appreciation
   events.
   16.7.3. OASD/RA-ESGR submits requests for Bosslifts.
16.8. Bosslifts. Bosslifts are an important tool for fostering a strong and supportive employer
base. This program is used to demonstrate to Reserve employers and potential employers the
importance of Reserve Forces.
   16.8.1. Bosslifts proposed by State ESGR committees must be approved at the
   OASD/ RA-ESGR-level. OASD/RA-ESGR will review itineraries for propriety of
   scheduled activities and ensure the proposed guest list does not reflect a preponderance of
   state committee members or any particular group.
       16.8.1.1. State ESGR committees must request Bosslift approval through OASD/RA-
       ESGR and may not directly request airlift approval through a specific unit or
       MAJCOM prior to OASD/ RA-ESGR approval. Each State ESGR Committee will
       coordinate their requests beginning with their Regional Field Representative--who is a
       member of the OASD/RA-ESGR staff.
       16.8.1.2. State ESGR Committees may contact local airlift units to inquire on the
       feasibility of support should HQ ESGR and HQ AFRC approve a Bosslift.
           16.8.1.2.1. C-5 units will not normally be approved to support a Bosslift due to high
           operating costs.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         321


         16.8.1.2.2. Primary aircraft preferred to support Bosslifts will be KC-135s or C-141s
         for cross country distances and C-13Os for intrastate/regional airlifts.
         16.8.1.2.3. All Bosslift participants are required to assemble at one departure location
         and will be returned to the same location. Multiple pickup points must be approved
         on a case-by-case basis by HQ AFRC/DO.
         16.8.1.2.4. Tours outside the CONUS are not permitted.
         16.8.1.2.5. As a DOD directed program Bosslifts may be supported by Reserve
         units flying either Unit Equipped or Associate Unit aircraft.
  16.8.2. Once OASD/RA-ESGR has approved a proposed ESGR Bosslift tour, a request to
  support is forwarded to HQ AFRC/PAC for approval then to HQ AFRC/DOOM where, if
  available, airlift will be sourced. Presently, requests are submitted at the quarterly
  allocation conference. Requests with itineraries should reach HQ AFRC 45 to 60 days in
  advance of travel date and should indicate if any AFRC unit has expressed a willingness to
  support, if approved.
  16.8.3. OASD/RA-ESGR approval does not guarantee a Bosslift will be supported by an
  AFRC airlift or tanker unit. Final determination on support will be made by individual
  commanders based on their unit‟s ability to support a specific request and HQ AFRC
  approval.
     16.8.3.1. Commanders must not obligate their unit to support a specific tour prior to
     OASD/ RA-ESGR and HQ AFRC approval.
     16.8.3.2. Commanders must ensure State ESGR Committee members inquiring on airlift
     support are aware mission requirements may require cancellation of tours up to and
     including the day of departure.
  16.8.4. OASD/RA-ESGR is responsible for monitoring trips requested by State ESGR
  committee members and normally approve only one state ESGR committee sponsored Bosslift
  per year per state.
     16.8.4.1. Units are encouraged to support one-day employer support trips in
     cooperation with state ESGR committees to routine unit and/or other Reserve
     Component training locations.
  16.8.5. Unit Responsibilities.
     16.8.5.1. Before supporting a Bosslift originating from their home station or state,
     commanders should make every effort to nominate a proportionate number of unit
     member employers on proposed Bosslifts.
     16.8.5.2. Provide information packets to attendees that include at a minimum HQ AFRC
     and unit histories, fact sheets on unit aircraft, biography of the commander, crew
     information, etc.
     16.8.5.3. Ensure itinerary includes HQ AFRC and unit briefings to Bosslift participants at
     the earliest time possible. Preferably, brief Bosslift participants at Reserve points of
     departure and/or at visited Reserve unit locations.

       16.8.5.4. Bosslifts requiring ground time in excess of 24 hours at visited locations will
       require the supporting unit to schedule additional flying training at deployed
       location. AFRC/DO is the waiver authority for this requirement.
   16.8.6. Questions and any changes in dates or itinerary should be referred to HQ AFRC/PAC
   at DSN 497-1760 or (912) 327-1760, Fax Ext. 0878.
16.9. Collocating AFR and Active-Duty Public Affairs Offices. HQ AFRC approves
requests to collocate full-time AFR unit Public Affairs personnel with active-duty Public Affairs
offices.
16.10. Unit Training. Public Affairs offices will develop training objectives for UTA
weekends and monitor compliance; establish training plans for DOD Reserve Component
courses; and project travel and per diem costs for DINFOS and other annual or recurring
training requiring funding in annual training budgets. Training funds may be used for AFIT
Courses relating to current PA environmental requirements or to attend annual environmental
and or PA training symposiums sponsored by HQ AFRC or other MAJCOMs.
16.11. Reserve Environmental Requirements. Unit Public Affairs offices will advise HQ
AFRC/PAC and PAN immediately of any environmental incident or accident considered
reportable to HQ AFRC through any command communications channels. This is particularly
true if the event is reportable to state or federal environmental regulators. Unit Public Affairs
officers will ensure they and/or their staffs receive adequate formal environmental training to
meet either host base or tenant Public Affairs environmental requirements, as appropriate.

                                           Chapter 17

                            PUBLIC AFFAIRS PHOTOGRAPHY

17.1. Purpose. Photography is an essential element of internal and external communication
programs. Photographs convey the mission of the Air Force to all of our audiences and help
achieve the core competencies of Airman morale and readiness, public trust and support, and
global influence and deterrence. The Air Force is tasked to perform a wide range of missions,
including those that are very sensitive in nature. Unauthorized photography or filming during
these missions violates Air Force policy, violates the privacy of others and damages our ability to
execute our diverse missions.
17.2. Release of Photographs. Official photographs of general officer and key military and
civilian DOD employees generally are releasable. Photographs of Air Force activities and
people are releasable. However, a photograph is not releasable if it depicts matters that, if
disclosed to public view, would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
   17.2.1. Fatalities or Injured. Official or stock news photographs of Air Force casualties
   may be released after next of kin have been notified. Official or stock news photographs of
   Air Force injured personnel may be released as appropriate. Clearance by injured
   personnel is a courtesy but not a requirement. Do not release photographs showing
   suffering or mutilated persons.
   17.2.2. Children. When photographing children, a parent or legal guardian must sign a
   release allowing the child‟s photo to be used in public such as in a base newspaper. There is
   no exemption for photography of 17-year-old military members, ROTC or Junior ROTC
   cadets.
   17.2.3. Courtrooms/Accused Persons. Do not permit photographs of open or closed Air
   Force court sessions. Unless the accused is a fugitive or unless a IAW enforcement function
   will be served, do not release candid photographs of accused persons. On request from
   media, official photographs should be released as they are obtainable through the Freedom
   of Information Act process. See Chapter 6, Media Operations.
   17.2.4. Installations. Unclassified photographs of installations are releasable. They must
   meet directives that apply on releasing unclassified information, including security review
   requirements. Photography or video of any restricted area‟s entry control point or security
   measures is not authorized.
   17.2.5. Medical Personnel. Do not photograph or film U.S. medical personnel with
   weapons. Medical personnel may only carry arms for self-defense. Photographing or taking
   video of medical personnel with weapons may create the false impression that these personnel
   are violating the IAW of war and needlessly risk their safety.
   17.2.6. Merchandise Endorsements. Do not photograph Air Force people with products or
   merchandise with trade names appearing in such a way they imply Air Force endorsement.
   17.2.7. Signs and Posters. Don‟t photograph them if they are in bad taste.
   17.2.8. Suggestive Photographs.      Do not take or release obscene or suggestive
   photographs. Avoid pin-up, or suggestive photographs of Air Force people.
324                                           AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


   17.2.9. Classified Information. Do not photograph classified materials for public release.
   When taking photographs in operational areas, be conscious of classified weapons, maps, or
   charts that may be in the background.
   17.2.10. Live and inert weapons on aircraft. Generally, unless weapons are displayed at a
   public event, documentation and release of weapons imagery is prohibited, however
   commanders may make exceptions if it is in the best interest of the Air Force to tell a
   specific story through media outlets requesting such photos or video. Photography or
   video of this nature should be accomplished only after consulting with a weapons safety
   representative to determine appropriate safe distances from which to photograph, and with
   a public affairs officer for authorization and coordination. The number of people in the
   vicinity should be limited and commanders should be consulted for operational risk
   management considerations.
17.3. General Guidelines.
   17.3.1. Still photographers assigned to combat camera or installation visual information or
   multimedia service centers are responsible for documentation of activities, including
   requests from Public Affairs. Try to arrange for a photographer to be specially trained and
   available for news and feature photography assignments. When this is not possible, Public
   Affairs should procure necessary photographic equipment in accordance with AFI 33-117,
   Multimedia (MM) Management.
   17.3.2. Military Members. Personal appearance must conform to AFI 36-2903, Dress and
   Personal Appearance of Military Personnel. Pay careful attention to Air Force safety
   standards for people and equipment, such as required wear of safety goggles or hearing
   protection.
   17.3.3. Chain of Command Photographs. Maintaining files of official photographs of Air
   Force and civilian authorities for chain of command display boards is discouraged.
   However, maintaining limited quantities of official photographs to fulfill bona fide requests
   from media and local civic organizations is authorized. These photographs should be
   limited to key unit officials most likely to have frequent contact with the public, plus
   parent unit commanders up to and including MAJCOM and FOA.
   17.3.4. Photographic Record Disposition. 11SC/SCUA, 3 Brookley, Suite 103, Bolling
   AFB, Washington D.C. 20032-0001, is the central point for photographs destined for the
   Air Force Still Photo depository.
17.4. Alteration of Official DOD Imagery. Anything that casts doubt on the credibility of
official imagery in or outside of the Department of Defense is prohibited.
   17.4.1. Credibility of official photographic images. The alteration of a photographic or
   video image by any means for any purpose other than to establish the image as the most
   accurate reproduction of an event is prohibited. Exemptions include:
      17.4.1.1. Using photographic techniques such as dodging, burning, color balancing,
      spotting, and contrast adjustment to achieve the accurate reproduction of an event.
      17.4.1.2. Applying photographic and video image enhancements such as color and
      contrast intensification, magnification, and sharpening in support of unique cartography;
      intelligence; medical; and research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E)
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                           325


      technical requirements. Associated captions specify the particular enhancement applied
      to the image.
      17.4.1.3. The obvious masking of portions of a photographic image in support of specific
      security requirements.
      17.4.1.4. The use of cropping or editing to selectively isolate a portion of an image;
      however, cropping or editing that has the effect of misrepresenting the circumstances or
      facts of the event as originally recorded by the image constitutes a prohibited alteration.
      17.4.1.5. The digital conversion and compression of photographic and video images.
      17.4.1.6. Photographic and video post-production enhancement, including animation,
      digital simulation, graphics, and special effects, used for dramatic or narrative effect in
      education, recruiting, safety and training illustrations, publications, or productions is
      authorized if the enhancement does not misrepresent the subject of the original image;
      or, it is clearly and readily apparent from the content of the image or accompanying test
      that the enhanced image is not intended to be an accurate representation of an actual
      event.
   17.4.2. The use of cropping, editing, or enlargement to selectively isolate, link, or display a
   portion of a photographic or video image is not considered alteration.
   17.4.3. Cropping, editing, or image enlargement that has the effect of misrepresenting the
   facts or circumstances of the event or object as originally recorded is prohibited.
   17.4.4. Photographic enhancement, including digital simulation, graphics and special effects
   used in publications is authorized if the enhancement does not misrepresent the subject of the
   original image. Or, if it is clearly and readily apparent from the context or from the content
   of the image or accompanying text that the enhanced image is not intended to be an accurate
   representation of any actual event.
17.5. Public Affairs Aerial Photography. Public Affairs programs may require aerial
photography that falls outside the guidance outlined in the Communications and Information
instruction, AFI 33-117, Multimedia (MM) Management.
   17.5.1. Internal Information. Air Force Print News (AFPN) and Air Force Television
   News (AFTVN) depend on trained Air Force journalists to gather information and visuals
   (still and video) to produce news stories. When pursuing a flying mission story, AFNEWS
   journalists will observe all safety regulations and follow the directions of the flight crews at
   all times. Use of electronic recording equipment will be granted at the discretion of the
   aircraft commander. Such equipment will be turned off if so directed.
   17.5.2. Media Relations. Because the purpose of media orientation flights and media
   travel is to cover the Air Force mission, reporters, videographers and photographer will be
   authorized to perform aerial photography. Coverage of the mission is on a non-interference
   with mission basis. News media representatives (NMRs) will observe all safety
   regulations and follow the directions of the flight crews at all times. Use of electronic
   recording equipment on aircraft is at the discretion of the aircraft commander IAW AFI 11-
   202, Vol 3, General Flight Rules, Chapter 2. All such equipment will be turned off if
   directed by the aircraft commander. Wireless or digital media equipment may require an
326                                            AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


    electromagnetic analysis and approval prior to use on aircraft in flight. Submit requests for
    analysis and approval IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3.
    17.5.3. Community Relations. Part of what makes an Air Force Tour a memorable
    experience are the photographic memories captured by participants. Air Force Tour
    participants will be allowed to take personal pictures/video within the bounds of safety and
    security. Distinguished Visitors (DVs) will observe all safety regulations and follow the
    directions of the flight crews at all times. Use of electronic recording equipment will be
    granted at the discretion of the aircraft commander. Such equipment will be turned off if so
    directed.
17.6. Captioning Imagery Acquired in Support of Public Affairs. All imagery acquired in
support of the Public Affairs mission must be properly captioned and submitted to the Air Force
Image Accessioning Center (AFIAC) for archiving purposes. Refer to AFI 33-117, Chapter 6,
for complete instructions on image captioning and submittal of imagery to the AFIAC.

       17.6.7.2. Compilations of motion imagery that substantially reflect the original
       appearance of their components shall bear the VIRINs of those components. For other
       compilations, assign a new VIRIN.
       17.6.7.3. The VIRIN is the life-cycle number of each unit of media and shall be the
       number that is used to accession, store, and retrieve media. Each unit or media shall
       be assigned a number--e.g., 35mm transparency, negative, motion picture roll of film,
       videotape cassette or digital image. The VIRIN shall identify all materials forwarded to
       the respective Component Accessioning Points.
17.7. Prohibited Photography. The Air Force is tasked to perform a wide range of missions,
including those that are very sensitive in nature. Unauthorized photography or filming during
these missions violates Air Force policy, violates the privacy of others and damages our ability
to execute our diverse missions. This policy applies to both official and unofficial photography
and filming.
   17.7.1. Personal photography or video of cargo, crewmembers or passengers associated with
   sensitive missions is prohibited. Sensitive missions include, but are not limited to:
   movement of detainees! enemy prisoners of war, special operations activities, detainee
   operations, handling of human casualties, and repatriations of remains.
   17.7.2. Prior to any mission or activity, official public release photography or video will be
   coordinated with Public Affairs at the appropriate headquarters and IAW DOD 5040.4, Joint
   Combat Camera Program, and Public Affairs Policies and Procedures stated previously. This
   restriction applies to any mission, whether executed at home station or while deployed in
   support of contingency operations. Air Force members overseas must comply with status of
   forces agreements, the IAWs of the host nation, and other instructions of the combatant
   commander responsible for that area.
   17.7.3. Detainees or Human Casualties. Photographing, filming or video taping detainees
   or human casualties, as well as the possession, distribution, transfer or posting, whether

  electronically or physically, of visual images depicting detainees or human casualties is
  prohibited, except as required for official duties. Refer to AFJI 31-304, paragraph 1-5d, for
  additional guidance.
  17.7.4. This policy is applicable to all US Air Force personnel and civilians serving with,
  employed by, or accompanying the US Air Force, except for personnel assigned to
  Defense Attach Offices, Security Detachments, and sensitive intelligence and counter
  intelligence activities that are conducted under the direction and control of the Chief of
  Mission/Chief of Station; or other U.S. Government agencies and departments. In these
  cases, personnel will abide by the policies of the appropriate organization or command.
  17.7.5. Operational, internal use only, photography by Air Force photographers or video
  personnel operating in their official capacity (AFSC 3V0X2 and 3V0X3) is also exempt from
  this policy. These personnel are trusted agents whose actions are governed by existing
  DoD and AF policy. Mission needs require Air Force photographers and video personnel to
  cover the full spectrum of visual documentation. DoD 5040 series directives, instructions
  and manuals, and AFI 33-117 provide guidance to Air Force Multimedia personnel on
  documentation of operational missions.

   Internet in any forum can aid the enemy. Professional judgment should be used before any
   products are posted to any mass communication medium. Posting photos or videos
   specifically prohibited by this instruction is forbidden. Possession, distribution, transfer or
   posting, whether electronically or physically, of visual images resulting from any
   unauthorized photography or videos noted in this instruction is prohibited, except as required
   for official duties.

                                 WEB S1TE MANAGEMENT

18.1. Purpose. This chapter outlines the policies and procedures involved in integrating new
technology (including but not limited to the Internet and Worldwide Web) into U.S. Air Force
public and internal communication programs. This chapter complements other Air Force and
Defense policies relating to the use of the Internet and information technology in public and
internal communication strategies. It also outlines the roles and responsibilities associated with
the Air Force Public Web Program.
18.2. Policy. It is U.S. Air Force policy that:
   18.2.1. Using the Worldwide Web and other tools to enhance public awareness of the Air
   Force is strongly encouraged. These technologies provide the U.S. Air Force powerful tools
   to convey quickly and efficiently a wide range of topics relating to the people, mission, and
   resources of the U.S. Air Force.
   18.2.2. These tools provide a force multiplier to U.S. Air Force communication programs
   with considerable mission benefit. However, these benefits must be weighed against
   potential risks to the security of Air Force operations and the privacy and security of Air
   Force personnel.
   18.2.3. All Air Force public Web sites will conform to the security, procedural and
   distribution practices outlined in the time-phased Air Force Public Web Program.

       requirements, unless its release is precluded by current and valid security
       classifications or sensitivity designation. The provisions of the Freedom of Information
       Act will be supported in both letter and spirit.
       18.2.4.2. A free flow of general and military information will be made available, without
       censorship or propaganda, to the general public, including members of the Armed
       Forces and their dependents.
       18.2.4.3. Information will not be classified or otherwise withheld to protect the
       government from criticism or embarrassment.
       18.2.4.4. Information will be withheld only when disclosure would adversely affect
       national security the conduct of federal programs or threaten the safety or privacy of the
       men and women of the Armed Forces.
       18.2.4.5. The department‟s obligation to provide the public with information on its
       major programs may require detailed Public Affairs planning and coordination within
       the department and with other government agencies. The sole purpose of such activity is
330                                             AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009

      content. Additionally, PA should assess the need, requirement, and suitability for release
      of information.
      18.4.7.5. Ensure annual multidisciplinary review of public Web sites.
18.5. Web Site Management.
   18.5.1. Public Web Sites. Public Web sites exist as part of the U.S. Air Force‟s overall
   public communications program, increase public trust and support, contribute to Airmen
   morale and readiness, and enhance global influence and deterrence. Because public Web
   sites have global distribution, information must be cleared in accordance with this
   instruction and DODD 5230.9, Clearance of DOD Information for Public Release. Public
   Web sites will not contain any classification or markings such as “Approved for Public.
   Except for information used in the conduct of electronic commerce, all content for public Web
   sites must be approved by the local Public Affairs office prior to public release.
   18.5.2. Approval to Establish Public Web Content. Approval authority for establishing
   public Web content will correspond to existing authority to make public release of
   information (normally the wing-equivalent commander). Organizations seeking to publish
   public Web content must justify a wide public audience (not military-specific) and
   coordinate with local Public Affairs and communications authorities prior to receiving release
   authority‟s (wing-equivalent commander‟s) approval.
      18.5.2.1. Use of af.mil domain. All official Air Force public Web sites will use the af.mil
      domain. Approved exceptions to this policy include http://www.airforce.com/,
      http://www.afreserve.com/ and http://www.afrotc.com/.
   18.5.3. Security and Policy Review. See Chapter 15, Security and Policy Review.
18.6. Web Site Content.
   18.6.1. General Content. The average wing-equivalent public Web site is a means for wing
   commanders to keep the general public informed of news and information affecting that
   installation. Only information cleared for public release in accordance with AFI 33-129
   and this instruction should be posted to public Web sites. The following provides guidance
   on routinely included items.
      18.6.1.1. Electronic Freedom of Information Act Reading Room Material. Frequently
      requested material released as part of your unit‟s FOIA program may be posted to the
      Web site. Integrating this element into the overall unit Web site provides for a more
      seamless communication image.
      18.6.1.2. Base or Unit Fact Sheet. Maintained locally, base fact sheets may provide
      general history, organization and economic impact of that particular unit or installation.
      18.6.1.3. Links to Key Leaders. Official biographies are maintained within the Air
      Force Link Library.       Biographies must not reveal names, addresses or other
      identifying material of family members of U.S. Air Force employees or members.
      18.6.1.4. Links to Associated Weapons Systems. Fact Sheets maintained within the
      Air Force Link Library provide basic information on aircraft and other weapons
      systems in the U.S. Air Force inventory.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                         333


     18.6.1.5. News Releases. Locally generated news releases that have been cleared for
     release to the general public.
     18.6.1.6. News Related Photos. Local photography of people and associated equipment
     help tell the unit‟s story.
     18.6.1.7. Standard Publications and Forms. Standard publications and forms that are not
     exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act.
     18.6.1.8. Links to Higher Headquarters Sites. Sites should also provide links to
     public sites belonging to higher headquarters within their organizational chain.
     18.6.1.9. Detailed Imagery. Do not include maps or aerial photography of installations
     on public Web sites.
     18.6.1.10. Mandatory Links. In an effort to promote recruiting, public Web sites should
     contain a link to the official Air Force recruiting site, http://www.airforce.com/.
  18.6.2. External Links
     18.6.2.1. Approval. The ability to hyperlink to sources external to your organization is
     a fundamental part of the Worldwide Web, and can add significant value to the
     functionality of publicly accessible Web sites. Air Force activities will establish
     objective and supportable criteria or guidelines for the selection and maintenance of
     links to external Web pages. Guidelines should consider the informational needs of
     personnel and their families, mission-related needs, and public communication and
     community relations objectives. Such guidelines must be consistent with the following
     considerations:
     18.6.2.2. Links to non-DOD Web site resources should support the organization‟s
     mission. External links should be reviewed periodically to ensure their continued
     suitability. If the content of a linked external site becomes questionable or objectionable,
     remove the link.
     18.6.2.3. In accordance with DOD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation, no product
     endorsements or preferential treatment shall be given on publicly accessible official DOD
     Web sites.
     18.6.2.4. No payment of any kind shall be accepted in exchange for a link placed on an
     organization‟s publicly accessible official DOD Web site.
     18.6.2.5. In accordance with DOD 5500.7-R, publicly accessible DOD Web sites shall
     not require or encourage users to choose any specific browser software. Only text or
     hyperlinked text shall be used to direct visitors to software download sites. Graphics or
     logos depicting companies or products shall not appear on publicly accessible DOD Web
     sites.
     18.6.2.6. Organizations will not use “frames” technology.
     18.6.2.7. Organizations are encouraged to link to authorized activities in support of the
     organization‟s mission, such as the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, the Navy
     Exchange Service Command, and the Marine Corps Exchange. If these sites contain
     commercial advertisements or sponsorships, the appropriate disclaimer shall be given.
334                                            AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


      18.6.2.8. To avoid the perception of Air Force promotion or endorsement, links to
      commercial organizations, such as (but not limited to): contractors who produce Web
      sites, non-military content providers, or event organizers and promoters, should be
      avoided. If a link to a non-government Web site is considered for placement on an Air
      Force public site, the commander of the major command, or their subordinate
      organization, is responsible for ensuring that a disclaimer is made that neither the Air
      Force nor the organization endorses the product or organization at the destination, nor
      does the Air Force exercise any responsibility over the content at the destination.
          18.6.2.8.1. A link from an Air Force public Web site should relate to the mission of
          the organization. For example, if members of an organization routinely interact
          with a defense contractor, it is permissible to point to that contractor‟s Web site.
          The link should not go to the primary home page, but specifically to the page that
          directly relates to official Air Force contracted business. Under these circumstances,
          the Air Force can place only one link to the contractor‟s site.
      18.6.2.9. Organizations must realize that once the decision is made to include a link
      to one non-DOD site from a public Web site, the organization may be required to link all
      similar sites that request links. Any appearance of impropriety could be avoided with a
      notice that indicates references to other sources within the organization‟s site do not
      constitute an official or unofficial endorsement of such sites or services and that the list
      is not necessarily all inclusive.
      18.6.2.10. Disclaimer for External Links. The disclaimer below shall be displayed when
      linking to external sites. This disclaimer may appear on the page or pages listing
      external links, or through an intermediate “exit notice“ page generated by the server
      machine whenever a request is made for any site other than an official DOD Web site
      (usually the .mil domain). An example of such an exit notice is: “The appearance of
      hyperlinks does not constitute endorsement by the U.S. Air Force of this Web site or the
      information, products or services contained therein. For other than authorized activities
      such as military exchanges and Morale, Welfare and Recreation sites, the U.S. Air
      Force does not exercise any editorial control over the information you may find at
      these locations. Such links are provided consistent with the stated purpose of this U.S.
      Air Force Web site.”
   18.6.3. Links to Restricted Sites. Air Force public Web sites will not link to restricted sites
   unavailable to the general public.
   18.6.4. Republishing of Base Newspapers on the Internet. Base newspapers are established
   according to DOD Instruction 5120.4 and AFI 35-101. Though generally public domain,
   base newspapers exist as part of the U.S. Air Force‟s internal information program. While the
   publishing of base newspapers constitutes public release of information, the distribution is
   normally limited. Web sites constitute a much broader, global release. Therefore, some
   information appropriate for base newspapers may not be appropriate for broader public
   access Web sites. The content of base newspapers may be reproduced for the Web site if
   that content meets the restrictions provided in DOD‟s Interim Policy, Web Site
   Administration Policies and Procedures (25 November 1998). All stories should be
   reviewed against Part V of the DOD policy prior to being posted to public Web sites.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                          335


   18.6.5. Point of Contact. Point of contact for each significant page is required. Use
   generic POC information, not individual e-mail addresses.
   18.6.6. Feedback. Each site must provide a means to provide feedback or request further
   information.
   18.6.7. Current as of Date. Information should be kept as current as possible.
18.7. Usability Requirements: Section 508.
   18.7.1. In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to require federal agencies
   to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with
   disabilities. Section 508, 1194.22, “Web-based Intranet and Internet information and
   applications,“ is of particular importance with regard to Web site management. This
   section outlines the requirements for federal Web sites, both Internet and Intranet. It states
   that federal Web sites must meet the needs of disabled employees and members of the public
   and allow them access to Internet technology in a format understood by software
   readers/viewers. In order to accomplish this, several simple, fundamental changes are
   required. For the entire list of requirements go to http://www.section5O8.gov. Listed are
   several of the key requirements:
      18.7.1.1. A text equivalent for every non-text element shall be provided using “alt“ text
      tags.
      18.7.1.2. Equivalent alternatives for any multimedia presentation shall be synchronized
      with the presentation.
      18.7.1.3. Web pages shall be designed so that all information conveyed with color is
      also available without color, for example from context or markup.
      18.7.1.4. Documents shall be organized so they are readable without requiring an
      associated style sheet.
      18.7.1.5. Redundant text links shall be provided for each active region of a server-
      side image map.
      18.7.1.6. Row and column headers shall be identified for data tables.
      18.7.1.7. Flash and similar graphic formats. Web sites will not contain any graphic
      format, such as Macromedia Flash, without ensuring the graphic has an alt text tag.
      18.7.1.8. Video or Sound Files. Video files should be synchronized to subtitled text
      and sound files must have a text transcript.
18.8. 1nappropriate Material and Prohibitions.
   18.8.1. The following items are inappropriate for public Web sites:
      18.8.1.1. Inappropriate Links. Air Force public Web sites will not link to offensive or
      unrelated commercial material.
      18.8.1.2. Operational and Personnel Security. No reference to any information that
      would reveal sensitive movements of military assets or personnel or the locations of
      units, installations, or personnel where uncertainty is an element of security of a military
      plan or program shall be posted to U.S. Air Force Web sites.
336                                            AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


       18.8.1.3. Personal Information. Use of personal information protected by the Privacy
       Act (AFI33-332, Privacy Act Program) is prohibited. Further restrictions on the use of
       personal information are provided by DOD policy, Web Site Administration Policies and
       Procedures, 25 November 1998.
       18.8.1.4. Copyright Information. Copyrighted material may only be used with written
       permission from the owner (see AFI 51-303, Intellectual Property—Patents, Patent
       Related Matters, Trademarks and Copyrights). United States IAWs on copyright,
       primarily 17 U.S.C. 101, et seq., preserve for the owner of copyrighted material the
       benefits and earnings to be derived from the reproduction and distribution of such
       works. Material that is subject to copyright protection includes original works of
       authorship fixed in any tangible medium, 17 U.S.C. 102(a). It is now accepted that
       computer software, sequences of code and instructions, is in fact, subject to copyright.
       18.8.1.5. Trademarks and Logos. The use of trademarks or logos is prohibited.
       18.8.1.6. Inactive or broken links. Inactive or broken links should be corrected or
       removed immediately.
       18.8.1.7. Under Construction Notices. These notices frustrate users and will not be
       used. Areas of a Web site under construction should not be linked until they are
       complete with meaningful information. Newly constructed Web sites awaiting approval
       or review should have appropriate access restrictions until testing and approval is
       obtained.
       18.8.1.8. All content used on a public Web site must be cleared for public release. Do not
       include any material that is classified, for official use only, or scientific and technical
       information that hasn‟t been cleared for public release.
18.9. Appearance. The appearance and branding of public Web sites will be standardized
through the Air Force Public Web Program. Only designs and templates approved by the Air
Force Public Web Program management team will be used. Exceptions to this policy must be
approved by SAF/PA.
18.10. Collection of 1nformation. U.S. Air Force Web sites must comply with DOD
limitations on the collection and use of user information. The use of cookies or other browser
measures to gather information on public site users beyond statistical summaries is prohibited.
Web site administrators will ensure the appropriate privacy and security notices are included or
linked to the home page.
18.11. Public Web Site Policies. A current list of policies affecting the management and
operation of public Web sites in the U.S. Air Force is maintained at
http://www.af.mil/webpolicy/. Due to the evolving nature of the Internet and technology, this
list and other instructions are frequently supplemented by policy letters, messages and other
guidance.
18.12. Web-based Message Boards, Threaded Chat Rooms and Guest Books. These
technologies allow users to post opinions, messages or information openly to a Web site. They
provide a useful means of creating two-way communication, but are prohibited as part of
public Web site services. However, such services may be appropriate for internal networks or
as part of domain-restricted Web sites. The commander assumes responsibility for the
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                     337


operation and content of those message systems. Clear guidance on the acceptable use of such
technologies must be provided and policies established that prohibit inflammatory, libelous,
pornographic or otherwise inappropriate messages.

19.1. Purpose. In accordance with DOD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, Chapter 3
and DODI 5435.2, Delegation of Authority to Approve Travel In and Use of Military Carriers
for Public Affairs Purposes. Public Affairs travel is defined as any travel or transportation of
individuals, groups, or materiel undertaken as a result of a request to or an invitation from, and
authorized by, an approving authority in the interest of adding to the public understanding of
DOD activities. It includes travel or transportation involving individuals or things, military or
civilian, government or non-government, U.S., or foreign requests. Military carriers may be
used to support travel of bona fide representatives of information media individually or in groups
in connection with assignments to cover military events, press tours, visits to military
installations, military exercises, or military operations; invitational or other authorized travel or
transportation in support of approved Public Affairs programs, including community relations
programs, tours, or conferences in which a DOD component is either a sponsor or a participant;
and tours or other Public Affairs programs arranged jointly with another Federal Department or
Agency or with a foreign government. Travel authorized for Public Affairs purposes must
reflect the following considerations:
   19.1.1. It shall not compete with U.S. flag commercial sea, land, or air transportation when
   that capability exists, is adequate, and when Public Affairs objectives may be achieved
   through use of commercial transportation.
   19.1.2. Travel or transportation for Public Affairs purposes must be determined to be
   primarily in the interest of the DOD.
   19.1.3. Travel designed solely to improve relations, increase goodwill, or serve
   humanitarian purposes does not meet the criteria for Public Affairs travel.
19.2. Eligibility.
   19.2.1. Travel.
       19.2.1.1. Bona Fide Representatives of News Media. Individually, or in groups, for
       assignments to cover military exercises or military operations.
           19.2.1.1.1. News coverage of an emergency nature where the coverage would be
           impaired or delayed, to the serious detriment of the Air Force, unless
           transportation by DOD-owned or controlled aircraft is provided. Such coverage must
           have the approval of SAF/PA.
       19.2.1.2. Individuals traveling on invitational or authorized travel in support of
       approved Public Affairs activities, including guests of the Secretary of Defense
       participating in the Joint Civilian Orientation Conference (JCOC), Air Force tours, or
       tours and activities arranged jointly with other federal government departments or
       agencies or with a foreign government.

   sleep with the unit. Media embeds are only used during contingency deployments and the
   Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs (OASD/PA) determines whether or not
   media embeds will be used. Media embed may begin from home station and may involve
   transportation to the area of responsibility (AOR). Media embed is approved and
   authorized by OASD/PA in accordance with appropriate governing Public Affairs
   guidance.

   following type flights: personnel and/or equipment airdrops; night vision goggle operations;
   transporting hazardous cargo; and flights prohibited by international agreement. Tactical
   waivers are an operations issue. Tactical waiver requests originate at the requesting wing
   operations unit and are coordinated through operational channels in accordance with AFI
   11-401, appropriate MAJCOM supplements, or AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations,
   Paragraph 3.19.

Section 19C—Overseas Travel

19.5. Overseas Travel Guidelines.
    19.5.1. General. In accordance with DOD 4500.54-G, Foreign Clearance Guide, country
    clearance is required from the American Embassy as appropriate, for personnel travel to
    that country and is granted by the American Embassy of that country. Theater clearance is
    required for visits to overseas military activities on matters pertaining to the mission of the
    combatant command and is granted by the combatant command. It generally requires at
    least 30 days notice; travel to some countries may require more time. By exception, short-
    notice trips can be accomplished, however these exceptions require no less than MAJCOM
    level endorsement and/or sponsorship. Many organizations associated with the embassy and
    combatant command have a vested interest in media travel and will provide clearance
    input based on real world events and activities. See Figure 19.1
    19.5.2. Responsibilities.
       19.5.2.1. Requesting organization will submit a formal request for country/theater
       clearance through the MAJCOM/PA. MAJCOMs can only process theater clearances;
       the U.S. Embassy in each country that a group will land in must provide country
       clearances. Travel without country clearances is illegal. See DOD 4500.54-G for
       specific message address and time requirements. (see Figure 19.2).
       19.5.2.2. Requesting organization will provide invitational travel orders when final
       operational and Public Affairs approval is received (see Figure 19.2).
       19.5.2.3. Requesting organization will work through owning MAJCOM to obtain
       current guidance on media ground rules for the destination AOR.
       19.5.2.4. Requesting organization will ensure travelers obtain passports and visas, are
       in good physical condition, obtain required immunizations, and sign ground rules (See
       Figure 19.3) and a hold harmless agreement prior to departure. Travelers are responsible
       for carrying their own personal and professional equipment.
       19.5.2.5. Failure to have required documentation or any violation of the ground rules
       may be the basis for terminating a media representative‟s travel status.
    19.5.3. Request Procedures.
    19.5.4. Requestor. Prepare country/theater clearance message in accordance with DOD
    4500.54-G (Figure 19.1). Message must include reason for media travel; names, social
    security numbers and passport numbers of the media representatives and Public Affairs
    escort; media affiliation; an outline of the travel plan, and an outline of the Public Affairs
    plan for the media in the AOR.
       19.5.4.1. Requesting organization must obtain owning wing and NAF/CC operational
       approval through appropriate channels prior to forwarding country/theater request to
       MAJCOM/PA.

        19.5.4.2. MAJCOM/PA reviews requests within the context of other similar requests
        and then submits country/theater clearance request to combatant commanders, affected
        American embassies, SAF/PAM, and all intermediate and interested headquarters and
        units in accordance with DOD 4500.54-G.
        19.5.4.3. MAJCOM/PA is responsible for submitting operational approval request to
        MAJCOM owning affected aircraft.
        19.5.4.4. After obtaining country/theater clearance and operational approval,
        MAJCOM/PA forwards request to SAF/PA who then forwards to OASD/PA for final
        approval.
        19.5.4.5. Upon receipt of OASD/PA approval, SAF/PA forwards completed package to
        originator through appropriate channels.
    19.5.5. Overseas Deployments and Major Exercises. Instead of processing numerous
    individual requests for overseas travel for media covering deployments and major
    exercises, sponsoring MAJCOMs may request one-time authority from OASD/PA (through
    SAF/PA) to approve travel aboard aircraft supporting or participating in the exercise or
    deployment. All media travel in conjunction with a deployment must be coordinated with
    the gaining combatant command and media must have appropriate passports and visas.
    19.5.6. Reporting Requirements. Requesters must prepare and submit a media memo input
    to SAF/ PAM via MAJCOM/PA no later than the morning media travel begins. Include a
    list of media and their affiliations; trip itinerary, including significant interviews, briefings,
    or events to be observed; and type of coverage anticipated, including specific details for
    when resulting stories will be published/aired.

 Section 19D—Media Travel

 19.6. Objective. Media travel is one of the Air Force‟s most credible Public Affairs tools.
 Properly planned and coordinated, a media travel project can dramatically expand a media
 representative‟s understanding of the Air Force‟s mission, equipment and people. Most media
 travel requests will be for air transportation and this section will only address policies and
 procedures related to air transportation. DOD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility,
 authorizes media travel aboard DOD-owned aircraft. Do not commit Air Force transportation
 prior to obtaining approval from proper authorities. The categories of media travel are local,
 non-local and overseas. Media travel on an Air Force aircraft must be integral to the news
 coverage to be developed, such as in demonstrating Air Force capability or to convey or enhance
 an Air Force position. Air Force transportation must not compete with commercial carriers and
 will not be used to provide point-to-point travel if the trip is available from a commercial
 carrier with the same result. (See 19.4.7. for tactical waiver flights).

                       OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM
            MEDIA TRAVEL VIA MILITARY AIRLIFT FROM UNITED STATES


Transportation can be provided, on a space available basis, however, no guarantees of travel or
travel dates can be made. You must be prepared for the possibility of return to the U.S. via
commercial carrier at your own expense, and should plan accordingly. Additionally, return
flights may not come back to your U.S. embarkation point. In other words, you may have to get
home on your own.
 352                                             AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


Travel on Air Mobility Command aircraft is solely for the purpose of demonstrating the
command‟s global mobility mission to the media. Media who only want transport to the area must
make commercial arrangements.


News media representatives (NMRs) must follow Public Affairs instructions at all times.
Filming and interviewing crewmembers during the flight will be at the discretion of the aircraft
commander. NMRs will fasten seat belts during takeoffs and landings and observe all safety
regulations. NOTE: if you break away from your escort/group at any time while in theater, AMC
cannot accept further responsibility for your logistics arrangements or return travel to the United
States.


Media must agree in advance not to remove camera equipment or recording devices from aircraft,
report/ record or use cameras at the mid-east transshipment staging points due to security
reasons. You must agree to follow PA instructions at all times. Media may be required to
remain in the immediate vicinity of the aircraft during offload operations. Depending on
location, communications may be limited while in AOR; plan to file story after return.


All host nation requirements must be met by media, i.e. passports, visas, inoculations, etc. It
is the media‟s responsibility to request and obtain documents through the embassy or
consulate serving the area.


It‟s possible no government meals, lodging, or ground transportation will be provided.
Media are responsible for paying for their own hotels, meals and any other expense they incur.
Hotel rooms are difficult to come by and estimated to be between $100-150 per night. You are
limited to 140 pounds of personal effects and equipment. Current temperatures are cool and
conditions are austere. Please dress accordingly.


Each traveler must provide the information on the bottom of this page to 436th AW/PA as
soon as possible. Your signature indicates your agreement to adhere to the guidelines listed
above. If you have questions, contact us at 123-456-7890. Once you complete the form, fax
it to Capt Robert Smith at

 Section 19E—Non-media Public Affairs Travel
354                                             AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009


19.8. Objective. The purpose of Public Affairs travel is to further public understanding of Air
Force missions, people, and weapons systems and to develop Air Force advocates who will
carry the Air Force story to non-traditional as well as traditional audiences. Authority for Public
Affairs travel is contained in DOD 4515.13R, Chapter 3 and DODI 5435.2. No authority exists
for approval of public affairs travel on a flight during a record attempt, a first flight of an
aircraft just accepted into the inventory, a first flight over an isolated geographical area, or any
other flight of a similar or special nature, where abnormal conditions may exist. (See 19.3.6 for
tactical waiver requirements)
19.9. Eligibility. Individuals who, because of position and contacts with various public
organizations, can make positive contributions to public understanding of the roles and
missions of the Department of Defense.
19.10. Approval Authority. See Table 19.1
19.11. Procedures.
   19.11.1. Participants should be selected and invited as part of an overall Public Affairs
   strategy to increase public understanding and support of the roles and missions of the
   Department of Defense, Department of the Air Force, or a local installation.
   19.11.2. Wing/PAs are responsible for providing a comprehensive list of proposed invitees
   and submitting it to the wing commander for final approval prior to sending invitations.
      19.11.3. Orders
         19.11.3.1. There is no requirement for invitational travel orders if the flight is “around
         the flag pole,“ however Wing/PA is responsible for providing required information for
         the manifest.
         19.11.3.2. When the travel is local (with stops) or non-local, participants must travel
         on invitational travel orders, but at no cost to the government (no Line Of
         Authorization required on the orders).
   19.11.4. Submit an after-action report to MAJCOM/PA to include date, type of aircraft,
   itinerary, and names of participants.

Section 19F—Air Force Tour Program

19.12. General Guidelines. The Air Force Tour Program increases community leaders‟
awareness and understanding of the Air Force‟s role in national security by inviting groups of
civilian opinion leaders to witness the Air Force mission by visiting Air Force installations. Air
Force units carefully select candidates who are capable of disseminating information to various
publics about the Air Force‟s programs. Participants may travel on Air Force aircraft to view
the Air Force in action in accordance with Chapter 8 of this AFI, DOD Regulation 4515.13R,
DODI 5435.2, and DOD 5410.19.
19.13. Funding. MAJCOM and other authorized sponsors are responsible for budgeting and
funding Air Force Tour Program airlift support. Fiscal year funds should be requested through
the appropriate MAJCOM budgeting process.
AFI35-101_934AWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                            355


   19.13.1. IAW AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement, Public Affairs travel is supported as a
   special assignment airlift mission (SAAM). Commands are charged according to current
   hourly rates and type of aircraft.
   19.13.2. Air Force Tour Program airlift mission requests must include a fund cite prior to
   submitting to MAJCOM for validation. Each sponsor will request validation through their
   MAJCOM/PA. MAJCOM/PA will staff as appropriate within their command.
   19.13.3. SAF/PA will request and monitor funds through HQ AMC/PA for DOD, Air Staff,
   Secretariat, and Bolling AFB‟s 11th Wing-sponsored tours.
   19.13.4. IAW AFI 24-101, AMC will, in coordination with the Chicago field office, budget
   funds for SAF/PA Air Force Tour Program via the program objective memorandum (POM)
   process.
19.14. Airlift Requirements.
   19.14.1. MAJCOM validators must submit requests to USTRANSCOM no later than 60 days
   prior to the event; 30 days if request includes contact information for a unit willing to
   volunteer to support.
   19.14.2. Requests must include special requirements such as airline style, seating, comfort
   pallets, etc. Note: Not all aircraft can accommodate “comfort pallets“ and not all units can
   provide sufficient airline-style seating for all passengers.
   19.14.3. Although sponsors may request passenger configured aircraft, the participants will
   experience a more meaningful view of Air Force crewmember travel if they fly on cargo-
   configured aircraft.
   19.14.4. Sponsors are encouraged to request a refueling mission on one leg of the trip. Air
   refueling is a unique Air Force operation demonstrating the capabilities of our systems and
   the professionalism of our people.
19.15. Orientation Flights. Although orientation flights outlined in DOD 4515.13R, Chapter
4, are not directly related to Public Affairs, Public Affairs offices are often tasked to coordinate
such flights. Wing PAs should be familiar with categories of eligible passengers as well as
specific requirements (see AFI 11-401, Table 1.1 for all other orientation flights).
