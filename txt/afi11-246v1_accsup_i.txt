SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This Interim Change (IC) alters the sequence of the A-10 demonstration profile, makes minor
changes to several maneuver airspeed parameters, and converts the single aileron roll to a double
aileron roll. Additionally, changes to the F-16 Spiral Descent maneuver description and
parameters are included. Also, the IC makes changes to the sequence of the F-15E Strike Eagle
demonstration profile, reorients the LAHD bomb pass maneuver, and includes minor maneuver
parameter changes.

(ACC) This interim change implements new guidelines for military Heritage Flight (HF) pilots
not trained as single-ship aircraft demonstration pilots and makes substantial changes to the
implementation processes for the USAF Heritage Flight Program (USAFHFP). A margin bar (|)
indicates newly revised material.

                               OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.1. Introduction. USAF uses single-ship aerial demonstration teams to exhibit the capabilities
of modern high performance USAF aircraft and the degree of skill required to operate and
maintain these aircraft. ACC is designated lead command and will establish standard criteria for
single-ship aerial demonstrations of the A-10, F-15, F-16, F-22 aircraft and the Heritage Flight
program. MAJCOMs interested in developing future airshow programs involving these AF MDS
aircraft will be governed by this instruction and approved MAJCOM supplements. This
instruction provides specific maneuvers, sequences, and parameters governing the execution of
these demonstrations. Other MAJCOMs flying single-ship aerial demonstrations of these MDS
aircraft will comply with this instruction. Policy and procedures for team management, selection,
training, and scheduling will be in accordance with (IAW) applicable MAJCOM supplements.

AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                           19


     specific instructions as to what all will be authorized for reimbursement (airfare or other
     transportation, car rental, lodging, per diem, etc, as applicable). Prior coordination with
     ACC/A3TA is required before deviating from funding instructions or exceeding the
     maximum funding authorized. Unauthorized expenditures and/or deviations are a wing
     responsibility. Examples of unplanned reimbursable expenses: fighter or tanker breaks
     and the team stays longer; a divert en route to/from the show; scheduled bus
     transportation inadequate and team needs to rent cars. Non-reimbursable expenses
     include payment for shipment of maintenance parts; customs charges etc. (Note: ACC
     will not fund lodging or transportation for any OCONUS air show, except air and trade
     shows, IAW DoDI 5410.19 paragraphs E.2.1.1 and E.3.5.3.1 Responsibility for
     funding lodging and local transportation belongs to the OCONUS air show.) There are
     two ways a demonstration team can be tasked to deploy to support an OCONUS air
     show:
        1.4.3.4.1. (Added-ACC) Teams deploying OCONUS to fly aircraft already in place:
        Teams tasked to deploy to an OCONUS air show (other than their first two Canadian
        airshows) and fly another MAJCOM's jets or fly another ACC unit's jets that are
        already in place for an exercise or other event, will receive ACC funding for all
        personnel travel costs not covered by the airshow for the demonstration crew, one
        safety observer, a narrator and four support personnel. Send requests to take
        additional personnel to ACC/A3TA with justification. (Examples where additional
        personnel may be required: The demonstration crew has to ferry the other
        MAJCOM's aircraft to and/or from the show and demonstration team maintainers are
        required to launch and recover the jets at the home station as well as at the show site;
        the demonstration pilot has to stage the demonstration from other than the show site;
        or the demonstration team is supporting one OCONUS show after another). Funding
        guidelines and unplanned mission delays will be handled IAW paragraph 1.4.3.4
        above.
        1.4.3.4.2. (Added-ACC) Teams deploying OCONUS with their own jets: Teams
        tasked to deploy with their own jets to an OCONUS air show (other than their first
        two Canadian shows), must develop their own deployment package (Demonstration
        team plus augmentation, if required) and forward it to ACC/A3TA for review. After
        ACC approves the deployment package and commits demonstration team support to
        the show, ACC/A3TA will provide the wing with a fund cite authorization
        memorandum. Funding guidelines and unplanned mission delays will be handled
        IAW paragraph 1.4.3.4 above.
        1.4.3.4.3. (Added-ACC) Teams supporting airshows in foreign countries must
        submit their narration to the host MAJCOM/PA and the applicable embassy for
        review. Expect changes will be made to ensure appropriate verbiage is used.
        1.4.3.4.4. (Added-ACC) After a demonstration team has had its narration reviewed
        for use at a foreign airshow (See paragraph 1.4.3.4.3), teams must ascertain if the
        narration needs to be translated into a foreign language. If so, they must coordinate
        the translation through ACC/A3TA or with the host embassy.
     1.4.3.5. Prepares waiver recommendations for HQ ACC/A3 approval.

     1.4.8.6. Review and grade the HUD tape (if available) and ground video of every
     practice and demonstration using the grade sheets per paragraph 1.11, obtain ground
     safety observer review, and forward to the reviewing officer IAW paragraph 1.4.5.8.
     During training/non-airshow season, upgrading demo pilots will place all grade sheets in
     their grade book and will forward all HUD or ground tapes for wing leadership review.
     After MAJCOM/CC certification, demo pilots will begin forwarding the grade sheet and
     the HUD or ground tape IAW paragraph 1.4.6.4 of this instruction, including those
     occurring during training/non-airshow season in-between the demo pilotâ€™s first and
     second year.
     1.4.8.6. (ACC) When HUD is not available, the demo pilot and safety observer will
     complete the grade sheet from memory as soon as possible after landing. During the air
     show season, at least every 90 days, actual HUD recording is required for grade sheet
     completion.
     1.4.8.7. Individual Responsibility. Each member assigned to the MAJCOM Single-
     Ship Demonstration Team must fully understand the solemn trust and special obligation
     that accompanies a position on the demonstration team. Individual behavior, bearing, and
     appearance shape not only the team image but also public image of the USAF. First
     among the teamâ€™s many responsibilities is the safety of demonstration audiences. There
     can be no aspect of any team memberâ€™s life style or daily conduct that would in any way
     impair the teamâ€™s performance or jeopardize public safety. Each member must be at the
     peak of physical and mental capabilities for all demonstration team activities. In addition,
     given the continuous rigor of the demonstration team schedule, each member must be
     able to sustain this mental and physical capability level over an extended period of time.
     The key to this sustained performance is the establishment of a personal daily regimen to
     include regular eating, hydration, adequate sleeping, and proper exercise habits, which
     will minimize the adverse effects of continuous travel, cultural/dietary differences, and
     time zone changes.
     1.4.8.7. (ACC) Individual Responsibility. This paragraph and its subparagraphs apply
     fully to the USAFHFP pilots and support personnel.
24                                              AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011


         1.4.8.7.1. In view of the special obligations incumbent whether performing in the air
         or providing ground support, each member of the team, will adhere to the following
         policies: In no case will the provisions of AFI 11-202 Vol 3, General Flight Rules,
         concerning the consumption of alcoholic beverages be violated. Additionally,
         alcoholic beverages will not be consumed later than 12 hours prior to reporting for
         duty when aerobatic maneuvers are scheduled for the following day. For cross-
         country flights not involving aerobatic maneuvers, the provisions of AFI 11-202 Vol
         3 apply. Although the provisions of this policy do not quantify the maximum amount
         of alcohol permitted to be consumed, the intent, in concert with a daily regimen and
         peak daily mental and physical capability, mandates the highest individual
         responsibility and moderation with the fullest recognition of the next dayâ€™s duties and
         obligations.
         1.4.8.7.2. Lifestyle and daily activities, on and off duty, will be governed by the need
         to minimize personal risk and totally avoid any display of reckless behavior.
         Activities that could result in personal injury or jeopardize availability for team
         activities are inappropriate for team members. Although each demonstration team
         activity deserves special attention, those involving demanding flight operations
         unique to the air demonstration mission, specifically aerobatic maneuvers, whether
         for practice or official demonstration, are the most critical.
     1.4.8.8. (Added-ACC) Attendance at USAF meetings/Forums (e.g. media training, New
     Demonstration Pilot Orientation Course, ACC Forum, etc.) is mandatory for all
     demonstration aircrews (both current and outgoing), team NCOICs, and the outgoing and
     newly selected military HF pilots. These meetings are held during the International
     Council of Airshows (ICAS) convention.
     1.4.8.9. (Added-ACC) AFHFF pilots must adhere to all applicable FAA regulations.
     Any deviations may result in decertification IAW paragraph 2.5.20 (Added).
  1.4.9. Demonstration team ground safety observers:
     1.4.9.1. Complete safety observer training and documentation per paragraph 2.5.
     1.4.9.2. Monitor all practices and demonstrations with maneuvers conducted below
     2,000 feet AGL.
     1.4.9.3. Maintain two-way radio communication with the demonstration pilot, monitor
     demonstration pilot altitude and airspeed radio calls, and direct maneuver abort if outside
     prescribed parameters.
     1.4.9.4. Monitor the demonstration for potential hazards (e.g., flocks of birds,
     unscheduled aircraft, weather).
     1.4.9.5. Critique each maneuver and note needed improvements in the performance.
     However, in no case should critiquing maneuvers take precedence over monitoring the
     safe accomplishment of maneuvers.
     1.4.9.6. Review the HUD tape or ground video and grade sheet of every practice and
     demonstration.
  1.4.10. (Added-ACC) Military Heritage Flight pilots will:

       show performance. If not able, a minimum of 10 minutes of formation flight at the show
       site with all planned HF performers will be required. Practice in the formation position
       planned for the event performance. If you have not flown a practice profile or 10 minutes
       of formation flight with the HF performers, contact your group commander for an
       operations risk management (ORM) discussion and approval (INFO ACC/A3TA). For
       HF flyovers (non-air show), plan for a minimum of 10 minutes formation practice.
1.5. Requests and Approval.

1.9. Reporting.
1.9. (ACC)Reporting. This paragraph and its subparagraphs apply fully to the military HF
pilots.
   1.9.1. The pilot, narrator, ground safety observer, or NCOIC will transmit via phone, fax, or
   email a post-demonstration report to the MAJCOM Aerial Events office after each dayâ€™s
   scheduled public demonstration. As a minimum, include:
       1.9.1.1. Weather (if a factor).
       1.9.1.2. Show profile.
       1.9.1.3. Estimated crowd count.
       1.9.1.4. Unusual occurrences/remarks.
       1.9.1.5. Any report with an unusual occurrence or area with an unsatisfactory from

AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                          29


       1.10.1.1. Any demo team wishing to perform new maneuvers not outlined in this
       instruction will submit a detailed description of the maneuver, parameters, and abort
       procedures to ACC/A3TA for coordination and the WG/CC for approval to practice. New
       maneuvers will be developed by the demo pilot and evaluated in the simulator prior to
       flight. Once parameters have been established and the maneuver has been flown
       satisfactorily in the simulator, demo pilots will fly and evaluate maneuvers in working
       airspace above 5,000â€™ AGL and then above 2,000â€™ AGL. Once safety evaluation has been
       accomplished in working airspace, demo pilots will fly the maneuver over the airfield at
       or above 1,000â€™ AGL and again at 500â€™ AGL, prior to flying the maneuver at maneuver
       minimums. All maneuver evaluations will be documented on a gradesheet and
       maintained in the demo pilotâ€™s gradebook as well as sent to MAJCOM. Once the
       maneuver is perfected in practice, a change to this AFI will be submitted IAW para
       1.10.1. Demo pilots will not perform new maneuvers in actual demonstrations unless
       approved by MAJCOM/CC.
   1.10.2. Each demonstration team may supplement this instruction as necessary. Team
   organization, maintenance support, selection criteria, and training programs for new pilots
   are examples of items that may be supplemented. Submit supplements to HQ ACC/A3TA for
   coordination prior to publication and forward one copy to HQ USAF/A3O-AO after
   publication.
1.11. Demonstration Performance Reviews/Grade Sheets.
   1.11.1. Every practice and demonstration will be recorded on the pilotâ€™s HUD tape. Every
   practice and demonstration involving aerobatics of any kind conducted below 2,000 feet
   AGL will be videotaped. Each demonstration will be debriefed using these videotapes.
   Demonstration pilots will use the approved Microsoft Excel grade sheet to evaluate each
   flight. MAJCOM/CC or A3 may request a videotape and HUD tape for review at any time
   during the air show season. Demonstration teams will maintain videotapes, HUD tapes, and
   completed grade sheets for a minimum of one year. Approved grade sheets will be provided
   by ACC/A3TA.
1.11.1. (ACC) Approved Grade Sheet master files will be maintained and distributed by A3TA.
Grade sheets must reflect the HF pilot's name and type aircraft flown, as well as other ACC
pilots and aircraft flown, in that order.

   1.11.2. Each maneuver will be graded using a scale of 0 to 4 and averaged to compute an
   overall demonstration grade of 0 to 4. Wing reviewers must comment and make
   recommendations on any maneuver graded zero (0). A maneuver grade of 0 should not be
   automatically considered dangerous unless the manner in which the maneuver was performed
   created a safety of flight situation. However, if safety is compromised then the overall
   demonstration grade will be zero (0). Wing reviewers will recommend additional training for
   any overall demonstration graded zero (0). The average grade for a typical air show should
   be a two (2). The grade sheets will reflect altitude and airspeed to the greatest accuracy
   possible. The following grading criteria will be used to establish individual maneuver and
   overall demonstration grades.
       1.11.2.1. To compute the maneuver grade, "X" equals the distance between the target
       and minimum altitudes. As an example, if the target altitude is 6,000 feet and the
30                                             AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011


     minimum altitude is 5,000 feet then "X" equals 1000 feet and 1/2X equals 500 feet.
     Grade 0 would be given for all altitudes below 5,000 feet; Grade 1 for all altitudes from
     5,000 to 5,499 feet; Grade 2 for all altitudes 5,500 to 5,999 feet and above 6,501 feet;
     Grade 3 for all altitudes from 6,001 to 6,500 feet; and Grade 4 if altitude equals 6,000
     feet. (Figure 1.1).
     1.11.2.2. GRADE 0 â€“ Altitude below minimum, or airspeed out of limits.
     1.11.2.3. GRADE 1 â€“ Altitude >1/2X below target, and airspeed within limits.
     1.11.2.4. GRADE 2 â€“ Altitude <1/2X below target or >1/2X above target, and airspeed
     within limits.
     1.11.2.5. GRADE 3 â€“ Altitude <1/2X above target, and airspeed +/- 25 knots of target.
     1.11.2.6. GRADE 4 â€“ Altitude on target, and airspeed +/- 10 knots of target.
     1.11.2.7. Airspeed criteria do not apply to the A-10 unless airspeed is below minimum
     parameter; the maneuver grade is zero.
     1.11.2.8. OVERALL GRADE = Computed average of the maneuver scores.
  0 = Dangerous performance
  1 = Safe performance, but trend is low
  2 = Average performance
  3 = Outstanding performance
  4 = Perfect performance; no deviations
  1.11.3. Refer to paragraph 1.4.6.4 for wing and HHQ grade sheet and tape review
  requirements.
AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                            31


Figure 1.1. Grading Ranges.




1.12. Proficiency Requirements. To maintain currency, each pilot will fly a minimum of one
demonstration every 15-calendar days. A practice session or actual demonstration will be
scheduled at least once per week during air show season. If the 15 calendar days currency is
exceeded, the next demonstration will be limited to no-lower-than 1000 feet AGL target and 900
feet AGL minimum on all maneuvers, and the operations group commander, deputy operations
group commander, or WG/CC designee must be present. MAJCOMs may determine additional
procedures for pilots to regain currency.
1.12. (ACC) Proficiency Requirements. Demonstration practices should include the less
frequently flown low and flat profiles. A minimum of one low and flat profile will be flown
every 45 days. A minimum of one HF performance is required every 45 days for military HF
pilots, and every 90 days for AFHFF pilots to maintain currency. ACC/A3TA will ensure HF
pilots are current on all requirements at least 14 days prior to the scheduled HF performance. If
noncurrent, in addition to the required HF formation practice, military HF pilots must review HF
Academics and document in the remarks section of the student activity record. Conduct and
document training sortie IAW paragraph 2.5.16 HF pilots must forward training sortie
documentation to A3TA.
1.13. Termination Procedures. Demonstrations involving aerobatics flown below 2,000 feet
AGL will be terminated when:
   1.13.1. The safety observer is unable to monitor the safe performance of maneuvers.
   1.13.2. Two-way radio communication is lost between the demonstration pilot and safety
   observer.
   1.13.3. Videotaping is lost.
 32                                                AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011


   1.13.4. Any time when in the judgment of the pilot or safety observer the safety of the pilot
   or spectators is compromised.
1.14. Transition During Performance. Each demonstration should be planned to fly a
complete high, low, or flat show profile. However, conditions such as scattered clouds in the
show area may require the demonstration pilot to transition between show profiles at certain
transition points.
1.14. (ACC) Transition During Performance. Demonstration pilots will not transition
between profiles more than once.
1.15. Altimeter Procedures. It is essential that each demonstration pilot be able to quickly and
accurately assess actual altitude above the ground during any maneuver in the demonstration. To
avoid the mental exercise required to subtract an odd-numbered field elevation from the MSL
altimeter reading to get above ground altitude, one of the two procedures described below will be
used to "zero the altimeters" (QFE). These procedures will be used for all practice and actual
demonstrations whether flown from takeoff at the show site or takeoff from a deployed location.
   1.15.1. Zero Altimeter Method. Dial aircraft altimeter until indicator reads "0". This
   method will be used if possible.
   1.15.2. Nearest 1,000 Feet Method. If it is not possible to zero the altimeter, dial the
   altimeter to the current altimeter setting for the field, then round up or down to the most
   appropriate 1,000 feet corrected field elevation (500 round down, 501 round up).
1.16. Communication Procedures. The demonstration pilot and safety observer will operate
on a discrete frequency during all practice and official demonstrations. This is to minimize the
amount of third-party radio chatter that can distract the demo pilot and step on required radio
calls from the pilot and safety observer during the demonstration. The safety observer will be the
only person in direct contact with the demo pilot. As such, all other parties must coordinate
through the safety observer for any information needed regarding the demo pilot or the
demonstration. To ensure communications with the appropriate controlling agency (tower or air
boss), the safety observer will monitor the appropriate control frequency. If the safety observer is
engaged in a protracted conversation with the controlling agency that prevents the safety
observer from devoting 100% attention to the primary duty of visually and aurally monitoring
the demonstration, the safety observer will terminate the demonstration. Once the situation has
been resolved and the safety observer can once again give the demonstration 100% attention, the
demonstration may continue. These procedures do not pertain to Heritage Flight formation
performances.
1.17. Use of Teams for Static Display. The demonstration pilot and narrator/ground safety
observer should normally arrive in two aircraft with one to be used as a spare for the
demonstration. MAJCOMs may determine if second aircraft can be used as static if spare is not
required. This may be verbally delegated to the demo team on a case by case basis.
1.17. (ACC) Use of Teams for Static Display. Neither aircraft will be scheduled for static
display purposes. This applies to both demonstration and HF-only teams. Demonstration Teams
may agree with air show directors to support a static display provided it poses no threat to the
accomplishment of the mission. Under no circumstances will a demonstration be flown without
a spare aircraft for the purposes of supporting a static display.
AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                              33


1.18. Disbursement of Demonstration Team Funds. Per MAJCOM supplement.
1.18. (ACC) Disbursement of Demonstration or HF Team Funds. The wing commander is
responsible for funding their assigned ACC Single-Ship demonstration or HF team as part of the
wingâ€™s overall financial planning process. Wings will plan IAW paragraph 1.4.5.7 Mission
required funding requests will be worked through the wingâ€™s FM office to ACC/FM, info
ACC/A3R and ACC/A3TA. Periodically (Pending availability of funds) ACC/A3 may provide
funding to demonstration or HF teams for audiovisual and other equipment required by this
Supplement or the AFI. The demonstration teams and HF teams are responsible for maintenance
and upkeep costs of equipment provided by ACC, to include purchasing new equipment if their
equipment is lost, broken or stolen.
1.19. Shortened/Modified Demonstrations. On occasion, certain air or trade shows may
require that a demonstration pilot fly a shortened or modified show, due to the time constraints
applicable to the show. MAJCOMs must consider the level of importance of participating in the
show, the anticipated recruiting value, and the complexity involved in shortening a
demonstration profile to determine the cost/benefit of attending the show. Further consideration
should be given to demo pilot proficiency and experience level. A profile may be shortened by
removing, or knocking-off the last few maneuvers. A profile may be modified by removing
maneuvers throughout the profile, but maintaining the sequential flow of the remaining
maneuvers. In no case will a demo pilot fly a shortened or modified profile when request is made
upon arrival at the show site. Four weeks notice is required from show POCs for a shortened or
modified profile to be considered, and the show POC will notify the team of the allotted
performance time. The demo pilot will shorten or modify the profile to fit in the allotted time by
removing certain maneuvers, but the maneuvers must flow in the same sequence as the full
profile. Demo pilots will submit a modified profile through command aerial events to
MAJCOM/A3 for approval NLT three weeks prior to the show. (OCONUS MAJCOM/A3s
(PACAF) may delegate the approval authority for modified profiles no lower than WG/CC.
Include delegation of approval authority in the MAJCOM supplement to AFI 11-246, Vol. 1.)
Demo pilots are required to practice within ten working days prior to the show both shortened
and modified profiles at least once. OG/CC or higher will monitor the practice to note safety
considerations and listen to the narration.
1.20. (Added-ACC) HF Procedures: Flights are scheduled per paragraph 1.6.7 (Added).
HF maneuvers are performed IAW chapter 9 (Added).
   1.20.1. (Added-ACC) HF Formation Restrictions. Recommended radio communication
   plan is per USAF Heritage Flight Briefing Guide provided by A3TA.
       1.20.1.1. (Added-ACC) Four-ship maximum in fingertip, route, echelon, or diamond
       formation. A practice four-ship formation HF must be accomplished at the show site
       prior to flying the profile in front of the public. If the situation will not allow a full
       practice, as a minimum the practice may be accomplished while in holding or enroute to
       the flyover.
       1.20.1.2. (Added-ACC) A two-ship formation "Cross-over" break may be performed
       only with the warbird aircraft in the lead. The ACC pilot will ensure no less than 50 feet
       nose-tail horizontal separation and ensure no less than 25 feet vertical separation prior to
       calling â€•Twoâ€™s clear".
34                                                AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011


     1.20.1.3. (Added-ACC) A three-ship may perform the over-the-crowd pass, but without
     a crossover break. A three-ship may accomplish a split, followed by simultaneous rolls
     inside the aerobatic box. In this case, lead should accomplish the pull straight ahead.
     Another option after the over-the-crowd pass is to bring the formation up initial in three-
     ship echelon.
     1.20.1.4. (Added-ACC) A four-ship may accomplish the over-the-crowd pass, but
     without a crossover break. The formation should be in echelon if accomplishing a pitch
     to downwind, or continuing to report initial. A four-ship may accomplish a split,
     followed by simultaneous rolls inside the aerobatic box. If accomplished, the split and
     rolls will be thoroughly briefed.
     1.20.1.5. (Added-ACC) HF Cross Country Procedures. USAFHFP pilots are
     authorized to fly cross country together provided the following items are accomplished:
     a. The flight will remain VMC at all times. b. Pilots will thoroughly brief the mission
     using the USAF Heritage Flight Dissimilar Formation Briefing Guide and applicable Air
     Force Instructions. c. Visual signals will be thoroughly briefed in the event of radio
     failure.
     1.20.1.6. (Added-ACC) At air shows and open houses, if the scheduled warbird falls
     out, military HF pilots are authorized to fly three of the Standard Air Show Flyover
     Profiles (solo) IAW paragraphs 9.2.1 and 9.2.2 If the scheduled warbird falls out at a
     non-airshow event (sports, ceremonies), military pilots are authorized to fly the scheduled
     event (2-ship max).
  1.20.2. (Added-ACC) Minimum HF performance altitudes are 200 feet AGL (target 300
  feet AGL) over a show-line environment (lead aircraft is the determining factor for 200 feet
  AGL), otherwise 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within 2,000 feet. Minimum altitude
  for the optional Flyby pass is 300 feet AGL. Minimum altitude for the Over-the-crowd pass
  over the primary spectator area at an Open House/Air Show is 500 feet above the highest
  obstacle within 2,000 feet.
  1.20.3. (Added-ACC) In-flight photography of HFs requires ACC/A3 approval.
  1.20.4. (Added-ACC) Prior to each HF, a briefing will include all items covered in the
  Heritage Flight Dissimilar Formation Briefing Guide at Attachment 6 (Added). All HFs
  will be debriefed. The most senior demonstration pilot (determined by time as a HF pilot,
  then date of rank) will be the flight lead. If no demonstration pilot is available, then the most
  senior military HF pilot (determined by time as HF pilot, then date of rank) will be the flight
  lead. The flight lead is responsible for the safe conduct of the flight, and does not necessarily
  lead the formation. Additionally, the flight lead will ensure all HF participants both civilian
  and military project the highest professional standards of the USAF.
  1.20.5. (Added-ACC) Fly a practice flight on-site at each air show location prior to
  performing before an audience. This is a mandatory requirement. If the situation will not
  allow a full practice HF routine (all 3 passes), as a minimum the practice must include at
  least 10 minutes formation flight with all HF performers in their planned positions. This may
  be accomplished while in holding or enroute to the flyover.

        DEMONSTRATION TEAM PERSONNEL SELECTION AND TRAINING

2.1. General. MAJCOMs will provide team description and location via supplement. A
standard team includes two aircraft, one demonstration pilot, a minimum of two narrators, two
safety observers, and necessary support personnel. Team will deploy with a ground safety
observer. Ground safety observers will not simultaneously perform narration duties. Team
selection should consider factors affecting assignment stability such as vulnerability for schools
or overseas assignment.
2.1. (Added-ACC)General. ACC has the following single-ship aerial demonstration and
military HF teams. All teams will include two aircraft:
   2.1.1. (Added-ACC) A-10 East at Moody AFB, GA. (HF only)
   2.1.2. (Added-ACC) A-10 West at Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ. (HF only)
   2.1.3. (Added-ACC) F-16 East at Shaw AFB, SC. (HF only)
   2.1.4. (Added-ACC) F-16 West at Hill AFB, UT. (HF only)
   2.1.5. (Added-ACC) DELETED.
   2.1.6. (Added-ACC) F-22 at Langley AFB, VA. (Demo & HF)
   2.1.7. (Added-ACC) F-4 East at Tyndall AFB, FL. (HF only).
   2.1.8. (Added-ACC) F-4 West at Holloman AFB, NM. (HF only).
2.2. Demonstration Pilot Selection. New demonstration pilots will normally be selected by
Wing Commanders in August and enter training no later than September prior to the new pilotâ€™s
first air show season. Demonstration pilot duty is normally a two-year assignment.
2.2. (ACC)Demonstration and Military HF Pilot Selection. Single-ship Demonstration pilots
will have no additional duties during the air show season. Military HF pilots are normally
selected by the Wing Commander in September and are encouraged to receive training during
the Fall prior to the new air show season. The tour of duty will normally begin with the HFTC
and continue for one year.
2.3. Narrator/Ground Safety Observer Selection.
   2.3.1. Narrators will be selected by the wing commander. To reduce the impact on flying
   operations by minimizing the number of pilots per TDY, consideration should be given to
   select non-rated officers or NCOs as the narrator. The narrator tour of duty is a minimum of
   one year.
   2.3.2. Ground safety observers must be rated officers current and qualified in the MDS.
   Ground safety observers will be selected by wing commanders during training season for
   upgrade training in preparation for the following air show season. Demo teams will be
   limited to a maximum of six ground safety observers to ensure sufficient currency and
   proficiency for each. The normal ground safety observer tour of duty is one year. New
   ground safety observers may be trained during mid-season for PCS/deployment reasons if
   necessary, but the maximum number remains six. All ground safety observer names will be
 36                                               AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011


   recorded in the demo team grade book. WG/CC, OG/CC, OG/CD, SQ/CC, and SQ/DO may
   perform ground safety observer duties at any time, provided they are current and qualified in
   the MDS.
2.4. Support Personnel Selection. Support personnel are selected by the wing commander. As
new enlisted personnel are assigned to the demonstration teams, it is appropriate to request
assignment deferments. However, since AFPCâ€™s support/approval of the deferments is directly
linked to overseas assignment vulnerability, it is strongly recommended that prospective local
candidates be verified by the MAJCOM Airman Assignments Branch before they are firmly
hired. A cursory check with AFPC can prevent the WG/CC from hiring people for the team who
are extremely vulnerable for PCS.
2.5. Training. Training will be accomplished according to the guidelines of this instruction and
as supplemented.
2.5. (ACC)Training. Training for the USAFHFP is completed at the annual HFTC IAW
paragraph 2.7. The HFTC is designed to train ACC military pilots to perform their HF mission.
This training is also a requirement for certification of new AFHFF civilian pilots. ACC/A3TA
will coordinate military and civilian aircraft availability for the HFTC. A3TA will develop the
HFTC flying schedule to accomplish all training syllabus requirements for military
demonstration pilots, military HF pilots, and civilian warbird pilots.
   2.5.1. The Wing commander may alter the training sequence and individual sorties, as
   necessary, to ensure proficiency and progress. Additional training sorties (TS) may be added
   as required.
   2.5.2. Maneuvers and maneuver sequences will be performed as described in this AFI. New
   demonstration pilots will demonstrate proficiency in the high, low, and flat show profiles.
   2.5.3. New demonstration pilots will receive flight training from a currently qualified
   demonstration pilot. Each new demonstration pilot will receive extensive ground training
   from their predecessor or a currently qualified demonstration pilot.
   2.5.3. (ACC) Demonstration and military HF Pilots will review FAA Order 8900.1 during
   initial ground training. Teams must read carefully the sections on Participant and Aircraft
   Eligibility, Air Show Space Requirements, Minimum Safety Distances and Altitudes,
   Military Performances, and FAA AFS-800 Maneuvers Packages Approval Process, so they
   are familiar with the perspective of their local FSDO.
   2.5.4. New demonstration pilots will receive training in aircraft flight control limitations and
   performance characteristics affecting the demonstration profile. New demonstration pilots
   will receive training on common conditions leading to aborts for each maneuver. F-16
   demonstration pilots will receive training on the flight control system, FLCS limiters and
   their effect on level flight, and sustaining inverted level flight at <165 KCAS.
   2.5.5. New demonstration pilots and ground safety observers will receive academic and
   flight training for abort procedures. Demonstration pilots will conduct a minimum of one
   abort procedure during monthly recurrent practice demonstrations, and a minimum of three
   during upgrade sorties TS-5 through TS-11.
   2.5.6. New demonstration pilots who will fly off-station demonstrations will attend a
   minimum of two air shows with the current demonstration pilot. If possible, the new pilot
AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                             37


  will fly with the current demonstration pilot in each air show practice demonstration (N/A for
  A-10 & F-22).
  2.5.7. A-10 and F-22 will use a chase aircraft for TS-3 and TS-4; and may use a chase
  aircraft for missions TS-5 through TS-11, or the instructor may observe from the ground with
  wing commander approval. The minimum altitude for chase aircraft is 1,500 feet AGL.
  2.5.8. All training will be accomplished in VMC. Each practice, except TS-3 and TS-4, will
  be over a runway environment. All training flights below 2,000 feet AGL will be videotaped.
  2.5.9. The currently qualified demonstration pilot monitoring the training program will
  observe the first solo training flight from the ground, and may act as the safety observer.
  2.5.10. Demonstration team film crews will be thoroughly trained. Training should
  emphasize equipment operation, sound techniques to capture demonstration narration, and
  techniques to capture the ground environment in the field of view during low altitude
  maneuvers.
  2.5.11. Training performance will be documented in an official grade book and progress
  monitored by the wing commander. All training flights will be reviewed by the senior
  leadership IAW paragraph 1.4.5.8.
  2.5.12. Final wing commander review, pre/re-certification of the demonstration crew,
  ground safety observer, and certification of narrator(s) will be documented and forwarded by
  the wing commander IAW paragraph 1.4.5.3 or 1.4.5.4. First-year pilots who will fly
  demonstrations off-station must accomplish at least one practice flight off home station prior
  to MAJCOM/CC certification.
  2.5.13. Stage 1/Stage 2 Altitude Step-down Process:
     2.5.13.1. Definitions: Stage 1: All maneuvers will be flown no lower than a target
     altitude of 500 feet with a minimum altitude of 400 feet (the F-16 High Alpha Pass and
     the A-10 Gear Down Pass will use a minimum altitude of 450 feet). Stage 2: All
     maneuvers will be flown no lower than the target and minimum altitudes described in this
     AFI.
     2.5.13.2. Upgrading pilots who will fly demonstrations off-station are required to
     practice at a minimum of three separate off-station sites at Stage 1 (higher) altitudes prior
     to the first official public demonstration. The intent of this requirement is for all
     upgrading pilots to gain experience at a minimum of three separate sites in a training
     environment before stepping down to Stage 2 (lower) altitudes off-station in an actual
     airshow environment. This requirement only affects off-station practices. All home
     station practices will adhere to the normal altitude step-down procedures set forth in the
     training syllabus. At overseas locations where this requirement is impractical, all practice
     demonstrations may be conducted at home station. However, every attempt will be made
     to satisfy the off-site training requirement before reverting to home field practices only to
     satisfy syllabus requirements.
     2.5.13.3. These off-station practices require former demonstration pilot observation
     and/or supervisor observation (no less than OG/CD or WG/CC designee).
     2.5.13.4. All tapes/grade sheets for off-station practices require former demonstration
     pilot and/or OG/CC or WG/CC designee review.
38                                            AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011


     2.5.13.5. NAF/MAJCOM/CC certifications may be used for partial fulfillment of this
     requirement.
     2.5.13.6. After the three off-station events are accomplished and with OG/CC
     concurrence, the upgrading pilot will perform a practice demonstration over home station
     at Stage 2 altitudes with OG/CC or WG/CC designee observation. The OG/CC may then
     certify the upgrading pilot to perform at Stage 2 altitudes for the remainder of the
     demonstration tour. This certification must be documented in the upgrading pilotâ€™s grade
     book.
  2.5.14. Ground Safety Observer Training.
     2.5.14.1. During any capability demonstration the ground safety observer is responsible
     to advise the demonstration pilot by radio of any observed or developing unsafe
     condition. This requires intimate knowledge of required maneuver radio calls, maneuver
     parameters, and the timing of maneuvers so that safety observer radio calls provide
     timely correction to an observed or developing deviation from procedure or direction
     prescribed in this publication. Safety observers will complete a closed-book parameters
     test for those maneuvers requiring parameter radio calls, corrected to 100 percent by a
     current demo pilot, prior to performing duties solo. This training will be documented in
     the demo team grade book.
     2.5.14.2. To increase "air show situational awareness" and improve the mutual support
     with the demo pilot, ground safety observers will have a working knowledge of the
     following subjects: air show airspace; the aerobatic box; show lines; crowd lines;
     applicable FARs that require waiver; interaction with the air boss; and air show
     communication plans. These subjects will be reviewed by upgrading safety observers,
     and briefed by current demo pilots, using the Safety Observer academics provided by
     ACC/A3TA. This training will be documented in the demo team grade book prior to
     performing duties solo. For a copy of this course, please contact ACC/A3TA. In addition,
     it is recommended that at least one ground safety observer per base attend the Air Shows
     101 course at ICAS each year. Ground safety observers must also be familiar with all
     applicable procedures and parameters relevant to MDS in this publication.
     2.5.14.3. Upgrading safety observers must complete a two-sortie checkout. For the first
     sortie, the upgrading safety observer will observe a certified ground safety observer
     during an official or practice high show demonstration. For the second sortie, the
     upgrading ground safety observer will execute the duties of the safety observer at an
     official or practice high show demonstration while under the observation of a certified
     safety observer. This training will be documented in the demo team grade book.
  2.5.15. (Added-ACC) For the purpose of professional pilot development, ACC
  Demonstration Team members and military HF pilots are authorized flights offered by: ACC
  Single-Ship demonstration pilots, AFHFF pilots, National Demonstration Teams
  (USAFADS, Blue Angels, Snow Birds, Red Arrows, etc), and recognized International
  Council of Airshows (ICAS) Aerobatic Competency Evaluators (ACE) and Inspectors.
  These flights will not impact team deployments, performances, or redeployments.

                                           Chapter 3

                          A-10 DEMONSTRATION MANEUVERS

Section 3Aâ€”General Guidelines

3.1. General. Maneuvers described in this chapter will be used for training and for A-10 aerial
demonstrations. The demonstration sequence is designed so each maneuver is normally
performed in the same direction with respect to the crowd line. As a result, the show is always
oriented the same way from the spectators' point of view. The only exception to this is when
wind direction and velocity make it advantageous to change the direction of the gear down pass.
In this case, the remaining maneuvers may be flown in the opposite direction, or repositions may
be used to fly the remaining maneuvers in the appropriate direction. Abnormal Procedures are
written for each maneuver. If the entry conditions are not met for any maneuver, a wings-level
pass will be flown and the pilot will transition to the next maneuver. Demonstration pilots will
transmit parameters prior to initiating the descending portion of vertical pull-throughs and
Vertical Reposition maneuvers. These calls will be made when the pilot reaches apex of the
maneuver. Ground safety observer will monitor demonstration pilot altitude and airspeed radio
calls and direct an abort when parameter limits are exceeded. Following all maneuvers and
before clearing the show line to reposition for the next maneuver, the pilot will ensure any
descent has been stopped and the aircraft is in a climbing or level attitude with the flight path
marker at or above the horizon.
3.1.1. (ACC) (Added) Pyro. Only qualified personnel will be permitted to utilize
pyrotechnics (pyro) in association with the ACC A-10 demonstration teams. Each calendar year
the ICAS Pyro Safety Subcommittee identifies personnel as approved Shooters in Charge (SICs).
Selection will be based on experience, judgment, and safety record. Only those SICs approved
by the ICAS Pyro Safety Subcommittee will be allowed to work with ACC demonstration teams.
ACC/A3TA will provide the ACC demonstration teams with a current list of ICAS approved
SICs when available.

       3.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) The following maximum Net Explosive Weights (NEW) will be
       used (all NEWs in this regulation are TNT equivalent):
           3.1.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) For strafe passes, a series of up to 40 charges will be fired,
           with a maximum of one pound NEW each. The â€•ending shotâ€– for each strafe pass
           will be a maximum two-pound NEW charge.
           3.1.1.1.2. (Added-ACC) For the bomb pass, a maximum NEW of 5 pounds will be
           used.
           3.1.1.1.3. (Added-ACC) A â€•Wall of Fireâ€– pass may be substituted for the bomb
           pass. The maximum NEW is dependent on the length of the wall. The maximum
           wall length is 2000 linear feet, and the maximum NEW is 20 pounds (spread out
           evenly). No more than 1 pound NEW will be used for each 100 linear feet of wall.
       3.1.1.2. (Added) The following items will be briefed by the ACC demonstration pilot
       and the SIC, in person, prior to each performance:
AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                             45



 Exact dimensions of the pyrotechnics area and the magnitude of explosives being used.
 Aircraft/pyro deconfliction plan.
 Demonstration profile and sequence of pyro (strafe, bomb, etc).
 Forecast wind and effects on pyro.
 Communications plan.
 Knock-it-off (KIO) procedures.
 Fire hazards and fire department response plan.
 FOD potential and effects.


3.2. Aircraft Configuration and Fuel Requirements. Aircraft configuration for all
demonstrations will be clean. Each demonstration uses approximately 1,000 pounds of fuel.
Optimum performance is obtained when fuel load is 3,500 pounds; however, the demonstration
can be safely accomplished with a higher fuel load as long as the wing tanks are empty. The
minimum fuel to start the show is 2,500 pounds.
3.3. Airspeed and G Limits. The A-10 demonstration is flown at max power except when
slowing to configure for the gear down pass or slowing to configure for the minimum run
landing. The maximum Target G for this demonstration profile is 6.0 Gs. This does not preclude
a momentary increase in G for safety considerations.
3.4. Show Line Restrictions. The majority of the A-10 demonstration will be flown on the
1,500-foot show line in reference to the distance from the crowd. Non-aerobatic maneuvers (less
than 90 degrees of bank) may be flown on the 500-foot show line unless specified in the
maneuver description.
3.5. Airspace and Runway Requirements. Required airspace for the A-10 is 7,000 feet AGL
vertically and normally a five-mile radius from show center horizontally. The minimum
dimensions of the aerobatic box are 3,000 feet wide, 4,000 feet long, and 7,000 feet AGL (high
show). If the FAA has waived a show line to closer than 1,500 feet, the aerobatic box may be
less than 3,000 feet wide, provided there is at least 1,500 feet from the show line to the outer
edges of the box. Minimum runway length is 5,000 feet x 75 feet. The runway, taxiway, and
parking area must be stressed for a 35,000-pound aircraft with single wheel type landing gear.
3.6. Weather Requirements. Weather PARAMETER LIMITS for the high show profile are a
ceiling of at least 4,000 feet, 3 miles ground and 5 miles in-flight visibility with a discernible
horizon. The low show profile ceiling is at least 2,500 feet. The flat show profile ceiling is at
least 1,500 feet. Maneuvers will be planned to maintain VMC throughout the show sequence.

   3.8.1. Maneuver Description. The Repositioning Turn uses both horizontal and vertical
   turning room to change direction at each end of the show line. The vertical plane is used to
   maintain necessary proximity to the demonstration area. Each turn may differ slightly in
   order to meet entry TARGET PARAMETERS for the next maneuver and attain the proper
   show line alignment. To begin the maneuver, turn 15 to 45 degrees away from the crowd
   (depending on environmental conditions), rollout, and pull to 45 degrees nose high, and then
   unload. At 1,000 feet minimum, execute a 270-degree aileron roll opposite the show line.
   Visually acquire the show line and make a descending turn to meet the entry TARGET
   PARAMETERS for the next maneuver. Repositioning turns may not include added aileron
   rolls or other accenting maneuvers.
   3.8.2. Abnormal Procedure: If at any time the minimum altitude, airspeed, or climb
   angles, cannot be achieved or maintained, roll the aircraft to the nearest horizon and recover
   to wings level flight.

   (120 knots minimum). At 3,500 feet AGL (or 1,000 feet AGL minimum for the Low Show),
   initiate a 45-degree dive (55 degrees maximum) back to the appropriate show line for the
   next maneuver. Exit from the High Speed Reposition Maneuver by pulling at 1,200 feet
   using 5.0 to 6.0 Gs to level off at the appropriate entry altitude for the next maneuver.
   3.9.2. Abnormal Procedure: If at anytime the minimum altitude, airspeed, or climb angles
   cannot be achieved or maintained, roll the aircraft to the nearest horizon and recover to
   wings-level flight.
3.10. Flat Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn is a
combination horizontal and shallow vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the
show line. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn uses less altitude than a normal Repositioning
Maneuver. It requires a larger cut and tends to be looser and flatter than a normal Repositioning
Maneuver. The target G for this maneuver is 3 to 5 Gs. Each turn may differ slightly so that
airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the Flat Wifferdill. The
entry "cut" turn for the Flat Wifferdill is made to ensure no show line or crowd line penetration.

   3.11.1. Maneuver Description. Accomplish a normal takeoff with 7-degree flaps. The
   rotation airspeed is 110 knots and should be accomplished using a smooth, continuous pull to
   obtain the normal takeoff attitude. Raise the gear with a positive rate of climb and retract the
   flaps once the gear is up and the gear horn is out. After gear and flap retraction, level off at
   30 feet and accelerate to a minimum of 175 knots. At show center or the end of the runway,
   with a minimum of 175 knots, pull up 30 to 45 degrees nose high using 3.0 to 4.0 Gs or the
   steady stall warning tone. Turn 15 to 45 degrees away from the crowd and continue climb
   out.
   3.11.2. Abnormal Procedure: Use caution when taking off from short runways, runways at
   high density altitudes, or wet runways. TOLD data is critical and must be computed very
   carefully at each show site. Do not fly if refusal speed is less than continuation speed. During
   the climb out, if the aircraft stalls or the airspeed falls below 110 knots (whichever occurs
   first) unload and accelerate to break the stall and/or increase airspeed to a minimum of 110
   knots. Climbout can then be continued.

   3.12.1. Maneuver Description. The Flat Pass is a maneuver used alone or in combination
   with a Wifferdill/Reposition for the purposes of displaying the aircraft or orienting the
   subsequent demonstration maneuver in the approved direction relative to the crowd line. It
   may be flown in either direction at any time during the demonstration sequence if required. It
   should be flown wings level down the 500-foot show line at 300 feet AGL.
   3.12.2. Abnormal Procedure: If any problems are encountered, the demo pilot should
   begin an immediate climbing turn away from the crowd.

   3.13.1. Maneuver Description. (High Show only) After reaching the minimum entry
   parameters, perform an unloaded roll to inverted and perform an aggressive 135-degree pull
   through vertical, to no greater than 45 degrees nose low in the opposite direction. Once
   recovery above the minimum altitude for the follow-on maneuver is assured, vary the G
   loading and dive angle as necessary to meet the entry parameters for the next maneuver. As a
   technique, passing approximately 1,200â€™ AGL begin a 5-6 G pull to level off at 500â€™ AGL.
   3.13.2. Abnormal Procedure: If the entry parameters are not met, the pilot will transition
   to a slice back as appropriate. Do not attempt to pull down from the inverted apex below
   4,500â€™ AGL or with more than 250 KIAS. If at any time, before reaching the 45 degrees nose
   low position, the aircraft exceeds 375 knots, reduce the throttles and open the speed.

   3.14.1. Maneuver Description. Position the aircraft on the 1,500â€™ show line at 500â€™ AGL
   and 325 knots using a reposition maneuver. Approximately 2,000â€™ prior to show center,
   initiate an 8-10 degree nose-high climb and begin an 8-second coordinated roll to the left.
   Top rudder should be applied approaching 90 degrees, and then slowly fed out as forward
   stick pressure is applied to reach -1 G inverted flight at the 180-degree point. Left rudder is
   slowly fed in through the 270-degree point and slowly fed out to reach upright 1 G flight
   at500â€™ AGL. Dive angle during the exit should not exceed 8 degrees.
   3.14.2. Abnormal Procedure: Abort the maneuver if at any time the nose falls more than 8
   degrees below the horizon or the nose drops below the horizon prior to the inverted point.
   Aborting the maneuver is accomplished by rolling towards the nearest horizon to wings level
   and climbing to ensure recovery at or above minimum altitude is achieved. Excessive nose
   drop is most likely to occur during the second half of the roll due to insufficient negative
   stick pressure, and a decrease in airspeed resulting in less control surface effectiveness.

   Aborting the maneuver is accomplished by rolling towards the nearest horizon to wings level
   and climbing to ensure recovery at or above minimum altitude is achieved. Excessive nose

   3.16.1. Maneuver Description. With wings level and 500 feet AGL begin a smooth 6.0 G
   pull not to exceed the steady stall warning tone. Minimum apex altitude is 3,000 feet AGL
   with a minimum of 120 knots. Continue the pull until the aircraft is 45 degrees nose low
   inverted (55 degrees maximum). Due to winds, it may be necessary to use more or less than
   45 degrees nose low in order to maintain show center orientation. The typical range is
   between 30 to 55 degrees nose low. Do not exceed 55 degrees nose low. At 2,500 feet AGL,
   roll upright while maintaining 45 degrees nose low. At 1,200 feet AGL, begin a 6.0 G pull to
   level flight at 500 feet AGL. Normal apex altitude is 3,500 to 5,000 feet AGL depending
   upon environmental conditions. The second half is completed in the opposite direction. Upon
   completion of the maneuver, begin a 30-60 degree climb to set-up for the Split-S.
   3.16.2. Abnormal Procedure: If at anytime during the maneuver it appears you will not
   attain the prescribed altitude or airspeed over the top, abort the maneuver by performing an
   unloaded roll to a wings-level position. Furthermore, if more than 45 degrees nose low
   inverted is required due to winds, add 100 feet for every degree steep to roll out and pull out
   altitudes. If more than 55 degrees nose low, roll out immediately, and recover to level flight
   using a max performance pull (steady to chopped tone).

   complete, pull the aircraft gently over onto its back and roll upright at no less than 110 knots.
   Drive straight ahead and attain target entry parameters for the next maneuver.
   3.17.2. Abnormal Procedure: Vary the angle of climb for wind, weather, and aerobatic-
   box considerations. If at any time during the maneuver it appears the maneuver will not attain

   and 325 knots. At approximately 1,500 feet past show center, turn away from the crowd
   using approximately 85 degrees of bank. Begin the turn with a smooth G onset rate to
   maintain 6.0 Gs or the steady stall warning horn whichever occurs first. G-loading and
   airspeed bleed-off rate will vary with density altitude. Maintain a minimum of 240 knots. The
   first 180 degrees of turn should be accomplished with a 1 Â¾-degree nose-up attitude and the
   last 180 should be accomplished with a 1 Â¾-degree nose-down attitude to make the turn
   appear level to the crowd. Vary the bank angle and pitch to arrive at level flight at the
   completion of 360 degrees of turn and to ensure the maneuver is finished above the entry
   altitude. Surface winds must be taken into consideration in order to center this maneuver and
   to avoid overshooting the show line. Continue the turn past 360 degrees as required (usually
   30 to 45 additional degrees of turn depending on winds) in order to transition to the
   reposition maneuver used to set-up for the Gear Down pass.
   3.19.2. Abnormal Procedure. If the minimum entry parameters are not met, the pilot will
   transition to a wings-level flat pass. If during any portion of the maneuver it becomes
   apparent the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL or airspeed decay below 240 knots,
   abort the maneuver by rolling wings level and climbing to 500 feet AGL. If necessary, adjust
   G as required (no lower than 240 knots) to avoid overshooting the show line.

   3.20.1. Maneuver Description. After completion of the Level 360, initiate a turn toward
   the 500-foot show line and begin slowing the aircraft below 200 knots with full speed brakes.
   Upon reaching the base position for the 500-foot show line and below 200 knots, configure
   the aircraft with gear, full flaps, and 40% speed brakes and begin a descent down to 300 feet
   AGL. Continue slowing the aircraft to 120 knots (110 knots minimum) while flying down the
   500-foot show line. When passing the last of the crowd, select max power, close the speed
   brakes, and bring the flaps to seven degrees while smoothly raising the nose to a 25 to 35-
   degree climb. While climbing, turn away from the crowd as required using 30 degrees of
   bank (45 degrees maximum). During this climbing turn, raise the gear.
   3.20.2. Abnormal Procedure. If the minimum altitude or airspeed cannot be maintained, or
   the aircraft stalls, abort the maneuver by selecting max power, closing the speed brakes, and
   setting the flaps to MVR. If still sinking, consider engaging the fuel flows to override.

   3.21.1. Maneuver Description. After performing a reposition maneuver, align the aircraft
   to approach the preplanned strafe target/point from an appropriate angle. This angle will
   normally range from 10 â€“ 30 degrees off the show line depending on the location of the
   crowd line and winds. Do not allow a vector towards the crowd! The aircraft vector, if
   extended to infinity, must not penetrate the crowd line. The dive angle will normally be 10 â€“
   30 (5 â€“ 15 Flat) degrees nose low depending on winds. The optimum dive angle is 25 10
   Flat) degrees. Do not exceed 30 (15 Flat) degrees. Recovery should be initiated at 650 feet
   AGL using a max performance pull in order to bottom out at or above 200 feet AGL. Be very
   careful not to over-G the aircraft during this pull. In order to make this corner, a minimum of
   250 knots must be obtained. After recovering to level flight, accomplish a reposition
   maneuver to set-up for the next strafe pass. Use the 500-foot show line at show center as a
   reference point for setting up each strafe pass. Do not cross the 500-foot show line.
   Depending on winds, this may require aiming 100 â€“ 300 feet outside the 500-foot line away
   from the crowd. Following the last strafe pass, transition to the Jink-Out maneuver.
   3.21.2. Abnormal Procedure. If at any time the dive angle exceeds 30 (15 Flat) degrees,
   either abort the pass and fly through straight and level or shift the aim point longer and
   parallel to the show line until the dive angle is 30 (15 Flat) degrees or less. Check airspeed at
   1,000 feet AGL. If it is not at least 230 knots, abort the pass and fly through straight and
   level.

   3.22.1. Maneuver Description. Upon completion of the last strafe pass and level at the
   200-foot target altitude, an 80 to 90-degree bank 5.0 to 6.0 G turn is initiated away from the
   crowd to complete a 100 to 135-degree turn to be at or beyond the 1,500-foot show line. At
   the completion of this 100 to 135-degree turn, pull 3.0 to 5.0 Gs up to 40 degrees (55 degrees
   maximum). Once pitch degree is achieved, maintain climb to 2,000 feet AGL, then roll
   inverted and pull to 30 degrees nose low (40 degrees maximum). Hold till 1,200 feet AGL,
   then roll to the nearest horizon and level off at 500 feet AGL. The goal of this maneuver is to
   show the Jink-Out in front of show center and be at the 1,500-foot line. In order for this to
   occur, the 100 to 135 degrees of turn is accomplished at a target of 4.0 Gs.
   3.22.2. Abnormal Procedure. If at any time during the maneuver any altitude or
   climb/dive angle will not be maintained, abort by rolling wings level and climbing away
   from the crowd line.

   3.23.1. Maneuver Description. Enter the Four-Point roll at 500 feet AGL and 325 knots.
   2,000 feet prior to show center, pull the nose 3 to 5 degrees nose high, establish a climb, and
   unload. A cadence four-point roll to the left is then performed by pausing momentarily at the
   90-degree, 180-degree, 270-degree, and 360-degree points. The pace of the cadence should
   ensure the aircraft is at the 180-degree point over show center. In order to facilitate sharp
   transitions between each 90 degrees of roll, momentarily fan the speed brakes and unload the
   aircraft to 0 Gs at the initiation of each roll. Be sure to close the speed brakes upon
   completion of the roll to avoid any unnecessary loss of airspeed. The 90-degree and 270-
   degree points require top rudder to maintain level flight and zero G to maintain the show line.
   The 180-degree point requires 1 negative G in order to maintain level flight. This is
   accomplished using the horizon, not the G meter.
   3.23.2. Abnormal Procedure. If at anytime during the Four-Point Roll, the nose falls more
   than five degrees below the horizon, abort by rolling towards the nearest horizon and a
   wings-level position, then continue down the show line. This would most likely occur during
   the 3rd point (270 degrees) due to a decrease in airspeed, which results in less rudder
   effectiveness.
3.24. Dedication Pass. The intent of this maneuver is to pay tribute to our war fighters. It is to
be flown before the Tactical Pitch-Up to Land during the High, Low, and Flat Show profiles.

   3.24.1. Maneuver Description. The maneuver is flown on the 500-foot line and is non-
   aerobatic. After performing the Four-Point Roll or Strafe Passes, execute a reposition
   maneuver on the crowd side to arrive behind and offset the crowd. The approach will be
   flown from behind the line, approximately 2 miles from show center, with an approximate 30
   degree dive angle and a 45 degree cut (max bank angle 90 degrees) to the show line,
   remaining 500 feet from the crowd at all times. Upon reaching a point 500 feet from the
   corner of the crowd and 300 feet AGL, roll the aircraft into a level arcing pass using a max
   bank of 90 degrees. Use top rudder if necessary to maintain altitude. Optimum profile of the

   aircraft is achieved at approximately 80 degrees of bank. Use caution not to over bank the
   aircraft and allow the aircraft to lose altitude while banking. In order to maintain 500 feet
   from the crowd at each corner, the flight path at show center will have to extend beyond 500
   feet. Continue the arc beyond the opposite crowd corner, roll out of bank, and continue a
   maximum 45 degree climb to set up for the Tactical Pitch-Up to Landing.
   3.24.2. Abnormal Procedures. Abort the maneuver if at any time the aircraft comes closer
   than 500â€™ to the crowd line or its lateral limits, an excessive dive angle or sink rate develops,
   entry parameters are not met, or the aircraft descends below 200 feet AGL. Abort the
   maneuver by rolling the aircraft wings level and flying away from the crowd.

   3.25.1. Maneuver Description. Reposition the aircraft to level off at 300 feet AGL, on the
   500-foot show line at 325 knots (200 knots minimum). Roll into 80 to 90 degrees of bank to
   turn 90 degrees away from the crowd line. Once pointed away from the crowd, pull 5.0 to 6.0
   Gs to 40 degrees nose high to achieve 1,000 feet AGL minimum. At 1,000 feet AGL
   minimum execute a non-acrobatic 270-degree roll and pull toward the perch point of the
   landing runway. Begin slowing the aircraft and configure for landing with gear, full flaps,
   and 40% speed brakes. Fly a normal base to final (no slower than 135 knots final turn). On
   final, continue slowing to 120 knots (110 minimum) to touchdown. After touchdown,
   perform a minimum run landing by lowering the nose, opening the speed brakes full, and
   initiating full anti-skid braking bringing the aircraft to a complete stop. Plan to do the
   minimum run landing to stop at show center. This is accomplished by planning your
   touchdown point 2,000 feet prior to show center. Do not land 2,000 feet prior to show center
   if, at the point of touchdown, there is less than 5,000 feet of useable runway remaining. In
   this case, plan your touchdown normally in the first 500 feet of runway. Option: If a Heritage
   Flight is to be performed immediately following completion of the demonstration, this
   maneuver may be deleted and a Flat Pass may be substituted. If not deleted, conduct a wings-
   level low approach or wings-level pass and proceed to rejoin with Heritage Flight aircraft
   using pre-briefed procedures.
   3.25.2. Abnormal Procedures. If airspeeds, altitudes, or stall warning indications are
   experienced with the stick shaker, a Go-Around must be executed to recover the aircraft.
   Once the Go-Around is completed, the pilot will then turn out to downwind (away from the
   crowd) and set up for a normal straight-in to full stop.
3.26. Staged Show Sites. When demonstration aircraft takeoff from other than the air show
site, fuel planning must include the fuel required flying to and from the show site, and any
holding time required. The pilot may enter the show from behind the crowd at a minimum of
1000 ft AGL as depicted in Figure 3.18, or via a Flat Pass maneuver down the show line, and
AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                               73


complete the show as described in this chapter. Upon completion of the Dedication Pass and
clearing the crowd, turn out behind the crowd and return to the staging airport. Pilots should plan
to fly a full demonstration, but may cut the profile short as required to maintain suitable enroute
return fuel.

Figure 3.18. A-10 Staged Show Sites.




3.27. (Added-ACC) Maneuver Description â€“ Pyro. Prior to the start of the demonstration,
the demonstration pilot or safety observer will get a radio check from the SIC. Radio contact
will only be initiated by the demonstration pilot or safety observer, and in no instance will the
SIC talk to the pilot unless safety of flight becomes an issue. Immediately prior to the first LAS
pass, the demonstration pilot or safety observer will make a â€•next pass hotâ€– call. This will alert
the SIC to the first strafe run and give the SIC permission to discharge the pyrotechnics as
briefed. The demonstration pilot will call all shots; however, the demonstration pilot may
delegate this to the safety observer. The pilotâ€™s primary responsibility is to fly the demonstration
without distraction, and radio calls between the safety observer and the SIC will be kept to the
absolute minimum necessary.
   3.27.1. (Added-ACC) An increased NEW does not affect the fragmentation pattern.
   However, deconfliction with the aircraft will be based on altitude, timing and lateral offsets.
   For strafe passes, the aircraft will turn away from the target area prior to flying over the pyro
   (similar to real-world strafe). For the bomb or â€•Wall of Fireâ€– pass, the SIC will not fire the
   pyro until the aircraft is past the pyro area and begins the pull off-target. For all passes, the
   aircraft will fly a ground track that is offset at least 150 feet from the pyro effect and go no
   lower than 300 feet AGL. IAW AFMAN 91-201, explosives safety standards dictate a

  from the crowd line. The ACC pilot may continue the demonstration on the 500-foot show
  line. For all non-Air Force Base show sites, pyro will be set up a minimum of 650 feet from
  the crowd line, allowing the aircraft to fly on the 500-foot show line.

  safety becomes an issue, anyone on the radio may make a KIO call. Following a KIO call,
  the pilot will discontinue the routine and the pilot, safety observer, and SIC will acknowledge
  the call. If there is ever a question of timing, safety, or sequence, the SIC will not shoot the
  pyro.

                          F-15 DEMONSTRATION MANEUVERS

Section 4Aâ€”General Information

4.1. General. Maneuvers described in this chapter will be used for training and for F-15 aerial
demonstrations. The demonstration sequence is designed so each maneuver is normally flown in
the same direction with respect to the crowd line with the following exceptions: Flat Pass, Knife
Edge, Photo Pass, and the aileron roll preceding the tactical pitch to landing. As a result, the
show is always oriented the same way from the spectators' point of view. Abnormal procedures
are written for each maneuver. If the entry conditions are not met for any maneuver, a wings-
level pass will be flown and the pilot will transition to the next maneuver. Demonstration pilots
will transmit parameters prior to initiating the descending portion of vertical pull-throughs for
the Split-S and Vertical Reposition Maneuvers. These calls will be made when the pilot reaches
apex of the maneuver. Ground safety observer will monitor demonstration pilot altitude and
airspeed radio calls and direct an abort when parameter limits are exceeded. Following all
maneuvers and before clearing the show line to reposition for the next maneuver, the pilot will
ensure any descent has been stopped and the aircraft is in a climbing or level attitude with the
flight path marker at or above the horizon.
4.2. Aircraft Configuration and Fuel Requirements. Aircraft configuration for all
demonstrations may be clean, clean with wing pylons, or clean with wing pylons and 1 or 2
smokewinders on stations 2A and/or 8B. Fuel considerations include: divert requirements, cable
availability, temperature, and density altitude. Normal minimum fuel for takeoff is:
   4.2.1. Staged Show: 13,500 pounds
   4.2.2. High Show: 11,000 pounds
   4.2.3. Low Show: 9,000 pounds
4.2. (ACC) Aircraft Configuration and Fuel Requirements. Aircraft configuration for all
capabilities demonstrations will be clean.
4.3. Airspeed and G Limits. Demonstration pilots will not exceed 0.94 Mach. The maximum
target G for this demonstration is 7.5 Gs. This does not preclude a momentary increase in G for
safety considerations.
4.4. Show line Restrictions. The majority of the F-15 demonstration will be flown on the
1,500-foot show line in reference to the distance from the crowd. Non-aerobatic maneuvers (less
than 90 degrees of bank) may be flown on the 500-foot show line unless specified in the
maneuver description.
4.5. Airspace and Runway Requirements. Required airspace for the F-15 is 15,000 feet AGL
and normally a five-mile radius from show center horizontally. The minimum dimensions of the
aerobatic box are 3,000 feet wide, 6,000 feet long, and 15,000 feet AGL (high show). If the FAA
has waived a show line to closer than 1,500 feet, the aerobatic box may be less than 3,000 feet
wide, provided there is at least 1,500 feet from the show line to the outer edges of the box.
Minimum runway length is 7,000 feet x 75 feet. The runway, taxiway, and parking area must be
stressed for a 45,000-pound aircraft with single wheel type landing gear.

4.6. Weather Requirements. Weather PARAMETER LIMITS for the high profile are a ceiling
of at least 7,000 feet, three miles ground and five miles in-flight visibility with a discernible
horizon. The low show profile ceiling is at least 2,500 feet. The flat show profile ceiling is at
least 1,500 feet. Maneuvers will be planned to maintain VMC throughout the show sequence.
4.7. High Density Altitude Demonstrations. For high density altitude shows, adjust
PARAMETER LIMITS in accordance with the following:
   4.7.1. Add 500 feet to APEX altitudes for each 2,000 feet of altitude above 3,000 feet MSL
   and 10 knots to airspeeds. For example, if the show site altitude is 5,000 feet MSL, add 500
   feet to the baseline target and 10 knots to the airspeed. If the show site altitude is 7,000 feet
   MSL, add 1,000 feet to the baseline target and 20 knots to the airspeed.

time during the demonstration sequence as required. Repositioning turns may not include added
aileron rolls or other accenting maneuvers.

   4.9.1. Flat Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn is a
   combination horizontal and shallow vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the
   show line when performing the low profile. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn uses less
   altitude than a normal Wifferdill. It requires a larger cut and tends to be looser and flatter
   than a normal Wifferdill. 270-degree turn reversal may be made while the aircraft is
   climbing. The target G for this maneuver is 6.5 to 7.0 Gs. Each turn may differ slightly so
   that airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the flat Wifferdill.
   The entry "cut" turn for the flat Wifferdill is made to ensure no show line or crowd line
   penetration.

Figure 4.2. F-15 Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver.




   4.9.2. Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. The Wifferdill turn is a combination horizontal
   and vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the show line. The vertical plane is
   used to maintain necessary proximity to the demonstration area. Each turn may differ slightly
   so that airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the Wifferdill.
   As the aircraft departs the show line, maneuver in the horizontal and vertical plane to
   reposition for the next maneuver. The target G for this maneuver is 6.5 to 7.0 Gs. A 270-
   degree turn reversal is made while still climbing. During the last half of the Wifferdill, while
   descending, the turn is adjusted to establish the proper show line entry. The entry "cut" turn
   for the Wifferdill is made to ensure no show line or crowd line penetration.

   4.9.3. Vertical Reposition Maneuver. The Vertical Reposition Maneuver may be flown to
   change direction at each end of the show line. Upon passing show center or at the completion
   of the previous maneuver with a minimum of 275 knots, begin a straight-ahead climb using
   6.5 to 7.0 Gs to put the aircraft in a 40 to 55-degree nose high attitude. At a minimum of
   3,800 feet AGL, perform an unloaded 180-degree roll to achieve an inverted climbing
   attitude. Initiate a smooth pull to the horizon to achieve a wings-level inverted position at or
   above 4,500 feet AGL. Continue the pull in maximum power though the vertical, using 3.0-
   5.0 Gs to 135 degrees of turn (45 degrees nose low). As the nose drops below the horizon and
   the airfield environment is reacquired, correct as necessary to complete the Vertical
   Reposition Maneuver down the show line. On a standard day, at 90 degrees nose low,
   airspeed should be between 220 to 400 knots and altitude greater than 3,500 feet AGL. At
   135 degrees, backpressure is relaxed and the aircraft smoothly flown to be in level flight at
   500 feet AGL for the next maneuver. Aircraft power should be modulated through the
   vertical to achieve the desired airspeed upon rollout for the next maneuver.
        4.9.3.1. Abnormal Procedures. If not within the target airspeed window, adjust pitch
        attitude during climb to achieve desired airspeed. If below minimum apex altitude,
        maintain an inverted climb until reaching minimum apex altitude. If you will be below
        3,500 feet AGL and over 400 knots prior to achieving 90 degrees nose low, execute
        emergency dive recovery procedures. If at anytime during the maneuver it appears that
        the aircraft will not attain the prescribed altitude/airspeed parameter limits, the maneuver
        will be aborted. Reposition the aircraft for follow-on maneuvering.

   4.10.1. Maneuver Description. The takeoff is performed without flaps and in afterburner.
   At 180 knots, execute a smooth, aft-pull of the stick to achieve takeoff rotation. After a
   positive rate of climb is established, retract the gear and set a pitch attitude of 40 to 70
   degrees nose high. Adjust pitch angle to maintain climb airspeed of 220 knots. If airspeed
   decreases below 200 knots, decrease pitch attitude to achieve climb airspeed.
   4.10.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the show profile takeoff is interrupted by an aircraft
   malfunction, make a normal takeoff or if conditions warrant, abort the takeoff. If the takeoff
   is continued in a thrust-limited situation or if takeoff distance is critical, consider lowering
   the flaps. If the takeoff is aborted, consider lowering the flaps. Max abort speed and SETOS
   calculations are based on a flap-down configuration.

   4.11.1. Maneuver Description. After takeoff and at a minimum of 3,800 feet AGL with an
   attitude of 40-70 degrees nose high, perform an unloaded 180-degree aileron roll to achieve
   an inverted climbing attitude. Initiate a smooth pull to the horizon to achieve a wings-level
   inverted position at 5,000 feet AGL. Continue the pull in maximum power through the
   vertical, using 2.0-4.0 Gs, to 135 degrees of turn (45 degrees nose low). As the nose drops
   below the horizon and the airfield environment is reacquired, correct as necessary to
   complete the Split-S down the show line. On a standard day, at 90 degrees nose low, airspeed
   should be between 200 to 300 knots and altitude greater than 3,500 feet AGL. At 135
   degrees, relax backpressure and smoothly transition to be in level flight at 500 feet AGL for
   the Flat Pass.
   4.11.2. Abnormal Procedures. If not within the target airspeed window, adjust pitch
   attitude during climb to achieve desired airspeed. If below minimum apex altitude, maintain
   an inverted climb until reaching minimum apex altitude. If you will be below 3,500 feet AGL
   and over 400 knots prior to achieving 90 degrees nose low, execute emergency dive recovery
   procedures. If at anytime during the maneuver it appears that the aircraft will not attain the
   prescribed altitude/ airspeed parameter limits, the maneuver will be aborted. Reposition the
   aircraft for follow-on maneuvering.

   4.13.1. Maneuver Description. At 3,000 feet prior to show center, smoothly pull the nose
   to five degrees up, establish a climb, and relax stick pressure. A cadenced four-point roll to
   the left is then performed by pausing momentarily at the 90-degree, 180-degree, 270-degree,
   and 360-degree points. Move the stick briskly, causing a left roll and an immediate stop at
   each point when pressure is released. The pace of the cadence should ensure the aircraft is at
   the 180-degree point over show center. At the completion of the pass and at the 360-degree
   point, a repositioning maneuver is performed to orient for a right to left initiation of the High
   G Turn.
   4.13.2. Abnormal Procedures. If starting parameter limits are not achieved, abort
   maneuver and transition to a flat pass. During the maneuver, if the nose is below the horizon
   at the 180-degree inverted point, abort the maneuver by rolling to wings level.

   4.14.1. Maneuver Description. At approximately 3,000 feet prior to show center, select
   full AB and accelerate to approximately 420 knots. At show center, turn away from the
   crowd using approximately 85 degrees of bank. Begin the turn with a smooth G onset rate to
   maintain airspeed at approximately 400 knots and 7.5 Gs. G-loading and airspeed bleed-off
   rate will vary with density altitude. The first 180 degrees of turn should be accomplished
   with a 1 Â¾ degree nose-up attitude and the last 180 degrees of turn should be accomplished
   with a 1 Â¾ degree nose-down attitude to make the turn appear level to the crowd. Vary the
   bank angle and pitch to arrive at level flight at the completion of 360 degrees of turn and to
   ensure the maneuver is finished above the entry altitude. Surface winds must be taken into
   consideration in order to center this maneuver on show center and to avoid overshooting the
   show line. As you approach show center, smoothly but briskly roll out. Perform a
   repositioning maneuver to set up for the Triple Roll.
   4.14.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the minimum entry parameters are not met, the pilot will
   transition to a wings-level flat pass. If during any portion of the maneuver it becomes
   apparent the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL or airspeed decay below 300 knots,
   abort the maneuver by rolling wings level and climbing to 500 feet AGL. If necessary, adjust
   power and G as required (no lower than 300 knots) to avoid overshooting the show line.

   4.15.1. Maneuver Description. At 3,000 feet prior to show center with 425 knots and a
   minimum of 500 feet AGL, raise the nose eight degrees, establish a climb, and relax stick
   pressure. Apply full left stick pressure to perform a maximum of three consecutive unloaded
   aileron rolls. As the second roll is completed, it is important to ensure the aircraft has gained
   altitude and the nose is still above the horizon. At the completion of the third roll, roll out and
   reposition for the Wing Walk.
   4.15.2. Abnormal Procedures. If starting parameters are not achieved, abort maneuver and
   transition to a flat pass. If the nose drops below level inverted on the second roll or roll

   4.16.1. Maneuver Description. Configure the aircraft (gear down and flaps up) and roll out
   no lower than 500 feet AGL with 190 knots. At 2,000 feet prior to show center, raise the nose
   five to ten degrees, advance the power slightly, and blend full aileron away from the crowd
   and opposite rudder to achieve 85 to 90 degrees of bank. Level flight and track is maintained
   with top rudder. Pause momentarily and reverse the roll, pause then reverse again to achieve
   three separate steep bank positions. When performing at field elevations of 3,000 feet or
   greater, only two wing rocks should be accomplished.
   4.16.2. Abnormal Procedure. If entry parameter limits are not met, abort the maneuver and
   perform a wings-level gear-down pass. 90 degrees of bank with the gear down is the
   maximum allowed in the Dash-1. NOTE: The Wing walk is a transition point to the
   medium/low profile if required by changing weather conditions.

   4.17.1. Maneuver Description. When wings level following the Wing Walk, select full
   afterburner, and raise the landing gear. Attain sufficient airspeed (300 knots) and begin a
   brisk but smooth wings-level pull to approximately 25-unit AOA. Normal apex altitude is
   above 3,500 feet AGL. At apex altitude, reduce to idle power. Airspeed should be 150- 250
   knots. The pull is held until the nose passes through 125-140 degrees of pitch where the
   backpressure is eased to maintain a constant nose track of 25-45 degrees nose low inverted.
   The 25 to 45-degree nose low inverted attitude is held until approximately 2,500 feet AGL.
   At 2,500 AGL, perform an unloaded roll to wings level upright and advance throttles to MIL.
   Roll the aircraft as necessary to maintain proper alignment along the show line (wind
   correction). Gradually increase backstick pressure to ensure aircraft will not descend below
   500 AGL. At no later than 1,200 AGL initiate full afterburner and begin a brisk but smooth
   wings-level pull to approximately 25-unit AOA. The second half is completed in the opposite
   direction using the procedures described earlier. A repositioning maneuver is performed to
   setup for the next pass.
   4.17.2. Abnormal Procedures. If either or both afterburners fail to light, or one or more
   gear remain extended, abort maneuver by decreasing pitch attitude to level flight and
   investigate malfunction. If apex airspeed is less than 150 knots, decrease backstick pressure
   and accelerate to target airspeed before reducing throttles and pulling nose through horizon.
   If desired pitch attitude is exceeded while inverted, roll upright and set desired pitch angle
   and continue maneuver. If less than 2,500 feet AGL while inverted, an immediate roll and
   pull to wings level will be initiated. If at any time it becomes apparent that the maneuver will
   be completed inside the show line (poor wind correction, improper alignment after the wing
   walk) abort the maneuver and setup for the next pass.

   4.18.1. Maneuver Description. Arrive at show center wings level, at 420 knots and 500
   feet AGL. Select full afterburner and begin a smooth 6.5 to 7.5 G wings-level pull to execute
   the first Immelmann. The pull is held until 10 degrees nose high, inverted, and wings level.
   Relax stick pressure and perform an unloaded 180-degree roll to a wings-level upright
   position. With greater than 250 knots perform a smooth wings-level pull to approximately 25
   units AOA for the second Immelmann. The second pull is also held until 10 degrees nose
   high, inverted, and wings level. Relax stick pressure and perform an unloaded 180-degree
   roll to a wings-level upright position. Altitude at the top should be approximately 6,500 feet
   AGL. Accelerate to 275 knots, terminate afterburner, and set up for the Split-S.
   4.18.2. Abnormal Procedures. If entry parameters are not achieved by show center, delay
   initial pull until parameters are met. If not met by 2,000 feet past show center, reposition for
   next maneuver. If less than 250 knots after rollout on the first Immelmann, delay the second
   pull until parameters are met. If less than 6,000 feet AGL at the completion of the maneuver,

   4.19.1. Maneuver Description. After completion of the Double Immelmann, with airspeed
   between 200 to 300 knots, and altitude >6,500 feet AGL, delay 15 seconds (no wind) while
   flying wings level on the extended show line. Adjust aircraft heading to maintain alignment
   on the extended show line (crosswind correction) and to setup for the Max Climb run-in.
   With the throttles in Mil or below, perform an unloaded roll to inverted flight and smoothly
   pull the nose of the aircraft down to achieve a pitch attitude of 90 degrees nose low. Hold this
   attitude until reaching 4,000 feet AGL, and then continue a smooth pull through the vertical,
   using 2 to 4 Gs to approximately 45 degrees nose low. On a standard day, at 90 degrees nose
   low, airspeed should be between 220 to 400 knots and altitude greater than 3,500 AGL. At
   this point, backpressure is relaxed and smoothly flown to be in level flight at 500 feet for the
   Max Climb. Power should be modulated in the descent to maintain at or below 450 knots.
   4.19.2. Abnormal Procedures. If not within the airspeed window, adjust pitch attitude
   and/or power to achieve desired airspeed. If below 6,000 feet AGL, climb as necessary
   before executing the Split-S. If you will be below 3,500 feet AGL and over 400 knots prior to
   achieving 90 degrees nose low, execute emergency dive recovery procedures. If at anytime
   during the maneuver it appears that the aircraft will not attain the prescribed altitude/airspeed
   parameters, the maneuver will be aborted. Roll out and/or pull to a wings-level position,
   initiate a descent and reposition the aircraft for follow-on maneuvering.

   knots and 300 feet AGL. At 2,000 feet prior to show center select full afterburner and initiate
   a 6.5 to 7.5 G wings-level pull to arrive at show center with 90 degrees of pitch. The pull
   should be made so the aircraft is vertical at show center. When the aircraft is vertical,
   perform high-rate unloaded aileron rolls until reaching a minimum of 225 knots or 2,500 feet
   below waivered airspace. Stop the aileron rolls and execute a vertical recovery by smoothly
   pulling the nose to the nearest horizon. Deselect afterburner and modulate power as
   necessary to setup for the spiral descent.
   4.20.2. Abnormal Procedures. If entry parameters are not met at 2,000 feet prior to show
   center, delay until entry parameters are met. If entry parameters are not met prior to 2,000
   feet past show center, abort the maneuver and reposition for the next pass. If it becomes
   apparent airspeed will decrease below 175 knots in the climb, initiate a vertical recovery.

   4.21.1. Maneuver Description. As the aircraft nose is brought through the horizon,
   reacquire the airshow environment. In idle power, perform a vertical spiraling descent
   oriented toward show center. Initiate dive recovery by 6,000 feet AGL. Do not exceed 450
   knots in the descent. The direction of the dive recovery should be as necessary to reposition
   for the next maneuver, however do not exit the maneuver over the crowd.
   4.21.2. Abnormal Procedures. If entry airspeed window is not met (too fast) adjust dive
   angle to minimize airspeed in the descent. If below 12,000 AGL at the apex of the climb
   (airspace restrictions, weather conditions), adjust dive angle to safely execute a recovery at
   6,000 AGL. When initiating the spiral descent at altitudes above 15,000 AGL, adjust
   minimum dive recovery altitude accordingly. (If starting at 18,000 AGL, initiate dive
   recovery at 9,000 AGL.) Initiate an immediate dive recovery if airspeed is at/or above 450
   knots. Show center orientation is a secondary consideration in the spiral descent. If at
   anytime during the maneuver it appears that the aircraft will not attain the prescribed
   altitude/airspeed parameters, the maneuver will be aborted. Roll out and/or pull to a wings-
   level position, initiate a descent and reposition the aircraft for follow-on maneuvering.
   OPTION: Due to changing weather conditions, the vertical spiraling descent may not be
   possible after the Max Climb. Start a descent when able to maintain VMC conditions to
   position the aircraft in front of the crowd to set-up for the next maneuver.
4.22. Dedication Pass. The intent of this maneuver is to pay tribute to our war fighters. It is to
be flown prior to the Knife Edge Pass during the High, Low, and Flat Show profiles.

   4.22.1. Maneuver Description. The maneuver is flown on the 500-foot line and is non-
   aerobatic. Following the Spiral Descent (high show) or Level Eight (low or flat show), attain
   a safe airspeed and reposition the aircraft to arrive behind and offset the crowd. The approach
   will be flown from behind the line, approximately 2 miles from show center, with an
   approximate 30 degree dive angle and a 45 degree cut (max bank angle 90 degrees) to the
   show line, remaining 500 feet from the crowd at all times. Upon reaching a point 500 feet
AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                              103


   from the corner of the crowd and 300 feet AGL, roll the aircraft into a level arcing pass using
   a max bank of 90 degrees. Use top rudder if necessary to maintain altitude. Select max power
   until passing the show line or until a target airspeed of .85M is anticipated. Varying pressure
   altitudes and temperatures will determine when to select afterburner to ensure the target
   airspeed is attained at show center and the max airspeed is not exceeded. Optimum profile of
   the aircraft is achieved at approximately 80 degrees of bank. Use caution not to over bank the
   aircraft and allow the aircraft to lose altitude while banking. In order to maintain 500 feet
   from the crowd at each corner, the flight path at show center will have to extend beyond 500
   feet. Continue the arc beyond the opposite crowd corner, reduce power as required, roll out
   of bank, and continue a maximum 45 degree climb to set up for the Knife Edge Pass.
   4.22.2. Abnormal Procedures. Abort the maneuver if at any time the aircraft comes closer
   than 500â€™ to the crowd line or its lateral limits, an excessive dive angle or sink rate develops,
   entry parameters are not met, or the aircraft descends below 200 feet AGL. Abort the
   maneuver by rolling the aircraft wings level and flying away from the crowd.

   4.23.1. Maneuver Description. Enter the 1,500â€™ show line at 500 feet AGL and 400 knots.
   At 4,000 feet prior to show center, raise the nose five to 10 degrees, establish a climb, and
   apply stick pressure to roll 90 degrees toward the crowd. The aircraft is held in this position
   until 4,000 feet past show center. Top rudder is applied to help hold the nose above the
   horizon so the full maneuver can be accomplished. Forward stick pressure is applied to keep
   the aircraft on the show line and to maintain level flight.
   4.23.2. Abnormal Procedures. If entry parameters are not met, abort the maneuver, make a
   flat pass and reposition for the next maneuver. If the nose falls below level flight (zero
   degrees pitch in the HUD) or if the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL, abort the
   maneuver.

   stick pressure. Perform an unloaded 405-degree aileron roll followed by an aggressive pull-
   up to downwind. During the pull to downwind, terminate afterburner and slow to below 300
   knots. Configure for and execute a normal final turn and landing.
       4.24.1.1. Option 1: On the pull-up to downwind, an additional 180-degree roll
       (reversal) may be performed to land from the opposite direction.
       4.24.1.2. Option 2: If a Heritage Flight is to be performed immediately following
       completion of the demonstration, conduct a low approach or wings-level pass and

   4.26.1. Maneuver Description. The takeoff is performed without flaps and in full
   afterburner. At 180 knots, execute a smooth, but brisk aft pull of the stick to achieve takeoff
   rotation. After a positive rate of climb is established, retract the gear and rotate the nose to
   achieve a 23-25 unit AOA climb (max AOA 25 units). Smoothly roll and pull away from the
   crowd to a wings-level inverted position with afterburners pointing directly at the crowd.
   Hold inverted flight for approximately five seconds, accelerate to 300 to 400 knots, and then
   perform a 270-degree right turn to position for the Flat Pass. Minimum airspeed in the climb
   will be 180 knots; minimum altitude inverted will be 1,000 feet. Option: From inverted
   flight, roll 180 degrees to a wings-level upright position. Delay for approximately 3- 5
   seconds, and then perform a left 270-degree roll to position for the Flat Pass.
   4.26.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the show profile takeoff is interrupted by an aircraft
   malfunction, make a normal takeoff, or if conditions warrant, abort the takeoff. If the takeoff
   is continued in a thrust-limited situation or if takeoff distance is critical, consider lowering
   the flaps. If the takeoff is aborted, consider lowering the flaps. Max abort speed and SETOS
   calculations are based on a flap-down configuration.
   NOTE: The Max Performance Takeoff/Inverted may be flown in either direction.
   NOTE: The Inverted Takeoff may be substituted for the Vertical Climb Takeoff at any
   time. Reasons are not limited to, but may include: takeoff direction due to wind and show
   orientation, weather considerations, terrain, or to demonstrate a different aircraft capability.
   The Inverted Takeoff is described in the low section.

   4.32.1. Maneuver Description. At approximately 1,500 feet past show center, select full
   afterburner and accelerate to approximately 420 knots. Turn away from the crowd using
   approximately 85 degrees of bank. Begin the turn with a smooth G onset-rate to maintain
   airspeed at approximately 400 knots and 7.5 Gs. G-loading and airspeed bleed-off rate will
   vary with density altitude. Maintain a minimum of 300 knots. The first 180 degrees of turn
   should be accomplished with a 1Â¾-degree nose-up attitude to make the turn appear level to
   the crowd. After 225 degrees of turn, unload and briskly roll wings level. Approaching the
   show line, reverse direction of turn and accomplish a second level turn in the opposite
   direction. Adjust power to enter the second turn with the same entry parameters as the first.
   Fly the second turn using the same techniques as the first. After 270 degrees and with a 45-
   degree cut to the show line, reverse the turn again. Vary the bank angle and pitch to arrive at
   level flight at the completion of the maneuver and to ensure the maneuver is finished above
   the entry altitude. Surface winds must be taken into careful consideration to center the
   maneuver over show center and to avoid overshooting the show line. Complete the maneuver
   by turning as required to finish on the show line heading the same direction as entry. Perform
   a repositioning maneuver to set-up for the next maneuver.
   4.32.2. Abnormal Procedures. Adjust power and G as required to avoid overshooting the
   show line. If the aircraft descends below 500 feet AGL, reorient lift vector to ensure a timely
   correction. If the aircraft descends below 400 feet AGL or the airspeed decays below 300
   knots, abort the maneuver by rolling wings level, climbing to 500 feet AGL, and
   repositioning for the follow-on maneuver.

Figure 4.22. F-15 Staged Show Sites.




   4.35.1. When demonstration aircraft takeoff from other than the show site, plan to arrive
   over the show site with the fuel requirements prescribed in paragraph 4.2 plus enroute
   return fuel IAW AFI 11-2F-15 Vol 3. The pilot may enter from behind the crowd at a
   minimum of 1,000 ft AGL as depicted in Figure 4.22, or via a Flat Pass maneuver down the
   show line, and complete the show as described in this chapter. Upon completion of the
   Dedication Pass and clearing the crowd, turn out behind the crowd and return to the staging
   airport. Pilots should plan to fly a full demonstration, but may cut the profile short as
   required to maintain suitable enroute return fuel.
4.36. F-15 No-Flap TOLD. The F-15 flying demonstration takeoff is performed in the flaps up
configuration. The effect of flaps on TOLD was investigated in the Boeing F-15 Simulator, with
the following (non-scientific) results.
   4.36.1. Effect of Flaps on Takeoff Distance. Takeoff distance was measured for an
   afterburner takeoff with flaps up and flaps down. Flap position had a negligible effect on
   takeoff distance. Conclusion: The thrust from afterburner on a clean jet overcomes any drag
   induced by flaps, and acceleration to takeoff speed is not affected by flap position.
   4.36.2. Effect of Flaps on Stopping Distance. Stopping distance was measured for a full
   AB acceleration to max abort speed followed by an abort with both engines in idle. For the
   acceleration portion, the distance was the same for flaps up and flaps down as discussed
   above. However, the stopping distance was significantly higher for the flaps-up
   configuration. The average increase in stopping distance was 1,200 feet with the flaps up
   compared to flaps-down. Conclusion: Flaps have a considerable effect on stopping distance
   due to aerodynamic drag.
AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                             113


  4.36.3. Effect of Flaps on SETOS. SETOS was measured by accelerating in AB to max
  abort speed, moving one throttle to cutoff, and noting the airspeed at which the aircraft can
  safely become airborne. For 700 F, flaps-down SETOS was 160 knots, while flaps-up
  SETOS was around 185 knots. This seems to correspond to the Dash-1 recommendation that,
  during a flaps-down single-engine takeoff with one engine windmilling, retract the gear when
  airborne, but delay flap retraction until 25 knots above SETOS. Conclusion: No-flap SETOS
  is approximately 25 knots greater than flaps-down SETOS.
  4.36.4. Effect of Flaps on Single-Engine Takeoff Distance. Single engine takeoff distance
  was measured by accelerating to max abort speed in AB, moving one throttle to cutoff,
  accelerating to SETOS, and measuring the distance from brake release at that point. Again,
  flap configuration had little effect on the acceleration portion, but a significant effect on the
  takeoff distance. For flaps up, the acceleration to no-flap SETOS and liftoff occurred an
  average of 1,200 feet further down the runway compared to flaps-down. Conclusion: The
  requirement to accelerate to a higher airspeed before taking off significantly increases the
  single engine takeoff distance in the no-flap configuration.
  4.36.5. Conclusions. The F-15 demo is often performed on short runways with no arresting
  gear available. A serious engine malfunction near max abort speed requires timely and
  precise action to avoid a runway departure situation. Because the F-15 Dash-1 only provides
  TOLD for the flaps-down configuration, demo pilots should use this TOLD, but consider the
  following for takeoff phase engine malfunctions:
     4.36.5.1. Max abort speed from the Dash-1 is only valid for flaps down. Flaps up may
     increase your stopping distance past the end of the runway. If performing a high-speed
     abort, consider lowering the flaps to minimize stopping distance.
     4.36.5.2. SETOS from the Dash-1 is only valid with flaps down. Attempting to takeoff at
     flaps-down SETOS may significantly delay liftoff. Acceleration to flaps-up SETOS 25
     knots higher will significantly increase takeoff distance. If you lose an engine, decide to
     continue the takeoff, and takeoff distance is critical, consider lowering the flaps to
     minimize the single-engine takeoff distance.

                          F-16 DEMONSTRATION MANEUVERS

Section 5Aâ€”General Information

5.1. General. Maneuvers described in this chapter will be used for training and for F-16 aerial
demonstrations. The demonstration sequence is designed so all of the maneuvers up to the High
Alpha Pass are performed in the same direction with respect to the crowd line. The High Alpha
Pass is designed to be flown against the wind. Abnormal procedures are written for each
maneuver. If the entry conditions are not met for any maneuver, a wings-level pass will be flown
and the pilot will transition to the next maneuver. Demonstration pilots will transmit parameters
prior to initiating the descending portion of vertical pull-throughs for the Split-S, Sharkâ€™s Tooth,
and Vertical Reposition maneuvers. These calls will be made when the pilot reaches apex of the
maneuver. Ground safety observer will monitor demonstration pilot altitude and airspeed radio
calls and direct an abort when parameter limits are exceeded. Following all maneuvers and
before clearing the show line to reposition for the next maneuver, the pilot will ensure any
descent has been stopped and the aircraft is in a climbing or level attitude with the flight path
marker at or above the horizon.
   5.1.1. (Added-ACC) F-16 Pyrotechnics. The F-16 demonstration will utilize pyrotechnics
   (pyro) only as a â€•Wall of Fireâ€– during the High Speed Pass. Only qualified personnel will be
   permitted to utilize pyrotechnics (pyro) in association with the ACC F-16 demonstration
   teams. Each calendar year the International Council of Airshow (ICAS) Pyro Safety
   Subcommittee identifies personnel as approved Shooters in Charge (SICs). Individualsâ€™
   selection will be based on experience, judgment, and safety record. Only those SICs selected
   by the ICAS Pyro Safety Subcommittee will be allowed to work with ACC demonstration
   teams.
       5.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) The following maximum Net Explosive Weights (NEW) will be
       used (all NEWs in this instruction are TNT equivalent):
           5.1.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) For the â€•Wall of Fireâ€– pass, the maximum NEW is
           dependent on the length of the wall. The maximum wall length is 2000 linear feet,
           and the maximum NEW is 20 pounds (spread out evenly). No more than 1 pound
           NEW will be used for each 100 linear feet of wall.
       5.1.1.2. (Added-ACC) The following items will be briefed by the ACC demonstration
       pilot and the SIC, in person, prior to each performance: (1) Exact dimensions of the
       pyrotechnics area and the magnitude of explosives being used. (2) Aircraft/pyro
       deconfliction plan. (3) Demonstration profile and sequence of pyro (wall of fire). (4)
       Forecast wind and effects on pyro. (5) Communications plan. (6) Knock-it-off (KIO)
       procedures. (7) Fire hazards and fire department response plan. (8) FOD potential and
       effects.
5.2. Aircraft Configuration and Fuel Requirements. Aircraft configuration for all
demonstrations will be clean (no wing pylons or missiles except wingtip smoke winders) and
internal fuel. Fuel considerations include: divert requirements, cable availability, temperature,
and density altitude. Normal minimum fuel for take-off is:
AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                              115


5.2. (ACC)Aircraft Configuration and Fuel Requirements. Aircraft configuration for all
capabilities demonstrations will be clean.
   5.2.1. Staged Show: 6,000 pounds.
   5.2.2. High Show: 5,000 pounds.
   5.2.3. Low Show: 4,000 pounds.
5.3. Airspeed and G Limits. Demonstration pilots will not exceed 0.94 Mach. The maximum
target G for this demonstration profile is 7.5 Gs. This does not preclude a momentary increase in
G for safety considerations.
5.4. Show line Restrictions. The majority of the F-16 demonstration will be flown on the
1,500-foot show line in reference to the distance from the crowd. Non-aerobatic maneuvers (less
than 90 degrees of bank) may be flown on the 500-foot show line unless specified in the
maneuver description.
5.5. Airspace and Runway Requirements. Required airspace for the F-16 is 15,000 feet AGL
and normally a five-mile radius from show center. The minimum dimensions of the aerobatic
box are 3,000 feet wide, 6,000 feet long, and up to 15,000 feet AGL (high show). If the FAA has
waived a show line to closer than 1,500 feet, the aerobatic box may be less than 3,000 feet wide,
provided there is at least 1,500 feet from the show line to the outer edges of the box. Minimum
runway length is 7,000 feet and width is 75 feet. The runway, taxiway, and parking area must be
stressed for a 30,000-pound aircraft with single wheel type landing gear.
5.6. Weather Requirements. Weather PARAMETER LIMITS for the high profile are a ceiling
of at least 7,000 feet and three miles ground and five miles in-flight visibility with a discernible
horizon. The low show profile ceiling is at least 2,500 feet. The flat show profile ceiling is at
least 1,500 feet. Maneuvers will be planned to maintain VMC throughout the show sequence.
5.7. High Density Altitude Demonstrations. For high density altitude shows, adjust
PARAMETER LIMITS in accordance with the following:
   5.7.1. Add 500 feet to APEX altitudes for each 2,000 feet of altitude above 3,000 feet MSL
   and 10 knots to airspeeds. For example, if the show site altitude is 5,000 feet MSL, add 500
   feet to the baseline target and 10 knots to the airspeed. If the show site altitude is 7,000 feet
   MSL, add 1,000 feet to the baseline target and 20 knots to the airspeed.

time during the demonstration sequence as required. Repositioning turns may not include added
aileron rolls or other accenting maneuvers.

Figure 5.1. F-16 Flat Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver.




   5.9.1. Flat Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn is a
   combination horizontal and shallow vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the
   show line when performing the low profile. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn uses less
   altitude than a normal reposition. It requires a larger cut and tends to be looser and flatter
   than a normal turn. The target G for this maneuver is 6.5 to 7.0 Gs. A 270-degree turn
   reversal may be made while the aircraft is climbing. Each turn may differ slightly so that
   airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the flat reposition. The
   entry "cut" turn for the flat reposition is made to ensure no show line or crowd line
   penetration.

Figure 5.2. F-16 Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver.




   5.9.2. Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. This maneuver is a combination horizontal and
   vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the show line. The vertical plane is used
   to maintain proximity to the demonstration area. Each turn may differ slightly so that
   airspeed/ altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the turn. As the aircraft
   departs the show line, maneuver in the horizontal and vertical plane to reposition for the next
   maneuver. The Target G for this maneuver is 6.0 to 7.0 Gs. A 270-degree rolling turn
   reversal is made while still climbing. During the last half of the maneuver, while descending,
   the turn is adjusted to establish the proper show line entry. The entry "cut" turn for the
   reposition is made to ensure no show line or crowd line penetration.
       5.9.2.1. Abnormal Procedures: Weather, terrain, obstacles, and winds into the show
       line must be considered when determining how much vertical and horizontal turning
       room is required for the reposition.

        5.9.3.1. Maneuver Description. The vertical reposition will be flown to change
        direction at each end of the show line during a high show. Upon passing show center or at
        the completion of the previous maneuver, a straight-ahead climb is commenced using a
        6.0 to 7.0 G pull to put the aircraft in a 55-degree nose high attitude. For slower entry
        parameters, use G as required to maintain a minimum of 150 KIAS. Power setting is
        based upon entry parameters to ensure a minimum airspeed of 150 KIAS in the climb.
        Pitch attitude may be reduced as well to hold airspeed. At a minimum of 3,000 feet AGL,
        the aircraft is rolled inverted and the demonstration pilot unloads the aircraft to attain or
        exceed the apex target altitude. Once apex parameters are assured, initiate an aggressive
        135-degree pull through the vertical, to approximately 45 degrees nose low. The peak
        altitude reached will be a minimum of 4,500 feet AGL with a target of 5,000 feet AGL.
        The throttle will be modulated as required to initiate the pull down with a target airspeed
        of 275 KIAS. Once recovery above the minimum altitude for the follow on maneuver is
        assured, backpressure is relaxed and the aircraft is smoothly flown to be in level flight at
        the entry altitude for the next maneuver. In no circumstances should the demonstration
        pilot play the G during the 135-degree pull through the vertical.
        5.9.3.2. Abnormal Procedures. If entry parameters are not attained, reposition in the
        oblique for follow-on maneuvers. If apex parameters are not achieved with regard to
        airspeed or altitude, immediately recover the aircraft to the nearest horizon and abort the
        split-S. If the airspeed exceeds 350 KIAS during any portion of the dive or is below 3,000
        feet AGL at 90 degrees nose low, immediately initiate a dive recovery to the nearest
        horizon.

       5.9.4.1. Maneuver Description. The flat pass is a repositioning maneuver used alone or
       in combination with an oblique reposition for the primary purpose of orienting the
       subsequent demonstration maneuver in the approved direction relative to the crowd line.
       The Flat Pass may be flown in either direction at any time during the demonstration
       sequence if required. It should be flown IAW paragraph 5.11.

   5.10.1. Maneuver Description. Takeoff will not be attempted when the takeoff roll exceeds
   80 percent of available runway. The takeoff is made in full afterburner. After takeoff,
   establish a positive rate of climb and raise the gear, at a minimum of 300 knots begin a
   wings-level 4.0 to 6.0 G pull. Hold the pull until 90 degrees of pitch, then release the
   backpressure to approximately 2.5 G until 25 to 35 degrees nose high inverted. Play the
   backpressure to ensure the over-the-top airspeed and altitude are above 150 knots and 3,000
   feet AGL. Continue the pull until 25 to 45 degrees nose low inverted. Unload to hold pitch,
   deselect afterburner, and perform an unloaded 1/2 roll to a wings-level upright. At 2,000 feet
   AGL, modulate power as required and begin a four to six-G wings-level pull to arrive on the
   show line at 500 feet AGL with 350 knots. If the direction of takeoff is left to right,
   accomplish the second half of a Cuban 8 using an entry airspeed of approximately 350 knots,
   an entry pull of 4.0 to 6.0 Gs and over-the-top minimum of 150 knots. The descending
   portion of the second half is accomplished exactly as the descending portion of the first half.
   If the direction of takeoff is right to left, accomplish the first half of the Cuban 8 only.
   5.10.2. Abnormal procedures. If entry parameters are not attained, clear the show line in
   front of the crowd. If at any time during the maneuver it appears the minimum over-the-top
   altitude or airspeed parameters will not be met, the maneuver will be aborted by performing
   an unloaded roll to the wings-level upright position accelerating to 250 knots in afterburner
   and continuing down the show line. If desired pitch attitude is exceeded while inverted, roll
   upright and set desired pitch angle and continue maneuver. If less than 2,500 feet AGL while
   inverted, an immediate roll and pull to wings level will be initiated. If at any time it becomes
   apparent that the maneuver will be completed inside the show line (poor wind correction,
   improper alignment) abort the maneuver and setup for the next pass.
   5.10.3. The Cuban 8 is a transition point to the low profile, if required by changing weather.

   5.12.1. Maneuver Description. At 3,500 feet prior to show center with approximately 425
   knots raise the nose to 5-7 degrees pitch attitude, establish a climb, and relax stick pressure to
   approximately 0.8 Gs. Apply left stick pressure to perform a maximum of three consecutive
   unloaded aileron rolls. Crosscheck the horizon and audibly count the rolls during the
   maneuver. As you complete the second roll, ensure the aircraft has gained altitude and that
   the flight path marker is above the horizon line in the HUD. If not, abort the maneuver and
   recover the aircraft above the minimum altitude. If you lose count of the number of rolls or
   experience roll-coupling immediately abort the maneuver. In all cases, the rolls will be
   completed at a higher altitude than entry. After rolling out wings level upon completion of
   the third roll, smoothly apply aft stick pressure as required to finish the maneuver at entry
   altitude (the objective of the maneuver is to make the pass look symmetrical to the crowd).
   Then perform a repositioning maneuver to prepare for the next maneuver.
   5.12.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the minimum entry parameters are not met, transition to a
   wings-level flat pass. At wings level following the second roll, abort the maneuver if the
   flight path marker is not above the horizon line. Abort the maneuver if you lose count of the
   rolls during the sequence.

   5.13.1. Maneuver Description. Just prior to show center select full AB and accelerate to
   400 knots. At show center, turn away from the crowd using approximately 85 degrees of
   bank. Begin the turn with a smooth G onset-rate to approximately 7.5 Gs. G-loading and
   airspeed bleed-off rate will vary with density altitude. Maintain a minimum of 250 knots. The
   first 180 degrees of turn should be accomplished with a 1Â¾-degree nose-up attitude and the
   last 180 degrees should be accomplished with a 1Â¾-degree nose-down attitude to make the
   turn appear level to the crowd. Vary the bank angle and pitch to arrive at level flight at the
   completion of 360 degrees of turn and to ensure the maneuver is finished above the entry
   altitude. Surface winds must be taken into consideration in order to center this maneuver on
   show center and to avoid overshooting the show line. As you approach show center,
   smoothly but briskly roll out. Perform a repositioning maneuver to prepare for the next
   maneuver.
   5.13.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the minimum entry parameters are not met, the pilot will
   transition to a wings-level flat pass. If during any portion of the maneuver it becomes
   apparent the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL or airspeed decay below 250 knots,
   abort the maneuver by rolling wings level and climbing to 500 feet AGL. If necessary, adjust
   power and G as required (no lower than 250 knots) to avoid overshooting the show line.

   5.14.1. Maneuver Description. At 3,000 feet prior to show center, rotate the nose five to
   seven degrees nose up, establish a climb, and relax stick pressure. A cadence four-point roll
   to the left is then performed by pausing momentarily at the 90-degree, 180-degree, 270-
   degree, and 360-degree points. The pace of the cadence should ensure the aircraft is at the
   180-degree point over show center. In all cases, the roll will be completed at a higher altitude
   than it starts. Move the stick briskly, initiating a left roll and an immediate stop at the proper
   90-degree point when pressure is released. Upon returning to wings level, smoothly apply aft
   stick pressure as required to finish the maneuver at entry altitude (the objective of the
   maneuver is to make the pass look symmetrical to the crowd). At the completion of the pass,
   a repositioning maneuver is performed to set up for the next maneuver.
   5.14.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the minimum entry parameters are not met, the pilot will
   transition to a wings-level flat pass. If the flight path marker is below the horizon line at the
   wings-level inverted position, an immediate roll to the upright position will be made (abort),
   clearing the show line past the end of the crowd line. NOTE: The Four-Point Roll is a
   transition point to the Low Show Profile if changing weather conditions require.

   5.15.1. Maneuver Description. Just prior to show center and wings level, select full
   afterburner and begin a smooth 6.5 to 7.5 G wings-level pull to execute the first Immelmann.
   The pull is held until inverted wings level. Relax stick pressure and perform an unloaded
   180-degree roll to a wings-level upright position. Accelerate to 300 knots and initiate a 4 to 6
   G pull to perform the second Immelmann. Roll out to a wings-level upright position from the

   5.16.1. Maneuver Description. With Mil power or less, proceed to the end of the show line
   (approx 6,000 feet). At 175 knots and 6,000 feet AGL, roll inverted, perform an aggressive
   135-degree pull through vertical to approximately 45 degrees nose low, to reenter the show
   line from left to right at a minimum of 500 feet AGL. The throttle should be modulated as
   required to initiate the pull down with target airspeed of 175 KIAS. Once recovery above the
   minimum altitude for the follow-on maneuver is assured, backpressure is relaxed and the
   aircraft smoothly flown to be in level flight at the entry altitude for the next maneuver.
   5.16.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the entry parameters are not met, the pilot will transition
   to a wings-level flat pass. If parameter limits cannot be maintained at any point during the
   maneuver, recover the aircraft to wings level and clear in front of the line. Do not attempt to
   pull down from the inverted apex below 5,000 feet AGL or with more than 350 KIAS. At 90
   degrees nose low, max airspeed is 350 KIAS and minimum altitude is 3,000 feet AGL. If
   either is exceeded, execute a dive recovery IAW tech order procedures.

   5.17.1. Maneuver Description. This maneuver may be initiated at the 500-foot show line.
   Enter the show line at 500 feet AGL and 400 knots. Just prior to show center select full
   afterburner and perform a 6.5 to 7.5 G slightly climbing turn (20 to 30 degrees pitch angle)
   left away from the crowd. After 90 degrees of turn, reverse the direction of the turn to the
   right by unloading and rolling under 180 degrees. Perform a 6.5 to 7.5 G right slightly
   descending turn (10 to 20 degrees nose low) for 270 degrees rolling out heading the opposite
   direction with a minimum of 250 knots. Accelerate down the show line at 500 feet AGL in
   preparation for the next maneuver.
   5.17.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the minimum entry parameters are not met, the pilot will
   transition to a wings-level flat pass. If during any portion of the maneuver it becomes
   apparent the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL or overshoot 30 degrees nose low, the
   maneuver will be aborted by rolling wings level and climbing to 500 feet AGL. If it becomes
   apparent the aircraft will overshoot the show line, use airspeed and G as required (no lower
   than 250 knots) to prevent the overshoot. NOTE: The Falcon Turn is a transition point to the
   Low Profile if required by changing weather conditions.

   5.18.1. Maneuver Description. This maneuver is a three-sided square loop with the third
   corner at a 135-degree angle. It avoids the pure vertical recovery in the last corner of a
   normal square loop. At 2,000 feet past show center, select afterburner and perform a 6.5 to
   7.5 G pull to 90 degrees nose high. Maintain full afterburner in the climb to 4,500 feet AGL,
   and then perform a 5.0 to 7.0 G pull of 90 degrees to inverted. Roll out to wings level upright
   and maintain 250 knots. At 2,000 feet past show center, roll inverted, select power as
   required and perform a 5.0 to 7.0 G pull to 90 degrees nose low. Approaching 4,500 feet to
   3,500 feet AGL, at a maximum of 350 KIAS, continue to pull to 45 degrees nose low
   upright. Hold until reaching 2,000 feet AGL, and then perform a descending turn away from
   the crowd. Turn left or right to set up on the appropriate 1,000 feet downwind for the High
   Alpha pass into the wind.
   5.18.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the minimum entry parameters are not met, the pilot will
   transition to a wings-level flat pass. Do not attempt to pull down from the inverted apex
   below 5,000 feet AGL or with more than 350 KIAS. If out of the maneuver envelope,
   perform a roll to wings-level upright and make a descending turn away from the crowd to set
   up on a downwind position for the High Alpha pass. At 90 degrees nose low, max airspeed is
   350 KIAS and minimum altitude is 3,000 feet AGL. If either is exceeded, execute a dive
   recovery IAW tech order procedures.

   5.19.1. Maneuver Description. During the turn to the 500-foot show line following the
   sharkâ€™s tooth maneuver, use speed brakes and G as required to gradually slow the airspeed
   and attain 125 knots and 500â€™ AGL by 2,000 feet prior to show center. As the aircraft rolls
   out on the show line, ensure the speed brakes are retracted, smoothly bring the nose up and
   use power as required to achieve the target parameters. Use the Gun Cross in the HUD in
   relation to the pitch ladders to achieve the target AOA. As a technique, select VVI in the
   HUD to help achieve level flight, as the tendency is to climb during the maneuver. Maintain
   the desired ground track by looking out the sides of the canopy and cross checking the
   desired heading in the HUD and/or HSI. To complete the maneuver, select full afterburner
   and transition to the muscle climb in accordance with paragraph 5.20.
   5.19.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the minimum entry parameters are not met, transition to a
   wings-level flat pass. If the airspeed falls below 115 knots or a descent rate develops, select
   full afterburner and perform a normal go-around procedure.

   5.20.1. Maneuver Description. Passing show center, simultaneously select full afterburner
   and pull up to establish approximately 55-degree nose high attitude using 1.5 â€“ 1.8 Gs. The
   afterburner must light in order to execute this maneuver and allow the aircraft to accelerate to
   maintain a minimum of 150 KIAS in the climb. Pitch attitude may be reduced to hold
   airspeed. The demonstration pilot may then transition to a Wifferdill or Vertical Reposition
   Maneuver (VRM) as required when adjusting to the show line for subsequent maneuvers. If a
   VRM is flown, the demonstration pilot will adhere to the apex and 90-degree nose low
   parameters listed in Table 5.12 above and the procedures for a VRM as described in
   paragraph 5.9.3.1. Once recovery above the minimum altitude for the follow on maneuver
   is assured, backpressure is relaxed and power modulated to smoothly transition to level flight
   at the entry altitude for the next maneuver.
   5.20.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the airspeed falls below the minimum of 150 knots, a
   nose high recovery should be accomplished. If the airspeed exceeds 350 KIAS during any
   portion of a follow-on VRM or if the aircraft is below 3,000 feet AGL at 90 degrees nose
   low, immediately initiate a dive recovery to the nearest horizon.

   At 4,000 feet prior to show center, raise the nose to five to seven degrees, establish a climb,
   and apply stick pressure to roll 90 degrees toward the crowd. Hold this attitude until 4,000
   feet past show center. Use top rudder to hold the nose above the horizon and forward stick
   pressure to keep the aircraft on the show line. To complete the maneuver, unload, roll wings
   level, and perform a repositioning maneuver.
   5.21.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the minimum entry parameters are not met, transition to a
   wings-level flat pass. If it becomes apparent the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL,
   roll out of the bank and clear the show line.
   5.21.3. Transition point to the High Profile, if changing weather conditions permit. NOTE:

   5.22.1. Maneuver Description. Enter with a minimum of 330 knots at 300 feet AGL
   approaching show center 135 degrees to the crowd line, but with the flight path not directed
   toward the crowd. At 3,000 feet prior to show center select full afterburner and initiate a 6.5
   to 7.5-G wings-level pull to arrive at show center with 90 degrees of pitch. The pull should
   be made so the aircraft is vertical at show center. When the aircraft is vertical, perform high
   rate unloaded aileron rolls until reaching a minimum of 250 knots or 2,500 feet below
   wavered airspace. Every precaution must be taken to avoid slow airspeed in an exaggerated
   pitch attitude due to the potential of "pitch hang-up." Stop the aileron rolls and execute a
   vertical recovery by smoothly pulling the nose to the nearest horizon to prevent exceeding
   waivered airspace. Modulate power and speed brakes as required while performing the
   descending portion of a repositioning maneuver to enter the show line for the Tactical Pitch-
   Up to Landing.
   5.22.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the minimum entry parameters are not met, transition to a
   wings-level, flat pass. If roll coupling occurs during the climb (to exceed approximately 2.5
   G), smoothly stop the roll, then pull to the nearest horizon, and roll upright. Initiate an
   immediate recovery to the nearest horizon if airspeed decays to 250 KIAS minimum or
   altitude reaches 2,500 feet below the top of waivered airspace.

   5.23.1. Maneuver Description. As the aircraft nose is brought through the horizon,
   reacquire the air show environment and perform the spiraling descent oriented toward show
   center. In idle power, allow the nose to fall below 45 degrees nose low. Once established,
   apply back stick pressure and roll simultaneously to maintain at least 200 knots initially in a
   spiraling dive, ensuring airspeed of 250-440 knots prior to initiating the recovery. At
   approximately 5,000â€™ AGL, adjust dive angle and roll in order to be wings-level, less than 45
   degrees nose low at the planned altitude of 4000â€™. The maneuver is complete when the dive
   angle is less than 45 degrees. Continue a descent as required to reposition for the next
   maneuver, however do not perform or exit the maneuver over the crowd. Do not exceed 440
   knots in the descent. The airspeed window of 250-440 at maneuver exit allows the pilot the
   flexibility to show the F-16s maneuvering ability early in the maneuver while gaining energy
   at or below corner velocity to set up for the next maneuver â€“ the Dedication Pass.
   5.23.2. Abnormal Procedures: If below 8,000â€™ AGL at the apex of the climb (airspace
   restrictions, weather conditions), adjust dive angle to safely execute a recovery at 4,000â€™
   AGL. Initiate an immediate dive recovery if airspeed exceeds 440 knots. Show center
   orientation is a secondary consideration in the spiral descent; do not continue the maneuver
   below min altitude to attempt a specific orientation in the airshow environment. If at any time
   during the maneuver it appears that the aircraft will not attain the prescribed altitude/airspeed
   parameters, the maneuver will be aborted. Roll out and/or pull to a wings- level position,
   initiate a descent and reposition the aircraft for follow-on maneuvering. OPTION: Due to
   changing weather conditions, the vertical spiraling descent may not be possible after the Max
   Performance Climb. Start a descent when able to maintain VMC conditions to position the
   aircraft for the next maneuver.

   behind and offset the crowd. The approach will be flown from behind the line, approximately
   2 miles from show center, with an approximate 30 degree dive angle and a 45 degree cut
   (max bank angle 90 degrees) to the show line, remaining 500 feet from the crowd at all
   times. Upon reaching a point 500 feet from the corner of the crowd and 300 feet AGL, roll
   the aircraft into a level arcing pass using a max bank of 90 degrees. Use top rudder if
   necessary to maintain altitude. Select max power until passing the show line or until a target
   airspeed of .85M is anticipated. Varying pressure altitudes and temperatures will determine
   when to select afterburner to ensure the target airspeed is attained at show center and the max
   airspeed is not exceeded. Optimum profile of the aircraft is achieved at approximately 80
   degrees of bank. Use caution not to over bank the aircraft and allow the aircraft to lose
   altitude while banking. In order to maintain 500 feet from the crowd at each corner, the flight
   path at show center will have to extend beyond 500 feet. Continue the arc beyond the
   opposite crowd corner, reduce power as required, roll out of bank, and continue a maximum
   45 degree climb to set up for the Tactical Pitch-up to Landing.
   5.24.2. Abnormal Procedures. Abort the maneuver if at any time the aircraft comes closer
   than 500â€™ to the crowd line or its lateral limits, an excessive dive angle or sink rate develops,
   entry parameters are not met, or the aircraft descends below 200 feet AGL. Abort the
   maneuver by rolling the aircraft wings level and flying away from the crowd.

   5.25.1. Maneuver Description. Enter the show line at 500 feet AGL and 350 knots. At
   2,000 feet prior to show center raise the nose to five to seven degrees pitch angle, unload, and
   perform a 405-degree aileron roll away from the crowd followed by a 5.0 to 7.5-G pull-up to
   downwind using afterburner. Configure for and execute a normal final turn and landing.
   Option: If a Heritage Flight is to be performed immediately following completion of the
   demonstration, conduct a low approach or wings-level pass and proceed to rejoin with
   Heritage Flight aircraft using pre-briefed procedures.
   5.25.2. Abnormal Procedures. If entry parameter limits are not achieved by show center,
   the 405-degree aileron roll will not be performed and a simple pull-up to a normal closed
   pattern will be flown.

   5.27.1. Maneuver Description. Takeoff will not be attempted when the takeoff roll exceeds
   80 percent of available runway length. If airfield conditions permit, a brake release point
   should be selected so takeoff occurs at show center. The show-center takeoff point is a
   secondary consideration to determining critical field length, abort criteria, etc. In no case will
   the takeoff be initiated with less than 6,000 feet of runway remaining. The takeoff is made in
   full afterburner. Ensure a positive rate of climb is established after takeoff. Once the gear is
   retracted, a three to five-degree nose high climb is made while accelerating to 400 knots. At
   this point, maintain afterburner and begin an energy sustaining pitch-up to 500 feet AGL,
   using 5.0 to 7.0 Gs, turning away from the crowd. After 225 degrees of turn, unload and
   reverse the direction of turn and perform a second level turn in the opposite direction. After
   270 degrees with a 45-degree cut to the show line, the turn is again reversed. Vary the bank
   angle and pitch to arrive at level flight at the completion of the maneuver and to ensure the
   maneuver is finished above the entry altitude. Complete the maneuver by turning to finish on
   the show line heading in the same direction as takeoff. Surface winds must be taken into
   consideration in order to center this maneuver on show center and to avoid overshooting the
   show line. Once on the show line, execute a repositioning maneuver to prepare for either a
   Flat Pass (left to right takeoff) or the Triple Aileron Roll (right to left takeoff).
   5.27.2. Abnormal Procedures. If, during any portion of the maneuver it becomes apparent
   the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL or airspeed will decay below 250 knots, abort
   the maneuver by rolling wings level, climbing to 500 feet AGL, and clearing the show line.
 152                                              AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011


   Use power and G as required (no lower than 250 knots) to prevent the aircraft from
   overshooting the show line.
5.28. Flat Pass (Right to Left). If the direction of takeoff is left to right, the repositioning
maneuver following the horizontal Cuban 8 will be used to prepare for a flat pass as described in
paragraph 5.11.1. At 2,000 feet past show center, execute a repositioning maneuver to set up for
the next maneuver.
5.29. Triple Aileron Roll (Left to right). The triple aileron roll will be performed as described
in paragraph 5.12.1. When wings level following the last aileron roll, the pilot performs a
repositioning maneuver to set up for the next maneuver.
5.30. High G Turn (Right to Left). The high G turn will be performed as described in
paragraph 5.13.1. At 2,000 feet past show center, perform a repositioning maneuver to set up
for the next maneuver.
5.31. Four-Point Roll (Left to Right). The four-point roll is performed as described in
paragraph 5.14.1. At the completion of the pass, execute a repositioning maneuver to set up for
the next maneuver. NOTE: Transition to the High Profile if changing weather conditions permit.
5.32. Knife Edge Pass. The Knife Edge Pass will be performed as in paragraph 5.21.1 At the
completion of the pass, execute a reposition maneuver to set up for the next maneuver. NOTE:
Transition to the High Profile if changing weather conditions permit.
5.33. Falcon Turn (Right to Left). The Falcon Turn is performed as described in paragraph
5.17.1. At the completion of the maneuver, pull up to a downwind to prepare for the slow speed
pass against the wind. If the wind favors a right to left final, a normal 180-degree pitch-up to
downwind is performed. NOTE: Transition to the high profile if changing weather conditions
permit
5.34. High Alpha Pass (Into the wind). This maneuver may be flown on the 500-foot show
line. The High Alpha pass is performed as described in paragraph 5.19.1. At 3,000 feet past
show center, perform a repositioning maneuver to set up for the next maneuver. NOTE:
Transition to the High Profile if changing weather conditions permit.
5.35. Flat Pass. The flat pass is performed as described in paragraph 5.11.1.
5.36. Tactical Pitch-Up to Landing. The tactical pitch-up to landing is performed as described
in paragraph 5.25.1.

Figure 5.22. F-16 Staged Show Sites.




   5.37.1. When demonstration aircraft takeoff from other than the show site, plan to arrive
   over the show site with the fuel requirements prescribed in paragraph 5.2 plus enroute
   return fuel IAW AFI 11-2F-16 Vol 3. The pilot may enter from behind the crowd at a
   minimum of 1000 ft AGL as depicted in Figure 5.22, or via a Flat Pass maneuver down the
   show line, and complete the show as described in this chapter. Upon completion of the
   Dedication Pass and clearing the crowd, turn out behind the crowd and return to the staging
   airport. Pilots should plan to fly a full demonstration, but may cut the profile short as
   required to maintain suitable enroute return fuel.
5.38. (Added-ACC) Maneuver Description â€“ Pyro. Prior to the start of the F-16
demonstration, the demonstration pilot or team safety observer will get a radio check with the
SIC. Radio contact will only be initiated by the demonstration pilot or safety observer, and in no
instance will the SIC talk to the pilot unless safety of flight becomes an issue. Following the
Cuban 8, the demonstration pilot will make a â€•next pass hotâ€– call. This will alert the SIC to the
High Speed Pass maneuver and give the SIC permission to discharge the pyrotechnics as briefed.
The pilotâ€™s responsibility is to fly the demonstration without distraction, and radio calls between
the safety observer and the SIC will be kept to the absolute minimum necessary. The turn or
vertical pull initiating the aircraft reposition following the High Speed Pass is the timing cue to
discharge the â€•Wall of Fireâ€–.
   5.38.1. (Added-ACC) Deconfliction with the aircraft will be based on altitude, timing and
   lateral offsets. SIC will not fire the pyro until the F-16 has pulled vertical and begun a
   positive rate of climb, or begun the reposition turn away from the crowd line. The F-16 will
   fly a ground track that is offset at least 150 feet from the F-16 pyro effect and over fly the
   pyro by at least 300 feet AGL. IAW AFMAN 91-201, explosives safety standards dictate a
154                                              AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011


  minimum of 1250 feet separation from Hazard C/D 1.1 explosive detonations to unrelated
  personnel. Therefore, at all Air Force Bases, pyro will be set up a minimum of 1250 feet
  from the crowd line. The demonstration pilot may continue the demonstration on the 500-
  foot show line. For all non-Air Force Base show sites, pyro will be set up a minimum of 650
  feet from the crowd line, allowing the aircraft to fly on the 500-foot show line.
  5.38.2. (Added-ACC) Abnormal Procedures â€“ Pyro. Safety is paramount. If at any time
  safety becomes an issue, anyone on the radio may make a KIO call. Following a KIO call,
  the pilot will discontinue his routine and the pilot, safety observer, and SIC will acknowledge
  the call. If there is ever a question of timing, safety, or sequence, the SIC will not shoot the
  pyro.
AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                               155

                          F-15E DEMONSTRATION MANEUVERS

Section 6Aâ€”General Information

6.1. General. Maneuvers described in this chapter will be used for training and for F-15E aerial
demonstrations. The demonstration sequence is designed so each maneuver is normally flown in
the same direction with respect to the crowd line with the following exceptions: Flat Pass, the
first Split-S, and the aileron roll preceding the tactical pitch to landing. As a result, the show is
always oriented the same way from the spectators' point of view. Abnormal procedures are
written for each maneuver. If the entry conditions are not met for any maneuver, a wings-level
pass will be flown and the pilot will transition to the next maneuver. Demonstration pilots will
transmit parameters prior to initiating the descending portion of vertical pull-throughs for the
Split-S and Vertical Reposition Maneuvers. These calls will be made when the pilot reaches apex
of the maneuver. Ground safety observer and the WSO will monitor demonstration pilot altitude
and airspeed radio calls and direct an abort when parameter limits are exceeded. Following all
maneuvers and before clearing the show line to reposition for the next maneuver, the pilot will
ensure any descent has been stopped and the aircraft is in a climbing or level attitude with the
flight path marker at or above the horizon.
6.1.1. ((Added)-ACC) Abnormal Procedures â€“ Pyro. Only qualified personnel will be
permitted to utilize pyrotechnics (pyro) in association with the ACC F-15E demonstration teams.
Each calendar year the ICAS Pyro Safety Subcommittee identifies personnel as approved
Shooters in Charge (SICs). Individualsâ€™ selection will be based on experience, judgment, and
safety record. Only those SICs approved by the ICAS Pyro Safety Subcommittee will be
allowed to work with ACC demonstration teams.

       6.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) The following maximum Net Explosive Weights (NEW) will be
       used (all NEWs in this instruction are TNT equivalent):
           6.1.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) For marking shot during initial repositioning maneuver, a
           maximum NEW of 2 pounds will be used. The marking shot should simulate smoke,
           not fire.
           6.1.1.1.2. (Added-ACC) For strafe passes, a series of between 40 to 60 charges will
           be fired, with a maximum of one pound NEW each. The â€•ending shotâ€– for each
           strafe pass will be a maximum two-pound NEW charge. Minimum delays are 24ms
           each with maximum delays of 40ms.
           6.1.1.1.3. (Added-ACC) For bomb passes, a maximum NEW of 5 pounds will be
           used.
           6.1.1.1.4. (Added-ACC) For the â€•Wall of Fireâ€– pass, the maximum NEW is
           dependent on the length of the wall. The maximum wall length is 2000 linear feet,
           and the maximum NEW is 20 pounds (spread out evenly). No more than 1 pound
           NEW will be used for each 100 linear feet of wall.
 156                                                AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011


       6.1.1.2. (Added) The following items will be briefed by the ACC demonstration pilot
       and the SIC, in person, prior to each performance:


Exact dimensions of the pyrotechnics area and the magnitude of explosives being used.
Aircraft/pyro deconfliction plan.
Demonstration profile and sequence of pyro (marking, strafe, wall of fire, etc).
Forecast wind and effects on pyro.
Communications plan.
Knock-it-off (KIO) procedures.
Fire hazards and fire department response plan.
FOD potential and effects.

6.2. Aircraft Configuration and Fuel Requirements. Aircraft configuration for all
demonstrations will be clean with CFTs, no wing pylons on stations 2 and 8, no LANTIRN pods,
no external fuel tanks, and no travel pods. Fuel considerations include: divert requirements,
cable availability, temperature, and density altitude. Normal minimum fuel for takeoff is:
   6.2.1. Staged Show: 16,500 pounds
   6.2.2. High Show: 14,000 pounds
   6.2.3. Low Show: 13,000 pounds
6.3. Airspeed and G Limits. Demonstration pilots will not exceed 0.94 Mach. The maximum
target G for this demonstration is 7.5 Gs. This does not preclude a momentary increase in G for
safety considerations.
6.4. Show line Restrictions. The majority of the F-15E demonstration will be flown on the
1,500-foot show line in reference to the distance from the crowd. Non-aerobatic maneuvers (less
than 90 degrees of bank) may be flown on the 500-foot show line unless specified in the
maneuver description.
6.5. Airspace and Runway Requirements. Required airspace for the F-15E is 15,000 feet
AGL and normally a five-mile radius from show center horizontally. The minimum dimensions
of the aerobatic box are 3,000 feet wide, 6,000 feet long, and 15,000 feet AGL (high show). If
the FAA has waived a show line to closer than 1,500 feet, the aerobatic box may be less than
3,000 feet wide, provided there is at least 1,500 feet from the show line to the outer edges of the
box. Minimum runway length is 7,000 feet x 75 feet. The runway, taxiway, and parking area
must be stressed for a 62,000-pound aircraft with single wheel type landing gear. If needed, on a
case by case basis, the absolute minimum weight allowable is 52,000-pounds with no CFT gas.
6.6. Weather Requirements. Weather PARAMETER LIMITS for the high profile are a ceiling
of at least 7,000 feet, three miles ground and five miles in-flight visibility with a discernible
horizon. Ceiling required for the low profile is 2,500 feet. The flat show profile ceiling is at least
1,500 feet. Maneuvers will be planned to maintain VMC throughout the show sequence.
6.7. High Density Altitude Demonstrations. For high density altitude shows, adjust
PARAMETER LIMITS in accordance with the following:
AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                              157


   6.7.1. Add 500 feet to APEX altitudes for each 2,000 feet of altitude above 3,000 feet MSL
   and 10 knots to airspeeds. For example, if the show site altitude is 5,000 feet MSL, add 500
   feet to the baseline target and 10 knots to the airspeed. If the show site altitude is 7,000 feet
   MSL, add 1,000 feet to the baseline target and 20 knots to the airspeed.

time during the demonstration sequence as required. Repositioning turns may not include added
aileron rolls or other accenting maneuvers.

Figure 6.1. F-15E Flat Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver.




   6.9.1. Flat Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn is a
   combination horizontal and shallow vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the
AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                             159


   show line when performing the low profile. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn uses less
   altitude than a normal Wifferdill. It requires a larger cut and tends to be looser and flatter
   than a normal Wifferdill. 270-degree turn reversal may be made while the aircraft is
   climbing. The target G for this maneuver is 6.5 to 7.0 Gs. Each turn may differ slightly so
   that airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the flat Wifferdill.
   The entry "cut" turn for the flat Wifferdill is typically made away from the crowd. However
   if local conditions dictate, the turn may be made toward the crowd side, provided the aircraft
   is beyond the corner marker (500' past the edge of the crowd) to ensure no show line or
   crowd line penetration.

Figure 6.2. F-15E Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver.




   6.9.2. Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. The Wifferdill turn is a combination horizontal
   and vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the show line. The vertical plane is
   used to maintain necessary proximity to the demonstration area. Each turn may differ slightly
   so that airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the Wifferdill.
   As the aircraft departs the show line, maneuver in the horizontal and vertical plane to
   reposition for the next maneuver. The target G for this maneuver is 6.5 to 7.0 Gs. A 270-
   degree turn reversal is made while still climbing. During the last half of the Wifferdill, while
   descending, the turn is adjusted to establish the proper show line entry. The entry "cut" turn
   for the Wifferdill is typically made away from the crowd. However if local conditions

   dictate, the turn may be made toward the crowd side, provided the aircraft is beyond the
   corner marker (500' past the edge of the crowd) to ensure no show line or crowd line
   penetration.

   6.9.3. Vertical Reposition Maneuver. The Vertical Reposition Maneuver may be flown to
   change direction at each end of the show line. Upon passing show center or at the completion
   of the previous maneuver with a minimum of 350 knots, begin a straight-ahead climb using
   6.5 to 7.0 Gs to put the aircraft in a 40 to 55-degree nose high attitude. At a minimum of
   4,500 feet AGL, perform an unloaded 180-degree roll to achieve an inverted climbing
   attitude. Initiate a smooth pull to the horizon to achieve a wings-level inverted position at or
   above 5,500 feet AGL. Continue the pull in maximum power though the vertical, using 3.0-
   5.0 Gs to 135 degrees of turn (45 degrees nose low). As the nose drops below the horizon and
   the airfield environment is reacquired, correct as necessary to complete the Vertical
   Reposition Maneuver down the show line. On a standard day, at 90 degrees nose low,
   airspeed should be between 300 to 400 knots and altitude greater than 4,000 feet AGL. At
   135 degrees, backpressure is relaxed and the aircraft smoothly flown to be in level flight at
   500 feet AGL for the next maneuver. Aircraft power should be modulated through the
   vertical to achieve the desired airspeed upon rollout for the next maneuver.
        6.9.3.1. Abnormal Procedures. If not within the target airspeed window, adjust pitch
        attitude during climb to achieve desired airspeed. If below minimum apex altitude,
        maintain an inverted climb until reaching minimum apex altitude. If you will be below
        4,000 feet AGL and over 400 knots prior to achieving 90 degrees nose low, execute
        emergency dive recovery procedures. If at anytime during the maneuver it appears that
        the aircraft will not attain the prescribed altitude/airspeed parameter limits, the maneuver
        will be aborted. Reposition the aircraft for follow-on maneuvering.

   6.11.1. Maneuver Description. After takeoff and at a minimum of 4,500 feet AGL with an
   attitude of 30-70 degrees nose high, perform an unloaded 180-degree aileron roll to achieve
   an inverted climbing attitude. Initiate a smooth pull to the horizon to achieve a wings-level
   inverted position at 5,500 feet AGL. Continue the pull in maximum power through the
   vertical, using 2.0-4.0 Gs, to 135 degrees of turn (45 degrees nose low). As the nose drops
   below the horizon and the airfield environment is reacquired, correct as necessary to
   complete the Split-S down the show line. On a standard day, at 90 degrees nose low, airspeed
   should be between 225 to 325 knots and altitude greater than 4,000 feet AGL. At 135
   degrees, relax backpressure and smoothly transition to be in level flight at 300 feet AGL for
   the Flat Pass.
   6.11.2. Abnormal Procedures. If not within the target airspeed window, adjust pitch
   attitude during climb to achieve desired airspeed. If below minimum apex altitude, maintain
   an inverted climb until reaching minimum apex altitude. If you will be below 4,000 feet AGL
   and over 325 knots prior to achieving 90 degrees nose low, execute emergency dive recovery
   procedures. If at anytime during the maneuver it appears that the aircraft will not attain the
   prescribed altitude/ airspeed parameter limits, the maneuver will be aborted. Reposition the
   aircraft for follow-on maneuvering.

   6.13.1. Maneuver Description. At 4,000 feet prior to show center, smoothly pull the nose to
   five degrees up, establish a climb, and relax stick pressure. A cadenced four-point roll to the
   left is then performed by pausing momentarily at the 90-degree, 180-degree, 270-degree, and
   360-degree points. Move the stick briskly, causing a left roll and an immediate stop at each
   point when pressure is released. The pace of the cadence should ensure the aircraft is at the
   180-degree point over show center. At the completion of the pass and at the 360-degree
   point, a repositioning maneuver is performed to orient for a right to left initiation of the High
   G Turn.
   6.13.2. Abnormal Procedures. If starting parameter limits are not achieved, abort
   maneuver and transition to a flat pass. During the maneuver, if the nose is below the horizon
   at the 180-degree inverted point, abort the maneuver by rolling to wings level.

   6.14.1. Maneuver Description. At approximately 3,000 feet prior to show center, select
   full AB and accelerate to approximately 450 knots. At show center, turn away from the
   crowd using approximately 85 degrees of bank. Begin the turn with a smooth G onset rate to
   maintain airspeed at approximately 350 knots and 7.5 Gs. G-loading and airspeed bleed-off
   rate will vary with density altitude. The first 180 degrees of turn should be accomplished
   with a 1 Â¾ degree nose-up attitude and the last 180 degrees of turn should be accomplished
   with a 1 Â¾ degree nose-down attitude to make the turn appear level to the crowd. Vary the
   bank angle and pitch to arrive at level flight at the completion of 360 degrees of turn and to
   ensure the maneuver is finished above the entry altitude. Surface winds must be taken into
   consideration in order to center this maneuver on show center and to avoid overshooting the
   show line. As you approach show center, smoothly but briskly roll out to set up for the
   Cuban 8.
   6.14.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the minimum entry parameters are not met, the pilot will
   transition to a wings-level flat pass. If during any portion of the maneuver it becomes
   apparent the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL or airspeed decay below 300 knots,
   abort the maneuver by rolling wings level and climbing to 500 feet AGL. If necessary, adjust
   power and G as required (no lower than 300 knots) to avoid overshooting the show line.

   6.15.1. Maneuver Description. Following the High-G Turn, reposition the aircraft and
   descend to fly wings level down the 1,500-foot show line at 500 feet AGL and 400 knots.
   Approximately 3,000 feet past show center, begin a brisk but smooth wings-level pull to
   approximately 25-units AOA. Normal apex altitude is above 4,500 feet AGL. At apex
   altitude, reduce power. Airspeed should be 150-250 knots. The pull is held until the nose
   passes through 125-140 degrees of pitch where the backpressure is eased to maintain a
   constant nose track of 25-45 degrees nose low inverted. The 25 to 45-degree nose low
   inverted attitude is held until approximately 3,000 feet AGL and airspeed should be
   approximately 300 knots. At 3,000 feet AGL, advance throttles to MIL and perform an
   unloaded roll to wings level upright. Roll the aircraft as necessary to maintain proper
   alignment along the show line (wind correction). Gradually increase backstick pressure to
   ensure aircraft will not descend below 500 AGL. At no later than 1,200 feet AGL initiate full
   afterburner and begin a brisk but smooth wings-level pull to approximately 25-unit AOA.
   The second half is completed in the opposite direction using the procedures described earlier.
   6.15.2. Abnormal Procedures. If either or both afterburners fail to light abort maneuver by
   decreasing pitch attitude to level flight and investigate malfunction. If apex airspeed is less
   than 175 knots, decrease backstick pressure and accelerate to target airspeed before reducing
   throttles and pulling nose through horizon. If desired pitch attitude is exceeded while
   inverted, roll upright and set desired pitch angle and continue maneuver. If less than 2,500
   feet AGL while inverted, an immediate roll and pull to wings level will be initiated. If at any
   time it becomes apparent that the maneuver will be completed inside the show line (poor
   wind correction, improper alignment) abort the maneuver and setup for the next pass.

   6.16.1. Maneuver Description. After performing a reposition maneuver, align the aircraft
   to fly down the 1500â€™ line. At 6,000â€™ from show center roll and pull to a 20 degree dive
   angle. The dive angle will normally be 10 â€“ 25 degrees nose low depending on winds. The
AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                               175


   optimum dive angle is 20 degrees. Do not exceed 25 degrees. Recovery should be initiated at
   1,000 - 800 feet AGL using a max performance pull in order to bottom out at or above 300
   feet AGL. Be careful not to over-G the aircraft during this pull. In order to make this corner,
   a minimum of 400 knots must be obtained. After recovering to level flight, accomplish a
   reposition maneuver to set up for the LAHD Bomb Pass. Use the 1500-foot show line at
   show center as a reference point, and offset the pyro area at least 150 feet.
   6.16.2. Abnormal Procedure. If entry parameter limits are not met, abort the maneuver and
   perform a wings-level pass. If at any time the dive angle exceeds 25 degrees, either abort the
   pass and fly through straight and level or shift the aim point longer and parallel to the show
   line until the dive angle is 25 degrees or less. Check airspeed at 1,500 feet AGL. If it is not at
   least 375 knots, abort the pass and fly through straight and level.

   6.17.1. Maneuver Description: After performing the Low Angle Strafe Pass, continue
   straight-and-level to approximately 3,000 feet past show center, then begin a 40-50 degree
   turn away from the crowd starting a slight climb to apex around 1,000 feet AGL accelerating
   to approximately 450 knots. At approximately 2.5 miles from show center, make a flat turn
   and pull to a point to begin a run-in at 500 feet AGL and 20-30 degrees off the show line.
   Align the aircraft to fly slightly offset the preplanned bombing target/point, away from the
   crowd. Do not allow a vector towards the crowd! At approximately 1.3 miles from the target,
   pull up to 20-40 degrees nose high. Passing approximately 1,500 feet AGL and approaching
   the run-in on the 500-foot show line, roll-in on the target. The dive angle will normally be 10
   â€“ 25 degrees nose low depending on winds. The optimum dive angle is 20 degrees. Do not
   exceed 25 degrees. Recovery should be initiated at 1,000 feet AGL using a max performance
   pull in order to bottom out at or above 400 feet AGL. Be careful not to over-G the aircraft
   during this pull. In order to make this corner, a minimum of 400 knots must be obtained. Use
   the 500-foot show line at show center as a reference point, and offset the pyro area at least
   150 feet. After recovering to level flight, accomplish a reposition maneuver to set up for the
   SAM Weave.
   6.17.2. Abnormal Procedures. If entry parameter limits are not met, abort the maneuver
   and perform a wings-level pass. If at any time the dive angle exceeds 25 degrees, either abort
   the pass and fly through straight and level or shift the aim point longer and parallel to the
   show line until the dive angle is 25 degrees or less. Check airspeed at 1,500 feet AGL. If it is
   not at least 375 knots, abort the pass and fly through straight and level.

   6.18.1. Maneuver Description: After performing the LAHD Bomb Pass recovery to level
   flight, begin a right 30-70 degree turn away from the crowd ensuring a slight climb away
   from the ground. The bank angle will be approximately 70-90 degrees ensuring you are at or
   above 500 feet AGL at the end of the turn. Rapidly unload the jet and roll left 135 degrees
   and use a max performance pull into the oblique 10-20 degrees nose high. Then rapidly
   unload and roll the jet 180 degrees to the right and perform a maximum pull to 10-20 degrees
   nose low into the oblique. Once reaching 10-20 degrees nose low, rapidly unload, and roll
   upright to pull up into a normal reposition for the Dedication Pass.
   6.18.2. Abnormal Procedures. If entry parameter limits are not met, abort the maneuver
   and perform a normal reposition maneuver. If at any time the dive angle exceeds 25 degrees
   nose low, immediately transition to a level pull to the reposition maneuver. At no time should
   airspeed drop below 300 knots or should the jet be lower than 500 feet AGL. If the airspeed
   drops below 300 knots in the climb, accelerate uphill prior to pull down.

   6.19.1. Maneuver Description. Approach show center wings level, at 500 knots and 300
   feet AGL. At 3,500 feet prior to show center select full afterburner and initiate a 6 to 7.5 G
   wings-level pull to arrive at show center with 90 degrees of pitch. The pull should be made
   so the aircraft is vertical at show center. When the aircraft is vertical, perform high- rate
   unloaded aileron rolls until reaching a minimum of 250 knots or 3,000 feet below waivered
   airspace. Stop the aileron rolls and execute a vertical recovery by smoothly pulling the nose
   to the nearest horizon. Deselect afterburner and modulate power as necessary to setup for the
   spiral descent.
   6.19.2. Abnormal Procedures. If entry parameters are not met at 3,000 feet prior to show
   center, delay until entry parameters are met. If entry parameters are not met prior to 2,000

   6.20.1. Maneuver Description. As the aircraft nose is brought through the horizon,
   reacquire the airshow environment. In idle power, perform a vertical spiraling descent
   oriented toward show center. Initiate dive recovery to recover by 6,000 feet AGL. Do not
   exceed 450 knots in the descent. The direction of the dive recovery should be as necessary to
   reposition for the next maneuver, however do not exit the maneuver over the crowd.
   6.20.2. Abnormal Procedures. If entry airspeed window is not met (too fast) adjust dive
   angle to minimize airspeed in the descent. If below 12,000 AGL at the apex of the climb
   (airspace restrictions, weather conditions), adjust dive angle to safely execute a recovery at
   6,000 AGL. When initiating the spiral descent at altitudes above 15,000 AGL, adjust
   minimum dive recovery altitude accordingly. (If starting at 18,000â€™ AGL, initiate dive
   recovery at 9,000 AGL.) Initiate an immediate dive recovery if airspeed is at/or above 450
   knots. Show center orientation is a secondary consideration in the spiral descent. If at
   anytime during the maneuver it appears that the aircraft will not attain the prescribed
   altitude/airspeed parameters, the maneuver will be aborted. Roll out and/or pull to a wings-
   level position, initiate a descent and reposition the aircraft for follow-on maneuvering.
   OPTION: Due to changing weather conditions, the vertical spiraling descent may not be
   possible after the Max Climb. Start a descent when able to maintain VMC conditions to
   position the aircraft to set-up for the next maneuver.

   6.21.1. Maneuver Description. The intent of this maneuver is to pay tribute to our war
   fighters. It is to be flown prior to the Knife Edge Pass during the High and Flat Show profiles
   and prior to the Tactical Pitch-Up to Landing for the Low Show. The maneuver is flown on
   the 500-foot line and is non-aerobatic. Following the Spiral Descent (high show), LAHD

   Bomb Pass (low show), or Level 8 (flat show) attain a safe airspeed and reposition the
   aircraft to arrive behind and offset the crowd. The approach will be flown from behind the
   line, approximately 2 miles from show center, with an approximate 30 degree dive angle and
   a 45 degree cut (max bank angle 90 degrees) to the show line, remaining 500 feet from the
   crowd at all times. Upon reaching a point 500 feet from the corner of the crowd and 300 feet
   AGL, roll the aircraft into a level arcing pass using a max bank of 90 degrees. Use top rudder
   if necessary to maintain altitude. Select mil power until passing the show line or until a target
   airspeed of .85M is anticipated. Varying pressure altitudes and temperatures will determine
   when to deselect afterburner to ensure the target airspeed is attained at show center and the
   max airspeed is not exceeded. Ensure military power is selected prior to entering the arcing
   pass and through the exit of the maneuver. Do not use afterburner during the arcing pass.
   Optimum profile of the aircraft is achieved at approximately 80 degrees of bank. Use caution
   not to over bank the aircraft and allow the aircraft to lose altitude while banking. In order to
   maintain 500 feet from the crowd at each corner, the flight path at show center will have to
   extend beyond 500 feet. Continue the arc beyond the opposite crowd corner, reduce power as
   required, roll out of bank, and continue a maximum 45 degree climb to set up for the Knife
   Edge Pass.
   6.21.2. Abnormal Procedures. Abort the maneuver if at any time the aircraft comes closer
   than 500â€™ to the crowd line or its lateral limits, an excessive dive angle or sink rate develops,
   entry parameters are not met, or the aircraft descends below 200 feet AGL. Abort the
   maneuver by rolling the aircraft wings level and flying away from the crowd.

   6.22.1. Maneuver Description. Enter the 1,500â€™ show line at 500 feet AGL and 400 knots.
   At 8,000 to 6,000 feet prior to show center, raise the nose three to five degrees, establish a
   climb, and apply stick pressure to roll 90 degrees toward the crowd. The aircraft is held in
   this position until 8,000 to 6,000 feet past show center. Top rudder is applied to help hold the
   nose above the horizon so the full maneuver can be accomplished. Forward stick pressure is
   applied to keep the aircraft on the show line and to maintain level flight.
   6.22.2. Abnormal Procedures. If entry parameters are not met, abort the maneuver, make a
   flat pass, and reposition for the next maneuver. If the nose falls below level flight (zero
   degrees pitch in the HUD) or if the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL, abort the
   maneuver.

   6.23.1. Maneuver Description. At 3,000 feet prior to show center, 500 feet AGL, and 350
   knots select afterburner. Smoothly pull the nose five degrees up, establish a climb, and relax
   stick pressure. Perform an unloaded 405-degree aileron roll followed by an aggressive pull-
   up to downwind. During the pull to downwind, terminate afterburner and slow to below 300
   knots. Configure for and execute a normal final turn and landing.
        6.23.1.1. Option 1: On the pull-up to downwind, an additional 180-degree roll
        (reversal) may be performed to land from the opposite direction. Start at 4,000 feet prior
        to show center.
        6.23.1.2. Option 2: If a Heritage Flight is to be performed immediately following
        completion of the demonstration, conduct a low approach or wings-level pass and
        proceed to rejoin with Heritage Flight aircraft using pre-briefed procedures.
   6.23.2. Abnormal Procedure. If entry parameters are not achieved by show center, pull-up
   to a normal closed pattern.

   6.25.1. Maneuver Description: The takeoff is performed with flaps and in full afterburner.
   At 190 knots, execute a smooth, but brisk aft pull of the stick to achieve takeoff rotation.
   After a positive rate of climb is established, retract the gear and flaps and rotate the nose to
   achieve a 23-25 unit AOA climb (max AOA 30 units). Smoothly roll and pull away from the
   crowd to a wings-level inverted position with afterburners pointing directly at the crowd.
   Hold inverted flight for approximately five seconds, accelerate to 250 to 400 knots, and then
   perform a 270-degree right turn to position for the Flat Pass. Minimum airspeed in the climb
   will be 190 knots; minimum altitude inverted will be 800 feet AGL.
   6.25.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the show profile takeoff is interrupted by an aircraft
   malfunction, make a normal takeoff, or if conditions warrant, abort the takeoff.
   NOTES:
   The Max Performance Takeoff/Inverted may be flown in either direction.
   The Inverted Takeoff may be substituted for the Vertical Climb Takeoff at any time.
   Reasons are not limited to, but may include: takeoff direction due to wind and show
   orientation, weather considerations, terrain, or to demonstrate a different aircraft capability.
   The Inverted Takeoff is described in the low section.
   A normal takeoff may be flown in place of the Max Performance Takeoff (Climb and
   Inverted) if required. Reasons include, but are not limited to: weather (ceiling, visibility,
   winds) and field conditions (rising terrain, high density altitudes, etc.). If flying the normal
   takeoff to accomplish a weather check before starting the actual profile, start the show from a
   staged position.

   6.29.1. Maneuver Description. At 4,000 feet prior to show center with 425 knots and a
   minimum of 500 feet AGL, raise the nose eight degrees, establish a climb, and relax stick
   pressure. Apply full left stick pressure to perform a maximum of three consecutive unloaded
   aileron rolls. As the second roll is completed, it is important to ensure the aircraft has gained
   altitude and the nose is still above the horizon. At the completion of the third roll, roll out and
   reposition for the Level 8.
   6.29.2. Abnormal Procedures. If starting parameters are not achieved, abort maneuver and
   transition to a flat pass. If the nose drops below level inverted on the second roll or roll
   coupling occurs (to exceed approximately 2.5 G) immediately roll wings level and climb to
   minimum altitude.

   6.30.1. Maneuver Description. At approximately 2,500 feet past show center, select full
   afterburner and accelerate to approximately 450 knots. Turn away from the crowd using
   approximately 85 degrees of bank. Begin the turn with a smooth G onset-rate to maintain
   airspeed at approximately 350-400 knots and 5 to 7 Gs. G-loading and airspeed bleed-off rate
   will vary with density altitude. Maintain a minimum of 300 knots. The first 180 degrees of
   turn should be accomplished with a 1Â¾-degree nose-up attitude to make the turn appear level
   to the crowd. After 225 degrees of turn, unload and briskly roll wings level. Approaching the
   show line, reverse direction of turn and accomplish a second level turn in the opposite
   direction. Adjust power to enter the second turn with the same entry parameters as the first.
   Fly the second turn using the same techniques as the first. After 270 degrees and with a 45-
   degree cut to the show line, reverse the turn again. Vary the bank angle and pitch to arrive at
   level flight at the completion of the maneuver and to ensure the maneuver is finished above
   the entry altitude. Surface winds must be taken into careful consideration to center the
   maneuver over show center and to avoid overshooting the show line. Complete the maneuver
   by turning as required to finish on the show line heading the same direction as entry. Perform
   a repositioning maneuver to set-up for the next maneuver.
   6.30.2. Abnormal Procedures. Adjust power and G as required to avoid overshooting the
   show line. If the aircraft descends below 500 feet AGL, reorient lift vector to ensure a timely
   correction. If the aircraft descends below 400 feet AGL or the airspeed decays below 300
   knots, abort the maneuver by rolling wings level, climbing to 500 feet AGL, and
   repositioning for the follow-on maneuver.

Figure 6.22. F-15E Staged Show Sites.




   6.46.1. When demonstration aircraft takeoff from other than the show site, plan to arrive
   over the show site with the fuel requirements prescribed in paragraph 6.2 plus enroute
   return fuel IAW AFI 11-2F-15E, Vol 3. The pilot may enter from behind the crowd at a
   minimum of 1000 ft AGL as depicted in Figure 6.22, or via a Flat Pass maneuver down the
   show line, and complete the show as described in this chapter. Upon completion of the
   Dedication Pass and clearing the crowd, turn out behind the crowd and return to the staging
   airport. Pilots should plan to fly a full demonstration, but may cut the profile short as
   required to maintain suitable enroute return fuel.
6.47. (Added-ACC) Maneuver Description â€“ Pyro. Prior to the start of the demonstration,
the demonstration team safety observer will get a radio check from the SIC. Radio contact will
only be initiated by the safety observer, and in no instance will the SIC talk to the pilot unless
safety of flight becomes an issue. During the Cuban 8, the safety observer will make a â€•next
pass hotâ€– call. This will alert the SIC to the marking shot during the repositioning maneuver and
give the SIC permission to discharge the pyrotechnics as briefed. The pilotâ€™s responsibility is to
fly the demonstration without distraction, and radio calls between the safety observer and the
SIC will be kept to the absolute minimum necessary. Once again, no radio calls will be made to
the pilot during his performance. During the repositioning maneuver following the Cuban 8,
aircraft will roll inverted for a brief period of time, followed by a Â¾ roll and a turn to a base leg.
During the base leg of the turn to the strafing run pass, is the timing cue to fire the marking shot.
Following the repositioning maneuver and marking shot, the next pass is the hot strafe pass and
the following pass is the hot wall of fire pass.
   6.47.1. (Added-ACC) Deconfliction with the aircraft will be based on altitude, timing and
   lateral offsets. For strafe pass, the F-15E will turn away from the target area prior to flying
AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                            195


  over the pyro (similar to real-world strafe). For wall of fire pass or bomb pass, the SIC will
  not fire the pyro until the F-15E has pulled vertical and begun a positive rate of climb and
  begins the pull off-target. For all passes, the F-15E will fly a ground track that is offset at
  least 150 feet from the F-15E pyro effect and over fly the pyro by at least 300 feet AGL.
  IAW AFMAN 91-201, explosives safety standards dictate a minimum of 1250 feet
  separation from Hazard C/D 1.1 explosive detonations to unrelated personnel. Therefore, at
  all Air Force Bases, pyro will be set up a minimum of 1250 feet from the crowd line.
  6.47.2. (Added-ACC) Abnormal Procedures â€“ Pyro. Safety is paramount. If at any time
  safety becomes an issue, anyone on the radio may make a KIO call. Following a KIO call,
  the pilot will discontinue his routine and the pilot, safety observer, and SIC will acknowledge
  the call. If there is ever a question of timing, safety, or sequence, the SIC will not shoot the
  pyro.

                           F-22 DEMONSTRATION MANEUVERS

Section 7Aâ€”General Information

7.1. General. Maneuvers described in this document will be used for training and flown in F-22
aerial demonstrations as the complete aerobatic demonstration profile. Aerobatic maneuvers are
included in this grouping, and as such this profile will be treated as a standard Single Ship
Tactical Demonstration profile. The profile passes are listed in a specific order and described in a
specific orientation to the crowd. Abnormal procedures are written for each maneuver. If the
entry conditions are not met for any maneuver, the pilot will recover to wings-level flight and
transition to the next maneuver. For certain maneuvers, the pilot is required to transmit airspeed
and/or altitude to a safety observer. The ground safety observer will confirm parameters are
good, monitor the demonstration pilotâ€™s flight path, engine performance and visually clear the
demonstration area for traffic. The safety observer will direct an abort when parameter limits are
exceeded. Following each maneuver, and before clearing the show line to reposition for the next
maneuver, the pilot will ensure any descent has been stopped and the aircraft is in a level or
climbing attitude with the flight path marker at or above the horizon.
7.2. Aircraft Configuration and Fuel Requirements. These maneuvers will be flown in a
standard configured aircraft with a full fuel load of 18,000 pounds at engine start. If mission
needs dictate, taking off with less than full fuel is authorized. Under all circumstances, the pilot
must takeoff with enough fuel to execute the profile and divert if necessary. Inert weapons may
be loaded, but if the total weight exceeds 1000 pounds the total fuel at takeoff must be less than
17,000 pounds.
7.3. Airspeed and G Limits. Demonstration pilots will not exceed 0.94 Mach. The maximum
target G for this demonstration is 7.5 Gs. This does not preclude a momentary increase in G for
safety considerations.
7.4. Show line Restrictions. The majority of the F-22 demonstration will be flown on a show
line that is 1,500 foot from the crowd. Occasionally, due to show site limitations, the FAA may
reduce the show line to 1,200 feet. The pilot is authorized to perform on a FAA approved 1,200
foot show line. Non-aerobatic maneuvers may be flown on the 500-foot show line unless
specified in the maneuver description.
7.5. Airspace and Runway Requirements. Required airspace for the F-22 is 7,000 feet AGL
and normally a five-mile radius from show center horizontally. The minimum dimensions of the
aerobatic box are 3,000 feet wide, 6,000 feet long, and 7,000 feet AGL. If the FAA has waived a
show line to closer than 1,500 feet, the aerobatic box may be less than 3,000 feet wide, provided
there is at least 1,500 feet from the show line to the outer edges of the box. Minimum runway
length and width is 7,000 feet x 75 feet. The runway, taxiway, and parking area must be stressed
for a 65,000-pound aircraft with single wheel type landing gear.
7.6. Weather Requirements. Weather PARAMETER LIMITS for the high show profile are a
ceiling of at least 4,500 feet AGL, three miles ground and five miles in-flight visibility with a
discernible horizon. Ceiling required for the flat profile is 1,500 feet. Maneuvers will be planned
to maintain VMC throughout the show sequence.

7.7. High Density Altitude Demonstrations. For high density altitude shows, adjust
PARAMETER LIMITS in accordance with the following:
   7.7.1. Add 500 feet to APEX altitudes for each 2,000 feet of altitude above 3,000 feet MSL
   and 10 knots to airspeeds. For example, if the show site altitude is 5,000 feet MSL, add 500
   feet to the baseline target and 10 knots to the airspeed. If the show site altitude is 7,000 feet
   MSL, add 1,000 feet to the baseline target and 20 knots to the airspeed.

time during the demonstration sequence as required. IAW FAA regulations, 90 degrees of bank
may be exceeded during repositions (if required). Repositioning turns may not include added
aileron rolls or other accenting maneuvers.

  7.9.1. Flat Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn is a
  combination horizontal and shallow vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the
  show line when performing the low profile. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn uses less
  altitude than a normal Wifferdill. It requires a larger cut and tends to be looser and flatter
  than a normal Wifferdill. 270-degree turn reversal may be made while the aircraft is
  climbing. The target G for this maneuver is 6.5 to 7.0 Gs. Each turn may differ slightly so
  that airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the flat Wifferdill.
  The entry "cut" turn for the flat Wifferdill is made to ensure no show line or crowd line
  penetration.
  7.9.2. Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. The Wifferdill turn is a combination horizontal
  and vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the show line. The vertical plane is
  used to maintain necessary proximity to the demonstration area. Each turn may differ slightly
  so that airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the Wifferdill.
  As the aircraft departs the show line, maneuver in the horizontal and vertical plane to
  reposition for the next maneuver. The target G for this maneuver is 6.5 to 7.0 Gs. A 270-
  degree turn reversal is made while still climbing. During the last half of the Wifferdill, while
  descending, the turn is adjusted to establish the proper show line entry. The entry "cut" turn
  for the Wifferdill is made to ensure no show line or crowd line penetration.
  7.9.3. J-Turn Reposition Maneuver. The J-Turn reposition maneuver can be used to
  quickly change directions at each end of the show line while minimizing separation from the
  crowd and further displaying the slow speed maneuverability of the Raptor. From desired
  position with 100 KCAS minimum, aggressively apply aft stick while wings level to climb
  and slow the aircraft while loading the aircraft up with alpha. At 36 degrees AOA or more,
  feed in stick and rudder back in the direction of the runway. Do not maintain high alpha more
  than is required to maneuver the aircraft and do not slow the aircraft to below 75 KCAS if
  below 2,500 feet AGL and greater than 75 degrees nose high. Once the nose slices back to
  the horizon and is pointed towards the crowd line, break the alpha to 36 degrees for the
  recovery and maintain alpha until sink rate is arrested and begin to set up for the next pass.
  Regardless of nose position, recover from high AOA and fly the aircraft out not later than
  2,500 feet AGL.

   7.10.1. Maneuver Description. Select full AB at brake release and check engine conditions
   on the roll. Rotate at tech order speed and begin climb. Confirm gear is retracted and the light
   is extinguished in the gear handle. Accelerate in full AB with a positive climb rate until
   approaching show center. At 250 KCAS begin an aggressive pull (soft to hard stop initially)
   up to 75 degrees nose high. Hold 75 degrees nose high (water mark) and allow airspeed to
   slow, AOA to decrease and altitude to increase. Passing 3,000 feet AGL, smoothly bring the
   nose to 90 degrees nose high and wait for 3,500 feet AGL. At 3,500 feet AGL, execute a full
   aft stick high AOA loop to bring the nose to 90 degrees nose low. Hold 90 degrees nose low
   and accelerate. At 100 KCAS, execute a 405 degree roll to set the lift vector on a 45 degree
   reposition line. If 100 KCAS is not obtained prior to 2,800 feet AGL, do not execute the 405
   degree roll, but rather a 45 degree roll to set the reposition line and wait for recovery
   parameters. At 2000 feet AGL, execute a 36 degree AOA recovery and reposition for the
   next maneuver.
   7.10.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the show profile takeoff is interrupted by an aircraft
   malfunction, make a normal takeoff or if conditions warrant, abort the takeoff. If an
   afterburner does not light or they are producing thrust asymmetrically do not initiate the pull
   up. If an afterburner blows out, or if airspeed is ever <75 KCAS below 2,500â€™ AGL,
   immediately abort the maneuver and recover the aircraft by rolling and smoothly puling to
   the nearest horizon. Should an engine fail, ensure throttles are in MIL and recover the
   aircraft. Do not reselect AB until any yaw rate is arrested. If the aircraft slows to 75 KCAS
   prior to reaching 2500 feet AGL, to not execute the high AOA loop and push the nose down
   to wings level on the horizon. Should the takeoff need to be executed from right to left for
   winds or runway length, execute a 225 degree roll to set the reposition line. Regardless of the
   starting axis, the reposition line need to be set and the recovery initiated by 2,000 feet AGL.

   7.11.1. Maneuver Description. Prior to show center, select full AB and accelerate to 475
   KCAS. At show center, turn away from the crowd using approximately 85 degrees of bank.
   Begin the turn with an aggressive G onset rate to 7.5 Gs to avoid accelerating and begin
   bleeding airspeed. G-loading and airspeed bleed-off rate will vary with density altitude. The
   first 180 degrees of turn should be accomplished with a 1 Â¾ degree nose-up attitude and the
   last 180 degrees of turn should be accomplished with a 1 Â¾ degree nose- down attitude to
   make the turn appear level to the crowd. After the first 180 degrees of turn continue bleed
   airspeed down to 250 KCAS. Vary the bank angle, pitch and pull to arrive at level flight and
   275 KCAS at the completion of 360 degrees of turn. Maximum degrees of flight path marker
   negative pitch allowed in correcting for altitude is 5 degrees. Surface winds must be taken
   into consideration in order to center this maneuver on show center and to avoid overshooting
   the show line. As you approach show center, smoothly roll out and aggressively pull the nose
   to 90 degrees nose high. 90 degrees nose high may be exceeded (up to 110 degrees) as long
   as the airspeed minimum can be maintained. As soon as the aircraft reaches 150 KCAS,
   begin a full forward push to drive the nose back down to level and set up for the J-Turn
   reposition.
   7.11.2. Abnormal Procedures. If the minimum entry parameters are not met, the pilot will
   transition to a wings-level flat pass. If during any portion of the maneuver it becomes
   apparent the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL or airspeed decay below 200 KCAS,
   abort the maneuver by rolling wings level and climbing to 500 feet AGL. If the aircraft is
   accelerating past 475 KCAS and the pilot is already at 9 Gs, reduce power to not less than
   minimum afterburner and bleed energy. If necessary, adjust power and G as required (no
   lower than 200 KCAS) to avoid overshooting the show line. In the pull after the roll-out, if
   airspeed reaches 150 KCAS prior to achieving 90 degrees nose high begin the push forward
   early.

   7.13.1. Maneuver Description. The maneuver is flown on the 500-foot crowd line and is
   non-aerobatic. The approach will be flown from behind the line, approximately 2 miles from
   show center with an approximate dive angle of 30 degrees and a maximum of 45 degree cut
   from the show line (as to not exceed 90 degrees of bank in the turn). Maintain 500 feet
   horizontally from the crowd at all times. Upon reaching a point 500 feet from the corner of
   the crowd at 300â€™ AGL, roll the aircraft into a level arcing pass using a maximum of 90
   degrees of bank. Select full AB until passing the show line or until .92M is anticipated. In
   order to maintain 500 feet separation from the crowd at both corners, the apex of the arc will
   be greater than 500â€™ from show center (the amount depends on the degrees offset from the
   show line at the start of the arc and the amount of G used in the turn). Continue the arc until
   reaching the opposite crowd corner, roll out, reduce power and initiate a climb.
   7.13.2. Abnormal Procedure. Abort the maneuver if at any time if: the aircraft comes
   closer than 500â€™ to the crowd line or its lateral limits, an excessive dive angle or sink rate
   develops, entry parameters are not met, or the aircraft descends below 200 feet AGL. Abort
   procedures are to roll wings level, climb and fly away from the crowd.

   7.14.1. Maneuver Description. Following the Dedication Pass reposition, align on the
   1,500 foot crowd line at 300 feet AGL and 300 KCAS. Approaching show center, select full
   AB, ensure both are lit symmetrically and begin an aggressive (soft to hard stop) pull to 90
   degrees nose high. Continue to climb and decelerate. Once 90 degrees nose high is
   established and the AOA has lowered, execute a 360 degree roll. Arrive at 4,000 feet AGL at
   no less than 75 KCAS. Execute a maximum (hard stop) wings level pull to pull nose around
   to the horizon (high alpha loop). As the nose approaches the horizon, apply full pedal in the
   best direction for winds and maintain full aft stick. Continue the turn for 360 degrees or until
   lined up on the 1,500 foot crowd line and begin an aggressive push forward to break the
   alpha and accelerate. Catch 36 alpha in full AB and arrest the descent rate. Set up for the
   loaded roll. Should winds, weather or other factors dictate, the pedal turn may be executed as
   two 180 degree turns. This must be pre-briefed and should not be executed from an airborne
   "on the fly" assessment. If the 180/180 pedal turn is decided upon, add 1,000 feet to the apex
   pull, making the top altitude 5,000 feet AGL. Two 360 degree rolls will be executed on the
   way up due to the additional altitude.
   7.14.2. Abnormal Procedure. If an afterburner does not light, do not initiate the pull up. If
   an afterburner blows out, or if airspeed is ever <75 KCAS below 2,500â€™ AGL, abort the
   maneuver and recover the aircraft by rolling and smoothly puling to the nearest horizon. If
   airspeed reaches 75 KCAS prior to 4,000 feet AGL, initiate the pull early and assess altitude
   parameters to execute the pedal turns. Should 2,500 feet AGL be reached prior to completing
   the turn, recover early. Should an engine fail, ensure both throttles are in MIL and recover
   the jet. Do not reselect AB until the aircraft is under control and greater than 100 KCAS.

   pull up. Smoothly pull to the nearest horizon, rolling out and recover the aircraft. Should an
   engine fail, ensure throttles are in MIL and recover the aircraft. Do not reselect AB until any
   yaw rate is arrested.

   7.16.1. Maneuver Description. Following recovery from the Power Loop, at 1,400 feet
   AGL (higher if aircraft is recovered earlier) and 36 degrees AOA, apply full lateral stick as
   soon as the flight path marker is above the horizon on the recovery. Maintain 30-36 degrees
   AOA with back stick pressure and complete the roll. When the aircraft reaches wings level to
   the horizon again, decrease angle of attack, accelerate and continue to reposition for the next
   maneuver.
   7.16.2. Abnormal Procedures. If both afterburners do not light, do not exceed 30 degrees
   angle of attack. If the aircraft descends below 1,200 feet AGL, immediately initiate a
   recovery by rolling wings level and puling to the nearest horizon. If the aircraft ever exceeds
   45 degrees nose low, recover.    If airspeed is allowed to decay to less than 100 KCAS,
   terminate the maneuver and recover.

   7.17.1. Maneuver Description. After the Loaded Roll, reposition behind the crowd,
   perpendicular to the show line and directly behind show center. Fly over show center at
   1,000 feet AGL and 250 KCAS. Select MIL power over show center and at the 1,500 foot
   line, execute a hard stop pull in MIL power to 80 degrees nose high. Hold 80 degrees nose
   high and allow the aircraft to slow. Power modulate to arrive at 3,000 feet AGL and 0 KCAS.
   Allow the aircraft to slide backwards while holding 80 degrees nose high and in MIL power.
   At 2,500 feet AGL or 75 KCAS backwards (whichever occurs first), execute a full push
   forward to drive the nose of the aircraft to the horizon. Achieve level flight and command
   full AB at 100 KCAS. Begin a turning reposition for the Slow Speed Pass.
   7.17.2. Abnormal Procedure. If beta in the HUD is observed to be greater than 20 degrees
   and rapidly increasing, initiate a recovery. If the tail slide begins prior to 2,800 feet AGL,
   immediately initiate a recovery.

   7.18.1. Maneuver Description. Following the Tail Slide, begin a turn in the direction to set
   up the Slow Speed Pass into the wind. If wind is negligible or predominantly a crosswind, set
   the pass up for a crowd right to left flow. Maintain 150 KCAS in the reposition turn and fly
   to a point ~3,000â€™ from the start of the crowd line. Hit the line at 90 degrees off pass heading
   at 150 KCAS, 800 feet AGL and in MIL power. Execute a soft stop pull to align the jet on
   the desired heading and catch 36 degrees angle of attack. Do not exceed 40 degrees angle of
   attack. Manipulate power and pitch to maintain 800 feet AGL and 36 degrees angle of attack
   on show line heading. After passing the crowd on the opposite side, select full afterburner
   and climb to 4,000 feet AGL to set up for the Split-S.
   7.18.2. Abnormal Procedures. If 40 degrees angle of attack is exceeded, immediately add
   power and push forward to catch and sustain 36 degrees. If the aircraft descends below 700
   feet AGL terminate the maneuver and recover the aircraft. Do NOT select afterburner at any
   time unless greater than 75 KCAS and less than 36 degrees angle of attack. If the aircraft
   slows below 75 KCAS, add power (up to MIL) and decrease angle of attack. If an engine
   fails, select full afterburner on both engines and immediately break the angle of attack to less
   than 30 degrees and obtain 150 KCAS while arresting any sink rate.

   7.19.1. Maneuver Description. In the climb after the Slow Speed pass, maintain 45-50
   degrees nose high and allow the aircraft to accelerate. Tailor degrees nose high to not only
   accelerate but also gain separation away from the crowd for the follow-on High Speed Pass.
   If the nose is held too nose high there may not be enough room to accelerate after the
   maneuver. At 4,000 feet AGL, crosscheck airspeed. With 150 KCAS (minimum) roll to the
   inverted and execute an energy gaining turn to proceed back towards show center. Do not
   exceed 400 KCAS until the nose is through 90 degrees nose low. Orientation to the crowd
   line needs to be immediately assessed. If the aircraft is not on the extended show line
   immediate corrections must be made. Position the aircraft on the non-aerobatic show line at
   300 feet AGL and approximately .8M for the high speed pass.
   7.19.2. Abnormal Procedures. A parameters call to the safety observer is required prior to
   starting the pull. If airspeed is not 150 KCAS (minimum) at 4,000 feet AGL, push the nose
   forward to level flight and accelerate. At 200 KCAS, execute the Split-S. If an aircraft
   malfunction that will affect the aerodynamic performance of the aircraft asserts prior to
   reaching 90 degrees nose low, discontinue the pull, roll wings level and recover the aircraft.

standard profiles are approved for use by military HF qualified pilots at air shows and open
houses. These profiles will be flown in addition to the three HF Display passes as described in
paragraph 9.8, or in the unlikely event the warbird cancels. In either case, the maximum number
of passes (not to include the HF passes) will not exceed three: *NOTE: For staged entry,
military HF pilots will utilize the High Speed Pass as described in paragraph 9.2.2.2 or an over-
the-crowd pass set 90 degrees off show centerline, not to exceed 0.9 mach.
   9.2.1. (Added-ACC) Military F-4 HF pilots:        Comply with AFI 11-209, ACC
   Supplement, Attachment 10, F-4 Standard Aerial Events Profiles.
   9.2.2. (Added-ACC) Military A-10 and F-16 pilots: Comply with the following profiles:
       9.2.2.1. (Added-ACC) Profile 1. Standard Flyover: clean configuration (gear and flaps
       retracted) at approved overhead airspeeds.
       9.2.2.2. (Added-ACC) Profile 2. High Speed Pass: clean configuration (gear and flaps
       retracted) at no more than 0.9 mach.
       9.2.2.3. (Added-ACC) Profile 3. Arcing Pass: Profile begins with an approach from
       the rear quarter of the viewing audience at no more than 0.9 mach. The approach is
       offset from the runway or show centerline by approximately 30 degrees. Approaching
       show center, execute a turn to the â€•crowd sideâ€– and track outbound at approximately 30
       degrees off runway or show centerline so as to scribe an arc around the crowd.
       9.2.2.4. (Added-ACC) Profile 4. F-16 Landing Configuration and Afterburner (AB)
       Climb-to-Level Profile: Profile begins in the landing configuration with gear and flaps
       extended and a slow speed pass over the runway or showline at no greater than 11 units
       AOA. Approaching show center select maximum power, retract gear and flaps and
       accelerate for the climb. Pull up to establish no more than 45-degrees nose-high,
       maintaining minimum airspeed of 150 KIAS, and climb to a max altitude 6,000 feet AGL
       or the FAA approved altitude for the site (whichever is less). If the ceiling does not
       permit a climb to maximum allowable altitude, modify the level off in order to maintain
       VMC.

9.5. (Added-ACC) Airspace Requirements. Minimum required airspace for the HF
demonstration is 1,500 feet AGL vertically and a five-mile radius from show center horizontally.
Minimum aerobatic box dimensions, if required, are 3,000 feet deep, 4,000 feet long, and 1,500
feet AGL.
9.6. (Added-ACC) Weather Requirements. Weather minimums for HF demonstrations are
1,500-foot ceilings and 3 statute miles visibility with a discernable horizon, maintaining VMC at
all times during the rejoin and demonstration. HF formations that are transiting from point to
point (non-demonstration) must maintain VMC at all times.
9.7. (Added-ACC) Formations. For HF operations, there are three formations that dictate the
position of the wingmen with respect to lead: fingertip/Vic, echelon, and diamond formations.
There are two variations that dictate the distance between the wingmen and lead: close and
route.
   9.7.1. (Added-ACC) Fingertip/Vic Formation. Fingertip may be flown as 2, 3, or 4-ship,
   and is intended as the primary demonstration formation. Fly fingertip on an approximate 30-
   degree line. Minimum wingtip spacing is three feet, and in no case should the wingtips
   overlap. The objective should not be to fly as close as possible, but to fly a safe and
   presentable formation. A â€•Vicâ€– formation is a 3-ship fingertip formation.

 Wingmen: Standard Finger tip

       9.7.1.2. (Added-ACC) Breakout:
 Wingmen: Turn away from lead. Number two use caution for wingmen on the opposite side
 from lead.

Figure 9.1. (Added) Fingertip/Vic Formation.




   9.7.2. (Added-ACC) Echelon Formation. Echelon may be flown as 3 or 4-ship, is a
   variation of fingertip, and is typically used when maneuvering in preparation for the break to
   land. Turns should be made away from wingmen.

Wingmen: Standard Fingertip


       9.7.2.2. (Added-ACC) Breakout:
Wingmen: Turn away from lead. Numbers two and three use caution for wingmen on the
opposite side from lead.

   9.7.3. (Added-ACC) Diamond Formation. May be flown as a 4-ship only. It may be
   flown during HF demonstrations or training. It may be briefly practiced when transiting
   from point to point, but is not otherwise authorized for use when a HF formation is transiting
   from point to point.

Figure 9.3. (Added) Diamond Formation.




   9.7.4. (Added-ACC) Close. Close formation defines the closest the aircraft will fly in
   proximity to each other, and is intended as the primary demonstration formation distance.
   Anytime the aircraft are inside the 2 ship-widths minimum spacing for route, they are
   considered to be in close formation. Minimum wingtip spacing is three feet.
   9.7.5. (Added-ACC) Route. Route formation is an extension of fingertip, provides a
   slightly greater distance between the aircraft, and is intended for use as deemed necessary by
   the flight lead. Excessive maneuvering, turbulence, birds, or point-to-point transiting may
   warrant the use of route formation. Spacing is 2 ship-widths to 500 feet, from line abreast to
   30 degrees aft, and vertically the same as fingertip.
9.8. (Added-ACC) USAFHFP Display Profile. The HF display profile is comprised of three
separate and distinct phases: Rejoin, Display Passes, and Break to Land. A Flyby Pass may be
flown after the aircraft Break to Land if the aircraft requires an additional pass to obtain the
required spacing to land. Additional passes may be flown with the coordination of the air boss.
ACC Demonstration pilots will only fly approved maneuvers during the execution of additional
passes. All pilots must be vigilant during this phase of flight as aircraft speeds can vary
tremendously.
 224                                            AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011


Figure 9.4. (Added-ACC) HF Display Profile.




   9.8.1. (Added-ACC) Hold and Rejoin. The rejoin phase must be accomplished at 1,000
   feet AGL above the highest obstacle within 2,000 feet of the flight path of the formation.
   The rejoin typically occurs behind the crowd. Following the rejoin, align the formation for
   the display passes.
AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                      225


Figure 9.5. (Added-ACC) Hold and Rejoin.




   9.8.2. (Added-ACC) Alternate Hold and Rejoin. If the air show environment does not
   allow a rejoin behind the crowd, an alternate method may be flown. The warbird aircraft
   holds behind the crowd and maneuvers down the show line in front of the ACC fighter near
   the end of the capabilities demonstration. The ACC fighter follows the warbird down the
   show line and accomplishes the rejoin in front of the crowd. The formation is then led
   towards and over the crowd from the show line side (1,000 feet AGL minimum) to set-up for
 226                                             AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011


   the display passes. Another option is for the warbird to accomplish a takeoff in front of the
   ACC fighter near the end of the capabilities demonstration, accomplish the rejoin in front of
   the crowd, and fly towards and over the crowd from the show line side to set-up for the
   display passes. This over-the-crowd pass does not count as a display pass.

Figure 9.6. (Added-ACC) Alternate Hold and Rejoin.




   9.8.3. (Added-ACC) Display Passes. There are three display passes that are normally
   flown as part of the HF demonstration: Arcing Pass, Flat Pass, and Over-the-crowd Pass.
   The standard HF demonstration consists of the three passes and in the order mentioned
   above. However, any deviation to the standard (sequence and number of passes) is
   acceptable given the deviation is fully briefed prior to flight. A deviation may be required
   because of display time available, and ground or in-flight obstructions that dictate where the
   formation may fly. Except for emergencies, no in-flight deviation from briefed is authorized.
   An optional fourth Flyby Pass may be flown after the aircraft break to land, if the aircraft
   need an additional pass to obtain the required spacing to land.
       9.8.3.1. (Added-ACC) Arcing Pass. Align the formation to enter the show line at an
       approximate 45-degree angle. Fly a descending, arcing turn no closer than 500 feet from
       the crowd, to include the â€•cornersâ€– of the crowd line. In order to maintain 500 feet from
       the corners, the flight path must extend beyond 500 feet from the crowd at show center.
AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                           227


      Maintain at or above the minimum altitude, giving consideration to wingmen on the
      inside of the turn. Accelerate during the descent to attain the target airspeed and provide
      extra energy for the reposition. Exit the show line on an approximate 45-degree angle,
      maintaining 500 feet from the crowd, and beginning a climb for the reposition. Maintain
      at or above 200 knots during the reposition.

Figure 9.7. (Added-ACC) Arcing Pass.




      9.8.3.2. (Added-ACC) Flat Pass. Following the reposition, fly a descending turn to
      align the formation to enter the 500-foot show line and fly a straight-and-level flat pass.
      Maintain at or above the minimum altitude and accelerate during the descent to attain the
 228                                              AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011


       target airspeed and provide extra energy for the reposition. Exit the show line in a
       climbing arc to establish the 270-degree arc for the over-the-crowd pass, or to maneuver
       for a reposition, maintaining 500 feet from the crowd. Maintain at or above 200 knots
       during the reposition and climb.

Figure 9.8. (Added-ACC) Flat Pass.




       9.8.3.3. (Added-ACC) Over-the-crowd Pass/Break-to-land. Continue the climbing
       turn to 1,000 feet AGL minimum to arrive behind the crowd. Set the formation wings
       level at least one half mile prior to reaching the primary spectator area. Position the
       formation to fly directly over the crowd at show center with target airspeed. Once past
       the crowd, lead will call for the break IAW paragraph 1.20 (Added).
       9.8.3.4. (Added-ACC) Flyby Pass (Optional). The is an optional fourth pass flown
       after the over-the-crowd pass and break-to-land. This pass is usually flown if the aircraft
       need an additional pass to obtain the required spacing to land. Military HF pilots will fly
AFI11-246V1_ACCSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2011                                                         229


      a straight and level pass. Following the break-to-land, each aircraft may fly one gear-up
      flyby pass, only over a runway, no closer than the 500-foot show line, at 300 feet AGL
      minimum. {For civilian warbirds only: The pass may be accomplished non-aerobatic on
      the 500-foot show line or on the appropriate category line if an aerobatic maneuver is
      performed. The flyby pass will be accomplished at a minimum altitude of 200 feet
      AGL.} Following the flyby pass, each aircraft will obtain the required spacing during the
      closed pull-up, configure, and land. Additional passes may be flown with the
      coordination of the air boss. ACC Demonstration pilots will only fly approved
      maneuvers during the execution of additional passes. All pilots must be vigilant during
      this phase of flight as aircraft speeds can vary tremendously.
