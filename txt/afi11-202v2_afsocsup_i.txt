                UNIT STAN/EVAL FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION

3.1. Scope. For purposes of this instruction, "unit" includes levels of organization under HHQs
required to establish a Stan/Eval function. Most units are composed of an Operations Group
(OG) and flying squadrons/detachments (henceforth in this AFI, "squadron" will be used
synonymously with "detachment"). Where there is no parent OG, squadrons will assume duties
listed for OGs.
3.2. Operations Group. The conduct of the unit level Stan/Eval program is directed by the
OG/CC.
   3.2.1. OG/CC Responsibilities.
       3.2.1.1. Provide manpower to the unit Stan/Eval function to execute the duties directed
       by this AFI.
       3.2.1.2. Designate OG Stan/Eval (OGV) flight examiners (see paragraph 4.2.3).
       3.2.1.3. Provide the means to procure the necessary materials for mission planning, pre-
       flight briefings, and flying supervision.
       3.2.1.4. Provide a suitable Stan/Eval testing area.
       3.2.1.5. Direct supplementary evaluations (see Chapter 9).

   3.2.2. OGV Functions.
       3.2.2.1. At the OGV level, emphasis is on overall unit standardization. Under direction
       of the Chief of OGV, flight examiners will ensure standardization among squadron
       Stan/Eval functions and squadron-assigned flight examiners.
       3.2.2.2. Establish procedures for review and quality control of AF Forms 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Qualification, and (if applicable) AF Forms 8a, Certificate of Aircrew
       Qualification (Multiple Aircraft).
       3.2.2.3. Establish procedures to maintain and review unit Flight Evaluation Folders
       (FEFs). If not maintained by the squadron Stan/Eval function, maintain unit FEFs.
       3.2.2.4. Establish procedures for requisite Aircrew Exams (see Chapter 6).
       3.2.2.4. (AFSOC) Aircrew Examination Program. Conduct stan/eval aircrew testing at
       the group level (N/A for ANG/AFRC), except for geographically separated units.
       Control and monitor the administration of these examinations. Examinees may take
       either the open or closed book portion first.
       3.2.2.5. Establish and maintain a trend program.
       3.2.2.5. (AFSOC) Trend Program. Report trends for each squadron during the SEB.

         3.2.2.5.2. For units with more than one type of MDS and/or crew positions, combine
         discrepancies common to all MDSs/crew positions to determine trends (e.g.,
         instrument procedures).
         3.2.2.5.3. For Formal Training Units (FTUs) and Combat Crew Training Squadrons
         (CCTSs), maintain separate trend data for students and instructors.
         3.2.2.5.4. When trends are noted, recommend corrective action and assign an
         OPR/Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR).
         3.2.2.5.5. Report trends and status to the OG/CC during the SEB until closed (see
         Attachment 2). Maintain an archive of trend data for at least one year from the date
         the trend was identified.

                      AIRCREW QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes aircrew qualification evaluations to
ensure qualification of aircrew members and supplementary evaluations to ensure
standardization of operations.
   5.1.1. To promote efficient use of flying resources, accomplish aircrew qualification
   evaluations concurrently, whenever practical.
   5.1.2. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM supplements.
   For specialized aircrew, see Chapter 8. For guidance on supplementary evaluations, see
   Chapter 9.
5.2. Categories. Aircrew qualification evaluations are divided into five categories
(Qualification (QUAL), Instrument (INSTM), Mission (MSN), Instructor (INSTR), and SPOT)
each consisting of two structured phases, ground and flight. (Exception: SPOT evaluations may
consist of either a ground or flight phase.) Each phase requires the completion of requisite tasks
(see paragraph 5.5). (Exception: a SPOT evaluation has no requisite tasks.)
   5.2.1. QUAL Evaluations.
       5.2.1.1. Purpose. Ensure basic qualification in an MDS and/or crew position.
       5.2.1.2. Execution. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in their
       primary assigned aircraft/crew position as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol
       2. QUAL evaluations may be combined with INSTM and/or MSN evaluations IAW AFI
       11-2MDS, Vol 2. See Chapter 8 for specialized aircrew.
   5.2.2. INSTM Evaluations.
       5.2.2.1. Purpose. Obtain/maintain instrument qualification in order to operate under
       Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
       5.2.2.2. Execution. All USAF pilots (and other pilots flying operationally with the
       USAF, e.g., exchange pilots) will obtain/maintain instrument qualification by
       successfully completing a periodic INSTM evaluation.
           5.2.2.2.1. EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI
           11-401, Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft
           pilots; T-41/51/52 pilots.
           5.2.2.2.2. Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may also be assigned to other
           aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument qualification, but will take their
           INSTM checkride in the non-excepted aircraft.
           5.2.2.2.3. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification will not fly
           under IFR except under supervised status in a training program leading to
           requalification. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed above.)
   5.2.3. MSN Evaluations.

     Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status (IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
     Aircrew Training) will complete a periodic MSN evaluation as specified in the applicable
     AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.1. Exception: The requirement for a MSN evaluation may be waived for
        those aircraft where performance of normal operational, test, and training sorties
        involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM and/or QUAL
        evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 2. Document waiver via memorandum
        for record (MFR) to be included in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2. HQ
        USAF/A3O-A approval is not required for such waivers. Specify approval
        procedures in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction or in the applicable
        AFI 112MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.2. The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required
        in fulfillment of the aircraft’s operational or DOC statement missions.
  5.2.4. INSTR Evaluations.
     5.2.4.1. Purpose. To qualify aircrew as instructors in their weapon system/crew position
     by focusing primarily on the examinees instructional ability.
     5.2.4.2. Execution. Aircrew members obtaining/regaining instructor qualification in a
     weapon system/crew position must complete evaluations of instructional capability in
     that weapon system/crew position. Guidance for specialized, universal, and/or multiple
     qualified aircrew will be specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or AFI 11-2MDS, Vol
     2. Exception For units undergoing aircraft conversion, when a complement of current
     and qualified Air Force instructors does not exist to accomplish initial unit instructor
     qualification, with MAJCOM/A3 approval and Lead MAJCOM/A3 coordination the
     OG/CC may establish an Initial cadre (minimum required for initial conversion) of flight
     instructors who do not require an INIT INSTR evaluation. Initial cadre must be current
     and qualified instructors in a US Air Force aircraft who will remain in the same crew
     position on the new aircraft. OG/CCs will notify MAJCOMs and provide initial cadre
     list for each crew position with current qualification and total flight and instructor hours.
     OG/CCs will use discretion when establishing initial cadre instructors and consider
     availability of suitable instructor courses. See also paragraph 5.13.
     5.2.4.2. (AFSOC) For units gaining a new MDS but not undergoing unit conversion, the
     same exception applies. OG/CCs will designate, with HQ AFSOC/A3 approval, an
     initial cadre of flight instructors and examiners.
        5.2.4.2.1. Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions
        whenever possible. When students are not available or mission/crew composition
        requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator will
        serve as the student.
            5.2.4.2.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Crew members may be certified as BAQ-only
AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013                                                             23


            Instructors in their mission aircraft (i.e., AC/MC/EC-130X) after an “INIT
            INSTR” evaluation, either in the mission MDS or in a basic aircraft series within
            the same MDS (i.e., C-130E/H/J). Document the certification with restrictions on
            the AF Form 4348 IAW paragraph 7.6.3 BAQ-only restrictions may be
            removed in conjunction with a periodic MSN evaluation (explain under Examiner
            Remarks) or with a SPOT evaluation IAW paragraph 5.2.5.4 (Added). A
            second certification board is not required.
        5.2.4.2.2. Evaluations of instructor qualification will be conducted during all
        subsequent periodic evaluations.
            5.2.4.2.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) Periodic MSN evaluations for BAQ-only
            Instructors will include evaluation of instructor qualification in GENERAL
            areas/subareas as listed in the AFI 11-2MDS, Specific Vol 2. The examinee’s
            qualification will be entered as Instructor (e.g., IP, IF, etc.).
        5.2.4.2.3. Instructors who expire on their INSTM, QUAL, and/or MSN checkrides
        evaluations are not qualified to instruct in those areas (e.g., if an IP expires on his/her
        MSN zone, he/she may still instruct in INSTM/QUAL-related areas as specified in
        AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 2).
        5.2.4.2.4. (Added-AFSOC) For aircrew who are multiple aircraft qualified in unlike
        MDS, a separate INSTR (INIT or RQ, as required) evaluation is required per MDS
        (does not apply to initial cadre instructor aircrew or aircrew universally qualified
        (UNIV) via AF Form 8a).
  5.2.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional).
     5.2.5.1. Purpose. Evaluate a specific event or requirement without intending to satisfy
     the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an initial INSTR evaluation.
     5.2.5.2. Execution. A SPOT has no specific requisites, unless specified in MAJCOM
     supplements, but may be No Notice IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.
        5.2.5.2.1. An examinee may utilize a SPOT evaluation to update a
        QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
        evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.8 (document on
        the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.1. OG/CCs may authorize additional flights in order to help the aircrew
            accomplish periodic requirements (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph
            7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.2. When the flight examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not
            qualified in the MDS (e.g., a Senior flight examiner), the evaluation will not be
            credited towards a periodic evaluation.
     5.2.5.3. Any qualifying event and/or evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through
     5.2.4 will be documented as a SPOT evaluation.
     5.2.5.4. (Added-AFSOC) Evaluations conducted solely to remove BAQ-only
     certification restrictions will be documented as SPOT evaluations. The examinee’s
24                                             AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013


     qualification will be entered as Instructor (e.g., IP, IF, etc.) and the purpose of the
     evaluation will be explained under Examiner’s Remarks.
     5.2.5.5. (Added-AFSOC) Inbound PCS/PCA aircrew members with a current AF Form
     8/8a or equivalent document on the same MDS as the gaining unit may maintain the same
     qualification level (Mission Qualification (MQ) or BAQ-only restricted, at the discretion
     of the gaining unit commander), following any applicable AFSOC-specific differences
     training.
         5.2.5.5.1. (Added-AFSOC) The gaining unit commander may elect to use a SPOT
         evaluation to validate AFSOC-specific differences training. For example, AMC C-
         130 IP may be certified as an AFSOC C-130 IP following a satisfactory SPOT
         evaluation.
         5.2.5.5.2. (Added-AFSOC) If the gaining unit commander elects to partially
         downgrade the gained aircrew member (IP to MP, IP to BAQ-only IP), document via
         AF Form 4348 IAW paragraph 7.6.1.3
     5.2.5.6. (Added-AFSOC) A SPOT evaluation may be used for HQ AFSOC evaluations
     of initial cadre aircrew. See paragraph 5.13.4.
  5.2.6. Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe
  the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through 5.2.5:
     5.2.6.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type, to include instructor
     qualification, in a specific weapon system/crew position (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT
     MSN, INIT INSTR).
     5.2.6.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
     qualification due to expiration of a required periodic evaluation, loss of currency
     exceeding six months (as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1), completion
     of a qualification evaluation in a different MDS, a recheck following a failed evaluation,
     or a commander-directed downgrade. A requalification evaluation requires AF Form
     8/8a documentation.
         5.2.6.2.1. Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The recheck will be IAW the
         guidance for that periodic evaluation.
     5.2.6.2.2. Loss of currency that requires a requal evaluation (IAW AFI11-2MDS Vol 1).
     In this case RQ SPOT will be used for documentation (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2). The
     recheck profile will be as directed by the SQ/CC and will include, as a minimum, those
     items for which the individual is non-current and which require an evaluation IAW the
     applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1/2.
         5.2.6.2.3. Completion of a qualification evaluation in a different MDS. The recheck
         will be IAW the guidance for the periodic evaluation in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS,
         Vol 2 and will include, as a minimum, those items for which the individual is
         regaining qualification.
         5.2.6.2.4. A flight recheck following a failed periodic evaluation. The recheck will
         be IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.6.1.
AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013                                                            25


          5.2.6.2.5. Loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
          paragraph 5.9). The recheck profile will be as directed by the commander on the AF
          Form 8/8a (see paragraph 7.4).
             5.2.6.2.5.1. If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to
             complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.5.1), but the
             flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period and
             the OG/CC determines that qualification will be re-established by completion of
             the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight evaluation.
             5.2.6.2.5.2. To prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation.             No
             qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
          5.2.6.2.6. The RQ prefix will not be used under the following circumstances:
             5.2.6.2.6.1. If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to
             complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.5.1), but
             the flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period
             and the OG/CC determines that qualification will be re-established by completion
             of the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight evaluation.
             5.2.6.2.6.2. To prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation.             No
             qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
      5.2.6.3. No-Notice (N/N).
          5.2.6.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
          daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
          5.2.6.3.2. A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the
          evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. “Normal
          preparation” will be as defined in the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
          5.2.6.3.3. (Added-AFSOC) Administer no-notice evaluations at a minimum of 10%
          semiannually by crew position. If assigned manning levels drive excessive no-notice
          evaluations as compared to required recurring evaluations, groups may tailor this
          requirement in their supplement. Exception: 10% rule is without regard to specific
          MDS for aircrew that are qualified on multiple MDS.
      5.2.6.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
      in a simulator and/or suitable ATD as defined in AFI 11-2MDS,Vol 2.
      5.2.6.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
      (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
      evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes (if not obvious by the context of the
      evaluation) will be explained on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.
5.3. Grading System.
   5.3.1. A two step grading system is used to evaluate and document aircrew performance.
      5.3.1.1. In the first step, individual grades are assigned to each evaluation requisite to
      include the grading of areas/subareas of aircrew performance against established
26                                             AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013


     evaluation criteria (see paragraph 5.4). Performance less than fully qualified must be
     documented.
     5.3.1.2. In the second step, an overall qualification level is assigned based on a
     compilation of all individual requisite grades (see paragraph 5.3.3.4).
  5.3.2. Performance Areas/Subareas.
     5.3.2.1. Areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) grading system.
     Discrepancies will be documented against the established areas/subareas.
        5.3.2.1.1. Q indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of
        all required information and performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
        tolerances.
        5.3.2.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
        tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight
        examiner. Deviations must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances, jeopardize flight
        safety, or be a breach of flight discipline.
        5.3.2.1.3. U indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters thereby
        compromising flight safety, that deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances
        adversely affected mission accomplishment, and/or evaluated performance
        constituted a breach of flight discipline. An examinee receiving an area/subarea
        grade of U requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the flight
        examiner.
     5.3.2.2. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or U require remedial action that includes
     either debriefing discrepancies and/or assignment of additional training.
        5.3.2.2.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of
        the evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides instruction concerning the
        discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
        proficiency.
        5.3.2.2.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by the flight examiner
        to remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
            5.3.2.2.2.1. May include self-study, ground instruction, use of a simulator/ATD
            or flying.
            5.3.2.2.2.2. Will be complete by the last day of the third month following the date
            of the discrepancy (e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 12, additional training must
            be accomplished by 30 Apr 12).
            5.3.2.2.2.3. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for completion of
            additional training, the Sq/CC will review the situation and direct appropriate
            action. Document the circumstances with an MFR to be included in the AF Form
            8/8a (see paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
            5.3.2.2.2.3. (AFSOC) If an aircrew member fails to successfully accomplish the
            assigned additional training, the Sq/CC will review the situation and direct
            appropriate action. Document circumstances and any additional assigned training
            with an MFR IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2. If warranted, and additional training
AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013                                                           27


             will not correct the performance deficiency, document under Examiner Remarks,
             Paragraph D, Additional Comments on the original Form 8, and follow with a
             Commander-directed Downgrade IAW Paragraph 5.9.
             5.3.2.2.2.4. Document additional training on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs
             7.3.5.6 and 7.3.7.3.4.
     5.3.2.3. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as “required” in the
     general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 2.
     5.3.2.4. In addition to required areas/subareas, the flight examiner will grade any
     area/subarea observed during an evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts
     the specific evaluation accomplished or overall flight safety.
     5.3.2.5. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions.
     5.3.2.6. Minor momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies
     prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider
     cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
     5.3.2.7. The flight examiner may further identify any area/sub-area as “Commendable”
     if, in the examiner’s determination, the aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional
     skill and knowledge. Document IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.2.
  5.3.3. Qualification Levels. Qualification levels are assigned both to individual
  evaluations (i.e. flight evals and EPEs) as well as overall performance. Individual
  evaluations are graded as a compilation of all area/sub-area grades. Overall performance is
  graded as a compilation of all requisite tasks associated with the required evaluation. Both
  individual and overall grades are based on the following.
     5.3.3.1. Q1. The aircrew member demonstrated desired performance and knowledge of
     procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the grading criteria.
     This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted, but may be awarded when
     discrepancies are noted if:
         5.3.3.1.1. No U grades were awarded for any discrepancy area/sub-area.
         5.3.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
         awarding of an overall Q1.
         5.3.3.1.3. All areas/sub-areas graded as Q- during the evaluation were cleared during
         the debrief of that evaluation.
     5.3.3.2. Q2. The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to perform duties safely, but:
         5.3.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
         assigned.
         5.3.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
         5.3.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q2 may be given if there is
         justification based on Q- performance in one or several areas/subareas.
     5.3.3.3. Q3. The aircrew member demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety,
     performance or knowledge.
 28                                               AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013


          5.3.3.3.1. Any critical area graded U requires an overall Q3 (applicable to both flight
          evaluations and EPEs).
          5.3.3.3.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q3 may be given if there is
          justification based on Q-/U performance in one or several non-critical areas/subareas.
       5.3.3.4. Assigning the overall qualification level.
          5.3.3.4.1. The flight-phase flight examiner is the examiner responsible for assigning
          the overall qualification level.
          5.3.3.4.2. An overall grade of Q1 or Q2 will be given only after all evaluation
          requirements (to include requisite examinations) have been completed and given due
          consideration.
          5.3.3.4.3. An overall grade of Q3 may be awarded at any time.
          5.3.3.4.4. While AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may dictate the highest grade for a flight or
          EPE based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will
          always be the determining factor in deciding the overall grade.
       5.3.3.5. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation. An EQ may be given, but will
       only be applied to the overall grade - not to separate requisites. Document on the AF
       Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.2. An EQ may be given when:
          5.3.3.5.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
          all phases of the evaluation;
          5.3.3.5.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
          5.3.3.5.3. The aircrew member received a Q on all areas/subareas evaluated.
5.4. Evaluation Criteria.
   5.4.1. Lead MAJCOMs, in coordination with the applicable user MAJCOMs, will establish
   and maintain standardized INSTM, MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluation criteria in the
   appropriate AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 2. Lead MAJCOMs will coordinate with the program
   managers of any command-mandated software on any updates of eval criteria to aid in the
   expeditious revision of eval criteria files. Lead MAJCOMs are also responsible for
   coordinating the establishment of the following:
       5.4.1.1. Areas/subareas including the identification of critical areas and those areas
       required for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged into general
       and specific evaluation areas.
          5.4.1.1.1. Critical areas are those areas that, upon failure, would most adversely
          affect the qualification of an aircrew member. Critical areas will include, but are not
          limited to, Airmanship, Safety, and Flight Discipline.
       5.4.1.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Checks. This is required for QUAL
       evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
          5.4.1.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for maintaining required flight
          publications as outlined in applicable AFI11-2MDS volumes.
AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013                                                           29


           5.4.1.2.2. Q performance requires individual flight publications be current and
           properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
           members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
           required for the mission.
       5.4.1.3. An area containing criteria for Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM)
       IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, and
       MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
       5.4.1.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
       and procedures or applicable Host Nation requirements for evaluations administered
       outside of the NAS.
5.5. Requisites. These include both ground and flight phase items. The ground phase, when
required, includes a series of examinations (see Chapter 6) as well as evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment (i.e., EPEs, see
paragraph 5.5.1.2). The flight phase includes an in-flight and/or simulator evaluation of aircrew
performance.
5.5. (Added-AFSOC)Ground requisites for INIT and RQ evaluations are considered
prerequisites and must be completed within 6 months prior to the flight phase.
   5.5.1. Ground Phase Requisites.
       5.5.1.1. Ground phase requisites for each evaluation include the following.
           5.5.1.1.1. QUAL: Open book examination, closed book examination,
           Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
           5.5.1.1.2. INSTM: Instrument examination
           5.5.1.1.3. MSN: As specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
       5.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPEs).
           5.5.1.2.1. Purpose. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs
           and systems for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate mission-specific EPs and tactical
           systems knowledge during MSN evaluations.
           5.5.1.2.2. Execution. AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 will specify contents of EPEs, areas to be
           evaluated, grading criteria, and whether EPEs may be done in-flight, in a
           simulator/ATD, or verbally.
              5.5.1.2.2.1. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for each combined
              evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation).
              5.5.1.2.2.2. A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g., a MSN and
              INSTM/QUAL eval) as long as the combined EPE is of a scope and duration to
              cover required areas and is conducted within the requisite zone for each
              evaluation (see paragraph 5.8).
           5.5.1.2.3. Grading. Q1 performance for EPEs requires taking the proper action in
           the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is responsible
           for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
 30                                                AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013


          5.5.1.2.4. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight
          examiner will indicate if the additional training must be accomplished before the next
          unsupervised flight (see also paragraph 5.3.2.2.2). Document IAW paragraphs
          7.3.5.6 and 7.3.7.3.4.
          5.5.1.2.5. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP
          situation during an EPE requires an EPE grade of 3 (unqualified).m Under these
          circumstances, the examinee will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
          accomplished (either written, verbally, or in a simulator/ATD as determined by the
          flight examiner)
          5.5.1.2.6. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an EPE grade of 3
          (unqualified) will be placed on supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7.
   5.5.2. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
   in the weapon system and/or a suitable simulator/ATD (unless restricted by AFI 11-2MDS,
   Vol 2).
       5.5.2.1. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
       appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 2, and allow accurate
       measure of the proficiency of the examinee.
       5.5.2.2. Evaluation profiles will be realistic, reflect unit tasking, be consistent with daily
       training missions, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the unit mission.
   5.5.3. Requisite Completion.
       5.5.3.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the eligibility period of the
       current evaluation (see paragraph 5.8). The OG/CC may waive this requirement on a
       case-by-case basis (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
       5.5.3.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations accomplished outside
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period
       beginning with the month in which the first ground requisite or flight evaluation was
       administered, whichever occurs first. EXCEPTION: For extended evaluations (IAW
       paragraph 5.8.3.2), requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
       eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
       5.5.3.3. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of combined
       evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 2.
       5.5.3.4. Requisites from a completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations
       provided they cover all required areas and are within the requisite zone for each
       evaluation.
       5.5.3.5. For aircrew possessing instrument qualifications in multiple aircraft, one
       instrument exam may count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs
       within the zone for each evaluation IAW the paragraphs above.
5.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013                                                          31


  5.6.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or ground
  recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first failure,
  (e.g., for an evaluation on 20 Jun 12, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 12).
     5.6.1.1. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the three-month time limit on a case-by-case
     basis.
         5.6.1.1.1. Document the waiver(s) with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8/8a
         IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
     5.6.1.2. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed during this
     period, based on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and hours of
     training required.
     5.6.1.3. The flight examiner that administered the original check will not normally
     administer the recheck.
     5.6.1.4. A recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q or
     Q-/debriefed criteria for each area graded U.
     5.6.1.5. Ground rechecks may be directed when the flight examiner deems a flight
     recheck unnecessary, but are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of a Q3
     evaluation (document IAW paragraph 7.3.9.2).
     5.6.1.6. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.5.3.1 or
     5.5.3.2 remain valid, IAW the paragraphs above.
  5.6.2. Status Downgrade. Aircrew members receiving a Q3 INSTM, QUAL and/or MSN
  evaluation are non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR)/non-basic
  mission capable(N-BMC)/non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
  For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC) need not be downgraded if
  the discrepancies were only in instructor areas/subareas.
  5.6.3. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
  judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
  successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
     5.6.3.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
     requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
         5.6.3.1.1. QUAL Evaluation: Place the examinee on supervised status (see
         paragraph 5.7) in the aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in
         the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For
         specialized, universal, and/or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining qualification for
         similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 2 may direct supervised status in
         all aircraft in which the individual maintains qualification.
         5.6.3.1.2. INSTM Evaluation: Restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
         examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
         5.6.3.1.3. MSN       Evaluation:     The      examinee       may    perform     basic
         qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
         supervised status for mission tasks.

          5.6.3.1.4. INSTR Evaluation (or any evaluation where instructor qualifications are
          being evaluated): Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any instructor
          area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is completed.
      5.6.3.2. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q3 on any evaluation until a successful recheck is
      completed (see paragraph 5.6.1).
      5.6.3.3. If defined in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1 and/or Vol 2, formal schoolhouses will include
      restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a for any core item not accomplished due to training
      limitations, regardless if the method of qualification is by evaluation or instructor
      certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform core items in which they are
      not qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. In this case, MDS-
      specific guidance will set the time requirement for completion of additional training.
      5.6.3.3. (AFSOC) For aircrew that receive a restricted AF Form 8/8a for an event not
      accomplished during formal school house training in an area that is not part of the
      gaining units Mission Essential Task List (METL), the restriction will be removed on the
      next evaluation. Under comments on the next AF Form 8/8a state “the restriction for
      XXX is removed due to METL incompatibility”.
      5.6.3.4. Document restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.1.
5.7. Supervised Status.
   5.7.1. If unsatisfactory performance or restrictions require an examinee be placed on
   supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be
   determined by the SQ/CC and/or as specified in AFI11-2MDS, Vol 1.
   5.7.2. Supervision will only be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors.
5.8. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
   5.8.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th
   month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g., a periodic
   evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 10 expires on 31 Mar 12.).
   5.8.2. Eligibility Period. Periodic evaluations will be scheduled in the eligibility period,
   defined as the six-month period prior to the expiration date.
   5.8.3. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. On a case-by-case basis, periodic evaluations may be
   scheduled before or after the eligibility period according to the following criteria:
      5.8.3.1. Evaluations Conducted Prior to the Eligibility Period. SQ/CCs may
      authorize individuals to complete periodic evaluations prior to the eligibility period
      (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
      5.8.3.2. Extended Evaluations.
          5.8.3.2.1. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize blanket
          or group extensions on an as-required basis. Requests for extensions at MAJCOM or
          subordinate levels will be submitted IAW paragraph 1.3.2.
          5.8.3.2.2. MAJCOM-Extended Evaluations.          MAJCOM/A3s may extend
          evaluation expiration dates for aircrew members for up to six months. Provide
          notification to AF/A3O when extensions are approved (copy to AF/A3O-AI).
AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013                                                              33


         Provide guidance for MAJCOM extensions in MAJCOM supplements to this
         instruction.
         5.8.3.2.3. SQ/CC-Extended Evaluations. SQ/CCs may extend the expiration date
         of periodic evaluations up to three months for the reasons listed below (document
         IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2). Extensions will be on a case-by-case basis and this
         paragraph is not authority to grant blanket extensions. For individual extensions
         longer than three months, see paragraph 5.8.3.2.2. For group or blanket extensions,
         see paragraph 5.8.3.2.1. Requisites not completed during the original eligibility
         period must be completed prior to the extended expiration date.
             5.8.3.2.3.1. PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
             5.8.3.2.3.2. Departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft type.
             5.8.3.2.3.3. Undergoing unit aircraft conversion, as directed by MAJCOM.
             5.8.3.2.3.4. Removal from active flying status (e.g., separation or retirement).
             5.8.3.2.3.5. Participation in real world operations (to include operations other
             than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required flight evaluation(s)
             before or during deployment.
     5.8.3.3. Non-Standard Approval Authority.
         5.8.3.3.1. For SQ/CCs and above (e.g., OG/CCs, WG/CCs, etc.), the approval
         authority is the next commander in the examinee’s flying chain of command.
         5.8.3.3.2. In all other cases, if the flying chain of command differs from
         administrative chain of command (e.g., HHQ attached flyers), approvals will be by
         the attached unit/CC with the concurrence of the examinee’s immediate
         administrative supervisor.
         5.8.3.3.3. For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval
         authority.
  5.8.4. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
  member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
  eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.2) or within the
  period for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.3), the aircrew
  member loses the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph
  5.6.3 apply.
     5.8.4.1. Qualification may be re-established by accomplishing a complete requalification
     evaluation (to include requisites) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation.
     5.8.4.2. OG/CCs may waive the re-accomplishment of completed requisites on a case-
     by-case basis (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
  5.8.5. FTU students, initial qual and requal aircrew members will complete all requisites and
  flight evaluation within a six month period. The OG/CC may waive this requirement on a
  case-by-case basis, document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2, and report this in
  the SEB minutes.
 34                                               AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013


5.9. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander (squadron or above) may direct a
downgrade (Q-/U) in a specific area/sub-area without unqualifying an individual. Additionally, a
commander may direct a downgrade that either removes a qualification (e.g., IP to MP) or
completely unqualifies an individual (e.g., MP to UP). Downgrades may be directed without
administering an evaluation using the following guidance:
   5.9.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only (e.g., breach of flying discipline, flight
   safety, etc.). Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an examiner, but may be
   recommended by an examiner from any MDS/aircrew specialty.
   5.9.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
   administrative or judicial actions (e.g., Letter of Counseling, Article 15, etc.). (Consult with
   the supporting SJA office for legal advice in these cases.) Use in cases where such incidences
   directly affect the commander’s confidence in the aircrew member’s ability to safely operate
   the aircraft and/or equipment (e.g., lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the
   aircrew’s decision-making abilities in the aircraft).
   5.9.3. For downgrades that either remove qualifications or completely unqualify an
   individual, the affected aircrew will cease acting in the qualification(s) from which they have
   been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade.
   5.9.4. Commander Directed Downgrades will be documented IAW paragraph 7.4.
5.10. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members who
maintain qualification in two or more MDS aircraft. For Universal Qualification see
paragraph 5.11.
   5.10.1. When differences between aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead
   MAJCOM, in coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate
   qualification requirements.
   5.10.2. When separate qualifications are not required, document certification in different
   MDS series using AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. In lieu of the AF Form
   4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized
   official.
   5.10.3. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
   including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   See AFI 11 202, Vol 1.
   5.10.3. (AFSOC) HQ AFSOC/A3V retains approval authority for multiple qualifications
   unless otherwise stated (HQ AFRC/A3 for AFRC aircrews; HQ NGB/A3 for National Guard
   Bureau (NGB) aircrews). For multiple qualifications other than those listed in paragraph
   5.10.7 (Added), HQ AFSOC/A3V will maintain the authorized list of aircrew multiple
   qualifications and publish this list online. Units may request to add or delete names from the
   authorized list via appropriate stan/eval channels, either by hard copy MFR or an AFSOC-
   approved Common Access Card (CAC)-enabled digitally signed electronic request. Include
   the following information on requests: Name, grade, social security number (SSN), unit of
   assignment/attachment, current duty title, Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), multiple
   qualification aircraft MDS, rationale, and flying time summary. AFRC units send requests
   through channels to HQ AFRC/A3V; ANG units send requests through channels to HQ
AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013                                                            35


  NGB/A3. Multiple qualification must be approved by HQ AFSOC/A3V (HQ AFRC/A3/HQ
  NGB/A3 as applicable) prior to receiving any training on any additional aircraft.
  5.10.4. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
  include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified by
  the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are directed by
  the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
  5.10.5. QUAL and MSN Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL evaluation, and, if
  applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each MDS aircraft they maintain
  qualification according to applicable AFI MDS Vol 2, or AFI 10-3502 Vol 2.
  5.10.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q3 on an INSTM evaluation results in a
  downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A downgrade
  resulting from a Q3 in a QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft for which the
  evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is
  applicable to additional aircraft.
  5.10.7. (Added-AFSOC) The following crew positions are authorized multiple
  qualifications in the aircraft listed in each subparagraph below. Multiple qualifications in the
  aircraft listed in each subparagraph do not require written HQ AFSOC/A3V approval or an
  annual request and justification. See AFI 11-2 MDS Specific, Vol 1, for qualification
  requirements. Crew members listed below will adhere to evaluation criteria set forth in their
  AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Vol 2, IAW paragraph 7.6, document certifications using AF
  Form 4348.
     5.10.7.1. (Added-AFSOC) Pilots.

           5.10.7.5.1. (Added-AFSOC) AC-130H, C-130E/H.
           5.10.7.5.2. (Added-AFSOC) MC-130E/H/P, C-130E/H (to “slick” only, not
           between MC variants).
   5.10.8. (Added-AFSOC) For multiple qualification in the AC-130H/U/W and/or MC-
   130E/H/P, and/or C-130 E/H accomplish conversion/differences and continuation training
   IAW AFI 11-2, MDS-Specific, Vol 1. BAQ certifications in different series of similar MDS
   are authorized IAW AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1. Document all conversion/differences training on
   AF Form 4348 for all aircraft which do not require separate flight evaluations.
   5.10.9. (Added-AFSOC) Multiple qualified MC-130 loadmasters (i.e., MC-130E, MC-
   130H, MC-130P, C-130E/H) may complete periodic evaluation requirements in any MC-
   130E/H/P in which they maintain qualification. Loadmasters multiple qualified in different
   MDS aircraft (i.e., MC-130, EC-130, C-212) must complete periodic evaluation requirements
   for each MDS.
5.11. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized aircrew
who maintain qualification in two or more MDS where qualification is attained/maintained via a
minimum of a ground phase examination. A flight phase evaluation, when required, may be
accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either gaining or maintaining
qualification.
   5.11.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualifications IAW
   Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified crewmember
   eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
   5.11.1. (AFSOC) Direct Support Operators (DSOs), Tactical Systems Operators (TSO),
   Pararescue Jumpers (PJs), and Combat Rescue Officers (CROs) are eligible for Universal
   Qualification in two or more MDS.
   5.11.2. Documentation. See Chapter 7 or Chapter 8, as applicable.
   5.11.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications maintained
   under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A MSN
   evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 2 and/or MAJCOM supplement
   to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will include a flight phase evaluation in
   one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member maintains qualification.
   5.11.3. (AFSOC) DSO/TSO. A periodic QUAL/MSN evaluation is required in one of the
   MDS in which the DSO/TSO maintains qualification. This periodic QUAL/MSN evaluation
   suffices as qualification for all MDS the DSO/TSO maintains qualification. See Figure 5.1
   and 5.2 below and Figure A4.1 in Attachment 4 for an example AF Form 8a.

       5.11.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) DSOs/TSOs may accomplish differences training to obtain
       additional certification on any AFSOC aircraft using AF Form 4348 as required.
       Commander, Air Force Special Operations Forces (COMAFSOF) may authorize TSOs to
       fly on other theater-assigned aircraft as mission requirements dictate. Additional
       certification is required for MC130, C-130, AC-130, rotary/tilt-rotor, and special mission
       aircraft. Differences training is an instructor certified event. Instructors will adhere
       strictly to the syllabus for ground and in-flight training.
       5.11.3.2. (Added-AFSOC) Groups will consolidate periodic closed and open book
       examinations into one test for universal qualified aircrew members using MDS-specific
       MQFs. Consolidated examinations will contain questions unique to each MDS in which
       universal qualification is held and have sufficient questions to cover unique equipment,
       procedures, and information.
       5.11.3.3. (Added-AFSOC) DSO/TSO Instructor upgrades. Flight evaluations for
       DSO/TSO initial instructor upgrade will be conducted on any MDS the DSO/TSO
       maintains qualification and documented on AF Form 8a. DSOs/TSOs will automatically
       be instructor qualified on all aircraft the DSO/TSO maintains qualification.
       5.11.3.4. (Added-AFSOC) DSO/TSO Flight Examiner Certification. After examiner
       certification on a particular MDS, DSOs/TSOs will automatically be certified as a flight
       examiner on all aircraft the DSO/TSO maintains instructor qualification.
   5.11.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally qualified
   aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in loss of
   applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI MDS Vol 2.
   5.11.4. (AFSOC) For DSOs/TSOs, failure to pass a ground requisite or flight phase for a
   periodic MSN evaluation, results in loss of qualification in all aircraft. For N/N or SPOT
   evaluations, the examiner will document under the restrictions section of the AF Form 8a, the
   aircraft for which loss of qualification will apply.
       5.11.4.1. (Added-AFSOC) For DSO/TSOs, the requalification evaluation may be
       performed on any platform on which the DSO/TSO previously held a qualification.
       Upon completion of the requalification evaluation all previously held qualifications may
       be regained based on squadron/detachment commander or designated representative.
       Individual must regain currency in all previously held aircraft qualifications.
5.12. Aircrew Flying in Non-USAF Aircraft and with Non-USAF Units. Aircrew members
authorized to perform duties in non-USAF aircraft IAW AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached
to non-USAF units for flying, abide by host service or host country guidance, except for the
requirement to maintain a current physical and review their flight records according to
AFI 11202, Vol 1 and AFI 11-401.
   5.12.1. Aircrew flying with non-USAF units (i.e., Exchange) do not need to abide by USAF
   guidance, including this AFI and AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 2. Therefore, when they return to
   USAF units, they must complete applicable requisites and be evaluated for any periodic
   USAF evaluations that expired during their tour. The restrictions in paragraph 5.6.3 of this
   instruction apply to such individuals until successful evaluations are completed.
 40                                             AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013


   5.12.2. MAJCOM/A3s may approve exceptions to requirements for returning Exchange
   aircrew members to complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if they
   determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 2
   evaluations (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
   5.12.3. USAF units that use non-USAF aircraft to execute a USAF flying program will
   comply with current USAF guidance, unless when excepted by proper authority. See AFI
   11-401 for definitions of USAF and US Government aircraft.
5.13. Initial Cadre.
   5.13.1. Aircrew members who are appointed by their MAJCOMs as initial cadre either for a
   new mission set requiring a MSN qualification or for a new MDS where no flight examiner
   currently exists will comply with the intent of this instruction.
   5.13.2. See paragraph 7.5 for guidance on Form 8/8a documentation.
   5.13.2. (AFSOC) Aircrew appointed as initial cadre will have the initial AF Form 8/8a
   completed within six months of the date on the initial cadre MFR IAW paragraph 7.5
   5.13.3. MAJCOMs will indicate through MFR which aircrew are appointed as initial cadre
   and include in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   5.13.3. (AFSOC) OG/CCs will designate a small group of instructors and flight examiners
   as the initial cadre. OG/CCs will submit to HQ AFSOC/A3 for approval a MFR containing
   name, rank, current qualification level, aircraft, designated new qualification level, total
   primary aircraft flight hours, total instructor, and evaluator hours (if applicable). HQ
   AFSOC/A3V will maintain the most current approved initial cadre letter.
   5.13.4. Tailor recurring evaluations to program requirements and aircraft capabilities.
   Simulators may be used to satisfy recurring evaluation requirements.
       5.13.4.1. (Added) At the discretion of HQ AFSOC/A3, for units gaining a new MDS,
       but not undergoing full unit conversion, a SPOT evaluation from HQ AFSOC/A3V may
       be used to validate operational procedures and conclude the initial cadre status on the
       new MDS. This SPOT evaluation does not preclude any other evaluation requirements
       that may exist for a particular initial cadre process. This SPOT evaluation should not be
       given until all new applicable guidance memoranda, operating instructions, checklists, or
       supplemental addenda have been approved by HQ AFSOC/A3. The requirement to
       conclude status with a HQ AFSOC/A3V SPOT evaluation will be indicated on the initial
       cadre memorandum.
          5.13.4.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) When electing to use this process, one crew member
          (who has been designated as an evaluator on the new MDS) from each position will
          be evaluated by a HQ AFSOC/A3V evaluator (any MDS). Those crew members,
          following squadron certification, will then conduct the INIT QUAL/MSN evaluations
          for the rest of the individuals on the initial cadre letter.
          5.13.4.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) The scope of the SPOT evaluation is determined by
          the HQ AFSOC/A3V evaluator, but should be comprehensive enough to validate any
          new or nonstandard operating procedures. Document the scope of the evaluation in
          the Examiner’s Remarks and include the comment: “SPOT EVALUATION TO
          CONCLUDE INITIAL CADRE STATUS”.
AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013                                                        41


          5.13.4.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) All ground prerequisites must be completed prior to
          the flight phase of the SPOT evaluation.
      5.13.4.2. (Added-AFSOC) If HQ AFSOC/A3 determines there is no requirement to
      conduct a HQ AFSOC/A3V SPOT evaluation, or for units undergoing full unit
      conversion, the initial cadre members designated as evaluators will conduct the initial
      evaluations for all crew members. This will be done after all new applicable guidance
      memoranda, operating instructions, checklists, or supplemental addenda have been
      approved by HQ AFSOC/A3 and the members have been certified by the squadron.
      5.13.4.3. (Added-AFSOC) Regardless of a SPOT evaluation requirement, any initial
      cadre crew member who fails to complete at least an evaluation by the end of the date on
      the MFR will lose the new MDS qualification and must complete a RQ evaluation in
      order to regain aircraft qualification.
   5.13.5. Pilots in these programs will maintain an instrument qualification (see paragraph
   5.2.2). Maintenance of the instrument qualification, if not practical due to the developing
   capabilities of the new mission set and/or MDS, will be accomplished in aircraft possessing
   similar flying qualities/instrumentation as stipulated in the MAJCOM supplement/AFI 11-
   MDS, Vol 2/MOU.
5.14. Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA). When RPA aircrew members are not qualified in
certain areas (e.g., launch and recovery), provide comment and document restrictions in the
remarks section of the AF Form 8. See paragraph 7.3.7.1.

                         AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written or computer-
based examinations.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) pilots,
navigators, combat systems operators, and air battle managers), CEA, non-rated X-prefix AE
aircrew and RPA sensor operators. For Flight Surgeons (rated), Combat Camera, and non-rated
aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code) that only require an examination to
establish qualification, see Chapter 8. The examination program in this chapter includes
requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and unit periodic examinations. Requisite
examinations include qualification open book and closed book examinations, instrument
examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in paragraph 5.5.1.1.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will document the unit-level aircrew examination
   program.
   6.3.1. (AFSOC) Units will administer requisite exams in a quiet, distraction free testing
   environment.
   6.3.2. Computer-Based Examinations. MAJCOM directed Stan/Eval software may fulfill
   the requirement for exams as outlined in this instruction.
   6.3.2. (AFSOC) Units will use PEX as the standard for aircrew testing. Paper testing may
   be used when computer maintenance problems arise. If the paper option is used, enter data
   into PEX as soon as practical.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. Retain graded exam answer sheets/computer
   records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
6.4. Exam Sources.
   6.4.1. Open Book Exams. Open book questions will come from publications containing
   information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and performance of the assigned
   mission.
       6.4.1.1. The open book subject areas and the publications used to generate the exam will
       be made available to aircrew during testing. Electronic publications may be used as
       references for open book examinations.
       6.4.1.2. Each unit will develop an open book Secure Question Bank (SQB) that serves as
       the source for the open book exam. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
       safeguard it in the same manner as any other required Stan/Eval exam.
       6.4.1.2. (AFSOC) Open book SQBs will consist of enough questions to generate two
       separate tests.
   6.4.2. Closed Book Exams. Questions will come from MQFs.
AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013                                                           43


       6.4.2.1. MDS/crew position-specific MQFs. Lead MAJCOMs will ensure MDS/crew-
       specific MQFs are available for using MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable
       aircrew.
       6.4.2.1. (AFSOC) MQFs are maintained by HQ AFSOC/A3V.
          6.4.2.1.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures,
          administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational
          procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
          6.4.2.1.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate MAJCOM.
          Lead MAJCOMs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes to MQFs as
          necessary.
       6.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local procedures
       MQF to augment MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   6.4.3. Instrument Exams. Reference AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program.
   Units will ensure that only those questions relevant to the weapons system(s) and instrument
   procedures within their unit are included in the available questions from which aircrew will
   test.
   6.4.4. Exam Question Review. The MAJCOM, NAF, and OG Stan/Eval functions will
   review all MDS/crew position-specific MQFs, SQBs, and prepared exams (if used) annually
   and after any changes in source documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a
   source document change it may be annotated as the annual review. Units will document
   procedures for the exam reviews in their supplement to this instruction.
6.5. End-of-Course Exams. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses listed in the
Air Force Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) database
(https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) exams to fulfill the requirements
of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite exams.
   6.5.1. The Stan/Eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate with
   the MDS lead MAJCOM to ensure the EOC exam meets the requirements of this instruction
   and AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 2 before awarding credit for requisite completion.
   6.5.2. EOC exam questions do not need to incorporate MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures and
   not conflict with any MQFs.
   6.5.3. All EOC exams that fulfill the requirements of requisite exams will be graded
   according to paragraph 6.8 and entered on the AF Form 8/8a according to paragraph 7.3.5.1.
   6.5.3. (AFSOC) Credit formal school EOC examinations toward requisite written
   examination requirements provided they are administered as part of a formal syllabus and a
   passing score of 85 percent is attained.
       6.5.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) Contract/vendor EOC exams may be credited as written
       exams (open and/or closed) on a case-by-case basis. Units must submit the requested
       courseware and exams to HQ AFSOC/A3V for approval prior to use. Approval will be
       documented by MFR and maintained while valid by HQ AFSOC/A3V. Units will advise
       HQ AFSOC/A3V when the courseware and/or exams are updated or no longer required.
 44                                               AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013


6.6. Exam Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs exams, units will either
maintain prepared exams for each crew position or generate a unique exam for each aircrew
member.
   6.6.1. If prepared exams are maintained for each crew position:
       6.6.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two exams for each
       crew position.
       6.6.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one exam.
       6.6.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information, units are
       not required to maintain separate exams for each crew position.
       6.6.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on each prepared exam each
       calendar year.
   6.6.2. If a unique exam is generated for each aircrew member:
       6.6.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for exam creation.
       6.6.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain at least twice the number of questions
       required for each exam (e.g., if a 50-question exam is generated, there must be at least
       100 questions in the exam database).
       6.6.2.2. (AFSOC) Examinations will consist of a minimum of 40 questions. Combined
       QUAL/MSN examinations will consist of a minimum of 40 questions with equal
       emphasis on qualification and mission areas.
   6.6.3. When published guidance changes, the associated prepared exam or exam database
   (depending on method used) will be updated as soon as possible upon receipt.
6.7. Exam Security. Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all requisite exams,
applicable answer sheets, and associated computer-based media.
6.8. Grading.
   6.8.1. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs exams on the two-tier grading system (i.e.,
   Q/U). Satisfactory performance requires writing the proper actions in the correct sequence,
   not necessarily a verbatim response. The minimum passing grade is 100 percent.
   6.8.2. Written or Computer-Based Examinations. Grade written or computer based
   examinations as a percentage of correct answers. The minimum passing grade is 85 percent.
   All questions missed will be reviewed immediately following the exam.
   6.8.3. Units will grade all requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew
   member’s next flight.
6.9. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam.
   6.9.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination must be
   afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other than Boldface/CAPs, the
   aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
   6.9.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite exam must complete
   a successful reexam by the end of the third month following the date of the first failure, or
   the end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first. Waiver authority to extend the time
AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013                                                         45


   allowed to successfully complete the reexam is the OG/CC (document IAW paragraph
   7.8.3.2.2).
   6.9.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction.      Aircrew members failing a
   Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful Boldface/CAPs
   reexam is accomplished.
   6.9.4. Supervised Status.
       6.9.4.1. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite open/closed book or instrument
       exam in supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7 until successful retesting is completed.
       6.9.4.2. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status
       resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination applies only to the
       aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of the instrument exam
       results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all aircraft in which
       instrument qualification is required.
6.10. Unit Periodic Examinations (Optional). If used, MAJCOMs and/or units will include
guidance in their supplements to include procedures for failed exams.
6.10. (AFSOC)Unit Periodic Examinations. All aircrew members will successfully complete
a Boldface written examination prior to the first flight of each month (if applicable to crew
position). A Boldface written examination will be accomplished for each MDS in which the
aircrew member is qualified/certified. Aircrew members failing this Boldface examination will
not fly as aircrew members until a successful reexamination is accomplished.
   6.10.1. Each group/squadron Stan/Eval function may conduct periodic testing for all aircrew.
   The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional knowledge beyond the scope of requisite
   exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or
   operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit.
   6.10.2. Administration of the exam is at the discretion of the MAJCOM and/or unit.
   6.10.3. Periodic exams will not count as a requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy
   the requirement for a periodic exam.

                                            Chapter 7

                                      DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications for which an aircrew member is to be evaluated are
determined from the unit certification document. This chapter provides documentation guidance
for members that require an in-flight evaluation to establish qualification. See Chapter 8 for
documentation guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-rated aircrew that
only require an examination to establish qualification.
   7.1.1. The results of aircrew evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 8/8a. The
   chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF Form 942,
   Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF.
   7.1.2. In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is authorized, to include use
   of electronic signatures and wholly electronic FEFs IAW MAJCOM supplement guidance.
   In all instances, computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms as published on the USAF
   EPublishing web site.
7.2. Qualifications versus Certifications. Qualifications are attained through evaluations and
documented on the AF Form 8/8a, as applicable. Certifications are attained through methods
other than evaluation (e.g., commander certifications, flight lead upgrades, etc.) and may be
documented on an AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications or on a unit certification
document signed by an authorized official.
7.3. AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. The AF Form 8/8a is the source document used to record and verify the
   qualification of an aircrew member.
       7.3.1.1. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification in a single aircraft.
       7.3.1.2. Use of the AF Form 8a is optional for aircrew maintaining qualification in
       multiple aircraft and/or multiple series qualification in the same MDS or are Universal
       Qualified.
       7.3.1.3. Completion of an AF Form 8/8a is accomplished by four individuals: the flight
       examiner, a Reviewing Officer, a Final Approving Officer, and the examinee.
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8, Attachment 4 for
   sample AF Forms 8a.
       7.3.2.1. In all instances of data entry, if an electronic form is used, the format required by
       the electronic form will be used (see also paragraph 7.1.2).
       7.3.2.2. For date fields use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit year format
       (e.g., 24 Jun 12).
       7.3.2.3. The “Eligibility Period” and “Expiration Date of Qualification” blocks will use a
       three-letter month and two-digit year format (Jun 12).
       7.3.2.4. Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e., annotating the type evaluation,
       “INSTR”), use upper and lower case letters.
AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013                                                            47


     7.3.2.5. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
     data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
     desired.
  7.3.3. Date Completed.
     7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date of the evaluation requisites (ground or flight
     phase) or the additional training if assigned.
     7.3.3.2. (Form 8a) Use the latest completion date of all MDS listed.
  7.3.4. - Examinee Identification.

         7.3.4.4.3. For periodic evaluations where the evaluation expiration date of the
         previous evaluation is extended under the provisions of paragraph 5.8.3.2.3, enter
         the 6-month period preceding the original expiration date (SQ/CCs extend only the
         expiration date, not the eligibility period).
         7.3.4.4.4. Dual entries are authorized for misaligned combined evaluations (e.g., if
         last INSTM evaluation expires Nov 12 and QUAL evaluation expires Jan 13, enter
         “INSTM: Jun-Nov 12/QUAL: Aug 12-Jan 13” for an INSTM/QUAL evaluation).

            7.3.5.2.2.1. IAW paragraph 5.2, use the following designations to describe the
            purpose of the evaluation(s): INSTM, QUAL, MSN, INSTR, or SPOT. If
            combined, include the designation of each evaluation (e.g., QUAL/MSN,
            INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.).
               7.3.5.2.2.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Do not log mission and special mission
               evaluations on the same line in the flight phase block of the AF Form 8/8a.
               Special mission events requiring evaluation will be annotated individually as
               “SPOT” evaluations in the flight phase block of the AF Form 8/8a. Further
               define the specific evaluation in the mission description section under
               “Examiner’s Remarks”.
            7.3.5.2.2.2. Use the following prefixes, when applicable, to describe the type of
            evaluation: INIT, RQ, N/N and/or SIM. More than one prefix may be used to
            describe an evaluation as outlined in paragraph 5.2.6.
               7.3.5.2.2.2.1. The only annotations of INSTR used are INIT INSTR and RQ
               INSTR as described in paragraph 5.2.4.
               7.3.5.2.2.2.2. INSTR will not be used for periodic evaluations as the AF Form
               8/8a aircraft/crew position is already annotated with the instructor designation
               (e.g., IB, IN, IP)
               7.3.5.2.2.2.3. When requalification deals with regaining a complete loss of
               instructor qualification, document it as RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
            7.3.5.2.2.3. Make a single line entry to document the flight(s)/event(s) used to
            complete the evaluation.
            7.3.5.2.2.4. Make multiple single line entries for each flight/event if two or more
            flights/events are required and administered by either different flight examiners or
            on separate days.
            7.3.5.2.2.5. Where a single mission (such as airlift tasking) consists of multiple
            flights over one or more days with the same flight examiners, a single line entry
50                                             AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013


            may be used.

            7.3.5.2.3.1. Enter the date the flight/event was completed.
            7.3.5.2.3.2. For evaluations where a single mission consists of multiple flights
            over one or more days (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2.5), enter the inclusive dates of
            the flight(s). Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
            7.3.5.2.3.3. For evaluations conducted on missions consisting of a single flight
            spanning more than one day, use a single line entry with the date the mission was
            completed. Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
     7.3.5.3. Qualification Level.
        7.3.5.3.1. Annotate the examinee’s overall qualification level IAW the definitions of
        paragraph 5.3.3 by placing a “1” (for Q1) or “2” (for Q2) in the qualified block or a
        “3” (for Q3) in the unqualified block.
        7.3.5.3.2. Combined evaluations (e.g., INSTM/QUAL, INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.)
        require only one grade if all evaluations were awarded the same overall level.
            7.3.5.3.2.1. If the overall level varies for each type of evaluation accomplished,
            indicate the qualification level for each part separately (e.g., “INSTM: 1” and
            “QUAL: 2” in the qualified block or “INSTM/MSN: 1” in the qualified block and
            “QUAL: 3” in the unqualified block).
        7.3.5.3.3. (Form 8a) Place a 1, 2, or 3 in the Qual Level block next to the applicable
        flight phase.
        7.3.5.3.4. (Form 8a) This section does not apply to Universal Qualified aircrew
        members or to crewmembers that do not require a flight phase evaluation (see
        Chapter 8).
     7.3.5.4. Expiration Date of Qualification.
        7.3.5.4.1. IAW paragraph 5.8.1. for evaluations that establish a new eligibility
        period, enter the month and year that is 17 months after the month in which the flight
        phase of the evaluation was successfully completed.
        7.3.5.4.2. For evaluations that do not establish a new eligibility period, enter “N/A.”
        7.3.5.4.3. Combined evaluations require only one date if all parts of the evaluation
        were successfully completed and/or “N/A” if all parts were assigned an unqualified
        grade.
            7.3.5.4.3.1. For combined evaluations where one component is successfully
            completed and/or one component is assigned an unqualified grade, indicate by
            assigning a new expiration date for those portions completed successfully, and
            “N/A” for those portions awarded an unqualified grade (e.g., QUAL 1 and
            INSTM 3, then enter “QUAL-Jul 12” under Qualified and “INSTM-N/A” under
            Unqualified).

52                                             AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013


           7.3.6.1.2.2. Will always place an “X” in the remarks block and make comments
           in the comments block.
               7.3.6.1.2.2.1. (Form 8a) This applies only when a flight phase is required; if
               only a ground phase is required, do not place an "X" in the remarks block and
               no Examiner Remarks are required in the Comments block in Section IV.
           7.3.6.1.2.3. (Added-AFSOC) Both electronic and wet ink signatures are
           acceptable on the AF Form 8/8a.
        7.3.6.1.3. If two or more flights are required to complete an evaluation, only the
        flight examiner completing the evaluation will sign Section III, any other evaluator(s)
        will enter remarks in the Mission Description block describing those parts of the
        flight evaluation they evaluated and sign a signature block immediately adjacent to

        7.3.6.2.1. (Form 8a). A Reviewing Officer is not required for non-rated aircrew with
        only ground phase examination requisites for qualification.
        7.3.6.2.2. The Reviewing and Final Approving Officers (those officers holding these
        positions, or acting in their stead during the period of the signature process -- not
        necessarily the date of the evaluation) will review the content of the AF Form 8/8a
        and the flight examiner’s overall assessment, ensure all required additional training is
        adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete, and will place an “X” in
        the “Concur” block.
           7.3.6.2.2.1. If either or both officers do not agree with any portion of the Form
           8/8a, the overall grade will not be changed, but the dissenting officer will place an
           “X” in the “Do Not Concur” block on his/her line of the AF Form 8/8a. Remarks
           will not be modified without the concurrence of the individual who entered the
           original comments.
           7.3.6.2.2.2. If “Do Not Concur” is marked, the non-concurring officer(s) will
           provide justification (e.g., reason for non-concurrence, suggested modifications to
           additional training as recommended by the flight examiner, etc.) IAW paragraph
           7.3.7.4 and/or paragraph 7.3.7.5.
        7.3.6.2.3. The Reviewing Officer will sign and date the AF Form 8/8a after the flight
        examiner, but prior to the Final Approval Officer.
        7.3.6.2.4. The Final Approval Officer will sign and date the AF Form 8/8a after the
        Reviewing Officer but prior to the examinee. As applicable, the Final Approving
        Officer may recommend or give a commander-directed downgrade IAW paragraph
        5.9 if further action is warranted.
        7.3.6.2.5. MAJCOMs will specify in the MAJCOM supplement who the reviewing
        and final approving officers will be for evaluations other than formal course
        evaluations accomplished at an FTU. The same individual will not sign as both the
        Reviewing and Final Approving Officer.

7.6. AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications (Optional). See Attachment 7 for sample
AF Forms 4348.
7.6. (AFSOC)AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. AF Form 4348 is considered a
historical source document. Stan/Eval offices will no longer keep AF Form 1381s and will
transcribe or decertify all aircrew certifications to an AF Form 4348.
   7.6.1. Purpose. The AF Form 4348 provides a record of aircrew certification that may be
   kept in the FEF.
      7.6.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 4348 in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1
      documenting certifications by assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew
      members with aircraft certifications in multiple MDS aircraft which do not require
      qualification in each aircraft (e.g., F16C and F-16CM), only one AF Form 4348 is
      required; specify the primary mission MDS designation.
      7.6.1.1. (AFSOC) DSOs/TSOs qualified in more than one MDS aircraft, annotate
      "UNIV" in the ACFT block. For DSOs/TSOs qualified in one aircraft, specify the MDS
      designation.
      7.6.1.2. Unit Stan/Eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
      aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
      certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
      7.6.1.3. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review previous AF Form 4348
      entries to determine all applicable certifications of new assigned/attached aircrew
      member. Then, document applicable aircrew certifications accepted by the gaining flying
      unit commander on a new AF Form 4348.
62                                               AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013


     7.6.1.3. (AFSOC) Retain old copies of AF Form 4348 in Section I of the FEF. Keep the
     newest AF Form 4348 on the top. Never delete any entries on the AF Form 4348, just
     decertify the aircrew member. If member regains certification, then add that back to the
     AF Form 4348.
     7.6.1.4. The OGV/squadron Stan/Eval Chief or other individual designated by the
     SQ/CC will sign a one line entry below all other entries verifying that above certification
     transcriptions are accurate.
     7.6.1.4. (AFSOC) When carrying over certifications for transcription, ensure previous
     AF Form 4348 decertification’s are also carried over to maintain historical reference to
     the member’s certifications/qualifications.
     7.6.1.5. Do not use AF Form 4348 to document one-time training/new equipment unless
     directed by MAJCOM.
     7.6.1.6. Appropriate guidance that may require aircrew certification using AF Form 4348
     entry include MAJCOM and/or supplement; AFI11-2MDS, Vol 1; AFI11-2MDS, Vol 3.
     7.6.1.6. (AFSOC) AF Form 4348s will include all aircrew certifications to include
     instructor certified events, ETCA formal course syllabi resulting in aircraft
     certification/qualification, and any aircrew training not documented by an AF Form 8/8a
     and items as directed in Attachment 9, paragraph A9.1 (Added) Aircrew Certification
     Board. Groups will supplement this paragraph to address unique training requirements of
     owned/gained aircraft and crews.
  7.6.2. General Data Entry.
     7.6.2.1. Complete individual identification block with last name, first name, middle
     initial, any titles (e.g., Jr. or II), last four of SSN, unit MDS and unit (assigned/attached
     for flying) organization/location.

AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013                                                            63


     7.6.3.4. For certifications attained as part of a FTU, the date will match the date of the
     applicable AF Form 8/8a, or enter the date of completion or graduation from FTU if no
     AF Form 8/8a is issued.
     7.6.3.5. Certification Official/Organization. MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF
     Form 4348 certifying officials. The Certifying Official will sign above their typed name,
     rank, organization and office symbol.
     7.6.3.5. (AFSOC) OG/CC, Chief of OGV, Sq/CC, Chief of Squadron Stan/Eval, or
     representatives designated by the OG/CC or Sq/CC are AF Form 4348
     certifying/decertifying officials. Document delegation authority in the unit supplement.
     7.6.3.6. The Certifying Official is the person authorized by governing directives to
     approve or certify an aircrew member for a specific position or event.
     7.6.3.7. If a certification is given with restrictions, state the restrictions on the AF Form
     4348 in the Remarks block.
  7.6.4. Decertification. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for
  Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
     7.6.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
         7.6.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
         but also applies to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
         substandard performance).
         7.6.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, place an “X” in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7 for example.
     7.6.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
     performance.
         7.6.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
         occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI11-2, Vol 1, when instructor certified events
         become core mission events, or when a higher certification is obtained making the
         previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also applicable for
         decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than substandard
         performance.
             7.6.4.2.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Flight Examiners, instructors, and aircraft
             commanders may be decertified for discretionary purposes (PCS/PCA or due to
             overages in the applicable crew position) within the unit without the individual
             losing the qualification. Aircrew review board or an aircrew certification board is
             not required in these instances. For commander-directed decertification, use the
             decertification section on the AF Form 4348, annotating appropriate comments to
             clarify the intended qualification of the aircrew member.                Instructor
             decertification does not require ARMS crew position status downgrade if the
             overall qualification level is left unchanged. Individuals who have been
             decertified as instructors for discretionary purposes must demonstrate instructor
             abilities on recurring evaluations IAW paragraph 5.2.4.2.2 in order to maintain

        instructor qualification.
     7.6.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification, place an “X” in the appropriate
     box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
     organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
     Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7.                Note: For
     decertification due to loss of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the
     effective date of decertification will be the date of certification loss.
     7.6.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
     Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: annotate “Renamed (new
     title)” under Remarks.
     7.6.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
     Stan/Eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 4348 indicating the new MDS and
     transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.6.1.3.
     7.6.4.2.4. (AFSOC) AFSOC crew members transferring between AFSOC MDS
     aircraft that have the same certified events do not require decertification/certification
     board action.       Previous certification(s) will be valid upon completion of
     mission/conversion training. Add a new AF Form 4348 with crew member’s new
     MDS.

     FEF.
  7.8.5. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
  and how to implement the periodic review of FEFs.
     7.8.5.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
     aircrew members to verify their qualification(s) (and certifications on AF Form 4348 if
     used) prior to their first flight.
        7.8.5.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the qualification
        of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable documentation in
        Sections I and II of the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.2. Following the initial review, the unit maintaining the FEF is responsible
        only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.3. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
        Stan/Eval function at the unit/squadron to which they are attached to fly, the
        Stan/Eval function of that unit/squadron will also review the FEF prior to their first
        flight.
     7.8.5.2. Posting Review.
        7.8.5.2.1. The Stan/Eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a and AF Forms
        4348 (if used) when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and completeness.
        7.8.5.2.2. The Form 8/8a review will confirm that the eligibility period and
        qualification as documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events and
        requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that all signatures and
        initials are obtained within the allotted time (see paragraph 7.3.8.5).
        7.8.5.2.3. The AF Form 4348 (if used) will be reviewed for correct certification
        signature and to ensure all previous entries are accurate and accounted for.
        7.8.5.2.4. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM supplement.
     7.8.5.3. Periodic Review.
        7.8.5.3.1. The Stan/Eval function will review all applicable FEFs to confirm
        expiration dates used to track required aircrew qualification evaluations are the same
        as those listed in the FEFs. Periodic review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is
        not required.
        7.8.5.3.2. The interval between reviews will not exceed the standard qualification
        period window unless a more restrictive review period is established by the
        MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.3. Document the periodic review IAW MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.3. (AFSOC) Periodic FEF reviews and evaluation dates are required. (N/A
        ANG/AFRC) Conduct during the individual's birth month. Publish in local
        procedures. If applicable, return all removed documents to the crew member.
AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013                                                          71


  7.8.6. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8/8a, AF
  Forms 4348 (if used), AF Form 942, and any MAJCOM-directed documentation.
     7.8.6.1. Major Discrepancies.      Discrepancies that affect the qualification of the
     affected aircrew member.
        7.8.6.1.1. Major discrepancies are documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section
        I or II immediately above the affected AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348 (if used), or in
        chronological order for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348
        (if used).
        7.8.6.1.2. MFRs documenting similar major discrepancies found on multiple AF
        Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.
     7.8.6.2. Minor Discrepancies. Discrepancies that do not affect the qualification (and/or
     certifications if using the AF Form 4348) of the affected aircrew member (e.g., typos,
     formatting and misspellings).
        7.8.6.2.1. Minor discrepancies are documented on a non-permanent record as defined
        by the MAJCOM or unit supplement to this instruction and need not reside in the
        FEF.
     7.8.6.3. Corrections.
        7.8.6.3.1. AF Form 8/8a. As a source document, the AF Form 8/8a may be
        corrected by use of white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document
        provided the flight examiner signing Section III of the form initials the correction. If
        the original FE is not available then document the discrepancy IAW paragraphs
        7.8.6.1 or 7.8.6.2. When the original FE is not available, OGV Chiefs may also
        correct minor discrepancies as prescribed in MAJCOM supplements.
        7.8.6.3.1. (AFSOC) Chiefs of OGV may make corrections to minor discrepancies
        on AF Form 8/8a. Initial as near the change as possible to maintain legibility.
        7.8.6.3.2. AF Form 942. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may be
        altered without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected aircrew member
        and the contents of the FEF.
        7.8.6.3.3. AF Form 4348 (if used). AF Forms 4348 may be corrected by use of
        white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document provided the certifying
        official signing that line of the AF Form 4348 initials the correction. For significant
        corrections that alter the certification’s intent, make a new AF Form 4348 entry.
        7.8.6.3.4. Electronic Corrections. If the system used to store the record does not
        allow corrections to be made, then document the discrepancy IAW paragraph 7.8.6.1
        and/or paragraph 7.8.6.2.
  7.8.7. Transfer of FEF.
     7.8.7.1. Retention of Records. Retain all records in the FEF until reviewed by the
     gaining unit. After review, return to the individual those forms not retained in the FEF.

     7.8.7.2. Formal Training Graduates. For Formal Training School graduates reporting
     directly to an overseas command for a short tour, retain formal training school records for
     transfer to the subsequent gaining unit.
     7.8.7.3. PCS of Individual. Aircrew members will normally hand-carry their FEF along
     with their FRF to the gaining organization.
         7.8.7.3.1. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization will mail the
         folder to the gaining unit via registered mail.
         7.8.7.3.2. Mail any records not included in the FEF to the gaining organization with
         clear identification of the individual concerned.
         7.8.7.3.3. When mailing an FEF or any of its contents, retain a copy (hard or soft
         copy is acceptable) until the gaining organization has received the original FEF.
  7.8.8. Disposition of FEF.
     7.8.8.1. Dispose of the aircrew FEF according to the Air Force Records Disposition
     Schedule (RDS) and Air Force guidance concerning the protection of Personally
     Identifiable Information.

                                SPECIALIZED AIRCREW

8.1. Purpose. This chapter provides additional guidance pertaining to flight surgeons and non-
rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification.
   8.1.1. Initial and periodic qualification consists of a written (open or closed book)
   examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion of the examination,
   members will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal qualification).
   8.1.2. MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and/or MDS-Specific
   qualification requirements.
       8.1.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) Specialized Aircrew will develop MDS-specific qualification
       and examination requirements in coordination with the applicable OGV.
   8.1.3. Qualification requirements will be documented on an AF Form 1522, ARMS
   Additional Training Accomplishment Report, and stored in ARMS in the Formal Training
   module with currency tracked in the Training module. No AF Form 8/8a or FEF is required;
   however, the Stan/Eval function of the unit to which specialized aircrew are

       ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS (FCIF, SII, GO/NO-GO, SUPPLEMENTARY
                          EVALUATIONS)

9.1. FCIF.
   9.1.1. Units will establish and maintain a library consisting of a current read file and
   publications. This library will consist of the items listed in Table 9.1 in either hardcopy or
   electronic format. If a unit establishes a paper library, it will be organized into volumes as
   shown in the table.
   9.1.2. FCIFs may be issued to alert crewmembers to publications changes for TOs or AFIs
   that affect aircraft operations, but actual publication changes must be accomplished IAW
   established procedural guidance, to include AFI 33-360 (as applicable) and TO 00-5-1.
      9.1.2.1. MAJCOMs will advise user commands when releasing an FCIF item that affects
      a weapon system. FCIF items that affect weapon systems will include designated
      MAJCOM applicability.
      9.1.2.2. FCIF items that contain weapon system data will be controlled IAW the
      applicable distribution statement in the governing Technical Order (TO).
   9.1.3. Required Volumes. Volume I is a table of contents for all volumes and current read
   file items, Volumes II through IV are made up of publications and flight manuals, and
   Volume V (optional) is reserved for flight safety information. If units choose hardcopy
   format and the contents of any volume exceed the capacity of its binder, use an additional
   binder and identify the first and subsequent binders by a letter of sequence (e.g., IIIA, IIIB).
   Label binders on the spine indicating Volume and Title as follows:

Table 9.1. Required Volumes.

VOLUME                        TITLE

VOLUME I                      Table of Contents/Current Read File

VOLUME IV                     Flight Manuals/Checklists/Aircrew Aids/Technical Orders

VOLUME V (Optional)           Flight Safety Information
   9.1.3. (AFSOC) Volume V, when used, is exempt from the controls applicable to Volumes
   I through IV. Units will specify Volume V review and certification procedures/requirements
   in unit supplement. Items for this volume will be submitted to unit/squadron safety officer
   IAW AFPAM 91-211, USAF Guide to Aviation Safety Investigation.
AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013                                                          75


     9.1.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) Required Joint, Special Operations Command, Department of
     Defense, or North Atlantic Treaty Organization publications will be included in Volume
     II.
  9.1.4. Current Read File. Volume I consists of a minimum of two parts to include an Index
  (Part A) and Current Read Files (Parts B and C (Note: Part C is optional)). MAJCOMs may
  add additional components to Volume I as appropriate.
  9.1.4. (AFSOC) If units use automated programs to provide positive verification of FCIF
  Part B items, they will document procedures in unit supplements.
     9.1.4.1. Part A is a table of contents listing all material contained in FCIF Volumes I
     through V.
     9.1.4.1. (AFSOC) Part A - FCIF Index. Prepare the index using the information on the
     HQ AFSOC publications website. Use the format established on this file or Part A and
     Part B formats as prepared from MAJCOM approved stan/eval software. At a minimum,
     the wing/group stan/eval office completes the FCIF index in January for each subordinate
     unit. Type the preparation date in the upper right hand corner of the index. Units which
     have to reaccomplish the FCIF index will type the date the index was accomplished in the
     upper right hand corner of the index.
     9.1.4.2. Part B is the Current Read File of FCIF messages. Messages contain
     information temporary in nature, directly pertinent to the safe conduct of flight, and must
     be read before flight. FCIFs that contain aircraft-related information will be forwarded to
     all using MAJCOMs.
     9.1.4.2. (AFSOC) Part B - AFSOC Form 12, Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). The
     AFSOC Form 12 contains only temporary material. New or revised material is included
     in Volumes II, III, and IV. Use the "CREW POSITION" column to identify those crew
     positions responsible for review of information on the form. The wing/group stan/eval
     office normally prepares the AFSOC Form 12 when located on the same base with
     subordinate units. For non-collocated units, the unit aircrew stan/eval office may assume
     responsibility for preparation. The removal date (review date for units maintaining an
     active Part B via stan/eval software) is established by the office responsible for
     preparation and will not exceed 6 months. The preparing office enters the index number
     and date/time group on the AFSOC Form 12 when posting the item to the FCIF. The
     preparing office monitors non-collocated unit input to ensure unrelated information is
     excluded from the AFSOC Form 12. Prior coordination is required for collocated unit
     input. Exception: Units may use Part A and Part B formats as prepared from
     MAJCOM-approved stan/eval software.
         9.1.4.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) Flight Crew Information Summary (FCIS). The OG
         or detachment chief of stan/eval publishes an FCIS semiannually beginning January 1
         of each year. Exception: AFRC and ANG wings and groups gained by HQ AFSOC
         or under HQ AFSOC oversight are not required but encouraged to publish FCISs.
         Host active duty FCISs may be applicable to their Reserve squadrons and vice versa,
         as specified in Unit Supplement. FCISs contain vital information not otherwise
         available to crews. Individual FCIS items should have a reference/point of contact,
         retention statement and will remain effective for the duration of the current FCIS,
76                                             AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013


        unless rescinded sooner. Consolidate FCIF items semiannually into subsequent
        FCISs. The FCIS format is located on the HQ AFSOC/A3V online site. Upon
        publication, forward one copy of the FCIS to HQ AFSOC/A3V, HQ AFRC/A3V, and
        HQ 10 AF/A3 (A3V) for AFRC units.
            9.1.4.2.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) AFRC only. When units do not publish FCIS,
            ensure individuals accomplish an initial review and certification of all volumes
            prior to first flight. Assigned and attached aircrew will accomplish a complete
            review of all volumes and recertify prior to flight whenever absent from flying for
            90 days or more. Compliance with these additional reviews will be specified in
            unit supplement and tracked via unit Go/No-go program.
            9.1.4.2.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) AF Form 4121 (PEX may be used), FCIF
            Currency Record, documents aircrew member review of applicable AFSOC Form
            12s, as well as the current FCIS. The unit aircrew stan/eval office will prepare an
            AF Form 4121 for each assigned and attached aircrew member. Begin a new
            form each year on 1 January. When a second card is needed, staple it to the
            original. Update the AF Form 4121 if new material has been added since the last
            review. All aircrew members enter the index number for the last item and date
            and initial the AF Form 4121, regardless of the CREW POSITION annotated on
            the AFSOC Form 12.
     9.1.4.3. Part C is the Current Read File that contains information temporary in nature but
     not related to the safe conduct of flight and not required to be read before flight.
     9.1.4.4. Squadrons with both primary crewmembers and mission crewmembers may use
     separate sections in Volume I for mission crewmembers. In addition, these squadrons are
     exempt from the requirement to maintain mission crewmember checklist and aircrew aids
     in the FCIF volumes.
     9.1.4.5. Refer to Attachment 7 for a sample FCIF format.
     9.1.4.6. (Added-AFSOC) Part D – Squadron Read File (Optional). Squadrons/Units
     may use this section for read file information. When used, specify procedures in unit
     supplement.
  9.1.5. Publications Library. Volumes II through IV will consist of an FCIF Functional
  Publications Library according to MAJCOM directives. See AFI 33-360 for basic library
  requirements.
  9.1.5. (AFSOC) For the most current listing, refer to HQ AFSOC/A3V SharePoint and
  Central Hub (CHUB) sites.
     9.1.5.1. All publications in the library will be current and complete. MAJCOMs may
     authorize units to withhold posting of information that does not apply based on aircraft
     configuration.
     9.1.5.2. Units will establish and maintain a table of contents for the publications library
     containing, as a minimum, a listing of basic publications numbers and short titles.
     Publication dates, supplements and changes are not required.

        AIRCREW STANDARDIZATION AND EVALUATIONS VISIT (ASEVS)

A10.1. (Added-AFSOC) Introduction. The AF/IG is now the OPR for the inspection criteria
previously conducted by HQ AFSOC/A3V. Consequently, future ASEVs will be conducted
IAW AF/IG inspection criteria. To ensure thorough and comprehensive inspections standards
are maintained, HQ AFSOC will supplement the baseline guidance provided by AF/IG in the
management internal control toolset (MICT) system with functional area checklists.
HQ AFSOC/A3V will maintain the most current inspection guidelines and checklists (e.g., HAF
A3-17 Stan/Eval) and post links to them on its Stan/Eval SharePoint page for unit level review
and inspection preparation, as well as on the MICT site.
   A10.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Purpose. Units may use the checklist in whole, or part,
   depending upon mission set and MDS specifics. Ensure that all records created as a result of
   processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual
   (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force
   Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).
   Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
   Responsibility using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
   AF Forms 847 through local publications/forms managers.
A10.2. (Added-AFSOC) Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Visits
   A10.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) General. The primary ASEV purpose is to validate the unit's
   standardization programs.
   A10.2.2. (Added-AFSOC) Aircrew Testing. Test all available aircrew members, closed
   book and boldface (if applicable) who are qualified to fly unsupervised in unit aircraft and
   Lieutenant Colonel and below (not applicable for commanders and directors of operations).
   Closed book examination questions will be derived from MDS crew position MQFs;
   however, up to 10% of the questions may be from AFSOC special interest items.
       A10.2.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) If the testing rate is less than 100% of available, assigned
       and qualified crew members, additional testing may be scheduled by the ASEV Team
       Chief.
       A10.2.2.2. (Added-AFSOC) The unit will provide a list of aircrew members not
       available for testing, with valid reasons, to the ASEV Team Chief.
       A10.2.2.3. (Added-AFSOC) The passing grade is IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2,
       Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, grading policy for requisite examinations.
       Any aircrew members who fail the examination will not perform any flight related duties
       until completion of the corrective action(s) recommended by the OG/CC.
       A10.2.2.4. (Added-AFSOC) Any identified trends, from testing, will be documented in
       the ASEV report.
   A10.2.3. (Added-AFSOC) Flight Evaluations. The flight evaluation profiles should
   represent a cross section of the unit’s operational mission.
114                                              AFI11-202V2_AFSOCSUP_I 23 JULY 2013


      A10.2.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) The ASEV flight schedule should allow for evaluations of
      a variety of aircrew experience levels (i.e., senior OGV personnel, flight examiners,
      instructors, and basic-qualified crew members) to be evaluated.
      A10.2.3.2. (Added-AFSOC) The ASEV Team Chief will make the final determination
      of the minimum acceptable number of evaluations.
  A10.2.4. (Added-AFSOC) Grading. Examiners will notify the ASEV Team Chief or
  Executive Officer prior to debrief, when an examinee’s performance is less than Q1.
      A10.2.4.1. (Added-AFSOC) ASEV examiners will complete all applicable area/subarea
      grades on the crew position evaluation worksheet.
      A10.2.4.2. (Added-AFSOC) Examiners will document complete and detailed trend(s)
      to provide the unit with accurate and constructive feedback. Any trends identified, from
      flight evaluation analysis, will be documented in the ASEV report.

  Documentation. ASEV evaluations, regardless of mission profile, will indicate “SPOT” in
  the flight phase block of the AF Form 8/8a, unless conducted in conjunction with a pre-
  coordinated recurring evaluation (e.g., pyramid evaluation).
      A10.2.5.1. (Added-AFSOC) Crew Position. Enter the crew position as mission (AFI
      11-202, Vol 2 specifies the examinee’s highest qualification reflecting the intention of the
      evaluation). If instructor abilities were observed and evaluated enter the crew position as
      instructor.
      A10.2.5.2. (Added-AFSOC) Comments. All ASEV flight examiners shall use the
      following statement as the first line of the Mission Description in the section IV,
      comments block, on the AF Form 8/8a: “This evaluation was administered during a HQ
      AFSOC Aircrew Stan/Eval Visit.”
         A10.2.5.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) For instructors the comments must include specific
         areas in which instructional ability was demonstrated (IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2).
         A10.2.5.2.2. (Added-AFSOC) Document all supervisory attendance during mission
         debriefings.
         A10.2.5.2.3. (Added-AFSOC) Furthermore, if the examinee demonstrated
         exceptional skills and knowledge in all phases of the evaluation, document
         exceptionally qualified (EQ) IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2.
