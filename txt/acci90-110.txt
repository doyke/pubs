SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Revisions include adminis-
trative updates to office symbols including e-mail addresses and contact numbers; repositions Terms
Explained under Glossary of References and Supporting Information; adds Glossary of References and
Supporting Information at Attachment 1; specifies honors and ceremonies accorded DVs (DVs are
defined in Attachment 1) for international visitors; incorporates funds references under Funding for

1. Policy. Distinguished Visitors (DV) to components of Air Combat Command are a matter of com-
mand interest and should be provided every appropriate consideration. All supporting agencies must plan
and coordinate DV visits. Refer all requests to visit Nellis AFB activities and ranges to the USAF Warfare
Center Protocol Office (USAFWC/CCP), the coordinating agent for all Nellis AFB visits.

2. Responsibilities:
2                                                                       ACCI90-110 16 OCTOBER 2007


    2.1. Commanders/Staff Agency Chiefs. Commanders and staff agencies at all levels will plan for and
    execute any visit within their area of responsibility. Commanders will appoint an office or officer to
    control the overall DV program under their command. This should be the Command Section wherever
    possible. The Director of Staff, or the appointed office or officer, will evaluate the scope of interest of
    each DV visit and task an appropriate office of primary responsibility to prepare the details of the
    visit.
    2.2. Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). The OPR is responsible for providing the composition
    of the visiting party and all schedules of event details, to the DV monitor in a timely manner. The OPR
    will also coordinate all staff participation and arrange support requirements as determined by the DV
    monitor.

3. Procedures:
    3.1. Notifications. Any staff agency or subordinate unit that receives notification of visits or requests
    will direct this information to the Director of Staff and will perform the following actions.
       3.1.1. Assemble pertinent data and find out scope and purpose. If appropriate, prepare a memo for
       signature of the Commander or Director of Staff appointing the OPR for the visit. The Com-
       mander may choose, due to the nature of the visit, to keep supervision of the visit within the Com-
       mand Section and task the DV monitor to act as OPR.
       3.1.2. Notify ACC Protocol (HQ ACC/DSP) by email (accdsp@langley.af.mil) of the upcoming
       visit following the format in Attachment 2.
       3.1.3. Coordinate with the ACC Security Assistance Branch (HQ ACC/A3TS) on all visits by for-
       eign nationals and/or international organizations. This is to ensure the Secretary of the Air Force’s
       International Affairs (SAF/IA) office has approved this visit and appropriate disclosure guidance
       has been issued.
    3.2. Project Officer. Upon notification, the appointed OPR will designate a project officer to coordi-
    nate and monitor all aspects of the visit and provide pertinent information to the DV monitor. The
    project officer can use or modify the checklist at Attachment 3 to meet local planning needs.

4. Meeting and Hosting Officials:
    4.1. Senior officers of the installation, unit and staff agencies directly involved in the visit will nor-
    mally meet and host DVs. The head of the respective agencies will represent staff agencies having an
    interest in the visit, at official and social functions required by the visit plan.
    4.2. The senior commander will specify the uniform for the visit. All personnel involved in the visit
    should dress alike, in accordance with AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force
    Personnel.

5. Special Requirements and Guidance for OPRs Visit Preparation:
    5.1. If a requirement exists for static display of aircraft, aerial demonstration and orientation flights,
    the OPR will pass the requirement to the organization's operations and public affairs officer for proper
    planning, staffing and coordinating, to include higher headquarters (HHQ) approval if required. The
    OPR will have an alternate plan in case of inclement weather.
ACCI90-110 16 OCTOBER 2007                                                                                 3


   5.2. When a DV spouse is not included in the official briefings, ask the spouse of the senior ACC
   officer to act as the escort or appoint a senior ACC officer as the escort. An itinerary should be pre-
   pared by the OPR for the spouse.
   5.3. For international visitors, determine their language capability. If they are not fluent in English,
   the OPR should provide an interpreter, a person who speaks the visitor's language and understands
   their customs, to serve as translator/escort throughout the visit.
   5.4. Provide visitors the opportunity to observe their own religious and dietary customs. Special
   instructions are normally sent from HHQ in the case of official international visitors. If in doubt, the
   OPR should check with HHQ or with local sources of information. The visit OPR will find out if there
   are any dietary restrictions and/or preferences.
   5.5. DV Accorded Honors and Ceremonies. The Air Force Foreign Liaison Division (AF/CVAI) will
   advise the visited organization if honors are desired for international visitors.
   5.6. Funding for Quarters, Messing, and Transportation. Provide accommodations commensurate
   with the DV's position. This does not relieve the visitor from paying for lodging, messing and com-
   mercial transportation fees. A U.S. military escort who is responsible for settlement of these details
   will normally accompany international DVs. For official receptions and dinners, fund on an individual
   basis and normally within the following areas:
      5.6.1. International DVs (Escorted Visits). Funds are normally available to the escort officer on
      escorted visits directed by the Department of Defense, Department of Army, Navy, or Air Force.
      Do not use appropriated funds (official representation funds) to supplement funds provided by
      AF/CVAI.
      5.6.2. International DVs (Other Than Escorted Visitors) and Certain U.S. DVs. Use appropriated
      Official Representation Funds (contingency funds) in accordance with AFI 65-603, Official Rep-
      resentation Funds--Guidance and Procedures when hosting on behalf of COMACC or CV.
      5.6.3. Determine the type of funds to be used before the visit occurs. Prior coordination is
      required through the local Comptroller or Services squadron when local official representation
      funds (AFI 65-603) or special morale and welfare funds (AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated
      Funds (NAFs)) are to be used. Follow this guidance when amenities and mementos are appropriate
      for presentation.

6. Reporting:
   6.1. Headquarters Air Combat Command Notification:
      6.1.1. Report to HQ ACC/DSP by e-mail at the earliest date possible, all three-star or equivalent
      and above visits, as well as the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force.
      6.1.2. The information reported will be used to brief the ACC Commander and staff. Visit report
      may be provided to HQ ACC/DSP by e-mail to accdsp@langley.af.mil (preferred), message or
      facsimile to DSN 575-5238/COMM 757-225-5238. The format is provided in Attachment 2. Fax
      or e-mail information on short notice visits within 48 hours of notification (call to verify receipt of
      fax). See Attachment 2, Sample DV Notification Memo Format.
      6.1.3. Do not report visits by ACC personnel.
4                                                                 ACCI90-110 16 OCTOBER 2007


    6.1.4. Do not send duplicate notifications unless original information has changed. If so, indicate
    what is different on the new message.
    6.1.5. HQ AF/CVAI notifications to the ACC Directorate of Staff (HQ ACC/DS) of upcoming
    visits, do not relieve the OPR of notification procedures to HQ ACC/DSP.
    6.1.6. In the event of an unfavorable incident or a significant change to the DV itinerary, the host
    commander or designated OPR will immediately telephone the HQ ACC OPR (if assigned), HQ
    ACC/DSP or the ACC Deputy Director of Staff (HQ ACC/DSA). If appropriate, the ACC OPR
    will inform the Command Section of the incident or change.
