This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 34-2, Managing
Nonappropriated Funds. This instruction establishes procedures and responsibilities governing
the use of the POV sales area on Holloman by military personnel, their dependents, and civilian
personnel stationed or employed by the government at this installation and retired military
personnel residing in the Tularosa Basin. Personnel utilizing the POV sales area are advised that
the transfer of ownership and money are solely the responsibility of the parties to the transaction.
The U.S. Government and the U.S. Air Force are not parties to any transaction involving
vehicles in the sales area, and are therefore not responsible for any of the legalities involved.
Neither the U.S. Government nor the U.S. Air Force will act in the capacity of bailee for any
POV and both disclaim responsibility for the theft of, or damage to, any vehicle while it is
parked in the sales area. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Contact supporting records managers
as required. Refer recommended changes and questions to the Office of Primary Responsibility
(OPR) using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to 49th Force Support
Squadron Auto Hobby Shop (49 FSS/FSCTA), 280 First Street, Holloman AFB, NM 88330-
