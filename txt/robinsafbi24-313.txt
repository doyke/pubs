This instruction implements Executive Order 13150, Federal Workforce Transportation, and
DODI 1000.27, Mass Transportation Benefit Program(MTBP) requiring DOD Components to
establish a transportation incentive program in order to reduce active duty military and federal
employees' contribution to traffic congestion and air pollution and to expand their commuting
alternatives. The purpose of the program is to encourage commuting by mass transportation and
provide financial incentives to members/employees. The Transportation Incentive Program
(TIP) applies equally to all Air Force military service members and Air Force civilian employees
assigned to Robins AFB, including nonappropriated fund employees. Members of Air Force
Guard and Reserve components serving on active duty are also eligible. This instruction
prescribes policies and procedures for all individuals taking advantage of the TIP program
assigned to the 78 Air Base Wing (78 ABW) and WR-ALC. This Instruction requires collecting
and maintaining information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974. Refer recommended changes
and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using Air
Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from
the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. Ensure that all records created
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air
Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change is updated to reflect changes in guidance and procedures dealing with the
Transportation Incentive Program. The major changes include clarification of: proof of a
“commuters insurance” policy, a Georgia Public Service Commission Certificate, an application
for a DOT number, a Georgia Intrastate Motor Carrier Registration and a DOT Medical
Examination Certification which will depend on the type/size of vehicle. There is a detailed
explanation of using government vehicles to pick up Transportation Incentive Program vouchers.
1. Objectives. Provide guidance and instructions on the implementation and operation of the
Transportation Incentive Program.
2. Responsibilities. TIP manager, individual participant riders, private transportation shuttle
service owners (referred to as “shuttle” in this instruction) and supervisors must meet standards
set forth by this instruction. The 78th Logistics Readiness Squadron (78 LRS), Vehicle
Operations Element (LGRDDO), will manage the program.
     2.1. TIP Manager Responsibilities. The TIP Manager is the local responsible party who is
     knowledgeable of the program requirements. The TIP Manager reviews federal, state, and
     local requirements, provides information to program participants, e.g. riders and shuttle
     owners, and is the overall focal point for the USAF TIP program on Robins AFB. The TIP
     Manager provides TIP participants with relevant ethics materials, a copy of participant
     responsibilities under RAFBI 24-313 and DoDI 1000.27, Enclosure 2, para 10 and
     Enclosures 7 and 8. The TIP Manager refers shuttle owner/operators to AFMCI 51-201, Off
     Duty Employment, and requires them to comply with their DOD Component Command’s
     Off-duty employment requirements, which for USAF employees at Robins AFB includes
     submitting an AF IMT Form 3902.
        2.1.1. Receives and reviews participant applications and commuting cost calculation
        worksheet for completeness and eligibility. Once application is approved it is maintained
        on file with the TIP Manager. A database is maintained for all enrolled USAF TIP
        shuttle participants, e.g. each individual rider.
        2.1.2. At the end of each quarter the TIP Manager will coordinate on each rider’s TIP
        application, by reviewing the rider’s home address as listed on the TIP application and by
        reviewing commute origination point as listed on the commuting cost calculation
        worksheet. If there are no discrepancies on the commuting cost calculation worksheet the
        TIP manager will distribute a TIP voucher to the rider. If the rider’s address as listed on
        the commuting cost calculation worksheet does not match the rider’s application, the TIP
        Manager shall secure the application and the commuting cost calculation worksheet,
        require rider to provide an updated application with applicable home address and notify
        the rider’s supervisor on the discrepancy.
            2.1.2.1. If the discrepancy between home address and commuting cost calculation
            can be reconciled with the supervisor, the supervisor signs an updated TIP application
            and provides it to the TIP manager. The TIP manager will then distribute a TIP
            voucher to the rider.
            2.1.2.2. If the discrepancy cannot be reconciled with the claim for reimbursement,
            the supervisor contacts the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate.
ROBINSAFBI24-313 6 MARCH 2013                                                                    3


     2.1.3. Per DoDI 1000.27, Mass Transportation Benefit Program, para. 7(e), a minimum
     10 percent record check will occur periodically to verify the accounts of participating
     personnel. Annually, the TIP OPR shall perform a 100 percent participant re-enrollment.
     The program will be assessed according to DoDI 1000.27 and Component policy and
     procedure to affirm the program’s integrity annually.
  2.2. Participant Rider Requirements. All riders participating in TIP will comply with the
  following procedures:
     2.2.1. Meet eligibility requirements: Active duty Air Force, Air Force civilian
     employees, Air Force NAF employees, Air National Guard active duty, Air Force
     Reserve active duty, Air National Guard civilian employees, Air Force Reserve civilian
     employees, Air National Guard NAF employees and Air Force Reserve NAF employees
     are eligible to participate in the TIP program. NOTE: Per DoDI 1000.27 para. 4, TIP is a
     service specific fringe benefit. 78 LRS/LGRDDO is only authorized to manage USAF
     eligible employees. Tenant military components located on RAFB must refer to their
     respective services TIP manager for eligibility requirements.
     2.2.2. Once an eligible employee selects a registered shuttle service, the participant rider
     must complete a TIP application and a commuting cost calculation worksheet, provide
     them to a supervisor for signature, then submit them to the TIP manager for enrollment
     into the program. Once applications are verified by the TIP manager and approved by the
     Department of Transportation, Washington D. C., the rider will then receive TIP
     vouchers. A rider must keep the TIP application on file valid by updating a change in
     supervisor, home address or other change affecting commuting cost, status or
     reimbursement eligibility.
     2.2.3. Submit a change TIP Application with new supervisor, new home address or other
     substantive change within 2 weeks of a change in address, commuting cost or supervisor.
     2.2.4. Participants must disenroll upon Deployment/PCS/Separation/Retirement and
     Extended TDY or leave of more than 30 days. Participants may reapply once they meet
     eligibility requirements per this instruction.
     2.2.5. TIP participants must comply with this instruction as well as DoDI 1000.27.
         2.2.5.1. Civilian employees who do not comply with DoDI 1000.27 are subject to
         disciplinary action, including termination from federal service. A false TIP
         Application or other falsity may subject employee to criminal prosecution in federal
         court.
         2.2.5.2. Military members who do not comply with DoDI 1000.27 are subject to
         administrative action including administrative discharge. A false TIP Application or
         other falsity is subject to punitive action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
     2.2.6. Van pools are in no way connected with the Federal Transportation Incentive
     Program. As such, service is not free. TIP is not an entitlement to Department of
     Defense employees. TIP is offered as a fringe benefit, an incentive to use alternate
     means of transportation that reduce road congestion and environmental impact.
     2.2.7. Participants will not receive mass transportation benefits from any other sources.

    2.3. Private transportation shuttle service owners: Shuttle owner/operators participating in
    TIP will comply with the following procedures, as applicable.
       2.3.1. Each USAF member/employee owner/operator of a shuttle service participating in
       the Transportation Incentive Program on Robins AFB must submit an AF IMT Form
       3902 to his/her supervisor for approval. Each employee of another DOD Component
       must comply with that Component’s off duty employment requirements and provide
       proof of that to the TIP Manager.
       2.3.2. All shuttle owner/operators must comply with several other basic requirements to
       include this instruction. Before any member/employee can be reimbursed for expenses
       incurred in conjunction with the use of a shuttle service, the owner of the shuttle must
       certify that his/her activity satisfies the requirements of Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
       Title 26, Section 132 (f) and is an activity engaged in for profit as the term is interpreted
       under IRC Title 26, Section 162.
       2.3.3. Specifically, Title 26, Section 132 (f) requires:
           2.3.3.1. The vehicle used must be owned by either public authorities or by a person
           in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire.
           2.3.3.2. The vehicle used must be a highway vehicle with a seating capacity of at
           least six (6) adults (not including the driver).
           2.3.3.3. At least 80 percent of the expected mileage use of the vehicle must be for
           transporting employees in connection with their residence and place of employment.
       2.3.4. Language in IRC 26 Section 162 defining/interpreting “for profit activities” is
       broad based. As such, it is strongly recommended that all shuttle owner/operators consult
       with their attorney to determine whether all applicable requirements are met.
       2.3.5. All current and future shuttle owner/operators will have a current copy of a State
       or County issued business license for the applicable shuttle service and a current copy of
       their insurance policies issued for applicable vehicle(s) on file with the TIP manager.
       Insurance coverage must be suitable for a commercial passenger shuttle business. Each
       owner will be required to have all Federal and state requirements identified below or they
       will either not be admitted into the program or be removed from the program for not
       following      this      instruction.    The       requirements      are      listed     at

              49 CFR, subtitle B, chapter I, subchapter C. Any vehicle under those requirements
              will not require a Medical Examiners Report/Certificate.
      2.3.6. Rental vehicles, personal car-pools, van pools, ride sharing by individual riders
      often referred to as “slugs,” or employee purchased vans that do not meet the

      business phone number and email address. For owner/operators that work on Robins
      AFB, duty phone numbers and work addresses will not be accepted.
   2.4. Supervisor responsibilities: All supervisors of shuttle participants must be aware of
   their employee’s involvement in a shuttle service. Supervisors will ensure subordinate
   participants are aware of DoD ethics policies and will remind participants annually of

   calculation worksheet to submit to their supervisor. A valid TIP Application must be
 6                                                       ROBINSAFBI24-313 6 MARCH 2013


     submitted annually to rider’s supervisor for signature, then to the TIP Manager for
     enrollment. Applications will be turned in to the TIP Manager’s office, located at building
     914, between the hours of 0700 – 1600 Monday through Friday. Shuttle riders are not
     eligible to seek TIP vouchers until a valid application is on file with the TIP Manager.
        3.2.1. TDYs/Deployments/PCS/Separation/Retirement/Extended           leave.       Upon
        deployment, PCS, separation, retirement, and extended leave or TDY, participants are no
        longer eligible for TIP benefits and must be disenrolled. Participants may reapply once
        they meet eligibility requirements per this instruction.
4. TIP Vouchers.
     4.1. TIP vouchers are controlled items and will be issued to each rider quarterly. Riders will
     inform the 78 LRS TIP manager, Commercial: 478-926-4453, of any leave of absence (TDY,
     deployment, leave, etc.) so that vouchers will not be issued. Vouchers are nonrefundable.
     4.2. Monetary incentive is capped by Department of Transportation through Congress and is
     subject to change due to budgetary allowances/constraints. In the event a service provider's
     fare exceeds the capped amount, the rider is responsible for that excess amount. Failure to
     pay this out-of-pocket expense will result in removal from the program.
     4.3. Vouchers will be picked up within the first 15 days of each quarter (Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct).
     Unclaimed vouchers will be returned to the Department of Transportation. Failure to pick up
     vouchers within 15 calendar days will result in removal from the program.
     4.4. Vouchers may be picked up at Building 914, between the hours of 0700-1100 Monday-
     Friday. For pick up outside normal business hours, coordinate with 78 LRS TIP Manager at
     478-926-4453. NOTE: Riders may not use Government Motor Vehicles (GMV) to pick up
     vouchers per AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, paragraph 3.1 “…Transportation by a DOD
     motor vehicle shall not be provided when the justification is based solely on reasons of rank,
     position, prestige, or personal convenience.” This also applies to Other Government Motor
     Vehicle Conveyances (OGMVC) and Non-REMS Low Speed Vehicles (NRLSV) as they are
     for official use only per Robins AFB Instruction 24-2. Substantiated misuse of the above
     assets will result in the offending units Commander or Civilian Leader being notified to take
     action to prevent further infractions.
5. Payment to Service Providers.
     5.1. All vouchers are to be submitted to vanpool owners. Owners are not responsible for lost
     or misplaced payment. Riders are ultimately responsible.
6. Consequences.
     6.1. Failure to meet the standards set forth in this instruction will force immediate removal
     from the Transportation Incentive Program
7. TIP Disenrollment.
7.1. Shuttle owners: Once they no longer wish to participate in TIP, shuttle owners must
notify the TIP Manager for disenrollment from the program.

        7.1.1. Shuttle owners will notify the TIP Manager once riders no longer participate in
        their shuttle program.
ROBINSAFBI24-313 6 MARCH 2013                                                                  7


  7.2. Shuttle riders: Shuttle riders will notify their shuttle owner and supervisor when they no
  longer participate in a shuttle service. If riders change shuttle service, they must file
  disenrollment from their current shuttle service prior to enrollment into a new shuttle
  program.
