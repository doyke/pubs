                                               Chapter 1

                             GENERAL OPERATING INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. To provide quality lodging facilities and service to authorized personnel to maintain mis-
sion readiness and quality of life, while keeping official travel costs to a minimum.
    1.1.1. (Added-ANG) ANG installations may provide lodging accommodations, either on the installa-
    tion or in Commercial Lodging (CL), for eligible unaccompanied personnel requiring government
    lodging during IADT or AT whenever possible. Eligible unaccompanied personnel are members of
    the unit who reside beyond the established commuting distance.
    1.1.2. (Added-ANG) Lodging at no expense to the eligible unaccompanied personnel during IDT is
    not a benefit guaranteed by the ANG and is contingent upon funding and the discretion of the installa-
    tion commander/site commander.

1.2. Fund Sources. Lodging operations, to include visiting quarters and temporary lodging facilities, are
mission-sustaining functions, supported through a combination of appropriated funds (APF) and nonap-
propriated funds (NAF) as prescribed in AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and
Recreation and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, and AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated
Funds (NAFs).
    1.2.1. (Added-ANG) ANG Services (ANG/SVX) does not allocate funds to provide a lodging pro-
    gram at ANG installations. Each ANG installation providing lodging accommodations for IDT should
    include Operational and Maintenance (O&M) funds yearly in their financial plan towards this pro-
    gram. Individual squadrons at the unit should include AT lodging funds in their military personnel
    (MILPERS) funds yearly in their financial plan toward this program.
    1.2.2. (Added-ANG) Unit personnel in AT status at their assigned installation will pay for their lodg-
    ing expense utilizing their government issued credit card.

1.3. Support of Tenant Units. Host base general managers extend support to personnel assigned or on
temporary duty (TDY) to tenant and attached units. Host-tenant or inter-service support agreements must
reflect this support.
    1.3.1. (Added-ANG) ANG installations should first use other military lodging accommodations
    within the surrounding area before securing commercial lodging for eligible unaccompanied person-
    nel during IDT. Eligible unaccompanied personnel performing AT at their assigned installation are
    responsible to contact other military lodging accommodations within the surrounding area prior to the
    start date of their orders.
    1.3.2. (Added-ANG) TDY personnel to ANG installations will be lodged either on the installation
    where military accommodations are available or in CL. TDY personnel will pay their own lodging
    expense utilizing their government issued credit card.

1.4. Lodging Annual Occupancy Reporting. The general manager, at activities using the Services
Information Management System (SIMS), prepares the SIMS Unaccompanied Personnel Housing Inven-
tory and Utilization Report, and supplemental data, annually. The general manager, at activities using the
Lodging Touch System (LTS), prepares the JAS 105-occupancy report. Inclusive dates are 1 October to
AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                          5

page. This Lodging Annual Occupancy report is assigned Report Control Symbol (RCS) RCS:
HAF-SV(A)0101 and is designated emergency status code D. Immediately discontinue reporting data
requirements during emergency conditions. Discontinue reporting during MINIMIZE.

1.5. Eligible Guests in Air Force Visiting Quarters (VQ), Temporary Lodging Facilities (TLF), and
Commercial Lodging (CL) (see 2.2.6.). Table 1.1. lists personnel who qualify for Priority 1 and Prior-
ity 2 status in visiting quarters. Table 1.2. lists personnel who qualify for Priority 1 and Priority 2 status in
TLFs. Personnel listed as Priority 2 are assigned rooms on a space available basis. Within Priority 1 and

NOTES:
  1. Civilian personnel and/or their family members are Priority 1 for government lodging or commer-
     cial lodging (CL) when in a PCS status overseas. In CONUS, they are Priority 2 for government
     lodging.
  2. Do not issue a PCS member an automated contract lodging authorization or non-availability (NA)
     number. Instead, provide the member a locally devised TLE/TLA memorandum. Using LTS, you
     will register the guest in the system as a NA account (wait list). You can still provide the member
     a locally devised TLE/TLA memorandum and reference the NA account number.
  3. All foreign personnel must pay lodging service charges directly to the lodging office, except
     International Military Education and Training (IMET) enlisted personnel. Lodging requests reim-
     bursement for IMET enlisted personnel through the host base foreign training office and account-
     ing and finance office. Invoices must list names, nationality, number of days that lodging was
     provided, and total amount of charges. Lodging must also furnish a copy of each student’s travel
     orders.
  4. IMA members will pay all lodging charges, regardless of type of duty performed (i.e., active duty,
     AF Form 938, Request and Authorization for Active Duty Training/Active Duty Tour; inac-
     tive duty for training, AF Form 40A, Authorization for Individual Inactive Training, per diem
     status, or location where the duty is performed (i.e., at or away from the assigned unit/man-day

         assignment). IMA members must file for reimbursement through AFRCCAFO/FMFPT (Consoli-
         dated Accounting and Finance Office, Travel Section), 1392 Second Street, Dobbins ARB GA
         30069-4823.
     5. Unit-assigned Air Force Reserve personnel in an active duty status, to include annual tours in a
         per diem or non-per diem status, performed at home station or away from home station, will pay
         all lodging charges and file for reimbursement on a travel voucher.
     6. Unit-assigned Reserve personnel in an IDT status away from home station will pay their own
         lodging costs and file for reimbursement.
     7. Unit-assigned Reserve personnel in an IDT status at home station will not pay for their own lodg-
         ing. The unit of assignment will pay all lodging room charges via an organizational credit account
         (e.g., International Merchant Purchase Authorization Card (IMPAC)). Refer to Attachment 5 for
         billing procedures.
     8. Air National Guard (ANG) members in an active duty status for annual tours in a non per diem
         status will pay for on-base lodging or commercial lodging. ANG members will file for reimburse-
         ment through their unit of assignment.
     9. Air National Guard members in an IDT status will not pay their lodging room charges. The unit of
         assignment will pay IDT lodging charges via an organizational credit account (e.g., IMPAC).
         Refer to Attachment 4 for billing procedures. For Geographically Separated Units (GSUs), Air
         National Guard and Reserve lodging is provided in accordance with the Inter Service Support
         Agreement (ISSA) and Host Tenant Support Agreement (HTSA). NOTE: For payment proce-
         dures concerning individual and unit-assigned Air Force Reserve personnel, contact HQ AFRC/
         SVP (Programs Division, Services Directorate), Robins ARB GA, DSN 497-2103. For Air
         National Guard billing procedures, contact ANG/SVX, Andrews AFB MD, DSN 278-8177.
     10. Contract personnel traveling overseas are lodged according to the contract provisions and the
         host-nation Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).
     11. Once Priority 2 (official travel) guests receive a confirmed reservation they maintain Priority 1
         status for the duration of their stay.
     12. Unless otherwise covered by other rules in this table.
     13. Military includes US Coast Guard members.
     14. Retirees who are evacuated to a Military Treatment Facility in the United States are considered
         Priority 1 and thus allowed to make confirmed lodging reservations for the duration of their stay.
     15. AFROTC cadets participating in the Operations Air Force Program and the Base Visit Program
         are not in a per diem status. They are not charged for services provided (except for incidental
         expenses, e.g., sundries, phone charges, etc.). They are not assigned to CL, and not promised
         non-availability numbers. Reimbursement for lodging service charges is accomplished as follows:
         For the Operations Air Force Program, collect a copy of each cadet’s orders, indicate the daily
         service rate and estimated number of nights’ stay and fax a copy of the orders to HQ AFROTC/
         DOSR at DSN 492-7003 or commercial (334) 953-7003, within 5 days after check out. HQ
         AFROTC/DOSR will provide a Government Travel Account (credit card) number to pay for
         room charges. Upon check out, fax a copy of the paid bill/receipt to HQ AFROTC/DOSR. For the
         Base visit program, fill out the information at the bottom of the cadet’s special orders, where it
         says “note to lodging facility,” and fax a copy to HQ AFROTC/DOSR. All other procedures are
         the same as the Operations Air Force Program.

     the area.
     16.4. (Added) One-way travel to the duty station.
     17. (Added) All full-time employees at their assigned ANG installation (AGR and Air
     Technician) are considered to be living within the commuting distance. The unit is not
     authorized to pay lodging for ANG members employed full-time (AGR or Air Technician) for
     IDT unless required by military necessity (e.g., alert, mobilization).
     18. (Added) The unit may authorize lodging accommodations for non-eligible ANG members

NOTES:
  1. PCS-in as Priority 1 applies only to the member’s new duty assignment location, not PCS en route
     (traveling to new assignment). PCS-out as Priority 1 applies only to the member’s departing duty
     assignment location, not PCS en route (traveling to new duty assignment). Air Force recruiting
     personnel will be considered Priority 1 for assignment in the TLF at the installation closest to
     their office location regardless of their host base of assignment.
  2. Do not issue a PCS member a SIMS-generated contract lodging authorization or non-availability
     numbers. Instead, provide the member a locally devised TLE/TLA memorandum. Using LTS, you
     will register the guest in the system as a NA account (wait list). You can still provide the member
     a locally devised TLE/TLA memorandum and reference the NA account number.
  3. When military members residing in government housing (military family housing) or off-base
     housing are dislocated for emergency maintenance and repairs, they are authorized to reside in
     TLFs. When lodging fees exceed the member’s basic allowance for housing (BAH), the base may
     reduce fees down to the BAH. This does not apply to government housing occupants who are dis-
     placed as a result of programmed housing renovation/upgrade (e.g., kitchen renovations, etc.).
     Military members are authorized up to 30 days in TLF without forfeiture of BAH (DoD FMR,
     Base Level Pay Procedures, Vol 7A Ch 26).
  4. Military includes US Coast Guard members.
  5. Retirees who are evacuated to a Military Treatment Facility in the United States are considered
     Priority 1 and thus allowed to make confirmed lodging reservations for the duration of their stay.

1.6. Use of Lodging. Air Force temporary duty personnel must use on-base lodging when adequate and
available (unless waived for military necessity), and will make advance reservations when traveling to an
Air Force installation. Reservations can be made via a traveler’s home installation’s servicing commercial
travel office (CTO) or by contacting an Air Force Inn directly. The Air Force Lodging Directory can be
16                                                      AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003


found at http://www.afsv.af.mil. Reservations for CONUS operations can also be made by calling
1-888-AF-LODGE. MAJCOMs must report all lodging phone number changes to HQ AFSVA/SVOHL
immediately after the new number is available.
     1.6.1. Newly inducted enlisted members undergoing processing, orientation, or basic training, includ-
     ing follow-on technical training at a base having both government dining facilities and lodging, are
     not authorized per diem or reimbursement for lodging service charges, and will be accommodated in
     permanent party housing. However, if members have attended a PCS school and are attending fol-
     low-on training and are entitled to per diem, lodging provides accommodations.
     1.6.2. Installation commanders may establish a maximum duration of occupancy for PCS personnel
     based on availability of permanent party housing and the needs of TDY personnel up to 30 days. Stays
     beyond 30 days require forfeiture of BAH: Members can request stays beyond 30 days without forfei-
     ture of BAH for reasons of military necessity or relief of hardship (reference DoD FMR, Vol 7A, Ch
     26, Table 26-3, and DFAS-DEM 7073-1 (Base Level Pay Procedures).
     1.6.3. The installation commander reserves the right to refuse service to any guest for cause. (This
     responsibility may be delegated to the general manager). A MFR detailing the reasons for refusal
     should be sent to the Services squadron for review and filing.
     1.6.4. Before placing an official traveler in commercial lodging or issuing a non-availability number,
     lodging operations will assign guests to available rooms that meet or exceed the minimum adequacy
     standards found in Chapter 2, Table 2.1. Lodging will assign enlisted personnel to Visiting Officers
     Quarters (VOQ) when Visiting Airman’s Quarters (VAQ) are full rather than sending them off-base.
     Officers and civilians may be assigned to a VAQ when VOQs are full and the VAQ room meets mini-
     mum adequacy standards for officers and civilians. General managers are responsible for controlling
     lodging rooms to ensure efficient use of all rooms and maximum occupancy. General managers will
     review daily reports, e.g., arrivals report, departure report, reservations, etc., and make changes to res-
     ervations as necessary. The reservation staff will encourage guests to book the portion of their stay
     that can be accommodated on base at the time of “sale.” The goal is to accommodate the entire length
     of stay, but at the very least, we will accommodate them for the maximum amount of time a room is
     available. General managers will also establish a tracking system to ensure guests are contacted at
     their off-base accommodations to provide them the opportunity to move back on base once space
     becomes available.
     1.6.5. For facilities configured as VQs the following guidelines apply: A separation of general areas
     between guests that fall into different rank categories is normally desirable. To the extent possible,
     assign airmen/NCOs, officers, and aircrew members to rooms on separate floors/wings, especially
     when crew rest is an issue (where PRIME KNIGHT is established). Managers should use flexibility
     and good judgement when making these assignments. When rooms in the normally designated area
     are not available, assign guests to any available VQ room on a first-come, first-served basis. Do not
     send guests to contract quarters or issue certificates of non-availability unless there are no rooms
     available.
     1.6.6. Air Force lodging operations are not authorized to involuntarily lodge duty transient personnel
     in government lodging not meeting the minimum adequacy standards identified in Chapter 2, Table
     2.1., during normal, peacetime operations, without the approval of HQ USAF/ILVP. Installation com-
     manders may authorize lodging in facilities not meeting minimum standards for reasons of military
     necessity, such as contingency operations, natural disasters, emergencies, etc. It is inappropriate to
AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                       17


   involuntarily lodge duty transient personnel in facilities below minimum adequacy standards solely to
   reduce TDY costs. However, duty transient personnel may voluntarily accept a lodging room that
   does not meet minimum adequacy standards.

1.7. Group Travelers. The lodging office will house group travelers requiring team integrity at the same
geographical location (all on base or all off base) when specified on the group members’ travel orders. See
Attachment 6 for further details regarding the Prime Knight program.
   1.7.1. (Added-ANG) The use of AF 616, Fund Cite Authorization, will no longer be accepted at Air
   Force Lodging installations, to guarantee lodging payment for group travel.
   1.7.2. (Added-ANG) Group travel reservations can be made with the unit’s Centrally Billed Unit Res-
   ervation Account (CBURA); however, each individual will pay their lodging expense. The BURA is
   not intended to have expenses charged to this account. The sole purpose of the CBURA is to reserve
   lodging accommodations at CL establishments.

1.8. Business Suites. An installation commander may designate distinguished visitor lodging within the
visiting quarters. If the protocol office manages business suite reservations, it will release the rooms to the
lodging office for use by other travelers by 1600 each day to maximize on-base lodging utilization.
   1.8.1. No more than 5 percent of a lodging operation’s total visiting quarters will be identified as
   business suites without MAJCOM/SV approval. (MAJCOM/SVs will provide HQ USAF/ILVP and
   HQ AFSVA/SVOHL an information copy of approved waiver requests).
   1.8.2. Lodging and protocol will establish an operating instruction concerning business suite reserva-
   tions.

1.9. No-Smoking Policy. All Air Force lodging common areas and guest rooms, including TLF units, are
no-smoking areas. General managers will ensure guests are informed of this policy when making a reser-
vation and at check-in. When smoking does occur in a guest room, an efficient ionizer or deodorizer will
be used to clean the room and rid it of as much of the smoke residue as possible. Lodging operations are
authorized to charge the guest (one time per stay) for cleaning services if the guest is informed of this pol-
icy at check-in.

1.10. General Management Requirements and Responsibilities. The lodging general manager sets
the tone for the entire lodging operation and will ensure adherence to this Air Force Instruction in the
lodging operation that he/she is responsible. The manager will ensure consistent, quality service to meet
our customers’ expectations every time they stay at an Air Force Inns establishment. In those instances
when a guest takes the time to point out an area of concern or dissatisfaction, the general manager will
attempt to correct the situation as soon as possible and inform the guest of the action taken within 24
hours (by letter, if necessary).

1.11. Facility Utilization. General managers determine the number of lodging rooms required based on
Priority 1 guest historical data and future mission changes that might affect Priority 1 guest traffic. Com-
manders should consider redesignating lodging rooms/facilities as permanent party housing, or other use,
if the occupancy rate is below 75% for a period of 1 year (or 50% Priority 1 guests).
   1.11.1. HQ USAF/ILV must approve facility diversions to any other use for all facilities built with
   nonappropriated funds. (AFI 32-9002, Use of Real Property Facilities, for additional guidance.)
18                                                     AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003


     1.11.2. General managers may temporarily house newly assigned unaccompanied single permanent
     party personnel in lodging facilities if permanent party housing is not readily available. Members
     must pay the lodging service charge. Members should consult their financial services office regarding
     pay entitlements.
     1.11.3. If on-base lodging becomes unavailable for any reason, the general manager informs potential
     customers IAW procedures outlined in AFMAN 34-255, Directory of Government Quarters and Din-
     ing Facilities.

1.12. Dress and Appearance. All lodging employees must wear appropriate attire. The general manager
will wear professional business attire and will provide complete uniforms and name tags for all civilian
employees. Name tags and/or uniforms will include the Air Force Inns logo and may also include the
local lodging logo. (Examples of appropriate uniforms are; housekeepers in matching smocks/shirts and
slacks; desk clerks in slacks or skirt, and matching dress shirt and vest; managers in slacks or skirt, with a
matching dress shirt, vest, and tie or tie tab.) Military personnel assigned to lodging will wear the appro-
priate military uniform and Services organizational badge.

1.13. Employee Work and Break Areas. All lodging employee break areas must reflect the same qual-
ity standards of lodging common areas and guest rooms. The general manager will designate appropri-
ately furnished and decorated lounge areas for lodging employees to take their breaks.

1.14. Training. General managers will establish a continuing customer service training program
(approved by the MAJCOM/SV). All employees will receive training particular to their jobs (task train-
ing), as well as customer service techniques, to guarantee consistent, courteous, and professional service
to all guests. Managers must use a commercial, core training program, for use in Air Force lodging. Gen-
eral managers may receive assistance in obtaining training materials from the parent MAJCOM/SV lodg-
ing officials or HQ AFSVA/SVOHL. All lodging employee training will be documented using the
appropriate forms. In addition, military personnel training (E-1 through E-6) will be documented in the
Training and Education Automated Management System (TEAMS). Completed training forms will be
maintained in each civilian employee’s personnel record. Civilian training will be documented in the
employee’s personnel file.
     1.14.1. Initial Training. Newly hired employees must receive the following aspects of training
     within the first 3 days of work:
        1.14.1.1. Safety, security, and emergency procedures (first day of work).
        1.14.1.2. Initial training on blood borne pathogens (BBP) exposure control (to include policies,
        procedures, and equipment) for all employees whose normal duties include the possibility of occu-
        pational exposure to blood and other bodily fluids (Occupational Safety and Health Administra-
        tion annual training requirement).
        1.14.1.3. An entire lodging operation overview, to include reservations, front desk operations,
        housekeeping and maintenance.
        1.14.1.4. A lodging operation tour, to include all types of guest rooms. (Front desk/reservations
        staff members should also tour commercial lodging establishments within their first 2 weeks on
        the job and be familiar with eating establishments within the immediate vicinity.)
AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                    19


       1.14.1.5. Customer service technique instructions (e.g., greeting customers, making eye contact,
       answering the phone).
       1.14.1.6. Instruction on the impact of “first impressions” to include the importance of employee
       appearance, dress, and demeanor to lodging operation success.
       1.14.1.7. The lodging operation’s complete training program overview. (Refer to AFI 34-254,
       Services Education and Training, for more information.)
   1.14.2. Professional Certification. The Air Force recognizes the importance of life-long learning
   and continuing professional development. The general manager is encouraged to have (or be working
   toward) professional certification, such as the Certified Hotel Administrator (CHA) designation, and
   accomplish the necessary actions to keep the designation current. Other staff members are also
   encouraged to pursue certification in their specialty.
   1.14.3. Annual Training Workshop. Air Force lodging operations must hold at least one compre-
   hensive training workshop each year, for general managers and department heads. The general man-
   ager is responsible for implementing and following through on any action plans developed during this
   training workshop.

1.15. Guest Security. Guest safety and security is of the utmost importance. Accordingly, the front desk
staff must not give a guest’s room number or personal information over the telephone or to others. Guests
should also have access to information about know undesirable or hazardous locations or areas they
should refrain from visiting (refer to paragraph 2.2.17.2.).
   1.15.1. Key control procedures will be implemented to ensure security. Do not print room numbers on
   the key, key chain, or electronic door openers. If room numbers are already placed on keys or key
   chains, place the key in a small envelope to conceal the room number until replaced.
   1.15.2. Do not issue replacement keys to guests when another key is requested without positive iden-
   tification confirming that the guest is assigned to the particular room.

1.16. Community Relations. The general manager will establish a professional relationship with local
hotel/motel and tourism organizations, chambers of commerce, etc., in order to improve customer service
by sharing experiences, professional knowledge, and hospitality education opportunities.

1.17. Lodging Procedures During Emergency/Wartime Conditions. During emergency or wartime
conditions, the lodging function may be required to surge to meet contingency requirements. Contingency
lodging may be temporarily opened to accommodate large influxes of enroute TDY personnel who cannot
be housed in regular base lodging accommodations. General managers should plan for 50 square feet per
person, but may lodge personnel in less due to military necessity.
NOTE: When lodging operations are converted in direct support of contingency or wartime operations,
Space-A lodging is not authorized.
   1.17.1. The lodging staff sets up and provides 24-hour locator service for personnel in contingency
   lodging operations.
   1.17.2. Field or tent city-type arrangements: The capability to beddown augmentation/contingency
   forces will be identified using existing facilities and equipment (dormitories, family housing, etc.), or
   contract quarters. When necessary, Services identifies furnishings requirements to the base civil engi-
20                                                      AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003


     neer (CE). CE will provide minimal furnishings to meet contingency requirements, such as excess
     Furnishings Management Office (FMO) furniture from either the support base or within the region. If
     surplus stocks are not available, FMO will purchase required furnishings from appropriated funds as
     necessary, using funds earmarked for specific contingency lodging operations when appropriate. Ser-
     vices provides accountability for furnishings assets while they are in use in contingency lodging oper-
     ations. When fixed assets are insufficient or not available, War Reserve Material (WRM) assets will
     be used for planning surge capability for a main operating base (MOB), collocated operating base
     (COB), forward operating base (FOB), or bare base (BB). In such cases, primary bedding is sleeping
     bags that are clean, sanitized, and in good repair. All bases must maintain separation between contin-
     gency lodging operations and lodging desk operations. All bedspace assignments and terminations
     will be controlled separately between lodging and contingency lodging operations. The lodging desk
     will operate in coordination with Personnel Support for Contingency Operations (PERSCO) to ensure
     accountability of deployed personnel. For further guidance on planning factors, refer to the War Mobi-
     lization Plan Annex GG.
NOTE: No NAF funds are authorized in support of contingency lodging operations.
     1.17.3. Reserve and ANG personnel called to active duty under the Presidential Reserve Call-up
     (PRC) in support of wartime emergencies are entitled to per diem as authorized in the Joint Federal
     Travel Regulation (JFTR). Under these conditions, activated ANG and Reserve personnel are active
     duty TDY members. General managers must consider the following when fulfilling their lodging
     requirements:
        1.17.3.1. Give long-term TDY personnel highest consideration over short-term TDY require-
        ments for on-base lodging for the duration of the emergency. During real-world contingency oper-
        ations, all non-contingency personnel may be requested to vacate lodging to meet mission
        requirements. If necessary, move current guests off-base and change future reservations as neces-
        sary to accommodate long-term TDY personnel on base.
        1.17.3.2. If possible, assign long-term TDY members to those facilities having the most “livable”
        amenities suitable for a lengthy stay. Consider availability of kitchen facilities, large refrigerators,
        private bath, etc.

                                             STANDARDS

2.1. Lodging Facility and Guest Room Standards. DoD 4165.63-M, prescribes standards (see Table
2.1.) for transient, unaccompanied personnel housing (lodging). Personnel staying in DoD lodging opera-
tions should have the same quality facilities, furnishings, and services as they would find in a good qual-
ity, mid-level, commercial hotel. The standards identified in this AFI are designed with the customer in
mind. The customer wants consistent, quality service in all facets of the lodging operation and expects the
same quality facilities, furnishings, and service from one Air Force lodging operation to the next. Air
Force general managers, through their chain of command, are responsible for ensuring every aspect of
their operation adheres to these standards. The use of standards will also help maximize economies and
efficiencies in Air Force lodging operations. The general manager’s challenge is to meet 100% of the
standards. For a complete list of the Air Force Inns standards, see Attachment 3.

NOTES:
  1. Lodging will house Air National Guard and Reserve technicians in travel status according to the
     military grade shown on their travel orders.
  2. The net living area of a private room or suite is measured from the inside face of the peripheral
     wall and includes all enclosed, unshared spaces, and partitions. The net living area of a shared
     room is the clear area in the sleeping room allocated for an individual's bed, locker (wardrobe,
     closet), furniture, and circulation. It excludes lounges, bathrooms, hallways, and storage areas
     designated for military mobility and field gear, or equivalent. In open bay, net living area is one
     equal share per person. For a detailed explanation on measuring rooms, please see the following
     Web site: http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil (refer to the Design Group Division).

Table 2.1. (ANG) Minimum Space and Privacy Standards (for existing inventory only).
NOTES:
      3. (Added) The Training and Education Center (TEC) at McGhee-Tyson Air National Guard
      Base (ANGB), TN and the four Combat Readiness Training Centers (CRTC) – Alpena, MI;
      Gulfport, MS; Savannah, GA; and Volk Field, WI – are considered exceptions to lodging
      standards. The lodging accommodations are especially constructed to conform to particular
      needs of the TEC and CRTC locations and are deemed adequate for the occupancy to all
      personnel regardless of rank and grade.
      4. (Added) Military necessity shall override the standards of adequacy when lodging ANG
      personnel. The installation commander may waive, on a short-term basis, adequacy standards
      for mission accomplishments, contingency operation, training, or maintenance of a
      disciplined force.
      5. (Added) The installation/site commander may waive adequacy standards when necessary to
      satisfy military requirements, at locations where adequate lodging for TDY personnel are not
      available on or off the deployed installation.

     2.1.1. Adhere to the above minimum adequacy standards when obtaining contract quarters.
     2.1.2. Base SVS/CC’s submit waiver requests for unmet space and privacy standards, minimum ade-
     quacy, prescribed in Table 2.1. through the installation commander, or designated representative, to
     the MAJCOM/DRU/SV. If the waiver is supported, the MAJCOM/DRU/SV forwards the waiver to
     HQ USAF/ILVP, with a courtesy copy to HQ AFSVA/SVO, for approval. Standards contained in
     Attachment 3 are within management’s control and therefore are not waived.
     2.1.3. For new construction and renovation projects, the standard for visiting quarters is a private
     room/private bath configuration for all grades, with 280 square feet of living area. The visiting quar-
     ters design guide is available on the Agency web page.
     2.1.4. Measuring Compliance with Standards. General managers will conduct self-assessments of
     their operations using the Lodging Golden Eagle Standards checklist.

2.2. Guest Services. Air Force lodging guests want consistent service when they stay in an Air Force
Inn. The guest service (operational) standards outlined here are designed to ensure consistent service to
our guests for the duration of their stay, from reservation to check-out. (See Attachment 3.)
     2.2.1. VQ Reservations. The reservation process is typically the guest’s first encounter with the
     lodging operation. Therefore, lodging personnel who accept reservations must be thoroughly trained
     to conduct this procedure as efficiently and smoothly as possible. Air Force lodging accepts reserva-
     tions for Priority 1 travelers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on a first-come, first-served basis, without
     regard to rank or listing within Priority 1. Non-automated lodging operations use AF Form 2506, Res-
     ervation for Individuals, and AF Form 2507, Reservation for Groups. Lodging operations operat-
     ing less than 24 hours must have the capability to accept reservations via answering machines after
     normal duty hours.
        2.2.1.1. At the time lodging confirms the reservation request, the staff must inform TDY person-
        nel whether their reservation is confirmed for on-base lodging or contract lodging (CL). If on-base
        or CL lodging is not available, provide the guest with a non-availability (NA) number.
AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                   23


         2.2.1.1.1. When lodging authorizes CL, provide the traveler the name and phone number of
         the commercial hotel or motel within one duty day of the reservation.
         2.2.1.1.2. When lodging authorizes a NA number, assist the traveler in finding accommoda-
         tions, e.g., hotel phone number, fax a copy of orders, provide map, etc.
         2.2.1.1.3. The member is authorized CL or a NA number if adequate lodging is unavailable
         on-base for the entire TDY period.
         2.2.1.1.4. If a registered Priority 1 guest (on-base, CL, or with a NA number) must extend the
         TDY period, lodging will consider this extension as a new requirement and handle it accord-
         ingly. The general manager will issue another NA number if on-base lodging or CL is not
         available for the extended TDY period.
         2.2.1.1.5. Lodging will offer on-base lodging upon availability for the remainder of the TDY
         period to travelers who desire on-base lodging but are assigned to CL or issued a NA number.
         2.2.1.1.6. If space becomes available in on-base lodging after CL reservation confirmation or
         NA number issuance (see 2.2.6. and 2.2.7.), lodging should make every attempt to notify the
         traveler of the change and encourage the traveler to stay on-base. NOTE: Although the trav-
         eler is not required to stay in on-base lodging after he/she has already received CL reservation
         confirmation or been issued a NA number, lodging should encourage travelers to stay on-base
         in an effort to maximize occupancy.
         2.2.1.1.7. If Priority 1 travelers arrive without a reservation, or arrive after 1800 but did not
         make prior arrangements for late arrival, and desire on-base lodging, but on-base lodging is
         full, lodging may assign the Priority 1 traveler CL or issue a NA number if no CL space exists.
         If the traveler desires on-base quarters, lodging makes an on-base reservation (if available) for
         the remaining period of the TDY or for the maximum period available.
         2.2.1.1.8. (Added-ANG) Eligible ANG members should advise the lodging manager at least
         30 days in advance of their lodging requirements. This allows the ANG unit to secure the
         required rooms at a military lodging accommodation or CL.
            2.2.1.1.8.1. (Added-ANG) Eligible ANG members performing AT, at their assigned
            installation, are responsible to reserve their own lodging reservations at the designated CL
            facility or military lodging. Contact the Services full-time technician for the list of current
            CL accommodations.
         2.2.1.1.9. (Added-ANG) Eligible ANG members wishing to share a room with ineligible
         dependents may do so provided there is neither an additional cost to the government nor a
         reduction in needed occupancy.
  2.2.2. TLF Reservations. Reservation requests must include an expected arrival time and date.
     2.2.2.1. PCS status guests must present PCS orders or the special order number, date, and issuing
     headquarters before or at the time of registration.
     2.2.2.2. Personnel visiting hospital patients must give the patient’s name with the reservation
     request.
     2.2.2.3. Personnel traveling for the purpose of house-hunting must show a copy of the leave
     authorization verifying permissive TDY status; or a copy of PCS, retirement, or separation orders;
24                                                     AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003


        or the special order number, date, and issuing headquarters, either before or at the time of registra-
        tion.
        2.2.2.4. If Priority 1 guests occupy all TLFs, and other Priority 1 personnel request TLFs, the gen-
        eral manager keeps their requests on a standby basis for a reasonable time, pending cancellation of
        reservations or early guest departure. Lodging fills vacancies from these standby reservations on a
        first-come, first-served basis before assigning personnel from lower priorities.
        2.2.2.5. The maximum TLF stay for Priority 1 guests (members arriving/departing PCS, separat-
        ing, or retiring; hospital outpatients, friends/relatives of inpatients, etc.) is 30 days. The general
        manager may adjust/reduce the maximum stay considering PCS and hospital outpatient demand
        for lodging to maximize TLF availability for Priority 1 guests. The installation commander may
        grant extensions beyond 30 days on a case-by-case basis. The commander may delegate this
        authority to the Services commander or division chief. PCS members performing an advance
        house-hunting trip (e.g., not performed in conjunction with actual move) are limited to 10 days. In
        overseas areas, the general manager may grant extensions if this reduces TLA costs and does not
        create hardship for other potential guests. Stays past 30 days may affect BAH entitlement. Mem-
        bers should consult their financial services office for guidance.
     2.2.3. Guaranteed and Non-guaranteed Reservations. Official duty travelers, i.e., TDY/PCS,
     must use their government travel card (GTC) to make room reservations and pay all lodging room fees
     per Public Law 105-264 unless exempt from GTC use (exemptions should be reflected on official
     travel orders). Non-guaranteed reservations are subject to release at 1800 and the room made available
     to other guests. Lodging will inform guests of the cancellation policy when the reservation is made.
     2.2.4. Space Available Reservations. Lodging will accept and confirm reservations for Priority 2
     (space available) guests up to 24 hours in advance of their arrival date, for up to three night accommo-
     dations, space permitting. Priority 1 customers will not “bump” Priority 2 customers with confirmed
     reservations, nor will they bump them once they are assigned quarters for a specific period of time.
     (Installation commanders may establish a policy limiting the number of days Space A guests can stay
     in on-base lodging to no more than 30 days a year.) Installations may send requests to increase the
     window for making Space-A reservations, as well as the length of stay through their MAJCOM for
     approval. (MAJCOM/SVs will provide an information copy of approved waiver requests to HQ
     USAF/ILVP and HQ AFSVA/SVOHL.)
        2.2.4.1. Space-A guests requesting lodging should be assigned to uncommitted (not occupied or
        reserved) lodging rooms upon arrival. Space-A guests must not be placed on a waiting list unless
        all rooms are occupied or specifically reserved. If all lodging rooms are committed, lodging may
        establish a waiting list (first-come, first-served) until 1800. After 1800, lodging assigns all vacant
        rooms resulting from no-shows of personnel with non-guaranteed hold reservations to remaining
        Space-A guests on a first-come, first-served basis.
     2.2.5. Commercial Lodging (CL). Air Force lodging operations, in conjunction with the local base
     contracting office, will attempt to negotiate reduced rates for commercial lodging accommodations in
     order to provide eligible guests alternative lodging when adequate on-base lodging is not available.
     The negotiated rates for CONUS CL establishments may not exceed the lodging portion of the local
     area per diem rate authorized by the JFTR, Volume 1, excluding taxes. The negotiated rates and appli-
     cable taxes for OCONUS CL establishments should not exceed authorized local area per diem rates.
AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                   25


     2.2.5.1. General managers provide the contracting office with a Performance Work Statement
     (PWS) or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) detailing the specific services and conditions
     required by the CL establishment or apartment complex based on local needs. CL for PCS families
     should include accommodations with suites and kitchen facilities if available. (A sample MOU
     and PWS are available on the Agency Web page.)
     2.2.5.2. Lodging must keep records showing: a) the reason CL was used when on-base lodging
     was not optimally utilized (no-shows, team integrity, etc.), and b) obligation authorities, as pre-
     scribed by the servicing accounting and finance office.
     2.2.5.3. The general manager will establish requirements-type contracts when circumstances war-
     rant, such as when it is known in advance that a specific number of rooms are needed for a fixed
     time period (e.g., Air Reserve Component (ARC) Unit Training Assembly (UTA) weekends).
     2.2.5.4. Base lodging, contracting, military public health, and fire protection officials must visit
     off-base commercial lodging establishments, when initially considered for use as commercial
     lodging, to ensure they meet the PWS/MOU conditions. Contracting, military public health, and
     fire protection officials will provide the general manager written reports/assessments for each
     establishment visited. General managers will also conduct, and document, annual visits at all CL
     establishments. NOTE: When using MOUs, contracting officials are not required to visit CL
     establishments.
     2.2.5.5. General managers will provide travelers assigned to CL information about base facilities,
     telephone numbers, and hours of operation. Managers should also have information available
     about the commercial hotel, transportation arrangements, and check-in and check-out procedures.
     General managers will make customer comment forms available to guests assigned to CL to
     obtain feedback regarding the service provided. The general manager ensures comment cards
     received at the CL establishment are picked up and reviewed, with appropriate actions taken and
     documented.
     2.2.5.6. Lodging assigns families to CL on a voluntary basis when TLFs are fully occupied or
     space is not available in the VQ. When the family is referred to CL or makes their own arrange-
     ments, lodging must retain a copy of the locally devised Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) or
     Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA) letter, that the member will submit to finance for reim-
     bursement for off-base lodging.
     2.2.5.7. When authorizing lodging at a CL establishment, lodging will provide a letter of authori-
     zation identifying the traveler and verifying duty status. This authorization will be provided to the
     hotel/motel prior to the guest’s arrival (via fax, e-mail, etc.). The traveler is not required to come
     to lodging to pick up the letter of authorization. The CL establishment will develop procedures to
     provide the traveler a copy of this authorization at check-in. The CL agreement entitles duty status
     travelers to the agreed government rate for the specified period. The traveler retains this authoriza-
     tion and submits it with his/her travel voucher.
  2.2.6. Non-Availability Numbers. Lodging issues TDY personnel a NA number at the time lodging
  reservations are requested or NLT one duty day following the reservation request, if adequate govern-
  ment lodging is not available (unless adequacy standards are waived due to military necessity).
     2.2.6.1. Per JFTR, Vol. 1, government quarters are considered not available when the TDY is less
     than 24 hours. Therefore non-availability numbers are not issued in such circumstances. This
26                                                      AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003


        should be stated on the member’s travel orders or the TDY member should note this on his/her
        travel voucher.
        2.2.6.2. Lodging does not issue NA numbers to ARC units in an inactive duty, non per diem status
        when at home station.
        2.2.6.3. The general manager issues NA numbers only if the installation is listed in AFMAN
        34-255 as having lodging facilities available.
     2.2.7. Transient Aircrew Lodging. Lodging provides a private room/private bath to transient air-
     crew members 0-1 and above (accommodations may include a shared kitchen and/or living area). For
     enlisted transient aircrew members, lodging provides a private room and a private or shared bath. Air-
     crew members are defined as anyone on the flight crew order. Ensure gender is considered when
     assigned lodging to aircrews. Crew integrity will be maintained--all members of the same crew will be
     housed together, either all on base or all off base. If a crew is divided into multiple buildings on base,
     no more than two stops will be required to pick up all crew members. NOTE: Exceptions may be
     made during contingencies.
        2.2.7.1. When construction or maintenance in the vicinity of aircrew quarters could interrupt crew
        rest, general managers will not assign aircrew members to buildings in the area.
        2.2.7.2. Lodging may assign other TDY personnel to transient aircrew accommodations if not
        required for aircrews and other on-base lodging is not available. When assigning other TDY per-
        sonnel to aircrew accommodations, advise them of the varied aircrew members sleeping hours,
        and ask them to refrain from making any noise or disturbance that could interrupt crew rest.
        2.2.7.3. Lodging will maintain aircrew integrity by housing the entire aircrew either on base or off
        base. If housed on base, lodging will house them as close together as possible. If lodged off base,
        lodging will house the aircrew in one commercial establishment.
        2.2.7.4. The installation commander or the aircraft commander may waive aircrew lodging
        requirements on a temporary basis for reasons of military necessity.
        2.2.7.5. Transient aircrews may use AF Form 2282, Statement of Adverse Affect--Use of Gov-
        ernment Facilities, at Air Force, Army, Navy, or Marine Corps installations when available tem-
        porary lodging does not meet Air Force standards for aircrews. When adequate government
        lodging is available, but does not meet special mission support requirements or crew integrity
        requirements, or the host installation commander has determined that the requirements cannot be
        supported, the members may obtain commercial accommodations at their own expense. In these
        cases, the general manager will not issue NA numbers. The TDY member is responsible for filing
        the AF Form 2282 at their permanent duty base.
     2.2.8. Prime Knight. (See Attachment 6)
     2.2.9. Signage. Proper signage is necessary to direct lodging guests to the lodging reception center
     and to their rooms. The general manager will make every effort to ensure the following signage is in
     place:
        2.2.9.1. Directional signs from the base main gate(s) to the lodging reception center(s).
        2.2.9.2. Illuminated exterior sign(s) identifying the lodging reception center and all other lodging
        facilities.
AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                     27


     2.2.9.3. Illuminated signs identifying lodging facility numbers.
     2.2.9.4. The general manager will ensure directional signs are placed at each lodging guest facil-
     ity entrance, and on each floor in the case of multi-story buildings, indicating the room location,
     room numbers on each exterior guest room door, and where vending machines, laundry facilities,
     etc., are located.
  2.2.10. Parking. There must be adequate and designated vehicle parking for guest registration with a
  separate area for passenger and baggage unloading/loading. All facility parking areas must be well
  marked, cleaned, swept, free of debris, and adequately lighted at night. Where feasible, each Distin-
  guished Visiting Quarters (DVQ) will have a designated parking space as close as possible to the
  room.
  2.2.11. Front Desk Operations. The front desk staff has the opportunity to make a lasting, favorable
  impression on the guest. The front desk staff will be proactive, attentive, and professional, always
  striving to anticipate guests’ needs and “make things right” for them.
     2.2.11.1. Desk clerks will ask to see a government identification card to verify eligibility. Front
     desk staff must acknowledge all guests (e.g., make eye contact, smile) and greet them in a profes-
     sional, courteous manner.
     2.2.11.2. Front desk staff must ensure that guests’ immediate needs (e.g., registration, information
     on Services activities/eateries, local points of interests and restaurants, etc.) are met in a friendly,
     efficient manner.
     2.2.11.3. Front desk staff will provide guests with professionally made, easy-to-use maps, direct-
     ing them to their rooms upon check-in (if the guest room is in a different facility from the recep-
     tion center/registration desk).
     2.2.11.4. At least one front desk staff member must be in the immediate vicinity of the front desk
     at all times.
     2.2.11.5. The front desk must be staffed 24 hours a day. (MAJCOM/SVs have the authority to
     waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis, for up to 1 year, and will provide HQ USAF/ILVP
     and HQ AFSVA/SVOHL an information copy of any such waivers.)
  2.2.12. Room assignments. Unaccompanied male and female guests will not share sleeping rooms
  or bathrooms, but may have adjacent bedrooms with a kitchen and/or living area between them if the
  kitchen/living area has two doors with functioning locks on both the inside and outside of each door.
     2.2.12.1. (Added-ANG) Married couples on duty status may be lodged together if private sleep-
     ing facility and a private bathroom are available. In recognition of the need to accommodate the
     mission, this request is desired but not mandatory for deployment and exercises.
     2.2.12.2. (Added-ANG) The installation/site commander may allow for single occupancy as
     space availability, financial consideration, and military necessity permits for eligible members
     performing IDT. Rooms will be assigned based upon the designated rank or position that the
     installation/site commander has deemed eligible for a private room for on base or CL.
  2.2.13. Check-in/Check-out. Check-in and check-out must be completed as promptly as possible.
  Once waited on, guests checking in with a reservation should be checked in within 3 minutes. Guests
  arriving without a reservation should be checked in within 5 minutes. Do not let a guest stand in line

     without acknowledging their presence. Non-automated lodging operations use AF Form 2505, Guest
     Registration, to collect information relative to the guest’s stay.
        2.2.13.1. Normal check-in time is 1400. However, guests may check in at any time if rooms are
        available. Normal check-out time is 1100. MAJCOM/SVs may approve changes to these standard
        times due to local requirements on a case-by-case basis, and provide an information copy of the
        waiver to HQ USAF/ILVP and HQ AFSVA/SVOHL. A late fee equal to the daily room rate (plus
        surcharge/assessment fee) may be assessed, at the general manager’s discretion for late checkouts.
        2.2.13.2. At check-in, confirm the room type, rate, and departure date (mentioning check-out
        time). Do not charge guests a deposit for the room key or charge for lost keys.
        2.2.13.3. At check-out, ask the guest if their stay was satisfactory. Offer them a chance to com-
        plete a customer comment card. Thank departing guests and give an appropriate farewell, such as,
        “Hope you enjoyed your stay.”
        2.2.13.4. Establish an express check-out system for transient aircrews and Distinguished Visitors
        (DV) staying in on-base lodging.
     2.2.14. Group Registration. The general manager must establish procedures to efficiently pre-block
     and assign rooms and check-in guests who are part of a group. This registration may take place at a
     location other than the primary lodging reception center front desk if the size of the group warrants it.
     2.2.15. Luggage Storage. Lodging will provide guests secure luggage storage service. For those
     guests who arrive before the normal check-in time, and when no rooms are immediately available,
     offer to store their luggage in a secure luggage storage room located in, or immediately adjacent to,
     the lobby. Also, ensure the guest is made aware a luggage storage room is available for use on the day
     of check-out, if necessary. Verify guest identification is on each item stored. Provide the guest with a
     receipt for each item stored.
        2.2.15.1. Provide luggage carts where feasible.
     2.2.16. Endorsing Civilian TDY Orders. The general manager, or designated representative, will
     endorse TDY orders of all civilian employees who occupy on-base government lodging to entitle
     them to limited use of exchange and service facilities. This can be accomplished with a rubber stamp
     containing the following statement: (“The individual’s name”) is assigned to on-base government
     lodging at this installation for the period of TDY indicated on these orders, and is eligible to use the
     base theater, Services activities, and exchange facilities, if otherwise authorized by the commander,
     according to Air Force Joint Instruction (AFJI) 134-211, Army and Air Force Exchange Service
     (AAFES) Operating Policies, and AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility.
     (SIGNED) (DATE)
     NAME AND TITLE
     2.2.17. Guest Rooms. The guest room is the heart and soul of Air Force lodging operations. Every
     effort should be made to ensure our guests have clean, comfortable rooms that afford them a good
     night’s rest. All lodging employees have a significant role in this effort. The room should be attrac-
     tively furnished, fully supplied, clean, and properly maintained to ensure the guest a pleasant stay.
     Detailed guest room amenities, furnishings, and supplies standards are in Attachment 3.
        2.2.17.1. Guest Room Accessories and Amenities. Air Force lodging rooms are distinguished
        by the attention to detail that is put into the rooms to make them as comfortable as possible for our
AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                   29


     guests. To ensure consistent service from one Air Force Inn to the next, our lodging operations
     must provide our guests the same standard accessories and amenities. See Attachment 3 for the
     detailed list of standard Air Force Inn accessories and amenities.
     2.2.17.2. Guest Information. It is important that our guests feel welcome and comfortable in
     their “home away from home.” Each room will have a guest information book prominently dis-
     played that includes a welcome letter from the general manager on the first page (and how they
     may contact the duty manager). Ensure information is available pertaining to local areas and con-
     ditions. Lodging will also list occupant responsibilities in guest room information books. See
     Attachment 3 for a detailed listing of what is required in the guest information book.
  2.2.18. Occupant Responsibilities. Occupants are responsible for their conduct and the conduct of
  their guests, and/or family members, while in government lodging. Their actions must not infringe on
  the rights of others. Occupants will also:
     2.2.18.1. Conserve utilities, and comply with fire, health, and safety regulations.
     2.2.18.2. Reimburse lodging for damage beyond fair wear and tear, and for missing government
     property caused by abuse or negligence on their part or by their guests. AFMAN 23-220, Reports
     of Survey for Air Force Property, or AFI 34-202, Protecting Nonappropriated Fund Assets, gov-
     ern the assessment of loss or damage to a lodging unit by a guest. The general manager processes
     a report of survey on loss or damage to NAF assets in accordance with AFI 34-202.
     2.2.18.3. Obtain appropriate care for their pets. Pets are not authorized in any type of transient
     lodging or on lodging premises. The general manager will ensure a list of local pet kennels is
     available.
  2.2.19. The Air Force Inns Promise. All Air Force lodging guest rooms/units will have a small
  placard that carries the Air Force Inns Promise, “Forget a Travel Item?” information, and environ-
  mentally-friendly “Save the Towels” information.
     2.2.19.1. The Air Force Inns Promise: “Ensuring our guests have a clean, comfortable room to
     guarantee a good night’s rest and pleasant stay is our goal. If any part of your stay with us is not
     satisfactory, please just let the general manager or front desk staff know so they can try to ‘make it
     right’.”
     2.2.19.2. Forget a Travel Item?: “Welcome! We have provided you with a few complimentary
     items to get you through your first night’s stay. If you forgot to pack any other standard toiletry
     item (toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, shaving cream, etc.), please come see us at the front desk. We
     should have what you need available for purchase.”
     2.2.19.3. Save the Towels: “All of the water and detergents used to wash hotel towels and linens
     each day all over the world puts a heavy burden on the environment. If you’d like to reuse your
     towels, just hang them on the towel racks. If you want your towels replaced, please just leave them
     on bathroom floor or in the tub.”
  2.2.20. Housekeeping and Preventive Maintenance. The housekeeping staff plays a very important
  role in ensuring guests enjoy their stay and must ensure all lodging rooms and common areas are clean
  and orderly (the room is neat and everything works). All housekeepers must provide guests with
  friendly, prompt, professional service that reinforces customer service. Housekeeping service must be
  provided within 30 minutes of a guest’s request during normal working hours.
30                                                    AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003


        2.2.20.1. Guest requests for towels or other housekeeping supplies must be fulfilled as soon as
        possible, but no later than 20 minutes after the request during normal working hours; after normal
        duty hours, towels, spare light bulbs, toilet paper, etc., will be made available at the front desk.
        2.2.20.2. In addition to full room and common area cleaning, accomplish deep cleaning and pre-
        ventive maintenance checks quarterly.
        2.2.20.3. Housekeepers will use locally developed housekeeping/preventive maintenance check-
        lists to cover such areas as mattress rotation (at least once every three months) and carpet care
        (cleaning and repairs).
     2.2.21. Quality Assurance Inspection and Review. The installation commander (or his/her desig-
     nee) inspects a sampling of all types of lodging at least quarterly and is highly encouraged to stay
     overnight semi-annually. The general manager maintains a record of these inspections to include
     dates, facilities visited, and comments.
        2.2.21.1. The general manager will inspect at least 1-2 percent of guest rooms (each room type)
        on a weekly basis (and maintain documentation of inspections for at least 1 year).
        2.2.21.2. At least two members of the lodging management staff must conduct formal lodging
        common area inspections and at least 25 percent of the guest rooms each quarter and document
        their findings (maintain inspection documentation for at least 1 year).
        2.2.21.3. The general manager and other lodging staff members are encouraged to stay overnight
        (in all room types) once a quarter as part of the overall quality assurance program, and document
        their stay. Other Services employees are also encouraged to participate in this program. Individu-
        als performing this service do not pay service charges.
        2.2.21.4. The lodging staff will conduct safety self-inspections of all lodging facilities and opera-
        tions, using checklists from Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) Standard 91-1,
        Billeting Operations (See your local safety office for additional information).
     2.2.22. Lost and Found. The general manager must establish efficient procedures and operating
     instructions for the effective handling and return of lost-and-found items to their rightful owners.
     Store all items in a secure area. The housekeeping staff must maintain a log annotating all found prop-
     erty by building, room, date found, by whom and disposition of the property. This log is transferred to
     the front desk when housekeeping is not open. Every attempt should be made to contact departed
     guests as soon as possible regarding their forgotten belongings.

2.3. Automation. Most Air Force lodging operations are fully automated. All reservation, registration,
accounting, and management functions must be utilized through the automated system. When situations
such as power outages, bad weather or maintenance problems arise, manual procedures must be used. All
manual forms must be accounted for and controlled. (Contact HQ AFSVA/SVOHL, DSN 487-8875, for
the electronic files of forms, if necessary.)

2.4. Marketing. In conjunction with the Marketing Office, Air Force lodging operations will develop a
marketing plan and work with other Services activities (e.g., golf course, marina, outdoor recreation, ITT,
clubs, etc.) to promote all Services operations.
     2.4.1. Lodging operations will use the Air Force Inns logo on signage, stationery, and other business
     items to help promote their establishment as a guest-oriented, professionally managed operation.
AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                               31


  2.4.2. Lodging operations are encouraged to develop a home page that can be accessed via the Inter-
  net. The home page should include guest information and a detailed map indicating the location of the
  lodging operation. Please inform HQ AFSVA/SVOHL if a Web page is established so a “hot link” can
  be established between the lodging operation’s home page and the Air Force Services Agency home
  page.

                                                Chapter 3

                                      MANAGING RESOURCES

3.1. Resource Protection . The general manager must ensure adequate procedures are established and
followed in accordance with AFI 34-202 to protect all lodging assets against misappropriation, misuse,
damage, or loss. This includes cash control procedures, physical safeguards, key control, and merchandise
and property control. General managers will consult their local security forces to determine the require-
ment for intrusion detection systems, surveillance cameras, or duress alarms.

3.2. Base Lodging Fund (BLF). Each base establishes a base lodging nonappropriated fund instrumen-
tality (NAFI) in accordance with AFI 34-201. The base lodging general manager will manage the lodging
activity to meet financial standards established by HQ USAF/ILV and their MAJCOM/SV. The base
Resource Management Flight Chief (RMFC) is the fund custodian.

3.3. Command Lodging Fund (CLF). Each MAJCOM with multiple bases must establish a CLF in
accordance with AFI 34-201, Chapter 3.6. MAJCOMs will ensure their base lodging activities meet
financial standards established by HQ USAF/ILV. MAJCOMs may transfer lodging funds between lodg-
ing facilities within the command via the CLF to assist base lodging activities as necessary.

3.4. Transfer of NAF Property. The general manager, working with the Services logistics manager,
may transfer NAF-procured property to APF for maintenance when allowed by AFI 34-201 and AFI
65-106. Lodging NAF property will not be transferred to a non-lodging entity. Dispose of lodging NAF
property in accordance with AFI 34-209, Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting,
and AFMAN 34-214, Procedures for Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting.

3.5. Funding. The general manager complies with AFI 65-106 for funding lodging operations.

3.6. Service Charge Rates. MAJCOMs establish command-wide service charge rates at the minimum
amount necessary to cover the cost of providing quality lodging facilities and service to authorized guests.
The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Cost and Economics, SAF/FMC, establishes Air Force maximum
lodging rates.
     3.6.1. Lodging will charge all occupants the same rate for similar accommodations, regardless of duty
     status or priority. The installation commander may waive the TLF room charge for additional units
     occupied by large families. NOTE: The TLF waiver only applies to Priority 1 guests. Space-A guests
     will incur room charges for additional rooms. The TLF assessment charge, currently $6.00 CONUS
     and $8.00 OCONUS, must be paid in all cases.
     3.6.2. Lodging operations will be managed so lodging NAFI cost centers are self-sustaining. For
     MAJCOMs with multiple bases, this is at the CLF level. MAJCOMs will generate sufficient funds for
     capital improvements/replacement.
     3.6.3. Lodging will not charge more than the single occupancy daily rate for visiting quarters accom-
     modating two or more family members. If rooms are configured for double occupancy, and both
     guests are on official orders, each will pay the full room rate.
AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                   33


   3.6.4. MAJCOM/SVs, in coordination with the MAJCOM/FM, prepare lodging service charge rate
   determination packages annually and submit them to Headquarters Air Force Services Agency, Field
   Activities Division (HQ AFSVA/SVFA) for review. Service charge rates will be sufficient to pay
   operating expenses, annual capital requirements, surcharge, and TLF user assessments. (Any request
   for exception to Air Force maximum lodging rates must be forwarded through HQ AFSVA/SVFA and
   Headquarters United States Air Force, Resource Management Division (HQ USAF/ILVF) to SAF/
   FMC, 1130 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1130.)
   3.6.5. At overseas operations experiencing financial difficulty due to foreign currency fluctuations,
   the installation commander can authorize service charge increases for up to 90 days.

3.7. Payment Procedures. All Air Force lodging guests must pay the established daily service charge for
the type of accommodation used. All lodging guests must provide a valid credit card when making their
reservation and at time of check-in (unless noted as an exception in Table 1.1. where the lodging bill is
not paid by the individual). Guests may pay in advance at check-in with cash or check; however, they
must still have a credit card on file. Those guests paying with a credit card can have their credit card
charged (sales function) at check-in or wait until check-out to have their lodging charges billed to their
credit card unless staying over 15 days in the TLF or VQ. NOTE: Exception to these procedures are unit
paid bills for Reserve and Guard personnel. Reserve component units must pay using an IMPAC or cen-
tral billed account within 20 days of the actual stay (check-out day). This note applies to all Services.
   3.7.1. All guests checking in will sign the guest registration form that advises them lodging is autho-
   rized to apply any unpaid charges to their credit card.
   3.7.2. All VQ long-term guests (staying over 15 days), whether paying by cash, check, or credit card,
   will return to the front desk at 15-day intervals to verify and pay their lodging bill or pay in advance
   for the next 15 days.
       3.7.2.1. Cash/check-paying guests will pay in advance for next 15 days or remaining days of
       occupancy.
       3.7.2.2. Credit card-paying guests will have their credit card processed for charges incurred over
       the previous 15 days.
   3.7.3. All TLF guests staying over 15 days, whether paying by cash, check, or credit card, must come
   back to the front desk at the 15-day mark.
       3.7.3.1. Cash/check-paying guests will pay in advance for remaining days of occupancy.
       3.7.3.2. Credit card-paying guests will have credit cards processed for charges incurred over the
       past 15 days.

3.8. Financial Planning. The planning and budgeting process helps the general manager forecast reve-
nues, program expenses, and fund capital requirements. Managers should work with the unit APF
resource advisor to develop annual APF budgets. They should also work with the RMFC to develop NAF
income and expense operating budgets and NAF requirement budgets, that include capital fixed asset
items and those meeting bulk purchase criteria. (Refer to AFI 34-201, AFI 34-202, AFI 34-209, and
AFMAN 34-212, Control Procedures for Protecting NAF Assets.) Managers are not allowed to budget for
the same expense from APFs and NAFs. (Refer to AFI 65-106 for more detailed information on the
appropriate fund source.)
34                                                    AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003


     3.8.1. Capital Requirements Planning Standards Guide. HQ AFSVA/SVOHL will develop a standard
     CapitalRequirements Planning Standards Guide and distribute it to all MAJCOMs. General managers
     will develop and maintain a 5-year capital improvement plan approved by the MAJCOM/SV. General
     managers will also participate in the installation Quarters Improvement Committee meetings and
     ensure lodging’s capital improvement requirements (facilities, furnishings, and equipment, both APF
     and NAF) are adequately addressed in the Installation Quarters Improvement Plan (see AFI 32-6005,
     Unaccompanied Housing Management) and made known to The Civil Engineer’s Furnishings Man-
     agement Office and base senior leadership. It is important to execute approved annual capital require-
     ments in a timely manner to maintain quality lodging facilities, furnishings, and equipment. It is
     critical to ensure APF furnishings and appliance requirements are worked closely with the FMO to
     allow adequate lead-time for ordering, receiving, warehouse storage (if necessary), and delivering
     lodging items in time for beneficial occupancy dates of lodging facility renovations. Refer to AFI
     32-6004, Furnishings Management, for more detailed guidance regarding facility and furnishings
     standards, individual responsibilities, budget requirements, warehouse management, furnishings
     accountability, and appliance management.

3.9. Operating Expenses. General managers should consistently monitor and manage the operating cost
per occupied room (CPOR). Labor is the single largest and most controllable expense item impacting
CPOR. MAJCOMs will determine personnel cost goals based on historical financial data. For further
guidance on controlling labor expenses, see Attachment 6.

3.10. Sundry Sales. Snack and beverage sales are required guest services.
     3.10.1. General managers will ensure every guest has a reasonable opportunity to obtain sundry items
     24 hours per day (readily available). In most operations, this can be accomplished using a combination
     of front desk sales and vending machines strategically located throughout the lodging facilities. In
     those rare instances where building layout precludes vending machines, room stocking may be used.
     The final determination will be based on providing quality customer service and not the convenience
     of the lodging staff. However, you must continue to provide sundry items in all distinguished visitor
     suites. General managers manage sales and structure pricing so the gross margin from sales is suffi-
     cient to cover the cost of goods.
     3.10.2. The general manager will ensure sundries are inventoried and restocked daily (including
     weekends).
     3.10.3. Post charges to guest folios in a timely manner. To enhance internal controls in business
     suites, use a 3-part inventory form where one copy is left with the guest, another is sent to the front
     desk to update the folio, and the third is used to update the storeroom files.

3.11. Long Distance Telephone Calls. Charges for long distance telephone calls must be continuously
monitored. Lodging personnel must manually post charges to the guest's folio as calls are made, if the
telephone system does not interface with the property management system, and automatically update
folios. Guests will not be charged for local calls.

3.12. Forms Prescribed .
     3.12.1. AF Form 2506, Reservation for Individuals
     3.12.2. AF Form 2507, Reservation for Groups

located within North America between Canada and Mexico.
Corporate Lodging—Lodging obtained in the private sector at a rate lower than the normal commercial

lodging will result in monetary savings to the Air Force compared to the rates agreed to in MOUs, etc.,
already in effect.
Diversion—Temporary use of government facilities for other than designated use or rooms blocked for
maintenance. Does not change category code on real property inventory.
Essential Products Program (EPP)—The EPP is designed to maximize Air Force leverage in the

Force Services community for the negotiated period of time.
Family Member—The sponsor's (a) spouse; (b) unmarried child who is the sponsor's by birth, legal

                                AIR FORCE LODGING STANDARDS

A3.1. The overall objective of the Air Force lodging program is to support the Air Force mission by pro-
viding AF personnel and other authorized patrons quality lodging quarters similar to US mid-level, lim-
ited service commercial hotels/motels. The tables on the following pages are the standards that will
provide consistent quality and standardized facilities and service. Standards listed in Table A3.1. will not
be reduced or exceeded without a MAJCOM/SV waiver. General managers may request waivers to stan-
dards for extenuating circumstances; for example, room size does not allow adherence. The vast majority
of these products can be purchased through the Commanders’ Smart Buy and Essential Products Program
contracts the Air Force Nonappropriated Fund Purchasing Office established. For more information, visit
NAF Purchasing at www.afsv.af.mil, or contact your local Resource Management Flight Chief. The
required quantities (space permitting) are based on the minimum square footage authorized in Table 2.1.;
quantities can be adjusted to meet the actual space on hand. DVQs include both officer and enlisted DV
quarters. New construction (and renovation) of visiting quarters will ensure a private room/private bath
configuration for all grades and must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

   A4.3.1. Lodging management makes lodging reservations for RC personnel for on-base and with
   contract commercial lodging establishments in accordance with established procedures.
   A4.3.2. Non-availability numbers will not be issued to unit-assigned RC members in an inactive duty
   status.
   A4.3.3. Each ARC wing/unit will appoint a wing/unit lodging point of contact (POC). The POC is
   responsible for working all wing/unit lodging requirements with the host base lodging management
   and CL establishments when used. The ARC lodging POC at each installation will provide lodging a
   copy of the non-commute alpha roster, extracted from the Personnel Data System, which identifies
   members that are authorized lodging at unit expense during a Unit Training Assembly (UTA) week-
   end, rescheduled UTA (RUTA), additional flying training period (AFTP), annual tour (if applicable),
   etc. Lodging should load the non-commute listings in their lodging automated management system
   (Frequent Visitor File) to expedite the room assignment process.
   A4.3.4. The ARC wing/unit lodging POC at each installation will also provide lodging a copy of their
   annual UTA schedule as soon as it is finalized and approved (Jul-Sep time frame). Lodging will match
   the UTA schedule against their known reservations for the next fiscal year, compare against other
   commitments, and notify the ARC lodging representative of any problem time periods. Lodging will
   use this schedule to create a group reservation for scheduled UTAs. Lodging will notify the ARC POC
   of any problems in obtaining the required number of spaces. This allows the ARC commanders to
   reschedule UTAs or, if necessary, lodging to establish requirements-type contracts for specific time
   periods.
   A4.3.5. Within 5 working days after the UTA, the ARC wing/units will provide lodging a list identi-
   fying reserve or guard members who will require lodging for the next UTA. Lodging will input names
   and obtain CL, when needed, within 5 working days from receipt of the UTA lodging list. Three days
   prior to the scheduled UTA, the wing/unit POC will update the list (revalidate), in writing, with any
   changes that may have occurred. Changes that occur after this notification will be worked on a
   case-by-case basis with the host lodging activity.

NOTE: The ARC wing/unit guarantees payment for on-base and CL reserved for their members. The
wing/unit will be responsible for payment of quarters reserved and not used. Lodging will check in all unit
no-shows before the Friday night audit and provide a list of no-shows to the wing/unit lodging POC by
0800 on Saturday. The wing/unit will notify lodging by check-out time on Saturday if the member will
occupy quarters on Saturday night. Lodging will verify no-shows in the lodging automated management
system. The wing/unit will pay for no-shows at contract quarters also. Each ARC wing/unit must establish
and enforce a no-show policy to eliminate the expenditure of funds for unused rooms and to maintain
maximum utilization of on-base quarters.
     A4.3.6. Individual AFRC (IMA/IRR) personnel. Lodging is authorized for individual members who
     reside outside the commuting distance (50 miles, or 1-hour driving time).
     A4.3.7. IMA/IRR members may be given a non-availability number if on-base or contract lodging is
     not available. Reserve members must use government quarters for IDT lodging reimbursement. HQ
     AFRC/SVP corporate lodging contracts are in place for this purpose.

A4.4. Payment Responsibilities.
     A4.4.1. Procedures outlined herein apply to all Services unless otherwise noted.
     A4.4.2. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).
        A4.4.2.1. IMA/IRR Lodging Payment. Individual (IMA/IRR) members will pay all lodging
        charges regardless of the type of duty status (active duty or inactive duty for training), location
        where the duty is performed or per diem status, and file for reimbursement.
        A4.4.2.2. Unit-assigned members performing active duty tours (AF Form 938, Request and
        Authorization For Active Duty Training/Active Duty Tour), regardless of per diem status, are
        individually responsible for their lodging charges. Individuals will file for reimbursement.
        A4.4.2.3. Unit-assigned members performing IDTs away from home station (AF Form 40A,
        Record of Individual Inactive Duty Training) are responsible for payment of their lodging
        charges and will file for reimbursement. If a member shows up without an AF Form 40A for a
        rescheduled UTA, they must guarantee payment at check-in until lodging is provided an AF Form
        40A, or locally developed Reserve lodging form.
        A4.4.2.4. Unit-assigned members performing IDTs at home station will not pay lodging room
        charges. Lodging room costs (on-base and contract) for unit-assigned members performing IDTs
        at home station will be paid via a government travel account or IMPAC. Payment for personal
        charges, e.g., telephone, in-room resale items, late check out fees, etc., is the responsibility of the
        member. Individuals may not file for reimbursement for these charges.
     A4.4.3. Air National Guard.
        A4.4.3.1. Unit-assigned ANG members performing active duty tours, regardless of per diem sta-
        tus, are individually responsible for their lodging charges.
        A4.4.3.2. ANG members performing IDTs, regardless of location, will not pay for their lodging
        room costs. The unit of assignment will pay for on-base and contract quarters via an organiza-
        tional travel account (e.g., IMPAC). Payment for personal charges, e.g. telephone, in-room resale
        items, late check out fees, etc., is the responsibility of the member.
AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                    57


NOTE: For unit-assigned members, the ARC wing/unit provides lodging and/or CL managers with an
ARC lodging monitor(s), i.e. a wing/unit lodging POC or designated representative, if requested by the
servicing lodging or CL manager. This individual will be available in the reception area(s) on training
weekends to assist with peak check-in (and check-out) periods for unit-assigned members, and to facili-
tate resolution of UTA lodging issues.

A4.5. Billing Procedures.
   A4.5.1. For overseas deployments, the unit of assignment’s FM function may provide an AF Form
   616, Fund Cite Authorization (FCA), or other fund source document, to confirm that sufficient
   funds are available to cover the cost of contract quarters for unit-assigned personnel, if requested by
   the overseas general manager. (An AF Form 616 may also be provided, if requested, for on-base quar-
   ters for large deployments. This process will be accomplished within 20 working days following the
   deployment.)
   A4.5.2. For on-base lodging bills, the base lodging accounting technician will ensure that all back-up
   documentation (AF Form 938, AF Form 40A, or unit lodging reservation/revalidation listing, plus all
   folios) to substantiate the charges are provided with each bill. This portion of the process will be
   accomplished within 5 working days of the UTA. The ARC lodging POC, together with the lodging
   accounting technician, will review the bills and ensure they are correct and valid. Upon validation, the
   IMPAC or an organizational, centrally billed account is used to make payment. If discrepancies occur,
   lodging and the ARC lodging POC will work together to resolve the issue. This entire process will be
   accomplished within 20 working days from the UTA.
NOTE: At least twice monthly, lodging prepares bills for other IDT lodging requirements, e.g. RUTAs,
AFTPs, etc. Payment for these requirements is made via the IMPAC or other government travel account.
   A4.5.3. For CL bills, the CL establishments send the bills to the organization that made the reserva-
   tion, e.g. lodging, reserve or guard organization. Within 20 days of receipt, the RC lodging POC will
   validate the bill with lodging and pay the CL.
   A4.5.4. When a unit-assigned RC member performs an IDT at home station, in conjunction with an
   active duty tour, to include annual tour in a non per diem status, only the IDT portion is authorized for
   payment by the unit of assignment. The member is responsible for payment of their lodging charges
   for all active duty tours regardless of per diem status.
   A4.5.5. When a unit-assigned NG member pulls an IDT in conjunction with a per diem status tour,
   only the IDT portion is authorized payment by the unit of assignment. It is the responsibility of the
   member to present the paperwork for the IDT portion of the stay at check-in. The NG member is
   responsible for payment of their lodging charges when in a per diem status.
NOTE: For ANG situations that deviate from these procedures, contact the Air National Guard, Services
Branch (ANG/SVX), 3500 Fetchet Avenue, Andrews AFB MD 20762-5157, DSN 278-8166/77 prior to
implementation. For AFRC situations, both IMA/IRR and unit-assigned, that deviate from these proce-
dures, contact Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command, Directorate of Services, Programs Division
(HQ AFRC/SVP), 255 Second Street, Robins AFB GA 31098-1637, DSN 497-2103, prior to implemen-
tation.

This information has been extracted in part from the Housekeeping section of Performance Plus, the
training program developed by the Educational Institute of the American Hotel & Motel Association.

A5.1. Labor Productivity. To determine your average labor productivity (average output per individual
worker per year) divide the number of employees by the average daily rooms sold (Table A5.1.). For
example, in 1994 there were 40 employees to clean 284 rooms (71% occupancy). So, there were .14 per-
sonnel employed per occupied room. Therefore, if you average past ratios and project your occupancy to
rise to 90% (or 360 rooms--see Table A5.3.) due to a mission change, you would multiply the labor pro-
ductivity ratio by the projected average daily rooms to get the number of employees you are projecting to
need (.12 x 360 = 43). (Note: For even more accuracy, break rooms down by type and employees assigned
to that type. Figure the average labor productivity for each type room).

Replacement. Another management tool you may find useful is a replacement chart (Table A5.2.). You
can prepare a replacement chart for the entire operation or by workcenter. By using a replacement chart
you can more accurately forecast for turnover.

A5.2. Managing Productivity and Controlling Labor Costs. As indicated above, labor costs are the
largest controllable expense, management must constantly monitor labor schedules. If employees are
working more days or hours than necessary in proportion to the number of rooms occupied, the operation
will lose money. No hospitality operation can afford unproductive employees or wasted labor hours. For
example, assume your profits are 5% of the revenue generated by room and sundry sales. For every dollar
of sales made, lodging earns a profit of five cents. So, if we assume you have overscheduled/staffed
housekeeping and wasted $300 in unnecessary labor costs (for the week), to maintain a 5% profit level,
you must earn the $300 in lost profit by generating additional weekly sales of $6,000 ($300 divided by the
.05 profit requirement). Understaffing can be just as harmful because, in the long run, your employee
turnover will probably increase due to overwork/stress. Also, your business/profits may suffer as custom-
ers become dissatisfied with the quality of service and cleanliness of their room. The few housekeepers
remaining will be unable to meet the quality standards if they have too many rooms to clean!

A5.3. Productivity Standards. To determine productivity standards you must observe a number of
employees (who and how many depends on what department) and calculate the average time it takes them
to do their job (whatever you determine the standard will come from). For instance, in housekeeping, you
might observe 6 housekeepers cleaning rooms during their shift. You determine the average cleaning time
(to meet quality performance standards) is 30 minutes. Next, determine the length of their shift and time
available to clean rooms (see steps 2 and 3 – Table A5.3.). To obtain your productivity standard you
divide the result of step 3 by the result of step 1. In this case each housekeeper can be expected to clean 14
(check-out) rooms per shift. The next step is to determine how many employees you project to need based
on this figure and your projected room occupancy. Additionally, the automated system provides average
number of daily and yearly check-outs/stay-overs (under the Manager Reports screens) to aid in employee
management and planning.

 Determine the productivity standard by dividing 30 Minutes Per 8-Hour Shift
the result of Step 3 by the result of Step 1.    420 Minutes = 21 Guestrooms (Stay-Over)

**See AFMAN 34-310, NAF Personnel Program Management and Administration Procedures, for
guidance pertaining to breaks/meals, etc., for NAF employees.

To fine-tune your operation and management, you might consider developing one of these charts for each
type of quarters you manage.

A5.4. Employee Requirements Planning. Although we focus on housekeeping staffing in these exam-
ples, don’t forget the principle applies to all departments. Staffing guides will help you schedule the cor-
rect number of employees and ensure labor expenses remain within your operating budget. We must take
into account our full-time and flex employees. Generally, it is advisable to schedule full-time employees
to the minimum allowed hours and use flex employees to make up the difference. In the housekeeping
department, the number of room attendants, housepersons, and inspectors needed depends primarily on
the number of rooms occupied during the previous night and the amount of reservations and projected
walk-ins. You can take a staffing guide as far as necessary to help manage your personnel and operation.
In addition, if the budgeted department labor expense is based on the same productivity standards as the
staffing guide, the supervisor is assured of keeping labor costs in line with management’s expectations.

First, (for housekeepers) calculate labor hours needed by multiplying your productivity standard by your
occupied rooms (e.g., at 80% occupancy, .5 x 320 = 160 hours needed to clean 320 rooms). Next, you
must determine how many housekeepers it will take to clean 320 rooms (within the 160 labor hours).
Divide the number of occupied rooms by the number of rooms one housekeeper can clean during their
shift (e.g., 320 divided by 14 = 23 room attendants). You could also mix full-time and flex, as long as you

come up with the same required labor hours. As the purpose of accurate scheduling is not just to make
sure you schedule enough people to get your rooms clean, but also to ensure your labor costs are under
control, you must now figure what your labor expenses will be. Calculate labor expenses by multiplying
the total labor hours by the average hourly rate for room attendants (e.g., 160 x $5.50 = $880). Continue
to project in all departments to get your projected total labor hours and expense (e.g., at 80% occupancy
you will need 244 total labor hours @ $1,381 to take care of all labor associated with 320 occupied
rooms). (Note: You can complete a variable staffing guide for any category of employee. It is also helpful
to break the table out by activity; i.e., one for housekeeping and one for housepersons, etc. To enhance
your control of expenses even further, you can also use this chart to add in extra labor expenses such as
401k.)
     A5.4.1. However, it doesn’t matter how accurate your staffing guide is if you don’t make accurate (as
     possible) occupancy predictions. It is very helpful to develop occupancy forecasts for 3 days, 2 weeks,
     and each month. You can then use these forecasts to develop your employees’ schedules. Use 2-week
     and 3-day forecasts to more accurately hone projected schedules.
        A5.4.1.1. Even when you project well and update schedules, you cannot avoid some variances in
        occupancy. In the military, we are very aware of unexpected events. Because of this, it is very
        important you understand how to control labor costs. For instance, when more guests than pro-
        jected show up, your employees’ productivity will increase. They will clean more rooms faster
        than usual because they must to meet the demand. Conversely, when business volume is lower
        than forecasted, productivity decreases. This is due to overstaffing, since there are now more peo-
        ple than necessary to clean the rooms. Either condition is not good management practice and can
        have a negative financial effect.
        A5.4.1.2. IAW AFMAN 34-310, all employees must have access to a posted schedule. Flexible
        employees may be subject to “on call” work in addition to hours posted on the schedule. Work
        schedules may be changed by supervisors/managers by providing the employee a minimum of 24
        hours notice. Locally devised work schedule forms are authorized to post work schedules. Also,
        changes in the work schedule that do not decrease an employee’s guaranteed hours may be made
        with a minimum 24-hour notice.
        A5.4.1.3. The tour of duty is established, in writing, for all regular employees at least one admin-
        istrative workweek in advance of the tour to be worked and should not be changed or adjusted
        solely to avoid the payment of premium pay or other benefits. If possible, establish the tour of duty
        for the same days of each week, for the same hours each day, and on consecutive days of the
        administrative workweek.
        A5.4.1.4. Post days off, vacation time, and requested days off as far in advance as possible for all
        employees. Note all schedule changes directly on the posted work schedule. A very visible way to
        determine if your scheduling practices are deficient is to look at your unscheduled overtime costs.
        Sporadic unscheduled overtime may be nothing to worry about, but consistent unscheduled over-
        time should always be thoroughly investigated and steps taken to eliminate the problem.

A5.5. Employee Turnover. One responsibility of being a manager/supervisor is the ability to compre-
hensively predict the level of employee turnover. As in any prediction, we must look at historical data, the
current situation, and future changes. These facts can be translated into a trend analysis you can use to
forecast future employment and personnel demands. Changing area demographics, high permanent
AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                     63


change of station, and changing Air Force policies are some of the events that determine turnover and
demand for new employees.
   A5.5.1. What is turnover and why should it concern you? Turnover is the replacement cycle that
   occurs each time a position is vacated and you must hire, outfit, and train a new employee. Therefore,
   it usually translates into a loss of money. Within the last few years, the supply of available workers has
   decreased. We share the lack of available workforce with the civilian industry. Another problem we
   share is the nature of service-type jobs. Traditionally, these jobs are temporary or “stepping stones” to
   a permanent job. Rarely, especially in housekeeping, does an employee consider making the service
   industry a lifetime or career choice. Because of this (and many other reasons such as poor training,
   low pay, and lack of benefits), turnover in hospitality is very high. Turnover results in a constant loss
   of experienced personnel in areas critical to a successful operation.
       A5.5.1.1. When you have employee turnover, many behind-the-scene reactions occur. With each
       turnover you will incur the cost of advertising, interviewing, hiring, training, and outfitting a new
       employee. You may also incur turnover costs in intangible ways such as decreased guest satisfac-
       tion caused by new employee mistakes or performing slower as they learn. If guest satisfaction
       suffers too much you may lose business and money. Employees may also become frustrated, for
       numerous reasons, and quit. Understanding probable employee turnover causes can help you con-
       trol turnover problems.
       A5.5.1.2. To help manage your workforce, costs, and business, it is easy to calculate your turn-
       over rate for any time period or worker. For instance, it usually takes at least 1 year for a manager
       to become fully competent in their position; a head housekeeper usually takes 5 months. The costs
       of replacing these employees have far-reaching effects. Calculating turnover rates can help you
       prepare to meet the mission with a reduced workforce.
       A5.5.1.3. Calculating turnover rate. Begin by dividing the number of terminations during a
       time period by the average number of personnel employed for that period. An easy way to figure
       the average number of personnel is to add the number employed at the beginning of the period to
       the number employed at the end and divide by 2. Multiply the result by 100, since the rate is usu-
       ally expressed as a percentage. This calculation will include your desirable and undesirable turn-
       over. Is turnover ever desirable? Sure, it can be, if, the employee’s productivity is not worth the
       cost of retaining.
       A5.5.1.4. It is not enough to simply understand that turnover occurs, you must also take steps to
       prevent it from happening when it is not desired. If an employee chooses to leave, the best way to
       find out why is to ask them. They could be leaving because they are dissatisfied with pay, benefits,
       training, management, promotion/advancement opportunities, or moving. Usually, if an impartial
       individual conducts an interview with a departing employee they can determine the reasons for
       departure. This information may help improve your program.
       A5.5.1.5. Developing effective recruiting and orientation programs that are culturally sensitive,
       and meet lodging’s needs, can help reduce unnecessary turnover. It is extremely important to take
       interviews seriously to avoid the turnover cycle. Look at programs in the long-term and develop
       socialization/orientation and training programs in employees’ language. An active recognition and
       incentive program also provides increased motivation by showing management concern and
       involvement.

     A5.5.1.6. Whether discipline results in turnover (i.e., firing an employee for substandard perfor-
     mance) or identification and correction of behavior, managers must lay the groundwork through
     documentation of actions and behavior for effective discipline. If all instances of behavior where
     discipline is appropriate are not documented, it becomes very detrimental to the lodging operation.
     Establish reasonable and well-understood rules and make sure everyone knows the rules and con-
     sequences. Concentrate on what is good about the performance, not just what is wrong. Ensure
     undesirable behavior is permanently eliminated, not only during disciplinary action. Avoid plac-
     ing managers and employees in adversarial positions and enforce all rules with fairness and impar-
     tiality.
     A5.5.1.7. When analyzing trends, identify occupancy rates because they help determine how
     many employees you need and how the occupancy rate correlates to the number of personnel
     employed. How do you do this? Take a look at Table A5.1. The 1995 through 1998 information
     was derived from historical data. The 1999 data was projected based on past occupancy figures
     (Priority 1 and 2 guest totals), past numbers of personnel employed at those levels, level of service
     provided at those times (customer satisfaction/ability to meet standards), current trends, projected
     mission changes, and renovation and construction projects.

                                        AIRCREW SUPPORT

A6.1. Aircrew Support Programs.
   A6.1.1. Special aircrew handling programs, such as Prime Knight, ensure high-quality and consistent
   lodging, transportation, and food service support to transient aircrews. The quality of service depends
   upon timely notification to the host program manager of aircrew requirements. The program is man-
   datory for all transient aircrews.
   A6.1.2. The elements of success for aircrew handling programs include commander interest and
   involvement, aircrew awareness, MAJCOM procedures to facilitate timely requests for service, and
   customer-oriented, base-level agencies.
   A6.1.3. The installation commander appoints a program manager empowered with the authority to
   ensure transient aircrews receive transportation, lodging, and food service support.

A6.2. Functional Responsibilities.
   A6.2.1. HQ USAF/ILV . Serves as the Air Staff office of primary responsibility (OPR), reviews pro-
   gram assessments and MAJCOM reports (upon request), and in coordination with other Air Staff
   agencies such as Operations (XOO) and Transportation (ILTT) provides recommendations to the Air
   Force Chief of Staff.
   A6.2.2. MAJCOM/SVs will:
       A6.2.2.1. Coordinate MAJCOM staff guidance with other agencies (XO, LGT, etc.)
       A6.2.2.2. Implement the program command-wide. NOTE: These programs do not apply to bases
       that do not support flight operations.
       A6.2.2.3. Conduct periodic assessments of the program.
   A6.2.3. Host installation commanders will:
       A6.2.3.1. Implement this instruction and approve local support plans and procedures.
       A6.2.3.2. Appoint a base program manager. NOTE: This program impacts several disciplines;
       e.g., Services, Transportation. No single, functional entity is responsible for providing all the
       required services under this program. Therefore, the vehicle operations chief, lodging general
       manager, or food service officer will not be appointed as the Prime Knight manager. Select this
       individual from an operations unit such as operations support, Air Mobility support, or command
       post.
       A6.2.3.3. Provide the resources required for a viable Prime Knight program.
   A6.2.4. Aircraft commanders/command and control agencies (or other MAJCOM designated
   agencies) will:
       A6.2.4.1. At the earliest opportunity, provide destination program managers with information
       required as indicated below:
          A6.2.4.1.1. Using a fax, telephone, message, or radio (HF), provide number of crew members
          by rank (e.g., 5 officers, 3 enlisted, estimated time of arrival (ETA), gender of crew by excep-
66                                                    AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003


           tion, and call sign/tail number if available). Upon arrival at the TDY location, the aircraft com-
           mander provides a copy of the aircrew orders listing each member’s SSAN to the program
           representative.
           A6.2.4.1.2. Cancel reservations to preclude “no shows” and guaranteed hold charges being
           assessed due to mission changes, weather diversions, etc.
     A6.2.5. Base Program Manager will:
        A6.2.5.1. Develop base aircrew handling program support plans and policies to provide transient
        aircrew with transportation, lodging, and access to meals.
        A6.2.5.2. Ensure a responsible individual meets each transient aircraft requesting Prime Knight
        service and provides appropriate transportation, keys, (or documentation) for lodging/rooms, and
        an information packet to the Aircraft Commander. (NOTE: The vehicle operator may be used for
        this task.) Installations may set policy allowing the crews to pick up the information packet and
        keys at the command post or base operations if crews normally stop at these locations prior to
        going into crew rest. Under no circumstances will aircrews be required to pick up keys or other
        items from locations they would not normally transit (not applicable during contingency aircraft
        operations).
        A6.2.5.3. Ensure the welcome packet contains the following as a minimum:
           A6.2.5.3.1. Base information on meals, lodging, and transportation, lodging registration
           forms, or off-base lodging authorizations.
           A6.2.5.3.2. Program critique form.
        A6.2.5.4. The lodging general manager will support the installation Prime Knight manager by
        providing adequate rooms and efficient lodging guest service to transient aircrews when rooms are
        available. Further, the general manager will:
           A6.2.5.4.1. Establish designated aircrew visiting quarters when the volume of transient air-
           crews warrants.
           A6.2.5.4.2. Provide reservation capability during all normal operating hours (e.g. at 24-hour
           lodging operations, aircrews should be able to make reservations at any time during that
           period).
           A6.2.5.4.3. Pre-register the aircrew if assigned to on-base lodging. In addition, the general
           manager will block or assign rooms and assemble keys or put them in the information packet
           prior to the aircrew’s arrival. (On base lodging will be used to the maximum extent possible to
           maximize mission execution and limit demand on support activities)
           A6.2.5.4.4. Information packets will contain base information meals, lodging, and transporta-
           tion; lodging registration forms or off-base (commercial lodging) authorizations if necessary;
           area maps; and customer comment cards.
           A6.2.5.4.5. Assemble the necessary documents if the aircrew is staying off base (CL authori-
           zations, directions to CL, etc.)
           A6.2.5.4.6. Establish an express check-out system for aircrews staying in government quar-
           ters.
AFI34-246_ANGSUP1_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                 67


         A6.2.5.4.7. Assign each crew member to a single room (exceptions may be made during con-
         tingencies). Aircrew members are defined as anyone on the flight crew order. Ensure gender is
         considered when assigned lodging to aircrews. Crew integrity will be maintained--all mem-
         bers of the same crew will be housed together, either all on base or all off base. If a crew is
         divided into multiple buildings on base, no more than two stops will be required to pick up all
         crew members.
  A6.2.6. Food Service will:
     A6.2.6.1. Provide the program manager with menus and operating hours of the flight kitchen and
     base appropriated fund dining facilities for inclusion in the aircrew information package.
     A6.2.6.2. Respond to aircrew requests for meals. (Use of the in-flight kitchen is sufficient to meet
     this requirement.)
  A6.2.7. Transportation will:
     A6.2.7.1. Meet the aircraft within 10 minutes of the time requested by the aircrew or applicable
     command and control system.
     A6.2.7.2. Provide authorized transportation to aircrew members during their stay. NOTE: Base
     shuttle or taxi services are considered adequate and may be used for this purpose but will not be
     used for initial pickups or departures.
     A6.2.7.3. Respond to the aircrew’s request for departure pickup at the established pickup time.
  A6.2.8. Base operations (or command post) will:
     A6.2.8.1. Track all inbound aircraft in the normal course of duties that might generate program
     requirements. If there is a change to either arrival time or number of crew members expected, base
     operations or command post personnel will notify the responsible agency/agencies as indicated in
     the installation program support plan. Base operations will provide these updates as soon as possi-
     ble but not later than 1 hour, if possible, prior to scheduled arrival times.
