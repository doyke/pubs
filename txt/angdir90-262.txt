This new directive implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-2, Inspector General --The
Inspection System, and is applicable to all Air National Guard (ANG) Security Forces
Squadrons. This C&SRL is based on Air Force Instruction (AFI) 31-401, Information Security
Program Management, AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, and AFI 31-601,
Industrial Security Program Management. Units may supplement this directory to add internal
compliance items. This directive may be used in whole or in part by Higher Headquarters
(HHQ) during visits or exercises. Higher Headquarters/Inspector General (HHQ/IG) will use
this directive in whole or in part during evaluations and exercises. Users may add any item(s),
which, in the exercise of good judgment, requires examination. Refer recommended changes
and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field
through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air
Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims.

1. General
   1.1. Compliance and Standardization Requirements Lists (C&SRL) are the primary lists
   used during a MAJCOM conducted Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI) to access unit
   compliance with established guidance. Items set forth in this C&SRL are based upon
   existing “by-law” requirements, Department of Defense (DoD) directives, AF and ANG
2            AIR NATIONAL GUARD POLICY DIRECTIVE90-262 25 FEBRUARY 2010


    guidance, NGB-JA, MAJCOM ANG assistants, and mission areas deemed critical by AF or
    ANG leadership to assessing and assuring unit organizational health and/or performance.
    The objective of the C&SRL is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required
    capabilities of ANG SF Units.
    1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCOs) represent the highest priority of inspection
    items and are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCAs)
    and the thirteen missions areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower
    tier Core and General Compliance Items may be stand alone or subordinate to a CCO.
    During the UCI, it is the expected intent of the MAJCOM IG to inspect, at a minimum, 100
    percent of the CCOs that apply to the inspected unit. However, the items listed do not
    constitute the order or limit the scope of the Inspection / assessment. The objective is to
    identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities. Units should ensure
    validation of each compliance item with supporting documentation. Critical, core, and
    general compliance criteria are defined as follows:
       1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). An item or area that represent “single-
       point failure” issues where non-compliance would result in direct mission impact or
       could very likely result in loss of life, serious injury, or significant potential for litigation.
       CCOs are shown in bold and identified as “CCO” under the item’s section number.
       1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). An item or area that requires special vigilance and
       is important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed “critical.” Non-
       compliance would result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result
       in injury or possible litigation. CCIs are identified as “CCI” under the item’s section
       number.
       1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). An item or area deemed fundamental to
       successful overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result only in
       minimal impact on mission accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or
       possible litigation. GCIs are identified as “GCI” under the item’s section number.
