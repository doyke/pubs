AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                             7


     includes access to archived e-mail files, organizational shared drives, restricted-access
     web sites, and other sources of information. Commanders will ensure history offices are
     equipped or have access to dedicated secure (SIPRNET) and unclassified (NIPRNET)
     network computer terminals. Additionally, Government Services Agency (GSA)-
     approved security containers must be available in the workplace for the storage of
     classified information.
        1.4.1.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Historians at the Air Force Life Cycle Management
        Center (AFLCMC), Wright-Patterson AFB, OH; Air Force Test Center (AFTC),
        Edwards AFB, CA; Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC), Tinker AFB, OK; Air
        Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC), Kirtland AFB, NM; and, Air Force
        Research Laboratory (a Center-level organization), Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, will
        continue to produce annual histories in accordance with AFI84-101. Historians will
        also be on the staffs of Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC), Arnold
        AFB, TN; 75th Air Base Wing (ABW), Hill AFB, UT; 78th ABW, Robins AFB, GA;
        96th Test Wing (TW), Eglin AFB, FL; 66 Air Base Group (ABG), Hanscom AFB,
        MA; AFRL/RVIH (Phillips Research Site), Kirtland AFB, NM; and, AF Office of
        Scientific Research (AFOSR), Arlington, VA. The historians located at the 75 ABW
        and 78 ABW will document the history of the Ogden Air Logistics Complex (OO-
        ALC) and Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex (WR-ALC) respectively. These
        historians will be given access to all required Complex information as described in
        AFI84-101, 1.4.1.1. The 66 ABG historian will document the history of AFLCMC
        activities at Hanscom AFB. The AFRL/RVIH historian will document the history of
        AFRL activities at Kirtland AFB. The 96 TW historian will document the history of
        AFTC activities at Eglin AFB. These historians will be given access to all required
        information at their respective AFB as described in AFI84-101. All field historians
        will have authority to directly task, work, and coordinate with those organizations
        whose activity they are required to document without having to work through
        administrative headquarters such as wings or groups. Historians of a subordinate unit
        will support, as possible, another Center with units at that location that does not have
        a historian.
            1.4.1.1.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Each History Office at the Centers and AFRL will
            produce a comprehensive annual history report, which will include narrative,
            chronology entries, supporting documentation, and appendices documentation
            provided by their respective subordinate history offices. Center historians will
            develop production plans for each periodic history, to include identifying
            responsibilities and production assignments for historians at the Center’s
            subordinate units. Center historians should have direct access to respective field
            historians, as necessary, during preparation of a periodic history, development of
            a response to a historical inquiry, or coordination of historical research and
            writing.
     1.4.1.2. Ensure their historians have adequate office space and resources necessary to
     maintain and protect historical documents, to research paper and electronic files (software
     and hardware), to provide research assistance to the staff, and to attend Air Force history
     conferences and symposiums.

        1.4.1.3. Participate in periodic interviews with the historian (at least once annually) so
        that the historian can capture the commander’s perspective on issues of historical
        significance. Also participate in an end-of-tour interview.
        1.4.1.4. Review and sign the unit history within 30 days of submission of the final draft
        to the command section.
        1.4.1.5. Ensure their historians are not assigned additional duties, such as protocol,
        public affairs, building custodian, unit deployment manager, or special event project
        officer that interfere with their primary duty, which is maintaining a current periodic
        history report.
1.5. Field Organizations. As discussed in the following subsections, establishments and units
throughout the Air Force perform history functions consistent with AFI 38-101, Air Force
Organization. They also document their significant activities in periodic histories. NOTE:
From this point on, all lists of duties and responsibilities are arranged in order of importance.
     1.5.1. Major Commands (MAJCOM) and Other Organizations. A function of Air Force
     command is to document an organization’s significant activities. Each MAJCOM
     headquarters, wing, center, laboratory, and comparable organization establishes and
     maintains a history office (HO) as a separate staff agency consistent with the standards
     established by AFI 38-101, paragraph 3.3.2. These agencies will be staffed by qualified
     personnel who report directly to the command section (commander, vice commander, or
     director of staff). For the purpose of this instruction, the Air National Guard (ANG)
     headquarters’ history office performs as a MAJCOM history office.
     1.5.2. MAJCOM/HOs:
        1.5.2.1. Monitor the status of the subordinate unit history programs. Conduct on-site
        assessments at least once every two years.

        heritage personnel.
        1.5.2.3. Plan for involvement of MAJCOM and subordinate organizations’ historians in
        wartime and contingency operations. See AFI 84-102, Historical Operations in
        Contingency and War, for mobility readiness training requirements.
        1.5.2.4. Monitor all AEF deployable historians’ preparation and availability for
        contingency/wartime operations.
        1.5.2.5. Monitor and report non-compliance with Top Secret clearance requirements to
        the appropriate authorities. See paragraph 1.6.9.
        1.5.2.6. Serve as members of their respective Inspector General team and conduct
        inspections of their subordinate history offices.
        1.5.2.7. Provide continuation training to personnel assigned at subordinate organization
        history offices through biennial workshops.
        1.5.2.8. Coordinate with the History and Museums Civilian Career Field Management
        Team to schedule applicable training and education for historians.
AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                                9

   1.5.3. Numbered Air Forces (NAF), Independent Groups, Squadrons reporting directly to
   MAJCOM, and comparable organizations. MAJCOM/HOs establish requirements and
   procedures for historical services and documentation at these organizations. In conjunction
   with MAJCOM manpower officials, MAJCOM/HOs will determine if these organizations
   need full-time historians assigned. If required, submit requests through manpower channels
   as described in Air Force Manpower Standard 101A following coordination with the Air
   Force History and Museums Policies and Programs (AFHMP) Career Field Manager.
   1.5.4. Direct Reporting Units (DRU) and Field Operating Agencies (FOA) reporting directly
   to Headquarters USAF:
       1.5.4.1. DRUs and FOAs establish and maintain history offices as separate, special staff
       agencies with qualified personnel who have direct access to commanders or directors.
       1.5.4.2. A DRU or FOA may, if circumstances warrant, establish procedures to collect
       historical information from, for example, geographically-separated subordinate
       organizations.
       1.5.4.3. FOAs without full time historians will appoint additional duty historians. Send
       names, office addresses, and phone numbers of these individuals to AF/HO which will
       establish reporting guidelines.
1.6. Air Force Historians (All Levels):
   1.6.1. Produce substantive periodic history reports, which are the foundation of the AFHMP.
   Timely submission of these reports is the historian’s primary responsibility.
   1.6.2. Provide historical services that meet the needs of the unit’s commanders and staffs.

   of the organization’s periodic histories and provide an updated listing of these holdings to the
   AFHRA every two years.
       1.6.3.1. (Added-AFMC) All AFMC historians will establish and maintain an account
       with the Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA) for access to the Inferential
       Retrieval and Indexing System (IRIS).
   1.6.4. Answer other historical questions and queries.
       1.6.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Use AFMC Form 281, Historical Information Services
       Request, or equivalent locally-designed form, to record data on reference requests
       received. Automated collection of statistical data on numbers and types of requests and
       utility of information provided is encouraged. Maintain a log of Freedom of Information
       Act (FOIA) requests and retain FOIA paperwork with relevant archive reference material.

                     HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS AND SERVICES

Section 2A—Periodic Histories

2.1. Purpose of Air Force History. Air Force historical products provide objective, accurate,
descriptive, and interpretive records of Air Force operations in peace and war. By recounting
lessons learned, Air Force history enables our nations’ military and civilian leaders to approach
current problems and concerns more intelligently and professionally. Evaluation of past
experience is of great value to planners and decision- makers in determining current policies and
preparing for current and future contingencies. Knowledge of history is a significant factor in
determining the success or failure of a particular policy, plan, or operation. Accurate and timely
historical reporting provides decision-makers with information they can use to improve the
combat capability of the United States Air Force and the Department of Defense.
   2.1.1. Products. The primary product of Air Force unit historians is the periodic history
   report. Historians also prepare various types of publications, papers, and other products that
   often contain classified information. These products:
       2.1.1.1. Preserve an official record of Air Force operations.
       2.1.1.2. Make information available to decision-makers and action officers.
       2.1.1.3. Provide reference material for researchers.
       2.1.1.4. Promote awareness of Air Force heritage.
       2.1.1.5. Support professional military education.
   2.1.2. Periodic history reports will be produced, preserved, and distributed electronically.
   Exceptions to this policy must be coordinated with the parent MAJCOM historian or
   equivalent. Other historical products may be distributed electronically or in paper. Only
   standard Air Force licensed software will be used to produce these products.
2.2. Periodic History Reports (RCS: HAF-HO(A)7101). The periodic history report
represents the official Air Force effort to preserve information in a complete and systemic
manner for future research and reference. These reports consist of a narrative account of
significant events supported by a collection of original source documents. Periodic history
reports serve as the institutional memory of Air Force organizations.
   2.2.1. Each organization with a full-time historian will prepare periodic history reports
   according to instructions in Chapter 3.
   2.2.2. Periodic History Reports (RCS: HAF-HO (A) 7101. The standard submission cycle
   for periodic history reports is 12-months. Organizations may use either calendar or fiscal
   year cycles. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs must advise AF/HO of the submission cycle
   selected for their command’s annual history report. MAJCOMs may specify reporting cycles
   for subordinate units and organizations.
       2.2.2.1. The history report must be submitted for signature by the commander, vice
       commander, or director of staff not later than the date indicated in Table 2.1 (30 April for
       fiscal year reports and 31 July for calendar year reports). The report is considered
 12                                                AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


       complete when signed; the table below indicates additional milestones in the history
       report production process.
       2.2.2.1. (AFMC) The Air Force Test Center (AFTC), Air Force Life Cycle
       Management Center (AFLCMC), Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) and AFRL
       annual history reports must be submitted for signature to the commander or vice
       commander not later than 30 June. The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC)
       annual history report must be submitted for signature to the commander or vice
       commander no later than 30 April. The National Museum of the United States Air Force
       (NMUSAF) history report must be submitted to the NMUSAF Director not later than 31
       July.
           2.2.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) The standard coverage period for AFMC Centers and

      AFHRA Snapshot                                    31 December
       2.2.2.2. The AFHRA will take a snapshot of history reports received as of 31 December
       each year and forward this summary to AF/HO and the MAJCOMs by 31 January.
   2.2.3. AF/HO may adjust the coverage period and due date of periodic history reports for
   MAJCOMs, DRUs, and FOAs. Requests for adjustments must be dated no later than 30 days
   prior to original due date and signed by the organization commander, vice commander, or
   director of staff.
       2.2.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Requests for extension of due dates, signed by the Center
       commander, vice commander or director of staff, must be received in HQ AFMC/HO at
       least 30 days prior to the established deadline. The extension request will provide
       detailed justification for the request and propose a realistic extension date. Extensions of
       more than 90 days are strongly discouraged.
   2.2.4. MAJCOM/HOs may adjust the coverage period and due date of subordinate unit
   reports based on command or individual needs. Requests for adjustments must be dated no
   later than 30 days prior to original due date and signed by the organization commander, vice
   commander, or director of staff. MAJCOM/HOs will issue automatic extensions for
   contingency-related and formal training TDYs and inform AF/HO of such changes.
   2.2.5. Issues-Based Historical Reports. While all Air Force historical reports are, by their
   very nature, “issues-based,” experienced Air Force historians may be authorized to submit
AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                               13


   “issues-based historical reports” that differ from the traditional report model in a number of
   significant ways.
       2.2.5.1. An issues-based historical report features an expanded and thoroughly-
       documented chronology, a narrative that provides detailed, analytical coverage of a
       narrower range of significant issues, appendices, and a collection of primary source
       documents. The purpose of an issues-based historical report is to provide select
       historians the opportunity to discuss fewer issues in greater depth, relegating routine
       matters to the chronology, appendices, and the supporting document collection.
       2.2.5.2. Historians determine the issues included in the issues-based history’s narrative in
       consultation with their commander and staff, plus additional guidance that may be
       provided by AF/HO or the appropriate MAJCOM.
       2.2.5.3. Only experienced Air Force historians who have demonstrated the ability to
       produce historical reports in a timely manner may be afforded the opportunity to use the
       issues-based model. AF/HO approves the use of the issued-based model for MAJCOMs,
       FOAs, and DRUs. MAJCOMs approve the use of the issued-based model for their
       subordinate units and organizations.

Section 2B—Heritage Pamphlets

2.3. Heritage Pamphlets. Unit members are the primary audience for these brief, unclassified
historical accounts of an organization. Submit the draft pamphlet to the MAJCOM/HO for
review prior to clearing the pamphlet through Public Affairs for security and policy review. The
pamphlet must be cleared through the security and policy review process for public distribution
or distribution to a non-military audience.
   2.3.1. Organizations with full-time historians prepare these pamphlets and post them on the
   unit’s website for widespread access.
   2.3.2. The heritage pamphlet normally consists of a narrative plus tables with key lineage,
   honors, and mission data. It should also include historically significant images highlighting
   mission accomplishment. Include a short history of the installation in the pamphlet of a base
   host unit.
   2.3.3. The pamphlet is a living document and must be updated electronically either annually
   or after major changes in mission, organization, leadership, or accomplishments. Ensure the
   pamphlet includes a “current as of” date. Print as needed.
   2.3.4. Provide an electronic copy of the heritage pamphlet to AFHRA/ACC.
       2.3.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Distribution of heritage pamphlets will also include all AFMC
       field history offices.

Section 2C—Historical Publications

2.4. Studies. Air Force historians at all levels research and write a variety of classified and
unclassified historical products, studying significant issues, policies, operations, programs,
developments, doctrine, procedures, or comparable topics. AF/HOH is the program’s clearing
house for all historical publications. Historians must submit topics to the Director, AF/HOH via
 14                                                AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


the parent MAJCOM/HO to obtain guidance and advice concerning editorial standards and other
issues.
   2.4.1. These products can vary widely in length and format depending on the topic covered
   and intended audience. In-depth narrative studies of significant topics must provide thorough
   source citations for the information presented and include many of the same features and
   components used in the preparation of periodic history reports (see Chapter 3). In some
   cases, extensive studies on topics of general interest may, if unclassified and cleared for
   public release, be published as books. In addition to lengthy and fully documented narrative
   examinations of a topic, historical studies can also take the form of chronologies, technical
   reports, statistical analyses, bibliographical essays, and annotated document collections.
   2.4.2. While the periodic history report remains the Air Force historian’s primary product,
   historians at wings, centers, and other subordinate organizations are encouraged to produce
   studies on topics within their units having potential long-range historical significance.
   Subordinate historians must coordinate proposed studies and final drafts with AF/HOH
   through their respective MAJCOM/HO. Historians at MAJCOM headquarters, FOAs, and
   DRUs will inform AF/HOH of products of potential Air Force-wide interest.
      2.4.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Historians will coordinate proposed topics and final drafts of
      studies with HQ AFMC/HO.
   2.4.3. Distribute final products as widely as legally possible, contingent on the subject and
   classification. MAJCOM/HOs must approve distribution outside of originating wings and
   centers. Send a final digital copy, complete with digital supporting documents, to AF/HOH
   and AFHRA/ACC. If a complete digital copy is not produced, send one paper copy complete
   with paper supporting documents. Do not mix digital and paper formats. The AFHRA will
   send studies and reports to the Air University Library as required by AFI 36-2303,
   Documents and Publications for AU Library, and other reference libraries and document
   repositories as appropriate. Submit studies on technical subjects to the Defense Technical
   Information Center (DTIC) in accordance with AFI 61-202, USAF Technical Publications
   Program. Before distribution or release to members of the public, submit final manuscripts
   to the appropriate Public Affairs office for security and policy review in accordance with AFI
   35-102, Security and Policy Review.
2.5. Interviews. Within the Air Force History and Museums Program, there are two types of
interviews.
   2.5.1. Air Force Oral History Program Interviews. This program captures the insights and
   perspectives of significant Air Force personnel via a formal process.
      2.5.1.1. Unit historians must coordinate proposed interviews with their respective
      MAJCOM/HO, which then forwards the proposal to AFHRA/OH, which in turn, requests
      approval from AF/HO. AF/HO is the final authority.
      2.5.1.2. If the individual providing the oral history is not currently an active duty military
      member or federal government civilian employee, the individual must assign rights to the
      oral history, in whatever format it is preserved, to the Air Force and be given a copy of
      the agreement (see Attachment 20) before the individual dictates his/her comments.
      Guard and Reserve personnel and foreign participants must also sign this form.
AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                                15


       2.5.1.3. All Oral Histories conducted by Air Force historians must contain the following
       statement on either the title page or the first page of the transcript:
           2.5.1.3.1. The opinions and facts expressed in this interview are those of the speaker.
           These comments have been transcribed as they were recorded during the interview.
           Unless otherwise noted, no attempt has been made to check or correct dates and other
           facts mentioned by the subject. The opinions are those of the subject and do not
           necessarily represent those of the United States Air Force or the Air Force History
           and Museums Program.
       2.5.1.4. Send transcripts and the audio, video, or digital recordings with bookmarks to
       AFHRA/ OH for the Air Force Oral History collection.
   2.5.2. Research Interviews. These interviews are in support of periodic history reports and
   other research. See paragraph 3.3.1.8.
2.6. Books. Historians usually publish these major projects through the Government Printing
Office or its designated office or representative only after a thorough review process and
professional editing. Contact AF/HOH to obtain the latest edition of the AF/HO Style Guide and
GPO Style Guide before proceeding. In some cases, field historians may publish books locally,
usually in cooperation with nonprofit organizations. Prior to initiating such projects, coordinate
proposals with AF/HOH via the parent MAJCOM/HO.
2.7. Articles, Book Reviews, and Papers. Members of the Air Force History and Museums
Program are encouraged to write articles, book reviews, and papers for Air Force and non-Air
Force publications. However, DoD recommends against the use of official titles when authoring
materials in a non-official capacity. Use of titles, such as Air Force historian, in these instances
implies Air Force endorsement of the product. Therefore, members of the AFHMP who publish
in non-DoD publications may not use official titles or assignment unless the work has been
vetted at the MAJCOM and HAF level. Submit material for security and policy review well in
advance of publication. Follow the instructions in AFI 35-102, Security and Policy Review.
2.8. Staff Papers. Use every opportunity to prepare background papers, point papers, talking
papers, and similar products on historical topics of interest to senior leadership. For formats, see
AF Handbook (AFH) 33-337, The Tongue and Quill, as well as local requirements if applicable.
Section 2D—Other Historical Projects
NOTE: Historian’s must use caution to ensure involvement with “other historical projects” do
not negatively impact their primary responsibilities.
2.9. Oral Presentations and Visual Information. Historians make presentations to audiences
interested in Air Force history and heritage. Examples of these projects may include briefings,
tours, staff rides, videos, and Professional Military Education (PME) presentations.
2.10. Exhibits. These projects foster an appreciation of the Air Force’s heritage and the
organization’s history. Historians assist project officers by researching and writing historical
commentary, as well as gathering photographs and other materials. See AFI 84-103, USAF
Heritage Program.
2.11. Electronic Reference Library. Historians may post historical reference material on unit
web sites, shared drives, or communities of practice (COP). Material intended for public access

  WRITING PERIODIC HISTORIES AND OTHER HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS

Section 3A—Methodology

3.1. Using the Historical Method. The principles and procedures in this section apply to all
historical products and activities.
   3.1.1. Perspective. Historians use perspective to determine what information is worthy of
   preservation. Select topics and documents with potential long-term value based on the
   organization’s mission, the historian’s professional judgment, and suggestions by the
   commander and staff.
   3.1.2. Impartiality. Historians are impartial observers and must strive for objectivity.
   Historians must be able to recognize factual and accurate data as opposed to hearsay,
   prejudice, or propaganda.
   3.1.3. Facts. Facts are the basis of statements and conclusions made in historical products.
   3.1.4. Emphasis. In the narrative and supporting documents, emphasize events affecting:
       3.1.4.1. The people that make history. History reflects the activities of people working
       individually and collectively to accomplish the organization’s mission. The history
       should therefore document how people performed that mission.
       3.1.4.2. Decisions and the decision-making process.
       3.1.4.3. Outside agencies’ actions and events that influenced the organization’s activities.
       3.1.4.4. The organization’s execution of higher headquarters policies and directives.
   3.1.5. Selectivity. Historians have access to far more information than they normally need to
   write historical products. Historians must carefully review this mass of data to select only
   the most relevant documents. For example, if a report prepared on the last day of the month
   contains information from the rest of the month, preserve only that report, not the full set.
   However, historians must be aware that daily reports may contain information not available
   in subsequent reports.
   3.1.6. Topics. All manner of topics and events come under the purview of historians.
   Emphasize significant activities affecting mission accomplishment. Especially consider
   information that will be useful to future planners. The list below indicates topics generally
   worthy of consideration for historical coverage. MAJCOM/HOs may provide additional
   guidance.
       3.1.6.1. Mission.
       3.1.6.2. Organization.
       3.1.6.3. Leadership.
       3.1.6.4. Relationships with other organizations.
       3.1.6.5. Operations and weapon systems.
 18                                                 AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


       3.1.6.6. Planning.
       3.1.6.7. Training.
       3.1.6.8. Logistics.
       3.1.6.9. Maintenance.
       3.1.6.10. Communications and information technology.
       3.1.6.11. Environment.
       3.1.6.12. Facilities.
       3.1.6.13. Community and host nation relations.
       3.1.6.14. Budget.
       3.1.6.15. Personnel.
       3.1.6.16. Mission Support (security, civil engineers, services, and medical issues
       affecting the organization).

Section 3B—Preparing Periodic History Reports

3.2. Research. Conducting timely, systematic, and thorough research is a never-ending process
and essential to preparing useful periodic history reports. Research must include direct contact
with people performing the mission. Successful historians build relationships with the people of
their organization. Information garnered from these relationships will validate and amplify
existing documentation. Moreover, personal contacts open doors within the organization and
may reveal additional sources of information. Historians must balance their time between
conducting electronic research and building relationships within the organization. The
historian’s visibility, interaction, and credibility within the unit are critical to the historian’s
mission accomplishment.
   3.2.1. Begin with an outline. The best model is the table of contents of your organization’s
   previous history.
   3.2.2. Review and apply feedback provided in formal assessments of prior history reports.
   3.2.3. Use the previous history report and the research file plan to develop a preliminary
   outline of potential subjects. Revise the outline as new topics arise. Various activities may
   overlap reporting periods.
   3.2.4. Consider recommendations from the commander, staff, and unit members.
   3.2.5. Conduct systematic research in files of key offices in the organization. Obtain access
   to archived e-mail files, organizational shared drives, restricted-access web sites, and other
   sources of information. Be particularly aware of organizations that destroy, transfer, or
   update their records on a short cycle.
   3.2.6. Establish personal relationships with project officers and information managers.
   These relationships provide an avenue of access to essential data. When these individuals are
   aware of the historian’s data requirements, they may provide valuable research assistance.
AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                              19


   3.2.7. Download only those documents or critical document collections required to write or
   used to support the periodic history report.
   3.2.8. Review material obtained through automatic distribution, the recurring reports index
   and directives pertaining to the unit’s mission and weapons systems. Subscribe to recurring
   products, e-mail groups, and communities of practice (COP) as well as policy letters,
   bulletins, and other potential sources of useful information.
   3.2.9. Establish a systematic method of filing and referencing research material. Historians
   commonly use a topical filing system. Add or delete topics as research and writing
   progresses. Besides using files as the basis for historical reporting, use them as reference
   tools for answering inquiries about recent events.
3.3. Historical Sources. Documents are categorized as primary or secondary. Primary sources
are original documents or first records of facts or events, for example, after-action reports and
trip reports. Secondary sources are other writers’ discussions, interpretations, or analyses of
primary material, such as magazine articles or books about some historical event. Historians
must use primary sources to establish historical facts and secondary sources only for background
information. Critically examine information and opinions contained in each primary source and
corroborate details, whenever possible, by comparing it with other sources. Information collated
from a number of sources usually presents a more accurate version of an event than data obtained
from a single source.
   3.3.1. Documentary Sources.
       3.3.1.1. Publications. Policy and mission directives (AFPD and AFMD), instructions
       (AFI), doctrine documents (AFDD), and in particular, organizational supplements
       affecting the structure and mission of an organization. Review them frequently for
       changes.
       3.3.1.2. Orders. Military headquarters direct and authenticate changes, actions, or
       procedures through various types of orders. Review all orders for possible use. These
       include movement, alert, warning, deployment, execution, tasking, operations, technical,
       and special orders.
       3.3.1.3. Correspondence. Obtain letters, memoranda, messages, e-mail, and comparable
       communications within and between organizations and key personnel that are important
       to documenting developments of historical significance. Historians require access to
       archived e-mail files, organizational shared drives, restricted-access web sites, and other
       sources of information.
       3.3.1.4. Reports and Studies. A staff study (point papers, memorandum for the record,
       staff summary sheet, etc.) analyzes an issue and establishes the central concern and all
       related facts. It presents various options and offers recommendations. Staff studies are
       of special interest to historians because they often precede and form the basis for
       significant decisions. Preserve these documents prepared by or about an organization in
       the periodic history. Include unit assessments and reports of inspections, tests, audits,
       major exercises, operations, and trip reports. Include as a supporting document in the
       periodic history an end-of-tour report prepared by a departing commander, if available. It
       relates a unique perspective on the commander’s major challenges, issues,
 20                                                AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


       accomplishments, problems, and lessons learned. Preserve studies and reports that are
       presented as briefings, position papers and talking papers.
       3.3.1.5. Statistical and Graphic Matter. Include organizational charts, station lists, order-
       of-battle information, maps, manning documents, sortie data, etc. They are indispensable
       components of periodic histories. Put them within the narrative or in an appendix. Fully
       identify the source of the item by including a full citation.
       3.3.1.6. Contingency and Wartime Data. Collect and record detailed data and
       comprehensive documentation during wartime and contingency operations. Such
       research is the highest priority for historians in operational units and headquarters. This
       effort is critical to later historical analysis, research, and writing. See AFI 84-102,
       Historical Operations in Contingency and War, Attachment 3, for guidance on wartime
       and contingency historical requirements.
       3.3.1.7. Meetings. Historians attend staff meetings, briefings, planning sessions and
       policy-making gatherings as a way to gain familiarity with the organization’s activities,
       increase visibility, establish contacts, and build relationships with unit members.
       3.3.1.8. Research Interviews. People who have firsthand knowledge of organizational
       activities are a principal source of historical data. Information obtained through
       interviews supplement the documentary sources and also fills the gaps that commonly
       appear in written records.
           3.3.1.8.1. Conduct interviews with the commander at least once during each
           reporting period to gain his/her perspective.
           3.3.1.8.2. When using interviews as supporting documents, submit the audio files in
           .MP3, .WAV, or .WMA format with full transcripts or time-referenced indices, or
           detailed summaries of the content of the interview.
       3.3.1.9. Accident Information. When covering accidents, do not cite mishap messages or
       safety investigation board reports as sources or use them as supporting documents. See
       AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, for restrictions on privileged safety
       information.      Never mention any formal findings, conclusions, causes, or
       recommendations. Cover the basic facts about an accident (presented in Part I of an
       investigation board’s report) in accordance with AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident
       Investigations.
3.4. Security and Administrative Markings. Mark and handle historical publications
according to the references listed below. Achieve a working familiarity with these directives and
guidance.
   3.4.1. DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program Regulation, and AFI 31-401,
   Information Security Program Management, and other pertinent directives covering
   classified information and guidance for handling For Official Use Only material.
   3.4.2. AF SUP 1 to DoD 5400.7-R, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program, for guidance
   on releasing records requested under the Freedom of Information Act, 5. U.S.C. § 552.
   3.4.3. AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities, for reports of inspection-related
   information. Maintain the legally privileged status tied to such data.
AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                             21


   3.4.4. AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific and Technical Information, for information with
   a distribution limitation (DL).
   3.4.5. Other guidance as published by such offices as the Controlled Access Program
   Coordination Office (CAPCO) at http://capco.dssc.sgov.gov (a secure site) and the
   Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) at http://www.archives.gov/isoo.
   3.4.6. Consult with the base information security office, the Air Force Electronic
   Publications website, the MAJCOM functional area manager, the AFHRA Field Support
   Division, or the AFHMP Community of Practice (CoP) for the most up-to-date guidance and
   proper declassification instructions.
3.5. Electronic (E)-History Policy. Air Force history reports are prepared and submitted in
electronic format. This format is outlined in the paragraphs that follow and more fully described
in Attachment 18. E-history reports are designed to be accessioned and accessible via the
AFHRA’s Inferential Retrieval and Indexing System (IRIS). They must be prepared using
standard Air Force desktop software and may be converted to Adobe’s Portable Document
Format (PDF) before submission. E-histories are fully hyperlinked and/or bookmarked.
Temporary exceptions to hyperlinking or bookmarking requirements must be approved by both
the MAJCOM/HO and the AFHRA Director.
3.6. Components of a Periodic E-History Report. Unless a part is identified as optional, use
all of the following components, in this order, in a periodic history report.
   3.6.1. Title Page. Follow Attachment 3 for title page information and layout requirements.
   3.6.2. Security Notice and Administrative Controls Page. Follow Attachment 4. This page
   summarizes information about the sources used to prepare the history. This page is required
   in every CD/DVD of a periodic history report.
   3.6.3. Frontispiece (Optional). Use a relevant illustration that will reproduce clearly.
   3.6.4. Foreword (Optional). A statement written by someone other than the author.
   3.6.5. Preface (Optional). An explanatory statement by the author or chief historian.
   3.6.6. Table of Contents. This is a hyperlinked information-finding aid. Keep the reader in
   mind by making it specific and accurate. Use short, descriptive unclassified headings for
   sections and subsections. See the sample in Attachment 5.
   3.6.7. List of Illustrations. See the sample in Attachment 6.
   3.6.8. Chronology. List significant events in chronological order. In some cases, an event
   may be discussed in an expanded chronology entry and not otherwise covered in the
   narrative. In these instances, the entry must be fully cited. If classified, prepare an
   unclassified edition of the chronology as a separate document for distribution throughout the
   unit’s staff. See the sample in Attachment 7.
   3.6.9. Executive Summary (Optional). A brief overview of the major events and topics
   covered in the periodic history, their significance, and the author’s perspectives or
   conclusions. If done, consider publishing the summary separately for wider distribution
   within the organization.
22                                               AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


  3.6.10. Narrative. As the major component of a periodic history, the narrative relates
  important events that are interesting, concisely written, and organized by topic or issue—not
  by the unit organizational structure. See the sample in Attachment 8. Use the e-history
  format in Attachment 18.
     3.6.10.1. As the major component of a periodic history, the narrative relates important
     events and developments affecting the unit. The narrative should be organized by topic
     or issues, not by the unit organizational structure. A high quality or useful periodic
     history does not require a long narrative. Do not fill the product by repeating excessive
     background information from previous editions or discussions not directly relevant to the
     organization’s mission. Use clear and simple transitions to connect issues found in
     previous and current history reports.
     3.6.10.2. Select topics or issues of potential long-term interest. Treat each topic or issue
     in the narrative according to its importance, especially its effect on the unit’s ability to
     accomplish its mission. Information requests received by the historian may also be used
     as a guide to topics or issues of long-term interest. Detailed data on many topics or
     issues--especially dealing with resources and support--could be needed for future
     reference and research, even though these topics or issues may not warrant discussion in
     the narrative. Preserve sufficient information about such topics or issues in the
     appendices and supporting documents. MAJCOM/HOs, in their supplements to this AFI,
     may mandate a range of topics to be covered in their subordinate unit histories. It is
     important that topics that were left open at the close of the previous historical report are
     continued in the current report to provide future researchers a comprehensive record of
     events and issues.
     3.6.10.3. The narrative must be original writing and not copied from source documents
     or boilerplate copied from previous histories. A narrative history is not just a summary of
     dates, places, personnel and statistics, nor is it mere statements of fact in outline form.
     Cover significant topics by not only addressing the who, what, when, and where of a
     topic, but more importantly, the why and how.
     3.6.10.4. Write in simple, direct and grammatically correct language. Use past tense and
     strive as much as possible to write in the active voice. Avoid military jargon, clichés and
     words not commonly known, if these are used, explain what they mean in an explanatory
     footnote. Define or explain scientific and technical terms. Spell out acronyms,
     abbreviations, and unit designations in the narrative. Do not use office symbols in the
     narrative because they tend to change over time.
     3.6.10.5. Provide complete dates in the narrative using military style, that is, day, month,
     and year. Example: 30 April 2010.
     3.6.10.6. Spell out the full given name (first name, middle initial, and surname) when
     first mentioning a person in the narrative and in the roster of key personnel. Abbreviate
     military titles only when followed by initials or given names. Example: Brig Gen John
     X. Smith. In later references, omit the qualifying part of the military title, spell out the
     rank, and use only the last name. Example: General Smith. Use the full title of civilian
     office holders without abbreviation in the text. Example: Secretary of Defense John X.
     Smith. You may abbreviate titles in the notes. Do not substitute pay grades (civilian or
     military) for position titles.
AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                              23


     3.6.10.7. Give precise geographical locations rather than post office numbers, grids, or
     general areas. Relate an unknown place to a better-known one. Example: Moody AFB is
     10 miles northeast of Valdosta, GA. Include all geographical names in the gazetteer, if
     used (see 3.6.16). Abbreviate state names only when they follow the name of a town or
     city.
     3.6.10.8. Place lengthy statistics in charts, tables, or appendices; explain their
     significance and meaning in the narrative. Include source lines at the bottom to permit
     use of the item as a stand-alone document.
     3.6.10.9. Spell out numbers in the narrative when they are less than 10. Never begin a
     sentence with an Arabic number. Always use Arabic numbers to express units of time,
     weight, and measurement. Example: 8 hours, 2,000 pounds, 20 feet.
     3.6.10.10. Use the 24-hour clock when referring to time, making clear whether the time
     is local (L) or Greenwich Mean Time, which is known in military terminology as Zulu
     (Z). Example: 2130L or 2130Z.
     3.6.10.11. Single-space all quotations of five or more typed lines and indent them one
     half inch from both margins. Use long quotations only when the meaning would be lost
     or the value reduced significantly by paraphrasing or summarizing. Use an ellipsis, that
     is, three spaced dots (…), to indicate the omission of any words from a direct quotation.
     Use an ellipsis and a period (….), i.e., four spaced dots, to indicate an omission at the end
     of a sentence. Omissions must not change the meaning of the passage. Give every direct
     quotation a citation, that is, an acknowledgment of the source. Put a footnote reference
     number at the end of the quotation.
  3.6.11. Graphics. Use diagrams, illustrations, photographs, maps, tables, and similar
  materials to add clarity, interest, and conciseness to your narrative descriptions. Caption all
  graphics with dates, subjects, classification, downgrade and declassification instructions,
  administrative or special handling caveats. Indicate sources used in the same manner as
  noted above for tables, etc.
  3.6.12. Photographs. Use only photographs of historical value. Do not embed them in an
  electronic history; use a hyperlinked photograph with a caption instead.
     3.6.12.1. In captions, fully identify the subject by listing the who, what, when and where
     of the photograph. Identify the photographer if known. Do not use copyrighted images
     without documented permission.
     3.6.12.2. Use high-resolution digital images (at least 600 dots per inch) when possible to
     assure high quality reproduction of images included in the history.
  3.6.13. Appendices. An appendix must be able to stand as an independent document when
  extracted from the history. List all sources used for its data and if classified, include
  downgrade and declassification instructions. Use a source citation hyperlinked to the
  supporting documents. Appropriate items for appendices include charts, tables, graphs,
  statistical summaries and compilations of details. Identify each appendix by a capital letter.
  The following appendices are mandatory:
     3.6.13.1. Appendix A is always Lineage and Honors data (see Attachment 10).
     3.6.13.2. Appendix B is always the Roster of Key Personnel (see Attachment 11).
 24                                              AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


      3.6.13.3. Appendix C is always Personnel Statistics of authorized and assigned (see
      Attachment 12).
      3.6.13.4. Appendix D is always Organizational Structure Charts (see Attachment 13).
      3.6.13.5. MAJCOM/HOs will establish additional mandatory appendices based on their
      missions.
   3.6.14. Footnotes. Cite sources of information in footnotes. Include hyperlinks to the
   documents cited in electronic histories. See Attachment 8 for placement and Attachment 9
   for format.
   3.6.15. Glossary. List, in alphabetical order, frequently used abbreviations, acronyms,
   terms, and symbols, with a definition or explanation of each. Use the format in Attachment
   14.
   3.6.16. Gazetteer (Optional). An alphabetical list of geographical place names with their
   locations is especially useful for organizations that are active overseas. Use the format in
   Attachment 15.
   3.6.17. List of Supporting Documents. List all supporting documents in numerical order,
   giving the same identifying information and classification data required for a footnote. Use
   the format in Attachment 16.
   3.6.18. Distribution List. Use the format in Attachment 17.
   3.6.19. Supporting Documents. A solid collection of supporting documents constitutes an
   organized database that is the most valuable component of a periodic history report. Select
   supporting documents that form the basis of the information found in the narrative. In
   addition, include supporting documents that amplify the narrative or provide additional
   information likely to be needed for future reference and research.
      3.6.19.1. Organize and identify supporting documents consecutively by major portions
      of the product. Keep the numbering scheme consistent for all supporting documents.
      Include all G-series special orders (in numerical sequence) issued by or for the
      organization during the period covered as the first supporting document in every periodic
      history. Individual social security numbers may be redacted. If they are retained, mark
      the document as required and control it as For Official Use Only information. Individual
      award orders may be included.
      3.6.19.2. Historians may organize a collection of well-chosen and similar documents on
      a specific topic, normally in chronological order, to maintain the integrity of the
      collection and to simplify document identification. Cite the entire collection of like
      documents in the footnotes with a hyperlink to each individual document. Example:
      “Rpts (U), 47 MXS, “Monthly Maintenance Summaries,” See SDs Jan 3001, Feb 3002,
      etc.” Additionally, the periodic history report’s List of Supporting Documents must
      include a complete document listing with hyperlinks to help researchers find specific
      documents.
   3.6.20. Disc Markings. Follow Attachment 2 for marking discs and jewel cases inserts.
3.7. Formatting the Periodic E-History:

  3.7.1. General style guidelines. Use 12-point Times New Roman or Arial font throughout
  the product, including footnote citations. Use single-space, one-inch margins, with full
  justification. Do not use multiple columns. For front matter pages, use lowercase Roman
  numerals centered at the bottom of page. For narrative pages and back matter, use Arabic
  numerals centered at the bottom of page or on the outside margin at the top of page.
  3.7.2. The Periodic E-History consists of a collection of individual electronic files submitted
  on CD or DVD to Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA). A root folder
  (directory) contains all the electronic files that comprise the history. Do not use
  subdirectories.
     3.7.2.1. The root folder name will be an abbreviated unit name with a space between the
     number and unit designation (e.g. 1 FW); followed by a space, the start date of the period
     the history covers (in YYYYMMDD format), a dash, the end date, a space, and finally
     the word “History.” For example, “1 FW 20040101 - 20041231 History” would be the
     root folder name for the 1st Fighter Wing’s 2004 history.
  3.7.2.2. The first file in the root folder will be a Microsoft Word document named “0000
  Readme.doc” and will contain information necessary to the archivist and researcher.
  AFHRA personnel will use the readme file, along with the title page and security and
  administrative markings page, to create metadata essential to identifying the document and
  its contents. The following information is required: the number of files that comprise the
  history; a description of the software and operating system used to create the document; the
  type of disc (e.g., DVD-R) and software used to burn the information to disc; and an abstract
  of key words that identify the most important topics in the narrative. The historian may also
  include any notes to explain file numbering or the like that would aid the researcher or
  archivist.
     3.7.2.3. The next file in the root folder will be used to navigate through the entire history.
     The name of this file will be “0001” followed by a space, followed by the name of the
     root folder (e.g., “0001 1 FW 200401010 - 20041231 History.DOC or .PDF.” This file
     will contain all front matter and may contain the narrative, and all back matter.
     3.7.2.4. The 0001 file must include metadata. In Microsoft Word under File, Properties,
     select the Summary Tab or in Adobe Acrobat Professional, under File, Document
     Properties, select the Description tab. The following fields must be filled out:
         Title: Identical to the name of the root folder as described in 3.7.2.1..
                     Author: Historian’s name
                     Subject: annual history NOTE: Information placed in the keywords
         section above will be entered into AFHRA’s Inferential Retrieval and Indexing
         System (IRIS), the UNCLASSIFIED database used to research topics and locate the
         information within AFHRA. Since IRIS is not able to perform a full text search of
         unit histories on the UNCLASSIFIED system, the keywords added here will be
         extremely important pointers used to help researchers locate information.
     3.7.2.5. Files that contain the remaining material will be numbered sequentially using
     four digits (i.e., 0002-9999). Consecutive file numbers are not required. The historian
     may assign a block of numbers to each component of the history but should explain the
     system in the readme file. Any additional information in the filename (after the four-digit
26                                                AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


     number) is at the discretion of the historian; however, avoid file names with more than 50
     characters and spaces because lengthy file names can cause problems burning the
     material to disc.
  3.7.3. The Periodic E-History must contain hyperlinks to each file. The reader will use the
  Table of Contents to navigate through the history. A hyperlink may point either to a file or a
  specific point within a file. Entries in the Table of Contents must be hyperlinked to each
  chapter, heading, sub-heading, and all major components of the history such as appendices,
  chronology, or list of supporting documents. All footnotes and references (like the list of
  supporting documents) to documentation in history must in turn hyperlink to the appropriate
  file. Do not include files on the CD or DVD that are not directly or indirectly hyperlinked to
  the narrative or appendices.
  3.7.4. Retain supporting documents and photographs as individual electronic files.
     3.7.4.1. Photographs collected electronically must be preserved in their original
     appearance and saved as tagged image file format (.TIF) or .JPG, but .TIF is the preferred
     format.
     3.7.4.2. Documents collected in hard copy form must be scanned. This includes the
     signed title page of the completed history. An electronic signature may supersede this
     requirement. For the latest guidance, consult the E-History Guide on the AFHMP CoP,
     which may be more current than Attachment 18.
         3.7.4.2.1. Scanned documents must have a resolution of at least 300 dots per inch
         (dpi). This enables Adobe Acrobat Professional to render (using optical character
         recognition) most of the text making the electronic file keyword searchable.
         3.7.4.2.2. Save all scanned photos at a minimum of 600 dpi and 4800 by 6000 pixels
         as separate files in .TIF or .JPG format.
     3.7.4.3. If an email is used as a supporting document, save it in any of the following
     formats: .PDF or .TXT. If the e-mail has attachments, the historian must either save
     each attachment as a separate document in its native format or in .PDF format. If saved
     as a .PDF file, it can be appended to the original e-mail or saved as separate, discrete
     document to be cited on its own. Only historically significant attachments need to be
     saved and preserved in the history. Do not submit Microsoft Outlook .PST files because
     they cannot be accessioned and microfilmed into the Inferential Retrieval and Indexing
     System (IRIS). Also, do not save e-mails in .OFT or .MSG.
     3.7.4.4. Save web pages in .PDF or .MHT format and include them as supporting
     documents. The history must not contain a hyperlink to a site on the World Wide Web,
     because web pages are not permanent and will not be accessible through IRIS.
  3.7.5. Full footnote citations must be used for each document cited in the narrative. Do not
  use file numbers without citations. This does not preclude the use of ibid. If ibid is used, the
  previous footnote must contain the footnote citation and a hyperlink to the corresponding file.
  This principle also applies to “See note above” for multiple source citations. If a book or
  similar open source is cited, such sources would not require hyperlinks. See Attachment 9
  for footnote formats.
AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                                  27


   3.7.6. Do not embed high-resolution photographs or multimedia files in the narrative.
   Embedded photographs will increase the file size and significantly increase the time required
   to download the file. In the narrative, insert a caption that fully describes the importance of
   the image. Include as much information as possible considering who, what, when and where
   the photograph was taken, any classification markings, downgrade and declassification
   instructions, and administrative or special handling caveats. Include the photo as a
   supporting document, and hyperlink the caption to the file. The historian may include a
   lower-resolution photo in the narrative (quarter-page), with a hyperlink to the high-resolution
   photograph in the supporting document.
   3.7.7. An index is not required.
   3.7.8. Do not include password-protected files or copyrighted material in the electronic
   history. Also, do not hide files.
   3.7.9. Submit the electronic history on recordable CDs or DVDs.                  Archival-quality
   CD/DVDs are preferred.
      3.7.9.1. The historian must verify that all hyperlinks work before recording the CD or
      DVD. Be sure to finalize the recording session to ensure disc access and prevent
      someone from adding files to the disc. Do not use rewriteable media (e.g., CD-RW,
      DVD-RW). The history does not have to fit on a single CD or DVD. When a history
      spans multiple discs, break up the history at logical points and do not duplicate any files.
      This helps AFHRA reassemble the completed history onto an IRIS server and restores all
      of the hyperlinks in the final product.
      3.7.9.2. See Attachment 18 for step-by-step instructions.
      3.7.9.3. Properly identify the contents of the disc by writing on the disc with a fine-point
      permanent marker. See Attachment 2. Leave the blank spaces on the disc for AFHRA
      use. Do not use adhesive labels on the disc.
3.8. Review and Coordination.
   3.8.1. Follow local procedures in coordinating draft portions of the periodic history with
   appropriate individuals or offices before submitting the product to the commander for
   review. Staff agencies ensure accuracy and completeness of the information and the security
   markings and handling instructions. They don’t approve or disapprove topic selection or
   extent of coverage of specific topics in the narrative. The historian will present the staff’s
   concerns and disagreements over these issues to the commander for resolution.
   3.8.2. Proofread and edit each periodic history before submitting it to the commander for
   review. Examine each history for accuracy of content and for compliance with the standards
   in this instruction.
   3.8.3. The commander signs the title page, indicating final approval of the periodic history.
   In the event of an extended absence of the commander, the vice commander or director of
   staff may sign the product. The title page is the only paper component of the electronic
   history. Once it is signed, a scanned digital copy must be included in the history. After
   digitizing the signed title page, the historian files the signed title page with the history report
   maintained by the originating unit.
3.9. Reproduction and Distribution.
 28                                               AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


   3.9.1. This is a three-step process. First, send one copy to the parent MAJCOM/HO or
   equivalent for review. Second, make any changes recommended in the review. Third, send
   the final copy to AFHRA/ACC, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424.
   Retain a copy at the originating organization. MAJCOMs may supplement this policy
   requiring: updated copies for their use and/or a centralized shipment policy for subordinate
   unit history reports.
   3.9.2. Follow MAJCOM and unit policy on distribution of additional copies. Comply with
   need-to-know criteria when distributing copies of classified histories. Consider producing
   unclassified executive summaries, extracts of chapters or other portions on specific topics to
   permit wider distribution.
       3.9.2.1. (Added-AFMC) AFMC historians will provide two complete electronic copies
       (to include all appendices and supporting documents) and one paper copy (narrative
       volume I only) of each annual history report to HQ AFMC/HO.
3.10. Starting and Ending Periodic Histories. The periodic history of an activating unit
begins on the effective date of activation. The final periodic history of an inactivating unit
covers activities through the inactivation date.
   3.10.1. Ending Reports. MAJCOM/HO determines the due date of the final (close-out)
   periodic history and ensures funding for completion of the close-out history is a top priority.
   Ensure historical reporting procedures are included in planning and programming documents.
   3.10.2. Unit Redesignation. Upon redesignation, do not break the periodic history reporting
   cycle. Maintain a normal publication schedule. Submit the history for the period in which
   the redesignation occurred under the unit’s new designation. Refer to the earlier designation
   on the title page. Example: 999th Wing, formerly 999th Tactical Fighter Wing. Ensure the
   action is a redesignation and not the consolidation of two units or the organization of an
   entirely new unit.
   3.10.3. Unit Transfers. When a unit is transferred from one command to another, send
   completed periodic histories to the former command until the effective date of transfer. Send
   completed periodic histories to the new command after the effective date of transfer. Send
   copies of periodic histories on the transition period to the former command if requested.

Section 3C—Other Historical Products

3.11. Semiannual Historical Activity Reports. This report documents accomplishments and
contributions by each headquarters and field history office and AFHRA. AF/HO uses it to
provide data to the Air Force leadership on the entire history program. Also, MAJCOM History
offices use this data to assist in the annual history awards program; therefore, historians at the
wing/NAF level should ensure their reports provide a detailed and accurate accounting of their
historical services. Submit reports to MAJCOM/HO by 15 July and 15 January.
   3.11.1. All MAJCOMs, DRUs and FOAs, with historians, and the AFHRA submit the
   semiannual Historical Activity Report (RCS: HAF-HO(SA)8202) electronically to AF/HO
   by 1 August and 1 February. Each MAJCOM/HO will provide courtesy copies to the other
   MAJCOM/HOs, AFHRA Director, and AF/HOH (for publishing on the AFHMP CoP).
   AF/HO will review the reports and provide feedback as appropriate.
AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                               29

         timely completion of the next historical report.
         3.11.2.1.6. (MAJCOMs Only) MAJCOMs will consolidate information submitted
         by their subordinate units, add the status of their own program, and include a
         MAJCOM-level table in their report.
     3.11.2.2. Participation in AEF deployments, exercises, operations, or contingency
     deployments. Include type (joint, combined, Air Force, MAJCOM, or local), who
     deployed and where, name of exercise, operation, or contingency operation, deployment
     dates, and types of reports submitted, dates submitted, and to whom.
     3.11.2.3. Number of information requests processed during the period that required
     historical research or knowledge. Report the amount of time spent on these requests.
     Break out statistics by quarter so that AF/HO can compile and present data in fiscal year
     or calendar year format. MAJCOMs will consolidate the totals but list the numbers by
     echelon to the wing or equivalent level.
     3.11.2.4. Most significant information requests, services, or contributions made during

3.12. Medical Historical Reports
   3.12.1. Under the guidance and direction of the Office of the Surgeon General (AF/SG),
   MAJCOM surgeons assign qualified medical service personnel to prepare annual Medical
   Historical Reports (RCS: HAF-HO(A)7102) on medical administrative and professional
   activities. Medical service personnel will ask the historian at AF/SGI for counsel and advice
   on medical history. Reports emphasize significant developments in military medicine and
   contributions to operational effectiveness. The command surgeon will sign the report. Send
   the original narrative, with supporting documents, to AFHRA/ACC, 600 Chennault Circle,
   Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424, no later than 31 July. Send one copy of the official narrative,
   without supporting documents, to AF/SGI, no later than 31 July.
   3.12.2. Medical service personnel also send special historical monographs, studies, papers,
   and supporting documents to AFHRA/ACC.
   3.12.3. The MAJCOM surgeons set policy and procedures for historical reporting by

3.13. Chaplain Historical Reports. The Chief of Chaplains (AF/HC) provides policy and
direction through chaplain channels for preparing a 10-year history defining the significant
developments and contributions of the Chaplain Service to the Air Force’s operational
effectiveness.

Section 3D—Administrative and Preservation Tasks

3.14. Retention and Disposition of Historical Records. Use procedures in AFI 33-364,
Records Disposition-Procedures and Responsibilities, to retain and dispose of historical records.
Follow the disposition schedule located within the Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS).
3.15. Collecting Historical Artifacts, Personal Papers, and Other Material. If a collection
of personal papers or documentary material of potential historical value becomes available,
contact the AFHRA/RSA via the MAJCOM/HO. AFHRA/RSA will perform an assessment of
AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                               31


the collection and provide further instructions on the disposition of the material. For historical
artifacts consult AFI 84-103, USAF Heritage Program.
3.16. Reviewing History Programs.
   3.16.1. Air Force History Programs at all levels are reviewed periodically to ensure
   historians are providing relevant and timely products and services to their organizations that
   deliver long-term value to enhance combat capability of the organization and the Air Force.
   3.16.2. AF/HO monitors the status of MAJCOM, DRU, and FOA history programs by
   reviewing activity reports, periodic histories, and other publications. AF/HO also visits
   MAJCOM/HOs and attends MAJCOM historian workshops to gauge the management and
   operational effectiveness of subordinate history offices.
   3.16.3. MAJCOM/HOs conduct periodic staff visits to monitor the management and
   operation of subordinate offices. They also serve as members of their respective Inspector
   General team and conduct inspections of their subordinate history offices.
3.17. Assessing Periodic History Reports.
   3.17.1. MAJCOM/HO or equivalent organizations assess periodic history reports with the
   intent to build useful reports of long-term value that enhance combat capability. The review
   is more than an assessment of compliance with this instruction and other relevant
   publications. It is a vehicle for providing mentorship. History reports submitted by
   subordinate organizations must be reviewed within 45 calendar days of receipt. The review
   process encompasses both assessment and feedback.
   3.17.2. The assessment criteria focuses on five key areas: Security; Content; Functionality;
   Format and Organization; and Grammar and Style. Attachment 21, Evaluation Process, lists
   the steps and questions a reviewer should answer in preparing the assessment of a periodic
   history.
       3.17.2.1. Security and Administrative Markings. For classified reports, conduct an
       extensive review to ensure all portions, pages, overall markings, and the Security and
       Administrative Controls Page correctly identify classified material contained in the
       product. Prior to submitting the report to the AFHRA, the reviewer must report security
       errors to the originating historian for correction. For unclassified reports, identify and
       report any erroneous administrative markings to the originating historian for correction.
       3.17.2.2. Content. The periodic history report must be reviewed for content in several
       ways. First and foremost, the historian must substantiate the report with a solid collection
       of primary source documents. The history should provide a comprehensive description
       of unit activities related to mission accomplishments and challenges. Source citations
       must substantiate the topics covered in the text. The reviewer must be familiar with the
       organizational mission in order to identify superficial content, shortfalls in coverage,
       and/or blatant inaccuracies.
       3.17.2.3. Functionality. The electronic file structure and format must conform to the
       directives in this publication. This entails properly preparing the root folder, including
       supporting documents in acceptable file formats, and hyperlinking to various elements of
       the history report (table of contents, chronology, supporting documents, and any cross-
       references).
32                                              AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


     3.17.2.4. Format and Organization. The format and arrangement of the components of
     the periodic history report must follow the guidelines and intent established in this
     instruction. The text should be presented in a logical manner based upon the mission of
     the organization.
     3.17.2.5. Grammar and Style. Review the history report for grammatical errors, poor
     spelling, military jargon, and unexplained acronyms. The stylistic guidance contained in
     this instruction is adequate for periodic history reports.
  3.17.3. The reviewer will determine an overall rating based on the five-tier scale currently
  used by the Air Force Inspector General: Outstanding, Excellent, Satisfactory, Marginal, and
  Unsatisfactory. The following descriptions serve as benchmarks:
     3.17.3.1. Outstanding. The Outstanding rating is reserved for a truly superior piece of
     historical research and writing. The report clearly surpasses an Excellent history in all
     respects. There are virtually no security or administrative marking inconsistencies. The
     narrative reflects the historian’s above-average knowledge of the unit’s mission and
     activities, and provides a breadth and depth of coverage not usually found in a unit
     history. The author discussed and analyzed all relevant matters in terms of the unit’s
     mission. The writing style is clear and concise. The historian used active voice and past
     tense throughout. All supporting documents are relevant. The history is fully
     hyperlinked or bookmarked and conforms to all e-history standards.
     3.17.3.2. Excellent. An Excellent history exceeds most of the requirements for a
     Satisfactory history. There are few, if any, problems with security or administrative
     markings. The history covers most mission areas and topics in a well-thought out and
     carefully written narrative. The supporting document collection is comprehensive and
     contains few irrelevant or insignificant documents. Most hyperlinks or bookmarks
     function properly. Errors, omissions, or inconsistencies are few.
     3.17.3.3. Satisfactory. A Satisfactory history meets the basic requirements of the Air
     Force History and Museums Program as laid out in this AFI. Security and administrative
     markings are generally correct and reflect a basic knowledge of the Information Security
     policies and procedures. The history covers key mission areas. The coverage is objective
     and includes enough detail to make each subject covered understandable to an informed
     reader or researcher. The history focuses on the activities of unit personnel working as a
     team to accomplish the unit or organization’s mission. The historian wrote the report
     using simple and direct language. Charts or tables depict statistical information in a
     logical manner and the historian describes and analyzes the meaning of the data in the
     narrative. The supporting document collection gives evidence of a thorough, continuing
     research effort and focuses on primary source documents generated by the unit. Format
     problems may exist, but they are few and easily corrected.
     3.17.3.4. Marginal. A Marginal history fails to meet the minimum requirements of the
     Air Force History and Museums Program and indicates a strong need for corrective
     action or additional training prior to the submission of subsequent histories. A Marginal
     history leaves out significant topics. It shows evidence of shallow, incomplete research
     and fails to include relevant supporting documents. The functionality expected of a
     Satisfactory electronic history is lacking. The historian’s effort to properly mark
AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                           33


      classified and administratively controlled information displays significant problems, but
      does not warrant an Unsatisfactory rating.
      3.17.3.5. Unsatisfactory. Any history that contains serious security and administrative
      markings problems will be given an Unsatisfactory rating and returned to the unit for
      correction. A history may also earn an Unsatisfactory rating if it is inadequately
      researched, poorly organized, badly written, and fails to function as an e-history. A

28 Oct – 5 Nov    (U) The 49th Fighter Wing (FW) conducted a local BOLD SHIELD exercise.
                  This exercise successfully tested the wing’s ability to deploy, sustain
                  operations in a bare-base location, and survive-to-operate after a simulated
                  attack. (16)
12 Dec            (U) As part of an Air Force-directed plan to improve oversight of service
                  providers, Air Combat Command activated the 93rd Contracting Squadron and
                  assigned it to the 49 FW. The wing appointed Lt Col John X. Doe (USAF) as
                  the new squadron’s first commander. (8)

                                    SAMPLE NARRATIVE

(U) The Road Ahead

         (U) One of the original hoped-for outcomes of the merge consisted of being able to
identify weaker students during the Phase I portion and matching them up with a stronger Phase
II instructor. (As of yet, this has not happened.) The one area that it allowed instructors to notice
was how the students did academically, which possibly prevented them from going on the
Commander’s Awareness Program as soon as in the past. But the communication between the
Phase I flight and the Phase II flights provided another benefit. Lieutenant Colonel Xxxx relayed
“It probably gives a little bit better picture of what kind of motivation a student has, maybe more
so then they would have had otherwise because the Phase I flight commander can spread that
news much more easily, and they have more direct contact with the student.” Possibly with time
the system will provide enough information where the matching will take place.2

        (U) It was also too early to see what long-term affects the merge will have on attrition.
The overall rate fell approximately one percent, there being no academic eliminations since the
merge compared to three for the previous 15 classes. 3 The number/ratio of flying training
deficiencies and drop on requests also remained about the same. In light of all this, no one
deemed it necessary to make any changes to the syllabus or the track select process. Captain
Xxxx summed up the whole purpose for the Phase I/II merge when he stated “As IPs within the
squadron, we have a vested interest in the students’ preparation and make the effort to not simply
push them through the syllabus, but prepare them for training on the flightline.”4

                            INSTRUCTIONS FOR FOOTNOTES

A9.1. Footnotes.
   A9.1.1. Introduction. Footnotes provide the primary means of identifying sources of
   information. In addition, authors may use explanatory notes for reasons of style or
   organization. For example, use an explanatory note to define technical terms or include a
   long list of names that would clutter up the text.
A9.2. Use of Footnotes. Use footnotes without exception. Footnotes are much easier for
researchers to use than endnotes, especially on microfilm or in scanned or electronic images.
A9.3. Numbering Footnotes. Use the word processor’s footnote function to number footnotes
consecutively through each chapter. If you do not use chapter divisions, number footnotes
consecutively through the entire text. The word processing system will automatically superscript
the footnotes.
   A9.3.1. Insert a footnote in the text immediately following the appropriate clause or phrase,
   without spacing.
   A9.3.2. Cite the source of each direct quotation. Place a footnote at the end of indented an
   quotation.
   A9.3.3. Single-space the text of each footnote. Indent the first line of each note one-half
   inch and double-space between footnotes.
   A9.3.4. Footnote citations will indicate if the source has been included as a supporting
   document by the addition of a hyperlinked four-digit number at the end of the citation.
   A9.3.5. Use the same font size in the footnote as in the narrative. For example, use Times
   New Roman, 12-point in both.
A9.4. Footnote Portion Markings. In a classified product, footnotes require a portion marking,
just like a paragraph. Mark each footnote with the highest classification the footnote contains,
immediately following the note number. For example, 16 (U) Memo (S/DECL 20190330), HQ
ACC/CC to 395 FW/CC, “(U) Operation GOLD BOX,” 30 Mar 2009, SD 1066 (Info used is
CONFIDENTIAL.). Citing a classified title makes the footnote a classified paragraph. For
example, 16 (S) Memo (S/DECL 20190330), HQ ACC/CC to 395 FW/CC, “(S) Operation GOLD
BOX,” 30 Mar 2009, SD 1066 (Info used is CONFIDENTIAL).                       This example is
UNCLASSIFIED. To avoid this, do not use classified subjects. See A9.6.4.2. The same rules
apply to explanatory footnotes.
A9.5. Citations. Keep note citations brief, using the standard formats in this attachment. Use
abbreviations, acronyms, and office symbols to shorten citations; however, do not be so brief that
researchers will have trouble identifying your sources of information.
A9.6. Citation Sequence. Footnotes must contain all the data needed to identify the source.
Document citations must follow this sequence: type of document; classification, warning notices
and special notations (caveats); declassification instructions; originator; recipient(s); subject;
date; paragraph or page number (in lengthy documents); and supporting document number, if
applicable.
AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                             49


  A9.6.1. Indicate type of document (letter, message, report, etc.). Use the document types
  listed in A9.10 below.
  A9.6.2. Source citations must contain the document’s classification, declassification
  instructions, warning notices, and special administrative handling caveats. Place these
  markings in parentheses immediately after the type of document, followed by a comma. Cite
  declassification dates in the following 8-digit format: YYYYMMDD. Example: Memo
  (S/Rel USA, CAN/PV/DECL 20330308), ….
     A9.6.2.1. Indicate any differences between the overall classification or special notations
     of the source(s) and the information used in the narrative. If the cited information comes
     from a portion that is marked differently from the overall classification of the source, add
     “(Info used is CLASSIFICATION)” immediately after the citation. Example: Memo
     (S/NF/PV/DECL 20180308), Col John X. Doe, 10BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al., “(U)
     Report on Exercise Bingo,” 8 Mar 08, SD 2401 (Info used is CONFIDENTIAL) or (Info
     used is C).
     A9.6.2.2. Documents with obsolete, invalid, or missing declassification instructions.
         A9.6.2.2.1. The marking OADR (Originating Agency’s Determination Required)
         was abolished 13 October 1995. For documents so marked, insert “Source marked
         OADR; date of source YYYYMMDD.” Example: Rpt (S/Source marked OADR;
         date of source 20040308), Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al., “(U)
         Report on Exercise Bingo,” 8 Mar 04. Documents marked OADR and dated after 13
         October 1995 are to be declassified on 15 October 2020.
         A9.6.2.2.2. Declassification markings “X1” through “X8” were introduced in
         October 1995 and abolished 22 September 2003. Documents with these exemption
         categories that are dated before 22 September 2003 are to be declassified 25 years
         from the date of the document. Documents after that date are to be declassified on 22
         September 2028.
            A9.6.2.2.2.1. A message that originated with an X3 exemption in 1999 would
            appear as follows: Msg (S/Source Marked X3/DECL 20240314), ACC/CC to 5
            BW/CC et al., “(U) Special Operational Mission,” 141830Z Mar 99.
            A9.6.2.2.2.2. An incorrectly marked report published after the rule change would
            appear as follows: Rpt (S/Source Marked X3/DECL 20280922), Col John X.
            Doe, 10 BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al., “(U) Report on Exercise Bingo,” 8 Mar 04.
         A9.6.2.2.3. The marking MR (Manual Review) has never been authorized for use as
         a declassification instruction. For documents so marked, insert “Source marked MR;
         date of source YYYYMMDD.” Example: Rpt (S/Source marked MR; date of source
         20040308), Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al., “(U) Report on
         Exercise Bingo,” 8 Mar 04.
         A9.6.2.2.4. For documents with no declassification instruction, so indicate and
         include the date of the document. Example: Rpt (S/No DECL Instr; source dated
         20040308), Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al., “(U) Report on
         Exercise Bingo,” 8 Mar 04.
50                                               AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


         A9.6.2.2.5. For documents with no declassification instructions and no date, so
         indicate. Example: Rpt (S/No DECL Instr; source not dated), Col John X. Doe, 10
         BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al., “(U) Report on Exercise Bingo,” n.d. In such cases,
         make an attempt to provide at least an approximate date.
  A9.6.3. Always include the originating office. Include receiving office(s) as appropriate.
  End with a comma. Example: Memo (S/Rel USA, CAN/DECL 20330320), 10 BW/CC to
  10 BW/CV, …
     A9.6.3.1. Include names as appropriate, especially on personal correspondence.
     Example: Memo (S/Rel USA, CAN/DECL 20330320), Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to
     Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CV, …
     A9.6.3.2. When the correspondence goes to more than one recipient, cite the first one
     and then use et al. (et alia, meaning “and others”). As et al is a commonly used word, the
     use of italics is not required. NOTE: In some cases, such as staff summary sheets, list
     the final, most important recipient only. Examples: Memo (S/DECL 20330320), Col
     John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al., …; SSS (U), AF/A8X to AF/CC, ….
  A9.6.4. Always include the subject when citing correspondence. Place subjects in quotation
  marks and end with a comma. Example: Memo (S/DECL 20330320), Col John X. Doe, 10
  BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al., “(U) Report on Exercise Bingo,” ….
     A9.6.4.1. Provide a short, descriptive subject, in brackets, if the subject does not appear
     in the document.
     A9.6.4.2. Replace classified subjects or titles with a placeholder in brackets. This is
     preferable to inserting a short descriptive title that might include classified information.
     Example: Memo (S/20330320), Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al.,
     [Classified Subject], ….
     A9.6.4.3. Designate exact titles of published works (printed books, pamphlets,
     magazines, and newspapers) in italics. Use quotation marks around titles of chapters,
     articles, notes, documents, reports, and the like.
  A9.6.5. Include the date or, for messages, the six-digit date-time group. Example: Msg
  (S/DECL 20330320), 10 BW/CC to ACC/CV et al., “(U) Exercise Bingo,” 201631Z Mar 08.
     A9.6.5.1. If the document is not dated and you know an approximate date, use “circa”—
     abbreviated “ca.”—plus the approximate date. Example. Memo (S/DECL 20330320),
     Col John X. Doex, 10 BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al., “(U) Report on Exercise Bingo,” ca.
     20 Mar 08, ….
     A9.6.5.2. If you don’t know an approximate date, use “n.d.” (not dated) as a last resort.
     Example: Memo (S/DECL 20330320), Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et
     al., [Classified Subject], n.d., ….
  A9.6.6. Provide a complete citation the first time any source is mentioned in a chapter.
  Thereafter, shortened titles may be used for frequently cited works. Identify short titles by
  placing them in brackets immediately following the full citation. Use shortened titles
  sparingly. Example: Rpt (S/DECL 20330320), Col John X. Doe, 509 BW/CC, “(U) Report
  on Exercise Bingo, 5 Jan – 28 Feb 2008,” 20 Mar 08 [hereafter cited as Doe Rpt], p 4, SD
  2209.
AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                               51


A9.7. Multiple Sources. When citing more than one source, separate individual source
citations by semicolons. Such footnotes are called multiple-source footnotes. Example: Memo
(S/DECL 20330320), Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al., “(U) Report on
Exercise Bingo, 5 Jan – 28 Feb 2008,” 20 Mar 08, SD 2209 (Info used is C); Intvw (U), John X.
Doe, 10 BW/HO, with Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CV, 6 Feb 09, SD 2210.
A9.8. Explanatory Footnotes. In explanatory footnotes (as distinguished from source-citation
or reference notes), write in the same style as the narrative (past tense, active voice). Place all
direct quotations in footnotes within quotation marks, regardless of length; do not indent
extended quotations within the footnote.
A9.9. Use of Ibid. When referring to an immediately preceding note that contains only one
source, use the abbreviation ibid (meaning “in the same place’). As ibid is a commonly used
word, the use of italics is not required. When referring to all the sources in the preceding
multiple-source note, use “See note above.” Beware of editing text that could reorder the
footnotes.
A9.10. Citation Examples. The following citations demonstrate many of the combinations
used in periodic history footnotes.
   A9.10.1. Attachments. Use this form when citing a document with attachments: E-Mail w/2
   Atchs (S/DECL 20171002), ACC/A3 to NORAD/J5, “(U) Alert Base Expansion,” 2 Oct 07,
   Atch 1, Memo (S/DECL 20170701), Maj Gen John X. Doe, 1 AF/CC, to ACC/A3, “(U)

   AF/CC, “(U) Expansion of Alert Bases,” 15 Aug 07, SD 3118. Be sure to indicate which of
   the cited items must be used to determine classification levels and declassification
   instructions for the portion. For example, (material cited is from Atch 2).

                                        performed. The American bald eagle, our National
                                        bird, carrying the globe, with his talons, symbolically
                                        indicates our global airlift support. Of the noble

                                        justice; white, the heraldic representation of silver, is
                                        for purity; and yellow, the heraldic representation of
                                        gold is for knowledge and enlightenment.

                 GUIDE FOR PREPARING ELECTRONIC HISTORIES

NOTE: The Electronic History Handbook on the AFHMP Community of Practice provides
illustrated, step-by-step instructions.
A18.1. Introduction: This guide is intended to direct historians in the preparation of electronic
histories. It is essential that historians produce reports which meet the standards necessary to
facilitate accessioning the history into the AFHRA repository. Currently, historians can
complete electronic histories using Microsoft Word with support from other Standard Desktop
Configuration (SDC) software applications like PowerPoint and Excel. The final product may be
submitted in Microsoft Word or converted to Adobe Acrobat Professional portable document
format (.PDF). Either approach is acceptable. This attachment focuses on the product. The
Electronic History Handbook found on the AFHMP Community of Practice (CoP) provides step-
by-step procedures to accomplish the objectives set forth in this guide. The AFHRA Field
Support Division will update the handbook as software menus and functions change.
   A18.1.1. Collecting electronic documents. Preparing useful periodic historical reports in
   electronic form requires a collection methodology focused on electronic documents. The
   following steps will streamline and standardize this process.
       A18.1.1.1. Develop a collection plan based upon your organization’s mission and
       activities. Organize the documents collected by creating a collection folder for that
       reporting period. The historian may divide the collection folder into subfolders (or
       subdirectories) in any way that facilitates construction of the periodic history. For
       example, some historians may divide documents by chapter and further segregate each
       chapter with topical folders. Since research is constant and continuing, historians should
       develop two sets of collection folders—one for the current history and another for the
       next history.
       A18.1.1.2. During the collection process, save electronic documents to the collection
       folders. Use a scanner to convert paper documents to an electronic format.
       A18.1.1.3. Backup Copies. Periodically (e.g., weekly) backup your collection folder, the
       folder containing everything you have collected to date. This task could be as simple as
       copying the files to a network drive and/or optical media like a compact disc (CD) or
       Digital Versatile Disc Recordable (DVD-/+R). Each backup should have a different
       name, i.e., 2009 Backup Hist1, 2009 Backup Hist2, etc. This procedure serves to protect
       against possible file corruption (and risk of loss). Performing a backup using the same
       name simply overwrites the previous file. Therefore, a corrupted master file could ruin
       the most recent backup copy. Keeping a series of backup files provides the historian the
       option of reverting to an uncorrupted version.
   A18.1.2. Research. During the research process, save electronic documents in their original
   file format. For instance, save a Microsoft PowerPoint briefing as a *.PPT file. In all
   likelihood, you will not use every document collected in writing the history, so conversion of
   files to the Adobe Acrobat .PDF format at this point would waste valuable time.
   A18.1.3. E-Mail Documents and Attachments. Save all e-mail messages as .PDF or Text
   Only files. The standard formats employed by Microsoft Outlook are incompatible with
 66                                                AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


   conversion of digital files to microfilm. Employ historical judgment to determine whether to
   retain any or all attachments to e-mail messages.
   A18.1.4. World Wide Web Pages. Save information gathered from web pages as either
   .PDF files or as Web Archive (single file .MHT) files. The historian must save the web page
   as it appeared when cited in the history and either of these methods will accomplish that goal.
   Do not create hyperlinks to http web-site addresses.
   A18.1.5. Dealing with Hard Copy Documents. Scan documents into Adobe “.PDF
   Searchable Image” (formerly called “.PDF image on text”) format.
   A18.1.6. Converting PowerPoint slides into Adobe Acrobat Files. To convert PowerPoint
   slide presentations into .PDF files, historians must review the slides to determine which
   method best preserves all information contained in the slides. For example, notes may exist
   within the slide presentation and by “printing” as Notes Pages, the historian will preserve the
   text beneath the slide. Presentations without notes might be equally well preserved by
   “printing handouts” as two slides per page.
   A18.1.7. Handling Microsoft Excel Files. Excel spreadsheets are useful documents, but
   pose some unique issues when printing or converting to .PDF format. Conversion to .PDF
   format “locks in” the data, creating a tamper-proof document. However, the conversion also
   removes functional data such as the formula used to populate certain cells. Either way, use
   Excel’s print preview function to ascertain how the information will appear on a printed
   page. Excel files often print differently than they appear on the screen and this affects how
   they will appear on microfilm and in a .PDF document. One option might include modifying
   the column sizes to adjust how much data appears in what would be the “printed page.”
A18.2. Writing the periodic historical report. The first step in writing the periodic history is
creation of a root folder. As you write the history, you will place the files created into the root
folder along with the documents supporting your text. Do not confuse the root folder with your
collection folders. When you begin writing your historical report, a daily backup of the root
folder is advisable to prevent losing your latest work. It is advisable to keep multiple versions.
Overwriting previous backups could cause problems if your “master file” became corrupted,
creating two versions of the corrupted file.
   A18.2.1. The Root Folder. The root folder name consists of several elements. The title
   begins with an abbreviated unit name. Insert an underscore between the number and unit
   designation (e.g. 1st Fighter Wing would be expressed as 1_FW). The next element
   describes the period of coverage. Use the YYYYMMDD format to indicate the beginning
   date of the coverage period (e.g., 20070101 for 1 January 2007) followed by an underscore, a
   dash, an underscore, the end date, and the word “History.” For example the 1st Fighter
   Wing’s History for calendar year 2007 would be: “1_FW_20070101_-_20071231_History.”
   Refer to AFPD 38-5, Attachments 2, 3, and 4 for unit and organizational abbreviations.
   Other examples:
       Air Combat Command 2004 Annual History: ACC_20040101_-_20041231_History
       Ninth Air Force 2004 Semi-Annual History: 9_AF_20040101_-_20040630_History
       NOTE: Ideally, you should not create the root folder within your My Documents folder.
       Should something happen to you, your work will not be accessible and could be lost. The
       root folder should be on the main hard drive or a network drive and might look similar to
AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                            67


     this: C:\56_FW 20060101_-_20061231_History\. If this is not possible due to security
     restrictions imposed by network operations, proceed with production of the history from
     your My Document folder.
  A18.2.2. The root folder must have a perfectly “flat” file structure. That is, there should be
  no folders within the root folder, only files. None of those files should be hidden.
  A18.2.3. The first element in the name of any file placed into the root folder must be four
  digits. Prefix numbers below 1000 with zeros (e.g., 13 would be expressed as 0013, 175 as
  0175). Adherence to this naming convention is essential for proper conversion during the
  accessioning process at the AFHRA. When naming files, please use no more than 50
  characters and replace spaces with the underscore. This prevents the file names from being
  truncated by the disc creation software and also keeps Microsoft Word® from converting
  spaces to “%20” which will break the hyperlink.
  A18.2.4. The Readme File. The first file in the root folder will be a Microsoft Word
  document named “0000 Readme” and will contain information required by the archivist and
  researcher. Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA) personnel will use the readme
  file, along with the title page, the security notice and administrative markings page, and the
  history report narrative to create the metadata (tagging information) essential to identifying
  the document and its contents. The following information is required:
     a. The number of files that comprise the history (i.e., number in root folder)
     b. A description of the software and operating system used to create the document
     c. The type of disc (e.g., DVD-R) and software used to burn the information to disc
     d. An abstract of key words that identify the most important topics in the narrative.
     The historian may also include any data that would aid future researchers or archivists,
     especially information that might help explain the file numbering system. See Sample 1
     and Sample 2 below.
  A18.2.5. Front Matter. The second file will contain all front matter (title page through
  chronology). It will have the same name as the root folder, preceded by 0001 [hereafter cited
  as the 0001 file]. See AFI 84-101, paragraph 3.7.3.3. For example, the 56th Fighter Wing
  2006 annual history will have a file named: 0001 56 FW 20060101 - 20061231 History.doc
  or 0001 56 FW 20060101 – 20061231 History.pdf
  A18.2.6. Numbering Files in the History. Each file following 0001 must be numbered
  sequentially.
     A18.2.6.1. The file numbering must place the contents of the root folder in linear
     sequence so that the files will be microfilmed in the correct order.
     A18.2.6.2. Some historians assign a file number to each component of the history report.
     When employing this multiple file technique, one must number the files sequentially to
     achieve a linear progression in the same manner as printed material (i.e. Chapter 1
     should be assigned a number lower than the one used for Chapter 2). In this type of
     history, it is essential that entries in the Table of Contents are hyperlinked to the
     corresponding files in the root folder.
     A18.2.6.3. Other historians have chosen to place all front matter, the narrative, and all
     back matter into a single file. This approach works best with Adobe files. Lengthy Word
 68                                                AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


      files tend to be more cumbersome and less stable. The single file approach provides a
      clear advantage in the ability to conduct effective key word searches. The following
      table depicts a partial representation of the files that might appear in the root folders of
      histories with multiple files or consisting of a single file:

Table A18.1. Example Root Folder.
           Multiple File History--Root Folder             Consolidated History--Root Folder

      0006 Appendix B-Key Personnel.doc
      0007 Appendix C-Personnel Statitics.doc
      0008 Appendix D-Organizational Chart.doc
   A18.2.7. The Document Numbering System. While documents must be numbered
   sequentially, there is no requirement for consecutive file numbers in the E-history. Using a
   consecutive system would require each file to be numbered successively through the last file
   saved in the history. The sequential numbering system allows the use of numbering blocks.
   For example, file numbers 0000 – 0099 can be used for the readme file, front matter,
   chapters, appendices, and back matter such as the list of supporting documents. The first
   number assigned to a supporting document must fall after the number assigned to the
   distribution list (not necessarily the immediately following number). For instance, the
   historian could reserve 0200-0300 for G-series orders; 0400-0600 for documents cited only
   in the chronology; and so on. Also, offices with multiple historians might want to reserve a
   number block for each historian writing a separate chapter to streamline integration of the
   product at publication time. The following sample illustrates how the documents would
   appear in the file folder if the Distribution List was file number 0099 and the historian
   assigned G-series orders a 0200 block designation and Chapter 1 supporting documents the
   block beginning with 1000. The files would be listed in the root folder as follows:
              0099 Distribution List.doc
              0200 GA-01.doc
              0201 GA-02.doc
              1000 Designed Operational Capability Statement.doc
              1001 20 FW Mission Brief.ppt
   A18.2.8. Hyperlinks to Supporting Documents. The periodic history is a reference tool and
   a guide to the supporting document collection. Hyperlinking connects the user to the sources
   cited in writing the history. Therefore it is very important to ensure that each hyperlink takes
   the user to the correct document.
      A18.2.8.1. Move or copy the supporting document file to the root folder before creating
      the hyperlink. Moving a file after a hyperlink is accomplished will break the link.
AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                             69


       A18.2.8.2. If you plan on converting supporting document files to .PDF, convert the files
       prior to hyperlinking the citation to the document.
       A18.2.8.3. As described in Attachment 9, when a source cited in a footnote is included
       as a supporting document, the supporting document number will immediately follow the
       citation. While the four-digit number is sufficient, some historians prefix the number
       with “SD”. That practice allows the historian to rapidly search text for supporting
       document citations. Variations of the renaming and relocation of a supporting document
       file are illustrated below:

       NOTE: The historian may choose to place any additional information in the file names as
       long as each file begins with four digits (including leading zeroes) followed by a space.
       Shortening the file name is permissible and may be required for excessively long file
       names. Excessively long file names could create problems in burning the history to disc.
       Modifying the name of a file after a hyperlink is established will break the link.
       Therefore, please limit file names to no more than 50 characters.
A18.2.9. Handling Attachments. Attachments may be combined into a single document using
Adobe Acrobat Professional or kept as separate, but subordinate supporting documents when
keeping the documents in their native format. In the latter case, simply add an alphabetical
character to the file number as depicted in the examples below, the File Type Description is
presented here for clarification purposes only:

Table A18.3. File Type Description.
       File Name                                                   File Type Description

   A18.2.10. Creating the List of Supporting Documents. List all supporting documents in
   numerical order, by chapter, giving the same identifying information and classification data
   required in the footnote. List all documents in sequential order as they appear in the root
   folder.
   A18.2.11. Creating the Table of Contents. The table may be constructed as the history is
   written but can be completed only after the pagination is firm (usually, this means after
   coordination is complete). In addition to supplying the page numbers for each topic, the
   topics and/or associated page numbers must be hyperlinked to the corresponding portions of
   the narrative as indicated in the example below.
                Chapter I- Mission and Organization .......................................................... 1
                Mission........................................................................................................ 3
                   Organization .......................................................................................... 8
           or
                Chapter I- Mission and Organization .......................................................... 1
                Mission........................................................................................................ 3
                   Organization .......................................................................................... 8
   A18.2.12. The Signed Title Page. There are two procedures for preserving the signed title
   page— one for Microsoft Word and one for Adobe Acrobat Professional. Choose the one
   that matches your publication method.
       A18.2.12.1. To create the Title Page for a Microsoft Word history, place the word
       “SIGNATURE” above the printed name of the signing official. Use the word
       SIGNATURE to create a hyperlink to a scanned image of an actual signed page. Treat
       the scanned image as a supporting document and assign it a number higher than the last
       supporting document in the root folder.
       A18.2.12.2. To create the Title Page for an Adobe Acrobat history, scan the signed title
       page and insert it as the first page in the 0001 file. You may find it useful to create a
       placeholder title page and replace it with the signed title page.
A18.3. Publishing the Periodic History to Optical Media. Use an approved recording
application to create a Compact Disc-Recordable (CD-R) or Digital Versatile Disc (DVD-
formerly Digital Video Disc). Roxio Easy CD-Creator is a common application used to create or
“burn” discs using either of these output media formats. Typically, a CD-R will hold about 700
megabytes of data while a DVD-/+R will hold about 4.7 gigabytes. For very large histories, use
DVDs to transmit histories to AFHRA. This facilitates accountability and control of histories
stored at AFHRA. In some cases, a history may exceed the capacity of one DVD, but the
hyperlinks will be restored when the history is reassembled on AFHRA’s servers.
NOTE: There are several types of blank media. Industry standards suggest DVD+R media are
the best for archiving data; however, older hardware may not support the +R standard. Check
available hardware before purchasing blank CDs or DVDs to publish the history.
A18.4. Submission of the Periodic History Report. Use a permanent marker to place the
name of the history and proper security instructions on the non-readable side of the disc as
shown in Attachment 2. Leave space for AFHRA technicians to provide additional
identification data. Place the disc in a jewel case and label the case as shown in Attachment 2.
Do not place more than one disc in a case or package any disc in a manner that could degrade the
AFI84-101_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                                  71


readability of the disc. Comply with all security instructions when packaging, tracking, and
transmitting the disc(s). Follow MAJCOM/HO guidelines in distributing the e-history. Ensure
retention of at least one fully functioning copy for the unit historical repository.

              History of the 416th Bomb Wing, 1 January – 31 December 2003

This history was published in an electronic format containing 579 files. All files that comprised
the electronic history were contained in a single directory, named “416_BW_20030101-
20031231_History.”

It is intended that the history reside on web-based servers at the Air Force Historical Research
Agency (AFHRA), Maxwell AFB, Alabama. All of the files fit neatly onto one DVD-R. This
disc transferred the report to the server, where all files are to reside in a single directory.

A copy of these files will be stored on archival microfilm and from that point forward, the
microfilm will be the record, or official copy.

The following hyperlink provides access the entire history report: “0001_416_BW_20030101-
20031231_History.pdf.” The Table of Contents is located within this file and allows for easy
navigation of the history report. The footnotes within the narrative are hyperlinked to the
supporting document files. The narrative was written in Microsoft (MS) Word and was
converted to PDF using Adobe Acrobat Professional Version 7. The end product gives the
appearance of a printed paper copy and enhances the long term archiving of the periodic history
report.

The supporting document files are in their native format, meaning the files are in their original
format with some exceptions. For example MS Word (.DOC), MS Powerpoint (.PPT), MS
Excel (.XLS), Rich Text Format (.RTF), plain text (.TXT), and images (.JPG or .TIF). The
exceptions are MS Outlook Message that may have originated as (.MSG) or (.OFT) formats but
have been saved as (.TXT) or (.PDF) file formats. Additionally, world-wide-web files originally
presented as (.html) have been saved in an archive format as (.MHT) or (.PDF) files. These
exceptions enhance long term storage of the information.

Microfilming requirements drove the naming of files. The software used to create a microfilm
copy of the electronic documents read and films the documents in alphanumeric order. The files
were therefore named so that the microfilm copy mirrors the printed copy.

ABSTRACT
Place a keywords or narrative abstract here. The abstract will help indexers at the AFHRA
quickly index your history. Keep the keywords unclassified because the information placed here
will be entered into the Inferential Retrieval and Indexing System (IRIS) on the Non-Secure
Internet Protocol Router Network.

           History of Air Combat Command, January - December 2005

This history was published and submitted to the Air Force Historical Agency in an electronic
format. The history includes 1,261 files in one single directory (folder) named ACC_20050101-
20051231_History. The files were named so that opening or printing them in sequence would
mirror the traditional paper copy RCS: HAF-HO (A) 7101.

File “0001_ACC_20050101_-_20051231_History” contains the table of contents and was
designed to link to all sections of the history including the supporting documents. It should be
used to access and navigate through all sections of the history.

The narrative, files 0001 through 0099, was written in Microsoft (MS) Word and formatted to
appear as written pages of 8.5 x 11 inches. Other formats for files include MS PowerPoint and
Excel, Rich Text Format (.RTF), plain text (.TXT), images (.JPG, .TIF), Adobe Acrobat (.PDF),
and world-wide-web files saved as “Web Archive, single file” (.MHT). All files open using the
Air Force approved software for NIRPNET and SIPRNET accounts as of July 2006.

The documents used in writing the history are included as files numbered 0100 through 5068 and
alphabetized as AFRC through Signature. The alphabetized files are all special orders with the
exception of Signature which is the title page with the commander’s signature. Files 0100
through 0343 are documents used for the chronology and appendices; usually they are not cited
in the text (chapters 1-4). Files numbered 1001 through 5068 are the documents used in writing
the text. A block of 1000 files was assigned to each of the five individuals who wrote sections of
the text.

ABSTRACT

The history emphasizes the operational activities of the command including support of
OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM, OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM, AND OPERATION NOBLE EAGLE.
Additional coverage is given to the command’s low density/high demand (LD/HD) systems
including both operations and system upgrades/modifications. Mission, organization, and
system requirements are covered in separate chapters.

Important events for the command during 2005 included the Initial Operational Capability (IOC)
of the F-22A, the MQ-1 Predator UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle), and the U-2 AN/ALG-221

                                  PRESERVATION PLAN

A19.1. Introduction. The key to establishing an effective preservation plan is a thorough
knowledge of what resides in the collection. Once this general level of knowledge has been
reached, it should be possible to determine priorities for preserving and protecting the most
valuable material, that is, the “Crown Jewels.” The Crown Jewels are materials not available in
the Air Force Historical Research Agency or other repositories. They get top priority in any
crisis threatening such material. If time permits, items of lesser value might be protected or
rescued. In any case, always remember that the human resource is far more valuable than
anything in the collection—do not take unnecessary risks in protecting material.
A19.2. Developing a Plan. When developing a plan, begin with the following questions:
   A19.2.1. What materials in the collection must be protected, rescued, or restored?
   A19.2.2. What tools and equipment might be necessary to protect the collection?
   A19.2.3. Does the facility have a fire suppression system, alarms, or adequate extinguishers?
   A19.2.4. Are personnel trained in the use of these systems and equipment?
   A19.2.5. Has a risk assessment been performed?
   A19.2.6. What local conditions should be considered when developing the plan?
   A19.2.7. What steps would be taken immediately before and immediately after a disaster?
   A19.2.8. What steps are in place to control rodents and other pests?
   A19.2.9. What equipment or services will be required to remediate damage following a
   disaster?
A19.3. Evaluation of Situation. After evaluating the situation, a plan might be unnecessary if
the entire collection is duplicated someplace else.
A19.4. Example Comprehensive Plan. See the AFHMP CoP for an example of a
comprehensive plan.
