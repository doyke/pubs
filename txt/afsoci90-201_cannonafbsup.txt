areas: training/preparation of installation personnel, exercising to that training standard and a
robust follow-up. The single goal of the IEPO is to prepare the Wing for any contingency.

2. 1.11.1. (Added) Organization. To ensure the accuracy and validity of these exercises, the IG
uses exercise evaluation team (EET) members for each unit from the Wing, group, squadron,
agency and flight level. Group and team leads help manage EET members. EET leads and
members should be highly qualified personnel who are considered subject matter experts (SME)
and should be chosen based on their ability to evaluate with sound judgment while representing
the Wing commander.

2. 1.11.4. (Added) Responsibilities.

2. 1.11.4. 1. (Added) 27 SOW/IGX. Wing IGX facilitates, exercises, and evaluates Wing and
unit requirements. To accomplish this task, Wing IGX will:

2. 1.11.4.1.1. (Added) Coordinate and de-conflict exercises and evaluations with the Wing
calendar.

2. 1.11.4.1.2. (Added) Provide overall coordination between functions of multi-unit exercises
and evaluations.

2. 1.11.4. 1.3. (Added) Ensure proper authorities conduct safety checks.

2. 1.11.4. 1.4. (Added) Maintain after action reports (AAR).

2. 1.11.4. 1.5. (Added) Ensure all EET members are trained.

2. 1.11.4. 2. (Added) Group Leads. Each Group will provide a primary and secondary Group
Lead on CAFB Form 2. The Group Leads are the senior EET members at the Group level. The
Group Leads will:

2. 1.11.4. 2.1. (Added) Manage EET members in the group.

2. 1.11.4. 2.2. (Added) Ensure the accuracy of the appointment documentation of the EET
members in the group.

2. 1.11.4. 2.3. (Added) Attend IEPO meetings and participate in the planning process to ensure
adequate group participation during Wing exercises.

2. 1.11.4. 2.4. (Added) Coordinate Group participation in Wing exercises.

2. 1.11.4. 3. (Added) Team Leads. Each Squadron will identify a primary and secondary team
lead on CAFB Form 3. The team leads are the senior EET members at the unit level. The team
lead will:

2. 1.11.4. 3.1. (Added) Coordinate with squadron leadership to identify members throughout the
organization who are SME’s to serve as EET members.

and tracked.

2. 1.11.4. 3.5. (Added) Coordinate unit participation in Wing exercises.

2. 1.11.4.4. (Added) EET members. Each unit will identify EET members on CAFB Form 2
(Group Level) or CAFB Form 3 (Unit Level). EET members will:

2. 1.11.4. 4.1. (Added) Evaluate their squadron’s performance during exercises and provide
written observations to Team Leads in prescribed format.

2. 1.11.4. 4.2. (Added) Attend planning meetings, as needed, to ensure unit representation and
SME input.

2. 1.11.5. (Added) Exercise Planning. EET Leads/ members who have regulations directing
certain types of exercises will inform the Wing IGX of that requirement. The EET manager of
that directing regulation will be the lead planner for that exercise or that portion of the exercise.
Wing IGX or a designated alternate will be the Exercise Team Chief when the exercise contains
multiple unit participation. An essential part of the planning process will be to train and educate
the populace on their real word response to what Wing IGX is exercising. The impact to safety
and base operations will be at the forefront of all exercise planning. All EET members are
considered trusted agents and as such will not divulge exercise information to unauthorized
personnel, to include commanders and Wing Staff Agency chiefs.

2. 1.11.6. (Added) Exercise Execution. The Wing will conduct exercises as though they were
real to the maximum extent possible but must always be mindful of safety. Off-base agencies
will be incorporated whenever possible to help build partner relationships and unified efforts in
case of a real world incident. EET members whether they were part of the planning process or
not, will evaluate their units to identify deficient areas, areas of improvement or best practices.

2. 1.11.7. (Added) Exercise Follow-Up. All EET members will provide Wing IGX and the
commanders of the units they represent with a report stating their observations, findings and
recommendations of the exercise. Commanders should empower their EET members to provide
honest feedback to IGX to help improve the security, safety, and response of the Wing. The
Exercise Team Chief will compile these reports into an AAR. Any findings or recommendations
will be briefed to Wing leadership, entered into the Management Internal Control Toolset
(MICT), and tasked to Self-Assessment Program (SAP) managers for closure. Wing IG will
designate the closing authority for each finding. SAP managers will provide monthly updates to
Wing IG until the findings are closed.

5.5. (Added) 27 SOW Self-Assessment Program. The 27 SOW embraces self-assessment as
a keystone in readiness and compliance items. Each member and functional area manager must
take responsibility to accurately assess and improve their programs, in a timely manner, and to
report program status. Toward that end, MICT is the 27 SOW vehicle to accomplish and report
self-assessments. The SAP is the commander’s tool for compliance with laws, mandates, and
directives. A proactive SAP is essential to accomplishing the mission within these guidelines.

5.5.5. (Added) Procedures.
5.5.5.1. (Added) SAP managers will perform self-assessments within each functional area at
least once a year or as directed. This instruction does not supersede or supplant other functional
guidance or commander prerogatives requiring more than an annual inspection. Functional
managers may also increase the frequency of inspections and may encourage inspections to be
done at certain times such as personnel changeovers within an office. This inspection will
consist of a review, inspection, and reporting on all applicable checklists.
5.5.5.2. (Added) SAP managers will use applicable AFSOC and Headquarters Air Force
(HAF) checklists. In an effort to remain standardized across the Wing, Functional managers
may develop local checklists that incorporate parent checklists for their annual inspection. Since
local checklists will not be automatically updated when AFSOC and HAF checklists are
changed, functional managers must be vigilant and ensure their developed checklists remain
complete and in compliance with new regulatory guidance. Any cloned checklists should be
automatically updated with changes of the parent checklist.
5.5.5.3. (Added) SAP managers will enter all discrepancies into MICT. They will provide as
much detail as possible, a get well date, and a corrective action plan.
5.5.5.4. (Added)     SAP managers will identify, track, and report discrepancies from self-
assessments, exercises, higher headquarter inspections and installation inspections in the MICT
database. SAP managers will document closure of these discrepancies in MICT only after
approval of the corrective action by the proper closing authority. Problem solving should utilize
the eight-step model available in MICT. Prior to closure, the SAP managers will insert
comments in the discrepancy field and/or upload documentation into the support section stating
how the discrepancy was remedied and what process is in place to prevent the discrepancy from
repeating.
5.5.6. (Added) Responsibilities.
5.5.6.1. (Added) Wing IG will:
5.5.6.1.1. (Added) Ensure a copy of all current group level SAP appointments and the Wing
MICT Lead Manager appointment letters are maintained within the Wing.
5.5.6.1.2. (Added)    Ensure the SAP meets directives and communicate any changes to the
Wing.
5.5.
6.1.3. (Added) Coordinate permissions/administrative rights for use of the MICT program for
all authorized managers based on appointment letters.
5.5.6.1.4. (Added) Monitor the status of all discrepancies and report discrepancy updates and
closure to higher headquarters as directed.
5.5.6.1.5. (Added) Review pertinent unit inspection reports to determine if and how any
discovered discrepancies may affect the Wing.
5.5.6.1.6. (Added) Provide training and assistance as requested.
