1. General Information
   1.1. Official Use of GMVs. IAW DoD 4500.36-R, Management, Acquisition, and Use of
   Motor Vehicles, and AFI 24-301 PACAFSUP, Vehicle Operations, all GMVs (Air Force and
   Navy), including those GSA leased using Department of Defense (DoD) funds shall be
   restricted to official purposes only. Transportation using a GMV shall not be provided when
   the justification is based solely on reasons of rank, position, prestige, or personal
   convenience. Questions on interpretation of the governing directives should be sent to the
   36th Logistics Readiness Squadron (36 LRS), Vehicle Operations Element (36
 2                                                                  36WGI24-301 26 JUNE 2014


     LRS/LGRVO) at DSN 366-2239 for clarification. Consult AFI 24-301 attachment 8 for
     additional guidance on GMV official use rules.
        1.1.1. Vehicle Operators will notify the on duty dispatcher when any individual is
        creating a safety concern operating a government vehicle. 36 LRS/LGRVO will contact
        36th Security Forces Squadron (36 SFS) personnel to request assistance.
2. Standard Authorized Uses of GMVs
     2.1. Permanent Party.
        2.1.1. Permanent party units requiring use of GMVs (pickup trucks, vans, or general
        purpose vehicles) for meal runs to the Dining Facility must have a 36 WG/CC approval
        on file with the vehicle fleet management office. All approved mission-specific
        authorizations will be included as an attachment to this instruction.
     2.2. Temporary Duty (TDY).
        2.2.1. Sortie generating vehicles (such as aircraft tow vehicles, bobtails, and other
        specialized flight line vehicles) must be used only for their intended purpose. Units shall
        not use sortie generating vehicles for non-sortie generating activities (such as transport to
        and from dining facilities or TDY lodging). Non-sortie generating transport activities
        will be accomplished using general purpose vehicles such as sedans, vans, and pickup
        trucks.
        2.2.2. Multi-stop vans are intended for use as a cargo vehicle. When used to transport
        passengers, the van must be equipped with proper seating and safety restraints.
        2.2.3. TDY personnel are allowed to use GMVs for transport to on-base NAF facilities.
        On-base is defined as the location stipulated on the members’ official temporary duty
        orders (i.e. Andersen AFB and not Navy Base Guam). GMVs are not to be used for
        transport to non-NAF recreation activities (e.g. sightseeing, fishing, hiking, diving or
        similar activities of a personal nature) regardless of proximity to the installation.
        2.2.4. TDY personnel are authorized to use GMVs for meal runs to commercial
        establishments.
3. Vehicle Misuse Investigation
     3.1. Report all suspected GMV misuse cases to 36 LRS/LGRVO at DSN 366-2239. The
     36 LRS/LGRVO Manager will initiate a GMV misuse case and send a notification letter to
     the 36th Logistics Readiness Squadron Commander (36 LRS/CC). The 36 LRS/CC will
     forward the misuse notification letter to the operator’s unit commander within 7 days of
     receipt.
     3.2. Unit commanders must initiate an investigation and provide as much supporting
     documentation as possible to 36 LRS/LGRVO within 5 duty days of notification via email or
     written correspondence. If a response is not received within 15 calendar days, the vehicle
     will be recalled until a response is received.
