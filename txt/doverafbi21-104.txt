This Dover Air Force Base Instruction (DAFBI) has been developed by the Maintenance Group to estab-
lish management procedure, in accordance with AFI 21-101 AMCSUP1 Chapter 7, Aerospace Equipment
Maintenance Management, for accomplishing document reviews on C-5 aircraft assigned to Dover Air
Force Base. This instruction applies to both 436th and 512th organizations and staff agencies under the
direction of the Maintenance Group Commander (MXG/CC), and to the Logistics Readiness Squadron
(LRS) under the direction of the Mission Support Group Commander (MSG/CC).


1. General Policy: Aircraft will have a document review every 60 days, and in conjunction with home
station check, ISO, refurbishment, cannibalization, depot, transfer or major modification. Cannibalization
aircraft will have a document review completed every 30 days. Due to mission requirements, aircraft doc-
ument reviews might not be accomplished precisely at this interval but will be accomplished upon return
to home station. The dedicated crew chief (DCC) or assistant dedicated crew chief will expedite aircraft
forms binder to LRS first, and then to Plans, Scheduling, and Documentation (PS&D) when performing
document reviews. Every effort will be made to complete the document review as quickly as possible to
ensure the aircraft forms are returned to the aircraft immediately upon completion. If the aircraft forms are
needed at the aircraft, Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) Supervision will contact the DCC to ter-
minate the document review and return the forms to the aircraft. PS&D will reschedule the document
review at the earliest date possible. Most importantly, maintenance personnel must accurately enter data
in G081 to ensure data base integrity.

2. Procedures: PS&D will schedule document reviews for each aircraft according to the due date. PS&D
will also schedule document reviews every 30 days for aircraft in cannibalization.

3. Responsibilities: All affected MXG and MSG agencies will ensure personnel comply with this
instruction. In addition, personnel involved in performing document reviews should be familiar with AFI
