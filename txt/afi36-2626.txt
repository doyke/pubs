Airmen that meet quality standards. It applies to Regular Air Force (RegAF), Air National
Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve (AFR) personnel. In collaboration with the Chief of Air
Force Reserve (HQ USAF/RE) and the Director of the Air National Guard (NGB/CF), the
Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel, and Services (HQ USAF/A1) develops
personnel policy for Airman Retraining Programs. This Air Force Instruction (AFI) may be
supplemented at any level; all MAJCOM level supplements must be approved by the Human
Resource Management Strategic Board (HSB) prior to certification and approval. Refer

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change replaces Chapter 1 in its entirety and revises AFI 36-2626 by (1)
distinguishing the differences between the Non-Rated Line (NRL) Crossflow Program and the
Missileer Crossflow Program (MCP), (2) clarifying the requirement for donor Air Force
Specialty (AFS) participation in Missileer Crossflow Program (3) clarifying selection criteria for
the Missileer Crossflow Program, (4) providing specific eligibility and exemptions to Missileer
Crossflow Program including volunteer opportunities separate from the process, (5) specifying
that AFPC will match officers to the first Vulnerable to Move List (VML) upon completion of
their initial Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) crew tour, send officers selected to
crosstrain to skills training en-route to their first duty assignment when possible, and provide
priority Squadron Officer School quotas to officers with en-route attendance whenever practical,
and (6) updating table of contents and glossary of references and supporting information with
Missileer Crossflow Program. A margin bar (I) indicates newly revised material.

                            OFFICER CROSSFLOW PROGRAMS

1.1. Crossflow Purpose: As Air Force requirements evolve, so do career field requirements.
Changes in requirements create inventory imbalances in affected career fields. The Air Force
has two crossflow processes to meet these challenges and rebalance the officer force.
   1.1.1. The Nonrated Line (NRL) crossflow program is a process to more effectively balance
   officer inventory to Air Force requirements. It addresses Air Force Specialty (AFS) manning
   shortages and over manning situations, and uses a methodology to facilitate shaping the
   officer force within authorized, funded end strength. To execute this process, a crossflow
   panel is convened when needed to select the best qualified officers to fill the required
   vacancies.
   1.1.2. The Missileer Crossflow Program (MCP) is a process ensuring the Nuclear and
   Missile Operations (13N) AFS remains balanced for sustainment by crossflowing excess
   officers at the 4-year point back to donor career fields. Donor career fields are those who
   have provided a portion of their annual accessions to support the 13N community ICBM
   crew force mission needs. During this process the Air Force simultaneously selects officers
   to stay in the 13N AFS and to crossflow to undermanned donor career fields.
1.2. Roles and Responsibilities.
   1.2.1. HQ USAF/A1P:
       1.2.1.1. Establish crossflow guidance and policy, monitor for necessary adjustments, and
       update as required.
       1.2.1.2. Determine officer crossflow requirements by AFS and Year Group (YG) based
       on AFSs with inventory imbalances.
       1.2.1.3. Consider impact of other force management initiatives (e.g., force shaping and
       reduction-in-force boards) and prior enlisted populations within each career field when
       determining crossflow targets. AFSs with specific or unique qualification requirements
       (e.g., technical education) should be filled first before crossflowing officers with specific
       or unique qualifications to other career fields.
       1.2.1.4. Approve or disapprove waiver of crossflow eligibility criteria and adjudicate
       crossflow in/out targets with Career Field Managers (CFMs) and other stakeholders.
   1.2.2. AFPC/CC: Final authority for action in coordination with AF/A1P and AF/A10 for
   MCP. Has authority to overrule the NRL Crossflow Panel or MCP results and disapprove a
   recommendation when appropriate.
   1.2.3. AFPC/DPAW:
       1.2.3.1. Select panel members and execute NRL crossflow program and MCP.
       1.2.3.2. Develop an AF/A1PT coordinated announcement message, application
       guidelines (establish an application window), instructions, and timeline for panel
       members.
       1.2.3.3. Notify officers of their eligibility.
 6                                                                     AFI 36-2626 3 JUNE 2013


        1.2.3.4. Prepare results package for HQ AFPC/CC approval and provide courtesy copy
        to HQ USAF/A1P.
        1.2.3.5. Serve as approval authority if immediate out-of-cycle crossflow action is
        necessary. Action will be coordinated with HQ USAF/A1P and will not require a
        crossflow panel/program.
     1.2.4. AFPC/DSY: Runs MCP crossflow model to indicate initial AFSC classifications.
     1.2.5. Wing Commander/Equivalent: Endorse nomination package providing comments on
     whole-person concept and recommendation for crossflow.
     1.2.6. Applicant: Complete nomination package IAW HQ AFPC instructions, prioritize
     available AFS crossflow opportunities as desired, declare volunteer status, and submit
     documents to wing commander/equivalent.
1.3. NRL Crossflow Program.
     1.3.1. A panel will competitively select volunteers and non-volunteers from career fields
     with overages for crossflow/retraining into shortage career fields using specific qualification
     and established selection and scoring criteria.
     1.3.2. Panel members will be selected by AFPC/DPAW and the panel will consist of five Air
     Force officers in the grade of O-6. The panel will be held to affect formal training and PCS
     moves.
     1.3.3. Crossflow Panel Purpose: The panel’s goal is to competitively select officers who
     will have the greatest opportunity to gain the experience with the highest potential for
     success serving in their gaining career field.
        1.3.3.1. The panel will consider the whole-person concept, including but not limited to,
        the officer’s application, overall record of performance, senior rater recommendations,
        academic degrees and transcripts (if required), specific qualifications IAW the Air Force
        Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD), officer professional development, career
        timing to assess the officer’s relative standing among his or her peers, and time on station
        (TOS).
        1.3.3.2. If necessary, select non-volunteers to crossflow based on a reverse seniority
        criteria (most junior officers in a year group first) and the whole-person concept to
        maximize return on training.
        1.3.3.3. Seniority is defined in AFI 36-2501, Officer Promotions and Selective
        Continuation, paragraph 3.7.1. The panel will consider the career development of NRL
        officers, however, it will not function as a Development Team (DT).
     1.3.4. Eligibility/Exemptions:
        1.3.4.1. HQ USAF/A1P will determine eligible AFSs/YGs based on sustainment
        requirements, manning, and other factors as required. Waiver authority for AFS/YG
        eligibility is also HQ USAF/A1P. Field grade officers or officers within the 12-month
        period before meeting (prior to) a promotion board to major in the primary zone may
        apply for crossflow but will not be involuntarily selected for crossflow. Consideration
        for crossflow to the 13C Special Tactics, 13D Combat Rescue, and 13L Air Liaison
        Officer AFSs will be on a voluntary basis only. Officers requesting crossflow into the
AFI 36-2626 3 JUNE 2013                                                                        7


      above AFSs will be directed to the appropriate CFM for consideration first but will also
      be vectored by the NRL crossflow program with a secondary career field as a back-up.
      1.3.4.2. Officers meeting the following criteria are exempt from involuntary crossflow
      consideration and ineligible to apply for voluntary crossflow consideration. Only waivers
      for Total Active Federal Military Service (TAFMS) will be considered. Waiver authority
      for TAFMS is AFPC/DPA.
          1.3.4.2.1. Officers with an established Date of Separation (DOS), including officers
          not selected for retention via Force Shaping Board (FSB) or Reduction in Force
          (RIF);

     Table 2.9. Officers who fail their initial skills training course will return to their previous
     career field. Subsequent panels may be necessary to meet career field and AF emerging
     mission requirements.
1.4. Missileer Crossflow Program (MCP).
     1.4.1. The MCP process selects volunteers and non-volunteers from the Nuclear and Missile
     Operations (13N) AFS who have completed their initial 4-year ICBM crew force tour to
     crossflow back into donor career fields or remain in the 13N career field.
     1.4.2. O-6 representatives from gaining donor career fields with shortages in the year groups
     available for crossflowing should, when possible, be part of the MCP process, to include
     participation in the crossflow panel.
     1.4.3. Crossflow Process Purpose: The MCP’s goal is to simultaneously identify officers to
     remain in the 13N career field and to crossflow officers to undermanned donor career fields.
        1.4.3.1. The process will start with the 13N Development Team (DT) providing AFPC a
        stratified list of all eligible officers based on the whole person concept, regardless of their
        status as a volunteer or non-volunteer to continue in missile operations. This data will be
        used to determine quartile distribution for the AFPC classification model.
        1.4.3.2. AFPC will run the classification model to determine initial AFS classification.
        The model takes into account career field requirements, officer preference, specific or
        unique officer qualifications, and quartile distribution.
        1.4.3.3. AFPC will convene a crossflow panel to determine final AFS classification. The
        panel will consider the following:
            1.4.3.3.1. The initial classification results from the AFPC classification model;
            1.4.3.3.2. The 13N DT-provided list of prioritized officers approved to continue as
            13Ns with enough names to accommodate 1.5 times the number of officers expected
            to continue in missile operations for a career;
            1.4.3.3.3. Senior Rater recommendations, Records of Performance, and officer
            preferences.
     1.4.4. Eligibility/Exemptions:
        1.4.4.1. HQ USAF/A1P will determine eligible AFSs/YGs based on 13N officers who
        are completing their initial ICBM crew force tour.
        1.4.4.2. Officers will have the opportunity to volunteer to crossflow to the following
        non-donor AFSs: 11X Pilot, 12X Combat Systems Officer, 13B Air Battle Manager, 13C
        Special Tactics, 13D Combat Rescue, 13L Air Liaison, and 18X Remotely Piloted
        Aircraft Pilot. Officers requesting crossflow into the above AFSs will be directed to the
        appropriate CFM for consideration first but will also be vectored by the MCP with a
        secondary career field as a back-up.
        1.4.4.3. Officers with an established DOS, including officers not selected for retention
        via an FSB, will not meet the MCP and will remain with the 13N AFS until separation.
AFI 36-2626 3 JUNE 2013                                                                          9


          1.4.4.3.1. Officers meeting the following criteria are exempt from the MCP. They
          will remain in the 13N AFS.
          1.4.4.3.2. Officers with quality control indicators (e.g., UIF, unsatisfactory
          performance, deferred for promotion, referral performance reports);
          1.4.4.3.3. Officers with 15 or more years TAFMS; and
          1.4.4.3.4. Officers with 6 or more years TAFCS.
   1.4.5. Specific Qualifications for Crossflowing: Officers must be qualified for retraining in
   the selected AFS IAW the AFOCD.
   1.4.6. Outcome:
      1.4.6.1. AFPC will match crossflow officers to the first VML after completion of the
      fourth year of their ICBM crew force tour. Officers who receive an assignment selection
      date or an assignment notification as a result of selection for crossflow may only decline
      via 7-day option IAW AFI 36-2110, paragraph 2.30 and Table 2.9.
      1.4.6.2. AFPC will send crossflow officers to initial skills training en-route to their first
      duty assignment whenever practical. Officers who fail initial skills training will be
      considered for retention commensurate with AF needs, or separated from the service.
      1.4.6.3. HQ USAF/A1D will allocate approximately 100 MCP quotas a year to AFPC in
      the Squadron Officer School (SOS) PRD/PGL to provide priority allocation to all MCP
      officers selected to crossflow out of the 13N career field. AFPC assignment teams will
      use these quotas to schedule MCP officers for SOS with a priority to the first available
      class.

                   ENLISTED RETRAINING PROGRAM ELEMENTS

2.1. Retraining Purpose. Retraining is a force management program used primarily to balance
the enlisted career force across all AFSCs and ensure sustainability of career fields. Retraining
also provides a means to return disqualified airmen to a productive status. Additionally, the
program allows a limited number of Airmen the opportunity to pursue other career paths within
the AF. The AF encourages Airmen to voluntarily retrain first, however, the needs of the AF
may require Airmen to be involuntarily retrained to meet sustainment objectives.
2.2. Retraining Advisory. The Retraining Advisory is the primary means to advertise
retraining requirements by fiscal year and is maintained on the AFPC Personnel Services
website. Retraining requirements are established via the Program Guidance Letter (PGL),
identifying the corporate AF approved training requirements and resources to support execution
of training IAW AFI 36-2616, Technical Training Requirements Programs. The retraining
advisory advertises two types of requirements:
   2.2.1. Objective Out: AFSCs where the AF has determined an overage/surplus exists. The
   AFSCs listed identify by grade the number of Airmen required to retrain out of these AFSCs.
   Exception: Does not apply to First Term Airmen (FTA).
   2.2.2. Objective In: AFSCs where the AF has determined shortages exists. The AFSCs
   listed identify by grade the number of Airmen required to retrain into these AFSCs. Airmen
   use these AFSCs to determine their preferences when applying for retraining.
2.3. Retraining Advisory Notes. This product is co-located with the Retraining Advisory on
the AFPC Personnel Services website. It provides specific guidelines and special or unique
requirements for each AFSC. Airmen must review the retraining advisory notes for both
retraining in and out AFSCs prior to submitting an application. Applicant must check these
notes closely to avoid delays in the application process.
2.4. Personnel Services Delivery (PSD) Guide. The PSD Guide provides documentation and
procedural guidance for personnel processes redesigned as part of the Personnel Services
Delivery Transformation. The PSD Guide will be revised continually with additional details for
web-based personnel processing applications (PPAs) to ensure availability of the most current
information and guidance.
2.5. Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD). This product is located on AFPC
Personnel Services website, Airmen must review the AFECD prior to applying for retraining to
ensure they meet the mandatory AFSC entry requirements. Each Career Field Functional
Manager is responsible for maintaining the accuracy of AFSC entry requirements published
within the AFECD and will coordinate changes with HQ AFPC/DPSIDC.

                          ENLISTED RETRAINING PROGRAMS

5.1. First Term Airman (FTA) Retraining Program. The FTA Retraining Program is
designed to retrain FTA in conjunction with a reenlistment, into skills where shortages exist and
additionally, allows a limited number of Airmen the opportunity to pursue other career paths in
the Air Force. Airmen maybe selected for involuntary retraining based on Air Force needs to
balance the force.
   5.1.1. CONUS assigned Airmen. Airmen may apply not earlier than the 1st duty day of the
   month during which they complete 35 months of their current enlistment (59 months for 6-
   year enlistees), but not later than the last duty day of the 43rd month of their current
   enlistment (67 months for 6-year enlistees).
   5.1.2. OCONUS assigned Airmen. Airmen may apply for retraining 9 to 15 months prior to
   DEROS if serving any portion of the normal FTA window (35th month for 4-year enlistees
   or 59th month for 6-year enlistees) on or before DEROS. Airmen with an indefinite DEROS
   must complete the original tour length before departing for training.
   5.1.3. Selection Process. HQ AFPC/DPTOT will rank the applications on the last duty date
   of each month. Applications will be approved and disapproved NLT the 15th of the
   following month.
       5.1.3.1. Applications are prioritized on quality indicators; e.g., most recent EPR rating;
       current grade; projected grade; next two EPR ratings; Date of Rank (DOR); Total Active
       Federal Military Service Date (TAFMSD); Aptitude Qualification Examination (AQE)
       score in the applicable area (electrical, mechanical, administrative, general or
       combination IAW AFECD, Part II, Attachment 4 (Additional Qualifications)); requested
       AFSC preferences
       5.1.3.2. Available quotas are evenly distributed throughout the Fiscal Year. NOTE:
       Exceptions will be made based on Air Force needs.
       5.1.3.3. Applications remain pending a maximum of 3 months. Each month the same
       prioritization is performed; however, there are always new applications updated as each
       month more airmen become eligible or ineligible. Each month, applications not selected
       for approval will remain pending until the next month for a maximum of 3 months, as
       long as retraining in objectives are available. If no retraining in-objectives are available,
       pending applications will be disapproved.
       5.1.3.4. Members may reapply once only under the following conditions:
           5.1.3.4.1. The Airman is on the Air Force Career Job Reservation (CJR) waiting list.
           5.1.3.4.2. The Airman was removed from the Air Force CJR waiting list, and is not
           within 120 days of DOS. Airmen in this category will be ranked for the month in
           which their retraining application is received.
5.2. NCORP. The NCORP is designed to retrain second term and career Airmen from overage
Air Force specialties into shortage specialties to optimize the enlisted force to best meet current
 20                                                                   AFI 36-2626 3 JUNE 2013


and future mission needs. Airmen possessing a secondary, or additional AFSC in a shortage
skill, may be returned to the shortage skill if it is in the best interest of the Air Force. This
program consists of two phases: Phase I and Phase II.
   5.2.1. Phase I Retraining: The objective of Phase I is to obtain volunteer applicants from
   identified overage AFSCs to fill requirements in shortage AFSCs. All Airmen with
   retraining out objectives may apply for any available AFSC with retraining in objectives for
   which they qualify. NOTE: Some AFSCs have retraining out restrictions. During Phase I if
   sufficient applications are not received and retraining objectives for the fiscal year are not
   met, implementation of Phase II is necessary. NOTE: All Airmen may not be eligible based
   on personnel restrictions.
   5.2.2. Phase II Retraining. Airmen will be selected for mandatory retraining based on Air
   Force needs to balance the force. The Master Vulnerability List (MVL) is used to select
   Airmen for mandatory retraining.
5.3. Disqualified Airmen Retraining Program. Air Force policy is to retrain only those
airmen who have demonstrated the ability to successfully complete training and whose past
record clearly justifies further investment. Retraining is not a guarantee and is subject to quota
availability at the time of disqualification and individual qualification for an AFSC and
retraining eligibility. NOTE: Not applicable to pipeline students.
   5.3.1. Disqualified Airman, Awaiting Retraining, Disqualified for Reasons Beyond
   Airman’s Control Reporting Identifier (RI) 9A000): Airman with a RI of 9A000 and
   otherwise eligible for retraining, will be considered based on entry requirements, class start
   date, and availability date. Airmen will be considered for retraining within 180 days of
   AFSC disqualification notification from HQ AFPC/DPSIDC through their MPS. Those not
   selected for retraining after 12 months from disqualification are no longer eligible for
   retraining consideration. Exceptions: Medical processing or other reasons deemed
   appropriate by HQ AFPC/DPSOAR will not result in RI change after 12 months of
   consideration.
   5.3.2. Disqualified Airman, Awaiting Retraining-Disqualified for Reasons Within Airman’s
   Control (RI 9A100): Airmen with a RI of 9A100, will be only be considered for available
   AFSCs for which they qualify and are otherwise eligible with formal training starting within
   60 days.
5.4. Humanitarian and Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) Retraining.
   5.4.1. To be eligible, Airman must have a valid humanitarian or EFMP application pending
   HQ AFPC/DPAPH approval and be a volunteer to retrain if utilization in an awarded AFSC
   at the designated location is disapproved. AFSC preferences are not considered.
   5.4.2. Retraining applications are updated by HQ AFPC/DPSOAR using retraining code
   "RF".
   5.4.3. Humanitarian retraining is via OJT using Career Field Education and Training Plans
   (CFETP) and Specialty Training Standard (STS) to document three level training.
   5.4.4. EFMP retraining is determined on a case by case basis.
5.5. Other Retraining Options. The Shortfall Requirements List consists of those: skills
identified with “unfilled” class seats, short notice class start dates (<60 days), quotas that have

skills applicable to the proposed retraining AFSC. Personnel must have or attain at least 36
months retainability to voluntarily retrain. If additional retainability is required to meet
requirements in the Education and Training Course Announcements, member obtains it prior to

       authorization in any awarded AFSC, retrained as an overage in the current AFSC against
       a valid requirement as authorized by the RMG PM or voluntarily retrain to fill a valid
       authorization.
