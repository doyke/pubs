1. Scope: Approximately 220,000 people die each year from sudden cardiac arrest. Most arrests
are due to underlying heart disease and result in irregular rhythms called ventricular tachycardia
or ventricular fibrillation. These non-life supporting heart rhythms cause the pumping action of
the heart to stop abruptly and the victim to lose consciousness and become pulseless and
breathless. The technique of delivering an electrical shock, called defibrillation, is the only
known treatment for ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. To be
effective, defibrillation must be administered within minutes of a cardiac arrest. For every
minute that passes without defibrillation, a victim‘s chance of survival decrease 7 to 10 percent.
After as little as 10 minutes, very few resuscitation attempts are successful. In the past the
ability to defibrillate was solely in the hands of trained emergency medical personnel, which may
have long response times. With the advent of the automated external defibrillator (AED), a
trained rescuer can quickly and easily defibrillate a cardiac arrest victim and potentially save
lives. New generation AEDs are safe, effective, lightweight, low maintenance, and relatively
inexpensive. In August 2003 the Secretary of Defense mandated that military installations
establish public access defibrillation (PAD) programs with consideration for placement of AEDs
in federal buildings. This document describes AFMC guidance on roles and responsibilities
deemed necessary to ensure the broadest training and appropriate first response AED utilization.
The scope of training and use is applicable to all federal employees and active duty personnel
throughout AFMC.

      and can respond to an event. Certified training is available through the American Heart
      Association or the American Red Cross.
      2.7.9. After an AED is used in an emergency situation, the AED POC or the responder
      will immediately complete the AED Coordination Report for Medical Director
      (Attachment 6), and forward it to the Medical Director for review. The Medical Director
      should receive the completed report within one duty day of the AED use event.
      2.7.10. Arranges for Traumatic Stress Response (TSR) debriefing sessions to be offered
      for all individuals involved in providing assistance in an emergency situation
      (Attachment 6) as needed.
      2.7.11. Coordinates all concerns with AED use, training and new purchases, with PAD
      medical director and/or medical logistics as needed.
      2.7.12. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Attachments 16 and 17.
   2.8. Responders:
      2.8.1. Are currently certified in CPR/AED use and will respond to an emergency.
      Specific training and certification is available through the American Heart Association or
      the American Red Cross.
      2.8.2. Follow the protocol in an emergency situation as depicted in the AED Treatment
      Algorithm (Attachment 4).
3. AED Model Selection:
   3.1. AED model selection will be determined by the installation Medical Director, based on
   recommendations from the installation‘s Medical Logistics staff. They will utilize a list of
   comparable products. A single AED model should be purchased for the installation.
   Standardization of AED models will ease responder familiarization, unit maintenance and
   supply logistics. AED models should be considered based on simplicity of use, durability,
   battery life, internal memory, warranty, cost, and available training packages.
4. AED Location and Installation:
   4.1. The essential key to surviving a heart attack is early CPR and defibrillation, when
   indicated. Therefore, AEDs should be strategically placed throughout a unit facility to reduce
   time between victim collapse and ability to provide initial shock when indicated to a heart
   attack victim.

           4.1.1.4. Number of people that may have public access to the facility on a daily basis.
           4.1.1.5. Average age of the facility occupants; older populations are at higher risk.
           4.1.1.6. Security levels that may hinder access to the facility by emergency response
           crews.
           4.1.1.7. Increase risk of incidence of heart disease given the communication
           population as reported by local, state and national health departments.
           4.1.1.8. Use of high voltage electrical equipment.
           4.1.1.9. Emergency response protocol that may already be in place for your facility,
           keeping in mind that early initial shock when indicated increases potential for
           survival.
    4.2. To achieve optimal area coverage within a building, an AED should be positioned no
    more than one minute's travel time (one way) from any given point within the building.
    4.3. Optimal response time from the identification of a person "down" to the arrival of AED
    on-scene is three minutes or less.
    4.4. Optimal response time from the identification of a person down to the delivery of a
    shock (i.e. drop-to-shock) should be less than five minutes.
    4.5. AED accessory kits should be packed with the AED so that the responder will not lose
    time deciding what to take to the emergency. These kits should provide items such as gloves,
    scissors, razor, tape, extra electrodes and a barrier mask (Attachment 7).
    4.6. AEDs should be stored in such a way that an alarm is activated when the unit is
    removed for use. This can be set up as a central alarm, whereby the local EMS is
    automatically notified, or as a local sounding alarm that can draw assistance to the scene.
    4.7. (Added-ROBINSAFB) AED PLACEMENT
    4.8. (Added-ROBINSAFB) This final list of recommended locations for AED placement
    will be coordinated with base agencies for comment and reconsideration before final
    approval by 78 ABW/CC for implementation.
    4.9. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Senior officials choosing not to implement recommendations
    to implement the PAD program from the PAD Medical Director may request a waiver from
    the 78 ABW/CC by routing the request describing the alternative risk management plan to
    address SCA risk with endorsement by the PAD Medical Director.
    4.10. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Senior officials of any unit identified as a recommended
    location for an AED will work with the Installation PC to implement this program to the
    fullest extent allowable.
AFMCI10-301_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2010                                                      9


   4.11. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Unit senior officials who elect to deploy AEDs in their
   facilities will consider the factors listed in AFMCI 10-301, Section 4 (AED Location and
   Installation.) The Installation PC and PAD Medical Director will be available to assist any
   units in AED placement decisions.
   4.12. (Added-ROBINSAFB) . In each facility where there are multiple unit occupants, the
   senior official funding the most AEDs, or, if two units have funded the same number of
   AEDs, then the unit with the most personnel in that facility will be considered the primary
   senior official and will coordinate the actions of all organizations within that facility to
   ensure a comprehensive and clear AED deployment strategy. Additionally, organizations
   within multi-user facilities will provide trained personnel for the responders cadre
   proportional to their respective employee population.
   4.13. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Signage marking AED locations is mandated by AFMC 10-
   301. If used, additional signage should facilitate rapid emergency response, retrieval, and
   use of the AED. The use of markers, flags, or responder lists to identify trained responders in
   a facility should be balanced with the effective use of a cry for help to identify the nearest
   trained responder. If used, the AED POC is responsible to ensure currency of these tools.
   The standard identification symbol will be the emblem found in Attachment 18.
5. Emergency Response:
   5.1. An event timeline for a responder should ideally be as follows:
      5.1.1. Minute #1.
          5.1.1.1. Discovery of ―downed‖ victim: Initiate Chain of Survival; Activate 9-1-1.
          5.1.1.2. Decision to retrieve AED.
          5.1.1.3. Identify closest AED.
      5.1.2. Minute #2-3.
          5.1.2.1. Retrieval of AED (round trip).
      5.1.3. Minute #4.
          5.1.3.1. Re-familiarization with AED instructions.
          5.1.3.2. Preparation of victim and application of chest pads.
          5.1.3.3. Detection of shockable rhythm.
          5.1.3.4. Delivery of shock.
   5.2. Depending on the population served in the facility, some AED locations will contain
   both adult and child chest leads. AEDs with both adult and child leads will be clearly marked
   by a sign stating ―This device is equipped with both Adult and Child chest pads. Please check
10                                AFMCI10-301_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2010




  to ensure appropriate pads are utilized.‖ on the outside of the AED cabinet. Specialized child
  chest leads are labeled CHILD on the package to prevent accidental misuse. Users should
  check to ensure they have the correct chest pads prior to application.

                                    TSR INFORMATION

A6.1. Traumatic Stress Response [formerly Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM)
Information]
   A6.1.1. What is TSR?
      A6.1.1.1. The primary goal of TSR teams is to foster resiliency in those exposed to
      potentially traumatic stress. This is accomplished through preparatory education for those
      likely to experience potentially traumatic stress, and through education, screening,
      psychological first aid, and referral for those exposed to potentially traumatic stress. TSR
      teams (1) serve as trauma response consultants to unit leaders; (2) prepare personnel
      likely to be exposed to potentially traumatic events; and (3) provide screening, education,
      psychological first aid, and referral for those exposed to potentially traumatic events. This
      document also provides revised training guidance.
A6.2. What events might precipitate a request for TSR services?
   A6.2.1. TSR services may be provided in response to events at the request of the unit
   commander. The services provided will vary depending on the nature of the mishap and the
   needs of the squadrons involved in the mishap. In general, the commander of any unit that
   incurs loss of personnel or significant injury to personnel as a result of a mishap should
   consult with a TSR team leader to determine whether there is a need for TSR support. Then,
   if the commander subsequently requests service, the nature of those services should be
   developed by the commander in collaboration with the TSR team leader.
   A6.2.2. Many types of events have the potential to produce individual and community
   traumatic stress. Events include: large scale disasters (tornadoes, bombings, hurricanes, etc.)
   and small scale disasters (suicide, death or near-death of coworker, workplace violence
   event, etc.). TSR services will be provided after traumatic events to help those who have
   experienced the events. The goal is to assist those affected by traumatic events to cope with
   the normal stress reaction in an effective manner. These actions are intended to minimize the
   impact of exposure to these events and prevent or mitigate permanent disability if possible.
A6.3. What is the procedure for requesting TSR services?
   A6.3.1. The office of record for TSR services is the Life Skills Support Center. The affected
   wing commander will support or arrange for consultation between the TSR team chief and
   the affected unit commander to determine what level of service, if any, is needed.
