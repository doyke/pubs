                                           Chapter 1

                                            POLICY

1.1. General. This instruction prescribes basic guidance for training United States Air Force
Small Unmanned Aircraft System Operators (SUAS-O). Small UAS are defined as UAS less
than 1320 lbs gross weight (Groups 1-3 of Figure A2.1). Air Force Special Operations Command
(AFSOC) is designated Lead Command for Groups 1-3 UAS (generally referred to as SUAS).
Coordinating SUAS with other manned and unmanned aircraft and surface maneuver units
requires detailed integration and understanding of the tactical environment. This instruction
provides program and training guidance. AFI 11-502, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems
Training, volumes 1, 2, & 3 draw from the respective AFI 11-202, General Flight Rules,
volumes 1, 2, & 3, with modifications tailored to Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems; knowledge
of the AFI 11-202 series is highly encouraged in order to fully understand the parallels and
differences between systems and their supporting instructions.
1.2. Key Definitions:
     1.2.1. ―Will‖ and ―Shall‖ indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.2.2. ―Should‖ indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment.
     1.2.3. ―May‖ indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
1.3. Program Objectives. The overall objective of the SUAS training program is to develop
and maintain a high state of mission readiness for immediate and effective employment across
the range of military operations. The Air Force SUAS Training Program ensures all SUAS-Os
obtain and maintain the qualification and proficiency needed to effectively perform their unit’s
mission. Programs should strive to minimize the amount of retraining necessary when personnel
return to duties for SUAS in which they were previously qualified.
1.4. Waiver Authority. Unless otherwise specified in this instruction, HAF/A3O-AS is the
waiver authority for this instruction. Waivers to the basic guidance in this instruction will be
requested through applicable training channels to MAJCOM/A3, or equivalent level.
MAJCOM/A3s will forward request in message or memo format to HAF/A3O-AS. Waivers to
supplemental guidance will be handled by the MAJCOM agency that generated the supplement.
Unless otherwise specified in AFI 11-5 Group-specific, Volume 1, MAJCOM/A3s are the waiver
authority for specific individual SUAS crewmember training requirements. Waivers to this
instruction will be valid for a maximum period of 12 months from approval date. Units assigned,
attached, or under operational control of a geographic combatant commander will request
waivers through the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) who may approve,
disapprove, or forward to HAF/A3O-AS for resolution, with a copy to HQ AFSOC/A3OU
(Exception: AFMC is not required to send a copy to HQ AFSOC/A3OU.) HAF/A3O-AS will
authorize waivers to this directive only for essential MAJCOM requirements.

                    TRAINING AND QUALIFICATIONS STANDARDS

2.1. General. SUAS-Os are trained, qualified and authorized to plan and conduct SUAS
operations (SUAS-OPS) in approved airspace. SUAS Instructors (SUAS-I) are qualified to
conduct SUAS training and are selected by their unit commander based on performance
recommendations from the SUAS Evaluators (SUAS-E). SUAS-Es are the best-qualified SUAS-
Is to conduct SUAS evaluations. SUAS-Es are selected by the unit commander based on
recommendations from the lead SUAS-E. Standardized training for SUAS-Os is essential to safe
and effective employment of SUAS. SUAS training standards established in this instruction
ensure SUAS-Os are properly qualified to safely control Air Force SUAS. These standards also
provide commanders with quantitative mission performance indicators for assessing SUAS-Os
and determining individual mission readiness. This instruction provides guidance for conducting
a SUAS training program that will complement AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.
2.2. Unit SUAS Training Program. Units will design their SUAS training programs to achieve
the highest degree of individual . Training objectives must balance the need for realism against
expected risk when executing SUAS mission essential tasks. Air Force standards that govern
safety of flight, as well as the safety of surface forces, apply during the administration of the
overall training program. Training criteria should include Crew Resource Management (CRM)
techniques. See AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, and
MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
   2.2.1. Unit SUAS training requirements incorporated in the unit supplement will be
   forwarded to the Group SUAS-I/TM for review. MAJCOM-designated SUAS Training POC

   and evaluation IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program and all applicable directives.
   Individual training records will be entered, maintained, and accessed through the Small UAS
   Manager (SUASMAN) web-enabled database. Use of supplemental paper-based records is at
   the discretion of the unit commander. SUAS Instructors will coordinate inputs to an
   individual’s training record with supervisors and the unit’s TM as appropriate to ensure
   SUAS training documentation is completed as required. The use of automated products is
   authorized. If automated products are used, they will be included in an individual’s training
   folder upon PCA, PCS, or when TDY in support of exercises and contingencies. Exception:
   AFMC will maintain training records on forms and automated products currently approved
   for use in AFMC test operations.
2.3. Certification & Documentation. All SUAS-O/I/Es will be certified. This training and
certification will be documented on an AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard
Continuation/Command JQS or a suitable computer product and will be maintained in the

automated products currently approved for use in AFMC for test operations.
   2.3.1. Training/Certification Routing/Signing Procedures: The proper routing procedures
   are: SUAS-I, trainee’s supervisor, unit commander, and trainee. After all individuals in the
   routing chain sign the training/certification form, it will be returned to the Training and/or
   Stan/Eval Section and placed in the trainee’s training folder.
2.4. SUAS Training Process. Training requirements addressed in this instruction are designed
to outline basic requirements for a SUAS-O’s progression from IQT through MQT to MR status.
   2.4.1. SUAS-O IQT qualifies an individual in basic aircraft qualified (BAQ) operator duties
   of assigned SUAS without regard to a unit-specific mission.
   2.4.2. SUAS-O MQT qualifies or re-qualifies an operator in those specific duties required to
   perform SUAS missions assigned to a specific unit. Completion of MQT is a prerequisite for
   MR status.
   2.4.3. SUAS-O MR status is attained when an individual is fully qualified on all tasks listed
   on AF Forms 797 and 1098. These requirements are developed by the unit SUAS-I/TM in
   coordination with unit Stan/Eval section and have unit commander’s approval. Exception:

                     MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT)

4.1. Overview. Mission qualification training is required to qualify an operator to perform the
command or unit mission. UAS Group-Specific instructions prescribe minimum training
requirements to qualify individuals in unit missions. MQT begins after IQT is completed. MQT
is a unit-level program that qualifies SUAS-Os on unit-specific equipment and procedures to
prepare them for MR status. MQT programs will be developed by the unit and approved by the
MAJCOM/A3. MQT builds upon the training received in IQT and consists of academics coupled
with supervised and graded SUAS missions under varying conditions. Note: This chapter does
not apply to USAFA/ROTC/OTS cadets.
   4.1.1. Units are allowed to tailor their programs to individual operators. This is based on the
   individual’s current qualification, experience, currency, documented performance, available
   training assets, and formal training. Applicable portions of MQT may be used to create a
   requalification program for operators who have regressed from MR to specifically address
   the deficiencies that caused the regression. Newly-assigned SUAS-Os must complete at least
   one SUAS flight under the supervision of a SUAS-I.
4.2. Administration. MQT will be accomplished within the time frame specified in the AFI 11-
5 Group-specific Volumes.
   4.2.1. Individuals failing to satisfactorily complete MQT in the allotted time must have
   commander approval to continue in training. Breaks in training will be documented in the
   individual’s training record.
   4.2.2. Training will be outlined and documented on AF Form 797 or approved automated
   products and maintained in the individual’s AF Form 623 or training record.
   4.2.3. Upon completion of MQT, the SUAS-I will request a formal performance evaluation
   from a SUAS-E. Formal evaluation will be documented and maintained in the SUAS web
   application and the individual’s AF Form 623. A copy will be maintained in the SUAS
   training record when applicable.
4.3. Mission Ready (MR). An MR SUAS-O has satisfactorily completed mission qualification
training and maintains qualification and proficiency in the command or unit operational mission
and has received certification from the unit commander, designated representative, first O-5 or
equivalent in the operator’s chain of command. An MR SUAS-O is authorized to perform
unsupervised flights in approved and coordinated airspace as defined in AFI 11-502, Volume 3,
paragraph 3.4.
AFI11-502V1 26 APRIL 2012                                                                    17

                            CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT)

5.1. General. The continuation training program provides SUAS-Os with the volume,
frequency, and mix of training necessary to maintain proficiency in the assigned qualification
level. SUAS continuation training includes recurring equipment and unit-specific training
required to maintain an individual’s MR status and ability to accomplish the unit’s assigned
missions. UAS Group-Specific instructions prescribe minimum CT requirements to maintain
system proficiency. Unit commanders will document additional CT tasks deemed critical and
required for recurring training in the unit supplement to the appropriate UAS Group-Specific
instructions.
5.2. Status. A member may be assigned Mission Ready or Basic Aircraft Qualification status.
   5.2.1. Mission Ready (MR). See paragraph 4.3.
   5.2.2. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). A BAQ SUAS-O has satisfactorily completed
   IQT. The SUAS-O must perform at the minimum frequency necessary to meet the most
   recent standards set for that SUAS in the applicable UAS Group-Specific instruction.
   5.2.3. Minimum Requirements. In addition to the above, MR and BAQ members must
   have accomplished and/or maintain the following minimum requirements (NOTE: an asterisk
   [*] indicates requirement is a go/no-go item):
       5.2.3.1. *Annual physical according to AFI 48-123.
       5.2.3.2. Flight evaluation IAW AFI11-502, Volume 2, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems
       Standardization/Evaluation Program.
       5.2.3.3. Flight currency events, except special mission qualifications that do not affect
       the wartime mission.
       5.2.3.4. Annual CRM training.
5.3. Documenting Training Events/Profiles. SUAS continuation training will be documented
in the SUAS Web Application (SUASMAN) https://webapps.hurlburt.af.mil/suasmgr.
Exception: AFMC will incorporate a SUAS information management system into its own
command-wide data manager.
5.4. Failure to Complete Continuation Training Requirements. The unit SUAS-I/TM will
advise the commander on the currency status of all assigned SUAS-O/I/Es. If an individual has
lost his or her currency in a task, the unit SUAS-I/TM will make an entry in the individual’s
SUASMAN record. When requirements are not met, the commander will investigate the failure.
   5.4.1. Declare individuals Non-Mission Ready (N-MR) or non-basic aircraft qualified (N-
   BAQ) if they fail to complete periodic continuation training requirements as defined above
   and in UAS Group-Specific training requirements. The individual will be declared non-
   current by the unit commander in that task and may not perform that task unsupervised until

7.1. General. The OTS is a system wherein an approved contractor conducts Lead Command-
approved academic, simulator, and/or other designated operator training. It is only authorized
when no formal course is available.
7.2. Applicability. Guidance applies to all SUAS-Os attending formal schools using OTS
courseware and/or OTS refresher/phase training or units conducting in-unit training.
7.3. Students. Students will train on a full-time basis to ensure their training is completed in a
timely, uninterrupted manner. Students will be relieved of duties not directly related to training.
Exceptions: 1. USAFA cadets. 2. When training is conducted at home station, supervisory
personnel may continue their normal duties as instruction permits.
7.4. Course Prerequisites. Commanders are responsible to ensure OTS students complete OTS
course prerequisites prior to commencing training.
7.5. Objectives. Lesson objective descriptions, remediation procedures, specific training
evaluation criteria, administration procedures and scheduling guidelines/procedures are found in
the applicable course syllabus.
7.6. Unsatisfactory Student Progress.
   7.6.1. If a student’s progress is unsatisfactory, the OTS contractor will notify the appropriate
   government representative. Following review of the student’s record, the government
   representative will determine whether to continue or terminate training.
   7.6.2. The OTS contractor will provide written feedback to the unit commander or training
   office for students who display substandard performance.
7.7. Courseware Changes. Submit formal school courseware changes through appropriate
MAJCOM channels via the SUAS training POC to HQ AFSOC/A3OU. Submit all other
courseware changes to the MAJCOM responsible for overseeing the OTS contract.
