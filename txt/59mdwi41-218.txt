      occupational therapy equipment, and housekeeping equipment.      Documents all
      discrepancies and corrective actions taken.
3. Non-Government Owned Equipment.
   3.1. POEA.
      3.1.1. Unit personnel inspect personal hygiene appliances (such as hair dryers, curling
      irons, electric razors, etc.), and portable radios, cassette or compact disc players used in
      general care areas prior to use. Any appliance in an unsafe condition (frayed cords,
      cracked cases, etc.) shall not be permitted within the 59 MDW.
   3.2. Staff-Owned Medical Equipment: Staff-owned medical equipment is not authorized for
   use in Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center.
   3.3. Staff-owned Non-Medical Electrical Appliances. It is the responsibility of every staff
   member to ensure that electrical appliances (i.e., personal radios, tape or compact disc
   players, coffee pots, water heaters, etc.) are in a safe operating condition. Frayed cords,
   cracked cases and other apparently unsafe conditions shall not be permitted in the 59 MDW.
   Compliance will be verified through routine surveillance activities and questionable
   appliances will be brought to the attention of the unit noncommissioned officer in charge or
   officer in charge for assessment and correction. Appliances may be transported to Clinical
   Engineering for inspection if a quality determination is required.
   3.4. Vendor Owned Equipment; Rental, Leased, Loaned, User Test:
      3.4.1. Equipment owners must sign a “Statement of Understanding” (Attachment 2). The
      using activity custodian will pick up essential documents from MEMO, coordinate with
      required activities, ensure mandatory signatures are affixed to the documents and makes
      certain that Clinical Engineering inspects the item before it is used in the Medical
      Treatment Facility.
4. Incidents Involving Electromedical Equipment.
 4                                                               59MDWI41-218 30 MAY 2014


     4.1. Immediately report, by phone, any incident involving medical equipment to Clinical
     Engineering. After normal duty hours contact and report the incident to the Medical Control
     Center.
     4.2. Complete the Computerized Patient Safety Event Reporting Form. This form is located
     on the desktop of most computers in the 59 MDW. This form can also be found by going to:
     https://patientsafety.csd.disa.mil/. Record the names of all individuals involved and the
     Equipment Control Numbers of all equipment involved. Immediately notify the Patient
     Safety Office, the Risk Management Office, and the Safety Office of equipment incidents
     involving potential or actual patient injury.
     4.3. Avoid moving and/or adjusting the equipment/device; throwing away disposables
     involved (if safety permits) until maintenance personnel have a chance to investigate. Secure
     all equipment involved in an incident that might lead to a claim against the Air Force until
     cleared by Clinical Engineering and Risk Management.
     4.4. Results of the investigation and any recommended action will be reported to the area
     supervisor for inclusion in the final incident investigation report.
5. Extension Cords, Power Strips, Surge Protectors and Adapters. Must comply with
requirements of AFI 41-203.
     5.1. Extension Cords.
        5.1.1. An extension cord is an Underwriters Laboratories (UL) approved heavy-duty,
        three-conductor cord with an industrial grade or hospital grade plug at one end and a
        single or multiplex industrial grade or hospital grade receptacle at the other end. It does
        not have built-in fuse or circuit breaker protection. Clinical Engineering must evaluate
        and approve extension cords used with medical equipment.
        5.1.2. Extension cords can be used on a temporary basis, (less than 60 days) and will not
        be used permanently in place of fixed wiring or installed outlets.
        5.1.3. Extension cords used with medical equipment cords must have hospital or
        industrial grade connectors. Metallic bodied two or three blade end connectors are
        prohibited.
        5.1.4. Use of electrical extension cords will be minimized in patient care areas. In all
        circumstances, two-wire extension cords are prohibited in those areas.
        5.1.5. An extension cord will not be plugged into another extension cord or power strip.
        5.1.6. Extension cords will not be run under rugs, hung over walls, run through doorways
        or windows or other areas that may subject the wire to physical damage.
        5.1.7. Use of extension cords on heating appliances (e.g., microwaves, toaster ovens,
        industrial grade coffee pots, etc.) or high amperage major appliances (e.g., refrigerators,
        ice machines, freezers, window air-conditioning units, etc.) is prohibited.
        5.1.8. Extension cords of any type are prohibited in areas where flammables are used or
        stored.
        5.1.9. The maximum amperage rating of the extension cord must never be less than the
        appliance cord rating or exceed the electrical rating of the outlets.
59MDWI41-218 30 MAY 2014                                                                        5


   5.2. Power Strips.
       5.2.1. A power strip is a UL approved conductor cord with built-in fuse or circuit
       breaker, multiple outlets, and with an amperage rating of 15 or less amps. Power strips
       will not exceed 15 feet in total length. Clinical Engineering must evaluate and approve
       power strips used with medical equipment.
       5.2.2. The maximum amperage rating of the power strip must never be less that of the
       appliance cord rating or exceed the electrical rating of the outlets.
       5.2.3. Power strips can be used to extend power from the wall outlet to power low
       amperage computers and office equipment.
       5.2.4. Power strips will not be plugged into another power strip or extension cord.
   5.3. A surge protector is a device with built in components to protect equipment connected
   to it from excessive energy by shorting this energy to ground. Normally, they are configured
   as a power strip, but may be configured as a single or multiple outlet adapter that plugs
   directly into a wall outlet. (Most have an indicator light identifying them as surge
   protectors). Surge protectors will not be connected to patient care equipment unless required
   by the manufacturer.
   5.4. Extension cords, power strips, and surge protectors must be frequently inspected or
   evaluated by the section safety monitor and may be evaluated by Clinical Engineering
   periodically.
   5.5. Damaged or defective extension cords, power strips, surge protectors, or equipment
   power cords should be removed from service immediately.
   5.6. Use of adapters, either three to two prongs or multiple outlets, is prohibited.
   (Exception: Qualified electronics or electrical technicians assigned to Clinical Engineering
   or Civil Engineering, Wilford Hall Branch may use adapters in the performance of essential
   tests and maintenance procedures).
6. Safety Outlets.
   6.1. Where children are routinely unsupervised and outlets are easily accessible to children
   such as pediatric clinics and pediatric waiting rooms, electrical wall outlets should be of the
   "child safe, childproof" variety.
   6.2. Wet locations within six feet of power sources, i.e. electrical outlets or electrically
   powered equipment must be protected by ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlets.
7. Precautions.
   7.1. Special precautions for patients with an externalized electrical connection which
   terminates in the immediate vicinity of the heart, ESP.
   7.2. All personnel will be familiar with the safety precautions discussed in AFI 41-203.
   Particular caution must be exercised around patients being treated with an externalized
   electrical connection, one end of which is connected to, or terminates in the immediate
   vicinity of the heart.
6                                                               59MDWI41-218 30 MAY 2014


    7.3. In areas outside CCAs or when transporting, specific precautions will be taken to protect
    patients with externalized connections, such as externalized cardiac pacing wires, to the
    heart. Some specific precautions are:
       7.3.1. Use only insulated pacing leads and insulated external cardiac pacemakers.
       7.3.2. Handle pacing wire with gloves.
       7.3.3. Keep the tips of pacing wires insulated.
       7.3.4. Keep the area surrounding pacemakers dry.
       7.3.5. Advise the patient not to handle the wires.
