Part I

Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document
that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task
requirements for the physical medicine and orthotic specialties. The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career
path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training. NOTE: Civilians occupying
associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts. Both parts are used by the supervisors to plan, manage, and control training
within the career field.

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains how
everyone will use the plan. Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and
responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path. Section C associates each level with specialty
qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training, and other). Section D indicates resource
constraints. Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, facilities. Section E identifies transition training
requirements for SSgt through MSgt.

2.2. At the unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training
commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. Part II provides training guidance for all skill levels. Section A
identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references (TR) to support
training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, core task and correspondence
course requirements. Section B contains Course Objective List and training standards supervisors will use to
determine if Airmen satisfied training requirements. Section C identifies available support materials. An
example is a Qualification Training Package (QTP), which may be developed to support proficiency training.
Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support
training. Section E identifies MAJCOM-unique requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training
required for the associated qualification needs.

3. Using guidance provided in this CFETP will ensure Physical Medicine/Orthotic individuals receive effective
and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan will enable us to train today's work force
for tomorrow's jobs.

Section A - General Information

1. Purpose. This CFETP provides information necessary for the AFCFM, MFMs, commanders, training managers,
supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program. The plan
outlines the training individuals should receive to develop and progress throughout their career. This plan
identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training. Initial skills training is AFS
specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award
of the 3-skill level. For the 4J0X2 career field, initial skills training is provided by the 937th Training Group (937
TRG) at JBSA-Fort Sam Houston, TX. 4J0X2A initial skills training is provided by the 937 TRG in Wilford Hall
Ambulatory Surgical Center at JBSA-Lackland, TX. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task
qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-
skill levels. Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a
specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is
designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to perform as a physical medicine and/or
orthotic technician. Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected Airmen. Proficiency training
is additional training, either in-residence, exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to
personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has
several purposes, some are:

1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program. Also, it is
used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career.

1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends
education/training throughout each phase of an individual's career.

1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method.

1.4. Identifies major resource constraints, which impact full implementation of the desired career field training
process.

2. Uses of the CFETP. The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and
cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.

2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training based
on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP. They will also work with the
AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.

2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP's mandatory, initial, upgrade, and
proficiency requirements. OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses can satisfy identified
requirements. MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFS must be identified for inclusion into the plan and
must not duplicate existing training.

2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The lists of courses
in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.

3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority for changes and updates to the CFETP.
Also, the AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. MAJCOM
representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.

2.3. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the proficiency to be
demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task/knowledge and the career knowledge
provided by the correspondence course.

2.4. Qualitative Requirements. Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level
of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.

2.5. Documentation. Use AFTR to document all technician qualifications. Document and certify completion of
training. As a minimum, complete the following columns in Part 2 of the CFETP: Training start date (day,
month, and year), training complete date (day, month, and year), Trainee Initials, Trainer Initials, and Certifier
Initials (if applicable).

2.5.1. Transcribing to new CFETP. Transcribing documentation to a new CFETP is an administrative function,
not a reevaluation of training. Upon publication of a new CFETP, transcribe in accordance with AFI 36-2201.

2.5.2. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available, the supervisor identifies STS training
references that the trainee requires for career knowledge and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover the
mandatory items in AFI 36-2201. NOTE: Career knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC
waiver request.

                                                          17
2.5.3. Decertification and Recertification. When a supervisor determines an Airman is unqualified on a task
previously certified for his or her duty position, the supervisor deletes certification. Appropriate remarks pertaining
to the reason for decertification are entered on the AF Form 623a, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet.
Refer to AFI 36-2201. Begin recertification if required.

2.5.4. Performance Standard. Tasks are trained and qualified to the “Go” level.

2.6. The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System.
Senior Noncommissioned Officers with extensive practical experience in their career fields develop Specialty
Knowledge Tests (SKTs) at the United States Air Force Occupational Measurement Squadron. The tests sample
knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion
to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions Reference and
Requirements Catalog.

2.7. The need dates for the CDCs are established as follows:

     7-Level CDC, 4J072, need date is 1 Jan 15
     5-Level CDC, 4J052A, need date is 8 Jun 15
     5-Level CDC, 4J052B, need date is 29 Dec 15

3. Recommendations. Identify inadequacies and recommend changes to this training standard through channels at 937
TRG/TGE, 2931 Harney Road, Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234-7674 or use the Customer Service Information Line (DSN

Explanations:

      * A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a
      level of knowledge for a specific task. (Example: b and 1b).
      ** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not
      directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks.
      - This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in
      the course or CDC.
      X This mark is used alone in course columns to show that training required but not given due to
      limitations in resources.
