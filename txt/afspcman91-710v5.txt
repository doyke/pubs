ern Range 127-1, Chapter 5, Facilities and Structures. It specifies minimum design, test, inspection, and
data requirements for the construction and modification of conventional and critical facilities and struc-
tures at AFSPC ranges, including the Eastern Range (ER) and Western Range (WR). The following major
topics are addressed: Range User responsibilities, facilities and structures design and construction site
policies, documentation requirements, conventional facilities and structures; critical facilities and struc-
tures, facility and structure emergency and critical systems test requirements, and critical facilities and
structures initial inspection requirements. All AFSPC range facilities and structures are subject to the
requirements of this publication regardless of real property accountability or ownership, including the
Department of Defense (DoD), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and commercial
users.
This volume applies to all Range Users conducting or supporting operations on the AFSPC ranges. Range
Users include any individual or organization that conducts or supports any activity on resources (land,
sea, or air) owned or controlled by AFSPC ranges. This includes such organizations as the Department of
Defense (DoD), United States (US) government agencies, civilian launch operators, and foreign govern-
ment agencies and other foreign entities that use AFSPC range facilities and test equipment; conduct pre-
launch and launch operations, including payloads to orbital insertion or impact; and/or require on-orbit or
other related support. Commercial users intending to provide launch services from one of the ranges shall
have a license or license application in process from the Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) or have a DoD sponsorship and be accepted by the DoD to use the ER or WR. For-
eign government organizations or other foreign entities shall be sponsored by an appropriate US govern-

                                            CHAPTER 1

                                         INTRODUCTION

1.1. Organization of the Volume:
   1.1.1. Main Chapters. The main chapters of this volume include common requirements for all vehi-
   cle classes. Appendixes include additional requirements to supplement the main chapters.
   1.1.2. Open Text. The open text contains the actual mandatory performance-based requirements.
   The only tailoring expected for these requirements would be the deletion of non-applicable require-
   ments. For example, solid rocket motor performance requirements would be deleted for launch sys-
   tems that do not use solid rocket motors.
   1.1.3. Bordered Paragraphs:
       1.1.3.1. Bordered paragraphs are non-mandatory and are used to identify some of the potential
       detailed technical solutions that meet the performance requirements. In addition, the bordered
       paragraphs contain lessons learned from previous applications of the performance requirement,
       where a certain design may have been found successful, or have been tried and failed to meet the
       requirement. These technical solutions are provided for the following reasons:
          1.1.3.1.1. To aid the tailoring process between Range Safety and Range Users in evaluating a
          potential system against all the performance requirements.
          1.1.3.1.2. To aid Range Safety and Range Users in implementing lessons learned.
          1.1.3.1.3. To provide benchmarks that demonstrate what Range Safety considers an accept-
          able technical solution/implementation of the performance requirement and to help convey the
          level of safety the performance requirement is intended to achieve.
       1.1.3.2. The technical solutions in the bordered paragraphs may be adopted into the tailored ver-
       sion of the requirements for a specific program when the Range User intends to use that solution
       to meet the performance requirement. At this point, they become mandatory requirements to
       obtain Range Safety approval. This process is done to:
          1.1.3.2.1. Provide an appropriate level of detail necessary for contractual efforts and to pro-
          mote efficiency in the design process.
          1.1.3.2.2. Avoid contractual misunderstandings that experience has shown often occur if an
          appropriate level of detail is not agreed to. The level of detail in the bordered paragraphs is
          necessary to avoid costly out-of-scope contractual changes and to prevent inadvertently over-
          looking a critical technical requirement.
       1.1.3.3. The Range User always has the option to propose alternatives to the bordered paragraph
       solutions. Range User proposed alternative solutions shall achieve an equivalent level of safety
       and be approved by Range Safety. After meeting these two requirements, the Range User pro-
       posed solutions become part of the tailored AFSPCMAN 91-710 for that specific program.
       1.1.3.4. Range Safety has final decision authority in determining whether Range User proposed
       detailed technical solutions meet AFSPCMAN 91-710 performance requirements.

1.2. Range User Responsibilities. Range Users are responsible for the following:
6                                                                  AFSPCMAN 91-710V5 1 JULY 2004


    1.2.1. Ensuring that all facilities and structures under their jurisdiction are designed, constructed,
    modified, and demolished in accordance with the provisions of this volume.
    1.2.2. Ensuring construction site safety.
    1.2.3. Coordinating with Bioenvironmental Engineering in the design of scrubbers and incinerators,
    hypergolic propellant vapor control foam and delivery systems, and air monitoring systems
    1.2.4. Coordinating with the Fire Marshal in the design of fire protection systems and conduct of fire
    protection activities.
    1.2.5. Assisting in the preparation of explosive site plans.
    1.2.6. Coordinating with and supporting Operations Safety in carrying out operations safety required
    inspections.

                                               CHAPTER 2

     FACILITIES AND STRUCTURES DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION SITE POLICIES

2.1. Design, Construction, and Modification Policy. All facilities and structures designed, constructed,
and modified for use on the ranges shall meet the standards and provisions established in Volumes 3 and
5 of this publication and in other nationally recognized codes and standards, including applicable state
regulations.

2.2. Location Planning Requirement. During the planning phase for construction or modification of
facilities, the following requirements shall be taken into consideration:
   2.2.1. The safety impact of the new facility operations to existing and planned nearby facilities, mili-
   tary installation and industrial complex areas, and off-base population centers as well as the impact of
   existing and planned nearby facilities on the new facility operations shall be addressed.
   2.2.2. Facilities shall not be located inside an existing explosive safety clear zone unless the facility is
   related to the existing explosive-sited facility.
   2.2.3. Overflight hazards to the facility and facility contents shall be addressed during facility siting
   and design, and critical facilities should not be located immediately downrange of existing launch
   sites.
   2.2.4. Location of facilities shall address the operational impact from hypergolic transfer and storage
   operation in nearby facilities.
   2.2.5. Location of facilities that may contain hypergolic commodities shall address Toxic Hazard
   Corridors (THC) (see Volume 6) and the potential impact on the general public and nearby facilities.
   2.2.6. Location of facilities shall take into account any radio frequency (RF) hazards and the potential
   impact on the general public and nearby facilities.

2.3. Construction Site Safety Policy. With the exception of 2.3.4 below, construction site safety shall
be the sole responsibility of the Range User or contractor when the construction contract is issued by one
of the following:
   2.3.1. The United States Army Corps of Engineers.
   2.3.2. A Range User or contractor where the accountability of an AFSPC facility or work area is
   transferred to another Range User or contractor for construction and modification purposes.
   2.3.3. A United States Department of Transportation (DOT) commercial contractor or other
   non-United States Air Force (USAF) agencies, such as the NASA, involved in construction activities
   on their own accountable facilities and launch complexes.
   2.3.4. Range Safety reserves the authority to impose a hold (stop work) when unsafe conditions exist
   that may endanger the public or Air Force-owned high value equipment or flight hardware. Range
   Safety assumes no liability or responsibility for construction site safety.
   2.3.5. Compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration Regulations. Construction

        5.1.5.1. Installation in Hazardous (Classified) Locations:
            5.1.5.1.1. Definition of Hazardous (Classified) Locations. Hazardous (Classified) locations
            are defined in Article 500 of the NEC, Hazardous (Classified) Locations.
            5.1.5.1.2. Explosives and Propellants Not Covered in NEC Article 500. For range instal-
            lations, the following paragraphs define the minimum requirements to be applied in the defini-
            tions of locations in which explosives, pyrotechnics, or propellants are present or are expected
            to be present. These requirements shall be followed unless less stringent classifications are jus-
            tified and approved as part of the design data submittal process. Range Safety and the Fire
            Marshal shall approve all potential critical facility hazardous location designations. (See
            Attachment 3 in Volume 3 of this publication for a flowpath for classifying hazardous areas.)
               5.1.5.1.2.1. Class I, Division 1. Complete definitions of classified locations are found in
               NFPA 70. These include the following locations:
                   5.1.5.1.2.1.1. Within 25 feet of any vent opening unless the discharge is normally
                   incinerated or scrubbed to nonflammable conditions [less than 25 percent of Lower
                   Explosive Limit (LEL)]. This distance may be increased if the vent flow rate creates a
                   flammability concern at a distance greater than 25 feet.
                   5.1.5.1.2.1.2. Below grade locations in a Class II, Division 1 area.
                   5.1.5.1.2.1.3. Locations in which flammable liquids, vapors, or gases may be present
                   in the air during normal operations.
               5.1.5.1.2.2. Class II, Division 1. Complete definitions of classified locations are found in
               NFPA 70.


 Class II, Division 1 usually includes locations where volatile flammable liquids or flammable gases or
 vapors are used but, in the judgment of Range Safety and the Fire Marshal, would become hazardous
 only in case of an accident or of some unusual operating condition. The quantity of flammable material
 that might escape in case of an accident, the adequacy of ventilating equipment, and the total area
 involved are all factors that merit consideration in determining the classification and extent of each
 location.

                   5.1.5.1.2.2.1. Piping without valves, checks, meters, and similar devices shall not
