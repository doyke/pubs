AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11, is supplemented as follows: This supplement pre-
scribes specific guidance for all McGuire AFB supply users/customers.
11.3.1.1. (Added) Aircraft Parts Store (APS) is located in Bldg 3209. Personnel assigned will accept pri-
ority and routine issue requests for AMXS flight line support, Isochronal Dock (ISO) Refurbishment, and
Transient Alert, regardless of the delivery priority. A GO81 terminal will be located within the ISO Dock
(Bldg 3210), and will be used by assigned maintenance personnel to process “fill” or “kill” issue requests
for required items. All zero balance conditions will be called into the Parts Store for subsequent research,
backorder verification, and final processing actions. The Parts Store reject monitor will contact the ISO
Dock daily and coordinate any necessary clear card input actions, as a part of the overall reject manage-
ment program for the element. The Parts Store will handle Tail Number Bin responsibilities for the main-
tenance complex.
11.3.2.2. Requests will be submitted to Demand Processing.
11.4.1.1. Maintain completed AF Forms 2005, Issue/Turn-In Request, page 1, for 45 calendar days after
date of request. Destroy after 45 days. Completed AF Forms 2005 are maintained by Demand Processing
and each APS.
NOTE: Use pre-serialized, AF Forms 2005, to determine the next available document serial number.
Assigned serial numbers are listed below. Any changes must be coordinated with the Procedures &
Accountability Element (LGRSP).
