                                          Chapter 1

                               GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. This AFI provides procedures for C-32B operations and applies to C-32B aircrews
   and all management levels concerned with operation of the C-32B. It is a compilation of
   information from aircraft flight manuals, Flight Information Publications (FLIP)
   publications, and other Air Force directives, as well as an original source document for many
   areas. It is written for normal and contingency operations to reduce procedural changes at
   the onset of contingencies. For those areas where this AFI is the source document, waiver
   authority will be in accordance with paragraph 1.4. of this AFI. For those areas where this
   AFI repeats information contained in other source documents, waiver authority will be in
   accordance with these source documents. When guidance in this AFI conflicts with basic
   source documents, those documents take precedence. Headquarters Air Force Special
   Operations Command (HQ AFSOC)/A3VS has responsibility for the overall administration
   of this instruction. The use of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial
   product, commodity, or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the Air
   Force.
1.2. Applicability. This AFI is applicable to all individuals, units and managers operating or
supporting ANG C-32B aircraft. It does not apply to AFRC or CAP personnel.
1.3. Key Words Explained.
   1.3.1. "Will" and "shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. "Should" is used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
   accomplishment.
   1.3.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. "NOTE" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
   emphasize.
   1.3.5. “CAUTION” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in
   damage to equipment if not carefully followed.
   1.3.6. “WARNING” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in
   personal injury or loss of life if not carefully followed.
1.4. Deviations and Waivers. Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this AFI except
when the situation demands immediate action to ensure safety.
   1.4.1. Although this publication provides guidance for aircraft operations under most
   circumstances, it is not a substitute for sound judgment. When it is necessary to protect the
   crew and aircraft from a situation not covered by this instruction and when immediate action
   is required, the Pilot In Command (PIC) has ultimate authority and responsibility for the
   course of action to be taken. Report deviations, without waiver, through channels to
   MAJCOM/A3 within 48 hours, followed by a written report, if requested. Unless otherwise
   indicated, MAJCOM/
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                 11


(Operations) A3 is the waiver authority for operational procedure requirements contained in this
volume. Request waivers through Standardization/Evaluation channels.
       1.4.1.1. For the purposes of this instruction the ―National Guard Bureau (NGB)‖ is
       considered a MAJCOM.
   1.4.2. Waiver requests will use the following waiver protocol.
       1.4.2.1. ANG Directed Missions. The ANG headquarters maintains command and
       control (C2) and waiver authority for ANG crews performing any ANG directed mission
       prior to mobilization. Waiver authority for these missions is the NGB/A3 unless
       otherwise directed by this AFI.
       1.4.2.2. AFSOC Directed Missions. Waiver authority for ANG units flying AFSOC
       missions is the HQ AFSOC/A3 unless otherwise directed by this AFI.
           1.4.2.2.1. HQ AFSOC/A3 may delegate this authority to Commander Air Force
           Special Operations Forces (COMAFSOF) for operationally assigned SOF during
           deployed/contingency operations. If the HQ AFSOC/A3 chooses to delegate waiver
           authority, it will be documented in writing and will specify which portions of this
           instruction may be waived by the COMAFSOF.
       1.4.2.2.2. When waiver authority is delegated, AFSOC/A3V will receive a copy of all
       approved waivers.
1.5. Supplements. Operations Group (OG)/CC (or equivalent) shall define local operating
procedures in a supplement to Chapter 10. OG/CC (or equivalent) shall obtain MAJCOM/A3
approval prior to releasing Chapter 10. Local supplements shall not be less restrictive than this
AFI.
1.6. Distribution. Unit commanders provide copies for all aircrew members and associated
support personnel.
1.7. Changes. Recommendations for improvement to this instruction are encouraged. Send to
150 SOS/DOV, on an AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. 150
SOS/DOV will coordinate all changes through AFSOC/A3VS and NGB/(Training) A3T.

                                           Chapter 2

                                COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The AFSOC command and control (C2) system is based on the principles of
centralized monitoring through the 623rd Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) and
decentralized control and execution. The result is a C2 mechanism which keeps the AFSOC
Commander informed of the current status of forces while enabling the wing or group
commander to exercise control over day-to-day execution of operations.
2.2. Operational Control (OPCON). AFSOC is designated as the controlling agency for
United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) assigned aircraft, while Theater
Special Operations Commands (TSOC) have OPCON of theater-based assets. In practice,
responsibility for planning and executing AFSOC missions is routinely delegated to the wing or
group commander. The wing or group commander, in turn, exercises control of non-close-hold
missions through the appropriate C2 agency. In the event that assigned/aligned forces undergo a
change in operational control (CHOP), responsibility for mission monitoring passes from the
wing or group C2 facility to the gaining command. Changeover will be accomplished in
accordance with (IAW) the pertinent Operation Plan (OPLAN), Operation Order (OPORD), or
deployment/execution order (DEPORD).
2.3. Execution Authority. Execution approval for all operational missions will be received
from the MAJCOM/C2. The 108 OG/CC (or equivalent) is the executing authority for local
training missions. The PIC has mission execution authority while operating outside
communications channels.
   2.3.1. Supplemental Training Mission (STM). Opportune airlift of cargo and mission
   personnel may be accomplished as a by-product of crew training missions. STM’s may be
   authorized when minor adjustments can be made to a scheduled training mission or when a
   productive aircrew-training mission can be generated for the airlift. The training mission will
   not be degraded in any manner to accomplish the STM. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with
   Wing/CC coordination may approve STM’s.
   2.3.2. Off Station Training Flight (OSTF). Wing/CC (or equivalent) is the approval
   authority for all off station trainers. Prior to approval, commanders will carefully review
   each proposed trainer's itinerary to ensure it justifies and represents the best avenue for
   meeting training requirements. Commanders approving off station trainers will forward a
   copy of the planned itinerary to the NGB/ A3JG (NGB Special Missions Branch) and
   AFSOC/ A3Q (AFSOC Special Missions) no later than 30 days prior to departure for training
   that will remain overnight (RON) outside U.S. jurisdiction and no later than 7 days for
   training that will RON within U.S. jurisdiction. If it is not possible to meet these lead times,
   submit itineraries as soon as possible and approval will be on a case-by-case basis.
2.4. Pilot In Command Responsibility and Authority. APIC is designated for all flights on
the flight authorizations in accordance with AFI 11-401, Flight Management and applicable
MAJCOM supplements. PICs are:
   2.4.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                    13


   2.4.2. Responsible for the welfare of the crew and passengers and the safe accomplishment
   of the mission.
   2.4.3. Vested with the authority necessary to manage crew resources and accomplish the
   mission.
   2.4.4. The final mission authority and will make decisions not specifically assigned to higher
   authority.
   2.4.5. The final authority for requesting or accepting any waivers affecting the crew or
   mission.
   2.4.6. Responsible for passing mission progress reports daily to C2 agencies. PICs must
   inform C2 agencies of factors that may impact mission accomplishment.
   2.4.7. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members, mission support personnel and
   passengers. PICs will establish a point-of-contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agency
   prior to entering crew rest.
2.5. Mission Clearance Decision. The final decision to delay a mission may be made either by
the agency with OPCON or the PIC when, in the opinion of either, conditions are not safe to start
or continue a mission. Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the PIC.
If the PIC refuses a mission, it will not depart until the conditions have been corrected or
improved so that the mission can operate safely. Another PIC and aircrew will not be alerted to
take the same mission under the same conditions.
   2.5.1. Diverting or rerouting a mission must be authorized by the commander with OPCON,
   except in an emergency or when required by enroute or terminal weather conditions or
   facilities. In the event of an emergency or weather – related divert or reroute, the mission or
   PIC must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible.
   2.5.2. The controlling authority directing the rerouting or diversion is responsible for
   ensuring destination requirements or facilities are adequate for the aircraft.
   2.5.3. The PIC will notify the controlling authority of any aircraft or aircrew limitations that
   may preclude diversion or rerouting of the mission.
   2.5.4. When directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the controlling authority will ensure
   the PIC is provided existing and forecast weather for the alternate. If the planned alternate is
   unsuitable upon arrival at destination, the controlling authority will advise the PIC of other
   suitable alternates.
2.6. Aircrew Responsibilities. The PIC is the focal point for interaction between aircrew,
mission support personnel and passengers. It is imperative that the aircrew notify the PIC of all
issues that may affect mission accomplishment. Any aircrew member is empowered to make
decisions for safety at any time, and then notify the PIC of their actions.
2.7. Operational C2 Reporting. The PIC or Airborne Mission Systems Specialist (AMSS) will
report standard aircraft movement information (departure, arrival or diversion) to the appropriate
C2 agencies. Communications Security (COMSEC) and OPORD requirements may dictate
appropriate messaging methods. The PIC will establish a point of contact with the local C2
agency (Command Post, AMC station manager, U.S. Embassy, U.S. Consulate, or FBO) before
entering crew rest.
 14                                                       AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


   2.7.1. Unusual Circumstances. Notify the appropriate C2 agencies immediately through the
   best means available of any unusual occurrence. This includes maintenance, aircraft
   malfunctions, security and operational concerns. Do not wait until arrival to send message if
   able. If information is sensitive in nature, do not use local agencies.
   2.7.2. Crew Location. Notify the appropriate C2 agencies of the aircrew location and
   contact numbers during each crew rest and any time the crew will leave the immediate
   vicinity of the airport.
2.8. Mission Commander Responsibilities. Unit Commanders or above may direct a mission
commander to act as the overall POC for the mission. The mission commander is the focal point
for complex missions and multi-sortie events. Mission commanders must inform the appropriate
C2 of any factors that may affect mission accomplishment. The unit commander delegates
primary responsibility for mission management to the mission commander. PICs remain the
final authority for all operational matters pertaining to their aircraft, crew, and mission. The
mission commander will not be a primary crew member; however the Mission Commander will
be a rated and should be a field grade officer qualified in the type mission. The mission
commander's actions include but are not limited to:
   2.8.1. Briefing crews on local operating procedures.
   2.8.2. Coordinating with ATC, passengers, and other agencies that may have an impact on
   the mission.
   2.8.3. Ensuring personnel have ample and adequate billeting, eating, and transportation
   arrangements.
   2.8.4. Ensuring maintenance personnel know of aircraft and fuel requirements.
   2.8.5. Responsible for the timely reporting of aircraft movements.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                  15

                      CREW COMPLEMENT AND MANAGEMENT

3.1. Aircrew Qualification. Primary crew members or those occupying a primary position
during flight must be qualified or in training for qualification in that crew position. If non-
current, or in training for a particular event, the crew member must be under the supervision of
an instructor while accomplishing that event. Direct supervision (at the controls) is required for
critical phases of flight.
   3.1.1. Mission ready crew members may perform primary crew duties on any sortie.
   3.1.2. Basic mission capable (BMC) crew members may perform primary duties on any
   unilateral training mission. For other missions, the unit commander will determine the
   readiness of each BMC crew member to perform primary crew duties.
3.2. Pilots. Unit CC/Director of Operations (DO) shall designate a PIC and form aircrews with
a sufficient number of pilots to accomplish the mission. The PIC shall be qualified to perform all
duties as a primary aircrew member. An instructor pilot (IP) must supervise non-current or
unqualified pilots regaining currency or qualification. Comply with the requirements for pilots in
dual controlled aircraft in AFI 11401, Aviation Management.
   3.2.1. Missions with Passengers. Pilots must have a current and valid AF Form 8 for the C-
   32B to fly with passengers. Only a pilot that is qualified will occupy a pilot’s seat with
   passengers onboard the aircraft (N/A unit maintenance personnel). One of the following is a
   requisite for pilots to fly passengers:
       3.2.1.1. Two qualified and current pilots (1 PIC or higher) must be at the controls.
       3.2.1.2. A qualified pilot non-current less than 60 days for flying requirements and an IP
       providing direct supervision. EXCEPTION: Pilots non-current in an overseas sortie can
       fly under the supervision of another pilot current in overseas requirements.
       3.2.1.3. A C-32B qualified General Officer or senior staff members may occupy either
       pilot seat under direct IP supervision. Refer to AFI 11-2C-32B V1 for supervisory flying
       restrictions.
   3.2.2. Qualification Training. Initial qualification, re-qualification, or upgrade training for
   pilots will not be conducted on missions with passengers onboard.
3.3. Airborne Mission System Specialists (AMSS) and Loadmasters (LM).
   3.3.1. AMSS or LM that are non-current or unqualified may perform duties in their primary
   crew position on any sortie when under direct supervision of a qualified instructor or flight
   examiner in their respective crew position. In this case, the student crew member and the
   instructor or flight examiner fulfills the requirement for one primary position as specified in
   Table 3.1 of this AFI. EXCEPTION: AMSS or LM that are non-current for an overseas
   sortie may perform duties in their primary crew position under the supervision of a current
   aircrew member in the same crew position.

NOTES:

1. A LM is only required when passengers or patients are carried.

EXCEPTION: Unit assigned military/civilian maintenance personnel do not require a LM. One
LM is required if 40 or fewer passengers are carried. Two LM are required for more than 40
passengers. If available, the second AMSS may augment as the second LM, within the Flt Duty
Period (FDP) limitations and with unit CC/DO approval.

2. Augmented Crew. Only one LM is required when passengers or patients are not carried. One
PIC may be first pilot (MC (P)) qualified provided no Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR) is planned or
accomplished.

3. Augmented AAR Crew. Required if any AAR events are planned after 14 hours FDP.
Requires two AAR qualified PICs.

4. Alert Crew. All pilots will be mission qualified and at least two pilots must be AAR qualified
PIC. All LM and AMSS must be mission qualified.

5. An AMSS is not required for local area training missions but may be a primary crew member
to accomplish appropriate training/currency requirements. A 2.5 hour equal time point (ETP)
constitutes the local area for training.



3.5. Additional Crew Members (ACM). ACM status is granted to qualified aircrew members
being transported on an aircraft that they will not perform in-flight duties on that mission or
succeeding legs of the mission. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the
mission being flown grants ACM status. EXCEPTION: Unit commanders may authorize ACM
status to personnel assigned or attached to the unit.
   3.5.1. ACM status will not be granted to personnel while on leave status.
   3.5.2. All ACMs require Temporary Duty (TDY) travel orders to specify ACM authorized or
   a supporting letter from their commander authorizing ACM status. Unit commanders
   authorize ACM status for their aircrew by placing a remark on their TDY orders or a letter
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                 17


   stating why the member is traveling as an ACM. Aircrew must be eligible and familiar with
   the policies and procedures governing ACM travel.
   3.5.3. Unit members wanting to travel in ACM status on non unit aircraft will have to
   coordinate with the PIC in charge of that aircraft/mission. Members use their TDY orders
   (with ACM in the remarks) to show their aircrew member/travel status.
   3.5.4. Logging of Flying Time. ACMs transported that are not C-32B qualified will be listed
   on the flight authorization in the Remarks section (only); they will not be listed on the AFTO
   Form 781. C-32B aircrew members who are current and qualified on the mission may be
   placed in the aircrew section of the flight authorization. Flight examiners, HHQ personnel
   and flight surgeons log flying time IAW AFI 11-401, Flight Management.
   3.5.5. Briefings. The PIC or representative will brief all ACMs on emergency procedures
   and egress.
   3.5.6. In order to accommodate training objectives or mission requirements, pilots (including
   non-current or unqualified pilots) who are authorized to obtain and maintain qualification in
   the C-32B may occupy a pilot's seat for purposes of conducting training or accomplishing
   mission requirements when ACMs are on board the aircraft.
3.6. Interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs (or equivalent) to permit
current and qualified aircrew members from one unit to perform primary aircrew duties on
another unit’s aircraft. NGB/A3 must approve interfly with active duty crews. Participating
aircrews shall use guidelines established by the MAJCOM or as specified in the OPLAN or
CONOPS. Conduct interfly operations as follows:
   3.6.1. OG/CC (or equivalent) may authorize interfly of aircrews and/or aircraft. Normally
   interfly should be limited to specific operations, exercises, or special circumstances but may
   be used to relieve short-term qualified manpower shortfalls.                Long-term interfly
   arrangements may be found in command-to-command memorandum of agreements (MOA)
   or letters of agreement (LOA). HQ AFSOC staff evaluation or inspection teams have
   existing interfly arrangements.
   3.6.2. Interfly is authorized under the following conditions:
       3.6.2.1. Aircraft ownership is not transferred.
       3.6.2.2. Aircrew shall be current and qualified in the Mission Design Series (MDS) as
       well as unique systems or configuration required to fly the aircraft/mission.
       3.6.2.3. Aircrew members will follow operational procedures established by this
       regulation for operating the C-32B. The Mission Commander or PIC will brief
       MAJCOM specific items.
       3.6.2.4. Initiate interfly approval request by the unit or agency requesting the agreement
       by memo or message format to the OG/CC (or equivalent) controlling the resource. Each
       OG/CC (or equivalent) with resources (personnel or aircraft) and MAJCOM, if
       appropriate, must concur with the intention to interfly.
       3.6.2.5. Request must include details of the deployment or mission including aircrew
       names, duration or special circumstances.

      3.6.2.6. Flight Mishap accountability will be in accordance with current instructions and
      regulations.
      3.6.2.7. Ground Mishap accountability IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and
      Reports.
3.7. Scheduling Restrictions (See AFI 11-202V3). Unit CC/DO shall not schedule an aircrew
member to fly nor will they perform aircrew duties:
   3.7.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3,
   General Flight Rules.
   3.7.2. After consuming alcoholic beverages within 12 hours of takeoff or when under the
   influence of alcohol.
   3.7.3. Within 12 hours following a hypobaric (altitude) chamber flight above 25,000 feet.
   Aircrew members may fly as passengers during this period provided the mission is planned
   for no more than a 10,000 foot MSL cabin altitude. An aircrew member who participates in
   an altitude chamber flight at or below 25,000 feet may fly without delay (primary/deadhead)
   as long as subsequent cabin altitude does not exceed 15,000 feet.
   3.7.4. Within 24 hours after compressed gas diving (scuba or surface supplied diving), a
   hypobaric (compression) chamber mission, or aircraft pressurization checks that exceed 10
   minutes. Aircrew members will not perform multiple pressurization checks.
   3.7.5. Within 72 hours of donating blood. Aircrew members in mobility positions or subject
   to flying duties within 72 hours may donate blood with unit CC approval (donation requires a
   72 hour duty not including flying (DNIF) period).
   3.7.6. When taking oral/injected medication unless the Command Surgeon grants an
   individual medical waiver. Except as noted in AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and
   Standard, aircrew members will not self-medicate. An aircrew member may use the
   following medications without medical consultation as long as he/she understands the root
   cause of the ailment and that root cause will not impact flight duties:
      3.7.6.1. Skin antiseptic, topical anti-fungal, 1 percent Hydrocortisone cream, or benzyl
      peroxide for minor wounds and skin diseases which do not interfere with the performance
      of flying duties or wear of personal equipment.
      3.7.6.2. Single dose of over-the-counter aspirin, acetaminophen or ibuprofen to provide
      analgesia for minor self-limiting conditions that do not impede performance of aircrew
      duties.
      3.7.6.3. Antacid for mild isolated episodes of indigestion.
      3.7.6.4. Hemorrhoid suppositories.
      3.7.6.5. Bismuth subsalicylate for mild cases of diarrhea.
      3.7.6.6. Aircrew may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays should an
      unexpected ear or sinus block occur during flight. These will not be used to treat
      symptoms of head congestion existing prior to flight.
      3.7.6.7. For fatigue countermeasures refer to AFI 11-203V3, Chapter 9 (as
      supplemented).
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                 19


3.8. Crew Rest. In addition to AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 9 and applicable MAJCOM
supplements, comply with the following guidance.
  3.8.1. Do not give crew members less than 12 hours crew rest without OG/CC (or
  equivalent) approval. Under unusual circumstances, it is permissible for crew members not
  previously placed in crew rest to fly if they state they are sufficiently rested. Notify the
  OG/CC (or equivalent) after the change in crew members has occurred. EXCEPTION:
  Crew members that state they are sufficiently rested and volunteer to fly may be scheduled
  with no prior notification. This exception applies only to local area training flights during
  normal duty hours. Unit CC/DO is the approval for this exception.
  3.8.2. Crew members departing on missions scheduled to recover away from home station
  should be notified 24 hours before reporting for a mission. The first 12 hours are not
  considered crew rest. During these first 12 hours, a crew member may perform limited non-
  flying duties. The second 12 hour period is inviolate. For short-notice mission tasking or
  when a scheduled crew member is unable to fly, crew members may be given less than 24
  hours notification with unit CC/DO approval; however, they will not be given less than 12
  hours.
     3.8.2.1. For all other missions, crew members will enter crew rest 12 hours before
     reporting for the mission.
  3.8.3. Standby crews will be given 12 hours crew rest prior to the earliest anticipated show
  time.
  3.8.4. En route Crew Rest and Ground Time.
     3.8.4.1. Crew rest normally begins 45 minutes after final engine shutdown. The 45
     minute time period provides crews with time to complete normal post-flight duties.
     These duties include, but are not limited to, refueling, uploading and downloading of
     cargo, performing maintenance, or completing mission debriefings.
     3.8.4.2. If any primary aircrew member must stay at the aircraft past the 45 minute
     period, crew rest does not begin until post-flight duties are completed.
     3.8.4.3. Minimum crew rest period is 12 hours. This period provides the crew a
     minimum of 10 hours of continuous restful activities including the opportunity for 8
     hours of uninterrupted sleep during the 12 hours prior to the start of the FDP. If crew rest
     is interrupted so the individual cannot get an opportunity for at least 8 hours of
     uninterrupted sleep the individual must be afforded the opportunity for at least 8 more
     hours of uninterrupted sleep plus reasonable time to dress, eat, travel etc. Any crew rest
     interruptions must be made under the most exceptional circumstances. NOTE: Refer to
     AFI 11-202V3 (as supplemented) for MAJCOM exceptions when en route crew rest
     times will be less than 12 hours.
     3.8.4.4. A minimum 17 hour ground time between engine shutdown and subsequent
     mission takeoff should normally be planned unless extended post flight duties are
     anticipated. NOTE: Flight crews should be afforded crew rest times in excess of the
     minimum at en route stations, when possible, to give crews the opportunity to overcome
     the cumulative effects of fatigue while flying on several consecutive days or transiting
     several time zones.
 20                                                        AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


       3.8.4.5. The PIC may modify normal ground time:
       3.8.4.6. In the interest of safety.
       3.8.4.7. To no less than 12 hours from the start of crew rest until mission reporting.
       Before reducing normal ground time consider mission preparation time, time to load
       cargo, and other factors particular to the mission. The controlling C2 agency will not ask
       the PIC to accept less than a normal ground time except in the interest of aircrew/aircraft
       safety or unusual mission requirements during contingency operations.
   3.8.5. Maintenance personnel are responsible to the PIC. The PIC will determine how long
   maintenance personnel can safely perform aircraft recovery actions. Maintenance personnel
   must have the opportunity to sleep 8 hours of each 24 hour period.
   3.8.6. Postmission crew rest (PMCR) begins upon the final return of an individual to home
   station and runs continuously until completed. PMCR must be completed before starting the
   12 hour predeparture crew rest period for a subsequent mission. A crew member cannot be
   required to get immunizations, engage in ground training, perform standby or unit duties, or
   perform any other activity that would encroach upon crew rest. Waiver authority for
   postmission crew rest is the OG/CC (or equivalent). Waiver requests for postmission crew
   rest are considered on a case by case basis only with the concurrence of the individual crew
   member. For missions exceeding 16 hours CDT, 1 hour of postmission crew rest will be
   provided for every 3 hours away from home station not to exceed 96 hours. This is not
   applicable for missions scheduled to transit home station as part of a scheduled continuing
   mission.
3.9. Flight Duty Period (FDP). FDP starts when an aircrew reports for a mission, briefing, or
other official duty (show time) and ends when engines are shut down at the end of the mission,
mission leg, or a series of missions. Show time for home station departures is established in
Chapter 10 of this regulation. For missions originating away from home station, FDP begins
when transportation departs overnight lodging. When crewmembers perform other official
duties prior to fight related duties, FDP begins when reporting for the earlier duties. NOTE:
Waiver authority for Paragraph 3.9 is the OG/CC (or equivalent) or individuals designated
Commander Air Force Special Operations Forces (COMAFSOF).
   3.9.1. Maximum FDP.
       3.9.1.1. The basic FDP is 16 hours providing no mission events, pilot proficiency
       training or functional check flights (FCF) are accomplished after 12 hours and no AAR is
       accomplished after 14 hours. EXCEPTION: If the autopilot is not operational or its use
       is denied for more than 4 hours (the use of altitude hold does not constitute use of the
       autopilot) the FDP will be 12 hours. If the autopilot fails after departure, continue to next
       scheduled stop and then comply with the basic FDP limitations.
       3.9.1.2. The augmented FDP is 24 hours providing no mission events, pilot proficiency
       training or FCFs are accomplished after 14 hours and no AAR is accomplished after 18
       hours. EXCEPTION: If the autopilot is not operational or its use is denied for more than
       8 hours (the use of altitude hold does not constitute use of the autopilot) the FDP will be
       16 hours.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                   21


       3.9.1.3. When official post-flight duties are anticipated to exceed 2 hours, consideration
       should be given to reducing FDP to ensure fatigue does not affect the safe completion of
       those duties.
       3.9.1.4. Alert/Standby Crews. For alert crews launched on an as-soon-as-possible basis,
       FDP begins when the crew is notified of the mission. For alert crews launched on other
       than an as-soon-as-possible basis, FDP begins when the crew reports for duty.
   3.9.2. Pilots in command may extend maximum FDP by up to 2 hours if the mission priority
   justifies the risk and the PIC is unable to contact the waiver authority. AFSOC/A3 and
   NGB/A3 authorizes this IAW AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 9. This extension is not to be used as
   a planning consideration. EXCEPTION: In cases where prior notice is not practical, PICs
   will report FDP extensions through their chain of command to the OG/CC or COMAFSOF
   upon landing. The intent of this exception is to allow PICs flexibility to adapt to unforeseen
   circumstances encountered during mission execution. Missions will not be planned to utilize
   this exception.
       3.9.2.1. All other FDP extensions require OG/CC (or equivalent) approval.
           3.9.2.1.1. All FDP waivers require the PIC’s concurrence.
   3.9.3. FDP length will be based on the mission to be performed. Once established, a basic
   FDP will not be changed to an augmented FDP, regardless of crew composition.
   3.9.3.1. The length of FDP will be established by the PIC or the controlling C2 agency prior
   to the aircrew entering crew rest. Once established, a basic FDP will not be extended to an
   augmented FDP unless the crew is augmented; it is requested by the PIC, and coordinated
   through the OG/CC (or equivalent).
   3.9.4. Deadhead time before performing primary crew duties is considered FDP.
   Crewmembers may perform primary crew duties after deadheading if their FDP will not
   exceed the limitations specified in Figure 3.1. Crewmembers may deadhead following
   primary crew duties. If deadheading following primary crew duties, the FDP will not exceed
   24 hours unless de-positioning to remain over night (RON)/Crew rest location or home
   station. If de-positioning to RON/Crew rest location or home station and deadheading time
   will exceed 24 hrs, SQ CC/DO approval is required. All other deadhead extensions require
   OG/CC (or equivalent) approval. NOTE: The intent is to allow the unit to complete time
   critical missions where available aircrew or aircraft are limited. Missions will not be
   routinely planned to utilize this exception.
   3.9.5. FDP for flight examiners administering flight evaluations and not occupying a primary
   crew position will not exceed the augmented FDP.
   3.9.6. If the aircraft is not capable of being airborne within four hours of scheduled departure
   time, the aircrew will be returned to crew rest or released from the flight. The unit CC/DO
   may grant exceptions at the request of the PIC. This paragraph applies to all missions,
   including unit-training missions.
3.10. Crew Changes. Crew changes should not be made immediately prior to performing
critical phases of flight for non-training flights. Normally, 30 minutes prior to initiating the
checklist for an event will allow the new crew member time to get acclimated.

3.11. Alert Procedures. Alert duty is defined as any period during which an alert crew is on
call to perform a specific mission. The unit CC/DO will determine alert procedures required for
missions. Publish unit alerting procedures in Chapter 10 of this AFI. NOTE: Alert restrictions
contained in paragraph 9.4. of the AFSOC Supplement to AFI 11-202V3 are not applicable to
150 SOS crew members.
   3.11.1. Do not give crew members less than 12 hours crew rest without OG/CC (or
   equivalent) approval. Under unusual circumstances, it is permissible for crew members not
   previously placed in crew rest to assume alert if they state they are sufficiently rested. Notify
   the OG/CC after the change in crew members has occurred.
       3.11.1.1. Pre-mission crew rest is waived for flight surgeons or medical technicians who
       are on alert duty for urgent aero-medical evacuation missions.
   3.11.2. Alert personnel are those required to be on duty for the prompt execution of the
   mission. Alert crews will be readily available in a location that allows the crew to meet the
   required time to launch from notification. Publish flight authorizations for the alert crew to
   cover the entire alert tour.
   3.11.3. The alert duty period will begin at a scheduled time that is determined by the
   unit/mission commander. The unit/mission commander will determine the length of the alert.
   EXCEPTION: Once a mission has executed, exercise or real world, there is no limitation on
   the numbers of alert duty days . The crew is tied to the mission until its completion.
   Changing crewmembers during mission execution will be at the discretion of the unit
   commander.
   3.11.4. Alert Restrictions.
       3.11.4.1. Crews may complete initial alert activities (e.g., briefings, preflights etc.)
       without starting their alert FDP.
       3.11.4.2. Alert crew members may be scheduled for mission or office related duties at
       the discretion of the alert PIC or unit commander without starting their alert FDP.
       3.11.4.3. Alert crew members will not accomplish items that may result in a DNIF or
       grounding status.
       3.11.4.4. Limit all non-flying duties on alert to a maximum of 6 hours during normal
       duty hours.
   3.11.5. Flying the alert crew.
       3.11.5.1. Flying during alert is authorized with the following restrictions:
          3.11.5.1.1. Limit flying on alert to local proficiency flights (to include AAR training)
          and relocation of the alert aircraft during daytime duty hours.
          3.11.5.1.2. Flying night sorties is prohibited while on alert.
          3.11.5.1.3. Limit FDP to six hours.
          3.11.5.1.4. Limit flying to a maximum of three sorties during a seven day alert tour.
          3.11.5.1.5. FDP for real world crisis response will begin when the crew is alerted for
          the real world mission.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                 23


  3.11.6. If the alert crew is launched and returns with FDP remaining, they may be launched
  again within the constraints of that crew day. Numerous circumstances may arise that affect
  the decision to replace the alert crew and each incident must be evaluated on an individual
  basis. The unit commander may reconstitute a new alert crew when the primary alert crew is
  launched. The new alert crew will be placed into crew rest and will not perform any duties
  for the first 12 hours. If mission objectives warrant, the new alert crew may be launched
  with less than 12 hours of pre-alert crew rest. OG/CC (or equivalent) approval is required.
  3.11.7. Provide post alert crew rest upon final return to home station for crews that sit alert
  at a location other than their normal domicile. Provide 1 hour of crew rest for every 3 hours
  on alert, not to exceed 72hours. This time off does not include the normal 12 hours or pre-
  mission crew rest required prior to assuming another alert period or flying mission.
  EXCEPTION: Post alert crew rest is not required for alert repositioning sorties (weather,
  airfield closure, etc.) accomplished within 6 hour alert FDP.

                          COMMAND OPERATING GUIDELINES

4.1. Objectives. A fully mission-capable aircraft is the ultimate objective of the logistics effort.
The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission rests with the PIC. If one
PIC accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system, this
acceptance does not commit that PIC, or a different PIC, to subsequent operations with the same
item or system inoperative.
4.2. Policy. The Minimum Equipment Listing (MEL) is the operating guidelines and lists the
equipment and systems considered essential for routine operations. Those items that state a
minimum requirement and/or have no listed exceptions are grounding items. The PIC is the
approval authority for operations with degraded equipment within the guidelines of the MEL.
Operating outside of the MEL guidelines requires OG/CC (or equivalent) approval.
EXCEPTION: For MEL items that permit flight but have extended range (ER) restrictions the
waiver authority is the unit CC/DO.
   4.2.1. For operational missions where communications with the appropriate C2 is not
   available, the PIC is the approving authority for operating outside of the MEL guidelines and
   needs no further approval.
   4.2.2. The PIC is responsible for exercising the necessary judgment to ensure aircraft are not
   dispatched with multiple items inoperative that may result in an unsafe degradation and/or an
   undue increase in crew workload. The possibility of additional failures during continued
   operation with inoperative systems or components shall also be considered. This chapter is
   not intended to allow for continued operation of the aircraft for an indefinite period with
   systems/subsystems inoperative.
4.3. Operating Guidelines. Refer to MEL.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                   25

                        AIRLAND OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. C-32B normal checklists are designed as clean up checklists, and items may be
accomplished prior to the checklist being read. A checklist is not complete until all items have
been accomplished. Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions, and
deviations specified in the flight manual, etc., are authorized.
   5.1.1. Checklist Inserts. Units may supplement Technical Order (T.O.) and commercial
   manual guidance with HQ AFSOC/A3VS approved checklist inserts. These inserts may be
   placed in an in-flight guide or at the end of the checklist. All proposed checklist inserts must
   have a POC. If any crew member has recommendations or changes they should contact the
   POC. Submit changes to operations manuals/checklists to HQ AFSOC/A3VS for final
   approval. Local in-flight guides and inserts not affecting T.O. guidance and procedures may
   be locally approved by unit DOV. NOTE: Commercial manuals are considered T.O.
   guidance. Additionally, Quick Reference/Recall Hard Cards are authorized. All changes
   will parallel procedures outlined in AFI 11-215 for Technical Orders/manuals. AF Form
   847s will be processed through HQ AFSOC for revision approval.
5.2. Duty Station. A qualified pilot will be in control of the aircraft at all times during flight.
EXCEPTION: Under direct IP supervision (at a set of flight controls), unqualified pilots in
qualification training and qualified Senior Staff Officers may occupy a pilot seat.
   5.2.1. Pilots will occupy their assigned stations from takeoff to landing except when duties
   or physiological needs require absence from their stations. Primary crew members will
   notify the PIC prior to departing and when returning to their assigned duty station.
   5.2.2. Use of the cabin jumpseats by passengers is prohibited for takeoff and landing.
5.3. Flight Deck Entry. PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight deck
during all phases of flight. In all cases, sufficient oxygen sources must be available to meet the
requirements of AFI 11-202V3. Passengers and observers will not be permitted access to the
pilot or copilot position regardless of its availability. NOTE: Passengers occupying the flight
deck jumpseats are there for visitation and familiarization. These seats will not be used as
primary seating except for unit aircrew and unit maintenance personnel.
5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy. The pilot in command will occupy either the left or right
seat during all takeoffs and landings.
   5.4.1. Instructor and flight examiner pilots may takeoff and land from either seat during any
   conditions.
   5.4.2. Any pilot may takeoff or land from either seat provided that an instructor pilot,
   instructor pilot candidate on initial or re-qualification instructor evaluation, or flight
   examiner pilot is in the other seat.
   5.4.3. With no IP/Evaluator Pilot (EP) on board PICs will accomplish all takeoffs,
   approaches and landings from the left seat when:
       5.4.3.1. Actual emergency conditions exist, unless specific conditions prevent
       compliance.
 26                                                       AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


       5.4.3.2. Making an actual Instrument Landing System (ILS) Category II or an ILS PRM
       approach.
       5.4.3.3. Hostile conditions exist.
       5.4.3.4. Operating to or from airfields requiring MAJCOM, OG/CC (or equivalent) or
       airfield related waivers.
5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operation In-Flight:
   5.5.1. The landing gear will normally be operated by the pilot not flying (PNF). Actuate the
   landing gear only after commanded by the pilot flying (PF). Prior to actuation of the landing
   gear, the PNF will acknowledge the command by repeating it.
   5.5.2. The flaps will normally be operated by the PNF. Actuate the flaps only after
   command by the PF. Prior to actuation of the flaps; the PNF will acknowledge the command
   by repeating it.
5.6. Use of Outside Observers. When available, use a crew member to assist in outside
clearing during arrivals, departures and taxi operations.
5.7. Seat Belts:
   5.7.1. Crew members occupying primary crew positions will have seat belts fastened at all
   times in-flight, unless crew duties dictate otherwise.
   5.7.2. All crew members will be seated with seat belts and shoulder harnesses (if applicable)
   fastened during takeoff, landing, and AAR operations, unless crew duties dictate otherwise.
   Crew members performing instructor or flight examiner duties are exempt from seat belt
   requirements unless they occupy a primary crew station; however, a seat with an operable
   seat belt will be available.
   5.7.3. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt. Use of seat belts will be as
   directed by the PIC and the flight manual.
5.8. Aircraft Lighting: Aircraft lighting will be in accordance with AFI 11-202V3, and this
AFI.
   5.8.1. Use taxi lights (as installed) during all taxi operations. Use landing lights/runway
   turnoff lights at night in unlighted areas. Use all external lighting any time the aircraft is
   below 18,000 feet unless reflections cause pilot distractions in instrument conditions.
   5.8.2. Anti-collision lights must be on from takeoff to landing. The PIC may turn off anti-
   collision lights when it is in the best interest of safety to do so. AFI 11-202V3 allows for
   continuation of the mission with the failure of any light in the anti-collision light system to
   the first stop where repairs can be made. Refer to the aircraft MEL for operations with
   inoperative anti-collision lights.
5.9. Portable Electronic Devices. Comply with AFI 11-202V3 as supplemented.
5.10. Smoking Restrictions. Smoking is prohibited on board Department of Defense (DoD)
aircraft per AFI 40-102, Tobacco use in the Air Force.
5.11. Advisory Calls. Mandatory advisory calls are IAW the Flight Crew Operations Manuals
(FCOM) Volume 1 and the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                    27


5.12. Communications Policy:
   5.12.1. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and
   mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, and any flight below 10,000
   feet MSL (except cruise).
   5.12.2. Communications During Takeoff. If an unsafe condition occurs during takeoff and
   before the computed V1 speed is reached, either pilot observing the condition will give a
   brief description of the problem. The PIC will then make the decision to reject or continue
   the takeoff. If a reject decision is made, the PIC will state ―REJECT‖ and the PF will
   discontinue the takeoff in accordance with the C-32B flight manuals. Non-cockpit crew
   members noting a safety of flight condition will notify the PIC by giving a brief description
   of the problem; the decision to reject or continue the takeoff will be made by the PIC.
   NOTE: PIC expectations in the event of a rejected take-off (RTO) should be covered during
   the ―Takeoff Briefing.‖
   5.12.3. Aircraft Interphone. Pilots and AMSS should monitor aircraft interphone at all
   times. Loadmasters are required to monitor interphone during AAR events or as directed by
   the PIC. Primary crew members will notify the PIC before going off headset and advise
   when back on headset.
   5.12.4. Classified interphone or radio transmissions will be recorded on the cockpit voice
   recorder if it is operating. Ensure the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) tape is erased after each
   flight when classified was discussed.
   5.12.5. Do not discuss classified information on the interphone during radio transmissions.
   5.12.6. Passengers will monitor interphone or radio transmissions only when specifically
   approved by the PIC. The PIC/AMSS will brief communications policy to these personnel
   prior to flight. The PIC/AMSS must ensure no one monitors classified information they are
   not cleared for, or transmits classified information via non-secure communications.
   5.12.7. Command Radios. The PNF normally makes all radio calls. The pilot operating the
   command radios will inform the crew when the primary radio is changed.
   5.12.8. A flight deck crew member will monitor guard regardless of primary radio.
   EXCEPTION: AAR radio usage will be as briefed and in accordance with Chapter 8 of this
   AFI.
   5.12.9. A pilot will inform the crew when the aircraft is in an other than a normal
   configuration (for example, one engine inoperative). Not required on training sorties.
   5.12.10. One pilot should record and will acknowledge all air traffic control (ATC)
   clearances. The AMSS, when available, will also record and monitor the read-back. This
   includes all transmissions pertaining to ATC instructions involving departure, en route, and
   approach procedures. Disregard this procedure when ATC instructions require immediate
   execution or when such action interferes with completion of more important duties or
   physiological needs.
   5.12.11. The AMSS will be utilized to provide communications with base operations, fixed
   based operators, and other ground personnel.
 28                                                           AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


   5.12.12. The pilot not flying the aircraft will notify the other pilot when altitude deviates 100
   feet from the desired altitude if no attempt is being made to correct the deviation. Any crew
   member seeing a variation of more than 200 feet from planned altitude or potential terrain or
   obstruction clearance problems will notify the pilot immediately.
   5.12.13. Crew Resource Management (CRM) Assertive Statement ―Time Out":
       5.12.13.1. "Time Out" is the common assertive statement for use by all crew members.
       The use of "Time Out" will:
       5.12.13.2. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness.
       5.12.13.3. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
       5.12.13.4. Notify all crew members that someone sees the aircraft or crew departing
       from established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply
       uncomfortable with the developing conditions.
       5.12.13.5. As soon as possible after a "Time Out" has been called, the aircrew will take
       the following actions:
       5.12.13.6. Safety permitting stabilize the aircraft.
       5.12.13.7. The initiating crew member will voice his or her concerns to the crew.
       5.12.13.8. The PIC will provide all other crew members with the opportunity to voice
       inputs relative to the stated concerns.
       5.12.13.9. After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the aircrew to continue the
       current course of action or direct a new course of action. NOTE: The PIC is the final
       decision authority.
5.13. Transportation of Military Working Dogs. Transporting military working dogs on
aircraft will be coordinated through unit OG/CC (or equivalent) for approval with C2 agencies.
Other pets or animals are normally prohibited, but may be moved according to DoD 4515.13R,
Air Transport Eligibility.
5.14. Alcoholic Beverages. MAJCOM/A3 may authorize the dispensing of alcoholic beverages
to passengers.
5.15. Runway, Taxiway and Airfield Requirements.

Table 5.1. Minimum Runway Length.
      Minimum Runway Length (Normal)               Minimum Runway Length (Touch and Go)
                5,000 Feet                                     7,000 Feet
               1,525 Meters                                   2,134 Meters
   5.15.1. Normal Operations (takeoff). MAJCOM approved, computer generated airfield
   analysis will be used to the maximum extent possible for determining takeoff data. If airfield
   analysis is not available, use the Flight Planning and Performance Manual (FPPM) or the
   Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) to determine the AFM runway length required for
   takeoff.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                            29


       5.15.1.1. Do not attempt takeoff if the runway available is less than the greater value of
       the AFM required runway length or 5,000 feet.
   5.15.2. Normal Operations (landing). Use MAJCOM approved computer generated landing
   data or the FPPM/QRH to determine the AFM runway length required for landing. When
   using unfactored data a 15% safety margin will be added (N/A for emergency aircraft).
       5.15.2.1. Do not attempt landing if the runway available is less than the greater value of
       AFM runway length required for landing + 15% (for the runway conditions that exist or
       are anticipated at the estimated time of arrival (ETA) or 5,000 feet. NOTE: The
       ―Normal Configuration Landing Distance‖ chart from the FPPM/QRH should be used to
       determine the AFM runway length required. (N/A for computer generated data).
   5.15.3. Waiver Authority: If operationally necessary, the OG/CC (or equivalent) may
   approve use of runways shorter than 5,000 feet, but never less than AFM takeoff and landing
   distance. Approval requires careful evaluation of aircraft and crew capabilities. If operations
   are approved, a current and qualified PIC, instructor or flight examiner will make the takeoff
   and/or landing from the left seat.
   5.15.4. If takeoff/departure end overruns are available, (stressed or authorized for normal
   operations), they may be used to increase the runway available for takeoff/landing if needed.

NOTES:

1. Use of runways between 148 and 98 feet wide requires OG/CC (or equivalent) waiver.
Runway width may not be waived to less than 98 feet (30 meters).

2. Taxiways less than 75 feet (23 meters) wide should be given additional consideration in
premission planning ORM and must be covered in the aircrew briefing prior to arrival.

3. Use of taxiways between 59 and 49 feet wide requires notification to the OG/CC (or
equivalent) prior to arrival at the airfield. If prior notification is not possible, notify as soon as
practical. Taxiway width may not be waived to less than 49 feet (15 meters).

4. C-32B aircraft require fillets when turning from one 50 foot wide taxiway to another 50 foot
wide taxiway. Turning from one 50 foot to another 50 foot without fillets is prohibited due to
the probability of the aircraft departing the paved surface.

   5.15.5. Takeoff or Landing Over Raised Arresting Cables. The following guidance covers
   BAK 9, 12, and 13 (Navy designation E-28) arresting cables, it does not include BAK 14
   recessed arresting cables:

        5.15.5.1. Do not land on a raised arresting cable, damage may occur to the cable or
        aircraft.
        5.15.5.2. If the aircraft lands before a raised arresting cable and rolls over it, the flight
        crew should contact the tower to have the cable inspected (This does not include rolling
        over a cable at normal taxi speeds).
        5.15.5.3. Do not takeoff or land over a raised arresting cable that has been reported as
        slack, loose, or improperly rigged by Notices to Airmen (NOTAM), Automated Terminal
        Information Service (ATIS), ATC, etc.
   5.15.6. Aircrews, mission planners and mission C2 will use the AMC Airfield Suitability
   and Analysis Branch for all questions pertaining to airfield weight bearing and suitability
   prior to all off-station operations.
        5.15.6.1. PICs will not make an approach and landing into an airfield requiring
        certification by the Headquarters Air Mobility Command (HQ AMC) Airfield Suitability
        Report, unless they have previously operated into that airfield as a pilot, copilot, or
        observer, or have reviewed the airfield certification briefing or audio visual program (if
        available) within the last 14 days. The OG/CC (or equivalent) may waive the airfield
        certification requirement.
        5.15.6.2. Airfield suitability waivers must be approved by MAJCOM/A3.
   5.15.7. Crash, Fire, Rescue (CFR) Requirements:
        5.15.7.1. At USAF active flying bases, local base instructions determine CFR
        requirements. At other locations, if local services are not available or practical, the
        OG/CC (or equivalent) may authorize operations without CFR.
5.16. Wind Restrictions. Airfields will be considered unusable for takeoff and landing when
crosswinds (including gusts) are greater than established in Table 5.3 These limitations are valid
for all engines operating and one engine inoperative conditions.

AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                  31


NOTE: Reduce crosswind guidelines by 5 knots on wet or contaminated runways whenever
asymmetric reverse thrust is used.

NOTE: Winds are measured at 33 feet (10 m) tower height and apply for runways 148 feet
(45m) or greater in width.

NOTE: When the reported depth of contamination is less than .12 inches (3mm) consider the
runway wet for all takeoff/landing considerations.

   5.16.1. Maximum wind any direction is 50 knots for takeoff and landing.
   5.16.2. Waiver Authority: If operationally necessary, the OG/CC (or equivalent) may
   approve operations with winds up to the AFM limitations. Approval requires careful
   evaluation of aircraft and crew capabilities. If operations are approved, a current and
   qualified PIC, instructor or flight examiner will make the takeoff and/or landing from the left
   seat.
   5.16.3. For other wind restrictions refer to the Limitations section of the Flight Crew
   Operations Manual, Volume 1 and Chapter 9 of this AFI.
5.17. Runway Condition Reading (RCR).
   5.17.1. During landing on wet runways or runways contaminated with ice, snow, slush or
   standing water; crews will use pilot reports (PIREPS) and the physical description of the
   runway surface as the primary means to determine which category of ―good‖, ―medium‖, or
   ―poor‖ is appropriate when calculating the runway distance required for landing.
   5.17.2. RCR provides additional information and should be considered by the aircrew prior
   to determining runway suitability for landing. However, when using RCR, crews should
   keep in mind that there is no direct correlation between RCR and the descriptive terms
   ―good‖, ―medium‖, ―poor‖, and ―nil‖ used in pilot braking action reports. Chapter 6 of the
   Flight Crew Training Manual (FCTM) provides additional guidance on using RCR to
   evaluate braking action.
   5.17.3. The following information is provided to assist crews in making the most informed
   decision when using RCR.

Table 5.4. Braking Action vs.
Braking Action to be        Reported RCR          Reported Runway          Reported Braking

      5.17.3.1. When the RCR is reported as 5 or less or the braking action is reported as
      ―Nil‖, landing is not recommended.
      5.17.3.2. When operating on runways partially covered with snow or ice, computations
      should be based on the reported RCR for the cleared portion of the runway. To ensure
 32                                                      AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


      proper takeoff performance in the event of an engine failure, the runway should be
      cleared to allow for maximum VMCG offset (C-32B is 25 feet plus main gear offset). If
      your required VMCG offset either side of centerline is not cleared to the reported RCR,
      then the RCR of the unclear portion, up to your required offset, will be used for takeoff
      data computations. NOTE: RCR Reporting. Technical Order (TO) 33-1-23 directs that
      RCR information be obtained only within 20 feet of the runway centerline. Only the
      average RCR is reported. Many portions of the runway (laterally and longitudinally) may
      have a significantly lower RCR than the value reported.
   5.17.4. No reported runway conditions. If pilot braking action reports, RCR or RSC are not
   available, flight crews are to consider a runway surface as wet when there is sufficient water
   on the surface to cause reflective glare or when rain is falling. For runways contaminated by
   slush, standing water, snow or ice, the PIC will determine the anticipated braking action.
5.18. Aircraft Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage (FOD)
Avoidance.
   5.18.1. Without wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 25 feet. With wing
   walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 10 feet. EXCEPTION: Aircraft at home station
   may delete wing walker restriction if IAW AFI 11-218, all restrictions are complied with.
   5.18.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are
   unavailable, de-plane one or more crew members to maintain obstruction clearance and
   provide marshalling. Use AFI 11-218 signals. The PIC should use marshallers, wing
   walkers, deplaned crew members, or a crew member positioned at a door or window to act as
   an observer while maneuvering on narrow taxiways. During night taxi operations,
   marshallers should have an illuminated wand in each hand. If wands are not available, use
   flashlights, chemical lights or any other device that will be visible from the cockpit.
   Observers should be in a position to observe wing walkers at all times (through door or
   windows) and communicate to the pilot.
   5.18.3. FOD Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD.
   Crews should:
      5.18.3.1. Carefully review airfield layout during mission planning. Be familiar with taxi
      routes, turn requirements and areas for potential FOD.
      5.18.3.2. Confirm that taxi routes have been swept. If a taxi route has not been swept,
      consider taxiing via an alternate route.
      5.18.3.3. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
      5.18.3.4. If it is necessary to accomplish a 180-degree turn on a narrow runway the turn
      should be accomplished at an intersection of a link taxiway or at a designated turn around
      pad.
      5.18.3.5. Avoid (when possible) taxi operations that would position a wing mounted
      engine over an unprepared or un-swept surface. If it becomes absolutely necessary to
      position a wing mounted engine over an unprepared or un-swept surface, the engine
      should be left in idle (to the maximum extent possible) until the engine is back over an
      improved surface.
          5.18.3.5.1. Consider increasing power on the remaining engine.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                 33


5.19. Fuel Requirements. This       paragraph    implements    the   standard   minimum      fuel
requirements.
   5.19.1. As a minimum, required ramp fuel will consist of all fuel required for engine start,
   taxi, auxiliary power unit (APU) operation, takeoff, climb, cruise, en route reserves,
   alternate/missed approach (if required), descent, approach, and landing.
   5.19.2. Required fuel at destination. Plan to land at the destination with a minimum of 50
   minutes of usable fuel onboard. This amount will be computed by a MAJCOM approved
   computer flight plan (CFP). If a CFP is not available, plan to land with a minimum of 6,000
   lbs.
   5.19.3. Alternate Fuel. As a minimum, alternate fuel will include fuel for a flight from the
   intended destination to the alternate aerodrome at optimum altitude and long range cruise
   speed. When holding is required, in lieu of an alternate at a remote or island destination,
   compute holding for 2 hours. A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome,
   which, due to its unique geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military)
   within 2 hours flying time. The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must
   meet the criteria listed in chapter 6 of this AFI.
   5.19.4. Required Ramp Fuel for Extended-range Twin-engine Operational
   Performance Standards (ETOPS). Block-to-block fuel must be greater than or equal to:
   fuel required to fly to the ETP, experience a simultaneous engine failure and loss of cabin
   pressure, and proceed from the ETP to a recovery field at 10,000 feet using single engine
   cruise procedures. This amount must also include extra ETOPS fuel requirements listed in
   chapter 6 of this AFI.
5.20. Inter. The decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC.          Base
performance computations on the runway remaining at the point the takeoff is initiated.
5.21. Land and Hold Short (LAHSO) Operations. PICs shall not accept nor request LAHSO
approach clearances. Advance ATC notification may be required for proper sequencing of
aircraft and preclude delays.
5.22. Stop-and-Go Landings. Stop-and-Go landings are not authorized.
5.23. Reduced Power Operations. Reduced power operations are intended to prolong engine
service life. Takeoffs will be accomplished using reduced power unless operational or training
requirements dictate otherwise.
5.24. Engine Out Takeoffs. Engine out takeoffs require a MAJCOM/A3 waiver.
5.25. Engines Running On/Offload (ERO). Do not use ERO procedures when explosive
cargo is involved unless authorized by the exercise operation order, contingency air tasking
orders or OG/CC (or equivalent).
   5.25.1. The ERO procedures in this paragraph may be used for any mix of personnel or
   cargo. Personnel will onload or offload via the air-stairs. PICs will assess prevailing
   weather, lighting, and parking location to ensure a safe operation.
   5.25.2. General Procedures:
       5.25.2.1. PICs will brief crewmembers on the intended ERO operation, emphasizing
       specific crewmember duties.
 34                                                      AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


      5.25.2.2. The parking brake will be set and one pilot will monitor brakes, interphone, and
      radio.
      5.25.2.3. Operate engines at idle thrust.
      5.25.2.4. Turn wing illumination lights on during night ERO.
      5.25.2.5. Complete passenger and cargo manifests, crew lists and weight and balance
      form for the subsequent sortie. NOTE: If the aircraft is departing empty, the weight and
      balance form is not required.
      5.25.2.6. Resume taxi after the door warning light is out and when the loadmaster has
      verbally acknowledged that the aircraft is ready for taxiing. CAUTION: Due to hazards
      involved (i.e., jet blast, proximity to engines) only hand transferable items of cargo may
      be on or off loaded during ERO operations. CAUTION: Door 1L may be opened and
      airstairs extended with the left engine running. The PIC or designated representative
      (normally the loadmaster) must ensure the hazards involved are understood by the crew
      and passengers.
      5.25.2.7. During enplaning or deplaning, station a crew member (normally the
      loadmaster) at the bottom of the airstairs as an aircraft security and safety monitor.
      5.25.2.8. Enplaning or deplaning passengers will be escorted by a crew member. Brief
      these personnel to remain clear of hazardous areas (see aircraft flight manual). Deplane
      passengers before cargo and enplane after cargo unless cargo size, location or mission
      dictates otherwise.
      5.25.2.9. The loadmaster will direct all onload and offload operations.
      5.25.2.10. ERO for crew changes during local training missions is authorized. Keep
      ERO for crew changes to the absolute minimum necessary to accomplish the mission.
5.26. Emergency Airlift:
   5.26.1. Use these procedures for emergency airlift of personnel for humanitarian reasons or
   from areas faced with enemy siege, hostile fire, or when directed by the MAJCOM. Airlift
   can be accomplished without the use of individual seats or safety belts only when more
   personnel than seats are available.
   5.26.2. The number of personnel seated within the cabin will vary depending on individual
   size. If possible seat personnel in rows facing forward and restrain with straps placed across
   the aircraft floor. Secure the straps to tiedown rings positioned in the most outboard seat
   track(s).
   5.26.3. If time allows, personal effects or baggage may be loaded on the aircraft. However,
   this may reduce the amount of personnel space available.

     including the classified supplement. Ensure the planned itinerary can be flown in
     compliance with the provisions of the FCG. If not, obtain an exception to the FCG
     through DAO or State Department channels or coordinate an itinerary change.
     6.3.1.12. Flight Itinerary. Confirm itinerary times. Itinerary leg times are en route times
     and do not include times for taxi-out and taxi-in. Ensure forecast winds and payloads are
     accurately assessed.
     6.3.1.13. Messages. Advance notice and/or diplomatic clearance messages are required
     for all missions to destinations outside the CONUS, excluding flights to Alaska, Hawaii,
     and US territories.
     6.3.1.14. En Route Support. PICs are ultimately responsible to ensure adequate en route
     support is available for all destinations. When a mission or portion of a mission is
     canceled or changed, the PIC or unit mission planners are responsible for advising
     affected support agencies or embassies.
     6.3.1.15. Coordinate for worldwide FLIPs and ensure possession of sufficient
     communications security (COMSEC) materials for the duration of the mission.
     6.3.1.16. Review anti-hijacking procedures (AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting
     Piracy [Hijacking], and chapter 7 of this AFI).
     6.3.1.17. Parking, Servicing, and Aircraft Security Requirements. The following should
     be considered when planning missions into certain locations:
        6.3.1.17.1. Guard and Reserve Facilities. On missions to CONUS civil airports with
        a military facility (ANG/AFRC) capable of providing support, use the military
        facility; however, there are exceptions. If the mission will arrive or depart outside the
        normal operating hours of the military facility (nights, weekends, or holidays) use a
        civilian facility (terminal, FBO ramp, etc.) provided you can arrange the necessary
        support. If the using agency requests use of a civilian facility in preference to an
        available military facility, use the civilian facility. In general, avoid requiring
        ANG/AFRC units to work overtime in support of C-32B missions unless the using
        agency has a specific need to use the military facility or suitable support cannot be
        obtained from civilian sources.
        6.3.1.17.2. Contract Servicing Agents. Use the government fuel contractor unless
        you cannot obtain the required services. Government FBO contract fuel vendors can

           6.3.1.17.3. Aircraft Security. C-32B aircraft are exempt from the Global Decision
           and Support System (GDSS) requirement for RAVENS. RAVENS may be used if
           conditions warrant and requested by the unit. Aircraft security is ultimately the
           responsibility of the PIC. When using non-military fields, the PIC will work with the
           FBO, airport security or DAO directed host nation security to ensure that the aircraft
           is adequately protected. If the PIC is not satisfied that adequate aircraft security is
           available, notify the responsible C2 agency for resolution.
6.4. Aircrew Publications Requirements. Unit DOV will maintain current C-32B aircraft
flight manuals, performance manuals, abbreviated checklists, and hardcards on board the aircraft.
Aircraft FLIP will be maintained by personnel assigned by the unit commander. HQ AFSOC
authorizes E-pubs in lieu of paper manuals for all products except for approach plates, SIDs,
STARS and abbreviated checklists. Refer to Chapter 10 of this instruction for local paper/E-
pubs guidance.

Section 6B—Predeparture

6.5. Airfield Certification. All crew members will review Airport Qualification and
Familiarization Manuals, audiovisual programs (if available) and any Airfield Suitability and
Restrictions Report (ASRR) certification airfields available prior to departure. In addition,
review all restrictions for a particular airfield. Contact MAJCOM Airfield Suitability and
Analysis Branch or the Airfield Manager directly for all questions pertaining to airfield weight
bearing and suitability. Airfield suitability waivers must be coordinated through unit Stan/Eval
up to MAJCOM Stan/Eval for approval. The OG/CC (or equivalent) may waive the airfield
certification requirement.
6.6. Aircrew Intelligence Briefing. Prior to leaving home station on OCONUS missions, crews
should receive an intelligence briefing that will emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly political
and military development in the area in which they will be flying. Additionally, theater SPINS
and ATO procedures should be reviewed if applicable. Aircrews should report information of
possible intelligence value to the local intelligence officers (if available) at the completion of
each sortie. If no local intelligence personnel are available, aircrews will debrief home station
intelligence personnel at the completion of the mission.
6.7. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). Review Volume I, part A, of the FCIF before all
missions.
   6.7.1. If material has been added to the FCIF since the last review, sign off the latest FCIF
   item number in PEX (Patriot Excalibur). If PEX is inoperative, comply with locally
   developed procedures in Chapter 10 of this instruction.
   6.7.2. Crew members delinquent in FCIF review and joining a mission enroute, will receive
   an FCIF update from their primary aircrew member counterpart on that mission. Instructor
   pilots flying with general officers are responsible for briefing appropriate FCIF items.
   6.7.3. Crew members not assigned or attached to the unit will certify FCIF review by
   entering the last FCIF number and their initials beside their name on the file copy of the
   flight authorization or their ACM orders. Initials will be in pen.
   6.7.4. Units are responsible for ensuring TDY aircrews receive newly released FCIFs which
   may result in mission impact.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                  41


6.8. Mission Kits. Prior to departure, the PIC, or a designated representative, will ensure a
current mission kit is aboard the aircraft. The kit will contain, but is not limited to, the items
listed in Figure 6.1 Maintain sufficient quantities of forms and documents to cover time well in
excess of the scheduled mission length.

6.9. Briefing Requirements.
   6.9.1. Pre-Mission Briefings. Briefings should be clear, concise, and designed to provide
   only mission essential information. Supplement and shorten briefings with visual aids when
   practical. Avoid needless repetition of published procedures. Schedule briefings after
   considering the particular mission, crew rest, and other pertinent factors. Aircrew members
   must be provided all applicable information available to ensure complete and professional
   aircrew planning. Crew members will not fly unless they attend the crew briefings for their
   mission. EXCEPTIONS: When mission requirements dictate, PICs may excuse certain
   crew members from the briefing. The PIC will ensure that those personnel receive a face-to-
   face briefing prior to engine start.
       6.9.1.1. Crew members joining a mission enroute will receive a face-to-face briefing
       prior to assuming primary duties.
   6.9.2. Weather Briefings. See AFI 11-202V3 requirements. Obtain a briefing on current
   weather, trends, and forecasts for the proposed route, destination, and alternates. The
   weather briefing should be documented on a DD 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing. If military
   weather isn’t available or practical; civilian weather briefings are authorized. EXCEPTION:
   Verbal weather briefings are acceptable for local area training missions. See Chapter 10 of
   this instruction for locally developed weather briefing requirements.
       6.9.2.1. Use weather briefings from the Operational Weather Squadron (OWS)
       responsible for weather support at that location.
       6.9.2.2. No military weather services available. If crews cannot contact home station or
       OWS, crews will obtain weather through any means available to ensure required weather
       data is in their possession prior to mission accomplishment.
       6.9.2.3. Approved weather sources. Use in the following order: US Military weather
       services, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved (Jeppesen, Flight Service,
       etc.), or any host nation civil or military weather source.
   6.9.3. NOTAM information is permitted from the following sources; US Military services,
   any FAA-approved source (Jeppesen, Flight Service, etc.,), or any host nation civil or
   military source.
   6.9.4. Hazardous Cargo Briefing. Prior to acceptance of hazardous materials, the PIC or
   designated representative should be furnished a cargo briefing and appropriate forms. The
   PIC will ensure that all crew members thoroughly understand mission requirements and
   procedures governing the hazardous materials being airlifted.
   6.9.5. Pilot In Command Briefing. Give this briefing before the first flight of the mission
   and for subsequent flights when crew member substitutions are made or operating procedures
   change from the original briefing.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                 43


   6.9.6. Departure and Arrival Briefings. As a minimum the following topics need to be
   covered.
       6.9.6.1. Departure.
           6.9.6.1.1. RTO and Emergency Return.
           6.9.6.1.2. Emergency Level off Altitude and Jeppesen Special Departure Procedures
           (SDP) (if applicable).
           6.9.6.1.3. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA).
           6.9.6.1.4. Standard Instrument Departure (SID)/Departure Instructions.
           6.9.6.1.5. Any Non-standard procedures that are anticipated.
       6.9.6.2. Arrival. Conduct the arrival brief IAW the ―Normal Procedures‖ (NP) section of
       the FCOM, Volume 1.
   6.9.7. En Route Briefings. The PIC will conduct a debriefing after each mission and prior to
   entering crew rest. The debriefing will include all applicable crew members so common
   problems can be discussed and resolved. Crew members may be excused from the debrief at
   the discretion of the PIC. The PIC will also brief the crew on the requirements for the next
   mission leg. Route and leg briefings should be conducted for every leg prior to departure
   with applicable crew members or a designated representative for each crew specialty. PICs
   should keep the passenger POCs informed of mission specifics, changes, problems, etc. Use
   the following checklist as a guide for en route briefings:
       6.9.7.1. Crew contact procedures during crew rest.
       6.9.7.2. Departure time.
       6.9.7.3. Crew reporting time and place (transportation arrangements).
       6.9.7.4. Fuel load.
       6.9.7.5. Uniform changes (if applicable).
       6.9.7.6. Cabin service requirements.
   6.9.8. Passenger Briefings. The PIC or designated representative will brief passengers on all
   flights in accordance with the applicable passenger video or briefing checklist.
6.10. Call Signs. Use voice call sign listing (VCSL) or as specified in mission directives except
local training missions. Use standard call signs for local area training missions.
6.11. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent
possible without unacceptable mission degradation. EXCEPTION: On local training flights,
Visual Flight Rules (VFR), VFR terminal area procedures, and visual patterns should be
reviewed and practiced to ensure aircrew VFR flight proficiency and knowledge of VFR
procedures and rules are maintained.
   6.11.1. During VFR operations, aircraft will utilize radar advisory service to the maximum
   extent possible.
6.12. Flight Data Verification.
 44                                                      AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


   6.12.1. Computer Flight Plan (CFP) Usage. MAJCOM approved (Jetplan, Milplanner,
   Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS), (Combat)CFPS, etc) flight planning programs are
   authorized for performance, navigation, and climatic data, including en route wind
   information for C-32B aircraft. If computer flight plans are used, each mission segment
   should utilize current wind data if available.
   6.12.2. Aircrews may manually compute flight plans if a CFP is not available.
   6.12.3. Regardless of whether a flight plan is prepared by the aircrew or is furnished by
   another source, the PIC will verify routes and flight altitudes to ensure proper terrain
   clearance and hazardous weather avoidance.
   6.12.4. Aircrews will verify diplomatically-cleared routing and fuel computations for
   accuracy prior to departure.
   6.12.5. Takeoff and Landing Data. The use of a MAJCOM approved (Jeppesen, Boeing On-
   Board Performance Tool (OPT), etc.) airfield analysis program is authorized for determining
   takeoff and landing data. Speeds for takeoff and landing will be computed by tabulated data
   or the aircraft Flight Management Computer (FMC) as applicable. Takeoff and landing data
   should be independently verified by both pilots.
6.13. Departure Planning:
   6.13.1. Gross Weight. Ensure that the aircraft does not exceed the maximum gross weight,
   zero fuel weight, or center of gravity limitations specified in the AFM. Gross weight may be
   further restricted by operating conditions.
   6.13.2. For the use of Non-standard Takeoff Minimums refer to AFI 11-202V3 and
   applicable supplements.
   6.13.3. Specific ATC Departure Instructions/Climbout Performance. The aircraft must be
   able to meet or exceed the published climb gradient for the departure method being used with
   all engines operating. When no climb gradient is published, the aircraft must be able to
   climb at 200 feet per nautical mile (3.3%) or greater. For departure planning with one engine
   inoperative (OEI), refer to chapter 8 of AFI 11-202V3 as supplemented.
      6.13.3.1. Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs). OPRs for SIDs are identified on each
      individual SID. Only MAJCOM/A3, after a TERPS review, may approve a host nation
      or commercially produced SID for use in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC).
      6.13.3.2. Published IFR Departure Procedures. Published IFR Departure Procedures are
      available at some civil and military fields to assist in avoiding obstacles during climb to
      the minimum en route altitude (MEA). Aircraft will comply with AFMAN 11-217 and
      AFI 11-202V3 requirements.
      6.13.3.3. Special Departure Procedures (SDPs). HQ AFSOC authorizes the use of SDPs
      for C-32B aircraft. SDPs utilize worldwide obstacle database criteria to provide OEI
      escape routing. WARNING: SDPs may not ensure obstacle/terrain clearance if the
      aircraft is unable to comply with the specified escape routing. At airfields where
      obstacle/terrain clearance is a factor, departure procedures from liftoff to the minimum
      enroute altitude must be reviewed and included in the takeoff briefing. NOTE: Use of
      SDPs as alternate departure routing (no emergency) is not authorized.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                   45


      6.13.3.4. Specific ATC Departure Instructions (Specific Climbout Instructions or ―Radar
      Vectors‖). Crews may depart via specific ATC departure instructions.
      6.13.3.5. VFR Departures. VFR departures are authorized when required for mission
      accomplishment. The weather at takeoff must permit a VFR climb to an IFR MEA, an
      appropriate IFR cruising altitude, or an altitude where an IFR clearance can be obtained.
      NOTE: In no case will VFR departures be flown in lieu of OEI obstacle clearance
      planning or use of IFR departure procedures.
6.14. Obstacle Clearance Planning:
   6.14.1. Obstacle Identification Surface (OIS). Obstacle identification for SID purposes are
   those objects that penetrate an OIS of 40:1 (152 feet per nautical mile (NM)). Calculation of
   the OIS on a SID continues until the SID reaches a MEA or until the SID terminates. Climb
   gradients of 200 feet per NM, or published climb gradients, will provide at least 48 feet per
   NM clearance above all obstacles that do not penetrate the OIS. The PIC must be aware and
   thoroughly brief the crew on all obstacles along the departure flight path. NOTE: Civilian
   SIDs do not depict the controlling obstacle that the climb gradient is based on.
   6.14.2. MAJCOM approved computer generated Airfield Ops Data is sufficient to meet or
   exceed all obstacle clearance requirements for USAF aircraft.
   6.14.3. When Airfield Ops Data is not available, before flying any departure, the aircrew
   will:
      6.14.3.1. Use the FPPM or QRH to determine the max takeoff gross weight for the
      runway to be used for the atmospheric conditions that exist or are anticipated for the time
      of departure. Review appropriate terrain charts (if available), the ASRR, instrument
      approaches, area charts, departure plates, etc. to determine the controlling obstacle(s).
      WARNING: When using the FPPM/QRH to determine takeoff data, crews must be
      aware that there is no weight penalty to account for climb degradation during turning
      departures and it is extremely difficult to identify all obstacles that may affect the flight
      path. If terrain/obstacles are a factor, max power takeoffs and climbs should be used
      until reaching MEA.
6.15. Takeoff Minimums and Departure Alternates.
   6.15.1. Weather Minimums for Takeoff.
      6.15.1.1. Takeoff is permitted when weather is below the published ceiling but:
          6.15.1.1.1. Runway Visual Range (RVR) is 1,600 or greater (with no RVR readout
          use visibility 1/4 mile or greater) or;
          6.15.1.1.2. Approach end RVR is 1,200 or greater, departure end RVR is 1,000 or
          greater and centerline lighting is operational.
   6.15.2. When weather is below approach and landing minimums (ceiling or visibility) a
   departure alternate is required. Do not use CAT II minimums to determine if a departure
   alternate is required. In the absence of RVR readouts, reported visibility will be no lower
   than 1/2 SM.
   6.15.3. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the
   aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA or Minimum Obstruction Clearance
 46                                                       AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


   Altitude (MOCA) whichever is higher, to the alternate using one engine out performance
   criteria. To qualify as a departure alternate the airfield must meet one of the following
   conditions:
       6.15.3.1. Within 30 minutes flying time and the ceiling and visibility must be equal to or
       better than the published approach minimums or 200 and 1/2 (RVR 2,400) whichever is
       greater, and forecast to remain so until 1 hour after takeoff, or;
       6.15.3.2. Within 2 hours flying time and the weather must be at least 500-1 above the
       lowest compatible published approach minimums, but in no case lower than 700-2 for a
       precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to remain so for
       ETA plus or minus 1 hour.
   6.15.4. Airfield and Aircraft Approach Capability. For IFR departures, the approach facility
   upon which weather minimums are based must be operational at the departure and alternate
   airports and the necessary aircraft approach equipment must also be operational.
6.16. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will
be according to AFI 11-202V3 and the following:
   6.16.1. File two alternates when:
       6.16.1.1. The forecast weather is less than required minimums for the lowest compatible
       approach.
       6.16.1.2. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected
       for RCR.
   6.16.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the destination aerodrome is
   outside the 48 conterminous states.
   6.16.3. When filing to a remote or island destination, aircrews will use 2 hours of holding
   fuel (in lieu of an alternate and 50 minutes holding fuel). A remote or island destination is
   defined as any aerodrome which, due to its unique geographic location, offers no suitable
   alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time. The forecast weather at the remote or
   island destination must meet the following criteria:
       6.16.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA
       and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter.
       6.16.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published
       minimums for an available published approach (excluding radar approaches), for ETA
       plus 2 hours.
6.17. Destination and AAR Alternates.
   6.17.1. Choose alternates that best meet mission conditions and conserve fuel. When
   terminal forecasts are marginal, if possible avoid picking alternates within the same weather
   system. Selected alternates should not be restricted by FLIP, the FCG, or diplomatic
   clearances and should be compatible with the mission load. A weather alternate does not
   need to be capable of providing en route maintenance. The PIC retains final authority in the
   choice of the alternate; however, selection by support agencies should be used if the above
   criteria are met and the aircraft has already been serviced.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                   47


6.18. Adverse Weather Planning.
   6.18.1. Icing. The Air Force Weather Agency Technical Note (AFWA/TN 98/002)
   Meteorological Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing and
   freezing rain is equivalent to severe icing. Prolonged flight (cruise) in areas of forecast or
   reported severe icing (freezing rain) is prohibited.
       6.18.1.1. C-32B aircrews should use the MAJCOM approved De/Anti-Icing Hardcard
       for procedures and to establish holdover times.
   6.18.2. Thunderstorms. During flight, use any available means to avoid thunderstorms by:
       6.18.2.1. Minimum of: 20 NM at or above FL 230.
       6.18.2.2. Minimum of: 10 NM below FL 230.
   6.18.3. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.
   If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2,000 feet, you
   must avoid them by using the above criteria. NOTE: Aircraft damage may occur 20 miles
   or more from any thunderstorms. Aircrews must familiarize themselves with information on
   thunderstorm development and hazards. Refer to AFH 11-203, Weather for Aircrews.
   6.18.4. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
   departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
       6.18.4.1. Attempt to maintain Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC).
       6.18.4.2. Attempt to maintain at least 5 NM separation from heavy rain showers.
       NOTE: Approaches or departures may be accomplished with thunderstorms in the
       vicinity of the airport. The thunderstorms must not be producing any hazardous
       conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds, gusts fronts, wind shear, or microbursts)
       at the airport, and must not be forecast or observed to be moving in the direction of the
       route of flight (to include the planned missed approach corridor, if applicable).
   6.18.5. Altimeter Temperature Corrections. Aircrews performing instrument approaches and
   landings at locations where temperatures are 32°F/0°C or below will apply temperature
   corrections IAW the Flight Information Handbook and AFI 11-202V3.
   6.18.6. Turbulence. Flights into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence are
   prohibited. NOTE: Turbulence classification is specific to the size and weight of the aircraft
   experiencing the conditions. Reported severe turbulence from aircraft smaller than the C-
   32B may or may not be valid. The PIC should attempt to ascertain the source of the report
   and then use their best judgment on how to proceed. If this information is not available, the
   report must be considered valid and the restriction of 6.18.6 of this AFI applies.
       6.18.6.1. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain
       wave turbulence.
6.19. Fuel Planning. Use the CFP, FPPM or QRH for fuel planning. Flying at longrange cruise
(approx .80M) is the most conservative method, and therefore this method is encouraged.
However, PICs may elect to fly at other speeds deemed appropriate for the mission. The
―recommended‖ altitude from the FMC is the most economical based on two engines, gross
weight, target speed, forecast cruise winds and temperature. Therefore, the aircraft should be
 48                                                        AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


flown within 2,000 feet of this altitude (unless the mission dictates other altitudes). Step climbs
should be used if available.
   6.19.1. Add Extra Fuel:
       6.19.1.1. When fuel is unavailable at en route stops; when compressed ground times
       during single day multi sortie missions preclude refueling at each en route stop; or when
       en route refueling will delay or be detrimental to mission accomplishment.
       6.19.1.2. When passengers or patients are aboard, to recover at a suitable airfield from
       the ETP at 10,000 feet MSL in the event of unpressurized flight.
       6.19.1.3. When Category II operations are anticipated (total must include fuel for en
       route decent, approach, missed approach, en route fuel to alternate, and approach fuel at
       alternate).
   6.19.1.4. When required by the CFP for extended range operations.
   6.19.2. Fuel Conservation. Aircrew and mission planners will manage fuel as a limited
   commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will be considered throughout all
   phases of mission planning and execution. Excessive ramp and recovery fuel adds to aircraft
   gross weight and increases fuel consumption. Do not ferry extra fuel beyond optimum
   requirements for safe mission accomplishment and training objectives. Aircrews and mission
   planners will optimize flight plans and flight routings for fuel efficiency. In-flight
   procedures such as climb or descent profiles and power settings should also be considered for
   efficient fuel usage. Aircrews should employ the following aviation fuel optimization
   measures without compromising flight safety or jeopardizing mission/training
   accomplishment.
   6.19.2.1. Optimize fuel loads. Mission plan for the required ramp and recovery fuel. Ensure
   ramp fuel is correct upon arrival at the aircraft.
       6.19.2.2. Minimize APU use. Use ground power units when practical.
       6.19.2.3. Delay engine start time. Establish and implement local engines start time
       standards.
       6.19.2.4. Minimize aircraft weight through optimized fuel loads and reduction of
       equipment not necessary to accomplish the mission.
       6.19.2.5. Establish C2 and flight following procedures to ensure timely notification of
       mission changes/cancellations to avoid unnecessary or unproductive flight time.
6.20. Mission Folder. The unit will develop a mission folder for each mission to ensure all
predeparture information is available to aircrews. This folder will include the Flight
Authorization, Go/No-Go verification, risk assessment and other forms and information required
for the mission.
6.21. Navigation Kits. The PIC will ensure the worldwide navigation kits are loaded on the
aircraft prior to any off-station mission. Local area navigation kit should be developed and used
for all local flights.
   6.21.1. Minimum contents of route navigation kits will be in accordance with Figure 6.2
   Commanders may modify the items as necessary to meet operational requirements.

Section 6C—Preflight

6.22. Aircraft Civilian Maintenance Forms. Review the official aircraft civilian maintenance
forms before applying power to the aircraft or operating aircraft systems. The exceptional
release must be signed before flight. A maintenance officer, maintenance superintendent, or
authorized civilian normally signs the exceptional release out of home station. If one of these
individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the exceptional release.
6.23. En Route Aircraft Preflights. Crew chiefs/civilian maintenance and AMSS will
accomplish aircraft preflights following crew rest. Anytime en route maintenance has been
performed, the affected systems will be pre-flighted and should be operationally checked as soon
as possible, if practical. Thru-flight inspections will be completed anytime a preflight is not
required. LM only need to accomplish a thru-flight inspection at en route stops.
6.24. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
   6.24.1. Aircraft Refueling and De-fueling. Qualified civilian maintenance personnel and
   crew chiefs are authorized to refuel or de-fuel the aircraft. Comply with the appropriate
   aircraft fueling manuals and T.O. 00-25-172 (if applicable).
   6.24.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. Simultaneous refueling or de-fueling while
   maintenance operations are being performed and/or cargo is being uploaded or downloaded
   is authorized IAW T.O. 00-25-172.
       6.24.2.1. Aircrew members are authorized to enplane or deplane during fuel servicing to
       perform normal aircrew duties.
       6.24.2.2. Aircrew personnel are authorized to conduct "power off" portions of
       inspections during servicing when essential to meet operational turn-around
       requirements.
 50                                                        AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


       6.24.2.3. Passengers may remain on board the aircraft during refueling, provided they are
       briefed on the hazards of the operation. Stairs and exit(s) will be positioned (if required)
       with doors open. Passengers will not enplane or deplane during fueling operations unless
       absolutely necessary and escorted by an aircrew member. A standby fire truck is
       required if servicing with JP-4 or Jet B fuels.
   6.24.3. Crash, Fire, and Rescue Protection:
       6.24.3.1. The aircraft engine fire extinguisher system fulfills the minimum requirements
       for fire protection during engine start. If available, position a portable fire extinguisher
       for added fire protection.
       6.24.3.2. A fireguard is not required for engine start but should be utilized to the
       maximum extent possible.
6.25. Aircrew/Maintenance Engine Run-ups. Due to procedural differences, a mixed
aircrew/maintenance engine run should not be accomplished.
6.26. Towing. The PIC will coordinate with the senior maintenance officer or superintendent to
ensure the towing supervisor and crew is qualified. The PIC will ensure that the tow team
supervisor briefs all personnel on their duties and the associated hazards. Proper checklists will
be used. If any doubt exists as to the qualification of the tow team personnel or the safety of the
operation, make no attempt to tow the aircraft until qualified personnel can be located.
   6.26.1. Towing Procedures. Pilots may act as a tow team member if they are trained and
   qualified IAW applicable unit guidance.
   6.26.2. During towing operations shut the APU off prior to any part of the aircraft entering
   hangars and do not restart the APU until the aircraft is completely clear of hangars.
6.27. Aircrew Flight Equipment Requirements:
   6.27.1. Oxygen Requirements. The minimum quantity of oxygen aboard an aircraft before
   takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned flight from the equal time point (ETP)
   to recovery should oxygen be required. C-32B dispatch oxygen requirement will be the
   greater of the maintenance placard value or what is required by the FPPM for the mission
   being flown.
   6.27.2. Aircrew members will comply with the oxygen requirements specified in AFI 11-
   202V3.
   6.27.3. Prior to each flight, flight deck crew members will accomplish a communications
   and operational check of their oxygen masks and smoke goggles.
   6.27.4. All primary crew members will use supplemental oxygen for flight when the cabin
   altitude exceeds 10,000 feet MSL. NOTE: Primary cabin crew members should use the
   aircraft portable oxygen bottles or a passenger service unit (PSU) to comply with this
   requirement.
   6.27.5. Rafts. Ensure sufficient life rafts are on board to accommodate all passengers and
   aircrew members on overwater flights.
   6.27.6. Ensure a sufficient quantity of Adult-Child life vests will be aboard for all passengers
   and crew members for overwater flights.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                    51


   6.27.7. Aircrew Flight Equipment. Prior to departing home station, the PIC or designated
   representative will ensure appropriate serviceable AFE, and survival equipment for the entire
   mission are aboard the aircraft and all required inspections have been completed. The AFE
   section is responsible to ensure that the AFE on the airplane is current and operable. Local
   training missions require an aircrew preflight inspection prior to the first flight of the day.
   Aircrew members discovering used or missing equipment will make an entry in the aircraft
   maintenance forms for standard commercial aircraft equipment. If Air Force issued
   equipment is used or missing, notify AFE section. NOTE: Prior to the first flight each day,
   the AFTO Form 46 must be signed off by the aircrew member who pre-flights the aircraft life
   support emergency equipment.
6.28. Transponder Operations. Aircraft will not depart without an operable transponder
capable of reporting Mode 3/A and C.
   6.28.1. Aircraft will not depart with an Identify Friend or Foe/Selective Identify Frequency
   (IFF/SIF) known to be inoperative if the mission requires mode 4 to be reported.
   6.28.2. If an operational mode 4 is required. An operational check of the mode 4 will be
   made prior to takeoff (a self test satisfies this requirement). If the mode 4 checks bad or fails
   in-flight, the IFF/SIF unit will be repaired prior to flight and/or aircraft landed for repairs
   except for the following:
       6.28.2.1. Missions that are generated in the CONUS and do not plan to exit the CONUS
       ADIZ.
       6.28.2.2. Non-training peacetime missions where cancellation or return to base (RTB)
       for mode 4 failure would seriously degrade mission effectiveness (i.e., alert response,
       disaster relief, aeromedical evacuation, etc.).
       6.28.2.3. Mission where the aircraft will not transit an area where safe passage
       procedures are in effect.
   6.28.3. Ground and in-flight checks of the mode 4 are mandatory maintenance debrief items.
   Crews will annotate any failure or unsuccessful interrogation of the mode 4.
   6.28.4. Use the IFF/SIF IAW local procedures.
       6.28.4.1. IFF/SIF mode 1, 2, and 3/A codes, once set and transmitted, are unclassified
       and may be left in the transponder.
       6.28.4.2. IFF/SIF mode 4 codes must be zeroized before leaving the aircraft.
6.29. Dropped Object Prevention. During aircraft exterior visual inspections, pay particular
attention to surface panels, and components which potentially could be dropped objects. If a
dropped object is discovered and the mission is continued, the flight crew:
   6.29.1. Ensures the write up is entered in the appropriate forms.
   6.29.2. Notify the unit operations officer, unit safety officer, and C2 as soon as practicable,
   to include route of flight, altitude and weather (i.e., turbulence, etc.).
6.30. Narcotics. Crew members will ensure narcotics and other unauthorized items are not
smuggled aboard the aircraft.
6.31. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects:
 52                                                        AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


   6.31.1. Hold the number of crew members on the flight deck to the minimum commensurate
   with the mission requirements.
   6.31.2. Keep the flight deck uncluttered and orderly for all flight and ground operations.
   6.31.3. Do not place any item (checklist, chart, etc.) on the center pedestal in a position that
   covers or hides from view any switch, light, or gauge. Do not place any item behind the
   throttle quadrant which could interfere with thrust lever movement.
6.32. Flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) systems. Should be
operative prior to departure and operated continuously from the start of the takeoff roll until the
aircraft has completed landing roll at destination. If en route failure occurs, continue the mission
to a station where adequate repairs can be made. If involved in a mishap or incident, open the
CVR and FDR power circuit breaker after landing and after terminating the emergency. CVR
recordings are considered factual and the transcript is not a privileged document. The actual
aircrew voices on the tape are considered protected under the privacy act according to AFI 91-
204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
6.33. Passenger Policy. DoD 4515.13-R, establishes criteria for passenger movement on DoD
aircraft. It defines five categories of passenger travel: space-available, aeromedical evacuation,
orientation, public affairs, and space-required. AFI 11-401, Flight Management, provides further
guidance on orientation and public affairs travel. Refer to these publications directly for details
not addressed in this instruction. In all cases, passengers will be manifested on DD Form 2131,
Passenger Manifest. Refer to paragraph 3.5 of this AFI for ACM policy.
   6.33.1. Space-available. C-32B aircraft will not be used for space-available travel.

       approved on a case by case basis by the OG/CC (or equivalent). Simulated EPs are
       prohibited. All other events may be conducted as approved by the approval authority
       listed in AFI 11-401.
   6.33.5. Space-required. DoD 4515.13-R lists several categories of passengers, not
   previously mentioned, who are authorized official travel on DoD aircraft.
       6.33.5.1. Supported forces. A sub-category of space-required passenger defined by this
       instruction as US and foreign military and civilian personnel who are an integral part of
       the mission being performed. Eligibility under this status is granted by the approval
       authority for the mission; and is assumed by the mission tasking. Supported forces must
       be properly manifested.
           6.33.5.1.1. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified unless excepted by AFI
           11-401, paragraph 1.12. (Requirements for Pilots in Dual-Controlled Aircraft) and
           Chapter 3 of this AFI. Simulated EPs are prohibited. All other events are authorized.
           PICs will ensure that supported forces are briefed on the mission profile and mission
           events before flight.
       6.33.5.2. Supporting forces. A sub-category of space-required passenger defined by this
       instruction as US and foreign military, DoD civilians, and US civilian employees under
       contract to the DoD, who directly support the mission or a deployment of an
       AFSOC/ANG unit.           This may include, but is not limited to; maintenance,
       communications, intelligence, logistics, and flight test personnel, civilian contractors
       required for in-flight checks or deployment support and other military personnel who are
       on board to communicate/coordinate with other agencies. Eligibility under this status is
       granted by the approval authority for the mission. Off-station travel is documented by
       travel orders. Local flights will be approved by the OG/CC (or equivalent).
       EXCEPTION: Unit/CC may approve assigned personnel. When frequent local flights
       are necessary, commanders may issue annual authorizations by name or AFSC as
       appropriate. Supporting forces must be properly manifested.
           6.33.5.2.1. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified unless excepted by AFI
           11-401, paragraph 1.12 (Requirements for Pilots in Dual-Controlled Aircraft) and
           Chapter 3 of this AFI. Simulated EPs are prohibited. All other events are
           authorized. PICs will ensure that supporting forces are briefed on the mission profile
           and mission events before flight. EXCEPTION: EPs required for the purposes of a
           functional check flight are authorized. In this context, personnel on board are
           required for mission accomplishment. Limit personnel to absolute minimum
           required. Other mission events are authorized.
6.34. One-time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight, with a condition that
might be hazardous for continued use, if the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to another station.
MAJCOM/A3 is the approval authority.
   6.34.1. The release must first be authorized by the chief of maintenance, the senior
   maintenance officer, or the chief Boeing repair specialist.
 54                                                     AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


   6.34.2. After the maintenance release is obtained, contact MAJCOM/A3 for flight
   authorization.
   6.34.3. The maintenance release, MAJCOM approval, and the PIC’s concurrence are all
   required before the aircraft can be flown to the specified destination.
6.35. Functional and Acceptance Check Flights (FCF and ACF). Perform FCF and ACF
duties IAW T.O. 1-1-300, applicable group/wing supplements and applicable aircraft checklists.
The unit will submit an FCF letter to the OG/CC (or equivalent). The FCF letter, at a minimum,
will include crew qualification and position. All FCF crews will be IP’s or higher. EP’s are
automatically FCF qualified.

Section 6D—Departure

6.36. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are considered on time if the aircraft is airborne
from 20 minutes prior to 14 minutes past the scheduled takeoff time.
   6.36.1. AAR Missions. Scheduled takeoff time may be adjusted to make the ARCT. Notify
   the C2 agencies (as applicable) as soon as possible with the updated information.
   6.36.2. Early Departures:
       6.36.2.1. Home Station. Early departures are authorized to prevent a delay due to
       weather, ATC or airfield operating restrictions.
       6.36.2.2. En route Stations. Early departures at en route stations may be authorized
       provided the impact on local and downrange facilities, diplomatic clearance restrictions
       and crew duty time is evaluated. Notify the controlling C2 agency for any purposed or
       actual itinerary changes.
6.37. Cabin Security Procedures for Takeoff and Landing. The following procedures should
be followed prior to all takeoffs and landings:
   6.37.1. The LM should assure all carry-on luggage and supplies are secured as soon as
   possible after boarding passengers. Ensure all passenger carry-on baggage is stowed to
   prevent a hazard during emergency landings, (i.e., blocking an exit or emergency
   equipment). Notify the PIC when excessive topside baggage/cargo precludes safe stowage.
   6.37.2. The LM should notify the cockpit crew that the cabin is secure prior to being seated
   for takeoff or landing. The cockpit crew should confirm the cabin security report prior to
   takeoff and landing.

Section 6E—Enroute

6.38. Flight Progress.
   6.38.1. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. US military aircraft and DoD
   personnel entering another nation to conduct US government business therein must have the
   approval of the foreign government concerned to enter their airspace. Foreign clearances for
   US international air operations are obtained through US officials known as Defense Attaché
   Officers (DAOs). Refer to FLIP GP for international strait passage, archipelagic sea lane
   passage, procedures to follow if intercepted, and other foreign sovereignty issues.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                     55


       6.38.1.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and
       territorial airspace. International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states
       territorial seas. Military aircraft operate in such areas free of interference or control by
       the coastal state. Territorial airspace includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic
       waters, inland waters, and land territory and is sovereign airspace. Overflight may be
       conducted in such areas only with the consent of the sovereign country.
       6.38.1.2. In accordance with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12
       nautical miles. Diplomatic constraints and/or a lack of diplomatic clearances usually
       result in missions operating in international airspace. Because of this, it is imperative
       sufficient information be provided far enough in advance to allow compliance with FCG
       requirements established by the countries concerned. The US does not normally
       recognize territorial claims beyond 12 nautical miles; however, specific guidance from
       certain US authorities may establish limits, which differ from the standard.
       6.38.1.3. Flight Information Region (FIR). A FIR is defined as an area of airspace
       within which flight information and related services are provided. A FIR does not reflect
       international borders or sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an established
       FIR without approval of the adjacent country, provided the PIC avoids flight in sovereign
       airspace.
       6.38.1.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace
       into territorial airspace for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not
       amend entry point(s).
       6.38.1.5. Safe Passage violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or
       improper entry or departure of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace
       (12 NM from sovereign landmass) for which a clearance has not been duly requested and
       granted through diplomatic channels.
       6.38.1.6. Air traffic control agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic
       clearances for penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from
       the respective country. Aircraft clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels
       only.
       6.38.1.7. In the event air traffic control agencies challenge the validity of a flight routing
       or attempt to negate existing clearances, pilots must evaluate the circumstances. The
       normal response will be to attempt to advise the air traffic control agency that the aircraft
       will continue to the planned destination as cleared in international airspace. The key
       phrase is ―in international airspace.‖ Safety of flight is paramount in determining mission
       continuation. Under no circumstances should aircrews construe a clearance which routes
       their mission over sovereign airspace which was not approved through diplomatic
       channels prior to mission departure, as being valid authorization.
       6.38.1.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing
       will normally be briefed at home station, or the onload location but must be briefed prior
       to performing the critical portion of the mission.
6.39. Navigational Capabilities.
 56                                                      AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


   6.39.1. Oceanic and Reduced Visual Separation Minimums (RVSM) operations. C-32B
   aircraft and aircrews are RVSM compliant. For all normal oceanic operations refer to
   applicable FLIP, FAA publications, MAJCOM approved Oceanic Hardcard and the
   Supplement section (QS) of the QRH.
       6.39.1.1. For a list of required aircraft equipment and systems for entry into RVSM
       airspace reference General Planning, Chapter 5 and FLIP AP/2.
       6.39.1.2. Document (in the aircraft forms) malfunctions or failures of RVSM required
       equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet RVSM tolerances.
       6.39.1.3. Contingency Operations. After entering RVSM airspace the pilot should notify
       ATC of contingencies (aircraft system failures, weather conditions) which affect the
       ability to maintain the current flight level and coordinate a plan of action. Contingency
       procedures for specific regions and areas are located in the applicable AP series
       publications     and     on      the     FAA       RVSM       documentation     webpage:
       http://www.faa.gov/ats/ato/rvsm1.htm.
   6.39.2. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace. Airspace where RNP is applied
   is considered special qualification airspace. Both the operator and the specific aircraft type
   must be approved for operations in these areas. C-32B aircraft are approved for RNP
   operations. The following are RNP requirements.
       6.39.2.1. Preflight Procedures. Review maintenance logs to ascertain status of RNP
       Equipment.
       6.39.2.2. Enroute. At least two long range navigation systems certified for RNP must be
       operational at the oceanic entry point. Periodic crosschecks will be accomplished to
       identify navigation errors and prevent inadvertent deviation from ATC cleared routes.
       Advise ATC of the deterioration or failure of navigation equipment below navigation
       performance requirements and coordinate appropriate actions.
       6.39.2.3. Document (in the aircraft forms) malfunctions or failures of RNP required
       equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet RNP tolerances.
   6.39.3. North Atlantic minimum navigation performance specification (MNPS) airspace and
   US West Coast and Hawaii route system.
       6.39.3.1. C-32B aircraft and aircrews are certified for use of minimum navigation
       performance specification (MNPS) airspace.
       6.39.3.2. Compliance with MNPS standards (FLIP AP/2) is mandatory.
6.40. Communications Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings (CIRVIS)
and Other Reports. Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as indicated in FLIP
planning or FLIP En route Supplement.
   6.40.1. In-Flight harassment or hostile action against C-32B aircraft. Aircraft subjected to
   harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the DAO at the
   applicable American Embassy. Include aircraft nationality, type, insignia, or any other
   identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed, and the type of
   harassment.
   6.40.2. Other incidents will be reported as indicated in AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                   57


6.41. In-flight Meals. The pilot in command and copilot will not consume in-flight meals
within 90 minutes of each other, before or during flight, if the meals were procured from the
same source and consist of the same menu.
6.42. Communications. Make all communications IAW FLIP or as directed by the controlling
agency.
   6.42.1. High Frequency (HF) Communications. Confine message traffic to essential
   operational matters. Perform an HF radio ground check prior to takeoff (time permitting)
   when the use of HF radio may be required for ATC or C2 communications. Establish HF
   contact before going out of Very High Frequency (VHF)/UHF range. If unable to establish
   HF contact with the controlling HF station and an alternate means of relay of ATC
   information in oceanic areas is not available refer to the appropriate AP series for guidance.
6.43. In-flight Emergency Procedures. Report deviations from directives that occur as a result
of an emergency IAW AFI 11-202V3, and this instruction.
   6.43.1. Notification of Controlling Agencies. As soon as practical after completing the
   aircraft emergency action checklist, furnish the controlling agency and appropriate command
   and control center with a description and extent of the difficulty, assistance required,
   intentions, and any further pertinent information.
   6.43.2. Turnaround Procedures. When a turnaround is necessary, use procedures in FLIP.
   Maintain VFR, reverse course, climb or descend to a VFR altitude or flight level and request
   ATC clearance. If unable to maintain VFR, obtain an ATC clearance before reversing
   course. A turnaround under IFR conditions, without ATC approval, will be made only after a
   thorough evaluation of the seriousness of the emergency, general traffic density, and known
   traffic operating in the immediate area. Normally, a climb or descent (with minimum change
   in altitude) to a VFR altitude or flight level would result in minimum exposure to other
   aircraft, if a turnaround is required.
6.44. Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care, the PIC
will inform the station of next intended landing in sufficient time so medical personnel may meet
the aircraft. The request will include the individual’s sex, approximate age, and the nature of the
medical problem.
6.45. Weather Forecasts.
   6.45.1. The PIC is responsible for obtaining destination weather prior to descent.
   6.45.2. If a military weather source is not available, the PIC will obtain updated weather
   information via any means available. This includes, but is not limited to Aeronautical Radio
   Communications Addressing Reporting System, web based weather information via High
   Speed Data (HSD) and civilian or host nation weather services.
   6.45.3. The ATC system can provide weather information to en route aircraft on a time
   permitting basis. NOTE: The ARTCCs have a limited capability to provide weather
   information to en route aircraft within CONUS.
       6.45.3.1. Significant Meteorological Advisory (SIGMET) advisories will be transmitted
       from the servicing ATC unit. Crews will consider all SIGMETs valid for their aircraft
       until verified as not applicable with a military METRO service.
 58                                                        AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


6.46. Diversions. Notify the airfield selected for an emergency diversion as soon as possible to
allow maximum time to prepare the required assistance or services. C2 will assist the PIC as
necessary in notifying the appropriate agencies.
   6.46.1. Over-Flying Scheduled Refueling Stops. Before offering to over fly scheduled
   refueling stops, the PIC must consider all consequences that may arise. As a minimum,
   coordination with the unit CC/DO, the contact ground support, and final arrival airport must
   be considered. Notify C2 as soon as possible if this option will be utilized.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.47. Crew Coordination. The pilot flying the approach will brief the crew on the descent,
approach, and landing IAW the flight manual. The other pilot will monitor the approach and
report any deviations from prescribed procedures. Crew members will confine their activities to
aircraft operation, descent or approach monitoring and checklist accomplishment from the initial
descent point to block in. Crew members should not deviate from these duties except for in-
flight emergencies.
6.48. Instrument Approach Minimums. The C-32B is normally a category "C" aircraft for
straight-in approaches and a category D aircraft for circling. If approach speed is higher than
140 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), use category "D" minimums.
6.49. Weather Below Minimums. Prior to starting an instrument approach or beginning an en
route descent, pilots will confirm that existing weather is reported to be at or above the required
minimums for the lowest compatible approach. Pilots shall increase the published visibility
minimums of an instrument approach by 1/2 SM or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the
approach plate, when the runway approach lighting system (ALS) is inoperative. NOTE: This
applies only to the ALS itself, not to VASIs, PAPIs, and other lights that are not a component of
the ALS.
   6.49.1. If a pilot starts the published approach, (an enroute descent to an approach may be
   considered a published approach), and subsequently determines the weather is below
   minimums, the pilot must not deviate from the last ATC clearance until obtaining a new or
   amended clearance. The pilot may elect to:
       6.49.1.1. Request clearance to a holding fix or alternate, as applicable.
       6.49.1.2. Continue the approach as published to the missed approach point and land, if
       the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing and the runway environment is in sight.
   6.49.2. If the approach is continued, PICs should plan to have sufficient fuel available to
   complete the approach and missed approach and proceed to a suitable alternate with normal
   fuel reserves.
   6.49.3. The PIC has final responsibility for determining when the destination is below
   designated minimums and for initiating proper clearance request.
6.50. Precision Approach Minima.
   6.50.1. Visibility only. Pilots flying straight in approaches may start the approach (to
   include en route descent) if the existing visibility is greater than or equal to the published
   visibility minimums.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                    59


   6.50.2. Ceiling and Visibility. Pilots flying circling approaches may start the approach (to
   include en route descent) if the existing ceiling and visibility are greater than or equal to the
   published minimums.
   6.50.3. Height Above Touchdown (HAT). The Category I ILS or Precision Approach Radar
   (PAR) decision height will provide a HAT of at least 200 feet. For category (CAT) II ILS
   approaches, use the lowest published radar altitude that will provide a HAT of at least 100
   feet.
   6.50.4. Visibility. For PAR approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 2,400 (730
   meters) or 1/2 mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR readout available. For category
   (CAT) I ILS approaches RVR will be at least 1,800 RVR or higher. For CAT II approaches
   the touchdown zone RVR must be at least 1,200 RVR. Mid/rollout RVR values will be used
   as advisory information. Rollout RVR (or Mid RVR, if rollout RVR is inoperative) is
   required when RVR is less than 1,600 to provide advisory information to pilots.
6.51. Circling Approaches. For circling approaches, minimum descent altitude (MDA) will be
as published for aircraft category. If the minimums are not published by category, the minimum
altitude will be no lower than the value indicated below, plus the published airport elevation.
   6.51.1. Category C-500 feet - 1 1/2 miles.
   6.51.2. Category D-600 feet - 2 miles.
6.52. Instrument Approach Procedures:
   6.52.1. Fly a precision approach at night and during marginal weather. If a precision
   approach is not available, fly any available approved instrument approach. On training or
   evaluation flights pilots may fly non-precision approaches or VFR traffic patterns to
   accomplish required training and evaluation requirements.
   6.52.2. Auto landings are authorized for Category I (Cat I) or Cat II ILS approaches.
   6.52.3. RNAV, Global Positioning System (GPS) and RNAV/(GPS) Instrument Departures,
   Arrival and Approaches. C-32B aircrews are authorized to fly GPS and RNAV instrument
   departures, arrivals and approaches day or night, IMC or VMC. Comply with procedures
   IAW AFI 11-202V3 and the QS section of the QRH. Aircraft must have required navigation
   performance (RNP) as published on the IAP procedure being flown. The PNF shall monitor
   lateral cross track, vertical velocity trends and report any EICAS limiting malfunctions to the
   PF. The PF shall execute a missed approach if excessive deviations occur.
   6.52.4. Equipment. Aircraft must have the appropriate level of ANP available IAW the
   operations manual procedures prior to initiating the approach. IAP notes such as ―Distance
   Measuring Equipment (DME)/DME RNP 0.3 N/A‖ or ―GPS Required‖ state that GPS signal
   and aircraft equipment must be operational to start the approach. For aircraft where the MEL
   does not allow the approach, or if the required approach ANP is not available, the approach
   shall not be flown.
6.53. Alternate Flight Publications. The following publications are authorized if acceptable
DoD FLIP products are not available:
   6.53.1. United States Department of Transportation National Aeronautical Charting Office
   (NACO).

   6.54.1. CAT II restrictions.
        6.54.1.1. Both pilots must be CAT II current and qualified (for training exceptions, see
        chapter 9 of this AFI).
        6.54.1.2. When using visibility only the aircraft must have enough fuel for the approach,
        missed approach and flight to the alternate, and to arrive at the alternate with the required
        reserves.
        6.54.1.3. CAT II approaches without a radio altimeter (RA) setting for DH are not
        authorized. ―RA/NA‖ denotes irregular terrain changes that affect the ability to
        accurately set RA.
        6.54.1.4. CAT II minimums are based on a HAT no lower than 100 feet.
        6.54.1.5. The minimum CAT II RVR is 1,200.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                     61


       6.54.1.6. The maximum crosswind is 25 knots for autoland, and 10 knots for a manual
       landing. NOTE: Actual CAT II approaches should always be accomplished coupled.
       Approaches may be accomplished manually if the autopilot(s) is/are unreliable or
       inoperative. If ―No Autoland‖ is annunciated on the ASA or if accomplishing a No ASA
       approach, a manual landing must be accomplished.
       6.54.1.7. As a minimum, the following airfield equipment must be operational:
           6.54.1.7.1. Approach Lights.
           6.54.1.7.2. Runway centerline lighting.
           6.54.1.7.3. High intensity runway lights or touchdown zone lights.
           6.54.1.7.4. Touchdown     zone       and   either   mid   or   rollout   (advisory   only)
           transmissometers.
           6.54.1.7.5. ILS far field monitor.
           6.54.1.7.6. Sequenced flashers.
6.55. Radio Altimeter Procedures.
   6.55.1. Takeoff. Set the radio altimeter as briefed, if no value is specified, set the radio
   altimeter for the anticipated approach HAT/HAA for an emergency return.
   6.55.2. Approach/Landing. Set the radio altimeters to the HAT/HAA for the approach being
   flown. If arriving via a VFR traffic pattern and not using an instrument approach as a
   backup, set the radio altimeter to 300 ft.
6.56. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Pilots must exercise the discipline necessary to ensure
wake turbulence avoidance criteria is observed during flight operations. Acceptance of visual or
contact approach clearance or instructions to follow an aircraft is acknowledgment that the pilot
will maintain a safe interval for wake turbulence avoidance.
   6.56.1. For VFR traffic patterns behind larger aircraft, follow "Vortex Avoidance
   Procedures" in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).
   6.56.2. For takeoff or landing behind larger jets that execute a low approach, missed
   approach, or touch-and-go landing, ensure at least 2 minutes separation.
6.57. Brake Cooling Procedures.
   6.57.1. Takeoff. Takeoffs are authorized following full stop landings provided the ground
   time is greater than or equal to the time required by the recommended brake cooling schedule
   chart from the FPPM/QRH. CAUTION: Takeoff with greater than ambient brake
   temperatures may increase stopping distances in the event of an RTO. PICs should take this
   into consideration when determining the minimum turn around time if the required takeoff
   distance is close to the actual runway available. NOTE: The brakes reach their maximum
   temperature after approximately 15 minutes, and the crews should take this time/temperature
   lag into account. Refer to Brake Cooling Schedule in the QRH/FPPM after a full-stop
   landing if subsequent take-off is less than 15 minutes.
 62                                                       AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


   6.57.2. Landing. Full stop landings will be delayed until the Brake Temperature Monitoring
   System (BTMS) reads < ―2.‖ While full stop landings may be accomplished with an
   indication of ―2‖, this should not be considered the norm.

Section 6G—POSTFLIGHT

6.58. Impoundment. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the PIC should
impound the aircraft immediately after landing and contact the MAJCOM C2 or appropriate
controlling agency for further instructions.
6.59. Maintenance. The PIC will complete the appropriate maintenance forms.
   6.59.1. Immediately after arrival, the PIC and other pertinent crew members debrief
   maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, avionics equipment, and all
   installed special equipment. The PIC will ensure a thorough maintenance debrief is provided
   (if necessary) to the controlling agency prior to entering crew rest.

Section 6H—MISCELLANEOUS PROCEDURES

6.60. Border Clearance. Comply with the Border Clearance Guide and this AFI for border
clearance procedures.
   6.60.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border clearance of
   all aircraft.
   6.60.2. When staff support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the
   aircraft commander. Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or to other designated crew
   members, but the PIC retains ultimate responsibility. The PIC is responsible for ensuring the
   following:
       6.60.2.1. Crew members and passengers possess current passports and valid visas (if
       required).
       6.60.2.2. Crew members and passengers have current certificates of immunization (PHS
       731, shot record).
       6.60.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
       6.60.2.4. Departing or entering the United States through an airport (civilian or military)
       where border clearance can be obtained.
       6.60.2.5. Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and baggage, if
       required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign area.
       6.60.2.6. Spraying the aircraft (Foreign Clearance Guide and this AFI).
   6.60.3. Procedures for US Entry:
       6.60.3.1. En route, the LM or designated crew member will distribute personal customs
       declarations to all passengers and crew members. The LM or designated crew member
       will also brief passengers and crew members on customs regulations, and prepare and
       compile necessary border clearance forms for signature.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                    63


      6.60.3.2. En route, the AMSS should notify the C2 agency or airfield contact at the base
      of intended landing of any change in ETA to ensure that border clearance is
      accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
      6.60.3.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an aircraft
      (which has landed in the United States for customs clearance) proceeds to another base in
      the US to obtain border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of
      cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the off-load station and saves intermediate
      off-loading and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The permit to
      proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing where the border clearance must be
      completed or a new permit to proceed is issued by a customs official. Do not make
      intermediate stops between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination of
      manifested cargo unless required by an emergency situation or directed by the controlling
      C2 agency.
      6.60.3.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
      normally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane
      passengers or crew members unless necessary for safety or the preservation of life and
      property. Do not unload until approved by customs and agriculture personnel or their
      designated representatives. This procedure applies to the initial landing in the US and all
      landings required when operating on a permit to proceed or until all crew, passengers,
      and cargo complete final border clearance.
6.61. Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture Inspections:
   6.61.1. Obtain Customs, Agriculture, and Public Health clearance, as required, prior to
   opening any doors, hatches, or windows, other than the left forward entry door, for enplaning
   host nation personnel.
   6.61.2. Proceed directly from the aircraft to Customs, Immigration, or Agricultural
   inspection for processing when required by the inspector.
   6.61.3. US military aircraft are sovereign. When cleared to overfly or land in foreign
   territory, it is US policy to assert that military aircraft are entitled to the privileges and
   immunities which customarily are accorded warships. These privileges and immunities
   include, in the absence of stipulations to the contrary, exemption from duties and taxation;
   immunity from search, seizure, and inspections (including customs, immigration and
   agriculture inspections); or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft,
   personnel, equipment, or cargo on board. USAF PICs should not authorize search, seizure,
   inspection, or similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities
   except by direction of Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF) or the American
   Embassy in the country concerned.
   6.61.4. PICs should not permit the inspection of their aircraft by officials of any foreign
   government (including customs, immigration and agriculture inspections). If requested to do
   so, the PIC and crew should deny access and seek aid from the senior USAF representative,
   US Embassy, or consulate within the host nation. Customs or other officials will be
   informed of the above policy and requested to confirm their request through their own
   government and with US Department of State representatives. If necessary, the crew should
   seal the aircraft and the crew entered into crew rest, departure intention should be canceled,
 64                                                         AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


   until resolution of the matter by appropriate authority. Inform command and control
   authorities by the fastest available means should this situation occur. NOTE: PIC’s should
   be aware that denying entry to host nation customs/agriculture may result in the suspension
   of all ground services at the airfield (ATC filing, refueling, meals etc.) and the ability for the
   aircrew to deplane and enter crew rest (if applicable). PIC’s will use their judgment to
   determine the best course of action, taking into consideration the urgency and priority of the
   mission and aircraft security. In all cases, AmEmbassy guidance (if available) will be
   followed.
   6.61.5. When confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should
   consider the following procedures:
       6.61.5.1. In most cases, search attempts may be stopped by a statement of PICs to the
       foreign officials that the aircraft is sovereign and not subject to search without consent of
       HQ USAF or the chief of mission in the country concerned. This should be clearly
       conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign authorities who may honestly, but
       mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft.
       6.61.5.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, PICs should negotiate to
       delay the search until contact is made with the appropriate embassy. PICs should
       unequivocally state that they have no authority to consent to the search and that they must
       relay the foreign request to these agencies for decision. PICs should then notify these
       agencies of the foreign request by the most expeditious means available. Thereafter,
       PICs should follow instructions provided by the appropriate embassy and HQ USAF.
       6.61.5.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, PICs should indicate
       that they would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel and mechanical
       considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission to do so.
       6.61.5.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way
       on board an aircraft, PICs should state that they protest the course of action being pursued
       and that they intend to notify both the appropriate American Embassy and HQ USAF of
       the foreign action. PICs should then allow the foreign agents on board the aircraft,
       without physical resistance, and thereafter report the incident to HQ USAF and
       appropriate embassy as soon as possible.
       6.61.5.5. In all instances, specific instructions may be briefed because of sensitive cargo
       or equipment. These instructions and applicable provisions of classified supplements to
       the foreign clearance guide should be followed where applicable.
6.62. Insect and Pest Control.
   6.62.1. Responsibility. PICs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to
   AFJI 48-104, Quarantine Regulations of the Armed Forces (Joint), Department of Defense
   Foreign Clearance Guide, or as directed by higher headquarters. Certify the spraying on CBP
   7507, or on forms provided by the country transited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with
   passengers on-board. The only exception is when the Foreign Clearance Guide mandates it.
   6.62.2. Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not
   open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for
   insect or rodent infestation or to deplane the minimum number of crew members required for
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                  65


   block-in duties. Do not on-load or off-load cargo or passengers until the inspection is
   satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local
   requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.
6.63. Due Regard Procedures. When a unit commander authorizes a mission to be flown in
international airspace and in-flight operational requirements conflict with ICAO rules and
procedures, the PIC may make the decision to proceed using "due regard" procedures IAW
General Planning.
6.64. Hazardous Material Procedures. The term "hazardous material" refers to any material,
because of its quantity, properties, or packaging, may endanger human life or property.
Reference AFJI 11-204 and AFJM 24-204 for all procedures and restrictions when handling any
hazardous materials. Waiver authority is MAJCOM/CC.
6.65. Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards (ETOPS):
   6.65.1. ETOPS are operations in any geographical area where, at any point on the planned
   route, the aircraft will be more than 60 minutes from an adequate airport, at the single engine
   drift down speed and altitude in still air. An ETOPS area of operation may also be
   considered to apply to over-land areas having suitable airports within 60 minutes, at the
   single engine drift down speed and altitude in still air, but are not considered useable for
   political or military considerations.
   6.65.2. The C-32B is considered 180 minute ETOPS compliant.
   6.65.3. ETOPS relief and waivers. Unit CC/DO is the waiver authority for all ETOPS
   related waivers.
      6.65.3.1. ETOPS relief notification due to route. If upon optimizing the flight plan, the
      flight cannot remain within the maximum ETOPS range, the mission planner or aircrew
      will notify the unit CC/DO. For flights that cannot remain within the maximum ETOPS
      range the following applies.
          6.65.3.1.1. Training missions: ETOPS compliance is mandatory. Flights will be
          rerouted, delayed or cancelled until all ETOPS criteria are satisfied.
          6.65.3.1.2. HHQ directed alert launches or operational support missions: The unit
          CC/DO will evaluate and direct the aircrew how they want the mission to proceed.
      6.65.3.2. ETOPS waivers for mechanical reasons. If the MEL item states ―Except for
      ER‖, ―Extended range not authorized‖ or lists a lower ETOPS time value (120, 90, etc.),
      the following applies.
          6.65.3.2.1. Training missions must comply with the MEL directed ETOPS range
          limits. If unable to comply, they will not operate in extended range airspace until the
          condition is corrected.
          6.65.3.2.2. . HHQ directed alert launches or operational support missions: Waiver
          authority for extended range operations outside the MEL is the unit CC/DO. NOTE:
          Other than extended range operations, OG/CC (or equivalent) retains all MEL waiver
          authority.
66                                                      AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


  6.65.4. Dispatch Criteria. Flights shall not be dispatched on an ETOPS flight unless the
  required suitable ETOPS enroute alternates are reviewed prior to flight. An airport may not
  be listed as a suitable ETOPS enroute alternate unless:
     6.65.4.1. The landing distance required meets the criteria established in Table 5.1 of this
     AFI.
     6.65.4.2. The airport services and facilities are adequate for the approved approach
     procedure(s) and operating minima for the runway expected to be used.
     6.65.4.3. The latest available forecast weather conditions from the earliest time of
     landing to the latest time of landing at the airport, equals or exceeds the authorized
     planning weather minima for ETOPS enroute alternate airports. In addition, for the same
     time period, the forecast crosswind component (including gust) for the expected landing
     runway shall not exceed the maximum crosswind permitted in Table 5.3 of this AFI.
     6.65.4.4. The airport must have one of the following combinations of instrument
     approach capabilities and weather minima:
         6.65.4.4.1. A single operational navigation facility. For airports with at least one
         operational navigational facility providing a straight-in non-precision approach
         procedure, or Category I precision approach, or when applicable, a circling maneuver
         from an instrument approach procedure: add 400ft to the MDA(H) or DA(H), as
         applicable and add 1SM or 1600m to the landing visibility minimum.
         6.65.4.4.2. For airports with at least two operational navigational facilities, each
         providing a straight-in approach procedure to different suitable runways: add 200ft to
         the higher DA(H) or MDA(H) of the thwo approaches used and add 1/2sm or 800m
         to the higher authorized landing visibility minimum of the two approaches used.
         6.65.4.4.3. For airports with one useable authorized Category II ILS IAP, use a
         ceiling of 300ft and visibility ¾ sm (1200 m) or RVR 4000 (1200 m)         NOTE:
         Conditional forecast elements need not be considered, except that PROB40 or
         TEMPO condition below lowest applicable operating minima must be taken into
         account. NOTE: For operations outside the United States, because of variations in
         the international metric weather forecasting standards, 700m may be used in lieu of
         800m.
         6.65.4.4.4. Lower than standard en route alternate weather minima. If a suitable
         ETOPS alternate cannot be found meeting the guidance of paragraph 6.65.4.4 the
         flight crew or mission planner will select a suitable alternate having a ceiling and
         visibility greater than or equal to the lowest suitable approach minimums available
         (excluding radar) for the expected runway in use, but not less than a ceiling of 200
         feet and a visibility of one-half statute mile (800m) or RVR 2,400; whichever is
         higher; and winds within operational limits of the aircraft, corrected for RCR. If
         these minima are used, the aircrew must be notified prior to departure. The mission
         planner and the aircraft commander will evaluate the weather and diversion scenario
         and shall formulate an understanding of the preferred diversion airports that may be
         used during the portion of the flight affected by the use of the en-route alternate
         weather minima.       NOTE: Lower than standard en route weather minima is for
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                67


         operational or operations support missions with passengers only.           Unit CC/DO
         approval is required. For training missions, comply with 6.65.3.1.1.
  6.65.5. ETOPS Range Calculations: An initial calculation is performed to determine ETOPS
  range and location of ETP(s) for a diversion based on the scenario whereby an engine loss
  occurs at the most critical point, and the aircraft continues to the alternate at an approved
  power setting, at the engine inoperative drift down altitude. This calculation is based on an
  average no wind true airspeed constant not exceeding the AFM limitations for speed and
  altitude. Computation of the ETOPS range limitation is determined by the following:
     6.65.5.1. Engine loss and decompression is at the most critical point (ETP).
     6.65.5.2. Immediate descent to, and continued cruise at 10,000 feet at the approved one-
     engine inoperative cruise speed, in still air.
     6.65.5.3. Using the FPPM, assuming an in-flight weight of 210,000 and a speed of
     310/.80 the range for 180 minutes is 1,268 NM.
  6.65.6. ETOPS Fuel Requirements. Additional fuel requirements for all flights operating in
  extended range airspace, as defined by paragraph 6.65.1, will account for the following:
     6.65.6.1. Upon reaching the suitable alternate, descent to 1,500 feet above the field
     elevation, hold for 15 minutes, and then execution of a normal approach and landing.
         6.65.6.1.1. 5% penalty for errors in wind forecasts.
         6.65.6.1.2. 5% penalty in fuel mileage for engine deterioration.
         6.65.6.1.3. APU operation.
         6.65.6.1.4. MEL/CDL penalties.
         6.65.6.1.5. Airframe and engine Anti-icing. NOTE: Only required if temperatures
         below a certain value are expected during the diversion.      NOTE: These fuel
         requirements are calculated from the extended range entry to exit point, not for the
         entire route of flight.
  6.65.7. En-Route Progress.
     6.65.7.1. Prior to the extended range entry point. During the course of the flight, the
     aircrew will stay informed of any significant changes in conditions at the designated
     enroute alternates. Prior to the extended range entry point, the aircrew will ensure the
     weather from the earliest to the latest time of landing at the designated ETOPS alternates,
     equals or exceeds the authorized planning weather minima for enroute alternate airports.
     In addition, for the same time period, the forecast crosswind component for the expected
     landing runway shall not exceed the maximum crosswind component permitted in Table
     5.3 of this AFI. Additionally, landing distances and airport services at the en-route
     alternate must be evaluated. If any conditions are identified which would preclude a safe
     approach and landing, and no other suitable alternates are available with 180 minutes, the
     aircraft commander will notify the unit CC/DO to determine the best course of action. If
     contact is not practical, the aircraft commander will make the decision on how to
     continue the mission.       NOTE: Training missions must comply with all ETOPS
     requirements prior to the extended range entry point.
68                                                      AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


     6.65.7.2. After the extended range entry point. If an enroute alternate becomes
     unsuitable after the aircraft has passed the extended range entry point, ETOPS weather
     minimums no longer apply. Conditions need only permit a safe approach and landing.
     The decision on how to continue rests with the PIC and needs no further approval. This
     is applicable to all missions (including aircrew training missions).
  6.65.8. Malfunctions/Emergencies.
     6.65.8.1. General. In the event of a single or multiple critical system failure with only
     one associated system remaining, the crew shall fly and land at the nearest suitable
     airport. Base this decision on all relevant factors such as aircraft conditions, weather
     enroute and suitability of alternate airports, and notify command and control as soon as
     practical of this decision.
     6.65.8.2. Situations which require a landing at the nearest suitable airport include but are
     not limited to:
        6.65.8.2.1. Engine failure/fire.
        6.65.8.2.2. Cabin smoke/fire which cannot be positively verified or extinguished.
        6.65.8.2.3. Cargo compartment fire.
        6.65.8.2.4. Operations with only one hydraulic system or with only one engine driven
        generator (without an APU) remaining.
        6.65.8.2.5. Dual EICAS failure. NOTE: If an aircraft is unable to continue its flight
        in accordance with its ATC clearance, a revised clearance shall, whenever possible,
        be obtained prior to initiating any action using the radio distress or urgency message,
        as appropriate. NOTE: If prior clearance cannot be obtained, an ATC clearance
        shall be obtained at the earliest possible time. In the meantime, the crew shall
        broadcast the aircrafts position (including the track/airway as appropriate) and
        intentions on 121.5 MHz at suitable intervals until ATC clearance is received.
     6.65.8.3. Before Passing The Extended Range Entry Point:
        6.65.8.3.1. On 120 minute ETOPS, the flight may not proceed beyond the extended
        range entry point if any of the following failures or malfunctions have occurred:
            6.65.8.3.1.1. Fuel Filter Message
            6.65.8.3.1.2. Air conditioning pack.
            6.65.8.3.1.3. Cargo compartment fire extinguisher system, unless both cargo
            compartments are empty or only non-combustible materials are carried.
            6.65.8.3.1.4. Loss of left hydraulic system together with a generator failure.
            6.65.8.3.1.5. Engine and/or wing anti-ice unless the aircraft is not to be operated
            in known or forecast icing conditions.
            6.65.8.3.1.6. Dual IRS failure.
            6.65.8.3.1.7. Dual EFIS failure (one symbol generator remaining).
            6.65.8.3.1.8. Single FMS system failure. NOTE: Both FMS systems required
            for entry into oceanic airspace.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                  69


           6.65.8.3.2. In addition to the above items a flight may not proceed beyond the
           extended range entry point on 180 minute ETOPS flights if the following failures or
           malfunctions have occurred:
              6.65.8.3.2.1. Loss of left hydraulic system.
              6.65.8.3.2.2. Loss of a generator.

              6.65.8.3.2.5. Weather radar.
6.66. Inappropriate Charges. IAW the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide, Foreword Section II,
aircrews should not pay inappropriate charges, which include any air navigation, overflight fees,
and landing or parking at any government airport. If asked to pay such charges aircrews should:
   6.66.1. Advise the local authorities that the charges are inappropriate for a US Government
   aircraft and the aircrew cannot pay them.
   6.66.2. Contact USDAO personnel or other appropriate AmEmbassy officials either at the
   airport or at the embassy itself and follow their guidance. NOTE: USDAO or AmEmbassy
   intervention may not always be feasible.
   6.66.3. If there is no USDAO or AmEmbassy guidance to the contrary and the local
   authorities will not let the aircraft depart without payment, aircrews should do the following:
       6.66.3.1. Obtain a fully itemized copy of the receipt or bill bearing the printed name and
       legible signature of the person accepting payment and note the amount paid. NOTE:
       Verify the signer’s identity by asking to see photo identification (if available).
       6.66.3.2. If cash payment is demanded, insist that the bill include a statement written in
       English that cash was paid and that a specific person received it.
       6.66.3.3. Mark inappropriate charges on the receipt or bill: ―INVALID FEES‖.
       6.66.3.4. Annotate the receipt or bill with the remark: ―PAID UNDER PROTEST.‖
       6.66.3.5. Submit the signed receipt or bill to the finance officer at the aircrew’s home
       station.

                                            Chapter 7

                                    AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting
unlawful seizure (hijacking) of aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy
(Hijacking); AFI 31-101 ; Integrated Defense and specific MAJCOM security publications
contain additional guidance. Aircrews will not release information concerning hijacking
attempts or identify armed aircrew members to the public.
7.2. Security. The C-32B is normally designated as a protection level ―3‖ asset. However, it
requires protection level ―2‖ if Top Secret/SCI information is to be stored on board. AFI 31-101
determines the security requirements for assets that are to be left unattended on U.S. Military
bases. The PIC is responsible for aircraft security at non-military installations. HHQ or the unit
OG/CC (or equivalent) may direct the use of security measures above and beyond the
requirements set forth by the PIC.
7.3. Air Force Physical Security Program. The following security procedures will implement
AFI 31-101, and AFI 13-207, requirements for C-32B aircraft:
   7.3.1. PIC Authority. The PIC will ensure that adequate aircraft security measures are
   provided at all times. If, in the PIC’s opinion, airfield security is inadequate and the safety of
   the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the flight duty period limits and crew rest
   requirements and depart as soon as possible for an airfield considered reliable; report
   movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as practical. If departure is not
   possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of their ability. In no case, will the
   crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest requirements will be subordinate to aircraft
   security when the airframe may be at risk. The PIC should rotate a security detail among the
   crew to provide for both aircraft protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request
   security assistance from the nearest DoD installation, US Embassy, local military or law
   enforcement agencies as appropriate.
   7.3.2. Advance Security Support Arrangements. The PIC will ensure security support has
   been coordinated at en route stations in advance. If security requirements cannot be met
   prior to departure, the airfield may be deemed unsuitable for RON by the unit. Units should
   use local, MAJCOM and AOR Intel/Threat Working Group (TWG) and US Embassy
   recommendations to determine suitability. The OG/CC (or equivalent) is the arbiter for
   security. CC/DO and unit mission planners will work with the PIC for alert missions and en
   route diversions.
   7.3.3. Briefings. PICs will obtain threat assessment and security capability evaluation
   briefings before departing home station for all missions that will RON outside of the United
   States or its territories. Unit CC/DO will ensure the PIC is provided with pertinent updates
   en route.
   7.3.4. Baggage Security. Baggage not certified safe for loading by a responsible government
   agency will be inspected prior to loading at the PIC's discretion. Verify baggage
   identification against the passenger manifest (if possible). Aircrew members will secure their
   own baggage. The PIC or designated representative is responsible for explaining baggage
   security requirements to the passenger POC.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                   71


   7.3.5. Flight line Photography. There are no restrictions on exterior photography of the C-
   32B. Interior photography is allowed at home station. Interior photos of enroute C-32B
   aircraft are prohibited.
7.4. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
   7.4.1. Anytime the aircraft is to remain overnight (RON) or will be left unattended for a
   significant amount of time, the following procedures apply:
       7.4.1.1. Lock all interior hatches from the inside and a padlock will be placed on the
       crew entry door and the forward E&E compartment.
       7.4.1.2. The two padlock locations will be sealed with alphanumeric seals. The seal
       numbers will be recorded by a crew member or unit maintenance.
       7.4.1.3. Upon return to the aircraft or at the completion of crew rest, whichever occurs
       first, a crew member or unit maintenance will verify the seal numbers and the internal
       security of the other aircraft entry points.
       7.4.1.4. Preflight inspections will be expanded to include a thorough check of all
       accessible areas, to include aircraft wheel wells, keel beam bays and lower nose
       compartment for unauthorized packages, personnel, other unfamiliar devices or any signs
       of tampering. Report any suspicious items to host security forces.
   7.4.2. Suspected Unauthorized Entry. If the PIC suspects aircraft has been tampered with or
   subjected to unauthorized entry, take the following actions:
       7.4.2.1. Notify the local security authorities and request a thorough inspection of the
       aircraft for sabotage, explosive devices, and pilferage.
       7.4.2.2. Notify the appropriate C2 agency. Advise them of any requirements for
       assistance, and give them your estimate of a revised departure time.
       7.4.2.3. If there are indications that sabotage is a possibility or if security inspections
       may delay the departure notify C2 and the passenger POC. Establish a new departure
       time. If necessary, coordinate alternate transportation for the passengers through C2.
       7.4.2.4. Monitor the security check of the aircraft. When cleared by security authorities,
       conduct thorough preflight inspection. Look for broken wiring, damaged components,
       foreign devices, etc.
       7.4.2.5. If both the security authorities and the PIC are assured aircraft is safe to fly,
       notify the OG/CC (or equivalent). Depart only with the OG/CC approval.
   7.4.3. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   Aircrews should maintain a heightened security posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.5. Protecting Classified Material on Aircraft. The PIC is responsible for the protection of
classified materials aboard their aircraft. The AMSS is responsible for supporting the PIC with
these duties. Comply with AFI 33-201V1, Communications Security ,AFI 33-201V2,
Communications Security User Requirements, and this AFI for the storage and protection of
classified material.
7.6. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
 72                                                   AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


   7.6.1. General. See AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking) for
   guidance.
7.7. Arming of Crew Members. When crews are directed to arm, the PIC will determine
which crew members will be armed (two crew members will be armed unless directed
otherwise). All crew members should know who is armed. Aircrew will check out weapons f
when directed by C2 or IAW the OPORD or OPLAN. Aircrews will arm IAW Chapter 10 of
this AFI. Unit commanders will ensure that crew members are familiar with weapon issue,
loading, transfer, and receipt procedures. Comply with AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons
Handling Manual, AFI 13-207 and Chapter 10 of this AFI for all arming requirements and
procedures. If an armed crew member must leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to
another authorized crew member using AF 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.

                                           Chapter 8

                        AIR-TO-AIR REFUELING PROCEDURES

8.1. General. For AAR procedures, "receiver" refers to the C-32B. "Tanker‖ refers to the
KC10/135. NATO publication ATP-56(B), Air-To-Air Refuelling provides guidance for
refueling terminology and procedures.
8.2. Air-to-Air Refueling Limitations. This chapter establishes guidelines applicable to C-32B
aircraft and aircrews, and is supplemental to those prescribed by the flight manual and other
applicable directives.
   8.2.1. Refueling During Training Missions.      AAR should not be accomplished during
   training missions when:
       8.2.1.1. Conditions are encountered that, in the opinion of the PIC, result in marginal
       control of either aircraft or the boom.
       8.2.1.2. Either the tanker or the receiver has less than the full number of engines
       operating.
       8.2.1.3. Tanker Autopilot. Tanker pilots must notify receiver pilots when any axis of the
       autopilot is not used.
       8.2.1.4. Manual Boom Latching. Without tanker disconnect capability means the boom
       operator cannot trigger an immediate disconnect. AAR operations will not be conducted
       after a known loss of tanker disconnect capability. EXCEPTION: Fuel emergency
       situation or contingency operations. EXCEPTION: Manual boom latching procedures
       are authorized for all refueling operations with the KC-10A if the tanker's independent
       disconnect system (IDS) is operational. NOTE: When conducting AAR without tanker
       automatic disconnect capability, limit contacts to the minimum number necessary to
       complete mission requirements. Do not accomplish boom limit demonstrations, or
       practice emergency separation while in the contact position. NOTE: Boom operator and
       receiver pilot must coordinate all actions as required by applicable directives and
       checklists when making AAR contacts using emergency boom latching procedures.
   8.2.2. Practice Emergency Separation:
       8.2.2.1. Prior to the actual accomplishment of a practice emergency separation,
       coordination between the tanker pilot, boom operator, and receiver pilot is mandatory.
       Coordination must include when the separation will occur and who will give the
       command of execution. Tanker pilot coordination may be accomplished over interphone
       with the boom operator.
       8.2.2.2. If separation is initiated from the contact position, the receiver’s AAR system
       must be in normal, and boom operator disconnect capability with the receiver must exist.
       8.2.2.3. Practice emergency separation will not be accomplished with passengers on
       board.
 74                                                         AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


   8.2.3. Receiver AAR Training for Unqualified or Non-Current Receiver Pilots. In-Flight
   training will be accomplished under direct AAR/IP supervision (access to a set of flight
   controls) and the following procedures apply:
       8.2.3.1. For receiver pilot initial qualification or re-qualification, a receiver
       instructor/examiner pilot will be in one of the pilot seats with immediate access to the
       controls through all phases of the refueling from pre-contact until post AAR.
       8.2.3.2. If a change of pilot control is made, the receiver aircraft will move back to at
       least the pre-contact position except for immediate assumption of control by the IP.
       8.2.3.3. If a receiver seat change takes place, move back to at least 100 feet in trail of the
       tanker and to a point where the receiver pilot can maintain visual contact with the tanker
       until the seat change is completed.
       8.2.3.4. When conducting AAR behind a KC-135 tanker, disconnect capability must be
       demonstrated by a boom operator initiated disconnect prior to conducting a limit
       demonstration or a practice emergency separation from the contact position.
   8.2.4. Weather Limitations.
       8.2.4.1. Turbulence:    Do not plan to refuel in areas of forecast or actual severe
       turbulence.
       8.2.4.2. Visibility: Do not plan to refuel in areas where forecast visibility is less than 1
       NM. Do not close from 1 NM range (2 NM for tanker cell formations) unless you have
       visual contact with the tankers. Discontinue refueling if in-flight visibility is insufficient
       to continue safe refueling operations.
8.3. Receiver PIC Responsibilities.
   8.3.1. Receiver aircraft shall squawk normal when separation from the tanker is greater than
   3 miles or as requested by ATC.
   8.3.2. Receiver aircraft will maintain two-way radio contact with ATC until cleared to the
   AAR block altitude, established in that block, and cleared to the AAR frequency by ATC.
8.4. ATC Clearance.
   8.4.1. Altitude Reservations (ALTRV). Air-to-air refueling operations are normally
   accomplished on tracks or in anchor areas published in the DoD Flight Planning Document
   (FLIP). Certain missions or operational considerations may require AAR operations in areas
   not published in FLIP in which an ALTRV is often used. NOTE: The following ALTRV
   guidance is FAA approved and these procedures should be followed while in FAA controlled
   airspace. When operating in oceanic or foreign airspace, the guidance may or may not be
   applicable. Aircrews should verify all ALTRV procedures and restrictions with the mission
   planner, host nation air traffic service or OPORD as applicable.
       8.4.1.1. An ALTRV may include all, a portion, or portions of a published route. On
       operational missions, an ALTRV is usually provided for the refueling portions of the
       route. In some cases, an ALTRV is provided from the point of departure to a specified
       point short of the destination.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                 75


      8.4.1.2. Aircraft operating on an ALTRV must operate within the altitude, time, and
      areas specified. Actual fix timing will not exceed 10 minutes from ALTRV estimates;
      otherwise the ALTRV will be canceled by ATC.
      8.4.1.3. The mission must be airborne within a certain time period. The end of this
      period is the ―ALTRV Void if Aircraft Not Airborne‖ time (AVANA). This ensures
      separation between aircraft. Unless otherwise specified, AVANA is 1 hour after ALTRV
      published departure time.
      8.4.1.4. If a mission is delayed beyond AVANA, rescheduling normally is by 24 hour
      increments based on the original departure time. It may be less provided the Central
      Altitude Reservation Function (CARF) and affected air traffic control agencies concur.
      8.4.1.5. An ALTRV does not preclude ATC from using ALTRV airspace provided
      standard separation is applied between all aircraft.
      8.4.1.6. ALTRV Format. See FAA 7610.4, Special Military Operations.
   8.4.2. Refer to ATP-56(B), Part 1 for ALTRV filing and employment information.
8.5. Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft (MARSA).
   8.5.1. Acceptance of MARSA normally is the tanker's responsibility. MARSA begins when
   requested by the tanker and approved by the controlling air traffic service. This is usually
   done prior to the air-to-air refueling initial point (ARIP) or rendezvous initial point (RVIP)
   for AAR conducted on published tracks. When a rendezvous is conducted in an area that
   does not use a normal AAR track or anchor rendezvous (RV Alpha) procedures, MARSA
   begins when participating aircraft enter the refueling airspace.
   8.5.2. MARSA ends when normal separation standards are established and ATC accepts
   control at the end of refueling.
8.6. Planning Factors. Mission planners will provide the aircrews with coordinates for the
AAR entry point (AREP), ARIP/RVIP, AAR control point (ARCP), and AAR exit point (AAR
EXIT PT).
   8.6.1. Primary control time for a point parallel rendezvous (RV Delta) will be the time the
   receiver arrives at the ARCP. This is designated as the AAR control time (ARCT). Primary
   control time for an enroute rendezvous (RV Golf) will be the time the receiver arrives at the
   RVIP. This is designated as the rendezvous control time (RVCT). For both RV Delta and
   RV Golf, the ARCT is used as the emergency or missed rendezvous reference time.
   8.6.2. Both tanker and receiver crews must be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of
   refueling in order to adequately plan the mission. Crew members will receive a weather
   forecast for the AAR area so that alternate plans can be utilized when the primary track is
   unsuitable. AAR tracks should be planned to coincide with receiver’s route of flight, when
   possible. Also, both tanker and receiver crews must be thoroughly familiar with the
   following in order to adequately plan the mission:
      8.6.2.1. AAR ARIP.
      8.6.2.2. AAR Track.
      8.6.2.3. AAR ARCP.
 76                                                     AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


      8.6.2.4. AAR ARCT.
      8.6.2.5. AAR Altitudes.
      8.6.2.6. AAR Abort Point.
      8.6.2.7. AAR EXIT PT.
      8.6.2.8. Recovery and Emergency Bases.
      8.6.2.9. Tanker and Receiver Call Signs.
      8.6.2.10. Standby Tanker Requirements.
      8.6.2.11. Formation and Individual Tactics.
      8.6.2.12. Rendezvous/AAR Frequencies and Beacon Settings.
      8.6.2.13. Fuel Onload Requirements.
      8.6.2.14. Air Traffic Control Clearance Limits.
   8.6.3. Normally conduct air-to-air refueling on an IFR clearance. Refueling may be
   conducted under VFR when coordinated with the controlling ARTCC. Air-to-air refueling
   under Due Regard should only be done as a last resort when operational requirements dictate.
   These procedures are permitted only with tanker concurrence.
8.7. Communications:
   8.7.1. During all AAR, the PIC will designate one crew member as the primary monitor for
   ATC. This crew member will be responsible for writing down any clearance issued to the
   tanker for the receiver aircraft. The PIC will ensure the receiver and the tanker are on the
   same frequency. The PIC will ensure the accuracy of the clearance. Reference ATP-56(B)
   Part 1 for additional communication/EMCON information.
8.8. Oral Communications. With the exception of the breakaway calls, crew members may
shorten individual call signs using only the number. Example: TERRA 11 (one-one) would be
11 (one-one).
   8.8.1. The communications requirements should be established prior to the flight. Normally
   boom visual signals will be used exclusively; however; if required or requested by the
   receiver, the boom operator will begin communications when the receiver reaches
   approximately fifty feet from the contact position. Direction, if required, will precede
   distance for receiver to move and will be given until receiver reaches the contact position.
   Example: ―Forward 50‖, ―Up 4‖, ―Back 2‖.
   8.8.2. For Emission Option 1 and 2, the boom operator will make a precontact radio check
   with the receiver and the receiver will acknowledge. Example: Tanker will say 62/15 (six-
   two, one-five), receiver will reply 15 (one-five).
   8.8.3. Refer to ATP-56(B) Part 1 for a full description of communication procedures.
   8.8.4. Emission Option 3. The following procedures apply specifically when operating
   under Emission Option 3.
      8.8.4.1. Mission Planning. The elimination of the 15-minute prior call increases the
      element of risk, and the following guidelines should enhance safety considerations.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                    77


       8.8.4.2. Normally accomplish when clear of clouds.
       8.8.4.3. If unable to remain clear of clouds, tanker(s) and receiver will immediately
       confirm altitudes.
       8.8.4.4. The receiver and tanker inbound courses to the RV/ARIP must be separated by a
       minimum of 30 degrees.
       8.8.4.5. The receiver and tanker inbound legs to the RV/ARIP must be a minimum of 40
       NM in length.
       8.8.4.6. The type rendezvous should be an en route rendezvous at the RVIP with both
       aircraft using the same RV time. The receiver should rendezvous 1,000 feet below the
       tanker. An estimated time in route (ETE) from the RV/ARIP to the ARCP should be
       planned which permits an airspeed that falls in the middle of aircraft speed performance
       envelope. It is essential that crews/planners coordinate certain items during mission
       planning/development. Minimum items include:
           8.8.4.6.1. Rendezvous altitudes.
           8.8.4.6.2. RV time and ARCT.
           8.8.4.6.3. Inbound courses to the RV/ARIP.
           8.8.4.6.4. Radio silent termination time in the event of a missed rendezvous.
       8.8.4.7. Once departing the RVIP, the tanker should fly centerline. The receiver is the
       maneuvering aircraft. If the tanker is behind the receiver, the tanker should accelerate
       and pass slightly off the left wing of the receiver. Once the tanker boom operator has a
       good visual and there is no doubt that the receiver has a good visual, the tanker will
       establish AAR speed.
       8.8.4.8. Missed Rendezvous Procedures. If contact is not established at the RV/ARIP
       the tanker or receiver should arrive at the ARCP at the ARCT. This procedure begins
       when either aircraft arrives at the ARCP and does not have visual contact with the other.
       In this case a left-hand orbit should be entered and orbit controlled so as to be over the
       ARCP at intervals of every eight minutes (ARCT plus eight, plus sixteen, etc). While in
       the orbit, every attempt should be made to establish visual contact with the other aircraft.
       The length of delay and decision as to how long to continue radio silence should be
       determined during mission planning/development prior to flight.
8.9. Visual Signals. Radio silent refueling can be conducted by use of visual signals provided
precaution and procedures are observed. Refer to ATP-56(B) Part 1 for a full description of
visual signals. Descriptions and diagrams of tanker lighting pilot director lights (PDL) for the
KC-135/KC-10 can be found in ATP-56(B) Annex ZA and ZB, respectively.
8.10. Lighting:
   8.10.1. While accomplishing a rendezvous and descent during hours of darkness or during
   periods of limited visibility, the receiver will have the following exterior lights set to aid in
   visual acquisition. The receiver’s position and anti-collision lights will be ON. Applicable
   tanker external lights will be turned on at least 15 minutes prior to the latest known receiver
   ETA for the rendezvous point. As the receiver approaches the precontact position, the flight
   deck lights will be dimmed as required, and the upper beacon light turned OFF. While
 78                                                       AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


   approaching the contact position, the intensity of receiver slipway lights can be adjusted as
   requested by the boom operator. Diagrams of tanker lighting and pilot director lights (PDL)
   for the KC-135/KC-10 can be found in ATP-56(B) Annex ZA and ZB, respectively. NOTE:
   Visual contact for night AAR (NAAR) can be aided by requesting the tanker flash his
   landing light prior to and/or during the tanker turn.
   8.10.2. Single tankers performing a rendezvous will always display red/white in the upper
   and lower rendezvous beacon lights. The spare tanker will not display a rendezvous beacon
   light during the rendezvous. However, if the spare tanker is used during AAR, the
   appropriate color code will be displayed until the receiver is in the precontact position. To
   further aid in identification, tanker position lights will be BRIGHT and FLASHING for
   numbers 1 and 3 and will be BRIGHT and STEADY for 2 and 4. After the receiver has
   established visual contact and has closed to 1/2 NM in trail, tankers will turn position lights
   to STEADY and DIM and turn lower rotating beacon lights OFF. When any aircraft will be
   flying visual wing formation on the tanker, the tanker will also turn off the upper rotating
   beacon. See Figure 8.1.

Table 8.1. Tanker Identification Lighting.
       Tanker Number                                        Light Color
                                             Upper                            Lower
               1                               Red                              Red
               2                              White                            White
               3                            Red-White                        Red-White
               4                              White                              Red
   8.10.3. Pilot Director Lights. The director lights do not give true vertical and horizontal
   information. The up-and-down lights change because of angular movement of the boom and
   the fore-and-aft lights change because of in-and-out movements of the boom. The axis of the
   director light system is inclined at a 30-degree angle to the tanker fuselage. The angle causes
   an indication in both lights when the receiver makes a true vertical or horizontal movement.
   For example, flying forward while in contact will cause the boom to compress and also
   increase its angle with the tanker fuselage. The lights will show that the aircraft is flying
   forward and down. If a true up movement is made, the boom will compress and also lessen
   its angle with the tanker fuselage giving a combined up and forward indication from the
   lights. When this interaction between lights is understood, it can be used to advantage in
   keeping position. Small fore-and-aft corrections can be made with little or no power change
   by moving vertically. The pilot director lights will remain illuminated and follow boom
   movements in both the contact made and disconnect conditions. Pilot director lights are on
   the bottom of the left row for elevation and the right row for telescoping. The triangular
   shaped panels are for elevation and the rectangular shaped panels are for forward and back
   movement. The elevation lights consist of five colored panels with a green stripe, green and
   red colors, and two illuminated letters: D and U for Down and Up respectively.
   8.10.4. Background lights are located behind the panels. The colored panels are illuminated
   by lights controlled by boom elevation during contact. On the telescoping side, background
   lights do not illuminate the colored panels. There is an illuminated white panel between each
   panel to serve as a reference. The A for aft and F for forward augment the colored panels on
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                  79


   the telescoping side. The receiver pilot director lights will remain illuminated and follow
   boom movements in both contact and disconnect conditions. There are no lights for azimuth
   position. The pilot may use a fluorescent yellow stripe on the bottom center of the tanker
   fuselage as a centerline reference.
8.11. Boom Envelope Limits. The AAR boom envelope is the operational limits dictated by
the aerodynamic control authority of the boom. As long as the receiver is positioned inside the
limits, contact can be held despite rolling, yawing, or pitching. The envelope limits are set well
within mechanical limits of the boom so that disconnect will normally take place before any
structural damage occurs. Reference ATP-56(B) Annex ZA for KC-135 and Annex ZB for KC-
10 boom envelope diagrams. CAUTION: Approaching boom limits at relatively high velocity
can cause structural damage due to binding action of the boom nozzle.

Table 8.2. Boom Envelope Limits.
                                      Boom Envelope Limits
                     KC-135                                         KC-10
 Upper Limit: 20 Degrees                  Elevation        Upper Limit: 20 Degrees
 Lower Limit: 40 Degrees                                   Lower limit: 40 Degrees
 Right and Left Limit: 10 Degrees         Azimuth          Right and Left Limit: 25 Degrees
 Inner Limit: 6 Feet                     Telescopic        Inner Limit: 6 Feet
 Outer Limit: 18 Feet                                      Outer Limit: 21 Feet
NOTE: The lower limit (KC-135) is reduce to 35 when less than 4 units of boom trim are used.
8.12. Rendezvous Procedures: NOTE: To enhance visual tanker acquisition, the receiver or
ground agency controlling the rendezvous may request the tanker to jettison fuel (mark). It
should only be used if a receiver low fuel state or other similar circumstances require the
rendezvous be expedited.
   8.12.1. Refer to ATP-56(B) Part 1 for a full description of rendezvous procedures.
   8.12.2. Rendezvous B and C procedures will not be trained or executed by USAF aircraft.
   Refer to ATP-56(B) preliminaries. WARNING: When adverse weather is encountered in
   the rendezvous area, the search radar should be used for weather scan, rather than for
   monitoring or directing the rendezvous.
   8.12.3. Normal Rendezvous Procedures.         Normal rendezvous procedures and reference
   information for the C-32B are as follows:
       8.12.3.1. Rendezvous Alpha (Anchor RV)               ATP-56(B) Part 2 Annex 1A
       8.12.3.2. Rendezvous Delta (Point Parallel RV)       ATP-56(B) Part 2 Annex 1D
       8.12.3.3. Rendezvous Golf (Enroute RV)               ATP-56(B) Part 2 Annex 1G
   8.12.4. Alternate Rendezvous Means. When primary means are not available, or are lost,
   alternate means will be utilized to perform the rendezvous. When using alternate means, the
   tankers and receivers will fly the same profiles as described in ATP-56(B). The following
   are some suggested alternate means for conducting the rendezvous. The various alternate
   means should be used in conjunction with each other when equipment availability permits,
   and when practical, to ensure a successful rendezvous (i.e., common VORTAC, TACAN
   DME, Radar Beacon, and FAA/GCI advisories, etc).
 80                                                        AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


       8.12.4.1. FAA/GCI Facilities, when available, may be used for vector and separation
       advisories.
       8.12.4.2. DME/Radial information from a common TACAN/VORTAC may be
       exchanged, with the final turn to refueling track being accomplished when the DME
       difference equals proper turn range.
       8.12.4.3. When adequate navigational checkpoints are available, tanker may adjust final
       orbit pattern to arrive over the ARCP on refueling heading at receivers ETA to the
       ARCP.
       8.12.4.4. As soon as reliable radio contact has been established between aircraft,
       DME/Radial information from a common TACAN/VORTAC station will be exchanged,
       if available.
   8.12.5. Descent and Closure. The receiver will begin descent to an altitude 1,000 feet below
   the assigned air refueling altitude no later than the ARIP. The receiver should descend at
   2,500 fpm. Establish Mach 0.85 or 310 KIAS, whichever is lower, through level-off to a
   point two NMs from the tanker. This level-off altitude will be maintained until one NM from
   the tanker and visual contact has been established at which time a gradual climb to precontact
   position will be initiated, arriving at 1/2 NM in trail with a minimum altitude separation of
   500 feet. The receiver should maintain 310 KIAS until the following ranges vs. airspeed
   schedules apply. (Table 8.3)

Table 8.3. Airspeed Schedule.
  >1 NM                     Mach 0.85 or 310 KIAS, whichever is lower
  1 NM                      Mach 0.83 or 290 KIAS, whichever is lower
  1/2 NM                    Mach 0.81 or 285 KIAS, whichever is lower
  Contact                   Mach 0.80 or 275 KIAS, whichever is lower
WARNING: Tankers will maintain applicable contact air refueling airspeed during closure. If
within one NM closure the tanker is off airspeed by more than ten knots and required to
decelerate or accelerate to obtain contact airspeed, the receiver pilot will be informed prior to
tanker airspeed changes.

NOTE: If the receiver is more than four NM in trail with the tanker, the airspeed may be,
increased to 330 KIAS for closure. The normal speed schedule should be resumed at 1 NM in
trail.
       8.12.5.1. During deceleration, it is imperative the airspeed schedule be maintained. The
       nonflying pilot will pass the range calls to the receiver pilot at three, two, one, and 1/2
       NM.
   8.12.6. Rendezvous Overrun. Upon recognition, either aircraft can direct or terminate
   overrun procedures. Receiver will reduce airspeed to 255 KIAS and maintain track and
   altitude. Tanker will increase airspeed to 310 KIAS, maintain altitude, adjust track as
   required, and overtake the receiver. After overtaking the receiver and terminating the
   overrun, the tanker will reduce the airspeed to 275 KIAS for final receiver closure.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                   81


       8.12.6.1. Early Arrival of Receiver. In the event the receiver arrives ahead of the tanker
       at the ARIP, ARCP, or RV point, the receiver will obtain ATC clearance to orbit at an
       altitude that ensures at least 1,000 feet separation between tanker and receiver.
8.13. Additional AAR Procedures. The following information pertains to different aspects of
AAR including Receiver Pilot Technique, Fuel Transfer Rate, Refueling Formations, Normal
Crew Procedures, and Pilot Refueling Procedures.
   8.13.1. Slipway Door Procedures. To prevent freezing, the slipway door should be cycled
   open and closed prior to passing 10,000 feet MSL.
   8.13.2. Receiver Pilot Technique. The receiver pilot will establish a rate of deceleration in
   sufficient time to allow a zero rate of closure at the precontact position. WARNING: The
   receiver will stabilize in the precontact position with a zero rate of closure. If the receiver
   fails to attain stabilized position, or it becomes apparent that a closure overrun will occur, a
   breakaway will be initiated. Failure to initiate a breakaway under closure overrun conditions
   can result in a mid-air collision. Because of the magnitude of interrelated aerodynamic
   effects, flying two aircraft in close vertical proximity is not safe. Upwash and downwash
   effects may occur drawing the aircraft together. Low-pressure areas created by an
   overrunning receiver flying under the tanker will affect static ports causing possible
   erroneous airspeed and altitude indications to both aircraft. The tanker autopilot altitude hold
   function may sense the low pressure as a climbing indication and initiate a descent into the
   lower aircraft.
   8.13.3. Once the precontact position is attained, the receiver pilot should make necessary
   corrections to line the receiver up with the tanker fuselage centerline and dampen all relative
   lateral movement of the receiver aircraft. Closure from precontact to the contact position
   should be made very slowly (approximately 1 foot per second) to enable both the tanker
   pilot/autopilot and the receiver pilot to compensate for the required trim changes. The proper
   technique is to fly formation using the forward fuselage and wings of the tanker as visual
   references, crosscheck the pilot director light signals, and use the boom operator’s directions
   as necessary to judge the location of the receiver in the envelope. Anytime lateral
   movement, pitch oscillations, or rate of closure become excessive, reduce power and drop
   back into precontact position and stabilize the aircraft. As the receiver reaches the contact
   position, the receiver pilot should hold a steady platform until the boom is in the slipway.
   CAUTION: If the pilot director lights fail to illuminate when contact is established, the
   receiver pilot will inform the boom operator if he wishes to continue refueling operations. If
   refueling is continued, verbal corrections from the boom operator may be requested.
   CAUTION: Attempts to affect a contact during loss of any AAR lighting that results in less
   than desired illumination will be at the discretion of the boom operator.
   8.13.4. The AAR boom envelope is the operational limits dictated by the aerodynamic
   control authority of the boom. Rough usage of controls on the part of either receiver or
   tanker pilot will cause a chain reaction with progressively larger corrections required to
   maintain position. Therefore, development of a smooth technique is necessary. Envelope
   limits are set well within mechanical limits of the boom so that a disconnect will normally
   take place, soon enough to allow ample time for a separation. Avoid extreme azimuth
   disconnects at all times. Reference ATP-56(B) Annex ZA for KC-135 and Annex ZB for
   KC-10 boom envelope diagrams. CAUTION: Approaching boom limits at relatively high
 82                                                        AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


   velocity can cause structural damage as a result of an inability to disconnect due to binding
   action of the boom nozzle.
   8.13.5. Pilot director lights are used in conjunction with visual references to maintain the
   optimum position. The receiver pilot must be familiar with operation of the pilot director
   lights and the fact that they do not give true vertical and horizontal information.
   8.13.6. Turns and banks may be made during contact without disconnects provided no large
   or abrupt motions or throttle movements are made by either tanker or receiver.
   8.13.7. The lateral control spoilers introduce a pitch up movement, but during AAR
   operations, this characteristic is not objectionable. During AAR in rough air, it may be
   necessary to apply a small amount of elevator to offset the pitch tendency if a large amount
   of lateral correction is rapidly made.
   8.13.8. Maintain position by making small anticipated corrections. Once the receiver pilot
   establishes his visual references, a crosscheck between the pilot director lights and any
   change in position indicated by visual references will indicate the magnitude and direction of
   corrections. As a guide, the movement of the nose of the tanker may be used to gauge
   required elevator inputs. Lateral control is accomplished by proper aileron inputs to maintain
   a parallel wing condition with the tanker. Power corrections are based upon the magnitude
   and direction of any movement fore or aft relative to the tanker.
   8.13.9. Pilot Fatigue. One of the greatest potential hazards during AAR is fatigue. If for any
   reason large oscillations develop which require increasing amounts of control displacement,
   disconnect and let the other pilot fly the aircraft in the precontact position for a few minutes.
   The time spent in stabilizing and resting will result in better air refueling in a shorter time,
   since fewer disconnects will be experienced.
8.14. Disconnect. There are two major classifications of disconnects; planned and inadvertent.
Planned disconnects may be initiated by the receiver pilot, copilot, or tanker boom operator
activating the disconnect switch. Disconnects may be initiated by the receiver if less than a full
load is required, if a malfunction is suspected, or for training purposes. If a prearranged quantity
of fuel is to be transferred, the disconnect will be initiated by the tanker boom operator after the
planned amount of fuel is transferred and the receiver pilot is notified.
   8.14.1. Inadvertent disconnects may be caused by exceeding the refueling boom envelope
   limits. A pressure disconnect switch will cause a disconnect if excessive pressure surges
   occur either from transfer pressure or when the selected tanks become full and the high-level
   float switches close. Upon disconnect, the boom will automatically retract, except when
   using manual boom retract.
   8.14.2. When a disconnect occurs, the disconnect light illuminates and the contact made
   light goes out. In case of an inadvertent disconnect, depress and release the reset button for
   the ready light. The blue ready light will illuminate, the amber disconnect light will go out,
   and the green contact made light will be out.
   8.14.3. To disconnect in an emergency, the receiver pilot and copilot must be prepared at all
   times to press the autopilot/AAR boom disconnect buttons. CAUTION: Unless a serious
   emergency arises, every effort should be made to stay in contact position until certain that the
   boom is clear of the receptacle. Remain stabilized in the contact position until the boom
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                    83


   operator or pilot not flying the aircraft visually confirms a disconnect has been made. This
   will prevent damage to the boom and/or receptacle through a brute force disconnect.
   NOTE: In the event of failure to obtain a contact and after each disconnect, the receiver will
   move aft and stabilize in a position in trail of the boom or in pre-contact position, reset AAR
   system and await boom operator signal to return to the contact position.
8.15. Air Refueling Formations. Refer to ATP-56(B) Part 2 Annex 2D.
8.16. Emergency Air Refueling Procedures. The following paragraphs describe emergency
AAR procedures including tanker aborts, emergency disconnects, systems malfunctions, and
breakaway procedures.
   8.16.1. Tanker Abort. A tanker aborting during air refueling will inform the receiver and the
   tanker lead (if necessary), and make a slow descending turn to clear the formation and
   proceed on briefed route or take action as required by the abort.
   8.16.2. If a receiver aborts, all available means will be used to advise the tanker, particularly
   if radio contact between tanker and receiver has not been established. When in radio contact
   with tanker, an aborting receiver will advise tanker leader so that appropriate action can be
   taken.
   8.16.3. Emergency Disconnect. The receiver pilot must be prepared to press the boom
   disconnect switch at all times while flying AAR. The other hand must be readily available
   for immediate throttle actuation in the event of a breakaway. Unless a serious emergency
   arises, every effort should be made to stay in contact position until certain that the boom
   nozzle is clear of the receptacle.
   8.16.4. Systems Malfunctions. If a tanker AAR system malfunction precludes transfer of
   fuel during AAR, the tanker will stow the boom, inform the receiver, and state the amount of
   fuel transferred. Remaining tankers with operational AAR systems and transferable fuel will
   advise the tanker leader as to the amount of fuel that can be transferred. NOTE: When any
   system malfunction or condition exists which could jeopardize safety, AAR will not be
   accomplished except during fuel emergencies or when continuance of AAR is dictated by
   operational necessity.
   8.16.5. AAR System Failure:
      8.16.5.1. Failure to Disconnect. It is possible, though not probable, that the tanker signal
      system may change to disconnect while the receiver signal system stays in contact-made.
      For this remote possibility and other emergencies which might arise, the receiver pilot
      must be prepared at all times to press his autopilot/AAR boom disconnect switch
      instantly.
      8.16.5.2. Manual Boom Latching. If either the boom operator or the receiver pilot is
      unable to accomplish disconnect or if the blue ready-for-contact light stays ON or comes
      back ON after contact has been established, the receiver must place the signal amplifier
      power switch in the override position and inform the boom operator of UARRSI failure.
      In this condition the receiver pilots are the ones capable of performing a disconnect.
      Continuation of refueling in this condition is for operational missions only and will
      comply with the procedures below. NOTE: An AAR system malfunction is indicated by
 84                                                      AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


      the blue ready-for-contact light staying on or coming back on. In certain cases; however,
      a malfunction may occur and not be indicated in this manner.
          8.16.5.2.1. Inform tanker crew that AAR will take place with receiver signal amp in
          override mode.
          8.16.5.2.2. Fly receiver into contact position with signal amplifier power switch in
          OVRD position. OVRD Light - On. Ready (Blue) Light – On.
          8.16.5.2.3. Boom operator will place boom nozzle in bottom of air to air refueling
          receptacle and advise receiver pilot, "(Tanker call sign) contact."
          8.16.5.2.4. Contact-Made (Green) Light – On.
          8.16.5.2.5. Receiver pilot will advise tanker boom operator "(Receiver call sign)
          contact."
          8.16.5.2.6. Proceed with normal AAR methods. Tanker boom operator will advise
          receiver pilot of corrective action to be used to remain within AAR envelope.
          8.16.5.2.7. When fuel transfer has been completed, tanker boom operator will call,"
          (Tanker call sign) disconnect.‖
          8.16.5.2.8. Receiver pilot will disconnect by depressing boom disconnect button to
          release toggles and inform tanker boom operator." (Receiver call sign) disconnect."
          CAUTION: The boom operator is unable to release the boom toggles during SIG
          AMP OVRD.
      8.16.5.3. Brute Force Disconnect. There are two types of brute force disconnect,
      controlled tension and inadvertent. Refer to ATP-56(B) Part 2 Annex ZA for
      descriptions. CAUTION: A brute force disconnect is a last resort. CAUTION: It is not
      necessary to jerk the boom out with IDLE power and speed brakes. This method has
      caused serious structural damage. A gradual reduction in power will suffice to
      disconnect.
      8.16.5.4. Pressure Refueling. Inoperative Boom/Receptacle Latching. When all other
      recognized means of fuel transfer have failed, and a bona fide fuel shortage emergency
      aboard the receiver aircraft exists, fuel can be transferred maintaining boom/receptacle
      contact using a slight extend pressure on the boom telescope lever. CAUTION: Prior to
      attempting this method of transferring fuel, the boom operator will brief the receiver pilot
      and thoroughly coordinate the procedures to be used. Both tanker and receiver crews will
      monitor the refueling with extreme caution.
          8.16.5.4.1. The boom operator must apply only the minimum required extend
          pressure to maintain adequate boom/receptacle seal, preventing excessive fuel
          leakage. Unusual and varying trim changes may be required of both tanker and
          receiver aircraft. Excessive pressure may push receiver aircraft outward and place
          undue stress on the boom telescope mechanism.
          8.16.5.4.2. The boom operator must anticipate receiver relative movement to
          maintain contact during receiver deceleration and must be especially alert to relieve
          extend pressure during sudden receiver closure.
8.17. Breakaway Procedure: Refer to ATP-56(B) Part 2 Chapter 4.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                   85


   8.17.1. Relative position of both aircraft must be closely monitored by all crew members
   during all phases of AAR. When either a tanker or receiver crew member determines that an
   abnormal condition exists which requires an immediate separation of the aircraft, they will
   transmit the breakaway call on AAR frequency. This will include, but not be limited to,
   excessive rate of closure, closure overrun, and engine failure.
   8.17.2. The aircraft do not necessarily have to be in contact-made to call a breakaway.
   During loss of communications, the crew member desiring a breakaway, or observing the
   tanker initiating a breakaway, will transmit the breakaway call on interphone.
   8.17.3. For all breakaways, transmit the tanker's call sign and the word "Breakaway" three
   times (Example: "TERRA 32, breakaway, breakaway, breakaway") and simultaneously take
   the following actions, as indicated.
   8.17.4. Receiver Pilots. Both pilots actuate disconnect switches. The pilot flying position
   throttles to IDLE and establish a definite rate of descent; add drag, if necessary. Avoid under
   flying the tanker if possible and drop aft of tanker until entire tanker is in sight. Then pilot
   flying should monitor flight instruments while pilot not flying monitors the tanker.
   WARNING: The receiver pilot should use caution not to overrun the tanker. If overrunning
   does occur, under no conditions should a turn, either right or left, be made until breakaway
   has been completed.
8.18. Post AAR. Refer to ATP-56(B) Part 1 (definition) and Part 2 Chapter 1.
   8.18.1. The tanker will give post AAR information to the receiver as required. The receiver
   will advise the tanker of any pilot director light malfunctions/deficiencies, e.g., lights
   intermittent, inoperative, dim, dirty, etc. Upon termination of AAR, all exterior lights will be
   operated as required. WARNING: If required to accelerate and climb on the refueling
   heading the receiver will maneuver either left or right (minimum of one NM) of the tanker(s)
   prior to accelerating and climbing. This will preclude the departing receiver’s jet wash from
   causing injury to personnel or damage to the tankers.
8.19. KC-10 AAR Procedures. The following items of information are provided to amplify
only the differences to KC-135 tanker procedures contained herein.
   8.19.1. Pilot Director Lights, KC-10. The pilot director lights consist of two rows of lights
   located forward of the wing root. Relative elevation position is provided by the left row and
   the right row provides telescoping position. The elevation row contains one striped green,
   two amber, and two red triangular panels, and two white letters, (U) for up and (D) at the aft
   end for down. The colored panels and letters are dimly illuminated by background lights.
   The telescoping row contains one striped green, two amber, two red, and four white
   rectangular panels and two white letters, (A) at the aft end for Aft, and (F) at the aft end for
   Forward. The colored panels do not have background lighting, however, the letter at each
   end of the row is dimly illuminated. Separation is provided by the white panels. The pilot
   director lights are adjusted by the boom operator to the size air to AAR envelope, for each
   receiver and provide guidance during contact.
   8.19.2. To provide more response time, the appropriate panel and letter are illuminated in
   anticipation of receiver movement. The director lights provide commands based on both
   receiver position and rate of movement. With rapid motions of the receiver the lights can
   show a correction required even though the receiver is in the center of the envelope. The red
86                                                        AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


  panel and letter at the ends of each row can be illuminated by the boom operator to aid the
  receiver in attaining the contact position.
  8.19.3. Handling Characteristics. More power will be required to maintain position than
  usual behind a KC-135 tanker. A stronger centering tendency exists behind the KC-10 as
  compared to the KC-135 when the receiver is left or right of the tanker centerline.
  8.19.4. Disconnect. The KC-10 aerial refueling boom is controlled by a digital fly-by-wire
  system. Certain failure conditions of this system may cause one or more axis of the boom
  control system to become inoperative. Should this occur, the boom operator may not be able
  to maneuver the boom to avoid striking the receiver aircraft. In this situation, the boom
  operator will direct the receiver to a position where a safe disconnect can be effected.
  WARNING: When notified that a KC-10 boom flight control system failure has occurred,
  do not initiate a disconnect unless directed by the boom operator. Follow the boom
  operator's instructions explicitly. To reduce the probability of boom strike after disconnect, it
  may be necessary to remain in a stabilized position to allow for aerodynamic fairing of the
  boom control surfaces. WARNING: Due to the possibility of causing uncommanded boom
  movement, no HF transmissions are to be made when in close proximity or connected to the
  KC-10 boom.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                     87

                      LOADMASTER PROCEDURES AND FORMS

12.1. General. In addition to the duties established in the FCOM Volume 1 and other
directives, the loadmaster will comply with the procedures and duties in this regulation. The PIC
may assign other duties as necessary. The loadmaster will:
   12.1.1. Coordinate loading and offloading with air terminal operations or the shipping
   agency.
   12.1.2. Load plan and supervise loading, tiedown, and offloading of cargo, baggage, mission
   equipment, and passengers.
   12.1.3. Be assigned to the crew anytime passengers or cargo are being transported aboard the
   aircraft.  MAJCOM/A3 may waive this requirement when necessary for mission
   accomplishment.
12.2. Responsibility for Aircraft Loading:
   12.2.1. Shippers are responsible for providing documentation for cargo and personnel. They
   will advise the loadmaster of size, weight and type of cargo (classified, hazardous, etc.),
   coordinate traffic activities that may affect loading and offloading, and assign sufficient
   personnel for cargo handling. Shippers, under the aircraft loadmaster’s supervision are
   responsible for safe positioning of material handling equipment and cargo to and from the
   aircraft. If cargo, aircraft equipment, or aircraft structure is damaged during loading or
   offloading, or if loading personnel are injured, the loadmaster will stop the loading operation
   and notify the PIC.
   12.2.2. The loadmaster is responsible for aircraft preflight, load planning, preparation of
   weight and balance forms, operation of aircraft equipment, coordination with loading crew
   supervisor for inspection of cargo and documentation, and supervision and direction of
   loading, offloading, and tiedown. The loadmaster directs loading and is responsible for safe
   movement of cargo into and out of the aircraft.
12.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Load aircraft in such a manner that the following
emergency exits are available:
   12.3.1. At least one unobstructed emergency exit per 20 passengers. At least two
   unobstructed emergency exits equipped with escape slides must be useable (one forward and
   one aft).
   12.3.2. When cargo or baggage is being loaded into the aircraft cabin, allow for a clear
   emergency egress aisle from the cockpit door to the aft most exit.
12.4. Air Cargo Restraint Criteria. Cargo will be loaded and restrained in the cargo holds
when possible. A safety belt or other tiedown strong enough to prevent shifting of cargo under
all normal flight and ground conditions may be used.
   12.4.1. Cargo hold compartmental netting will be used to secure cargo when available.
12.5. Passenger Handling:
 94                                                       AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


   12.5.1. The loadmaster is the key figure concerning good passenger relations, and is
   responsible for the passenger's safety and security during loading, offloading and flight.
   Loadmasters are also responsible for ensuring only authorized personnel are allowed on
   board the aircraft. Be aware of any doubts and fears that may arise in the minds of personnel
   and anticipate their questions and actions. Offer support and perform duties in a professional
   manner and show a personal interest and willingness to assist passengers.
   12.5.2. Passengers may move about the cabin, however, judgment must be exercised on the
   number of passengers allowed out of their seats at one time. Encourage passengers to keep
   seat belts fastened when seated. If passengers are allowed to move freely in the cabin at
   cruise altitude good judgment must be exercised allowing the crew access to emergency
   equipment. In all such cases a clear aisle way from the front of the aircraft to the rear of the
   aircraft must be maintained at all times.
   12.5.3. Do not allow passengers to lounge on or tamper with equipment, cargo, or baggage.
   Additionally passenger bags will be stored in the overhead bins or under the seats in front of
   them for takeoffs and landings.
   12.5.4. Make frequent checks on the cabin temperature and the cleanliness of the cabin and
   lavatories. Special emphasis must be placed on removing and properly securing or
   destroying all classified or sensitive refuse.
   12.5.5. On flights of long duration, particularly during hours of darkness, use all possible
   means to make passengers comfortable. Dim lights and extinguish unnecessary cabin lights.
   12.5.6. Passengers may visit the flight deck when approved by the PIC. Good judgment
   must be used when authorizing cockpit visitation.
   12.5.7. Any time passengers are on board, one loadmaster will be awake in the cabin to
   monitor cabin activities and maintain cabin discipline and safety. While on the ground the
   AMSS will monitor all passengers if both loadmasters are required for loading operations.
12.6. Border Clearance. Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture require certain forms for
border clearance. The loadmaster is the custodian of all border clearance forms. Distribute the
forms to the crew and passengers and ensure their completion prior to landing. A crew member
will give completed forms to proper authorities.
12.7. Weight and Balance:
   12.7.1. Responsibility for the weight and balance rests with the pilot, although this is
   normally delegated to the loadmaster. The index system for calculating weight and balance
   will be used. The primary loadmaster onboard is responsible for ensuring a center of gravity
   (CG) is computed and presented to the cockpit prior to engine start. Canned weight and
   balance forms may be used if they reflect the current crew, fuel, passengers, and cargo
   onboard. For home station departures, a copy of the weight and balance is normally filed
   with the pre-mission paperwork. On continuing missions, the completed weight and balance
   form is maintained onboard and properly disposed of when no longer needed. NOTE: The
   loadmaster will make every effort to notify the AMSS with the following information.
   (Crew count, passenger count, cargo load, and any other pertinent information deemed
   necessary) The AMSS will relay the information to command and control agency as soon as
   practical.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                  95


   12.7.2. Unit DOV is the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for weight and balance. All
   weight and balance books will be maintained and updated by the OPR and a copy provided to
   AFSOC/A3VS. Each weight and balance book will be reviewed semi-annually for currency.
12.8. Loadmaster Forms. All forms are maintained in the loadmaster trip kit. The kit contents
will be checked prior to departure from home station to ensure sufficient quantities of required
forms. Required forms are specified on the index sheet located in the loadmaster trip kit. Unit
DOV is OPR for the loadmaster trip kit.
12.9. Emergency Equipment. Emergency equipment requirements are identified in the aircraft
operations manual, loadmaster's preflight checklist, and aircraft Minimum Equipment List
(MEL).
12.10. Aircraft Tiedown Equipment. Required tiedown equipment is identified in the
loadmaster's preflight checklist.
12.11. Baggage Loading System. The baggage loading system is designed to load baggage at
austere locations that do not have adequate material handling equipment available. The
loadmaster must coordinate with the aircraft/mission commander prior to employing the system.
   12.11.1. The Boeing Cargo Loading Manual provides a chart showing the acceptable length,
   width, and height of baggage that can safely be loaded in the aft cargo hold. This chart does
   not reflect reductions of the cargo door opening due to the installment of the baggage loading
   system. This chart may still be used for planning purposes, but may not accurately reflect the
   actual L x W x H of an item to be loaded. There are too many variables involved (i.e.,
   connecting material, stretch factors, angle of insertion) to provide a chart for all scenarios.
   The loadmaster must use experience to know if a piece of cargo can be loaded. If any doubt
   arises in the safe execution of loading an item, immediately terminate loading operations and
   notify the PIC.
   12.11.2. If multiple items are to be loaded, use a drift strap hooked to the item and a floor
   ring to position the item forward or aft in the cargo compartment.
   12.11.3. The loadmaster will inspect all components of the baggage loading system prior to
   use. Only qualified loadmasters or crew members under the supervision of an instructor
   loadmaster will utilize this system.
   12.11.4. When using the baggage loading system, loadmasters will wear gloves.
   WARNING: When lifting items, ensure area under and around the item is clear of personnel.
   WARNING: Prior to raising an item into the aircraft, ensure area is clear and there are no
   obstacles in the cargo hold that would hinder the safe movement of the cargo. WARNING:
   Ensure all required pins on the winch carriage are installed and track pins engaged prior to
   any load being applied. WARNING: Ensure a minimum of four wraps of cable is placed on
   the winch drum assembly prior to any load being applied.
12.12. Emergency Airlift:
   12.12.1. Use these procedures for emergency airlift of personnel for humanitarian reasons or
   from areas faced with enemy siege, hostile fire, or when directed by HQ AFSOC. Airlift can
   be accomplished without the use of individual seats or safety belts only when more personnel
   than seats are available.
 96                                                       AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


   12.12.2. The number of personnel seated within the cabin or cargo area will vary depending
   on individual size. If possible, seat personnel in rows facing forward and restrain with straps
   placed across the aircraft floor. Secure the straps to tiedown rings positioned in the most
   outboard seat track(s).
   12.12.3. If time allows, personal effects or baggage may be loaded on the aircraft. However,
   this may reduce the amount of personnel space available.
   12.12.4. The maximum altitude for emergency airlift of personnel is FL 420 provided
   oxygen is available for each individual.
12.13. Specific Loadmaster Responsibilities. The loadmaster trip kit will be inventoried prior
to home station departure. Ensure kit contains sufficient quantities of required forms. The
inbound loadmaster will leave a memo or note (in an obvious location) inside the kit, indicating
all items that are missing, broken, require restocking, etc. The outbound loadmaster will review
the note prior to crew stations time.
   12.13.1. Aircraft cleanliness is a crew responsibility. The loadmaster is usually designated
   as the focal point to ensure the aircraft is cleaned when needed or upon return to home
   station. All available crew members should be involved in this effort. If problems arise,
   inform the PIC.
   12.13.2. Normally, the primary loadmaster is not indicated on the flight orders. During the
   initial crew briefing, the primary loadmaster will be identified. The primary loadmaster is
   the highest qualified loadmaster logging primary, instructor or evaluator time. The primary
   loadmaster is responsible for safe mission accomplishment. There may be times when a
   qualified loadmaster is acting as the primary loadmaster, but overall responsibility rests with
   the actual primary loadmaster.
   12.13.3. Due to the unit's alert requirements, every effort must be made by each loadmaster
   to ensure the alert aircraft is mission capable at all times.
   12.13.4. PICs and loadmasters will make every effort to provide the command and control
   agency a current passenger manifest or passenger count prior to each takeoff.
12.14. Boldface/Critical Action Procedures. See Attachment 7.

responsibility of all AMSS to be cognizant of their OPSEC requirements prior to making any
communication checks.
13.5. Weather Forecasts. For all flights outside the local area, the AMSS will obtain the
destination and alternate (if applicable) forecasts, to include pressure altitude and temperature,
before reaching the equal time point and one hour prior to ETA. When marginal weather is
expected, provide the pilot with earlier forecasts and timely updates, to include alternate landing
fields. Whenever SIGMETs are received from any source, contact the nearest USAF weather
facility to determine mission applicability.
   13.5.1. ATIS, with current ―information‖ identifier, is the preferred forecast method one (1)
   hour prior to landing, where available.
13.6. AF Form 4122, Airborne Radio Log. The AMSS will complete a single AF Form 4122
for each day's flight or flights.
   13.6.1. Radio logs are normally unclassified; however, if classified information is entered
   into the radio log, it must be properly marked. Complete the log IAW paragraph 13.10 File
   completed unclassified logs chronologically in a transitory file. Dispose of logs IAW the AF
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                    99

   security directives. Maintaining log entries is the lowest mission priority.
   13.6.2. An execution checklist may be used on operational flights. Annotate times in the
   appropriate blocks, if an execution checklist is used. If the execution checklist is
   unclassified, it may be attached to the radio log in lieu of duplicate log entries. If the
   execution checklist is classified, do not attach it to the radio log unless the radio log is also
   classified. A separate radio log will be maintained at all times.
13.7. Communications Worksheet. Units will develop a local communications worksheet
specifically oriented to its mission. The AMSS will complete this locally produced
communications worksheet for all flights, IAW local instructions. The local communications
worksheet must be designed to be used both during mission planning and in-flight as a guide. At
the completion of each mission this form may be destroyed.
13.8. Airborne Mission System Specialist Information Guides (AMSSIG). AMSSIG are
used to consolidate communications information, procedures, policies, etc., for quick reference
during mission planning, preflight, in-flight, and postflight duties. Unit DOV is the approval

feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made
obstruction, terrain feature, or spot elevation) within five nautical miles of route centerline.
Outside the United States, the distance from centerline should be increased to 10 NMs in
controlled airspace. This altitude may be rounded off to the next higher 100-foot increment.
Mission Design and Series (MDS) for aircraft— The first letter identifies the mission of the
aircraft (i.e., A, E, H, M). The second letter and subsequent numbers identify the design of the
aircraft (i.e., B-52, C-141, F-15). The last letter identifies the series of aircraft (i.e., B, C, D, U).

mission.
Mission Ready Crew Member— Crew member who has successfully completed appropriate
qualification, and is maintaining qualification currency requirements of this instruction.
Operational Control (OPCON)— Transferable command authority that may be exercised by
commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is
inherent in combatant command (command authority). Operational control may be delegated
and is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving
organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and
giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes
authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to
 114                                                       AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011


accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be exercised through
the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is exercised through
subordinate joint force commanders and service and/or functional component commanders.
Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and forces and to
employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary to accomplish
assigned missions. Operational; control does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction
for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training.
Operational Missions— A mission that has as a primary purpose the direct support of
contingencies, or HQ USSOCOM and its subordinate commands. Missions executed at or above
TACC level. Operational missions termed "CLOSE WATCH" include CORONET missions and
AFI 11-221, Air Refueling Management, priority 1, 2, and 3 missions tasked by the TACC.
Other operational missions such as deployment, re-deployment, reconnaissance operations,
Operational Readiness Inspections (ORI), AMC channel or SAAM, and JA/ATT missions may
be designated "CLOSE WATCH" as necessary.
Operational Risk Management (ORM)— is a logic-based, common sense approach to making
calculated decisions on human, materiel, and environmental factors before, during, and after Air
Force operations. It enables commanders, functional managers and supervisors to maximize
operational capabilities while minimizing risks by applying a simple, systematic process
appropriate for all personnel and Air Force functions.
Operating Weight— Basic aircraft weight plus weight of crew members, crew baggage,
steward's equipment, emergency and extra equipment.
Permit to Proceed— Aircraft not cleared at the first US port of entry may move to another US
airport on a permit to proceed issued by customs officials at the first port of entry. This permit
lists the requirements to be met at the next point of landing, i.e., number of crew and passengers,
cargo not yet cleared. PICs are responsible to deliver the permit to proceed to the customs

WARNING: Fuselage doors are considered primary escape routes in an emergency landing.
Cockpit windows, door exits 3L/3R are secondary routes for crash landing/ditching. In all cases,
carefully assess the conditions.

WARNING: If the evacuation signal is not given from the cockpit and the cabin crew needs to
initiate the evacuation; the Alert button on the phone handset must be depressed, letting the
cockpit know that an evacuation is taking place. When possible, notify the cockpit by the use of
the interphone headset, telephone handset, or megaphone prior to initiating an evacuation. Turn
on the emergency exit light switch at each evacuation station.

WARNING: All additional crew members/able bodied helpers will receive a thorough briefing
as to the duties to be performed if any, during an evacuation. If time permits, consideration
should be given to obtain additional survival items (i.e., food, water, etc.)
WARNING: Exits not covered in this chart due to crew size will be delegated to able-bodied
helpers.

WARNING: The PIC will sweep the cabin from the front to rear ensuring all passengers have
evacuated and should then exit through the right aft entry door (4R) if possible.

WARNING: If assigned exits are blocked and all passenger assistance has been rendered, leave
the aircraft by any suitable exit.

WARNING: The term ―EGRESS‖ requires deployment/use of aircraft airstairs egressing to a
predetermined rally point. The term ―EVACUATION‖ requires immediate deployment and use
of slide/raft, evacuating to a predetermined rally point. In either case, the PIC or designated
representative will ensure all crew and passengers are accounted for.

NOTE: Prior to the last able bodied crew member departing the aircraft, ensure all crew
members are capable of egressing.

    C-32B PLANNED CRASH LANDING/PLANNED DITCHING BRIEFING GUIDE

A9.1. C-32B PLANNED CRASH LANDING BRIEFING (PA). The PIC has informed me
that it may be necessary to evacuate the aircraft. The following information we will give you is
to prepare you for a safe and orderly evacuation of the aircraft.
Please direct your attention to the aircrew members in the aisles.

Fasten your seatbelts (low and tight). Place your tray tables and seat backs to their upright
position, and ensure all carry-on items are properly stored (under seat or in overhead bins).

                                              PAUSE

There are two doors in the forward cabin, two doors in the mid cabin, two doors aft of the
lavatories and two doors in the rear of the cabin. Please take a moment and determine the closest
exit to you.

                                              PAUSE

All main doors are equipped with an escape slide.

                                              PAUSE

Just prior to touchdown, you will be instructed to ―brace‖.

To brace, sit back as far as you can in your seat.

Ensure your seatbelt is low and tight around your waist.

Bend as far forward as possible and grab your ankles or cross your wrists and place your
forehead on the seatback of the seat in front of you.

                                              PAUSE

You must stay in the brace position until the aircraft comes to a complete stop.

Once the aircraft comes to a complete stop, follow the instructions of the crew members.
Release your seatbelts and move to the nearest available exit.

DO NOT take anything with you.

At the door, jump into the slide feet first in the sitting position.
At the bottom of the slide, quickly move away from the aircraft.
At this time, remove all sharp objects for collection by a crew member.
AFI11-2C-32BV3 26 AUGUST 2011                                                                      153
