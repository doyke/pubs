This instruction implements AFPD 91-1, Nuclear Weapons and Systems Surety. This publication
is consistent with AFPD 13-5, Air Force Nuclear Enterprise. It applies to nuclear logistics
transport by the Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF). Section A assigns responsibilities. Section
B contains the nuclear weapon system safety rules. The safety rules in Section B may only be
changed using procedures in AFI 91-102, Nuclear Weapon System Safety Studies Operational
Safety Review and Safety Rules. See attachment 1 for abbreviations and acronyms used in this
instruction. This Instruction applies to all Air Force personnel, nuclear certified equipment, and
facilities involved with nuclear weapons, nuclear weapon systems, and radioactive materials-
related programs. Personnel involved with nuclear weapons, nuclear weapon systems, and
radioactive materials are responsible for compliance. This Instruction is applicable to the Air
Force Reserve (AFR) and Air National Guard (ANG) units performing nuclear missions. Ensure
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with
the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS). Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the
appropriate functional’s chain of command.             Field activities must send implementing
publications to the higher headquarters functional OPR for review and coordination before
publishing. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are
identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance statement. See
 2                                                                    AFI91-115 19 JUNE 2014

with the Tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the
appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the Publication OPR for non-tiered
compliance items.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It incorporates
multiple format changes for ease of use and currency. Additionally, Aircrew Possession is more
thoroughly defined and Emergency Nuclear Airlift Force (ENAF) has been renamed to
Emergency Nuclear Airlift Operations (ENAO). AFI33-360 guidance to include tier waiver
requirements has also been incorporated.

     restricted area.
24. Disable/Jettison:
     24.1. When applicable, use the Command Disable System (CDS), if available, before crash
     landing or jettisoning a nuclear weapon. (Refer to the US Air Force SWOG for jettison
     restrictions.)
