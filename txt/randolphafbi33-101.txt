applies to the 12th Communications Squadron (12 CS), 12th Mission Support Group Civil
Engineer Division (12 MSG/CE), and 12th Flying Training Wing Safety (12 FTW/SE). Ensure
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

AFPD 33-1, Command, Control, Communication, and Computer (C4) Systems, 17 September
1993 changed to AFPD 33-1, Information Resources Management, 27 June 2006. In addition,
the functional address symbol (FAS) of the OPR is changed from 12 CS/SCBCW, Cable
Systems to 12 CS/SCOIW; 12 CS/SCB, Information Systems Flight to 12 CS/SCO, Information
Systems Flight; and12 CS/SCQ Information Services Flight has changed to 12 CS/SCX.

1. Any project requiring entry into communications manholes performed by 12 CS,
12 MSG/CE, or other personnel requires notification and permission from 12 CS/SCOIW. The
12 CS/SCOIW maintains a log of entry for each communications manhole on Randolph AFB in
the Confined Space Entry Program, as well as a Master Entry Plan, records management, and
manhole upkeep purposes. Any work accomplished in communications manholes must meet all
safety/technical order standards.

2. All personnel requiring entry into communications manholes for engineering; design or
physical installation; or maintenance work on copper, fiber optic, or coaxial-type cables will
process through 12 CS/SCX (building 990/room 148A) and 12 CS/SCOIW (building 379/room
15).

3. Personnel will brief their project objectives and manhole access locations. They must fill out
the appropriate confined space entry log. Additionally, they need to ensure project blueprints
can be converted to the proper microstation format.

4. Compliance with AFOSH 91-25, Confined Spaces, is mandatory anytime a communications
manhole is opened.

5. The 12 CS/SCOIW will ensure the work accomplished in communications manholes meets
all Air Force, AETC, 12 FTW, and Randolph AFB regulations and standards. Additionally,
make sure computer-communications systems installation records (CSIR) are on hand and in the
proper format to allow for accurate record updates on project completion.

6. The 12 CS/SCOIW will be designated as the quality control evaluator for all work
accomplished in communications manholes, and inspect and evaluate all workmanship and
materials involved. Additionally, during project implementation and periodically thereafter,
monitor to ensure quality procedures are being followed.

7. On project completion, communications manholes will be left clean and neat with all cables
properly designated, marked, racked, and supported. CSIR documents will be properly updated
according to AFI 21-404, Developing & Maintaining Communications and Information Systems
Installation Records, while the quality control representative will have evaluated the work. Two
copies of the updated CSIR document will be given to 12 CS/SCX for formal updating and
record purposes.
