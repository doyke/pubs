                                     INTRODUCTION

1. This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to enhance on-the-job
   training for Aerospace Medical Service Specialist, Independent Duty Medical
   Technician (IDMT), 4N0X1C. It provides the trainer with a breakdown of task
   performance skills to aid in performance evaluation.

2. Your role as the trainer is to carefully read over each module and identify the QTPs
   that pertain to the IDMTs in your operational setting. Core tasks are also identified
   with the number five (5) in the Specialty Training Standard (STS). These core tasks
   are thought of as war skills and have been deemed essential for training even during
   times of war. You have the flexibility to train these volumes in the order that best
   suits your needs.

3. When the trainee has been allowed sufficient time for training and is ready for
   evaluation, follow the evaluation instructions and use the performance checklist as a
   guide to evaluate performance. Provide feedback to the trainee after each
   evaluation. Document progress on the AF Form 1098. Initial certification is also
   signed off in the STS. If a trainee does not successfully complete the QTP, provide
   feedback and counsel the trainee on their weak areas. Allow adequate preparation
   time before conducting a retest.

4. The QTPs are a tool for assessing/certifying the IDMT each time they arrive at a new
   duty station and as a tool for standardizing annual refresher training. Our goal has
   been to publish a useable document for both the trainee and trainer. We value your
   first hand expertise and solicit your feedback on how we can improve our product.
