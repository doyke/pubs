SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include delineation of Headquarters Air Force Directorate of Manpower, Personnel and Services
(AF/A1S) functional responsibilities and designation of the Air Force Decorations Board
(AFDB) Director, Secretary of the Air Force Personnel Council (SAFPC), as chair of the AFDB
for reviewing, approving or disapproving most high level civilian award nominations. It
reformats the guidance for approval and processing of incentive, campaign and service awards,
and clarifies that time-off awards are prohibited in conjunction with NSPS Performance Payouts
(DoD 1400.25-M, Sub Chapter 1930.9.6.4). It also adds new awards for non-governmental
employees, new lapel pins for the Senior Executive Air Force and the Headquarters Air Force
Staff, and aligns the levels of approval authority for civilian awards with the approval authority
for the equivalent military decorations.

                                             Chapter 2

                              INCENTIVE AWARDS PROGRAM

2.1. Purpose: This instruction prescribes guidance and procedures governing the Air Force
Incentive Awards Program and delegates authority, assigns responsibility, and establishes
requirements for awards and awards programs for civilian employees within the Air Force. This
instruction also establishes Air Force-level awards for private citizens, groups or organizations.
     2.1.1. The Air Force Incentive Awards Program provides special awards for superior
     accomplishments. Awards under this chapter should not be used to replace or supplement
     performance awards.
2.2. Program Administration:
     2.2.1. Award. Something bestowed or an action taken to recognize and reward an
     individual or team achievement that contributes to meeting organizational goals or improving
     the efficiency, effectiveness and economy of the Government or is otherwise in the public
     interest.
     2.2.2. Goal. The goal of the Air Force Civilian Awards Program is to foster mission
     accomplishment by recognizing excellence in its civilian employees and motivating them to
     high levels of performance and service. The Air Force Civilian Incentive Awards program
     will be administered by HQ USAF, commanders, directors, managers, and supervisors at all
     levels. They will:
        2.2.2.1. Ensure that awards are granted consistent with Equal Employment Opportunity
        (EEO) and affirmative employment program policies and are free from discrimination
        regardless of age, sex, race, color, religion, national origin, marital status, or physical or
        mental disability. Discrimination based on sexual orientation is prohibited as prescribed
        by DODD 1020.02, Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity (EO) in the
        Department of Defense.
        2.2.2.2. Ensure that special efforts are made to ensure under-represented groups are
        included among those given fair consideration for all incentive awards.
        2.2.2.3. Ensure that monetary, time-off, and honorary awards are used as individual or
        group awards. These awards can be granted while on detail or temporary assignment.
        Nominations should be submitted through proper channels within 60 days of act or event.
2.3. Monetary and Honorary Awards. Monetary and honorary awards should be granted
when merited regardless of the employee’s grade, level of responsibility, or type of
responsibility. It is important that awards be granted for job-related contributions only if the
contribution is clearly beyond performance requirements and has not been previously rewarded
in the prior normal performance evaluation cycle nor will the accomplishments be used to
support an upcoming normal performance evaluation award. Non-civilian pay funds must be
transferred to civilian pay accounts to cover monetary awards given for accomplishments outside
of normal performance evaluation recognition (to include Notable Achievement Awards and
Special Act or Service Awards). Honorary awards normally require a minimum of a year of
effort. See specific guidance for each honorary award.
AFI36-1004_NELLISAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2010                                                           9


   2.3.1. Honorary awards may be given to civilian employees at any time in their careers,
   including occasions such as retirement, reassignment, transfer, or separation, provided the
   individual’s accomplishments fully meet the criteria for the particular award.

Table 2.1. Determining Award Eligibility.
                      Is the subject of the contribution within the scope of the employee’s
                      work?
                      Does the employee’s job description or performance plan cover the
                      subject of the contribution?
                      Is the nature of the contribution such that the employee’s
                      performance would be judged less than satisfactory if this
                      contribution had not been made?
                      Is the contribution one pertaining to the immediate work area which
                      the employee can put into operation without consulting higher

                      his or her immediate area?
                      If the answers to the above questions are “No” and the contribution
                      has not and will not be the basis of a past or future annual
                      performance award, the contribution should be considered for
                      monetary or honorary recognition.
                      If the answers to the above questions are “Yes” and the contribution
                      has not and will not be the basis of a past or future annual
                      performance award, the contribution should be considered for
                      monetary or honorary recognition.

2.4. Air Force Incentive Awards Program Support. All levels of command will endorse and
support the Air Force Incentive Awards Program.
   2.4.1. To help ensure this level of support, the following should be in place at all levels:
       2.4.1.1. Appropriate and consistent use of the various types of awards.
 10                                         AFI36-1004_NELLISAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2010


       2.4.1.2. Active interest and participation of all Air Force employees.
       2.4.1.3. Full consideration of eligible Air Force employees for awards sponsored by
       external organizations.
   2.4.2. Incentive awards for performance or achievement will not be made to an individual
   who has been actively and substantially involved in unlawful discrimination.
   2.4.3. No incentive award for performance or achievement award will be made to an
   individual who:
       2.4.3.1. Is either under investigation or upon whom disciplinary or adverse action based
       on performance or conduct is pending.
       2.4.3.2. Was the subject of a disciplinary action during the period of the award.
          2.4.3.2.1. The installation commander or civilian leader may give the award if he or
          she finds that the basis for the award is unrelated to the investigation, pending action,
          or the discipline and the award would not reflect unfavorably on the Air Force.
2.5. Special Command Trophies and Awards. The Air Force encourages installations to
establish unique honorary awards to recognize superior accomplishments. Likewise, the
establishment of local quarterly or annual awards programs is encouraged. In such events, these
programs should conform to guidance cited in paragraph 2.15 of this Air Force Instruction.
   2.5.1. Installations will notify AFPC/DPI before presenting a special command trophy or
   award to a nationally prominent person serving as an expert or consultant. The notification
   will include the name of the person, a copy of the awards committee minutes, and other
   supporting data. Send to AFPC/DPI at least 60 calendar days before the presentation
   ceremony.
   2.5.2. Installations may present non-monetary awards and define such items as a medal,
   certificate, plaque, citation, badge, or other similar items that have an award or honor
   connotation. Installations may give items with the command or organization logo, such as
   belt buckles and jackets, but such items must be valued at less than $60.
2.6. Federal and Non-Federal Awards. Refer to AFI 36-2805, Special Trophies and Awards
for a complete listing of federal and non-federal awards, and the criteria and nomination
procedures for these awards.
2.7. Other Recognition Programs.
   2.7.1. Air Force employees may receive monetary and honorary incentive awards from other
   Federal departments and agencies for contributions only when the accomplishments are very
   significant and beyond those covered during evaluations in normal appraisal cycle
   performance evaluations. The Air Force may grant monetary and honorary incentive awards
   to employees of other Federal departments and agencies when their contributions benefit the
   Air Force.
   2.7.2. Occasionally, a manager outside an employee’s chain of command may wish to
   nominate an employee for an award. Examples are as follows:
       2.7.2.1. When an employee has been assigned to a long-term detail outside his or her
       organization.
AFI36-1004_NELLISAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2010                                                         11


       2.7.2.2. When an employee has completed a special project or has given extraordinary
       service benefiting a serviced organization.
   2.7.3. On these occasions, the nomination must be coordinated with the employee’s actual
   Service and/or chain of command before it is submitted.
   2.7.4. The unit sponsoring a monetary incentive award to employees of other Federal
   departments or agencies must provide funding from their own civilian pay resources to cover
   the costs. Consider an honorary award if the cost of transferring funds for a monetary award
   exceeds the value of the award.
2.8. Eligibility.
   2.8.1. Civilian Employees. Civilian employees who meet the definition of “employee”
   under 5 United States Code (U.S.C) 2105 are eligible to receive awards under this
   subchapter. Performance Awards may be paid to SES employees under 5 CFR 534.403, but
   not on the basis of this Instruction. Private citizens and organizations may be recognized for
   significant contributions to the Air Force with non-monetary awards only.
   2.8.2. Former Employees. Under 5 CFR 451.104, awards for contributions made by an
   individual when employed by Department of Defense may be paid to a former employee or
   to the estate or legal heirs of a deceased employee.
   2.8.3. Non-Appropriated Fund Employees. Employees paid with non-appropriated funds
   are not eligible to receive monetary awards paid from appropriated funds but may receive
   non-monetary awards under this Instruction.

       receive awards under this Instruction.
       2.8.4.2. An FNE who is paid on a cost reimbursable basis by agreement with a foreign
       country, (i.e., indirect hire employee), is not eligible to receive monetary awards, but may
       receive non-monetary awards under this Instruction.
   2.8.5. Contractors.
       2.8.5.1. DoD 1400.25-M, Subsection 451, prohibits awards to individuals or entities in a
       profit making or commercial relationship with the DoD. Awards may not be created to
       recognize contractor efforts and contractors are ineligible to participate in Air Force
       awards program created for Air Force civilian personnel. (Note: Contractor
       contributions may be acknowledged ONLY if the contribution is “substantially” beyond
       the terms of the contract or is in the public interest).
       2.8.5.2. Individuals or entities in a profit making or commercial relationship with the Air
       Force may be awarded an AF Form 3033, Certificate of Appreciation and/or a Letter of
       Appreciation only.
2.9. Presenting and Publicizing Awards. The installation commander, civilian leader,
director, management official, or supervisor recognizes employees and presents awards at a
suitable ceremony. When an Air Force employee receives recognition outside the Air Force,

significant civilian achievements and/or contributions are recognized and publicized in the
installation media as well as the local community.
2.10. Certificates in Braille. All Air Force award certificates for blind or visually impaired
award recipients must have Braille overlaid lettering as well as standard print. Use local
purchase authority to obtain these certificates.
2.11. Foreign Decorations. AFI 51-901, Gifts from Foreign Governments, provides for
employees of the U.S. Government, including members of the U.S. Armed Forces, to accept gifts
or decorations from a foreign government under certain conditions. No DoD employee,
however, may request or otherwise encourage the offer of a decoration from a foreign
government.    Refer to DoD Directive 1005.13, Gifts and Decorations from Foreign
Governments, for the policies and procedures applicable to the acceptance of gifts from foreign

   recognize long-term service that may include one or more honorary awards.
2.15. Installation Incentive Awards Committee.
   2.15.1. Commanders of Field Operating Agencies (FOAs) may use existing installation
   incentive awards committee. The CPF/CPE gives program support and guidance. The
   committee:
       2.15.1.1. Reviews, computes, and recommends to the installation commander approval
       or disapproval of cash award amounts that require committee action or higher level
       approval.

                             MONETARY INCENTIVE AWARDS

3.1. General Information. The Air Force considers approved monetary awards to be valid
obligations of the government that must be paid, subject only to availability of funds and meeting
legal regulatory requirements. Each activity should budget a percentage of its yearly civilian pay
budget for funding awards. The nominating organization pays the award costs and provides the
funding information to the employee’s organization. If the administrative cost of transferring
funds would exceed the amount of the award, the employing agency will absorb the award cost
and pay the award. Monetary incentive awards do not substitute for personnel actions, pay, or
performance awards. Unit resource advisors/managers must validate that funds are available
from a specified non-civilian pay account to reimburse the civilian pay account for any awards
paid outside of the normal annual performance evaluation.
3.2. Special Act or Service Award (SASA). The SASA is a monetary form of recognition
granted for a contribution or accomplishment in the public interest that is a non-recurring
contribution either in or outside of job responsibilities, a scientific achievement or in recognition
of a courageous handling of an emergency situation.
   3.2.1. The act, service, or achievement must result in either tangible savings to the
   government (i.e., measured in terms of dollars) or intangible savings to the government (i.e.,
   cannot be measured in terms of dollars) or both.
   3.2.2. SASA recognizes contributions for a non-recurring special achievement that is not
   otherwise rewarded by a normal annual performance evaluation cycle award.
   3.2.3. SES employees are not eligible for SASA awards.
   3.2.4. The act or service to be recognized must not have served in whole or in part as the
   basis for a previous cash award.
   3.2.5. The amount awarded for a SASA may range from $501 to $25,000 depending on the
   achievement being recognized. The amount awarded for a SASA should be based upon the
   tangible and intangible benefits to the government. Cash award criteria is outlined in tables
   3.1 and 3.2.
3.3. Process. An employee’s supervisor or any individual having direct knowledge of the act,
service, scientific or other achievement; in coordination with the employee’s supervisor; may
initiate an award nomination. The nomination should be submitted within 60 calendar days of
the act, service or achievement being recognized. Reference Chapter 2, paragraph 2.3 and 2.18.
Use AF Form 2860, Special Act or Service Award, for award recognition. This form is available
through AF E-Publishing (http://www.e-publishing.af.mil).
   3.3.1. An SASA must be funded by the unit making the nomination from their non-civilian
   pay accounts to reimburse the civilian pay account. Units must identify the fund cite in the
   body of the SSS.
   3.3.2. Recommendations for SASA from $501 to $10,000 must contain the specific non-
   civilian pay fund cites that will be used to reimburse civilian pay accounts and Resource
   Advisors must certify that funds are available from that source.

   3.4. Award Approval.
          3.4.1. An SASA from $501 to $10,000 may be approved by:
                3.4.1.1. Installation: Installation commander (CC) or civilian leader (CL) equivalent.
                3.4.1.2. FOA/DRU: CC or CV (or CL equivalent)
                3.4.1.3. MAJCOM: Director.
                3.4.1.4. Air Staff: AF/CVA or designee.
                3.4.1.5. Secretary of the Air Force: SAF/AA or designee.
          3.4.2. A SASA over $10,000, not to exceed $25,000, must be staffed through command
          channels to SAF/AA for forwarding to the Office of Personnel Management for approval.
          3.4.3. Presidential approval is required for all awards over $25,000.
   3.5. Notable Achievement Award (NAA). A NAA recognizes a notable achievement meriting
   quick recognition and is a lesser award than a Special Act or Service Award.
          3.5.1. SES employees are not eligible for the NAA.
          3.5.2. The NAA may not be granted to an individual who has received a previous monetary
          award for the same contribution.
          3.5.3. The amount awarded may range from $50 to $500 and may be approved by the

                             TIME-OFF INCENTIVE AWARDS

4.1. Granting Time-Off Awards. The Time-Off Award (TOA) is only authorized to recognize
superior accomplishments of an employee that contributed to the quality, efficiency, or economy
of government operations. These awards provide an alternative to monetary or non-monetary
recognition for superior accomplishments. The TOA grants time off from duty without loss of
pay or charge to leave. With the exception of an NSPS Performance Payout, a TOA can be
granted for performance as reflected in the employee’s most recent rating of record and can be
granted in lieu of, or in conjunction with, a performance award (see 4.1.4, reference NSPS
performance payout for employees). Decisions to grant TOAs shall be based upon the same
criteria or circumstances as for other incentive awards (i.e., Special Act or Service Awards). The
period of time-off granted is based upon the value of the individual’s contribution, not upon the
individual’s grade or salary.
   4.1.1. Immediate supervisors may approve a TOA up to one working day without review and
   approval of a higher official. An award in excess of one day must be approved by the
   employee’s second-level supervisor.
   4.1.2. Civilian employees forfeiting a TOA due to activation for Guard or Reserve duty are
   entitled to reinstatement of their award. A reinstated TOA must be used within 6 months of
   deactivation from active service.
   4.1.3. A TOA shall not be granted to create the effect of a holiday or treated as
   administrative excusals or leave. They shall not be granted in conjunction with a military
   “down,” “goal,” “family,” “training” day, or the like which would grant a TOA to the entire
   civilian employee population or a majority of the civilian population.
   4.1.4. A TOA cannot be used in lieu of or as a supplement to an NSPS performance payout
   to an employee. A TOA or other incentive award may, however, be considered during the
   performance cycle to recognize the employee for a specific accomplishment or act, Special
   care must be taken to ensure the employee is not rewarded twice for the same performance.
   For example: an NSPS employee’s performance appraisal cannot be used as supporting
   documentation to justify a TOA in conjunction with the annual appraisal.
4.2. Eligibility. Employees, including SES and direct-hire FNEs, meeting the definition of 5
U.S.C. 2105 are eligible to receive a TOA. Indirect-hire FNEs are eligible for these awards only
if an incentive awards program established by agreement with the host country includes such a
provision.
   4.2.1. Civilian Team Incentive Award. A TOA may be granted to those employees whose
   individual contributions to a team effort caused the team to achieve superior
   accomplishments. It should be recognized that some members of a team might not have
   contributed substantially to the team’s overall success. As such, a TOA may only be offered
   to employees who contributed to the overall team accomplishment. Where recognition is
   based on the achievement of pre-established goals, measures, or other award formula, the
   goal, measure or formula justifying recognition must itself clearly represent superior
   accomplishments. To grant time-off in this manner, the performance outcomes must be so
 20                                         AFI36-1004_NELLISAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2010


   significant that this type of award is clearly warranted and a benefit to the Air Force. See
   paragraph 4.1 for the basic requirements for granting the TOA and paragraphs 4.3.1, 4.3.7,
   and 4.3.8, for additional restrictions relevant to the use of team incentive awards.
4.3. Time-Off Award Limits.
   4.3.1. The maximum amount of time-off that may be approved for any single contribution is
   40 hours. Employees working a typical 80-hour pay period may be awarded a total time-off
   of 80 hours during any leave year.
   4.3.2. For part-time employees or those with an uncommon tour of duty, the total time off
   granted during any calendar year must be based on the average number of hours generally
   worked during a two-week period. The maximum award for any single contribution is one-
   half the maximum amount of time that can be granted during the year. The term, uncommon
   tour of duty is defined as an established tour of duty that exceeds 80 hours of work in a
   biweekly pay period (including standby duty). For example, the regular tour of duty
   established for firefighters is recognized as an uncommon tour of duty per 5 CFR 630.201.
   4.3.3. Awarded time-off should be scheduled within 90 calendar days after the effective date
   of the award. Employees forfeit any time-off not used within one year from the effective
   date.
   4.3.4. TOAs must be carefully scheduled to avoid adversely affecting an employee who has
   an annual leave "use or lose" situation.
   4.3.5. Awarded time-off cannot be used to justify restoring forfeited annual leave.
   4.3.6. Employees may never convert a TOA to a cash payment.
   4.3.7. Employees may not transfer approved, unused time-off when they transfer from the
   Air Force to another DoD component or to another Federal agency. In addition, employees
   coming from another department or Federal agency may not transfer a TOA to the Air Force.
   4.3.8. Consistent with Paragraph 4.1 and 4.2.1, a TOA will not be granted broadly across
   organizational (flight, squadron, group, etc.) lines or on an installation-wide basis.
   Furthermore, TOAs will not be granted to create the effect or appearance of a holiday or
   treated as administrative excusals, base closure days, or leave, e.g., they shall not be granted
   in conjunction with a military “down” or “training” day or similar duty excusals which would
   grant the entire or majority of the civilian employee population a TOA to be used on a
   specified day.
   4.3.9. Once awarded, an employee cannot be required to use their TOA on a date specified
   by a supervisor or higher official.
4.4. Documenting Time-Off. Support any TOA that has appropriate written justification.
Submit the approved TOA to the CPF/CPE for processing. Include the employee's name, social
security number, organization, and number of hours of time-off granted.
   4.4.1. Justify time-off by explaining how the employee merits the award. Reference
   paragraph 2.18 for nomination process. Include the following certification statement from
   the supervisor or recommending official: "I have considered fully the wage costs and
   productivity loss in granting this time-off award. The amount of time-off granted is
   commensurate with the individual’s contribution or accomplishment. I also considered the
AFI36-1004_NELLISAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2010                                                         21


   unit's workload and unit employees’ leave projections and certify that the employee can
   schedule the time-off in addition to other scheduled leave. I also considered other available
   forms of recognition in determining the amount of this time-off award."
   4.4.2. Include the approving official's name, position title, signature and date signed, as well
   as those of the recommending official, as appropriate.
   4.4.3. Standard Form 50 (SF-50), Notification of Personnel Action, must be used to
   document the approved TOA and will be filed in the employee's Official Personnel Folder
   (OPF). File award justification in the employee performance file (EPF) maintained by the
   supervisor. Prepare a separate SF-50 for each approved award.
   4.4.4. Document the effective date of the award on the SF-50 after appropriate review and
   verification of legal requirements by an approving official.
4.5. Recording Scheduled Time-Off.
   4.5.1. Record the employee's use of time-off on the employee's time and attendance reports
   according to instructions published by the civilian payroll function.
   4.5.2. The employee must obtain their supervisor’s approval to schedule and use the TOA.
   Employee should request their time-off far enough in advance to use it without disrupting the
   unit's work.
   4.5.3. Supervisors must contact the employee’s servicing CPF/CPE to verify all regulatory
   requirements were satisfied prior to receiving the employee’s SF-50.

     consecutive days; 2) For the full period, if the operation is less than 30 days; 3) For 60

     military operations, and includes service in the countries of Afghanistan and Iraq:
     foreign territory on which military troops have actually landed or are present and
     specifically deployed for operations; adjacent water areas in which ships are operating,
     patrolling, or providing direct support of the operation; and the air space above and
     adjacent to the area in which operations are being conducted. The Chairman, Joint Chiefs
     of Staff, will determine the US military operations that qualify for the GWOT-E.
     Military Personnel Flights can provide a current list of military operations for which the
     GWOT-E is authorized.
  6.3.3. Limitations on Awarding the Medal. The medal may be awarded only to DoD

      6.3.3.3. The GWOT-C may be awarded only once to a civilian employee for service to a
      GWOT military operation. An employee may not be awarded both the GWOT-C and the
      Armed Forces Civilian Service Medal for the same operation. A contribution to or
      support of a GWOT military operation by employees assigned to remotely located
      activities, (e.g., outside the areas of eligibility), is not justification for award of the
      GWOT-C. Such performance or contribution, if merited, may be acknowledged by other
      appropriate recognition.
   6.3.4. Posthumous Award. The GWOT-C may be awarded and may be presented to a

   6.3.6. Monetary Amount. None.
   6.3.7. Award Description. The statue of freedom represents the ultimate goal of operations
   in support of the GWOT. The laurel branches symbolize honor and achievement. The five
   stars allude to the military service, and the triangle, which is the traditional symbol of civilian
   service, denotes support. The spears enclose and defend “Freedom” and allude to support for
   military service. The ribbon, medium blue is the color associated with the DoD. Gold
   represents excellence and achievement. Black and red symbolize the threat and danger of
   terrorism. Red, White and Blue, our National colors, are for patriotism and the love of
   freedom. The medal set includes a medal and lapel pin which is available through the
   Defense Supply System (Stock NSN # 8455-01-545-7149). There is no official DoD
   certificate to accompany the medal. An illustration of the medal is provided at Figure 6.2.

   symbolizes the importance that DoD places on the service of its civilian work force to
   military operations and the value of its contribution in accomplishing the Nation’s objectives.
   6.4.2. Eligibility.
      6.4.2.1. General. The Deputy Secretary of Defense approved the establishment of the

          activities of the Armed Forces in a military operation awarded the AFSM, but only if
          the employee actually enters the designated area of eligibility.
      6.4.2.3. The areas of eligibility are the same as those designated for approved AFSM
      military operations, i.e., the foreign territory on which military troops have actually
      landed or are present and specifically deployed for the operation; adjacent water areas in
      which ships are operating, patrolling, or providing direct support of the operation; and the
      air space above and adjacent to the area in which operations are being conducted. The
      Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, will determine the US military operations that qualify for
      the AFSM. Military Personnel Flights can provide a current list of military operations for
      which the AFSM is authorized.
   6.4.3. Limitations on Awarding the Medal. The medal may be awarded only to DoD
   civilian employees and only for operations authorized the AFSM for military personnel. No

  assigned to remotely located activities, (e.g., outside the areas of eligibility), is not
  justification for award of the AFCSM. Such performance or contribution, if merited, may be
  acknowledged by other appropriate recognition. Award of the AFCSM does not preclude
  granting other awards if the employee’s contribution to the designated operation is as
  significant or extraordinary as to merit additional recognition.
  6.4.4. Posthumous Award. The AFCSM may be awarded and may be presented to a
