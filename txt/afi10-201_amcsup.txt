official for assignment of the overall C-Level and signature for release prior to meeting with the
SRO at the appointed time.
2.4. Frequency of Reporting C-level Data Elements. The unit commander is responsible for
meeting the reporting timelines. Reports must also be sent, updating the GSORTS database
within 24 hours, when the 3/6/12-month forecast changes, data expires, to include get well/worse
date (GWD) or upon direction from AMC/A3OCR. Reports must not be held up in order to
submit within the monthly AMC reporting window or until a scheduled brief to wing/group
commanders is conducted.
2.4.1. (Added) Measured units will submit monthly SORTS reports updating all required unit
data beginning on the 20th at 0001Z, with all reports updated in the GSORTS database not later
than 25th at 2359Z of each month. SRO must request a waiver from the A3OCR prior to 2359Z
if they cannot submit reports within the established timeline.
2.5.1.1. (Added) When unit commanders are unable to obtain a Forecast Date of Change
(CADAT) or determine a GWD, they will ensure the responsible AMC FAMs is contacted for
assistance. NOTE: To Be Determined (TBD) and Unknown (UNK) are not to be used as
substitutes for GWD.
2.5.2. The 3, 6 and 12-month forecasted C-level is based on the month of the GWD, not the day.
For example, if a unit is C-3 on 15 Feb and forecasting to improve to C-2 on 27 May, the 3-
month forecast will show a C-2. Commander’s Assessments will not be used in the Forecast
Change Rating (CARAT) or in the CADAT Remark. The CARAT and the 3, 6 and 12-month
forecast levels need to reflect what the unit’s actual overall C-Level will be, given the current
measured area levels and their corresponding GWDs. Forecasts must be based on concrete
indications of an impending change in the unit’s C-level such as actual arrival and departure
dates of personnel, or actual dates when equipment items are scheduled for maintenance. An
explanation addressing expected shortfalls must accompany the 3, 6 and 12-month forecasts.
2.5.2.3. (Added) When a unit is an overall C-1 and is forecasting less than a C-1 in any of the
3/6/12 month forecast, a corresponding remark is required to be submitted using the appropriate
Primary Reason Measured Resource Area Level For Personnel Not C-1 (PRRES), Primary
Reason Equipment and Supplies On Hand Not C-1 (ESRES), Primary Reason Equipment
Condition Category Level Not C-1 (ERRES), or Primary Reason Training Resource Area Not C-
1 (TRRES) label.
2.11. Remarks will be used to explain deficiencies and corrective actions. Generic entries are
not authorized. Remarks will be directly related to deficiencies in the UTCs and mission
narrative listed in the unit’s DOC Statement. The overall purpose of remarks is to highlight
DOC Statement capability deficiencies as well as explicit description of what portions of the
DOC Statement mission, which the unit can accomplish, to include a narrative and extent of the
missions able to be accomplished. Remarks considered by the SRO, Command Reporting
Organization (CRO), or FAM as inadequate, ambiguous, or not in compliance with AFI 10-201
and AMC guidance will be corrected by the reporting unit and resubmitted into the GSORTS
database within 24 hours of notification.
2.11.1. Remarks may be used at any time to provide supplemental information. Do not refer to
previous messages or remarks under other labels. Each remark must include GWD for each next
projected C-level until reaching C-1. Measured area remarks must include GWD for each next
AFI10-201_AMCSUP 2 JUNE 2011                                                                    13


projected measured area level until reaching level 1 (i.e. P-1, S-1, R-1 or T-1). All GWD must
be in the “DDMMMYY” format. All acronyms must be spelled out when they are first used
within each remark. Abbreviations must not be used at anytime throughout the SORTS reports.
AFSC listings must contain the job title of each AFSC. Remarks considered inadequate or
ambiguous will be corrected by the reporting unit and resubmitted into the database within 24
hours.
2.11.1.1. (Added) Each remark must meet the appropriate requirements outlined within SORTS
guidance. While each measured area remark is designed to provide precise information on unit
deficiencies and actions taken/to be taken to remedy the situation, the reason remark is designed
to role up all the remarks giving a full unit readiness picture. Each measured area is to be rolled
up into the reason remark to give a full picture of unit’s ability to conduct DOC Statement
missions and man DOC Statement UTCs. Reason remarks, which are a verbatim copy of
measured area remarks do not serve to provide an appropriate overview of unit readiness and
capability, rather usually provide an incomplete picture of the unit’s overall readiness.
2.11.1.2. (Added) If the content within the remark does not change, update the date of the
remark to prevent it from exceeding 30 days from the last revision.
2.11.6.1. (Added) Before addressing an outside organization in remarks, be sure to coordinate
the specific remark with that organization to ensure accuracy and currency of the remark. For
example, before submitting a remark stating you are waiting for supplies on order or waiting for
delivery of a vehicle from transportation, check with the Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) for
current status.
2.11.8.2.3. (Added) Report AMC aircraft UTCs deployed within the continental United States
(CONUS) for 3 days or less report using remarks. UTCs deployed for more than 3 days, or out of
the CONUS for training or evaluations, report via the major equipment location (MEQLOCN)
data set.
2.11.8.3.1. (Added) LRS does maintain all mobility bags so all AMC units will use this blanket
statement in the RIDCA remark: “MOBILITY BAGS ARE CENTRALLY LOCATED AT XXX
LRS. BAGS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED UPON RECEIPT OF INDIVIDUAL TASKING”. The
units still must include the Mobility Bag statement already part of the RICDA remark.
Example:       (Date) MOBILITY BAGS
               TYPE        AUTH/REQ                  ONHAND
               A-BAG

               MOBILITY BAGS ARE CENTRALLY LOCATED AT XXX LRS. BAGS
               WILL BE DISTRIBUTED UPON RECEIPT OF INDIVIDUAL TASKING


2.11.8.4. (Added) For equipment and crew status data (MEQLOCN) set, explain the following:
2.11.8.4.1. (Added) Give supplemental information on unit's deployed assets (i.e., reason for
deployment and inclusive dates of deployment). Use the TEGEO remark label.
2.11.8.4.2. (Added) Account for aircrews assigned, but not formed by a unit. Use the CREAL
remark label.
 14                                                       AFI10-201_AMCSUP 2 JUNE 2011


2.11.8.4.3. (Added) Account for aircraft possessed but not operationally ready. Use the
MEORD, MEORN, MEORC, or MEORO label.
2.11.8.4.4. (Added) Account for aircrews formed, but not mission ready. Use the CRMRD,
CRMRN, CRMRC, or CRMRO label.
2.11.11.2. If in the commander's judgment, the measured area category levels do not present an
accurate portrayal of a unit's readiness, include plain language supplemental remarks to outline
discrepancies. Using the "REASN" remark label, include the commander's reason(s), in detail,
for subjectively changing the overall Clevel. Include justification for estimated GWD(s).
3.1.1.2. Personnel percentages will not exceed 100%. All personnel overages will be identified
in the TPASG.
3.1.1.4. Identify total and critical civilian personnel shortages in a remark using "PRRES"
labels. List each critical AFSC containing a shortage between requirements and available
personnel by UTC (if applicable), number UMD authorized (AUTH), assigned (ASGN), and
available (AVAIL) in column heading format by AFSC.
4.7. Equipment and Supplies O/H S-Level Calculations. EQSEE and EQSSE percentages will
not exceed 100 percent. Report overages under appropriate remarks label.
4.7.4. For units that measure only equipment and supplies on-hand (equipment condition not
measured), the equipment must also be operationally ready equipment to be on hand. Use the
rules referenced in AFI 10-201, paragraph 5.7 for mission ready and available.
4.9. Aircraft Sustainability Model (ASM) and Weapon System Management Information
System Sustainability Assessment Module (WSMIS-SAM). AMC units will use DMAS, not
WSMIS-SAM.
5.3.3.1.2. EQREE and EQRED percentages will not exceed 100 percent. Report overages under
the appropriate remarks label.
6.2.2.5. Units having more crews assigned (TCRAS) than authorized (TCARQ), report TCRAS
equal to TCARQ and report actual number assigned in remarks using the TCARQ remark label.
6.2.2.5.3. Forms Prescribed: AMC Form 1100A, Status of Resources and Training System

AMC DESIGNED OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY (DOC) STATEMENT PROCEDURES
                     AND RESPONSIBILITIES

A8.1. (Added) Procedures and Responsibilities. AMC/A3OCR is the single POC responsible
for the overall DOC statement program and coordination process for functional area managers.
A8.1.1. (Added) During coordination with the CRO, FAMs must ensure SORTS DOC
statements are written to summarize the mission for which a unit is organized, designed, or
equipped.
A8.1.2. (Added) MAJCOM staff, FAMs, and the measured unit commander must review
SORTS DOC statements annually. The annual review date is the effective date of the DOC
statement (e.g. if DOC is effective 01 Dec 2009, then the annual review is due no later than 01
Dec 2010).
A8.2. (Added) Procedures. DOC statement approval authority is delegated to the MAJCOM
level per AFI 10-201. Approval authority for all active duty AMC units, following staff
coordination, is the designated functional area 2-digit for the measured unit. A3OCR handles the
distribution of DOC statements to the subordinate reporting organizations (SROs) that manage
the DOC statements at the wing level.
A8.2.1. (Added) HQ AMC/A3OCR will:
A8.2.1.1. (Added) Assist in the preparation and coordination process of SORTS DOC
statements.
A8.2.1.2. (Added) Track SORTS DOC statement annual review dates and notify FAMs when
annual reviews are due.
A8.2.1.3. (Added) Review DOC statements prior to publication for required information and
take appropriate action to correct deficiencies.
A8.2.1.4. (Added) Maintain current original SORTS DOC statements and distribute to the
SRO, FAM, HQ USAF/A3OR, wing commanders, and other appropriate agencies.
A8.2.1.5. (Added) Will ensure all DOC Statements are in compliance with AFI 10-201 and the
AMC Supplement, and ensure all recommendations are concur/non-concurred, if required. Prior
to 2 digit signature, all DOC Statements will be sent to the A3OCR staff for final approval.
A8.2.2. (Added) HQ AMC FAMs will:
A8.2.2.1. (Added) Review DOC statements for all active duty units annually according to the
DOC statement effective date.
A8.2.2.2. (Added) Develop Unit Type Codes (UTCs) in conjunction with A3OCR, A4RX,
A1XRR, and the MEFPAK Responsible Agency (MRA) FAM.
A8.2.2.3. (Added) Request new DOCIDs through HQ AMC/A3OCR.                 Draft memorandum
IAW format provided in AFI 10-201, Figure A2.9.
A8.2.2.4. (Added) Develop DOC statements for new units.
A8.2.2.5. (Added) Update DOC statements IAW AFI 10-201, A2.8.

A8.2.2.6. (Added) Write all DOC statements in ICS Viewer (IMT) format.
A8.2.2.7. (Added) Ensure SORTS DOC statements accurately reflect the unit wartime
mission(s), both in garrison and deployable requirements.
A8.2.2.8. (Added) Resolve mismatches between the reference to a unit within operational
plans/orders and UTCs listed on the units SORTS DOC statement.
A8.2.2.9. (Added) Coordinate changes to active duty and Air Reserve Component (ARC) Unit
Manning Documents (UMDs) with A1M.
A8.2.2.10. (Added) Coordinate on all AMC gained unit DOC statements.
A8.2.2.11. (Added) Initiate and complete the DOC statement coordination process from start to
approval by the respective 2-digit. FAMs will allow all agencies at least two weeks to coordinate
on proposed DOC statements.
A8.2.2.12. (Added) Ensure the effective date of the DOC statement is later than, the date of 2-
digit approval. Effective date will provide at least two weeks for wing level coordination. Before
adding the effective date, A3OCR will be notified.
A8.3. (Added) Process for new DOC statements. Coordination with comments, non-
concurrence, or negative replies must be annotated separately and attached with the E-SSS.
A8.3.1. (Added) Active duty DOC statement FAM’s will ensure administrative details are
correct prior to submitting DOC statements for coordination, i.e. Unit Identifier Code (UIC),
Primary Assigned Aircraft (PAA), Mission Design Series (MDS), organizations identified, and
operations plans. Only Air Force standard Type Unit Characteristics (TUCHA) registered UTCs
will be used on DOC statements. Additionally, FAMs will ensure the mission tasking narrative
matches the capability being sourced. FAMs will ensure the process detailed in the attachment is
followed for all new, reviewed, or changed DOC statements. If any coordinator non-concurs, the
DOC statement coordination process is stopped until the FAM meets with all affected offices to
resolve the reason for non-concurrence. The DOC statement is then returned to the coordination
office of non-concurrence for concurrence. If the FAM and the coordination office disagree that
a correction is warranted, the disagreement will be elevated to higher echelons (Air Staff
Functional Manager) for resolution. Once DOC coordination is complete, the DOC statement is
sent to the FAMs 2-digit within the functional area for approval (active duty only). The DOC
statement is returned to the FAM when it is approved. The FAM will provide the original signed
DOC statements to A3OCR for records maintenance and submits scanned or electronic copies
with signature block and date of 2-digit signature for distribution (accomplished by A3OCR) to
the units.
A8.3.2. (Added) Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) DOC
statements are coordinated in accordance with Attachment 1 by the appropriate AMC FAM. HQ
AMC has 45 days to return coordinated DOCs to the ANG or AFRC. No response from AMC
after 45 days indicates concurrence; however, A3OCR requires negative replies two weeks prior
to 45 day suspense. The FAM submits changes to the ANG or AFRC to standardize DOCs with
active duty forces through A3OCR. FAMs have the authority to non-concur with proposed ANG
and AFRC DOC statements sent to AMC for coordination. The ANG and AFRC are approval
authority for ARC DOC statements per AFI 10-201 and can release DOC statements even if
AMC non-concurs. For DOC statement conflicts, coordination with the 2-digit directorate ARC
AFI10-201_AMCSUP 2 JUNE 2011                                                                  19


advisor (if applicable) can facilitate issue resolution. FAMs provide concurrence or reasons for
non-concurrence to A3OCR for transmittal to the ANG and AFRC.
A8.4. (Added) Process to Review DOC statements. FAMs, when tasked, are responsible for
reviewing active duty, ANG, and AFRC DOC statements in accordance with the annual review
process identified in AFI 10-201 Attachment 1, paragraph 1.1.2, and providing HQ
AMC/A3OCR with an electronic MFR stating unit identification of all reviews completed. The
MFR will be signed by the DOC Statement approving authority.
A8.4.1. (Added) For active duty DOC statements, FAMs will review administrative details and
ensure all details are correct prior to submitting DOC statements for coordination. The review
should be conducted by ensuring the steps completed in the attachment are still accurate.
A8.4.2. (Added) The appropriate AMC functional area manager reviews ANG and AFRC DOC
statements. Submit changes to the ANG or AFRC as necessary to standardize them with active
duty forces through HQ AMC/A3OCR.
A8.5. (Added) Process to Change DOC statements. FAMs are responsible for ensuring
changes are made to DOC statements to keep them accurate and current. All applicable steps in
attachment 9 should be followed.
A8.5.1. (Added) For active duty DOC statements, FAMs will ensure changes are correctly
annotated prior to submitting DOC statements for coordination.
A8.5.2. (Added) If the FAM identifies necessary changes to an ANG or AFRC DOC statement,
they will submit the change(s) to the ANG or AFRC through HQ AMC/A3OCR.
A8.6. (Added) Process for Manpower Coordination of DOC statements. The FAM
coordinates with AMC/A1RR in accordance with the DOC statement review process.
A8.6.1. (Added) OPLAN requirements should be a primary consideration for DOC statement
review.
A8.6.2. (Added) A1RR compares the UTCs in the DOC with the Unit Identification Code
(UIC) in the UMD of the tasked unit and advises the FAM if there is sufficient manpower in the
UMD to support the UTCs. Grade/skill level substitution criteria stated in the UTC Mission
Capability statement (MISCAP) will be used if there is not an exact match between the AFSC in
the UTC and UMD, otherwise, adhere to guidance specified within AFI 10-403, para 5.3.3.
A8.6.3. (Added) All units should have sufficient manpower to cover both in-place and
deployment taskings before the DOC is coordinated.
A8.6.3.1. (Added) FAMs should consider major UMD adjustments occurring before the next
annual review. If there are changes, FAMs should follow procedures for DOC statement
adjustments as in AFI 10-201, para. 1.7.9.
A8.6.4. (Added) Air Reserve Component (ARC) resources are maintained in their UMDs in the
Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES). The UTCs are maintained in
Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segment (DCAPES). MPES and DCAPES
are separate systems and do not interface, for that reason updates are accomplished individually.
Therefore, since the UICs are not realigned at the same time as UTCs are added, updated, etc.,
the UIC/UTC comparison may not reflect the true assessment of UTC supportability for ARC

DOCs. FAMs should work closely with A1MX to ensure that all ARC units are capable of
supporting their DOCs.
A8.6.4.1. (Added) After determining the ARC requirement, the FAM confirms that A1RR can
validate this requirement by reviewing OPLANs and ensuring all active resources are utilized
before tasking an ARC unit. A1RR will verify requirements and determine availability of
resources. The AMC FAM interacts with the ARC FAM keeping them informed of what UTCs
are assigned to what units. This relationship is mutual, because the ARC FAMs write the DOCs
for the ARC units and the AMC FAM coordinates after ensuring that A1RR reviews and
validates the requirement. When the ARC manpower is placed on the AMC UMD by A1RR, the
AMC FAM reviews the UMD ensuring proper changes have been made. This completes the
process.
A8.6.4.2. (Added) If there are still shortfalls after all possible substitutions and UICs are used,
A1RR will notify the FAM. Shortfalls are handled on a case-by-case basis.
A8.7. (Added) AMC Readiness and Reports. HQ AMC/A3OCR will maintain a current
signed copy of all active duty DOC statements and the capability to access ANG and AFRC
DOC statements. A3OCR will transmit active duty DOC statements to Headquarters Air Force
and 18 AF/CC upon request. SROs will access active duty doc statement via the following
