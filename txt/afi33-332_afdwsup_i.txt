                                               Chapter 1

                     OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT PROGRAM

1.1. Basic Guidelines. This instruction implements the Privacy Act of 1974 and applies to
records on living US citizens and permanent resident aliens that are retrieved by name or
personal identifier. This instruction also provides guidance on collecting and disseminating
personal information in general.
    1.1.1. Records that are retrieved by name or personal identifier are subject to Privacy
    Act (PA) requirements and are referred to as PA systems of records. The Air Force must
    publish notices in the Federal Register, describing the collection of information for new,
    changed or deleted systems to inform the public and give them an opportunity to comment
    before implementing or changing the system. (see Attachment 2).
    1.1.2. An official system of records is:
       1.1.2.1. Authorized by law or Executive Order.
       1.1.2.2. Needed to carry out an Air Force mission or function.
       1.1.2.3. Published in the Federal Register.
    1.1.3. The Air Force will not:
       1.1.3.1. Keep records on how a person exercises First Amendment rights.
       EXCEPTIONS are when: The Air Force has the permission of that individual or is
       authorized by Federal statute; or the information pertains to and is within the scope of, an
       authorized law enforcement activity. First Amendment rights include, but are not limited
       to, freedom of religion, freedom of political beliefs, freedom of speech, freedom of the
       press, the right to assemble, and the right to petition.
       1.1.3.2. Penalize or harass an individual for exercising rights guaranteed under the PA.
       We must reasonably help individuals exercise their rights under the PA.
    1.1.4. Air Force members will:
       1.1.4.1. Keep paper and electronic records that are retrieved by name or personal
       identifier only in approved PA systems published in the Federal Register.
       1.1.4.2. Collect, maintain, and use information in such systems, for purposes described in
       the published notice, to support programs authorized by law or Executive Order.
       1.1.4.3. Safeguard the records in the system and keep them the minimum time required.
       1.1.4.4. Ensure records are timely, accurate, complete, and relevant.
       1.1.4.5. Amend and correct records on request.
       1.1.4.6. Allow individuals to review and receive copies of their own records unless an
       exemption for the system has been published in the Federal Register; or the Air Force
       created the records in anticipation of a civil action or proceeding (Title 5 United States
       Code Section 552a(d)(5)).
AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                               7


       1.1.4.7. Provide a review of decisions that deny individuals access to or amendment
       of their records through appellate procedures.
1.2. Violation Penalties. An individual may file a civil law suit against the Air Force for failing
to comply with the PA. The courts may find an individual offender guilty of a misdemeanor and
fine that individual offender not more than $5,000 for:
   1.2.1. Willfully maintaining a system of records that doesn‘t meet the public notice
   requirements.
   1.2.2. Disclosing information from a system of records to someone not entitled to the
   information.
   1.2.3. Obtaining someone else‘s records under false pretenses.
1.3. Privacy Act Complaints. Process PA complaints or allegations of PA violations through
the appropriate base or MAJCOM PA office, to the local systems manager. The base or
MAJCOM PA officer directs the process and provides guidance to the system manager. The
local systems manager will investigate complaints, or allegations of PA violations; will establish
and review the facts when possible; interview individuals as needed; determine validity of the
complaint; take appropriate corrective action; and ensure a response is sent to the complainant
through the PA Officer. In cases where no system manager can be identified, the local PA
officer will assume these duties. Issues that cannot be resolved at the local level will be elevated
to the MAJCOM Privacy Office. When appropriate, local system managers will also: refer
cases for more formal investigation, refer cases for command disciplinary action, and consult
the servicing SJA.
   1.3.1. In unified combatant commands, process component unique system complaints
   through the respective component chain of command.
   1.3.2. For Privacy Act complaints filed in a U.S. District Court against the Air Force, an
   Air Force activity, or any Air Force employee, AFLSA/JACL will provide AF-CIO/P a
   litigation summary to include: the case number, requester name, the nature of the case
   (denial of access, refusal to amend, incorrect records, or specify the particular violation of
   the Privacy Act), date complaint filed, court, defendants, and any appropriate remarks, as
   well as updates during the litigation process. When the court renders a formal opinion or
   judgment, AFLSA/JACL sends AF-CIO/P a copy of the judgment and opinion.
1.4. Personal Notes. The Privacy Act does not apply to personal notes on individuals used as
memory aids. Personal notes may become Privacy Act records if they are retrieved by name or
other personal identifier and at least one of the following three conditions apply: (1) keeping or
destroying the records is not at the sole discretion of the author; (2) the notes are required by
oral or written directive, regulation, or command policy; or (3) they are shown to other agency
personnel.
1.5. Systems of Records Operated by a Contractor. Contractors who are required to operate
or maintain a PA system of records by contract must follow this instruction for collecting,
safeguarding, maintaining, using, accessing, amending and disseminating personal information.
The record system affected is considered to be maintained by the Air Force and is subject to
this instruction. Systems managers for offices who have contractors operating or maintaining

such record systems must ensure the contract contains the proper PA clauses, and identify the
record system number, as required by the Defense Acquisition Regulation and this instruction.
    1.5.1. Contracts for systems of records operated or maintained by a contractor will be
    reviewed annually by the appropriate MAJCOM Privacy Officer to ensure compliance with
    this instruction.
    1.5.2. Disclosure of personal records to a contractor for use in the performance of an Air

      OBTAINING LAW ENFORCEMENT RECORDS AND CONFIDENTIALITY
                            PROMISES

2.1. Obtaining Law Enforcement Records. The Commander, Air Force Office of Special
Investigation (AFOSI); the Commander, Air Force Security Forces Center (HQ AFSFC);
MAJCOM, FOA, and base chiefs of security forces; AFOSI detachment commanders; and
designees of those offices may ask another agency for records for law enforcement under 5
U.S.C. 552a(b)(7). The requesting office must indicate in writing the specific part of the record
desired and identify the law enforcement activity asking for the record.
2.2. Confidentiality Promises. Promises of confidentiality must be prominently annotated in
the record to protect from disclosure any ―confidential‖ information under 5 United States Code
552a (k)(2), (k)(5), or (k)(7) of the Privacy Act.
12                                               AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009


                                             Chapter 3

                         COLLECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION

3.1. How To Collect Personal Information. Collect personal information directly from the
subject of the record whenever possible. Only ask third parties when:
     3.1.1. You must verify information.
     3.1.2. You want opinions or evaluations.
     3.1.3. You can‘t contact the subject.
     3.1.4. You are doing so at the request of the subject individual.
3.2. When To Give Privacy Act Statements (PAS). Give a PAS orally or in writing to the
subject of the record when you are collecting information from them that will go in a system of
records. NOTE: Do this regardless of how you collect or record the answers. You may display
a sign in areas where people routinely furnish this kind of information. Give a copy of the PAS
if asked. Do not ask the person to sign the PAS.
     3.2.1. A PAS must include four items:
        3.2.1.1. Authority: The legal authority, that is, the U.S.C. or Executive Order authorizing
        the program the system supports.
        3.2.1.2. Purpose: The reason you are collecting the information and what you intend to do
        with it.
        3.2.1.3. Routine Uses: A list of where and why the information will be disclosed outside
        DOD.
        3.2.1.4. Disclosure: Voluntary or Mandatory. (Use Mandatory only when disclosure is
        required by law and the individual will be penalized for not providing information.)
        Include any consequences of nondisclosure in nonthreatening language.
3.3. Requesting the Social Security Number (SSN). When asking an individual for his or
her SSN, always give a Privacy Act Statement that tells the person: (1) the legal authority for
requesting it; (2) the uses that will be made of the SSN; and (3) whether providing the SSN is
voluntary or mandatory. Do not deny anyone a legal right, benefit, or privilege for refusing to
give their SSN unless the law requires disclosure, or a law or regulation adopted before January
1, 1975 required the SSN and the Air Force uses it to verify a person‘s identity in a system of
records established before that date.
     3.3.1. The Air Force requests an individual‘s SSN and provides the individual information
     required by law when anyone enters military service or becomes an Air Force civilian
     employee. The Air Force uses the SSN as a service or employment number to reference the
     individual‘s official records. When you ask someone for an SSN as identification to retrieve
     an existing record, you do not have to restate this information.
     3.3.2. Executive Order 9397, Numbering System for Federal Accounts Relating to
     Individual Persons, authorizes using the SSN as a personal identifier. This order is not
     adequate authority to collect an SSN to create a record. When law does not require
     disclosing the SSN or when the system of records was created after January 1, 1975, you
AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                           13


  may ask for the SSN, but the individual does not have to disclose it. If the individual refuses
  to respond, use alternative means of identifying records.
  3.3.3. SSNs are personal and unique to each individual. Protect them as FOR OFFICIAL
  USE ONLY (FOUO). Within DOD, do not disclose them to anyone without an official
  need to know. Outside DOD, they are not releasable without the person‘s consent, or unless
  authorized under one of the 12 exceptions to the Privacy Act (see paragraph 12.4).
14                                              AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009


                                            Chapter 4

                      GIVING ACCESS TO PRIVACY ACT RECORDS

4.1. Making a Request for Access. Persons or their designated representatives may ask for a
copy of their records in a system of records. Requesters need not state why they want access to
their records. Verify the identity of the requester to avoid unauthorized disclosures. How you
verify identity will depend on the sensitivity of the requested records. Persons may use a notary or
an unsworn declaration in the following format: ―I declare under penalty of perjury (if outside
the United States, add ―under the laws of the United States of America‖) that the foregoing is
true and correct. Executed on (date). (Signature).‖
4.2. Processing a Request for Access. Consider a request from an individual for his or her
own records in a system of records under both the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the
PA regardless of the Act cited. The requester does not need to cite either Act if the records they
want are contained in a system of records. Process the request under whichever Act gives the
most information. When necessary, tell the requester which Act you used and why.
     4.2.1. Requesters should describe the records they want. They do not have to name a
     system of records number, but they should at least name a type of record or functional area.
     For requests that ask for ―all records about me,‖ ask for more information and tell the person
     how to review the Air Force systems of records published in the Federal Register or at
     http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/notices/usaf.
     4.2.2. Requesters should not use government equipment, supplies, stationery, postage,
     telephones, or official mail channels for making PA requests. System managers will process
     such requests and tell requesters that using government resources to make PA requests is not
     authorized.
     4.2.3. Tell the requester if a record exists and how to review the record. If possible,
     respond to requests within 10 workdays of receipt. If you cannot answer the request in 10
     workdays, send a letter explaining why and give an approximate completion date no more
     than 20 workdays after the first office received the request.
     4.2.4. Show or give a copy of the record to the requester within 30 workdays of receiving the
     request unless the system has an exemption published in the Federal Register as a final rule.
     Give information in a form the requester can understand. If the system is exempt under the
     PA, provide any parts releasable under FOIA, with appeal rights (see Chapter 6), citing
     appropriate exemptions from the Privacy Act and FOIA, if applicable.
     4.2.5. If the requester wants another person present during the record review, the system
     manager may ask for written consent to authorize discussing the record with another person
     present.
4.3. Fees. Give the first 100 pages free, and charge only reproduction costs for the remainder.
Copies cost $.15 per page; microfiche costs $.25 per fiche. Charge fees for all pages for
subsequent requests for the same records. Do not charge fees:
     4.3.1. When the requester can get the record without charge under another publication (for
     example, medical records).
AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                              15


   4.3.2. For search.
   4.3.3. For reproducing a document for the convenience of the Air Force.
   4.3.4. For reproducing a record so the requester can review it.
   4.3.5. Fee waivers. Waive fees automatically if the direct cost of reproduction is less than
   $15, unless the individual is seeking an obvious extension or duplication of a previous request
   for which he or she was granted a waiver. Decisions to waive or reduce fees that exceed $15
   are made on a case-by-case basis.
4.4. Denying or Limiting Access. System managers process access denials within 5 workdays
after you receive a request for access. When you may not release a record, send a copy of the
request, the record, and why you recommend denying access (include the applicable
exemption) to the denial authority through the legal office and the PA office. Judge Advocate
(JA) offices will include a written legal opinion. The PA officer reviews the file, and makes a
recommendation to the denial authority. The denial authority sends the requester a letter with
the decision. If the denial authority grants access, release the record. If the denial authority
refuses access, tell the requester why and explain pertinent appeal rights (see Chapter 6).
   4.4.1. Before you deny a request for access to a record, make sure that:
       4.4.1.1. The system has an exemption published in the Federal Register as a final rule.
       4.4.1.2. The exemption covers each document. (All parts of a system are not
       automatically exempt.)
       4.4.1.3. Nonexempt parts are segregated.
   4.4.2. Special Provision for Certain Medical Records. If a physician believes that
   disclosing requested medical records could harm the person‘s mental or physical health, you
   should:
       4.4.2.1. Ask the requester to get a letter from a physician to whom you can send the
       records. Include a letter explaining to the physician that giving the records directly to the
       individual could be harmful.
       4.4.2.2. Offer the services of a military physician other than one who provided treatment
       if naming the physician poses a hardship on the individual.
       4.4.2.3. The Privacy Act requires that we ultimately ensure that the subject receives the
       records.
   4.4.3. Third Party Information in a Privacy Act System of Record. Ordinarily a person
   is entitled to their entire record under the Privacy Act. However, the law is not uniform
   regarding whether a subject is entitled to information that is not ―about‖ him or her (for
   example, the home address of a third party contained in the subject‘s records). Consult your
   servicing SJA before disclosing third party information. Generally, if the requester will be
   denied a right, privilege or benefit, the requester must be given access to relevant portions of
   the file.
   4.4.4. Information Compiled in Anticipation of Civil Action. Withhold records
   compiled in connection with a civil action or other proceeding including any action where
   the Air Force expects judicial or administrative adjudicatory proceedings. This exemption
16                                             AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009


     does not cover criminal actions. Do not release attorney work products prepared before,
     during, or after the action or proceeding.
4.5. Denial Authorities. These officials or a designee may deny access or amendment of
records as authorized by the Privacy Act. Send a letter to AF-CIO/P with the position titles of
designees. Authorities are:
     4.5.1. DCSs and chiefs of comparable offices or higher level at SAF or HQ USAF or
     designees.
     4.5.2. MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commanders or designees.
     4.5.3. HQ USAF/DPF, 1040 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1040 (for civilian
     personnel records).
     4.5.4. Commander, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), Washington DC
     20332-6001 (for AFOSI records).
     4.5.5. Unified Commanders or designees.
AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                          17

                                AMEND1NG THE RECORD

5.1. Amendment Reasons. Individuals may ask to have their records amended to make them
accurate, timely, relevant, or complete. System managers will routinely correct a record if the
requester can show that it is factually wrong (e.g., date of birth is wrong).
5.2. Responding to Amendment Requests.
   5.2.1. Anyone may request minor corrections orally. Requests for more serious
   modifications should be in writing.
   5.2.2. After verifying the identity of the requester, make the change, notify all known
   recipients of the record, and inform the individual.
   5.2.3. Acknowledge requests within 10 workdays of receipt. Give an expected completion
   date unless you complete the change within that time. Final decisions must take no longer
   than 30 workdays.
5.3. Approving or Denying a Record Amendment. The Air Force does not usually amend
a record when the change is based on opinion, interpretation, or subjective official judgment.
Determinations not to amend such records constitutes a denial, and requesters may appeal (see
Chapter 6).
   5.3.1. If the system manager decides not to amend the record, send a copy of the request, the
   record, and the recommended denial reasons to the denial authority through the legal office
   and the PA office. Legal offices will include a written legal opinion. The PA officer
   reviews the proposed denial and legal opinion and makes a recommendation to the denial
   authority.
   5.3.2. The denial authority sends the requester a letter with the decision. If the denial
   authority approves the request, amend the record and notify all previous recipients that it
   has been changed. If the authority denies the request, give the requester the statutory
   authority, reason, and pertinent appeal rights (see Chapter 6).
5.4. Seeking Review of Unfavorable Agency Determinations. Requesters should pursue
record corrections of subjective matters and opinions through proper channels to the Civilian
Personnel Office using grievance procedures or the Air Force Board for Correction of Military
Records (AFBCMR). Record correction requests denied by the AFBCMR are not subject to
further consideration under this instruction. Military personnel, other than USAF personnel,
should pursue service-unique record corrections through their component chain of command.
5.5. Contents of PA Case Files. Do not keep copies of disputed records in this file. File
disputed records in their appropriate series. Use the file solely for statistics and to process
requests. Do not use the case files to make any kind of determination about an individual.
Document reasons for untimely responses. These files include:
   5.5.1. Requests from and replies to individuals on whether a system has records about them.
   5.5.2. Requests for access or amendment.
   5.5.3. Approvals, denials, appeals, and final review actions.

                                             APPEALS

6.1. Appeal Procedures. Individuals who receive a denial to their access or amendment
request may request a denial review by writing to the Secretary of the Air Force, through the
denial authority, within60 calendar days after receiving a denial letter. The denial authority
promptly sends a complete appeal package to AFLSA/JACL. The package must include: (1) the
original appeal letter; (2) the initial request; (3) the initial denial; (4) a copy of the record; (5)
any internal records or coordination actions relating to the denial; (6) the denial authority‘s
comments on the appellant‘s arguments; and (7) the legal reviews.
   6.1.1. If the denial authority reverses an earlier denial and grants access or amendment,
   notify the requester immediately.
   6.1.2. AFLSA/JACL reviews the denial and provides a final recommendation to
   SAF/GCA. SAF/GCA tells the requester the final Air Force decision and explains judicial
   review rights.
   6.1.3. The requester may file a concise statement of disagreement with the system manager
   if SAF/ GCA denies the request to amend the record. SAF/GCA explains the requester‘s
   rights when they issue the final appeal decision.
   6.1.4. The records should clearly show that a statement of disagreement is filed with the
   record or separately.
   6.1.5. The disputed part of the record must show that the requester filed a statement of
   disagreement.
   6.1.6. Give copies of the statement of disagreement to the record‘s previous recipients.
   Inform subsequent record users about the dispute and give them a copy of the statement with
   the record.
   6.1.7. The system manager may include a brief summary of the reasons for not amending the
   record. Limit the summary to the reasons SAF/GCA gave to the individual. The summary is
   part of the individual‘s record, but it is not subject to amendment procedures.

                              PRIVACY ACT NOTIFICATIONS

7.1. When To Include a Privacy Act Warning Statement in Publications. Incl ud e a PA
Warni n g Statement in each Air Force publication that requires collecting or keeping
information in a system of records. Also include the Warning Statement when publications
direct collection of the SSN, or any part of the SSN, from the individual. The warning statement
will cite legal authority and when part of a record system, the PA system of records number and
title. You can use the following warning statement: ―This instruction requires collecting and
maintaining information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 authorized by (U.S.C. citation
and or Executive Order number). System of records notice (number and title) applies.‖
7.2. Warning Banners. Information systems that contain information on individuals that is
retrieved by name or personal identifier are subject to the Privacy Act. The Privacy Act requires
these systems to have a PA system notice published in the Federal Register that covers the
information collection before collection begins. In addition, all information systems subject to the
Privacy Act will have warning banners displayed on the first screen (at a minimum) to assist in
safeguarding the information. Use the following language for the banner: ―PRIVACY ACT
INFORMATION The information accessed through this system is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
and must be protected in accordance with the Privacy Act and AFI33-332.‖
7.3. Sending Personal Information Over Electronic Mail. Exercise caution before
transmitting personal information over e-mail to ensure it is adequately safeguarded. Some
information may be so sensitive and personal that e-mail may not be the proper way to transmit it.
When sending personal information over e-mail within DOD, ensure: (1) there is an official need;
(2) all addressee(s) (including ―cc‖ addressees) are authorized to receive it under the Privacy
Act; and (3) it is protected from unauthorized disclosure, loss, or alteration. Protection
methods may include encryption or password protecting the information in a separate
Word document. When transmitting personal information over e-mail, add ―FOUO‖ to the
beginning of the subject line, followed by the subject, and apply the following statement at the
beginning of the e-mail:
 ―This e-mail contains FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO) information which must be
 protected under the Privacy Act and AFI 33-332.‖
 Do not indiscriminately apply this statement to e-mails. Use it only in situations when you
 are actually transmitting personal information. DoD Regulation 5400.7/AF Supp, Chapter 4,
 provides additional guidance regarding FOUO information.
     7.3.1. Do not disclose personal information to anyone outside DOD unless specifically
     authorized by the Privacy Act (see paragraph 12.4).
     7.3.2. Do not send PA information to distribution lists or group e-mail addresses unless each
     member has an official need to know the personal information. When in doubt, send
     only to individual accounts.
     7.3.3. Before forwarding e-mails you have received that contain personal information,
     verify that your intended recipients are authorized to receive the information under the
     Privacy Act (see paragraph 12.4).

                            PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

8.1. Evaluating Information Systems for Privacy Act Compliance. Information system
owners and developers must address PA requirements in the development stage of the system
and integrate privacy protections into the development life cycle of the information system.
This is accomplished with a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA).
   8.1.1. The PIA addresses what information is to be collected; why the information is being
   collected; the intended use of the information; with whom the information will be shared;
   what notice or opportunities for the individual to decline or consent to providing the
   information collected, and how that information is shared; secured; and whether a system of
   records is being created, or an existing system is being amended. The E-Government Act of
   2002 requires PIAs to be conducted before:
       8.1.1.1. Developing or procuring information technology (IT) systems or projects that
       collect, maintain, or disseminate information in identifiable form from or about members
       of the public.
       8.1.1.2. Initiating a new electronic collection of information, in identifiable form for 10
       or more persons excluding agencies, instrumentalities, or employees of the Federal
       Government.
   8.1.2. In general, Privacy Impact Assessments are required to be performed and updated as
   necessary where a system change creates new privacy risks.
   8.1.3. No Privacy Impact Assessment is required where information relates to internal
   government operations, has been previously assessed under an evaluation similar to a Privacy
   Impact Assessment, or where privacy issues are unchanged.
   8.1.4. The depth and content of the Privacy Impact Assessment should be appropriate for
   the nature of the information to be collected and the size and complexity of the information
   technology system.
8.2. Conduct of PIA. The system owner will conduct a PIA as outlined in Attachment 4 and
send it to their MAJCOM Privacy Act office for review and final approval by the MAJCOM or
HAF Functional CIO. The MAJCOM or HAF Functional CIO will send a copy of the approved
PIAs to AF-CIO/P,1155 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1155; or e-mail
mailto:af.foia@pentagon.af.mil.
8.3. Posting of PIA. Whenever practicable, approved PIAs will be posted to the FOIA/Privacy
Act Web site for public access at http://www.foia.af.mil. (this requirement will be waived for
security reasons, or to protect classified, sensitive, or private information contained in an
assessment).

                                             Chapter 9

       PREPARING AND PUBLISHING SYSTEM NOTICES FOR THE FEDERAL
                              REGISTER

9.1. Publishing System Notices. The Air Force must publish notices in the Federal Register
of new, changed, and deleted systems to inform the public of what records the Air Force keeps
and give them an opportunity to comment before the system is implemented or changed. The PA
also requires submission of new or significantly changed systems to the OMB and both houses
of Congress before publication in the Federal Register. This includes:
     9.1.1. Starting a new system.
     9.1.2. Instituting significant changes to an existing system.
     9.1.3. Sending out data collection forms or instructions.
     9.1.4. Issuing a request for proposal or invitation for bid to support a new system.
9.2. Submitting Notices for Publication in the Federal Register. At least 120 days before
implementing a new system, or a major change to an existing system, subject to this
instruction, system managers must send a proposed notice, through the MAJCOM Privacy
Office, to AF-CIO/P. Send notices electronically to mail to af.foia@pentagon.af.mil using
Microsoft Word, using the Track Changes tool in Word to indicate additions/changes to existing
notices. Follow the format outlined in Attachment 2. For new systems, system managers must
include a statement that a risk assessment was accomplished and is available should the OMB
request it.
9.3. Reviewing Notices. System managers will review and validate their PA system notices
annually and submit changes to AF-CIO/P through the MAJCOM Privacy Office.
AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                            23


                                          Chapter 10

                     PROTECTING AND DISPOSING OF RECORDS

10.1. Protecting Records. Maintaining information privacy is the responsibility of every
federal employee, military member, and contractor who comes into contact with information in
identifiable form. Protect information according to its sensitivity level. Consider the personal
sensitivity of the information and the risk of disclosure, loss or alteration. Most information in
systems of records is FOUO. Refer to DoD 5400.7-RIAF Supp, DoD Freedom of Information
Act Program, for protection methods.
   10.1.1. (Added-AFDW) Personally Identifiable Information Checklist. In the event of a
   potential or actual breach or compromise of PII, AFDW personnel follow procedures
   outlined in Attachment 6, AFDW PII Checklist, and its supporting documents.
10.2. Balancing Protection. Balance additional protection against sensitivity, risk and cost. In
some situations, a password may be enough protection for an automated system with a log-on
protocol. Others may require more sophisticated security protection based on the sensitivity of
the information. Classified computer systems or those with established audit and password
systems are obviously less vulnerable than unprotected files. Follow AFI 33-202, Computer
Security, for procedures on safeguarding personal information in automated records.
   10.2.1. AF Form 3227, Privacy Act Cover Sheet, is optional and available for use with
   Privacy Act material. Use it to cover and protect personal information that you are using in
   office environments that are widely unprotected and accessible to many individuals. After
   use, such information should be protected as outlined in DoD 5400.7-RIAF Supp.
   10.2.2. Privacy Act Labels. Use of AFVA 33-276, Privacy Act Label, is optional to assist in
   protecting Privacy Act information on compact disks, diskettes, and tapes.
10.3. Disposing of Records. You may use the following methods to dispose of records
protected by the Privacy Act and authorized for destruction according to records retention
schedules:
   10.3.1. Destroy by any method that prevents compromise, such as tearing, burning, or
   shredding, so long as the personal data is not recognizable and beyond reconstruction.
   10.3.2. Degauss or overwrite magnetic tapes or other magnetic medium.
   10.3.3. Dispose of paper products through the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office or
   through activities that manage a base-wide recycling program. The recycling sales
   contract must contain a clause requiring the contractor to safeguard privacy material until
   its destruction and to pulp, macerate, shred, or otherwise completely destroy the records.
   Originators must safeguard PA material until it is transferred to the recycling contractor.
   A Federal employee or, if authorized, a contractor employee must witness the
   destruction. This transfer does not require a disclosure accounting.

                                            Chapter 11

                                PRIVACY ACT EXEMPTIONS

11.1. Exemption Types. There are two types of exemptions permitted by 5 U.S.C. 552a:
     11.1.1. A General exemption authorizes the exemption of a system of records from most
     parts of the PA.
     11.1.2. A Specific exemption authorizes the exemption of a system of records from only a
     few parts.
11.2. Authorizing Exemptions. Denial authorities may withhold records using Privacy Act
exemptions only when an exemption for the system of records has been published in the
Federal Register as a final rule. Attachment 3 lists the systems of records that have published
exemptions with rationale.
11.3. Requesting an Exemption. A system manager who believes that a system needs an
exemption from some or all of the requirements of the PA will send a request to AF-CIO/P
through the MAJCOM or FOA PA Officer. The request will detail the reasons for the exemption,
the section of the Act that allows the exemption, and the specific subsections of the PA from
which the system is to be exempted, with justification for each subsection.
11.4. Exemptions. Exemptions permissible under 5 U.S.C. 552a (subject to paragraph 11.2):
     11.4.1. The (j)(2) exemption. Applies to investigative records created and maintained by law-
     enforcement activities whose principal function is criminal law enforcement.
     11.4.2. The (k)(1) exemption. Applies to information specifically authorized to be classified
     according to DoD 5200.1R, Information Security Program.
     11.4.3. The (k)(2) exemption. Applies to investigatory information compiled for law-
     enforcement purposes by non law enforcement activities and which is not within the scope
     of the (j)(2) exemption (paragraph 11.4.1). However, the Air Force must allow an individual
     access to any record that is used to deny rights, privileges or benefits to which he or she
     would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he or she would otherwise be
     eligible as a result of the maintenance of the information (unless doing so would reveal a
     confidential source).
     11.4.4. The (k)(3) exemption. Applies to records maintained in connection with providing
     protective services to the President and other individuals under Title 18, U.S.C., Section
     3506.
     11.4.5. The (k)(4) exemption. Applies to records maintained solely for statistical research or
     program evaluation purposes and which are not used to make decisions on the rights, benefits,
     or entitlement of an individual except for census records which may be disclosed under Title
     13, U.S.C., Section 8.
     11.4.6. The (k)(5) exemption. Applies to investigatory material compiled solely for the
     purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian
     employment, military service, federal contracts, or access to classified information, but only
     to the extent such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source. This provision
AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                        25


  allows protection of confidential sources used in background investigations, employment
  inquiries, and similar inquiries that are for personnel screening to determine suitability,
  eligibility, or qualifications.
  11.4.7. The (k)(6) exemption. Applies to testing or examination material used solely to
  determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the federal or military
  service, if the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the test or
  examination process.
  11.4.8. The (k)(7) exemption. Applies to evaluation material used to determine potential for
  promotion in the Military Services, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such
  material would reveal the identity of a confidential source.
26                                                AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009


                                             Chapter 12

                        DISCLOSING RECORDS TO THIRD PARTIES

12.1. Disclosure Considerations. The Privacy Act requires the written consent of the
subject before releasing personal information to third parties, unless one of the 12 exceptions of
the Privacy Act applies (see paragraph 12.4). Use this checklist before releasing personal
information to third parties: (1) make sure it is authorized under the Privacy Act; (2) consider
the consequences; and (3) check the accuracy of the information. You can release personal
information to third parties when the subject agrees in writing. Air Force members consent to
releasing their home telephone number and address when they sign and check the ―Do
Consent‖ block on the AF Form 624, Base/Unit Locator and PSC Directory (see AFI33-329,
Base and Unit Personnel Locators).
     12.1.1. Social Rosters. Before including personal information such as spouses
     names, home addresses, home phones, and similar information on social rosters or
     directories that are shared with groups of individuals, ask for signed consent statements.
     Otherwise, do not include the information. Consent statements must give the individual a
     choice to consent or not consent, and clearly tell the individual what information is being
     solicited, the purpose, to whom you plan to disclose the information, and that consent is
     voluntary. Maintain the signed statements until no longer needed.
     12.1.2. Placing Personal Information on Shared Drives. Personal information should
     never be placed on shared drives for access by groups of individuals unless each person has
     an official need to know the information to perform their job. Add appropriate access
     controls to ensure access by only authorized individuals. Recall rosters are FOUO
     because they contain personal information and should be shared with small groups at the
     lowest levels for official purposes to reduce the number of people with access to such
     personal information. Commanders and supervisors should give consideration to those
     individuals with unlisted phone numbers, who do not want their number included on the
     office recall roster. In those instances, disclosure to the Commander or immediate supervisor,
     or deputy, should normally be sufficient.
     12.1.3. Personal Information That Requires Protection. Following are some examples
     of information that is not releasable without the written consent of the subject. This list is not
     all-inclusive.
        12.1.3.1. Marital status (single, divorced, widowed, separated).
        12.1.3.2. Number, name, and sex of dependents.
        12.1.3.3. Civilian educational degrees and major areas of study (unless the request for
        the information relates to the professional qualifications for Federal employment).
        12.1.3.4. School and year of graduation.
        12.1.3.5. Home of record.
        12.1.3.6. Home address and phone.
        12.1.3.7. Age and date of birth (year).
AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                               27


       12.1.3.8. Present or future assignments for overseas or for routinely deployable or
       sensitive units.
       12.1.3.9. Office and unit address and duty phone for overseas or for routinely deployable
       or sensitive units.
       12.1.3.10. Race/ethnic origin
       12.1.3.11. Educational level (unless the request for the information relates to the
       professional qualifications for Federal employment).
       12.1.3.12. Social Security Number.
12.2. Releasable Information. Following are examples of information normally releasable to
the public without the written consent of the subject. This list is not all-inclusive.
   12.2.1. Name.
   12.2.2. Rank.
   12.2.3. Grade.
   12.2.4. Air Force specialty code.
   12.2.5. Pay (including base pay, special pay, all allowances except Basic Allowance for
   Quarters and Variable Housing Allowance).
   12.2.6. Gross salary for civilians.
   12.2.7. Past duty assignments, unless sensitive or classified.
   12.2.8. Present and future approved and announced stateside assignments.
   12.2.9. Position title.
   12.2.10. Office, unit address, and duty phone number (CONUS only).
   12.2.11. Date of rank.
   12.2.12. Entered on active duty date.
   12.2.13. Pay date.
   12.2.14. Source of commission.
   12.2.15. Professional military education.
   12.2.16. Promotion sequence number.
   12.2.17. Military awards and decorations.
   12.2.18. Duty status of active, retired, or reserve.
   12.2.19. Active duty official attendance at technical, scientific, or professional meetings.
   12.2.20. Biographies and photos of key personnel.
   12.2.21. Date of retirement, separation.
12.3. Disclosing Other Information. Use these guidelines to decide whether to release
information:
28                                              AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009


     12.3.1. Would the subject have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information
     requested?
     12.3.2. Would disclosing the information benefit the general public? The Air Force
     considers information as meeting the public interest standard if it reveals anything regarding
     the operations or activities of the agency, or performance of its statutory duties.
     12.3.3. Balance the public interest against the individual‘s probable loss of privacy. Do not
     consider the requester‘s purpose, circumstances, or proposed use.
12.4. Rules for Releasing Privacy Act 1nformation Without Consent of the Subject. T h e
P r i v a c y Act prohibits disclosing personal information to anyone other than the subject of the
record without his or her written consent. There are twelve exceptions to the ―no disclosure
without consent‖ rule . Those exceptions permit release of personal information without the
individual‘s consent only in the following instances:
     12.4.1. Exception 1. DOD employees who have a need to know the information in the
     performance of their official duties.
     12.4.2. Exception 2. In response to a FOIA request for information contained in a system of
     records about an individual and the FOIA requires release of the information.
     12.4.3. Exception 3. To agencies outside DOD, only for a Routine Use published in the
     Federal Register. The purpose of the disclosure must be compatible with the intended
     purpose of collecting and maintaining the record. When initially collecting the information
     from the subject, the Routine Uses block in the Privacy Act Statement must name the
     agencies and reason.
        12.4.3.1. In addition to the Routine Uses established by the Department of the Air
        Force within each system of records, the DOD has established ―Blanket Routine Uses‖
        that apply to all record systems maintained by the Department of the Air Force. These
        ―Blanket Routine Uses‖ have been published only once at the beginning of the
        Department of the Air Force‘s Federal Register compilation of record systems notices in
        the interest of simplicity, economy and to avoid redundancy. Unless a system notice
        specifically excludes a system of records from a ―Blanket Routine Use,‖ all ―Blanket
        Routine Uses‖ apply to that system (see Attachment 5).
     12.4.4. Exception 4. The Bureau of the Census to plan or carry out a census or survey under
     Title 13, U.S.C. Section 8.
     12.4.5. Exception 5. A recipient for statistical research or reporting. The recipient must give
     advanced written assurance that the information is for statistical purposes only. NOTE: No
     one may use any part of the record to decide on individuals‘ rights, benefits, or entitlements.
     You must release records in a format that makes it impossible to identify the real subjects.
     12.4.6. Exception 6. The National Archives and Records Administration to evaluate records
     for permanent retention. Records stored in Federal Records Centers remain under Air Force
     control.
     12.4.7. Exception 7. A Federal, State, or local agency (other than DOD) for civil or
     criminal law enforcement. The head of the agency or a designee must send a written request
     to the system manager specifying the record or part needed and the law enforcement
     purpose. In addition, the ‗blanket routine use‘ for law enforcement allows the system
AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                             29


   manager to disclose a record to a law enforcement agency if the agency suspects a criminal
   violation.
   12.4.8. Exception 8. An individual or agency that needs the information for compelling
   health or safety reasons. The affected individual need not be the record subject.
   12.4.9. Exception 9. Either House of Congress, a congressional committee, or a
   subcommittee, for matters within their jurisdictions. The request must come from the
   committee chairman or ranking minority member (see AFI 90-401).
       12.4.9.1. Requests from a Congressional member acting on behalf of the record subject
       are evaluated under the routine use of the applicable system notice. If the material for
       release is sensitive, get a release statement.
       12.4.9.2. Requests from a Congressional member not on behalf of a committee or the
       record subject are properly analyzed under the FOIA, and not under the PA.
   12.4.10. Exception 10. The Comptroller General or an authorized representative of the
   General Accounting Office (GAO) to conduct official GAO business.
   12.4.11. Exception 11. A court of competent jurisdiction, with a court order signed by a
   judge.
   12.4.12. Exception 12. A consumer reporting agency in accordance with Title 31 U.S.C.
   Section3711(e). Ensure category element is represented within the system of records notice.
12.5. Disclosing the Medical Records of Minors. A ir Force personnel may disclose the
medical records of minors to their parents or legal guardians in conjunction with applicable
Federal laws and guidelines. The laws of each state define the age of majority.
   12.5.1. The Air Force must obey state laws protecting medical records of drug or alcohol
   abuse treatment, abortion, and birth control. If you manage medical records, learn the local
   laws and coordinate proposed local policies with the servicing SJA.
   12.5.2. Outside the United States (overseas), the age of majority is 18. Unless parents or
   guardians have a court order granting access or the minor‘s written consent, they will not
   have access to minor‘s medical records overseas when the minor sought or consented to
   treatment between the ages of 15 and17 in a program where regulation or statute provides
   confidentiality of records and he or she asked for confidentiality.
12.6. Disclosure Accountings. System managers must keep an accurate record of all
disclosures made from any system of records except disclosures to DOD personnel for official
use or disclosures under the FOIA. System managers may use AF Form 771, Accounting of
Disclosures. Retain disclosure accountings for 5 years after the disclosure, or for the life of the
record, whichever is longer.
   12.6.1. System managers may file the accounting record any way they want as long as they
   give it to the subject on request, send corrected or disputed information to previous record
   recipients, explain any disclosures, and provide an audit trail for reviews. Include in each
   accounting:
       12.6.1.1. Release date.
       12.6.1.2. Description of information.
30                                             AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009


        12.6.1.3. Reason for release.
        12.6.1.4. Name and address of recipient.
     12.6.2. Some exempt systems let you withhold the accounting record from the subject.
     12.6.3. You may withhold information about disclosure accountings for law enforcement
     purposes at the law enforcement agency‘s request.
12.7. Computer Matching. Computer matching programs electronically compare records
from two or more automated systems that may include DOD, another Federal agency, or a state
or other local government A system manager proposing a match that could result in an
adverse action against a Federal employee must meet these requirements of the PA: (1) prepare
a written agreement between participants; (2) secure approval of the Defense Data Integrity
Board; (3) publish a matching notice in the Federal Register before matching begins; (4) ensure
full investigation and due process; and (5) act on the information, as necessary.
     12.7.1. The PA applies to matching programs that use records from: Federal personnel or
     payroll systems and Federal benefit programs where matching: (1) determines Federal
     benefit eligibility; (2) checks on compliance with benefit program requirements; (3)
     recovers improper payments or delinquent debts from current or former beneficiaries.
     12.7.2. Matches used for statistics, pilot programs, law enforcement, tax administration,
     routine administration, background checks and foreign counterintelligence, and internal
     matching that won‘t cause any adverse action are exempt from PA matching requirements.
     12.7.3. Any activity that expects to participate in a matching program must contact AF-
     CIO/P immediately. System managers must prepare a notice for publication in the Federal
     Register with a Routine Use that allows disclosing the information for use in a matching
     program. Send the proposed system notice to AF-CIO/P. Allow 180 days for processing
     requests for a new matching program.
     12.7.4. Record subjects must receive prior notice of a match. The best way to do this is to
     include notice in the Privacy Act Statement on forms used in applying for benefits.
     Coordinate computer matching statements on forms with AF-CIO/P through the MAJCOM
     PA Officer.
12.8. Privacy and the Web. Do not post personal information on publicly accessible DOD
web sites unless clearly authorized by law and implementing regulation and policy.
Additionally, do not post personal information on .mil private web sites unless authorized by
the local commander, for official purposes, and an appropriate risk assessment is performed.

     12.8.1. Ensure public Web sites comply with privacy policies regarding restrictions on
     persistent and third party cookies, and add appropriate privacy and security notices at major
     web site entry points and Privacy Act statements or Privacy Advisories when collecting
     personal information. Notices must clearly explain where the collection or sharing of
     certain information is voluntary, and notify users how to provide consent.
     12.8.2. Include a Privacy Act Statement on the web page if it collects information directly
     from an individual that we maintain and retrieve by his or her name or personal identifier
     (i.e., SSN). We may only maintain such information in approved PA systems of records that
     are published in the Federal Register. Inform the visitor when the information is

  maintained and retrieved by name or personal identifier in a system of records; that the
  Privacy Act gives them certain rights with respect to the government‘s maintenance and use
  of information collected about them, and provide a link to the Air Force Privacy Act
  policy and system notices at http://www.foia.af.mil..
  12.8.3. Anytime a web site solicits personally-identifying information, even when not
  maintained in a PA system of records, it requires a Privacy Advisory. The Privacy Advisory
  informs the individual why the information is solicited and how it will be used. Post the
  Privacy Advisory to the web page where the information is being solicited, or through a
  well-marked hyperlink ―Privacy Advisory Please refer to the Privacy and Security Notice
  that describes why this information is collected and how it will be used.‖

A3.1. All systems of records maintained by the Department of the Air Force shall be exempt
from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) to the extent that
the system contains any information properly classified under Executive Order 12958 and that
is required by the Executive Order to be kept classified in the interest of national defense or
foreign policy. This exemption is applicable to parts of all systems of records including those not
otherwise specifically designated for exemptions herein, which contain isolated items of properly
classified information.
A3.2. An individual is not entitled to have access to any information compiled in reasonable
anticipation of a civil action or proceeding (5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(5)).
A3.3. No system of records within Department of the Air Force shall be considered exempt under
subsection (j) or (k) of the Privacy Act until the exemption rule for the system of records has
been published as a final rule in the Federal Register.
A3.4. Consistent with the legislative purpose the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of the
Air Force will grant access to nonexempt material in the records being maintained. Disclosure

investigation of an actual or potential violation will not be alerted to the investigation; the
physical safety of witnesses, informants, and law enforcement personnel will not be endangered,
the privacy of third parties will not be violated; and that the disclosure would not otherwise
impede effective law enforcement. Whenever possible, information of the above nature will
be deleted from the requested documents and the balance made available. The controlling
principle behind this limited access is to allow disclosures except those indicated above. The
decisions to release information from these systems will be made on a case-by-case basis.
A3.5. General Exemption. The following systems of records claim an exemption under Title
5 U.S.C., Section 552a(j)(2), with the exception of F090 AF IG B, Inspector General Records
and F051 AF JA F, Courts-Martial and Article 15 Records. They claim both the (j)(2) and

in this system would inform the subject of an investigation of existence of that investigation,
provide subject of the investigation with information that might enable him to avoid
detection, and would present a serious impediment to law enforcement.
                            (E) From subsection (e)(4)(H) because system of records is
exempt from individual access pursuant to subsection (j) of the Privacy Act of 1974.

(e)(8), (f), and (g).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
               (iii) Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure
accounting, for disclosures pursuant to the routine uses published for this system, would
permit the subject of a criminal investigation or matter under investigation to obtain valuable
information concerning the nature of that investigation which will present a serious
impediment to law enforcement.
                               (B) From subsection (c)(4) because an exemption is being
claimed for subsection (d), this subsection will not be applicable.
                              (C) From subsection (d) because access to the records contained
in this system would inform the subject of a criminal investigation of the existence of that
investigation, provide the subject of the investigation with information that might enable him
to avoid detection or apprehension, and would present a serious impediment to law
enforcement.
42                                             AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009


                               (D) From subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious
impediment to law enforcement in that it could compromise the existence of a confidential
investigation, reveal the identity of confidential sources of information and endanger the life
and physical safety of confidential informants.

                              (E) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) because this system of
 records is exempt from individual access pursuant to subsections (j)(2) of the Privacy Act of
 1974.
                               (F) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because the identity of specific
 sources must be withheld in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and
 other law enforcement information. This exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy
 and physical safety of witnesses and informants.
                               (G) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of
 information for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance what
 information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the passage of time, seemingly
 irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new significance as further investigation
 brings new details to light and the accuracy of such information can only be determined in a
 court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would restrict the ability of trained
 investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise their judgment reporting on investigations
 and impede the development of intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.
                               (H) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice
 requirements of subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to law enforcement as
 this could interfere with the ability to issue search authorizations and could reveal
 investigative techniques and procedures.
                             (I) From subsection (f) because this system of records has been
 exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).
                             (J) From subsection (g) because this system of records
 compiled for law enforcement purposes and has been exempted from the access provisions of
 subsections (d) and (f).
     A3.5.6. System identifier and name: F090 AF IG B, Inspector General Records.
                (i) Exemption: (A) Parts of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to
                5 U.S.C.552a(j)(2) if the information is compiled and maintained by a
                component of the agency which performs as its principle function any activity
                pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. Therefore, portions of this
                system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from the
                following subsections of 5U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3),
                (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g).
                                (B) Investigative material compiled for law enforcement
 purposes, other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be
 exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right,
 privilege, or benefit for which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he
 would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual
AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                43


will be provided access to the information exempt to the extent that disclosure would reveal
the identity of a confidential source. NOTE: When claimed, this exemption allows limited
protection of investigative reports maintained in a system of records used in personnel or
administrative actions. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant
to 5 U.S.C.552a(k)(2) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1),
(e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and(f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2).

               (iii) Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of accounting of
disclosure would inform a subject that he or she is under investigation. This information
would provide considerable advantage to the subject in providing him or her with knowledge
concerning the nature of the investigation and the coordinated investigative efforts and
techniques employed by the cooperating agencies. This would greatly impede the Air Force
IG‘s criminal law enforcement.
                                  (B) From subsection (c)(4) and (d), because notification would
alert a subject to the fact that an open investigation on that individual is taking place, and might
weaken the on going investigation, reveal investigative techniques, and place confidential
informants in jeopardy.
                                (C) From subsection (e)(1) because the nature of the criminal
and/or civil investigative function creates unique problems in prescribing a specific parameter
in a particular case with respect to what information is relevant or necessary. Also, information
may be received which may relate to a case under the investigative jurisdiction of another
agency. The maintenance of this information may be necessary to provide leads for
appropriate law enforcement purposes and to establish patterns of activity that may relate to
the jurisdiction of other cooperating agencies.
                                (D) From subsection (e)(2) because collecting information to
the fullest extent possible directly from the subject individual may or may not be practical in
a criminal and/or civil investigation.
                               (E) From subsection (e)(3) because supplying an individual
with a form containing a Privacy Act Statement would tend to inhibit cooperation by many
individuals involved in a criminal and/or civil investigation. The effect would be somewhat
adverse to established investigative methods and techniques.
                              (F) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) because this system
of records is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) and (f).
                              (G) From subsection (e)(5) because the requirement that
records be maintained with attention to accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness
would unfairly hamper the investigative process. It is the nature of law enforcement for
investigations to uncover the commission of illegal acts at diverse stages. It is frequently
impossible to determine initially what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and least of all
complete. With the passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may acquire
new significance as further investigation brings new details to light.
                               (H) From subsection (e)(8) because the notice requirements of
44                                             AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009


 this provision could present a serious impediment to law enforcement by revealing
 investigative techniques, procedures, and existence of confidential investigations.
                                (I) From subsection (f) because the agency‘s rules are
 inapplicable to those portions of the system that are exempt and would place the burden on
 the agency of either confirming or denying the existence of a record pertaining to a requesting
 individual might in itself provide an answer to that individual relating to an on going
 investigation. The conduct of a successful investigation leading to the indictment of a
 criminal offender precludes the applicability of established agency rules relating to
 verification of record, disclosure of the record to that individual, and record amendment
 procedures for this record system.
                               (J) From subsection (g) because this system of records should
 be exempt to the extent that the civil remedies relate to provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a from
 which this rule exempts the system.
     A3.5.7. System identifier and name: F051 AF JA F, Courts-Martial and Article 15 Records.
                 (i) Exemptions: (A) Parts of this system may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
 552a(j)(2) if the information is compiled and maintained by a component of the agency which
 performs as its principle function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws.
 Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2)
 from the following subsection of 5 U.S.C.552a(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3),
 (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g).
                                 (B) Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement
 purposes, other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be
 exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right,
 privilege, or benefit for which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he
 would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual
 will be provided access to the information exempt to the extent that disclosure would reveal
 the identify of a confidential source. NOTE: When claimed, this exemption allows limited
 protection of investigative reports maintained in a system of records used in personnel or
 administrative actions. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant
 to 5 U.S.C.552a(k)(2) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1),
 (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and(f).
                (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2).
                (iii) Reason: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure
 accounting, for disclosures pursuant to the routine uses published for this system, would
 permit the subject of a criminal investigation or matter under investigation to obtain valuable
 information concerning the nature of that investigation which will present a serious
 impediment to law enforcement.
                                (B) From subsection (c)(4) because an exemption is being
 claimed for subsection (d), this subsection will not be applicable.
                               (C) From subsection (d) because access to the records contained
 in this system would inform the subject of a criminal investigation of the existence of that
 investigation, provide the subject of the investigation with information that might enable him
AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                             45


to avoid detection or apprehension, and would present a serious impediment to law
enforcement.
                               (D) From subsection (e)(1) because in the course of criminal
investigations information is often obtained concerning the violation of laws or civil
obligations of others not relating to an active case or matter. In the interests of effective law
enforcement, it is necessary that this information be retained since it can aid in establishing
patterns of activity and provide valuable leads for other agencies and future cases that may be
brought.
                               (E) From subsection (e)(2) because in a criminal investigation
the requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent possible from the subject
individual would present a serious impediment to law enforcement in that the subject of the
investigation would be placed on notice of the existence of the investigation and would
therefore be able to avoid detection.
                             (F) From subsection (e)(3) because the requirement that
individuals supplying information be provided with a form stating the requirements of
subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious impediment to law enforcement in that it could
compromise the existence of a confidential investigation, reveal the identity of confidential
sources of information and endanger the life and physical safety of confidential informants.

                            (G) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) because this system of
records is exempt from individual access pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy
Act of 1974.
                              (H) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because the identity of specific
sources must be withheld in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and
other law enforcement information. This exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy
and physical safety of witnesses and informants.
                              (I) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of
information for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance what
information is accurate, relevant timely, and complete. With the passage of time, seemingly
irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new significance as further investigation
brings new details to light and the accuracy of such information can only be determined in a
court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would restrict the ability of trained
investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise their judgment in reporting on
investigations and impede the development of intelligence necessary for effective law
enforcement.
                              (J) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice
requirements of subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to law enforcement as
this could interfere with the ability to issue search authorizations and could reveal
investigative techniques and procedures.
                            (K) From subsection (f) because this system of records has
been exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).
                              (L) From subsection (g) because this system of records is
46                                              AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009


 compiled for law enforcement purposes and has been exempted from the access provisions of
 subsections (d) and (f).
A3.6. Specific Exemptions. The following systems of records are subject to the specific
exemptions shown:
     A3.6.1. System identifier and name: F036 USAFA K, Admissions Records.
                 (i) Exemption. Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion
 in the Military Services may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7), but only to the extent
 that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identify of a confidential source.
 Therefore, portions of this system of records (Liaison Officer Evaluation and Selection Panel
 Candidate Evaluation) may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7) from the following
 subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), (e)(4)(H), and (f).
                (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7).
                (iii) Reasons. To ensure the frankness of information used to determine whether
 cadets are qualified for graduation and commissioning as officers in the Air Force. P

                (i) Exemption: Testing or examination material used solely to determine
 individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the federal or military service, if
 the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the test or examination
 process may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.552a(k)(6), if the disclosure would compromise
 the objectivity or fairness of the test or examination process. Therefore, portions of this
 system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) from the following
 subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); and (f).

                 (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6).

                (iii) Reasons: To protect the objectivity of the promotion testing system by
 keeping the test questions and answers in confidence.
     A3.6.3. System identifier and name: F036 USAFA A, Cadet Personnel Management System.
                 (i) Exemption: Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion
 in the Military Services may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7), but only to the extent
 that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identify of a confidential source.
 Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7)
 from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C.552a(d), (e)(4)(H), and (f).
                (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7).
                (iii) Reasons: To maintain the candor and integrity of comments needed to
                evaluate an Air Force Academy cadet for commissioning in the Air Force.
     A3.6.4. System identifier and name: F036 AETC I, Cadet Records.
               (i) Exemption: Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of
 determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military
AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                             47


service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5
U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a
confidential source. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to
5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) (Detachment Professional Officer Course Selection Rating Sheets; Air
Force Reserve Officer Training Corps Form 0—24—Disenrollment Review; Memoranda for
Record and Staff Papers with Staff Advice, Opinions, or Suggestions) may be exempt from the
following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
                 (iii) Reasons: To protect the identity of a confidential source who furnishes
information necessary to make determinations about the qualifications, eligibility, and
suitability of cadets for graduation and commissioning in the Air Force.
  A3.6.5. System identifier and name: F044 AF SG Q, Family Advocacy Program Records.
                (i) Exemption: (A) Investigative material compiled for law enforcement
purposes, other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be
exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right,
privilege, or benefit for which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he
would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual
will be provided access to the information exempt to the extent that disclosure would reveal
the identify of a confidential source. NOTE: When claimed, this exemption allows limited
protection of investigative reports maintained in a system of records used in personnel or
administrative actions.
                               (B) Investigative material compiled solely for the purpose of
determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military
service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5
U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a
confidential source.
                           (C) Therefore, portions of this system of records may be
exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (k)(5) from the following subsections of 5
U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (k)(5).

               (iii) Reasons: From subsections (c)(3) and (d) because the exemption is
needed to encourage those who know of exceptional medical or educational conditions or
family maltreatments to come forward by protecting their identities and to protect such
sources from embarrassment or recriminations, as well as to protect their right to privacy. It is
essential that the identities of all individuals who furnish information under an express
promise of confidentiality be protected. Granting individuals access to information relating to
criminal and civil law enforcement, as well as the release of certain disclosure accounting,
could interfere with ongoing investigations and the orderly administration of justice, in that it
could result in the concealment, alteration, destruction, or fabrication of information; could
hamper the identification of offenders or alleged offenders and the disposition of charges; and
could jeopardize the safety and well being of parents and their children. Exempted portions of
this system also contain information considered relevant and necessary to make a
48                                              AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009


 determination as to qualifications, eligibility, or suitability for Federal employment and
 Federal contracts, and that was obtained by providing an express or implied promise to the
 source that his or her identity would not be revealed to the subject of the record.
     A3.6.6. System identifier and name: F036 AF PC A, Effectiveness/Performance Reporting
     System.
             (i) Exemption: Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in
             the Military Services (Brigadier General Selectee Effectiveness Reports and
             Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel Pro-motion Recommendations with close out
             dates on or before January 31, 1991) may be exempt pursuant to5 U.S.C.
             552a(k)(7), but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal
             the identity of a confidential source. Therefore, portions of this system of records
             may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.552a(k)(7) from the following subsections of
             5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(4)(H), and (f).
             (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7).
             (iii) Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because making the disclosure
             accounting available to the individual may compromise express promises of
             confidentiality by revealing details about the report and identify other record
             sources, which may result in circumvention of the access exemption.
                           (B) From subsection (d) because individual disclosure compromises
                           express promises of confidentiality conferred to protect the
                           integrity of the promotion rating system.
                           (C) From subsection (e)(4)(H) because of and to the extent that
                           portions of this record system are exempt from the individual
                           access provisions of subsection (d).
                           (D) From subsection (f) because of and to the extent that portions
                           of this record system are exempt from the individual access
                           provisions of subsection (d).
     A3.6.7. System identifier and name: F036 AFDP A, Files on General Officers and Colonels
     Assigned to General Officer Positions.
                 (i) Exemption: Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion
 in the Military Services may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7), but only to the extent
 that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identify of a confidential source.
 Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7)
 from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C.552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); and (f).
                (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7).
                (iii) Reasons: To protect the integrity of information used in the Reserve Initial
                BrigadierGeneral Screening Board, the release of which would compromise
                the selection process.
     A3.6.8. System identification and name: F036 AF PC O, General Officer Personnel Data

                (i) Exemption: Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion
AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                            49


               in the Military Services may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7), but
               only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identify
               of a confidential source. Therefore, portions of this system of records (Air
               Force General Officer Promotion and Effectiveness Reports with close out
               dates on or before January 31, 1991) may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
               552a(k)(7) may be exempt from following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3),
               (d), (e)(4)(H), and (f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7).
               (iii) Reason: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because making the disclosure
accounting available to the individual may compromise express promises of confidentiality
by revealing details about the report and identify other record sources, which may result in
circumvention of the access exemption.
                              (B) From subsection (d) because individual disclosure
compromises express promises of confidentiality conferred to protect the integrity of the
promotion rating system.
                              (C) From subsection (e)(4)(H) because of and to the extent that
portions of this record system are exempt from the individual access provisions of subsection
(d).
                              (D) From subsection (f) because of and to the extent that
                              portions of this record system are exempt from the individual
                              access provisions of subsection (d).
  A3.6.9. System identifier and name: F036 AFPC K, Historical Airman Promotion Master

               (i) Exemption: Testing or examination material used solely to determine
               individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the federal or
               military service, if the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness
               of the test or examination process may be exempt pursuant to 5
               U.S.C.552a(k)(6), if the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or
               fairness of the test or examination process. Therefore, portions of this system
               of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) from the following
               subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6).
               (iii) Reasons: To protect the integrity, objectivity, and equity of the promotion
testing system by keeping test questions and answers in confidence.Reserved.
  A3.6.10. System identifier and name: F071 AF OSI F, Investigative Applicant Processing
  Records.
               (i) Exemption: Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of
               determining suit-ability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian
               employment, military service, federal contracts, or access to classified
               information may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but only to the
               extent that such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source.
               Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5

                U.S.C.552a(k)(5) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C.552a(c)(3), (d),
                (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f).
                (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
                 (iii) Reasons: To protect those who gave information in confidence during Air
 Force Office of Special Investigations applicant inquiries. Fear of harassment could cause
 sources not to make frank and open responses about applicant qualifications. This could
 compromise the integrity of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations personnel program
 that relies on selecting only qualified people.

                (i) Exemptions: Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion
in the Military Services may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7), but only to the extent
that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identify of a confidential source.
Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7)
from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C.552a(d), (e)(4)(H), and (f).
                (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7).

                (i) Exemption: (A) Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement
purposes, other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be
exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right,
privilege, or benefit for which he would other-wise be entitled by Federal law or for which he
would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual
will be provided access to the information exempt to the extent that disclosure would reveal
the identify of a confidential source. NOTE: When claimed, this exemption allows limited
protection of investigative reports maintained in a system of records used in personnel or
administrative actions.
                               (B) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of
determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military
service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5
U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a
confidential source.
                               (C) Therefore, portions of this system of records may be
exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (k)(5) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C.
552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f).
                (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (k)(5).
               (iii) Reasons: To protect the identity of sources to which proper promises of
confidentiality have been made during investigations. Without these promises, sources will

               (iii) Reasons: To protect the identity of those who give information in
confidence for personnel security and related investigations. Fear of harassment could cause
sources to refuse to give this information in the frank and open way needed to pinpoint those
areas in an investigation that should be expanded to resolve charges of questionable conduct.
  A3.6.14. System identifier and name: F031 497IG B, Special Security Case Files.
                (i) Exemption: Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of
determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military
service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5
U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a
confidential source. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to
5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C.
552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
               (iii) Reasons: To protect the identity of those who give information in
confidence for personnel security and related investigations. Fear of harassment could cause
sources to refuse to give this information in the frank and open way needed to pinpoint those
areas in an investigation that should be expanded to resolve charges of questionable conduct.
  A3.6.15. System identifier and name: F031 AF SP N, Special Security Files.
                (i) Exemption: Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of
determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military
service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5
U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a
confidential source. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to
5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C.
552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).

                (i) Exemption: Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of
 determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military
 service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5
 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a
 confidential source. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to
 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) from the following subsection of 5 U.S.C.552a(d).
                (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
                 (iii) Reasons: To protect the identity of confidential sources who furnish
 information necessary to make determinations about the qualifications, eligibility, and
 suitability of health care professionals who apply for Reserve of the Air Force appointment or
 interservice transfer to the Air Force.
     A3.6.17. System identifier and name: F036 AF DPG, Military Equal Opportunity and
     Treatment.
                (i) Exemption: Investigative material compiled for law enforcement purposes,
 other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be exempt
 pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege, or
 benefit for which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he would
 otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual will be
 provided access to the information exempt to the extent that disclosure would reveal the
 identity of a confidential source. NOTE: When claimed, this exemption allows limited
 protection of investigative reports maintained in a system of records used in personnel or
 administrative actions.Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant
 to 5 U.S.C. 522a(k)(2) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), (e)(4)(H), and (f).
                (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2)
                 (iii) Reasons: (A) From subsection (d) because access to the records contained
 in this system would inform the subject of an investigation of the existence of that
 investigation, provide the subject of the investigation with information that might enable him
 to avoid detection, and would present a serious impediment to law enforcement. In addition,
 granting individuals access to information collected while an Equal Opportunity and
 Treatment clarification/investigation is in progress conflicts with the just, thorough, and timely
 completion of the complaint, and could possibly enable individuals to interfere, obstruct, or
 mislead those clarifying/investigating the complaint.
                             (B) From subsection (e)(4)(H) because this system of records is
 exempt from individual access pursuant to subsection (k) of the Privacy Act of 1974.
                             (C) From subsection (f) because this system of records has been
 exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).

                (i) Exemption: Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes,
AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                            53


other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be exempt
pursuant to 5 U.S.C.552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege, or
benefit for which he would other-wise be entitled by Federal law or for which he would
otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual will be
provided access to the information except to the extent that disclosure would reveal the
identity of a confidential source. NOTE: When claimed, this exemption allows limited
protection of investigative reports maintained in a system of records used in personnel or
administrative actions. Any portion of this system of records which falls within the
provisions of 5 U.S.C.552a(k)(2) may be exempt from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C.
552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G),(H), and (I), and (f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).
                (iii) Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because to grant access to the
accounting for each disclosure as required by the Privacy Act, including the date, nature, and
purpose of each disclosure and the identity of the recipient, could alert the subject to the
existence of the investigation. This could seriously compromise case preparation by
prematurely revealing its existence and nature; compromise or interfere with witnesses or
make witnesses reluctant to cooperate; and lead to suppression, alteration, or destruction of
evidence.
                               (B) From subsections (d) and (f) because providing access to
investigative records and the right to contest the contents of those records and force changes
to be made to the information contained therein would seriously interfere with and thwart the
orderly and unbiased conduct of the investigation and impede case preparation. Providing
access rights normally afforded under the Privacy Act would provide the subject with
valuable information that would allow interference with or compromise of witnesses or render
witnesses reluctant to cooperate; lead to suppression, alteration, or destruction of evidence;
enable individuals to conceal their wrongdoing or mislead the course of the investigation; and
result in the secreting of or other disposition of assets that would make them difficult or
impossible to reach in order to satisfy any Government claim growing out of the investigation
or proceeding.
                              (C) From subsection (e)(1) because it is not always possible to
detect the relevance or necessity of each piece of information in the early stages of an
investigation. In some cases, it is only after the information is evaluated in light of other
evidence that its relevance and necessity will be clear.
                             (D) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) because this system of
records is compiled for investigative purposes and is exempt from the access provisions of
subsections (d) and (f).
                              (E) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because to the extent that this
provision is construed to require more detailed disclosure than the broad, generic information
currently published in the system notice, an exemption from this provision is necessary to
protect the confidentiality of sources of information and to protect privacy and physical
safety of witnesses and informants.

 determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military
 service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5
 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a
 confidential source. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to
 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C.552a(c)(3), (d), and (e)(1).
                (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
                  (iii) Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) and (d) when access to accounting
 disclosures and access to or amendment of records would cause the identity of a confidential
 source to be revealed. Disclosure of the source‘s identity not only will result in the
 Department breaching the promise of confidentiality made to the source but it will impair the
 Department‘s future ability to compile investigatory material for the purpose of determining
 suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment, Federal contracts, or
 access to classified information. Unless sources can be assured that a promise of
 confidentiality will be honored, they will be less likely to provide information considered
 essential to the Department in making the required determinations.
                                 (B) From subsection (e)(1) because in the collection of
 information for investigatory purposes, it is not always possible to determine the relevance
 and necessity of particular information in the early stages of the investigation. In some cases,
 it is only after the information is evaluated in light of other information that its relevance and
 necessity becomes clear. Such information permits more informed decision-making by the
 Department when making required suitability, eligibility, and qualification determinations.

                 (i) Exemption: During the processing of a Freedom of Information Act
 request, exempt materials from ‗other‘ systems of records may in turn become part of the case
 record in this system. To the extent that copies of exempt records from those other systems of
 records are entered into this system, the Department of the Air Force hereby claims the same
 exemptions for the records from those ‗other‘ systems that are entered into this system, as
 claimed for the original primary system of which they are a part.
                (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), (k)(2), (k)(3), (k)(4), (k)(5), (k)(6),
                and (k)(7).
                (iii) Reasons: Records are only exempt from pertinent provisions of 5 U.S.C.
                552a to the extent such provisions have been identified and an exemption
                claimed for the original record, and the purposes underlying the exemption for
                the original record still pertain to the record which is now contained in this
                system of records. In general, the exemptions were claimed in order to protect
                properly classified information relating to national defense and foreign policy,
                to avoid interference during the conduct of criminal, civil, or administrative
                actions or investigations, to ensure protective services provided the President
                and others are not compromised, to protect the identity of confidential sources
                incident to Federal employment, military service, contract, and security
                clearance determinations, and to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of

entered into this system, the Department of the Air Force hereby claims the same exemptions
for the records from those ‗other‘ systems that are entered into this system, as claimed for the

               552a to the extent such provisions have been identified and an exemption
               claimed for the original record, and the purposes underlying the exemption for
               the original record still pertain to the record which is now contained in this
               system of records. In general, the exemptions were claimed in order to protect
               properly classified information relating to national defense and foreign policy,

                              PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENT

 Section A4A—Introduction and Overview
A4.1. The Privacy Act Assessment. The Air Force recognizes the importance of protecting the
privacy of individuals, to ensure sufficient protections for the privacy of personal information
as we implement citizen-centered e-Government. Privacy issues must be addressed when systems
are being developed, and privacy protections must be integrated into the development life cycle
of these automated systems. The vehicle for addressing privacy issues in a system under
development is the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). The PIA process also provides a means to
assure compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing individual privacy.
     A4.1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this document is to:
        A4.1.1.1. Establish the requirements for addressing privacy during the systems
        development process.
        A4.1.1.2. Describe the steps required to complete a PIA. A4.1.1.3. Define the privacy
        issues you will address in the PIA.
     A4.1.2. Background. The Air Force is responsible for ensuring the privacy, confidentiality,
     integrity, and availability of personal information. The Air Force recognizes that privacy
     protection is both a personal and fundamental right. Among the most basic of individuals‘
     rights is an expectation that the Air Force will protect the confidentiality of personal,
     financial, and employment information. Individuals also have the right to expect that the Air
     Force will collect, maintain, use, and disseminate identifiable personal information and data
     only as authorized by law and as necessary to carry out agency responsibilities. Personal
     information is protected by the following:

   A4.1.3. The Air Force Privacy Office is in the Office of the Air Force Chief Information
   Officer (AF-CIO), Directorate of Plans and Policy, and is responsible for overseeing Air
   Force implementation of the Privacy Act.
A4.2. System Privacy. Rapid advancements in computer technology make it possible to
store and retrieve vast amounts of data of all kinds quickly and efficiently. These
advancements have raised concerns about the impact of large computerized information systems
on the privacy of data subjects. Public concerns about highly integrated information systems
operated by the government make it imperative to commit to a positive and aggressive approach
to protecting individual privacy. AF-CIO is requiring the use of this PIA in order to ensure that
the systems the Air Force develops protect individuals‘ privacy. The PIA incorporates privacy
into the development life cycle so that all system development initiatives can appropriately
consider privacy issues from the earliest stages of design.
Section A4B—Privacy and Systems Development
   A4.2.1. What is a Privacy Impact Assessment? The PIA is a process used to evaluate privacy
   in information systems. The process is designed to guide system owners and developers in
   assessing privacy through the early stages of development. The process consists of privacy
   training, gathering data from a project on privacy issues, and identifying and resolving
   the privacy risks. The PIA process is described in detail in Section A4C. Completing a
   Privacy Impact Assessment.
   A4.2.2. When is a PIA Done? The PIA is initiated in the early stages of the development of a
   system and completed as part of the required system life cycle reviews. Privacy must be
   considered when requirements are being analyzed and decisions are being made about data
   usage and system design. This applies to all of the development methodologies and system
   life cycles used in the Air Force.
   A4.2.3. Who completes the PIA? Both the system owner and system developers must work
   together to complete the PIA. System owners must address what data is to be used, how the
   data is to be used, and who will use the data. The system developers must address whether
   the implementation of the owner‘s requirements presents any threats to privacy.
   A4.2.4. What systems have to complete a PIA? Accomplish PIAs when:
       A4.2.4.1. Developing or procuring information technology (IT) that collects, maintains,
       or disseminates information. in identifiable form from or about members of the public.
       A4.2.4.2. Initiating a new collection of information, using IT, that collects, maintains, or
       disseminates information in identifiable form for 10 or more persons excluding agencies,
       instrumentalities, or employees of the Federal Government.
       A4.2.4.3. Systems as described above that are undergoing major modifications.
   A4.2.5. The Air Force or MAJCOM Privacy Act Officer reserves the right to request that a
   PIA be completed on any system that may have privacy risks.
A4.3. The PIA. This section describes the steps required to complete a PIA. These steps are
summarized in Table A4.1, Outline of Steps for Completing a PIA.

A4.4. Training. Training on the PIA will be available, on request, from the MAJCOM
Privacy Act Officer. The training consists of describing the PIA process and provides detail
about the privacy issues and privacy questions to be answered to complete the PIA.
MAJCOM Privacy Act Officers may use Attachment 4, Section A4A, Section A4B, Section
A4D and Section A4E. for this purpose. The intended audience is the personnel responsible for
writing the PIA document.
A4.5. The PIA Document. Preparing the PIA document requires the system owner and
developer to answer the privacy questions in Section A4E. A brief explanation should be
written for each question. Issues that do not apply to a system should be noted as ―Not
Applicable‖. During the development of the PIA document, the MAJCOM Privacy Act Officer
will be available to answer questions related to the PIA process and other concerns that may arise
with respect to privacy.
A4.6. Review of the PIA Document. Submit the completed PIA document to the MAJCOM
Privacy Act Office for review. The purpose of the review is to identify privacy risks in the
system.
A4.7. Approval of the PIA. The system life cycle review process (Command, Control,
Communications, Computers, and Intelligence Support Plan) will be used to validate the
incorporation of the design requirements to resolve the privacy risks. MAJCOM and HAF
Functional CIOs will issue final approval of the PIA.

 Amended             specifically:


                     Each agency that maintains a system of records shall:
                      maintain in its records only such information about an individual as
                     is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency

                     timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure
                     fairness to the individual in the determination;
                       establish appropriate administrative, technical and physical
                     safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of records and to
                     protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or
                     integrity which could result in substantial harm, embarrassment,
                     inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual on whom information
                     is maintained.

 Information and     To fulfill the commitment of the Air Force to protect personal
 Privacy             information, several issues must be addressed with respect to privacy.
                     The use of information must be controlled. Information may be used
                     only for a necessary and lawful purpose.
                     Individuals must be informed in writing of the principal purpose and
                     routine uses of the information being collected from them.
                     Information collected for a particular purpose should not be used for
                     another purpose without the data subject‘s consent unless such other
                     uses are specifically authorized or mandated by law.
                     Any information used must be sufficiently accurate, relevant, timely
                     and complete to assure fair treatment of the individual.


                     Given the availability of vast amounts of stored information and the
                     expanded capabilities of information systems to process the
                     information, it is foreseeable that there will be increased requests to
                     share that information. With the potential expanded uses of data in
                     automated systems it is important to remember that information can
                     only be used for the purpose for which it was collected unless other
                     uses are specifically authorized or mandated by law. If the data is to
                     be used for other purposes, then the public must be provided notice of
                     those other uses.
                     These procedures do not in themselves create any legal rights, but are
                     intended to express the full and sincere commitment of the Air Force
                     to protect individual privacy rights and which provide redress for
                     violations of those rights.
 Data   in     the   The sources of the information in the system are an important privacy
 System              consideration if the data is gathered from other than Air Force
                     records. Information collected from non-Air Force sources should be
                     verified, to the extent practicable, for accuracy, that the information is
                     current, and complete. This is especially important if the information
                     will be used to make determinations about individuals.
 Access   to   the   Who has access to the data in a system must be defined and
AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                          61


 Data              documented.
                   Users of the data can be individuals, other systems, and other
                   agencies. Individuals who have access to the data can be system
                   users, system administrators, system owners, managers, and
                   developers. When individuals are granted access to a system, their
                   access should be limited, where possible, to only that data needed to
                   perform their assigned duties. If individuals are granted access to all
                   of the data in a system, procedures need to be in place to deter and
                   detect browsing and unauthorized access. Other systems are any
                   programs or projects that interface with the system and have access to
                   the data. Other agencies can be International, Federal, state, or local
                   entities that have access to Air Force data.
 Attributes of the When requirements for the data to be used in the system are being
 Data              determined, those requirements must include the privacy attributes of
                   the data. The privacy attributes are derived from the legal
                   requirements imposed by The Privacy Act of 1974. First, the data
                   must be relevant and necessary to accomplish the purpose of the
                   system. Second, the data must be complete, accurate, and timely. It is
                   important to ensure the data has these privacy attributes in order to
                   assure fairness to the individual in making decisions based on the
                   data.
 Maintenance of    Automation of systems can lead to the consolidation of processes,
 Administrative    data, and the controls in place to protect the data. When
 Controls          administrative controls are consolidated, they should be evaluated so
                   that all necessary controls remain in place to the degree necessary to
                   continue to control access to and use of the data. Document record
                   retention procedures and coordinate them with the MAJCOM

                             SAMPLE NOTIFICATION LETTER

     Dear Mr. John Miller:

     On January 1, 2006, a DoD laptop computer was stolen from the parked car of a DoD
     employee in Washington, D.C. after normal duty hours while the employee was running a
     personal errand. The laptop contained personally identifying information on 100 DoD
     employees who were participating in the xxx Program. The compromised information is
     the name, social security number, residential address, date of birth, office and home email
     address, office, and home telephone numbers of the program participants.

     The theft was immediately reported to local and DoD law enforcement authorities, who
     are now conducting a joint inquiry into the loss.

     We believe that the laptop was the target of the theft as opposed to any information that
     the laptop might contain. Because the information in the laptop was password protected
     and encrypted, we also believe that the probability is low that the information will be
     acquired and used for an unlawful purpose. However, we cannot say with certainty that
     this might not occur. We therefore believe that you should consider taking such actions as
     are possible to protect against the potential that someone might use the information to
     steal your identity.

     You should be guided by the actions recommended by the Federal Trade Commission
     (FTC) at its web site at http://www.ftc.gov/idtheft. The FTC urges that you immediately
     place an initial fraud alert on your credit file. The Fraud alert is for a period of 90 days,
     during which, creditors are required to contact you before a new credit card is issued or an
     existing card changed. The site also provides other valuable information that can be taken
     now or in the future if problems should develop.

     The Department of Defense takes this loss very seriously and is reviewing its current
     policies and practices with a view of determining what must be changed to preclude a
     similar occurrence in the future. At a minimum, we will be providing additional training
     to personnel to ensure that they understand that personally identifiable information must
     at all times be treated in a manner that preserves and protects the confidentiality of the
     data.

                                              RISK ASSESSMENT MODEL


No.          Factor           Risk                Low:        Comments:
                              Determination       Moderate:   All breaches of PII, whether actual or suspected, require notification to
                                                  High:       US-CERT
                                                              Low and moderate risk/harm determinations and the decision whether
                                                              notification of individuals is made, rest with the Head of the DoD
                                                              Component where the breach occurred
                                                              All determinations of high risk or harm require notifications

1.    What is the nature of
      the data elements
      breached? What PII
      was involved?
      a. Name only            Low                             Consideration needs to be given to unique names; those where one or
                                                              only a few in the population may have or those that could readily identify
                                                              an
                                                              individual, i.e., public figure

2.    Number of                                               The number of individuals involved is a determining factor in how
      Individuals Affected                                    notifications are made, not whether they are made

3.    What is the
      likelihood the
      information is
      accessible and
      usable? What level of
      protection applied to
      this information?
      a. Encryption (FIPS     Low

4.    Likelihood the          High/Moderate/Low               Determining likelihood depends on the manner of the breach and the
      Breach May Lead to                                      type(s) of data involved
      Harm

5.    Ability of the Agency
      to Mitigate the Risk
      of Harm
      a. Loss                 High                            Evidence exists that PII has been lost; no longer under DoD control

      b. Theft                High                            Evidence shows that PII has been stolen and could possibly be used to
                                                              commit ID theft?

      c. Compromise           High
      (1) Compromise          Low                             No evidence of malicious intent
      w/I DoD control         High                            Evidence or possibility of malicious intent

                             Attachment 10 (Added-AFDW)
               PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENT (PIA) WORKSHEET


   1. Department of Defense (DoD) Component.
   ** United States Air Force (USAF)

   2. Name of Information Technology (IT) System.
   ** Provide the full name of your IT investment as reported in the (Enterprise Information
   Technology Data Repository (EITDR) at https://www.my.af.mil/eitdrprod via the Air
   Force Portal at http://www.my.af.mil ) or on your Federal Information Security
   Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) report.

   3. Budget System Identification Number (SNAP-IT Initiative Number).
   - the portfolio's number assigned by SNAP-IT, which is a repository for Capital
   Investment Reporting (CIR), Selected Capital Investment Reporting (SCIR), and Exhibit
   53 data. Exhibit 53 data is an electronically-submitted, format-consistent form required
   by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for capital investment requests. The
   Budget System Identification Number replaced the AF- and DoD-ITMA (Information
   Technology Management Application) number.
   ** This is the "BIN" number at the upper right area of EITDR for your investment. Or
   write “Not Applicable.”

   4. System Identification Number(s) (IT Registry/Defense IT Portfolio Repository
   (DITPR)).
   - the portfolio‘s number assigned by the DoD Information Technology Portfolio
   Repository (DITPR)
   ** This is the "DITPR" number given at the upper right area of EITDR for your
   investment. Or write “Not Applicable.”

   5. IT Investment (Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11) Unique
   Identifier (if applicable).
   - 2007 Unique Project Identifier (UPI) means the unique project identifier used to report
   the investment in the 2007 Budget. As agencies capital planning processes mature and
   investments are aligned to the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA), the unique project
   identifiers should be changed to match the appropriate FEA Mappings. Indicating the
   UPI used for the 2007 Budget process allows cross-walk and historical analysis crossing
   fiscal years for tracking purposes.
   - The UPI is composed of the Agency Code, Bureau Code, GIG Group, Mission Area
   (where appropriate), Investment Type, Initiative Number (ideally, each IT investment
   should be matched with an initiative), and Part Reporting.
   ** This is the number given at EITDR question G11 for your investment. However, if
   there are question marks for any box in G11 (especially the Initiative Number), write
   “Not Applicable.”
80                                             AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009


     6. Privacy Act System of Records Notice (SORN) Identifier (if applicable).
     - identifies the applicable Privacy Act system of records notice.
     ** Air Force Privacy Act System of Records Notices (SORNs) are found at
     http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/notices/usaf/ . The primary DoD webpage for SORNs
     is http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/notices/ . Or write “Not Applicable.” Note that
     this response will be matched against the response in question 19 below.
     A system is required to be covered by a Privacy Act System of Records Notice if
     (1) it contains a "personal identifier" (e.g., name, Social Security
     Number, etc - not just from members of the general public but also from DoD military
     and civilian members),
     (2) it contains at least one other item of personally identifiable information (e.g., home
     address, race, etc), and
     (3) the records in the system are retrieved by a "personal identifier".
     Note that a system affected by this requirement doesn‟t need to have its own SORN
     created if there exists a SORN elsewhere that covers it (e.g., “blanket routine uses”
     SORNs at http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/notices/blanket-uses.html , one of the USAF
     SORNs at http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/notices/usaf/ , another DoD service‟s
     SORN at http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/notices/ , another Federal agency‟s SORN).
     If a new SORN is created for a system, contact your MAJCOM Privacy Act Office on how
     to complete one for publication in the Federal Register -
     http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/index.html .

     7. OMB Information Collection Requirement Number (if applicable) and
     Expiration Date.
     - Part 1320 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations (Reference (g)) at
     http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/5cfr1320_07.html directs that public
     information collections be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for
     approval and assigned an OMB control number.
     ** Provide the OMB Control Numbers, expiration dates, and titles of any information
     collection requests (e.g. forms, surveys, etc.) contained in the IT investment and approved
     by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) -
     http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/891001p.pdf .
     Are any forms being used to collect data for your IT investment? If yes, what is the form
     number, and what is the OMB authorization and expiration? The Air Force forms
     website is located at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil ; links to other websites with forms
     are also listed. If the forms used do not have any OMB information, write “not
     applicable”.
     For example, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) at
     http://www.dfas.mil/more/dfasfreedomofinformationactprivacyact/dfaspia.html has a
     Privacy Impact Assessment for the "Defense Debt Management System (DDMS)". Item 7
     for the DDMS Privacy Impact Assessment has "DD Form 2789, Waiver/Remission of
     Indebtedness Application, OMB No. 0730-0009, OMB approval expires November 30,
     2008." At the DD forms website (
     http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/ddforms2500-2999.htm ) for DD Form
     2789, the OMB information appears at the upper right area of the form (
     http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/eforms/dd2789.pdf ).
AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                             81


   Note that if the form or survey you are using has an OMB expiration date that has
   already transpired, check http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain , click the 'down
   wedge', click 'Department of Defense', and click 'Submit' under "Currently under
   Review" to see the status of the form or survey. Write the result for your response.
   Or write “Not Applicable”.

   8. Type of authority to collect information (statutory or otherwise).
   ** What specific authorities, arrangements, and/or agreements define the collection of
   the data in the IT investment? Include the authorities to collect the Privacy Act data, if
   applicable.
   Be consistent with what you have written in the System of Records Notice for your IT
   investment. Air Force SORNs are listed at
   http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/notices/usaf/ .
   Do not cite any subordinate publications below the Air Force level (e.g., per MAJCOM
   Instruction 33-12345, Air Force Base Regulation 31-6789).
   Be careful of citing any superseded, obsolete, or rescinded publications.
   USAF instructions are found at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/ .
   DoD publications are found at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/ .
   Public Laws are found at http://www.gpoaccess.gov/plaws/index.html .
   United States Codes are found at http://www.gpoaccess.gov/uscode/index.html .
   Code of Federal Regulations are found at http://www.gpoaccess.gov/cfr/index.html .
   Executive Orders are found at http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executiveorders/
   disposition.html .
   Commonly cited authorities are Executive Order 9397 (use of Social Security Numbers)
   and 10 United States Code 8013 (Secretary of Air Force, powers and duties); however,
   try to apply authorities specific to your program.

   9. Provide a brief summary or overview of the IT system (activity/purpose, present
   lifecycle phase, system owner, system boundaries and interconnections, location of
   system and components, and system backup).
   ** Provide information on what the investment does, who it serves, the office that owns
   the IT investment, point of contact name, telephone number, email, etc. Length of this
   entry will depend on the size and complexity of the IT investment and its subsystems,
   where relevant. However, keep information assurance and operational security in mind
   while responding to this question.

   10. Describe what information in identifiable form will be collected and the nature
   and source of the information (e.g. names, Social Security Numbers, gender, race,
   other component IT systems, IT systems from agencies outside Department of
   Defense (DoD), etc.).
   ** List the identifiable information being collected and its source.

   11. Describe how the information will be collected (e.g., via the Web, via paperbased
   collection, etc.).
   ** Address how you are collecting the information (via the web, via paper-based
   collection, via exchanges from other data systems, etc.) from the subject individual or
82                                              AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009


     other sources, etc. Describe why information from “other sources” is required.

     12. Describe the requirement and why the information in identifiable form is to be
     collected (e.g., to discharge a statutory mandate, to execute a Component program,
     etc.).
     ** Describe why the personally identifiable information collected and stored in the IT
     investment is necessary to the Air Force/DoD mission, e.g., to discharge a statutory
     mandate, to execute a Component program, to verify an individual‟s identity, etc.

     13. Describe how the information in identifiable form will be used (e.g., to verify
     existing data, etc.).
     ** Identify and list each use (internal and external to Air Force/DoD) of the personally
     identifiable information collected and maintained. If a Privacy Act System of Records
     Notice exists, summarize the most relevant uses/routine uses.

     14. Describe whether the system derives or creates new data about individuals
     through aggregation.
     ** Describe if the investment creates or makes available new or previously unavailable
     information about an individual, state/explain what will be done with the newly derived
     information, i.e., collect multiple pieces of personally identifiable information data from
     various sources on an individual, thereby creating a new data profile for that person.
     For example, an IT investment may collect data on an individual‟s first name, say
     „John‟, and last name, say „Doe‟, and then concatenates the first name and last name to
     create a new data item called „name‟, say „John Doe.‟

     15. Describe with whom the information in identifiable form will be shared, both
     within the Component and outside the Component (e.g., other DoD Components,
     Federal agencies, etc.).
     ** Internal to Air Force - Describe with whom the information will be shared within Air
     Force/DoD and uses made of the data. All individuals accessing information contained
     in an IT investment or a Privacy Act system of records are to have taken Information
     Assurance and Privacy Act training, and thus made aware of the consequences of
     inappropriately using information contained therein.
     ** External to Air Force - Describe with whom the information will be shared outside the
     DoD. Where a specific authority exists to share the information, please provide the
     authority citation. If a Privacy Act system of records is involved with the IT investment,
     the data may also be provided under any of the routine uses published in the system of
     records notice and/or the DoD “Blanket Routine Uses” published at
     http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/notices/blanket-uses.html , if applicable.

     16. Describe any opportunities individuals will have to object to the collection of
     information in identifiable form about themselves or to consent to the specific uses
     of the information in identifiable form. Where consent is to be obtained, describe
     the process regarding how the individual is to grant consent.
     ** Can the individual refuse to provide personally identifiable information for this IT
     investment?
AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                              83


   Example:
   -- All personal data collected is voluntarily given by the subject individual. Forms that
   collect personal data to be maintained in this IT investment contain a Privacy Act
   Statement, as required by 5 USC 552a(e)(3) at
   http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/Title_05.txt , allowing the individual to make an
   informed decision about providing the data. The statement advises the individual that the
   information provided is voluntary and provides the consequences of choosing not to
   participate with the information collection. Individuals may raise an objection with the
   Air Force Privacy Act office during the public comment period of the Privacy Act system
   of records notice (if applicable) or during the data collection.
   -- The subject individual initiates the collection and maintenance of his/her information
   for the purpose of [ insert purpose ]. Release of this information is done
   with the individual‟s full cooperation and consent.
   -- Data is provided by other Federal agencies, State and local government organizations,
   and private sector entities. Information may also be purchased from commercial
   databases for inclusion in this IT investment. Information collected from non-DoD
   sources should be verified, to the extent practicable, for accuracy, that the collection is
   current, and the information is complete. This is especially important if the information
   will be used to make determinations about individuals.

   17. Describe any information that is provided to an individual and the format of
   such information (Privacy Act Statement, Privacy Advisory) as well as the means of
   delivery (e.g., written, electronic, etc.), regarding the determination to collect the
   information in identifiable form.
   ** Example:
   -- A Privacy Act System of Records Notice was published in the Federal Register with a
   30 day public comment period. Forms that collect personal data will contain a Privacy
   Act Statement, as required by 5 USC 552a(e)(3), allowing the individual to make an
   informed decision about providing the data or participating in the program. Individuals
   may raise an objection with the Air Force Privacy Act Office during the comment period,
   during data collection, or at any time after the program is launched. If no objections are
   received, consent is presumed.
   -- AFI 33-332, “Privacy Act Program”, http://www.e-publishing.af.mil , governs Privacy
   Act data collections in the Air Force. AFI 33-129, “Web Management and Internet Use”
   discusses data collection and privacy policies. Air Force civilian employees, military
   members, and contractors are required to be aware of Privacy Act issues (e.g. via
   Privacy Act training offered by your MAJCOM/DRU/FOA/base/Privacy Act website,
   etc.) to fulfill their duties in handling third party personal data and in learning their
   Privacy Act rights.

   18. Describe the administrative/business, physical, and technical processes and
   controls adopted to secure, protect, and preserve the confidentiality of the
   information in identifiable form.
   ** For these three entries, describe the controls adopted to secure, protect, and preserve
   the confidentiality of the information in identifiable form. Your response should provide
   a general description of the privacy protections and controls in place to preserve the
84                                            AFI33-332_AFDWSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2009


     confidentiality of the information under your control.
     Administrative:
     Physical:
     Technical:
     However, keep information assurance and operational security in mind while
     responding to this question.

     19. Identify whether the IT system or collection of information will require a
     System of Records notice as defined by the Privacy Act of 1974 and as implemented
     by Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5400.11, DoD Privacy Program, May 8,
     2007; and DoD 5400.11-R, Department of Defense Privacy Program, May 14, 2007.
     If so, and a System Notice has been published in the Federal Register, the Privacy
     Act System of Records Identifier must be listed in question 6 above. If not yet
     published, state when publication of the Notice will occur.
     ** Entry will be "Not Applicable" for those IT investments that do not require a Privacy
     Act System of Records Notice. For those that do require a Privacy Act System of Records
     Notice, identify the notice and provide the system name. All Air Force Privacy Act
     System of Records Notices are found at http://www.dod.mil/privacy/notices/usaf/ . For
     more information, contact the Privacy Office at your base or MAJCOM/DRU/FOA.

     20. Describe/evaluate any potential privacy risks regarding the collection, use, and
     sharing of the information in identifiable form. Describe/evaluate any privacy risks
     in providing individuals an opportunity to object/consent or in notifying individuals.
     Describe/evaluate further any risks posed by the adopted security measures.
     ** Response should indicate privacy risks unique to your IT investment. Do not provide
     generic language about the results of a privacy breach in general. Be specific to the
     risks that a privacy breach involving your IT investment and its data would generate. Do
     not provide specific information about the name/vendor/operating system of any security
     measures you identify.
     For example, if your IT investment consists of a Microsoft Access database, don‟t list
     the existing vulnerabilities in unpatched Microsoft Access programs. Instead, provide
     any vulnerabilities specific to your IT investment (e.g. lack of a username/password
     which can allow unauthorized users to obtain information in your Access application).

     21. State classification of information/system and whether the PIA should be
     published or not. If not, provide rationale. If a PIA is planned for publication, state
     whether it will be published in full or summary form.
     ** Classification: “Unclassified” is the common choice. If you need more information,
     contact your base Security Manager or reference Appendix 3 of DoD 5200.1-R, January
     1997 at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/520001r.pdf .
     ** Publication: This document will be published either in full or in summary form on the
     Air Force Privacy Act website, http://www.foia.af.mil/Privacy/PrivImpAssess.shtml .

     Note: After the Program Manager signs the Privacy Impact Assessment as the Preparing
     Official and the Program Manager‘s Information Assurance Official (a computer
     professional who is familiar with the IT investment) signs the PIA, then the PIA and its
     signature page should be sent to the 744 CS/SCOKP Privacy Act Office. That office will
     review the PIA for privacy risks, concur when it is satisfied, and forward the PIA package
     to the AFDW Privacy Act Manger. The Air Force Privacy Act Officer and the HQ Air
     Force Information Assurance Official will review the PIA package and sign if they
     concur. The Air Force Privacy Act Office reserves the right to edit the PIA. Then the PIA
     is sent to the SAF/XC Chief Information Officer (Reviewing Official). Afterwards, the
     PIA (edited for information assurance and operational security) will be posted at
     http://www.foia.af.mil/Privacy/PrivImpAssess.shtml for viewing by the general public.
     The PIA package is sent to Office of the Secretary of Defense‘s Chief Information Office
     (OSD CIO), which will forward the package to the Office of Management and Budget
     (OMB).

     When the process completes, the Program Manager can make the appropriate updates to
     the Privacy Act questions in EITDR. However, the Program Manager should make
     updates as needed to the PIA in the event there is a significant change in the personally
     identifiable information collected, security features implemented, etc.
