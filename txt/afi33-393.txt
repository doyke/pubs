This Instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 33-3, Information Management.
Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Title 29 United States Code Section 794d), as
amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-220), requires all Federal
agencies to make their Electronic and Information Technology (E&IT) accessible to people with
disabilities when they develop, procure, maintain, or use E&IT products. Section 508 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is applicable to E&IT developed or having major modification after
21 June 2001. This instruction applies to all Air Force active duty military, civilians, and
contractors in the performance of their duties to an Air Force contract, the Air Force Reserve, Air
National Guard, and Civil Air Patrol when performing functions for the Air Force, and in
accordance with DoD Directive (DoDD) 5100.3, Support of the Headquarters of Combatant and
Subordinate Unified Commands. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this
publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance
statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, Table 1.1 for a description of
the authorities associated with the Tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers through the chain
of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the Publication
OPR for non-tiered compliance items. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force Records Information Management System
(AFRIMS), or any updated statement provided by the AF Records Management office (SAF/CIO

A6XA). Send recommended changes or comments to Secretary of the Air Force, Cyberspace
Capabilities and Compliance (SAF/CIO A6X), 1800 AF Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-

Publication. See Attachment 1 for a glossary of references and supporting information.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises AFI 33-393 by (1) adding tiering, IAW AFIS and AFI 33-360,
Publications and Forms Management, and (2) updating office symbols and email addresses to
reflect current organizations.
1. Background. In 1998 Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act to include enforcement
language that supports the requirement for Federal agencies to make their E&IT accessible to
people with disabilities. Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers in information
technology, to make available new opportunities for people with disabilities, and to encourage
development of technologies that will help achieve these goals. Under Section 508 (29 USC §
794d), agencies must give employees and members of the public with disabilities access to
information that is comparable to the access available to others.
2. General. The Air Force corporate approach to Section 508 implementation follows the
guidelines established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) of “centralized
management with decentralized execution.” This approach provides a corporate strategy that
will lead the Air Force to its goal: “To provide an Air Force-wide coordinated Section 508
effort that addresses all legal requirements and provides maximum access to E&IT while
maintaining full mission focus and capabilities.” The Chief of Information Dominance and
Chief Information Officer (SAF/CIO A6) has overall responsibility for addressing Section 508
challenges and to ensure the Air Force Section 508 project addresses E&IT accessibility issues
before they adversely affect the mission and mission support functions. Conquering Section 508
challenges will require the cooperative efforts of content managers, developers, contracting
officers, program managers, portfolio managers and requiring officials at every Air Force level.
People with disabilities must be given the opportunity to maximize their contribution to the
success of the Air Force mission by maximizing the accessibility features of E&IT equipment.
3. Roles and Responsibilities. Successful implementation of Section 508 hinges on the
coordination of many groups throughout the Department of Defense (DoD) and within the Air
Force.

Terms
Content Manager (Web Master)—The individual, USAF active duty, reserve, air national
guard, civilian or contractor who is responsible for uploading content to an official use USAF
website via a Content Management System. This includes content providers who have no ability
to modify the layout, but only contribute photos and articles.
Content Management System—The software application used to upload, edit, and manage
content displayed on an AF public or private website.
Developer—The company or persons responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure
of a content management system for public websites for the USAF. This includes any person
responsible for building USAF websites.
Electronic and Information Technology (E&IT)— Includes IT and any equipment, or
interconnected system of equipment used in the creation, conversion, or duplication of data or
information. The term E&IT includes, but is not limited to, telecommunications products (such
as telephones), information kiosks, and transaction machines. IT does not include any equipment
that contains embedded IT used as an integral part of the product, but whose principal function is
not the acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching,
interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information (29 USC § 794d). Section
508(a)(5) and The Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards of the U.S.
Access Board specifically exclude National Security Systems (as defined in 40 USC § 11103(a))
from the requirements of Section 508. (29 USC § 794d(a)(5))”.
AFI33-393 10 APRIL 2013                                                                         9


Information Technology (IT)—Any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of
equipment used in the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement,
control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information. This
includes equipment used by the executive agency directly or used by a contractor under a
contract with the executive agency, which (i) requires the use of such equipment, or (ii) requires
the use, to a significant extent, of such equipment in the performance of a service or the
furnishing of a product. The term “IT” includes computers, ancillary equipment, software,
firmware, and similar procedures, services (including support services), and related resources.
Notwithstanding the preceding, the term "IT” does not include any equipment that is required by
a federal contractor incident to a federal contract. The term “IT” includes National Security
Systems (NSS), and is synonymous with the term "information system" (IS). (DoDD 4630.5,
DoDD 8000.1, 40 USC § 11101(6))
Market research—The process of collecting and analyzing information about the market’s
capability to satisfy a specified need.
Metadata—Metadata describes other data. It provides information about a certain item’s
content. Web pages often include metadata in the form of meta tags. Description and keywords
meta tags are commonly used to describe the Web page’s content. Most search engines use this
data when adding pages to their search index.
Meta Tag—This is a special HTML tag that is used to store information about a Web page but is
not displayed in a Web browser. For example, meta tags provide information such as what
program was used to create the page, a description of the page, and keywords that are relevant to
the page. Many search engines use the information stored in meta tags when they index Web
pages.
Non-Availability—Circumstances where no commercial items are available that meet the
Access Board’s applicable technical provisions (directly or through equivalent facilitation) in
time to satisfy the agency’s delivery requirements. If products are available that meet some, but
not all, applicable provisions, agencies cannot claim a product as a whole is non-available just
because it does not meet all of the applicable technical provisions.
Private Internet Service—A USAF internet service with access controls in place to limit
availability of non-public information or exchanges of non-public information to specific
