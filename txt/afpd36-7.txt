1. Policy. The United States Air Force is committed to improving workforce efficiency,
maintaining high standards of employee performance, and facilitating the amicable settlement of
employee disputes regarding their conditions of employment. It is Air Force policy to:

1.1 Notify appropriate unions concerning changes in conditions of employment affecting
bargaining unit employees, consult or negotiate in good faith as applicable, cooperate in impasse
procedures, and implement applicable Federal Labor Relations Authority decisions.

1.2 Respect employees’ right to organize, bargain collectively and participate in decisions which
affect them through labor organizations of their own choosing.

1.3 Train management officials and supervisors in labor-management and employee relations.

1.4 Ensure applicants and employees are suitable for initial and continued employment.
Employees will be made aware of standards of conduct and shall comply with those standards.

1.5 Maintain a constructive, disciplined work environment in which both management and
employees recognize and carry out their responsibilities. The Air Force shall take disciplinary
and adverse actions only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the Service.

1.6 Ensure disciplinary and adverse actions are taken without unlawful discrimination because
of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, marital status, disability, political affiliation,
sexual orientation, reprisal or other nonmerit factors. The Air Force must provide a workplace
free of sexual harassment for all employees.

1.7 Process fairly, impartially, and in a timely manner, lawful expressions of dissatisfaction on
matters of civilian employment. The Air Force will resolve civilian disputes as early as possible;
and ensure persons who take part in presenting or processing expressions of dissatisfaction in
approved fora are free from unlawful discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex,
national origin, age, marital status, disability, political affiliation, sexual orientation, reprisal or
other nonmerit factors.
