                                           Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope. This instruction outlines the procedures applicable to the safe operation of CAP-
USAF contract rental aircraft. This instruction prescribes standard operational procedures to be
used by all pilots operating any CAP-USAF aircraft. Units may provide local operating
procedures in a supplement to this publication.
1.2. Pilot's Responsibility. In conjunction with other governing directives, this instruction
prescribes CAP-USAF procedures under most circumstances but is not to be used as a substitute
for sound judgment or common sense. The pilot in command (PIC) is ultimately responsible for
the safe and effective operation of the aircraft and will ensure all occupants of the aircraft
comply with this directive.
1.3. Deviations. Do not deviate from the procedures and guidance in this publication except
when necessary to preserve safety or protect lives. In that case, the PIC has ultimate authority
and responsibility for the course of action to be taken and will take the appropriate action to
safely recover the aircraft. Report all deviations without waiver through channels to the
MAJCOM office of primary responsibility.
1.4. References. The primary references for CAP-USAF operations are this instruction and
either the pilot’s operating handbook (POH) or the aircraft flight manual (AFM) for the aircraft
being flown. (Note: The terms POH or AFM may be used interchangeably in this instruction.)
HQ CAP-USAF and CAP-USAF liaison regions (LR) may expand these basic procedures with
publications detailing maneuvers and instructional techniques. These publications may be used to
augment and expand qualification and continuation training but will not be less restrictive.
1.5. Recommended Changes and Waivers. Submit suggested improvements to this instruction
on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, through
standardization/evaluation channels through CAP-USAF/XO to HQ AETC/A3FV. In accordance
with (IAW) AFPD 11-2, HQ USAF/A3/5 is approval authority for changes or revisions to this
instruction. The MAJCOM director of operations (A3) is the waiver authority for this instruction.
Submit waiver requests in message or memorandum format.
1.6. Crew Requirements. The minimum crew complement for CAP-USAF aircraft is the
certified crew complement for the aircraft.
1.7. Maximum Flight Duty Period (FDP) and Flight Time. AFI 11-202, Volume 3, lists
maximum FDPs.
    1.7.1. For normal operations, consider CAP-USAF aircraft as trainer-type aircraft.
    1.7.2. Maximum FDP for training missions is 12 hours. Flight examiners administering
    evaluations will not exceed training FDP for initial and requalification evaluations and will
    not exceed two-pilot FDP for recurring evaluations.
1.8. Clothing Requirements. AFI 11-301, Volume 1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE)
Program, prescribes minimum aircrew clothing requirements. In the absence of specific
guidance:
AFI11-2CAP-USAFV3 25 DECEMBER 2009                                                           5


   1.8.1. Active duty aircrew will wear the aircrew uniform as outlined in AFI 36-2903, Dress
   and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, on all missions, unless otherwise
   authorized by the CAP-USAF commander (CC).
   1.8.2. Civil service aircrew will wear conservatively styled civilian clothing, personally
   procured flight suits, or other utility-type attire.
   1.8.3. Each unit commander will determine extra clothing to be worn or carried aboard all
   flights commensurate with mission, climate, and terrain involved.
   1.8.4. Crewmembers will remove all rings, scarves, and neckties before performing aircrew
   duties.
1.9. Seatbelts and Shoulder Harnesses:
   1.9.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seatbelt.

                                          Chapter 2

                                   MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. The individual pilots and the operations functions of the organizations
jointly share responsibility of mission planning. The PIC is ultimately responsible for mission
planning.
2.2. General Procedures. The aircrew will:
    2.2.1. Accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission accomplishment. AFI 11-
    202, Volume 3, specifies minimum requirements.
       2.2.1.1. CAP-USAF missions are conducted as official military flights and do not require
       individual civil aircraft landing permits according to AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing
       Permits. Include the remark “Air Force Contract Rental Aircraft” in the remarks section
       of the flight plan and use only the assigned CAP-USAF call sign to preclude confusion
       with CAP aircraft or civilian aircraft.
       2.2.1.2. Pilots may use Direct User Access Terminal System or Flight Star flight
       planning software.
    2.2.2. Compute takeoff and landing data for each flight. CAP-USAF/XO-approved tabulated
    data may be used when available. When aircrews use less than the entire runway for takeoff,
    base takeoff data calculations on the actual runway remaining from the point where takeoff
    starts.
    2.2.3. Ensure all passengers are manifested IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3. CAP-USAF
    passenger transportation requirements are for oversight, liaison, and assistance of the CAP.
    This provision is not intended to provide space available transportation. Passengers must be
    performing duties at the sortie destination on behalf of the CAP or CAP-USAF.
    2.2.4. Ensure all flights are authorized IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
       2.2.4.1. Designate a CAP-USAF pilot as the PIC on all flights with CAP pilots.
       Exception: Units may designate CAP pilots as the PIC when conducting initial
       qualification training, during an initial or requalification flight evaluation, and when
       observing or evaluating a CAP training mission. Note: The LR director of operations
       (LR/DO) must approve designation of other than CAP-USAF pilots as aircrew members
       on CAP-USAF flights.
       2.2.4.2. Mission-essential personnel status is not authorized on CAP-USAF contract
       rental aircraft.
    2.2.5. Ensure all flights are approved IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3. All CAP-USAF flights
    exiting or originating outside the continental United States (to include flights to or from
    Puerto Rico or Alaska) must receive prior approval from CAP-USAF/CC.
2.3. Briefings and Debriefings. The PIC is responsible for presenting a logical briefing that
will promote safe, effective mission accomplishment. All pilots will attend the flight briefing.
The PIC will structure the flight briefing to accommodate the capabilities of each pilot in the
AFI11-2CAP-USAFV3 25 DECEMBER 2009                                                                7


flight. Passengers will be briefed on their specific duties and responsibilities related to safe
mission accomplishment. All missions will be debriefed.
   2.3.1. Minimum Briefing Times. Begin briefings at least 30 minutes before the scheduled
   takeoff. On subsequent flights with the same crew on the same day, the PIC must brief only
   those items that have changed from the previous flights.
   2.3.2. Briefing Guides:
       2.3.2.1. Aircrews will refer to the appropriate briefing guides located in Attachment 2
       and Attachment 3, and brief applicable items before each mission. Note: Briefing guides
       are reference lists of items that may apply to particular missions. The flight manual
       contains the passenger briefing guide.
       2.3.2.2. Items listed may be briefed in any sequence. Those items covered by written
       standards and understood by all participants may be briefed as standard. Each guide may
       be expanded as necessary to cover other important items of the flight. Brief only those
       items applicable to the particular mission and in sufficient detail to prevent any
       misunderstanding between crewmembers.
   2.3.3. Alternate Missions. If applicable, brief an alternate mission for each flight.
2.4. Maps and Charts. A local sectional or equivalent product, appropriate visual flight rules
(VFR) terminal area charts (class B airspace), and charts covering the route of flight must be on
board the aircraft.
2.5. Required Documents and Publications. The following documents and publications must
be on board for flight:
   2.5.1. Aircraft weight and balance.
   2.5.2. Airworthiness certificate.
   2.5.3. Aircraft registration.
   2.5.4. CAP aircraft information file (CAP aircraft only).
   2.5.5. Passenger manifest, if required (according to AFI 11-202, Volume 3).
   2.5.6. An AFM or POH.
   2.5.7. A unit-developed pilot aid according to paragraph 2.6.2 of this instruction.
   2.5.8. A mission kit. CAP-USAF/XO will determine contents of mission kits.

3.1. General:
   3.1.1. Checklists:
       3.1.1.1. Aircrew will accomplish all checklists with strict discipline. A checklist is not
       complete until all items have been accomplished. Momentary hesitations for coordination
       items, air traffic control interruptions, and deviations specified in the POH, etc., are
       authorized.
       3.1.1.2. Pilots must ensure that aircraft checklists contain any new or modified operating
       procedures directed by all applicable supplemental type certificates.
   3.1.2. Communications:
       3.1.2.1. CAP-USAF/XO will designate aircraft call signs.
       3.1.2.2. In terminal areas, both pilots will monitor the primary air traffic control
       frequency.
       3.1.2.3. The pilot operating the radios will inform the other pilot when the primary radio
       is changed.
       3.1.2.4. The aircrew will limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and
       mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, and landing.
3.2. Preflight:
   3.2.1. Required Aircrew Equipment:
       3.2.1.1. A survival kit is required for all operations. CAP-USAF/XO will determine the
       minimum survival kit contents. LR/CCs may require additional items.
       3.2.1.2. An operable flashlight is required for all night operations.
   3.2.2. Aircraft Airworthiness. The PIC is responsible for ensuring the airworthiness of the
   aircraft. CAP-USAF pilots must thoroughly review any pertinent aircraft maintenance
   records prior to accepting an aircraft for flight. Pilots should be aware that aircraft rented
   from commercial sources may not be as thoroughly maintained as aircraft from CAP or Air
   Force Aero Club sources.
   3.2.3. Aircraft Systems. Chapter 4 specifies the minimum equipment required for flight.
   3.2.4. Propeller Operations. Hand-propping is prohibited. The propeller may be turned to
   facilitate ground handling provided the pilot confirms the master, magneto, and ignition
   switches are in the OFF position with the ignition key removed. This does not constitute
   “hand-propping.”
   3.2.5. External Power Starts. Use of external power for engine start with a dead battery or
   for charging a “dead” battery is prohibited. Do not accept an aircraft for flight unless the
   malfunction requiring the use of external power is determined and corrected, e.g., bad
   battery, drained battery, or other electrical malfunction. Remove the battery from the aircraft
10                                                 AFI11-2CAP-USAFV3 25 DECEMBER 2009


     for servicing. Use of external power for cold weather starting and during lengthy
     maintenance work is permitted.
     3.2.6. Instrument Cockpit Check. Complete an instrument cockpit check prior to initial
     takeoff on every sortie. Exception: An instrument cockpit check is not required when no
     instrument approaches are planned during a day local sortie. Note: LR/CCs may define local
     flying areas.
3.3. Ground and Taxi Operations:
     3.3.1. Refueling Operations. Pilots will:
        3.3.1.1. Ensure personnel not actively involved in refueling will remain at least 50 feet
        away from an aircraft refueling operation. In addition, do not operate the engine, taxi, or
        radiate electromagnetic energy within the 50-foot safety zone.
        3.3.1.2. Not refuel or service aircraft with any personnel inside the aircraft.
        3.3.1.3. Ensure all magneto switches and the master switch are in the OFF position, and
        the ignition key is removed from the switch prior to any aircraft servicing.
        3.3.1.4. Check fuel samples for impurities and proper type after every refueling and
        before the first flight of the day. Fuel should be allowed to settle for at least 30 minutes to
        obtain the most valid sampling. If the sample is bad, immediately contact local refueling
        and maintenance personnel.
        3.3.1.5. Visually check fuel quantity prior to every flight.
     3.3.2. Ground Handling and Towing. Pilots will:
        3.3.2.1. Use extreme caution when ground handling aircraft. Improper procedures may
        result in structural damage.
        3.3.2.2. Not use the empennage to ground handle or turn the aircraft.
        3.3.2.3. Review aircraft nose gear turning limits in the AFM or POH prior to towing
        operations.
     3.3.3. Foreign Object Damage. To reduce the risk of foreign object damage during ground
     operations:
        3.3.3.1. Do not allow personnel to approach an operating engine.
        3.3.3.2. Avoid using excessive power during ground operations.
        3.3.3.3. Avoid prop or jet blast from other aircraft.
        3.3.3.4. Ensure loose items are secure in the cockpit before opening the doors or
        windows.
        3.3.3.5. Ensure a minimum of 10 feet nose-to-tail separation when starting behind
        another aircraft.
     3.3.4. Aircraft Start. The PIC will:
        3.3.4.1. Ensure the area around the propeller is clear and that all passengers are properly
        seated before starting the engine.
AFI11-2CAP-USAFV3 25 DECEMBER 2009                                                              11


      3.3.4.2. Not allow an individual who is not qualified or not in training leading to
      qualification to start engines or taxi the aircraft.
      3.3.4.3. Report all engine failures or abnormalities, including the total time the engine
      ran, to the CAP-USAF flying safety officer and the aircraft owner or operator. If the
      engine stops after warmup for no apparent reason, abort the aircraft.
   3.3.5. General Taxi Restrictions and Considerations:
      3.3.5.1. Do not taxi through snowdrifts and significant accumulations of ice.
      3.3.5.2. Plan to taxi around water drains and other low spots, gravel, and puddles of
      water to lessen the chance of prop damage.
      3.3.5.3. Avoid high power settings (greater than 1,800 revolutions per minute) on the
      ground when possible.
   3.3.6. Minimum Obstacle Clearances. Comply with the minimum taxi clearances in AFI
   11-218, Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground, as supplemented.
      3.3.6.1. Taxi speed within 10 feet of an obstacle will not exceed a slow walk.
      3.3.6.2. The marshaler or wingwalker must maintain visual contact with the aircraft
      wingtips and obstacle at all times while remaining constantly visible to the pilot.
   3.3.7. Minimum Taxi Interval. Maintain at least 75 feet behind light single-engine aircraft.
   Maintain at least 200 feet behind multi-engine or small jet aircraft and 500 feet behind
   taxiing helicopters and large jet aircraft.
   3.3.8. Engine Runup. Accomplish an engine runup before every flight. During engine
   runup, the crewmember not in control of the aircraft will guard and be ready to assume
   control of the brakes in case of rudder pedal linkage failure.
3.4. Takeoff and Landing:
   3.4.1. Runway Requirements. Minimum runway length is 2,000 feet or the sum of the
   takeoff and landing rolls, whichever is greater. Pilots may accomplish intersection takeoffs
   provided the available runway length meets this requirement. Touch-and-go landings require
   a hard surfaced runway at least 3,000 feet in length or the sum of the takeoff and landing
   rolls, whichever is greater.
      3.4.1.1. Do not land over any raised web barrier. Do not roll over any cables or arresting
      gear during taxi, takeoff, or landing.
      3.4.1.2. CAP-USAF pilots may take off and land on non-hard surface runways listed in
      the US Government FLIP airport/facility directory provided the conditions in paragraph
      3.4.1 are met, and the pilot has a current flight evaluation that included soft field takeoff
      and landing.
   3.4.2. Wind Limitations. Do not takeoff, land, or taxi if the wind velocity exceeds 30
   knots. This speed restriction is reduced to 25 knots when operating on a wet runway and 15
   knots when operating on ice or snowpacked surfaces. Do not takeoff or land if the crosswind
   component exceeds the aircraft manufacturer’s maximum demonstrated crosswind velocity
   or 15 knots, whichever is less. Include maximum reported gust when determining wind
   velocity.
12                                                 AFI11-2CAP-USAFV3 25 DECEMBER 2009


     3.4.3. Raising the Landing Gear. When airborne and before moving the gear handle, the
     pilot flying the aircraft will make an advisory intercockpit “gear up” and “gear down” call
     and pause momentarily before moving the gear handle. On initial qualification training
     sorties, the instructor pilot (IP) will acknowledge “gear up” and “gear down” before the
     student moves the gear handle.
     3.4.4. Aircraft Lighting. Use all exterior lights at all times unless restricted by the POH.
     Use the landing or taxi light during all flight operations in airport traffic patterns or other
     congested airspace. If available, consider using pulsing landing light during daylight
     operations. See AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and the POH for additional guidance on aircraft
     lighting.
     3.4.5. Weather Requirements:
        3.4.5.1. For an IFR takeoff, existing weather must be at or above compatible IFR landing
        minimums at the departure airfield.
        3.4.5.2. For IFR landings, pilots will use a 200-foot ceiling and 1/2-mile visibility
        (runway visual range of 2,400 feet) or published minimums (whichever is higher) to
        determine IFR landing minimums. Exception: An IP may fly approaches to published
        approach minimums (ceiling and visibility). When an IP is at a set of controls, the crew
        may fly approaches to the IP’s minimums.
     3.4.6. Night Landings. Fly a precision approach, if available, at night or during marginal
     weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available approved instrument
     approach. During night visual meteorological conditions (VMC) if an approved instrument
     approach is not available, a visual approach may be flown. On training and evaluation flights
     at familiar fields, pilots may fly nonprecision approaches or VFR traffic patterns to
     accomplish required training and evaluations.
     3.4.7. Reduced Same-Runway Separation. All operations require full runway separation.
3.5. Fuel Requirements:
     3.5.1. Plan all missions to land with a minimum of 1 hour of usable fuel remaining
     (calculated at 75 percent power at planned cruise altitude).
     3.5.2. Initial takeoffs with less than full fuel load are permitted provided the fuel load can be
     determined by an aircraft manufacturer-approved method listed in the POH, and all other fuel
     requirements for the mission are met. This requirement may be waived by the CAP-
     USAF/XO. This restriction does not apply to en route stops or multiple sorties conducted by
     the same aircraft commander. Note: Use of aftermarket dipsticks and other fuel quantity
     indicators are prohibited.
3.6. Minimum Altitudes:
     3.6.1. Minimum en route altitude is 1,000 feet AGL.
     3.6.2. Minimum altitude during simulated off-airfield forced landings is 400 feet AGL with
     an IP on board, or 500 feet AGL without an IP on board the aircraft.
     3.6.3. Perform all portions of stalls, slow flight, steep turns, and unusual attitude recoveries
     above 1,500 feet AGL or as directed by the POH, whichever is higher.
AFI11-2CAP-USAFV3 25 DECEMBER 2009                                                              13


3.7. In-Flight Weather Requirements:
   3.7.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported freezing rain or icing is prohibited. If severe
   turbulence is reported, cease operations in the affected area. Note: Aircraft damage may
   occur 20 miles or more from any thunderstorm.
   3.7.2. Flight into areas of known or reported turbulence greater than moderate is prohibited.
   Exception: The LR/CC may approve flight into areas of forecast severe turbulence. Crews
   should use good judgment when flying into any area conducive to mountain wave turbulence
   and avoid these areas when possible.
   3.7.3. Conduct all stalls, slow flight, and unusual attitude recoveries in day VMC.
3.8. Instrument and Navigation Procedures:
   3.8.1. Global Positioning System. GPS operations are approved IAW the AFM. Refer to
   AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures.
   3.8.2. Simulated Instrument Flight:
      3.8.2.1. Current and qualified CAP pilots may act as safety observers for CAP-USAF
      pilots to practice simulated instrument approaches on CAP-USAF sorties. CAP pilots are
      authorized to perform safety observer duties if they possess a private pilot certificate with
      category and class ratings appropriate to the aircraft being flown.
      3.8.2.2. Practice instrument approaches under VFR are authorized according to AFI 11-
      202, Volume 3.
      3.8.2.3. Vision-restricting devices to simulate instrument meteorological conditions
      (IMC) are approved for use provided an instrument rated (Air Force or Federal Aviation
      Administration [FAA]) safety observer is at a set of controls. The only authorized vision-
      restricting devices are opaque-type glasses (foggles) and hoods. These devices are not
      approved for use during takeoff and must be removed at or prior to the decision height
      (DH) or missed approach point (MAP) during an approach to landing.
3.9. Passenger Transport Procedures:
   3.9.1. Only qualified and current pilots will occupy the left seat with passengers aboard the
   aircraft. Under actual instrument conditions with passengers on board, all takeoffs, initial
   climb out, and approaches will be made by the pilot in the left seat. The following maneuvers
   are prohibited with passengers on board the aircraft:
      3.9.1.1. Simulated emergency procedures.
      3.9.1.2. Intentional stalls.
      3.9.1.3. Touch-and-go landings.
   3.9.2. All passengers will be provided with a passenger briefing, hearing protection, and if
   available, a headset. Under no circumstances will a passenger be authorized to fly the
   aircraft. Passengers will not occupy the PIC seat during any phase of operation. Passengers
   may occupy seats with flight controls in aircraft designated for single-pilot operations by the
   POH.
14                                               AFI11-2CAP-USAFV3 25 DECEMBER 2009


3.10. Simulated Emergency Procedures. The PIC will ensure the preflight briefing includes
all airborne simulated emergencies. (Note: Practice no-flap landings are not emergency
procedures.)
     3.10.1. Conduct simulated emergency training only during day VMC.
     3.10.2. Do not practice simulated emergencies in-flight without an operable interphone.
     3.10.3. Do not practice compound or multiple simulated emergencies in-flight.
     3.10.4. Do not perform actual engine shutdowns.
     3.10.5. Do not practice takeoff emergency procedures below 500 feet AGL.
     3.10.6. Simulated Forced Landings (SFL) may be continued to touchdown on hard surface
     runways, and at least 3,000 feet long with an IP on board or 5,000 feet long without an IP on
     board.
3.11. Mandatory Advisory Calls. On missions crewed by more than one crewmember, the
pilot flying the aircraft should periodically announce intentions when flying departures, arrivals,
approaches, and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. Crewmembers
will announce when heading or airspeed deviations are observed or an altitude variation of 100
feet or more occurs. Mandatory advisory calls for the crewmember not flying are as follows:
(Note: Minimum descent altitude [MDA] and DH are determined using the guidance in
paragraph 3.4.5.2 of this instruction.)
     3.11.1. Nonprecision Approaches:
        3.11.1.1. "One hundred feet above” MDA.
        3.11.1.2. "“Minimums” at MDA.
        3.11.1.3. “Runway in sight” when the runway environment is in sight.
        3.11.1.4. “Go-around” at MAP if the runway environment is not in sight or if the aircraft
        is not in a safe position to land.
     3.11.2. Precision Approaches:
        3.11.2.1. "One hundred feet above DH."
        3.11.2.2. “Land” at DH if the runway environment is in sight and the aircraft is in a safe
        position to land.
        3.11.2.3. “Go-around” at DH if the runway environment is not in sight or if the aircraft is
        not in a safe position to land.
     3.11.3. Climb Out. “One hundred feet below level-off altitude.”
     3.11.4. Descent. “One hundred feet above intermediate level-off, procedure turn and final
     approach fix” altitudes.
3.12. Knock-It-Off Procedures:
     3.12.1. “Knock it off” is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers. Use
     the “Knock it off” to:
        3.12.1.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness.
AFI11-2CAP-USAFV3 25 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    15


        3.12.1.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
        3.12.1.3. Notify all crewmembers that the aircraft or crew is departing from established
        guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that another crewmember is uncomfortable with the
        developing conditions.
        3.12.1.4. Any instructions following the knock-it-off call should be directive, then
        descriptive. Example: “Knock it off. CLIMB. Altitude below minimums.”
    3.12.2. As soon as possible after a knock it off has been called, the aircrew will take the
    following actions:
        3.12.2.1. Stabilize the aircraft on a safe flight vector.
        3.12.2.2. Discuss specific concerns.
        3.12.2.3. Continue the current maneuver or take a new course of action after direction by
        the PIC. Note: The PIC is the final decision authority.
3.13. Transfer of Aircraft Control. Both pilots must know at all times who has control of the
aircraft. In all cases, the pilot assuming control of the aircraft will state, “I have the aircraft.” The
pilot relinquishing control will state, “You have the aircraft.” Once assuming control of the
aircraft, maintain control until relinquishing it as stated above.
3.14. Postflight:
    3.14.1. Pilots will lock and chock the aircraft if it will be left unattended for any period of
    time. Pilots will install an avionics lock (if available) when remaining off station overnight.
    Excep-tion: An avionics lock is not required on military installations with controlled or
    limited access parking areas or ramps.
    3.14.2. The PIC will ensure that adequate security of the aircraft is provided at all times.
    This includes ensuring responsible personnel on both military and civilian airfields are
    advised as to the length of stay and where the crew may be contacted.
    3.14.3. When not in a position to have continuous physical or visual contact with the aircraft,
    all cowlings and access panels will be properly installed and locked (where applicable) and
    all doors and windows will be closed and locked.
    3.14.4. Primary crew members will maintain control of the aircraft keys and/or combinations
    at all times when away from the aircraft.

                               OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. General. The PIC is responsible for exercising the necessary judgment to ensure no aircraft
is dispatched with multiple items inoperative that may result in an unsafe degradation and/or an
undue increase in crew workload. The PIC will consider the possibility of additional failures
during continued operation with inoperative systems or components. Missions originating from
home stations will not normally launch with a known malfunction. Any item the PIC considers
essential to mission completion will be fixed or corrected prior to flight. Consult LR supervisors
for additional guidance if necessary.
4.2. Flight Manual Precedence. These procedures do not supersede procedures contained in
the AFM.
4.3. Equipment and Systems Decision Matrix. Table 4.1 provides the PIC with the go/no-go
decision concerning the minimum operational equipment and systems considered essential for
safe flight. Refer to AFI 11-202, Volume 3, for equipment required for flight. Do not perform
functional or acceptance check flights.
4.4. Waivers. CAP-USAF/XOV may waive the requirements of Table 4.1 for an operational
necessity.
