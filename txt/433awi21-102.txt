This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and Space
Maintenance. This instruction extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101,
Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management. The instruction standardizes the procedures
for managing effective Functional Check Flight (FCF), Operation Check Flight (OCF) and High
Speed Taxi Checks. The 433rd Maintenance Group Commander (MXG/CC) and 433 Operations
Group Commander (OG/CC) have joint responsibility for the effective management of these
programs. The success of these programs begins with the cooperation between the Operations
and Maintenance communities. Quality Assurance and the Operations Group Standardization
Evaluation (OGV) will work together in the development of these programs. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the Air Force Form (AF Form) 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Form 847 from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of
command. Ensure that all records credited as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The instruction standardizes the procedures for managing effective Functional Check Flight
(FCF), Operation Check Flight (OCF) and High Speed Taxi Checks.
 2                                                        433AWI21-102 15 FEBRUARY 2012


1. General. The 433 Maintenance Group Quality Assurance (433 MXG/MXGQ) and Aircraft
Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) and/or Maintenance Squadron (MXS) superintendents will
evaluate aircraft maintenance activities to determine if a FCF, OCF or High Speed Taxi Check is
required before returning an aircraft to regular service. Aircraft recovering from cannibalization
status, isochronal inspections, and/or Contract Field Team (CFT) repair will be evaluated to
determine if an FCF, OCF or High Speed Taxi Check is required based on the type and degree of
maintenance.
2. Functional Check Flight (FCF).
     2.1. FCF’s are determined by the requirements outlined in Technical Order (T.O.). 1-1-300,
     Acceptance/Functional Check Flights and Maintenance Operational Checks, T.O. 1C-5A-6,
     Scheduled Insp, and Maint Requirements, or as directed by the 433 MXG/CC.
     2.2. The OG/CC (or equivalent) will select a qualified and thoroughly experienced
     individual to serve as FCF/OCF Officer in Charge (OIC). This OIC serves as a subject
     matter expert for FCF/OCF matters in the operations community and will interface with the
     Quality Assurance (QA) FCF Monitor in the scheduling activities of FCF’s, OCF’s and High
     Speed Taxi Checks.
     2.3. 433 Airlift Wing, Lackland Air Force Base (LAFB) Air Force Reserve Command
     (AFRC) aircrews are not currently qualified nor authorized to perform FCF’s. AFI 11-2C-
     5V3, C-5 Operations Procedures, Chapter 5 outlines the procedures that will be followed in
     the event an FCF is required. If it becomes necessary to accomplish an FCF at LAFB Texas
     (TX), the 433 MXG/CC will coordinate with the 339th Flight Test Squadron/Director
     Operations Validation (FLTS/DOV) at Robins AFB Georgia (GA).
     2.4. 433 MXGQ section and the applicable maintenance Flight Chief Superintendent will
     serve as the Point of Contact (POC) on briefing FCF aircrews on matters concerning the
     discrepancies and/or conditions prompting the necessity of the FCF. QA will ensure the
     aircraft Air Force Training Order (AFTO) Form 781, Arms Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
     Document -series forms and the aircraft primary Weight and Balance (W&B) forms are
     available for review and discussion.
     2.5. 433 MXGQ will use Quality Assurance Tracking and Trend Analysis System
     (QANTTAS) Functional Check Flight (FCF) feature to track Functional Check Flights
     (FCF’s) and Operational Check Flights (OCF’s), to provide historical information on all
     FCF’s and OCF’s.
3. Operational Check Flights (OCF).
     3.1. OCF’s are determined by the requirements contained in T.O.1C-5A-6, T.O.1C-5A-1,
     FLIGHT MANUAL and Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO). OCF’s can be
     performed by aircrews that are not FCF qualified; however, OCF’s will be flown by highly
     experienced aircrews. All OCF’s will be approved and/or directed by the 433 MXG/CC.
     Under normal circumstances, the MXG point of contact will provide 48-hour notification to
     433 Operations Support Squadron/Current Operations (OSS/OSC) to ensure aircrew
     availability.
     3.2. Coordination between the following agencies is vital to this program:
433AWI21-102 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    3


      3.2.1. QA will be the point of contact between maintenance and operations. They will
      schedule timely briefings to discuss the flight profile and operational checks required.
      3.2.2. OGV will coordinate with the 68th Airlift Squadron to provide highly qualified
      pilots, flight engineers, and all other necessary crew members to accomplish the required
      checks. As a minimum, the crew should include a highly experienced instructor or
      evaluator pilot, an instructor engineer, and a first engineer.
      3.2.3. AMXS and MXS will evaluate all aircraft and recommend whether or not an OCF
      is required before returning the aircraft to regular service. AMXS and MXS will provide
      information on all maintenance/repair actions and provide specialist representatives to
      discuss any affected systems. If an in-flight operational check of the Ram Air Turbine
      (RAT) is due, AMXS Production Supervisor and/or MXS Production Supervisor will
      coordinate with Plans and Scheduling to restrict the aircraft to local flight area pattern to
      perform this in-flight check.
      3.2.4. The MXG/CC shall determine whether an OCF should or will be requested and
      scheduled. Under circumstances other than those specified in the aircraft -6 inspection
      manual, the need for an aircraft Check Flight following maintenance or repair work is an
      engineering decision to be exercised by the commander. Such decisions will be based
      upon the scope of work accomplished and consideration of the affected components
      relative to safety of operation.
   3.3. All Cannibalization (CANN) and ISOCHRONAL (ISO) status aircraft will require a
   Safety of Flight evaluation to determine whether a FCF or OCF is appropriate or required
   before returning the aircraft to regular service. Maintenance supervision will identify to
   Quality Assurance any maintenance actions that may require an FCF/OCF (also see
   paragraph 3.2.5).
      3.3.1. Length of time in CANN and the extent to which aircraft systems were affected by
      part cannibalization are key factors when requesting a FCF or OCF.
4. In-Flight Operational Checks.
   4.1. In-Flight Operational Checks will be accomplished when test equipment does not exist
   to perform the operational check on the ground and or at the request of maintenance to
   validate a maintenance action that cannot be fully verified on the ground.
      4.1.1. In-Flight Operation Checks will be documented by maintenance stating the
      purpose and operational check required by the maintenance technical order.
      4.1.2. Maintenance will contact Quality Assurance if it has been determined that an In-
      Flight Operational Check is required. Quality Assurance will coordinate and follow the
      In-Flight Operational Check Sheet (Attachment 3) process check sheet with the
      applicable agencies.
5. High Speed Taxi-Checks.
   5.1. Only FCF crews shall perform High-Speed Taxi checks.
