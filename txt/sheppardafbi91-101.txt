This instruction implements AFPD 91-1, Nuclear Weapons and System Surety. It defines
responsibilities and establishes local procedures to identify and monitor Nuclear Certified
Equipment (NCE) and establishes local procedures for reporting suspected NCE deficiencies
(flagword) “DULL SWORD” to the Wing Safety office. It applies to all military and civilian
personnel in units that handle or maintain NCE. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) or
any updated statement provided by the AF Records Management Office (SAF/CIO A6P). Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of
command. If there is any conflict between statements in this instruction and AFRIMS regarding
retention of records, AFRIMS applies. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the OPR. The use of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial
product, commodity, or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force.

1. General. Reinvigoration of the Air Force nuclear mission is a high priority. Reporting
malfunctions, failures, and abnormalities involving Nuclear Certified Equipment (NCE) in use at
non-nuclear units is one aspect of the nuclear reinvigoration effort. The DULL SWORD nuclear
deficiency report provides a means of trend analysis to identify issues that could affect the safety
and reliability of an NCE asset for use in nuclear operations. This instruction serves to define
responsibilities and establishes local procedures to identify and monitor NCE, as well as
 2                                                      SHEPPARDAFBI91-101 4 JUNE 2014


procedures for reporting suspected NCE deficiencies to the Wing Safety office for investigation
and up-channel reporting as warranted. Furthermore when a product quality deficiency report is
submitted involving a nuclear certified asset the unit will also complete a Sheppard AFB Form
16, DULL SWORD WORKSHEET. The 82d Training Wing Safety office will determine if the
product quality deficiency also warrants DULL SWORD reporting. Tenant units on AF
installations will follow reporting guidelines IAW host installation’s Weapon Safety Office with
a courtesy message transmitted through Commander channels to the 82nd WG/CC.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. Wing Weapons Safety Manager will:
        2.1.1. Serve as the installation DULL SWORD program manager.
        2.1.2. Provide training to unit NCE monitors and perform staff assistance visits as
        requested.
        2.1.3. Verify unit NCE listings are validated semi-annually.
        2.1.4. Conduct inspection of unit NCE program in conjunction with annual safety
        inspection.
        2.1.5. Investigate and submit reportable NCE malfunctions, failures, and abnormalities to
        the Air Force Safety Center through the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS).
     2.2. Unit commanders with Nuclear Certified Equipment assigned will:
        2.2.1. Appoint primary and alternate unit NCE monitors possessing at least a 5-skill level
        to serve as liaisons to the Wing Weapons Safety office. Personnel serving as Unit
        Weapons Safety Representatives may also be designated NCE monitors at the
        commanders’ discretion.
        2.2.2. Appointees will be replaced 30 days prior to separation, PCS, or deployment in
        excess of 30 days.
        2.2.3. Ensure appointees receive initial NCE monitor training from the Wing Weapons
        Safety office within 30 days of appointment.
        2.2.4. Ensure procedures for reporting mishaps/deficiencies involving NCE are included
        in unit mishap reporting procedures.
        2.2.5. Certify semi-annual unit NCE verification listing (Attach 2).
        2.2.6. Squadrons under the command of a group in which multiple squadrons have NCE
        assigned (i.e. 82 TRG) may consolidate NCE into a single listing for certification by the
        Group Commander.
     2.3. Unit Nuclear Certified Equipment Monitors will:
        2.3.1. Identify all NCE assigned to their unit utilizing the Master Nuclear Certified
        Listing            (MNCL).          Listing            is         located           at
        https://wwwmil.nwc.kirtland.af.mil/MNCL/index.cfm.
        2.3.2. Compile unit NCE listing and submit to the owning commander for certification.
        Unit listings will be revalidated semiannually. A copy will be submitted to Wing Safety.
SHEPPARDAFBI91-101 4 JUNE 2014                                                                   3


     2.3.3. Ensure 100% of unit assigned NCE is surveyed and documented on an annual
     basis to ensure legibility of identification information (i.e., data plate, information plate,
     appropriate markings, etc.) and that the information matches the MNCL listing (this may
     be incorporated into periodic inspections). Discrepancies will be reported via command
     channels to the appropriate program office with engineering authority for the item or
