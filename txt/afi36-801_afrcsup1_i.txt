This instruction implements AFPD 36-8, Employee Benefits and Entitlements, and Department of
Defense (DoD) Instruction 1418.2, Standards for Furnishing Uniforms or Paying Uniform Allowances to
DoD Civilian Employees, 5 May 1969, by establishing standards and conditions for furnishing uniforms
or paying uniform allowances to direct hire Air Force employees paid from appropriated funds, including
United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR) and Title 5 United States Code (U.S.C.) employees of the Air
National Guard. It does not apply to employees furnished uniforms or paid uniform allowances under
other laws or regulations, such as medical and food service personnel furnished uniforms under Table of
Allowance (TA) 016, non-US citizen employees furnished uniforms or paid uniform allowances under
labor agreements concluded with another government, and persons furnished special clothing under AFM
67-1 or its implementing instructions.

protection personnel. It clarifies and modifies the requirements as appropriate to ensure the safety of fire-
fighters. The AFI is printed word-for-word without editorial review. Air Force Reserve Command sup-
plementary material is indicated by "" in boldface type. This supplement describes Air Force Reserve
Command procedures to be used in conjunction with the basic instruction. Upon receipt of this integrated
supplement discard the Air Force basic.

           WEARING OF UNIFORMS AND ESTABLISHING UNIFORM ALLOWANCES

1.1. When US Citizen Employees Wear Uniforms:
    1.1.1. US citizen employees of the Air Force must wear uniforms when:
        • Hired directly as a guard or police officer. Employees who are classified under standards who
           have primary functions in the fields of investigation and identification are excluded from
           wearing a uniform. Employees having both guard and firefighter duties wear the uniform for
           their primary assignment.
        • Employed in the Fire Protection and Prevention series, GS-081.
        • Employed as a chauffeur of vehicles assigned to the Secretary, Under Secretary, and Assistant
           Secretaries of the Air Force; Chief of Staff, Vice Chief of Staff, United States Air Force; or
           additional key officials of the Air Force as periodically designated by HQ USAF.
       •    Employed as a chauffeur or an operator of passenger vehicles. Commanders of major com-
            mands (MAJCOM) prescribe the uniform that the driver must wear.
       •    Employed as a physical education instructor at the USAF Academy Athletic Department.
       •    Assigned to 47th FTW Aircraft Maintenance, where their work makes ready-identification
            important.
       •    Hired to operate and maintain the water craft fleet assigned to the 3613th CCTS, USAF Water
            Survival School.
       •    Employed as an audio-visual equipment operator by Air University.
    1.1.2. US citizen employees of the Air Force in oversea areas (or employees being deployed to over-
    sea areas) may be required to wear uniforms if the theater or air component commanders determine
    there is an actual or threatened outbreak of hostilities, involving war, major civil disturbance (or other
    equally grave situations), or where the deployment necessitates the wearing of uniforms in specifi-
    cally defined geographic areas.
    1.1.3. Direct hire employees of the Air Force who aren't US citizens must wear uniforms when the
    oversea commander determines that the mission necessitates uniforms.
    1.1.4. Employees are not required to wear uniforms when they are appointed for 3 months or less or
    for any period of appointment, unless their work makes ready-identification important and wearing
    uniforms will accomplish that objective.

1.2. Responsibilities:
    1.2.1. The HQ USAF Director of Civilian Personnel Policy and Personnel Plans or his or her desig-
    nee and the HQ USAF Office of Primary Responsibility for the occupations listed in this instruction:

           allowance.
       •   Provide the initial and replacement allowance rate, with documentation, to HQ USAF/DPC.
       •   Formulate and publish policy guidance on Air Force civilian uniform materials.

1.3. Furnishing Uniforms:
    1.3.1. The Air Force must either furnish a uniform or provide a uniform allowance to all civilian
    employees required to wear uniforms. When giving an employee a rented or purchased uniform, be
    sure that the cost doesn't exceed the actual cost of the uniform or the maximum uniform allowance,
    whichever is less.
    1.3.2. Civilian employees normally must clean or launder their uniforms at their own expense.
    1.3.3. Procure uniforms locally in accordance with established AF supply procedures.
    1.3.4. When renting uniforms, account for and process the rental in the same way as other contractual
    services.

1.4. Establishing Uniform Allowances. A uniform allowance helps the employee pay for the uniform.
It must not exceed the maximum authorized under 10 U.S.C. 1593. The Air Force does not categorize
uniform allowances paid under this instruction as pay, salary, or compensation.
    1.4.1. To establish an allowance, consider the quality of each uniform item that the employee needs to
    maintain a satisfactory standard of appearance. Base the initial allowance on the costs of the items
    that make up the required uniform, but be sure you don't exceed the maximum allowance limitation.
       1.4.1.1. The initial allowance is effective as of the date an employee must first wear a uniform and
       covers a 1-year period from that date. Don't give the initial allowance to any employee or former
       employee who leaves a position before getting an authorized uniform allowance.
    1.4.2. A replacement allowance reimburses employees for those uniform items that need replacement
    because of damage or wear. Local activities establish wearout periods for replacing uniforms, but the
    minimum period is 1 year.
    EXCEPTION: Damage to clothing items beyond acceptable appearance standards qualifies for a
    replacement allowance.
       1.4.2.1. When establishing wearout periods, consider such factors as these: environment (heat
       and cold); the likelihood that some items wear out sooner (for example, coat, hat, trousers); sea-
       sons (winter, summer); flame retardancy, and so on.
       1.4.2.2. Set the replacement allowance to take into account locality, environment, amount of
       expense and frequency of replacement.
       1.4.2.3. Provide the replacement allowance on an annual or quarterly basis. Be sure to pay it in
       full before the wearout period.
    1.4.3. Authorize an annual allowance only for an employee who has the same uniform requirements
    throughout the year. If an activity has provided an annual allowance and the employee leaves a job
    requiring the wearing of the same uniform, the employee may keep one-fourth of the payment for
AFI36-801/AFRCSUP1 30 June 1995                                                                          9

   each quarter or portion of a quarter the employee held the job. The employee must return the balance
   of the annual payment.
      1.4.3.1. When employees are on extended leave, with or without pay, at the time a replacement
      allowance is due (quarterly or annual), and the supervisor has good reason to expect that the
      employee will not return to work for at least 30 calendar days into the period, withhold the
      replacement allowance.
      1.4.3.2. Employees who resume their position before the end of the quarter are entitled to the
      replacement allowance for the quarter.
      1.4.3.3. Employees who receive a replacement allowance on an annual basis don't receive pay-
      ments until they return to work. Their new annual payment cycle begins on that date.
      1.4.3.4. Employees given quarterly replacement allowances, who leave before the period of ser-
      vice involved expires, don't have to pay back the uniform allowance.
   1.4.4. Commanders determine the amounts of uniform allowances for eligible temporary employees.
   The commander's principle criteria are the employee's job requirements and the nature of the tempo-
   rary employment. Allowances for temporary employees to should be kept to a minimum.

1.5. Uniform Allowances for Reemployed or Transferred Employees:
   1.5.1. Transferred or rehired employees don't receive a new allowance for identical uniform require-
   ments if it overlaps a period for which the employee was paid an initial or replacement allowance.
   1.5.2. Employees transferred to or rehired in a position different from the one they left may receive an
   initial uniform allowance.
      1.5.2.1. Employees who leave a position and are later rehired in or transferred to a position with
      identical or similar uniform requirements may receive an initial uniform allowance if at least 1 full
      year has passed since the end of the period covered by the last allowance payment.

        ers.
    • Safety clothing such as safety shoes and asbestos gloves.
    • Shoes and socks that employees may wear as items of civilian dress during off-duty hours.
    • Shirts that employees normally wear under a uniform coat or blouse.

     2.3.1. Employees must keep all uniform items clean and neat and must replace items that are no
     longer serviceable. Employees normally pay their own cleaning and laundering expenses.
     2.3.2. Local management decides when employees must replace uniform items.

2.4. Changes in Uniform Items. Functional experts decide when to make changes to civilian uniforms.
They issue policy letters notifying installations of any changes to this instruction. The policy letter
includes the implementation dates for the new uniform, a detailed description of the uniform's material
and accessories, and other pertinent facts needed by the supervisor and employee to implement the policy.
The policy letter is an extension of this instruction and carries the same authority.
     2.4.1. When the Air Force revises civilian uniform items or specifications, employees subject to the
     new requirements may continue to wear their current uniform if it doesn't pose a safety risk or hazard
     to the employee.
     2.4.2. Supervisors must ensure that when employees purchase replacement items, the items meet the
     new requirements.

2.5. Standards of Appearance. Employees required to wear uniforms must:
    • Maintain a high standard of personal and uniform appearance.
    • Keep uniforms neat, clean, pressed, serviceable, and presentable at all times.
    • Not wear faded, frayed, or torn uniforms.
     2.5.1. Commanders may prescribe standards of appearance to ensure that all employees meet
     job-related mission and safety requirements.

     employees. Firefighters may wear mustaches but otherwise must remain clean-shaven. The mus-
     tache must not extend more than 1 inch below or 1 inch beyond the line of an individual's upper lip
     or edge of mouth, and must not interfere with the seal of the self-contained breathing apparatus.
