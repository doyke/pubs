9B25.4. Customer Service Section uses Automated R01, Priority Requirements Action List to review sta-
tus.
9B28.2. The Aircraft Parts Store processes backorder using Transaction Exception Code (TEX) M. The
Aircraft Parts Store then faxes the A0A to the Fabrication Processing Section for all Mission Capable
(MICAP) requirements. For all other backorders, the Aircraft Parts Store distributes DD Form 1348-1A,
Shipping, Issue and Due Out Release Document, to the Customer Service Section who then forwards the
A0A to the Fabrication Processing Section.
9B28.2.1. The Customer Service Section processes changes to the nomenclature field if necessary.
9B28.3.2. The Fabrication Processing Section faxes completed DD Form 1348-1A for MICAP require-
ments to the Receiving Section for receipt processing. All other DD Form 1348-1A will be picked up by
the Flight Service Center with property on their daily run and forwarded to the Receiving Section for
receipt processing.
9D1.8. To preclude unnecessary cancellations, the Customer Service Section will review the R01 for
locally manufactured items daily. Any locally manufactured requirement with no status will be followed
up manually to Fabrication Processing within seven work days.
9G1.3. Document Control Action. The Document Control uses Smart Card technology for electronic sig-
nature and filing of Standard Base Supply (SBSS) documents. This technology interfaces with the Stan-
dard Asset Tracker System (SATS) which does not create a document control record for REC documents.
The Customer Service Section will assume the responsibility to check each entry on the TAR Listing
against the receipt suspense and completed files to determine if the shipment has been received. For items
received Customer Service will annotate listing with RECEIVED or IN FILE and applicable dates. This
will eliminate suspense of two workdays for Document Control to work listing.
