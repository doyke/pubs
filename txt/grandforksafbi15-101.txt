                                         Chapter 1

                               GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General Services. The 319th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (319
OSS/OSW) provides or arranges for weather support to the 319th Air Base Wing (319 ABW)
and tenant units assigned to Grand Forks AFB (GFAFB) when in garrison or
deployed/repositioned worldwide. Weather products are tailored to meet criteria important to
flying operations, base support agencies, and maintenance operations. This instruction
establishes local weather support requirements and procedures. Agencies requiring routine
weather support not included herein should contact the 319 OSS/OSW to arrange for and
document routine weather support requirements. The remainder of this document refers to the
319 OSS/OSW as the Weather Flight or "WF." The WF is equipped with an Automated
Meteorological Observing System (AMOS) which is a certified, Air Force owned, and accredited
observing system. This system has the capability to automatically collect and disseminate
weather observations.
1.2. Location and Hours of Operation. The WF is located in Building 528 and provides or
arranges for weather support. The WF is open daily from 0600L to 2300L Monday through
Friday (except federal holidays). WF services include: weather observations, issuing observed
warnings and advisories, Mission Execution Forecasts (MEFs) and tailored weather support for
local GFAFB and worldwide operations. A duty forecaster can be reached at DSN 362-4396
during operating hours.
1.3. OWS Weather Support. WF forecasters work as a team with the 15th Operational
Weather Squadron (15 OWS) located at Scott AFB to provide weather services and resource
protection for GFAFB. Guidelines for this team support are outlined in the 319 OSS – 15 OWS
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). A 15 OWS forecaster can be reached at DSN: 576-9740.
   1.3.1. In general the 15 OWS provides GFAFB with Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs)
   and forecast weather watches, warnings and advisories 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The
   WF will amend the forecast and issue all weather watches, warnings and advisories when
   weather threatens life or property and the 15 OWS is unable to issue the information.
   1.3.2. In the event that 15 OWS operations are impaired due to lost communications, system
   failure or other issues at Scott AFB, the WF will assume responsibility for providing all
   weather support to GFAFB. The WF will retain responsibility for all products until the 15
   OWS is ready to resume its weather responsibilities role for the 319 ABW. See AFMAN 15-
   129, Aerospace Weather Operations - Processes and Procedures, and current 319 OSS – 15
   OWS MOA.
1.4. Airfield Closures and Standby Support. The WF may initiate standby operations and
suspend local weather services during airfield closure periods upon the 319th OSS commander’s
approval. During WF standby operations, the 15 OWS continues to issue forecast and weather
watches, warnings, and advisories IAW the 319 OSS – 15 OWS MOA. The AMOS will
continue to record and disseminate hourly and special observations as required per AFMAN 15-
111 and this document. WF technicians will be recalled to provide augmentation as outlined in
chapter 2.

1.5. Concept of Operations and Routine Support. The WF, in conjunction with the 15 OWS,
provides weather information to all supported agencies for operational and decision-making
purposes, as well as for the protection of base resources. The WF tailors weather information to
the specific mission requirements of supported agencies. The WF provides weather services for
military, military-related use, or tenant units only. This support mainly consists of:
     1.5.1. Airfield Services/Mission Weather Operations
          1.5.1.1. Forecasts and observations made and transmitted for local and worldwide use.
          1.5.1.2. Aircrew weather briefings to transient aircrews.
          1.5.1.3. Weather Watches, Warnings and Advisories.
          1.5.1.4. Space weather impacts
     1.5.2. Staff Meteorological Functions.
          1.5.2.1. Emergency/Crisis Action Team (CAT) briefings as requested.
          1.5.2.2. Non-routine support including, climatology briefings and special mission
          briefings.
          1.5.2.3. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) briefings as required upon advance
          coordination by local flying units.
          1.5.2.4. Other special briefings and data required by supported units upon request as
          manning allows.
1.6. Weather Flight Duty Priorities. Due to limited resources and manning, the WF must
prioritize duties. The duty forecaster will take ORM principles in consideration when complying
with the priorities in table 1.1., especially where there is imminent danger to life and/or property.

1.7. Limitations. The WF requires access to communications systems to receive and transmit
data. Current weather systems which rely on base communications systems include: Joint
Environmental Toolkit (JET), AN/FMQ-19 (AMOS) interface, Local Area Networks (LAN) at
Grand Forks and Scott AFB, PMSV radio, and various telephone services including the Defense
Switching Network (DSN), Secure Internet Protocol Routing Network (SIPRNET) and Non-
secure Internet Protocol Routing Network (NIPRNET). The AMOS also has certain limitations
on data acquisition and reliability and will require augmentation/back-up as identified in
AFMAN 15-111, Ch. 3.
   1.7.1. Local Area Network (LAN) Interruptions. The LAN provides internet connectivity
   between the WF and 15 OWS weather forecast products; connectivity between the WF and
   local units using JET (i.e. Integrated Weather Warning Capability [IWWC]) software for
   watch, warning and advisory notification and GFAFB observations and forecasts; and
   provides the WF access to radar and other data essential to weather operations. The LAN
   network is vital to the timely execution of mission weather services and airfield resource
   protection to GFAFB. Interruption of LAN service to the WF severely degrades the WF’s
   ability to support base operations to include, but not limited to: aircrew mission weather
   briefings or weather watch, warning and advisory dissemination to wing agencies, and all
   lightning data.
   1.7.2. Back-up Capability. WF capability is diminished by communication system failures.
   Back-up procedures utilize tactical meteorological equipment, and rely on the 15 OWS for
   complete communication failures.
   1.7.3. Equipment Limitations. See section 2.5. Also reference Section 2.10 for Pilot-To-
   METRO-Service (PMSV) and Section 4.1.2 for National Lightning Data.
   1.7.4. Duty limitations/priorities. Reference Sections 2.3 and 1.6.
   1.7.5. Observing Limitations. Reference Sections 2.5 and 2.6.
1.8. Release of Weather Information, Civilian Contractors and Legal Claims. Support to
non-DOD agencies and the general public will be provided after the 319 ABW Public Affairs
office has granted permission or a LOA/HTSA is in effect. Deviations are authorized only in the
event of imminent danger to life and/or property is involved. The local National Weather
Service (NWS) office is responsible for service to civilians and non-military agencies. The WF
may provide Military Support to Civil Authorities upon proper coordination.
   1.8.1. Support to Civilian Contractors. The WF can provide or arrange for day-to-day
   weather support to civilian contractors who request weather information to support
   government-funded on-base projects.
 8                                       GRANDFORKSAFBI15-101 27 DECEMBER 2011


     1.8.2. Legal Claims. The WF will honor requests for weather information for use in legal
     claims actions against the government after receiving approval from 319 ABW Judge
     Advocate office.
1.9. Evacuation and Relocation. In the event of an evacuation of the WF in building 528, WF
personnel will take appropriate measures to establish alternate airfield weather services. The
minimum requirements for any alternate site are availability of power, telephone, and PC with
base LAN connectivity. The relocation site must be within two statute miles of the center of the
runway. See section 2.7 for details regarding the WF's standard relocation site.
     1.9.1. The WF will not be evacuated during exercises. The WF may be evacuated due to a
     real-world natural disaster, bomb threat, fire, etc.
1.10. Changes to this Base Instruction. To request changes to this base instruction, contact the
WF at 747-4371/4366/4396 or send written requests/inquiries to: 319 OSS/OSW, 695 Steen
Avenue, Suite 117, Grand Forks AFB, ND 58205-6244.

                                           Chapter 2

                                    AIRFIELD SERVICES

2.1. General Airfield Services. The AMOS will be operated in full automated mode to provide
the official METAR and SPECI observations except under conditions outlined in para 2.4. The
weather technician will relay all pertinent information, such as changing weather conditions, to
the 15 OWS as part of the ―eyes forward‖ function. Weather technicians augment observations
IAW AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations and AFMAN 15-129, Aerospace Weather
Operations-Processes and Procedures, while the airfield is open and the FMQ-19 is operational.
When Air Traffic Control (ATC) operations close and the WF is in standby mode of operation
(Section 1.4), the current airfield Notice to Airman (NOTAM) will correctly reflect that
observations are automated and that PMSV services are unavailable.
2.2. Points of Observation. Weather observation data from the AMOS is collected from the
sensors on the runway; the AMOS primary sensor group location is the official point of
observation. If the AMOS is inoperative (i.e. augmented), the official point of observation is the
eastern threshold of the red carpet located west of building 528.
2.3. Weather Observations. All Surface Weather Observations, AFMAN 15-129, Aerospace
Weather Operations-Processes and Procedures. See Attachment 3 for observed elements. All
observations will be taken using the AMOS unless the system is inoperative altogether (i.e.
communication failure) or in part (i.e. sensor failure). Observations will be transmitted over the
JET automated dissemination system (ADS) hourly and whenever SPECI criteria dictate. See
Attachment 4, Tables A4.4 and A4.5.
2.4. Augmentation of Primary Observation Equipment. Augmentation is the process of the
weather technicians to manually add or edit data to an observation generated by the AMOS. The
two processes of augmentation are supplementing and back-up IAW AFMAN 15-111, Surface
Weather Observations, Chapter 3. While augmenting the AMOS, WF technicians must maintain
situational awareness of current weather conditions and AMOS observations.
   2.4.1. Supplementing is a method of manually adding meteorological information to an
   automated observation that is beyond the capabilities of the AMOS to detect and/or report.
   Supplementation of the AMOS by a certified weather technician is mandatory when any of
   the criteria are met in AFMAN 15-111, Table 3.1.:

Table 2.1. Summary of GFAFB Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions
             Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions – Body of Report
Tornado (+FC) (Note 2) (Note 3)

 10                                       GRANDFORKSAFBI15-101 27 DECEMBER 2011


      1. References for coding of augmentable weather conditions are located in Chapter 13 of
         AFMAN 15-111.
      2. The immediate reporting of funnel clouds takes precedence over any other phenomena.
      3. Log on to AMOS and be prepared to supplement for tornadic activity anytime a weather
         Watch or Warning has been issued for the phenomena.
      4. All remarks and Additive Data references are provided in Attach 3 of AFMAN 15-111.
   2.4.2. Back-up is the method of manually providing meteorological data and/or
   dissemination of an AMOS observation when the primary automated method is not
   operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure when the WF is open.
   2.4.3. For augmentation (including back-up and supplementation) of the AMOS, the official
   point of observation is the eastern threshold of the red carpet located west of building 528.
   2.4.4. Augmentation Observation Limitations. The following affects surface observation
   quality at the primary observation point.
      2.4.4.1. Buildings obscure the horizon from northeast to southwest of the observation
      point, and significantly restricts the observers view of weather phenomenon both on the
      surface and aloft. The observer relies on ATC personnel to alert them of significant
      weather phenomenon in these directions per the Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW)
      MOA.
      2.4.4.2. After significant snowfalls, drifts or piles of snow, from runway or taxiway snow
      removal operations, may obstruct vision.
2.5. Continuous Weather Watch (CWW). A CWW is the process by which the weather is
continuously monitored. The AMOS performs an automatic CWW.
   2.5.1. Weather technicians perform a Basic Weather Watch (BWW) when AMOS
   augmentation is required. During a BWW, weather technicians will recheck weather
   conditions, at intervals not to exceed 20 minutes since the last observation/recheck, when any
   of the following conditions are observed to be occurring or are forecast to occur within 1
   hour:

Table 2.2. Increased Weather Check/Observation Frequency
                  Increase Frequency of Observation Thresholds
Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.

GRANDFORKSAFBI15-101 27 DECEMBER 2011                                                            11


2.6. Equipment Limitations. As with any AMOS, the FMQ-19 has the following inherent
limitations:
   2.6.1. Due to the limitations of the FMQ-19, augmentation will be required when it is
   necessary to manually add data to an observation that is beyond the system’s capabilities to
   sense. These augmentable parameters are listed in AFMAN 15-111, table 3.1.
   2.6.2. Cloud height and coverage are determined by laser beam ceilometers, which looks at a
   small portion of the atmosphere directly above the sensor. Using a time averaging algorithm,
   it calculates a representative sky condition for the entire celestial dome from the sample of
   the atmosphere that the sensor reports. The FMQ-19 measures cloud heights between 100
   and 25,000 feet.
   2.6.3. Visibility is determined at the sensor location, so it may not always be representative
   of the entire airfield. The FMQ-19 cannot report visibility less than 1/4 statute miles.
   2.6.4. The FMQ-19 may not detect all thunderstorm and lightning activity and it cannot
   detect hail, volcanic ash, cloud types, or tornadic activity to include tornadoes, funnel clouds,
   and waterspouts.
   2.6.5. The FMQ-19 may be slow to report accurate sky conditions, visibility, and present
   weather during periods of rapidly changing weather conditions due to the time it takes to
   process its algorithms.
   2.6.6. During events in which snow falls horizontally, Runway Visual Range (RVR) values
   may become unreliable. This is due to snow accumulating on the lenses of the RVR
   equipment. Every effort will be made to correct this problem in a timely manner; however,
   safety, manning constraints, and duty priorities of weather maintenance personnel may delay
   any corrective action.
   2.6.7. Events involving high winds during snowfall may result in inaccurate snowfall
   measurements due to drifting. During this type of condition, weather technicians will derive
   estimated snowfall measurements by using a combination of the average measurement of
   snow on the ground from several points along with the liquid water collected in the
   precipitation gauge and temperature relationship.
   2.6.8. In the event a weather sensor malfunctions during hazardous weather, maintenance
   personnel will assess weather and safety concerns along with current flying operations before
   attempting repair actions. This may result in significant delays in the repair actions and
   impact the accuracy of weather products dependent on that equipment. See Attachment 7 for
   equipment maintenance priorities.
   2.6.9. Weather sensor outages. In the event of weather sensor(s) outages, WF personnel will
   revert to using tactical systems to observe conditions for dissemination to 319 ABW
   customers. Tactical systems and manual data collection require more time to create and
   disseminate an observation, hence delays in other services i.e. see duty priorities Table 1.1.
   2.6.10. The wind sensors may become inoperable during winds in excess of 99 knots or
   during heavy rain events (i.e. rain rate of 0.13 inches per hour or greater).
2.7. Alternate Operating Location (AOL). During an evacuation of the WF, the weather
technician will relocate to the south end of building 541, the ground safety office. The telephone
number for the AOL is DSN 362-7237. Additionally, telephone numbers DSN 362-
 12                                        GRANDFORKSAFBI15-101 27 DECEMBER 2011


4396/4371/4366 work at the AOL site. Observations will be disseminated over JET hourly and
when SPECI criteria dictate. If this location is unavailable, use a site that meets requirements
outlined in Section 1.9.
   2.7.1. Airfield sensors and JET operations. The weather technician will monitor AMOS
   observations using JET when access to the LAN is available and the AMOS is fully
   operational. Dissemination of observations and advisories will also be accomplished using
   JET. Forecasts, watches and warnings will continue to be disseminated by 15 OWS using
   JET.
       2.7.2. When the AMOS is not operational, the weather technician will use back-up
       equipment to augment any airfield sensor data not available and use JET to disseminate.
       If the AMOS and JET are not operational, the weather technician will use back-up
       equipment to augment sensor data and use an alternate dissemination source (such as
       JAAWIN). If JET and LAN connection unavailable at AOL, the WF will call the 15
       OWS with the required observations and the 15 OWS will then enter the observations for
       longline dissemination.
       2.7.3. In the event the AMOS, JET, LAN connection and 15 OWS are not operational,
       the weather technician will take observations using back-up equipment and will make
       every attempt to contact another CONUS WF (such as Minot AFB) to disseminate the
       GFAFB observation longline. Local back-up dissemination is outlined in Section 1.7.
2.8. Cooperative Weather Watch. Qualified non-weather personnel assist weather technicians
in monitoring the weather conditions at GFAFB by using a Cooperative Weather Watch. This
process is primarily concerned with reports of tower visibility different from the prevailing
surface visibility, local PIREPs, and any occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions
that could affect flight safety or be critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations
and resources.
   2.8.1. ATC personnel will:
       2.8.1.1. notify the Weather Flight of any occurrence of previously unreported weather
       condition(s) which could affect flight safety or which could be critical to the safety or
       efficiency of either local operations or resources. ATC personnel who are certified to
       evaluate tower visibility will report changes in tower prevailing visibility and sector
       visibility to the Weather Flight when tower visibility is less than four (4) statute miles
       and is different from surface prevailing visibility, and reporting sector visibility.
       2.8.1.2. Tower Visibility is no longer included in the official observation. ATC
       personnel may relay the Tower Visibility to aircrew if determined to affect flight safety.
       2.8.1.3. Solicit aircrews for PIREPs and relay information to the Weather Flight within 5
       minutes, or as soon as possible, after receipt for dissemination.
   2.8.2. WF personnel will:
       2.8.2.1. Weather Flight personnel will provide initial visibility observation training and
       certification for ATC as duties permit IAW AFI 13-203, Air Traffic Control, AFMAN
       15-111, Surface Weather Observations, and FAA Order 7110.65.
   2.8.3. If the ATC reports conditions differing from the official report weather personnel will
   verify the accuracy of the Automated Observing Equipment.
GRANDFORKSAFBI15-101 27 DECEMBER 2011                                                        13


   2.8.4. If determined to be inaccurate log equipment outage and notify airfield systems. Start
   backing up observation.
       2.8.4.1. Generate a SPECI observation if conditions have crossed SPECI criteria
       thresholds.
       2.8.4.2. Include the differing conditions in the next METAR if conditions alone do not
       warrant immediate dissemination.
   2.8.5. If the Automated Observing Equipment is determined to be reporting accurately,
   Weather Flight personnel will contact ATC personnel and let them know a SPECI
   observation cannot be input.
   2.8.6. As part of the cooperative weather watch, if continuous RVR reporting is needed
   during airfield closure hours, the WF will coordinate with the 319 OSS/OSAB (ATC
   personnel) to keep the runway lighting system operational. This will allow the AMOS to
   keep reporting RVR data in support of potential emergency aircraft diverts.
2.9. Highway Advisory Radio System (HARS). The WF updates HARS with a recording of
forecast weather for GFAFB on AM1610. The recording is updated two to three times daily
during WF operating hours when new forecasts are issued by the OWS; time permitting the
recording is updated when the forecast is amended. The information is intended for non-
operational use only and provides agencies and individuals the opportunity to monitor weather of
interest to them. Warnings, watches, and advisories will be updated as time permits.
2.10. Pilot-To-METRO-Service (PMSV). The WF continuously monitors UHF 343.5 MHz to
provide weather data to aircraft (either airborne or on the ground). The range is approximately
200 nautical miles (NM) at normal operating altitudes. The WF will solicit aircrews to provide
PIREPs of weather conditions over this frequency. ATC/RAPCON and Command Post
personnel will relay all PIREPs and pertinent weather information to the weather technician for
input into worldwide weather systems.
   2.10.1. WF Closure Periods. PMSV service will not be available when the WF is closed.
   Weather station closure periods and unavailability of PMSV will be listed in current airfield
   NOTAM as applicable.
   2.10.2. Short-Term Outages. WF personnel will notify ATC of any PMSV outage and
   expected time of return to service. Aircrews will be briefed on PMSV outages during their
   flight weather MEF brief. ATC will monitor UHF 343.5 MHz and advise aircrew attempting
   to contact METRO to contact Base Operation's Pilot-to-Dispatch on VHF 372.2 for
   METRO/weather service as time and resources permit. During PMSV outages aircrews can
   also request a telephone patch through the 319 ABW/CP (frequency UHF 311.0/321.0) to the
   WF (DSN: 94-362-4396). Additional PMSV service can be obtained from Minot AFB
   Weather (5 OSS/OSW) at UHF 342.5. Aircrew should refer to Flight Information
   Handbook, Section C for other METRO stations.
   2.10.3. Long-Term PMSV Outages. For outages expected to last more than 1 day, the
   procedures outlined in paragraph 2.10.2. will be followed and additionally the outage and
   back-up procedures will be documented in the current airfield NOTAM and possibly the
   FLIP when the outage is expected to be lengthy.

2.11. PIREPS. All PIREPs received by the WF will be disseminated either over the JET system
or through a back-up source such as JAAWIN if necessary. See Attachment 4 Section A4.3 for
elements specific to PIREPs.
   2.11.1. Any base agency receiving a PIREP without the capability to disseminate it into
   weather networks shall relay it within 5 minutes of receipt to the WF for dissemination.
2.12. Toxic Corridors, Chemical and Effective Downwind Messages. IAW AFI 10-2501,
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PLANNING AND OPERATIONS and the 319 ABW EM
Plan 10-2, Appendix 4 to Annex A, upon notification of any incident that involves a toxic spill or
base emergency the WF will provide wind direction and speed along with any other required
information for toxic corridor calculations performed by 319 CES/CEX, 747-4458/3790.
Updates will be provided as required.
   2.12.1. Chemical Downwind Messages (CDM) and Effective Downwind Messages (EDM)
   are available upon request.

                             MISSION WEATHER SERVICES

3.1. General. The WF provides Mission-tailored Weather Services (MWS), Meteorological
Watch (METWATCH) and Mission Meteorological Watch (MISSIONWATCH) for all GFAFB
agencies. The WF in collaboration with the 15 OWS develops a Terminal Aerodrome Forecast
(TAF), and issues weather watches, warnings and advisories for GFAFB as conditions warrant.
3.2. Limitations.
   3.2.1. JET Operability. A JET outage impairs the ability of WF and 15 OWS to
   communicate and issue products supporting MWS. Reference Section 1.7.
   3.2.2. LAN Connectivity. Reference Section 1.7.
   3.2.3. 15 OWS Operability. Reference Section 1.3.2.
3.3. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) . The 15 OWS issues a TAF every 8 hours to cover
a 24-hour period. GFAFB TAFs are disseminated over JET at 0200Z, 1000Z, and 1800Z.
AFMAN 15-124, Meteorological Codes, AFMAN 15-129, Aerospace Weather Operations-
Processes and Procedures, AFI 15-128, Aerospace Weather Operations-Roles and
Responsibilities govern all aspects of forecasting. See section 1.3.2. for WF responsibilities
when the 15 OWS is unable to support.
   3.3.1. Forecast elements represent the most probable conditions expected during the forecast
   period and in the forecast area. Unless otherwise specified, the forecast weather elements in
   the main body of the TAF (clouds, present weather, wind, etc.) apply to the area within a 5
   statute mile radius off the center of the airfield complex. See Attachment 4 for elements
   specific to TAFs.
   3.3.2. TAFs are amended as conditions warrant. See Attachment 4, Section A4.2. for TAF
   amendment criteria.
3.4. Routine/Training Mission Execution Forecast (MEF) Products. There are several MEF
products produced by the WF for different base agencies. These MEF products provide
commanders and staff, operations, support agencies, and aircrew personnel with valuable
weather information for planning and decision making purposes. New requirements, format,
and/or changes for existing briefings should be coordinated with the WF at least 5 working days
prior to their implementation.
   3.4.1. Aircrew Flight Weather MEF Product. Weather briefings will be provided to
   aircrews IAW AFMAN 15-129, Aerospace Weather Operations-Processes and Procedures,
   using GDSS II or as a 175-1 MEF through JET. All aircrew flight weather briefings should
   have access to weather graphic products through GDSS II or JET viewable as attachments.
   Transient aircrews will have MEF product support through JET available on a walk-in basis
   and will be prioritized according to WF priorities listed in Section 1.6. If the WF is
   unavailable to support transient aircrews, computer access will be available to access the 15
   OWS transient aircrew briefing system (PGS). At a minimum, aircrew MEF briefings
   produced by the WF will include the items in table 3.1.

   3.4.2. Ground Support MEF Weather Briefings and Instructional Briefings. The WF
   provides many routine weather briefings, both in and out of the weather station. Non-routine
   briefings such as Mobility Concept, Special Missions, Instrument Refresher Course (IRC),
   pre-deployment, climatological, and Installation Control Center (ICC) briefings are
   coordinated by the requesting agency. These briefings provide commanders and staff,
   operations, and aircrew personnel with valuable weather information for planning and
   decision-making.
          3.4.2.1. Non-Routine Briefing Request Procedures. A requesting agency will provide
          the WF information on the time, location, and required content of the briefing with a
          minimum of 48 hours notice when possible. In the event that WF personnel cannot be
          reached to coordinate the required weather briefing support, contact the 319 AR/CP. The
          319 AR/CP will contact the required personnel to meet a weather support
          request/requirement.
   3.4.3. Wing Stand-up. Briefing slides are provided weekly with in-person weather
   briefings expected unless otherwise coordinated. The content of such briefings are
   established by the 319 ABW/CC, but generally consists of a broad CONUS forecast slide,
   satellite/radar composite imagery slide, a local extended outlook forecast slide, a tropical
   weather activity slide and a current/next month climatology slide.
   3.4.4. Fitness Weather. The HAWC has been provided the following link
   (https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/319oss/OSW/default.aspx) to check current and forecasted
   weather conditions for planning purposes during outdoor PT testing months.

3.5. Weather Flight's Role in Integrated Flight Management (IFM) – Missions Under
Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) Control. The weather technicians are authorized to
provide updates on departure weather only; collaboration with TACC is required on all other
subject matter. Questions about the content or completion of departure packages should be
directed to the TACC Flight Manager.
   3.5.1. Local Policy for IFM Missions. To ensure the fidelity of the centralized dispatch
   concept, a GFAFB weather technician will not make changes to IFM CMEF crew papers
   with a weather package from TACC other than updating takeoff data. However, a review of
   current/updated radar and satellite imagery can be supplied to the aircrew. The technician
   will assist the aircraft commander in contacting the TACC for assistance with their MEF
   when it appears the TACC IFM forecast (CMEF) differs from the in-station briefing data
   provided to the aircrew by the WF which would indicate the need for an updated CMEF from
   TACC. IAW AFMAN 15-129 the WF will facilitate forecast discussions between the
   aircrew and TACC to elaborate on weather impacts and/or answer aircrew questions. The
   TACC LWU is the final arbiter for weather issues involving IFM sorties/missions.
   3.5.2. Notify 618 TACC if the takeoff update includes any of the criteria listed in Table 3.4.

Table 3.2. Takeoff Updates to CMEF-Weather Criteria Requiring Notification to 618
TACC.
                                IFM Takeoff Update Thresholds
Ceiling/visibility less than or equal to 200ft/1/2sm (or other published airfield limitations)
Dry runway crosswind (predominant wind) 25kts or greater
Wet runway crosswind (predominant wind) 20kts or greater
Observed LLWS for all AMC aircraft departing KRDR (Forecast LLWS for KC-10 operations)
Predominant thunderstorms on station
Freezing precipitation
Moderate (or greater severity) turbulence/icing
Forecast or observed volcanic ash on takeoff

3.6. MISSIONWATCH. MISSIONWATCH will focus on the supported customer’s
predefined mission-limiting environmental threshold values for a specific mission. The WF
conducts MISSIONWATCH from the beginning to the end of every customer’s mission support
IAW AFMAN 15-129. Transient aircrews are the exception to this policy.
   3.6.1. Aircrew Flight Weather MEF Updates. During periods of rapidly changing
   weather conditions or for emergency situations WF personnel will make every possible
   attempt to update the affected mission's aircrew before take-off with a MEF update. In the
   event that the mission has already launched and is not responding to PMSV, the MEF
   updates will be passed to the 319 ABW/CP for HF relay to the aircrew of developing or
   occurring weather conditions that were not briefed to the aircrew and pose a hazard to flight
   safety. If the Command Post cannot contact the aircrew then the controller and forecaster
   will work together using all resources available (618 TACC, etc) to find another command

  post near the aircraft’s route who can pass an update to the aircrew on UHF 311.0.
  Forecasters will also work with the LWU for relay of significant weather information via the
  LWU’s C2 resources when it appears 319 ABW aircraft have already switched off UHF
  311.0.
     3.6.1.1. Amendment Criteria: Currently there is no flying mission at Grand Forks AFB
     and no MEF amendment criteria exists.
     3.6.1.2. Amendment Dissemination: Currently there is no flying mission at Grand Forks
     AFB and no need to disseminate MEF amendments.
  3.6.2. Ground Support MEF Mission Watch. During periods of rapidly changing weather
  conditions, or for emergency situations, WF personnel will make every possible attempt to
  update the supported agency with the MEF update. In the event that the agency cannot be
  reached and an emergency situation is apparent, MEF updates will be passed to the 319
  ABW/CP for radio relay.
GRANDFORKSAFBI15-101 27 DECEMBER 2011                                                         19


                                          Chapter 4

          WEATHER WATCHES, WARNINGS AND ADVISORIES (WWAS)

4.1. General. The 15 OWS and the WF issue weather WWAs for GFAFB when conditions
warrant. All WWAs are issued and disseminated through the IWWC system via JET. The term
―base‖ is defined as an area 5 nautical miles in radius centered on the GFAFB runway complex.
Weather watches and warnings for the base will be issued 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The
WF will coordinate all requirements for and ensure timely issuance of weather watches and
warnings in accordance with AFMAN 15-129, Aerospace Weather Operations-Processes and
Procedures. Attachment 7 of this document is a comprehensive response matrix for WF
customers, which includes a comprehensive list of offices and actions for each weather watch,
warning or advisory.
   4.1.1. Watches and Forecast Warnings. The 15 OWS issues all watches, forecast
   warnings and forecast advisories for GFAFB, generally after consultation with the duty
   forecaster at GFAFB. However, the WF may issue and supersede the 15 OWS issued
   forecast weather warnings when conditions pose a serious threat to life, property or mission
   execution and there is insufficient time to pre-coordinate the warning with the 15 OWS.
   4.1.2. The WF issues all observed warnings and observed advisories unless the airfield is
   closed and standby procedures have been preapproved, see section 1.4. Upon coordination,
   the 15 OWS can issue observed warnings and advisories so long as the national Lightning
   Data System (LDS) and AMOS are operational to provide the 15 OWS access to automated
   weather sensor output.
   4.1.3. Format. Advisories, watches, and warnings will be numbered consecutively by
   identifying the type of weather message (watch, warning, or advisory) followed by a five-
   digit number. The first two numbers indicate the current month while the second three
   numbers indicate the sequence number. For example, the message "Weather Warning 02-
   005" means the month is February (02), and this is the fifth (005) warning issued in the
   month. The message "Weather Advisory 12-013" means the month is December (12), and
   this is the thirteenth (013) advisory issued in the month.
4.2. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). The WF and 15 OWS will initiate and
maintain a heightened meteorological watch and implement Severe Weather Action Procedures
IAW AFMAN 15-129.
   4.2.1. SWAP is in place to ensure sufficient personnel are available during potential/actual
   severe weather events or during meteorological/operational events critical to mission success.
   For the purpose of these procedures, severe weather is defined as any weather phenomenon
   considered critical enough by the customer to require advance/special notice and subsequent
   actions to prevent serious injury or damage to personnel, property, or resources. It is
   imperative that timely and accurate weather watches, warnings, and advisories are
   disseminated to all Grand Forks AFB agencies to ensure personnel and resource protection.
   These procedures document a two-tier system with the 319 OSS WF and the 15 OWS
   sharing responsibilities for SWAP and resource protection.
   4.2.2. It is imperative that timely and accurate weather watches, warnings, and advisories are
   disseminated to all Grand Forks AFB agencies to ensure personnel and resource protection.
 20                                      GRANDFORKSAFBI15-101 27 DECEMBER 2011


   During SWAP activation, WF personnel will be recalled as required to efficiently handle
   forecast weather conditions and increased workload. Duty personnel will expand eyes
   forward responsibilities, supplement and/or back-up the FMQ-19 observation, enhance
   MISSIONWATCH, and increase surveillance of local and regional area conditions. The
   SWAP leader will perform OPREP reporting requirements. Specific SWAP procedures and
   reporting instructions (OPREP) are detailed in the Severe Weather Action and OPREP-3
   SOPs."
   4.2.2.1. During WF closure hours the 15 OWS is responsible for recalling the WF stand-by
   forecaster.
4.3. Weather Watch. A special notice provided to advise of the potential for weather
conditions that may pose a threat to property or life. When a weather watch is issued, customers
must take preparatory actions including reviewing applicable checklists to ensure rapid response
in the event a subsequent weather warning is issued.

Figure 4.1. Weather Watch example.




4.4. Weather Warning. A special notice provided when a weather condition is occurring or
imminent and poses a threat to property or life. When a weather warning is issued, customers
must take immediate action in accordance with their established weather checklists to safeguard
property and lives. There are two types of weather warnings: the Observed Warnings which
require no Desired Lead Time (DLT) and the Forecast Warnings which require a DLT.

Figure 4.2. Weather Warning example.




4.5. GFAFB Weather Watch and Warning Criteria. Table 4.1 outlines Watches and
Warnings issued by the 15 OWS or WF for GFAFB. See Table 4.2 to weather impacts on base
activities and coordination IAW 319 ABW EM Plan 10-2.

With the exception of wind chill warnings, the weather phenomena for which watches and warnings are
issued in Table 4.1 correlate with the 319 ABW EM Plan 10-2 and are implemented whenever a watch or
warning in table 4.1 is issued.

    4.5.1. Special Rules Pertaining to Warnings. Per AFMAN 15-129, only one (1) Weather
    Warning in addition to the observed Lightning Warning can be in effect at one time. Thus,
    one warning may contain multiple criteria from table 4.1. Each agency relaying warnings
    and/or using IWWC should read and repeat each warning carefully for its effect, if any, on
    previous warnings.
GRANDFORKSAFBI15-101 27 DECEMBER 2011                                                                23


4.6. Weather Advisories. Advisories provide specific notice to an operational agency of
environmental phenomena impacting operations. Weather advisories issued to provide notice of
an event’s occurrence are known as an Observed Weather Advisory (OWA). GFAFB WF issues
OWAs. During WF closure, the 15 OWS issues all GFAFB OWAs.
    4.6.1. Advisory criteria are based on weather conditions that impact operations, sometimes
    greatly, but pose less of a threat to the general base populace than warning criteria conditions
    present. The WF forecaster always increases METWATCH when advisories are issued and
    there are no special rules on how many advisories may be in effect at one time so long as all
    notifications remain consistent. See Table 4.4. GFAFB Observed Weather Advisory Criteria.

4.7. Distribution of Weather Watches and Warnings. The WF disseminates all watches,
advisories and warnings if issued by the WF and the 15 OWS disseminates all watches, warnings
and advisories if issued by the OWS. The primary mode of dissemination from the WF to key
disseminating agencies is through JET (IWWC). Airfield Management uses the Secondary
Crash phone, when appropriate IAW 319 ABW EM Plan 10-2, as the primary means to further
disseminate the watch or warning to the 24-hour units and the trunk radio to broadcast the
notification to all its users. The Wing's Automatic Notification System (ANS) (a mass recall and
information notification system) and trunk radio is used by the Command Post to further
disseminate the watch or warning when appropriate IAW 319 ABW EM Plan 10-2, the cable
override system and base siren. At a minimum all weather watches and warnings will be
disseminated to agencies listed in Attachment 7. In the event that the ANS is inoperable, manual
notification is accomplished using the notification tree depicted in Attachment 5. Reference
 24                                        GRANDFORKSAFBI15-101 27 DECEMBER 2011


Chapter 6 for more details on back-up procedures. When the crash phone is inoperable Airfield
Management will use its back-up procedures to disseminate the watch or warning.
   4.7.1. When the WF is closed, the 15 OWS will assume responsibility to disseminate watch,
   warning and advisory information to the 319.
   4.7.2. See 319 ABW EM Plan 10-2 for additional notification and dissemination
   requirements and actions that must be taken upon receipt of certain weather watches and
   warnings. This is particularly important for Airfield Management, the Command Post and
   other units in developing dissemination checklists.
4.8. Distribution of Weather Advisories. Advisories are disseminated using JET ADS
(IWWC).
4.9. Responding to Severe Weather Events. IAW AFI 10-229, Response to Severe Weather
Events, and 319 ABW EM Plan 10-2, supported agencies will create and document severe
weather preemptive protective measures as well as severe weather post-response plans for their
operations. At a minimum, procedures developed will address:
   4.9.1. Procedures to safeguard personnel and locations to seek shelter from severe weather
   when required.
   4.9.2. Actions for safeguarding and securing aircraft, equipment, and other supplies stored
   outdoors, as required to minimize damage to Wing resources.
   4.9.3. Actions for protection of facilities.
   4.9.4. Precautions to take prior to resuming operations following a severe weather episode.

                                 RECIPROCAL SUPPORT

5.1. General. For effective weather support the WF requires reciprocal support from several
key agencies and individuals on base. Supported agencies will establish all weather support
requirements with the WF with sufficient advance notice to allow for any necessary scheduling
adjustments.
5.2. 319th Air Base Wing Command Post (319 ABW/CP). The 319 ABW/CP will:
   5.2.1. Disseminate to base agencies and general base populace all weather watches and
   warnings issued for GFAFB. When the ANS, referenced in Section 4.7, fails or is inoperable
   then disseminate all weather watches and warnings verbally via telephone. See Section 4.5
   for watches and warnings and Attachment 5 for the weather warning notification diagram.
   Language shall be read verbatim from the JET IWWC watch, warning or advisory text.
   5.2.2. Develop, maintain, and implement QRCs for additional means of notification required
   by 319 ABW EM Plan 10-2 such as siren and cable override use.
   5.2.3. Notify base agencies and general base populace of the cancellation of weather
   watches, warnings or advisories for GFAFB issued by 15 OWS or WF. See Attachment 5 for
   notification diagram.
   5.2.4. Pass to WF all PIREPs or significant weather received from airborne aircraft or
   aircraft that have recently landed see Section 2.11.
   5.2.5. Coordinate all reports involving weather, weather service, and weather equipment
   with the WF NCOIC or designated representative prior to submission. Forward a copy of any
   such report to the WF.
   5.2.6. Notify the WF if an OPREP-3 requiring weather data is being generated. Weather
   information contained within an OPREP-3 should be coordinated with WF and a copy of all

                                          Chapter 6

                         WEATHER DISSEMINATION SYSTEM

6.1. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). JET is a web-based weather data automated
dissemination system (ADS) that resides on an approved 319 ABW base LAN-PC based
computer system running the Windows NT (or newer compatible version) operating system.
Data transmitted over JET originates at the 15 OWS or WF and is sent to selected customers
throughout GFAFB.
   6.1.1. Data transmitted over JET is disseminated via the base LAN with read-only
   permissions. An end-user on the JET system has the ability to display 15 OWS and WF
   generated products.
   6.1.2. JET Operability. A JET outage impairs the WF’s and 15 OWS’s ability to
   disseminate weather information required by 319 ABW customers. In the event of an outage,
   WF will notify centralized points of contact to ensure critical information is disseminated.
6.2. JET Access. Customers desiring access to the JET website for displaying GFAFB specific
weather products must have base LAN access. Potential users must obtain a user id and
password to access the system. To set up a user account, submit an email to: ―GF Base
Weather" with name, organization, phone number in the body of the email, and type ―Request
for JET access‖ in the subject line. The request will be passed along to the JET program
managers, and they will arrange to set up the user account and give a brief demonstration to the
user. A new user must change their password immediately and every 60 days thereafter.
6.3. JET Back-up Operations. In the event that JET becomes inoperative, the duty weather
technician will activate the JET Back-up Plan. In accordance with AFMAN 15-111, Surface
Weather Observations, ATC/RAPCON elements and 319 ABW/CP will receive priority
notification.
   6.3.1. Primary JET Back-up Plan. The weather technician will contact ATC/RAPCON
   elements and 319 ABW/CP via telephone communications with required observations,
   watches, warnings and advisories until JET operability is restored. 15 OWS will be notified
   by telephone when JET is inoperable; the WF will pass observations via telephone to the 15
   OWS for input into JET. The 15 OWS will relay forecasts, watches, warnings and advisories
   to the 319 ABW/CP and the relocated weather forecaster.
   6.3.2. Communications Outage Back-up Plan. Should all telecommunications methods fail;
   runners will be used to disseminate weather information. If runners are used, weather
   information will be delivered to ATC/RAPCON and the Command Post only. All other
   agencies must arrange for pick-up of weather information.

Terms
Base—An area 5 statute miles in radius centered on building 528, Grand Forks AFB, ND.
Meteorological Watch (METWATCH)—The process of monitoring observed and forecast
weather and informing supported agencies when certain established weather conditions that
could affect their operations and/or pose a hazard to property or life occur or are expected to
occur.
Mission Watch—The WF will watch weather along routes of flight or other special interest
areas/items as required, by mutual arrangement with the supported customer.
Weather Advisory—Advisories provide specific notice to an operational agency of
environmental phenomena impacting operations. Weather advisories issued with an advance
notice requirement are known as a Forecast Weather Advisory (FWA) and advisories issued to
provide notice of an event’s occurrence are known as an Observed Weather Advisory (OWA).
Weather Watch—A special notice provided to advise of the potential for weather conditions
that may pose a hazard to property or life. When a Weather Watch is issued, customers must
take preparatory actions to ensure rapid response in the event a subsequent Weather Warning is
issued.
Weather Warning—A special notice provided when an established weather condition is
occurring or imminent and poses a hazard to property or life. When a Weather Warning is
issued, customers must take immediate action to safeguard property and lives. There are two
types of Weather Warnings–those with no Desired Lead Time (i.e., observed warnings) and
those with Desired Lead Times (i.e., forecast warnings).

                   OBSERVATION COMPONENTS AND CRITERIA

A3.1. Elements of Surface Observations.
   A3.1.1. Sky condition. Amount and height of clouds above ground level (AGL).

Table A3.1. Cloud Coverage

 Nomenclature                                    Sky coverage

 CLR (clear)                                     No clouds (below 12,000ft AGL)

 FEW (few)                                       1/8 to 2/8 of the sky covered

 SCT (scattered)                                 3/8 to 4/8 of the sky covered

 BKN (broken)                                    5/8 to 7/8 of the sky covered

 OVC (overcast)                                  covering all of the sky
   A3.1.2. Ceiling. The lowest broken or overcast layer is defined as the ceiling. When
   phenomena such as fog completely block the view of the sky, the ceiling is defined by the
   vertical visibility into the obscuration (VV). If it is partially obscured (one cannot see the
   entire horizon), sky condition will be reported and a remark will be made to show what is
   obscuring the horizon. There are two additional items that may be used to further define the
   sky condition: CB—cloud likely containing a thunderstorm; and TCU—cloud that has
   moderate vertical development which could later develop into thunderstorms and indicates
   potential turbulence.
   A3.1.3. Prevailing visibility and obstructions to vision. The prevailing visibility is the
   greatest unobstructed viewing distance over half or more of the horizon circle, not
   necessarily in contiguous sectors. The weather technician measures prevailing visibility
   using known landmarks during the day or unfocused lights of moderate intensity at night.
   Obstructions to visibility such as dust, haze, or smoke are reported whenever they reduce the
   prevailing visibility to less than seven statute miles. Precipitation is always reported when
   observed. Use the following table to interpret the observation:

   A3.1.4. Runway Visual Range (RVR). RVR is an instrumentally derived value that
   represents the horizontal distance (i.e., not slant range) an aircrew will see down the runway
   from the approach end. RVR is measured by transmissometers at both ends of the runway.
   The weather technician increases awareness of RVR values within 3 hours of a prevailing
   visibility forecast of 2 SM or less or if it is already occurring. RVR is reported when the
   prevailing visibility is less than or equal to one statute mile and/or the RVR is 6,000 feet or
   less. The lowest reported RVR is ―less than 1,000 feet‖ (M1000). If RVR sensor/system is
   inoperative on the active runway, RVR will be reported as ―RVRNO.‖ The RVR from the
   inactive end of the runway will not be reported in the event that the active end's system is
   inoperative.
   A3.1.5. Temperature and dew point are reported to the nearest degree Celsius. An ―M‖
   preceding the number indicates a negative temperature (e.g. M05 is -5C).

   A3.1.6. Winds. Reported locally to the nearest 10 degrees from magnetic north and
   transmitted worldwide in degrees from true north (the correction factor at GFAFB is zero due
   to a near zero magnetic declination) with speed in knots. The direction in degrees can be
   compared to a compass divided into 16ths with the winds coming from the direction provided
   (north winds are from 0 or 360 degrees, northeast winds are from 45 degrees, east winds are
   from 90 degrees, etc.).
   A3.1.7. Altimeter Setting (ALSTG) and Pressure Altitude (PA). Readings of current
   atmospheric pressure measured in inches of mercury and feet above standard sea level
   pressure, respectively.
   A3.1.8. Equivalent Chill Temperature (ECT). This is also known as wind chill temperature.
   To calculate ECT, the weather technician takes the current highest reported wind speed, gust
   or sustained as appropriate (2 minute average), and the outside air temperature in degrees F
   and uses a mathematical algorithm to derive the ECT.
   A3.1.9. Remarks. Remarks include distance/direction of thunderstorms, sector visibility,
   occurrence of frontal passage, or other phenomena that may serve to clarify the current
   weather conditions for transmission locally or off-base as appropriate.
   A3.1.10. Corrections. Corrections will be made anytime the observation contains an error
   and another observation has not been sent. The remark ―COR‖ will follow the time of the
   observation.

A3.2. Types of Surface Weather Observations. The following types of observations are taken
(by either the FMQ-19 or certified observer) and augmented/disseminated locally by the WF
weather technician:

    A3.2.1. Record Observation (METAR). This observation is taken 15 minutes before each
    hour and is transmitted locally 1 to 5 minutes before the hour. The following is an example:

    A3.2.2. Special Observation (SPECI). This is an observation using the same elements as
    the METAR except when a delay in reporting all elements would cause immediate threat to
    life or property, e.g., ― TORNADO SW MOV NE,‖ then a single-element SPECI will be
    taken. Below is an example of a full-element SPECI and is taken any time the weather
    technician becomes aware of significant changes in the criteria listed in table A4.4.

A3.3. Pilot Reports (PIREPs). PIREPs are reports of meteorological phenomena encountered
by aircraft in flight. They are obtained from flight crews via PMSV or relayed from the 319
ABW/CP or ATC/RAPCON. Significant PIREPs will be disseminated both locally and longline.
    A3.3.1. PIREPs will contain as a minimum the transmitting organization, entries for
    message type, location, time, flight level, type of aircraft, and at least one other element.

                        FORECAST COMPONENTS AND CRITERIA

A4.1. Elements of a Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF). A TAF contains several elements
and applies to the area within a 5 statute mile radius of the runway complex. A TAF is issued
every 8 hours and is valid for a 24-hour period. GFAFB TAF file times are 0200Z, 1000Z, and
1800Z. Each TAF must be transmitted no later than 15 minutes past the file time and will
specify the time of occurrence to the nearest hour, duration, and intensity (where applicable) of
expected weather conditions. Guidance for this product is specified in AFMAN 15-124 and
AMC supplements. See instruction at the end of this Attachment for a specific breakdown of the
TAF code. Attachment 4, Section A4.3 contains a decoding of forecast weather phenomena, as
the same codes are used to encode observations. A TAF will contain the forecast for the winds,
visibility and weather restricting that visibility, clouds to include ceilings, turbulence (to include
low-level wind shear) or icing affecting Category II aircraft (as defined in AFWA TN-98/002,
Table 2-5, Page 2-16), minimum altimeter setting, and maximum/minimum temperatures.
Forecast heights are identified in feet above ground level (AGL), as appropriate. Additionally,
each line can contain remarks to better clarify the weather forecast. The first line of every TAF
will reflect conditions at the time of transmission. A Routine Transmission Delayed (RTD)
remark will preface the file time of any scheduled TAF if the transmission is delayed beyond 15
minutes past the file time. Additional lines are required in a TAF whenever the following is
expected to occur and will be prefaced by BECMG (becoming by time specified), FM (from time
specified) or TEMPO (temporarily during time specified) remarks with the time of expected
occurrence and duration:
   A4.1.1. Wind. Speed, including gusts (encode gusts when they will exceed a mean speed of
   10 knots or more, by 5 knots or more), is forecast to be different by 10 knots or more, or the
   direction will change by more than 30 degrees when the speed (including gusts), is above 15
   knots.
   A4.1.2. Prevailing visibility. Forecast to decrease to less than or, if below, increases to equal
   or exceed 3 statute miles, 2 statute miles, or 1/2 statute mile.
   A4.1.3. Precipitation and/or thunderstorm. Forecast to begin or end.
   A4.1.4. Ceiling. Forecast to decrease to less than or, if below, increase to equal or exceed
   3,000 feet, 1,000 feet, or 200 feet.
   A4.1.5. Aircraft icing or turbulence. For Category II aircraft (the KC-135 is a Category II
   aircraft) not associated with thunderstorms, from the surface to 10,000 feet above ground
   level (AGL), onset, duration, type and intensity.
   A4.1.6. Low-level wind shear. Not associated with thunderstorms.
   A4.1.7. Maximum/minimum temperatures.
   A4.1.8. Any elements that are in a Weather Warning and can be forecast in a TAF.
   A4.1.9. Remarks: There can be remarks about any condition that in the judgment of weather
   personnel are significant to airfield operations to include those beyond 5 SM of the runway
   (surface-based partial obscurations, precipitation to west, etc.). On the last line of the TAF in
   the remarks Section, when the airfield is closed, a TAF is not required, or there are no

   operational automated sensors, the remark ―LAST NO AMDS AFT YYGG NEXT YYGG‖
   can be used where YY denotes the day of the month and GG denotes the time to the nearest
   whole hour UTC. The remark ―LIMITED METWATCH YYGG TIL YYGG‖ is used when
   an airfield is open and there is no available observation or when an airfield is closed and an
   automated sensing system is in use. Additionally, a remark to list any amendment times
   (AMD 010205 indicates an amendment at 0205Z on first day of the month) or corrections
   (COR 010205 indicates a correction at 0205Z on the first day of the month). In a corrected
   amendment, AMD COR 010205 indicates a correction to an amendment at 0205Z on the first
   day of the month.
A4.2. Forecast Amendment Criteria. Weather personnel will ensure that the TAF is always
representative of actual conditions. They will amend the TAF when the conditions described
below occur and were not forecast, or were forecast and did not occur, and the occurrence or lack
of occurrence lasts for 30 minutes or more.
   A4.2.1. Weather Warning criteria. Not in the original forecast, and the criteria have
   occurred or a Weather Warning has been issued. An amendment will also be issued when
   the criteria were included in the forecast and the Weather Warning was canceled. If the
   potential for the criteria continues to exist, the Weather Warning will remain issued and the
   TAF will not be amended unless it does not contain the criteria.
   A4.2.2. Ceiling/prevailing visibility. Decreases to less than or, if below, increases to equal
   or exceed 3,000 feet/3 statue miles, 1,000 feet/2 statute miles, or 200-feet/1/2-statue mile.
   A4.2.3. Wind. Observed winds are 10 knots different from the forecast wind speed
   (including gusts) or the wind direction changes by more than 30 degrees when the observed
   or forecast wind speed (including gusts) are expected to be over 15 knots. For a forecast
   wind of 23012G17KT, an amendment will be issued if the direction changes by more than 30
   degrees or if the sustained speeds were 2 knots (or less) or 22 knots (or more); for gusts 7
   knots (or less) or 27 knots (or more) would require an amendment.
   A4.2.4. Changes to predominant conditions. Forecast change conditions (BECMG or FM
   group) occur before the beginning of the specified period of change and are expected to
   persist. Forecast change conditions (BECMG or FM group) do not occur by the specified
   time. Forecast change conditions (BECMG or FM group) are no longer expected to occur.
   A4.2.5. Aircraft icing or turbulence (for CAT II aircraft). Beginning or ending, not
   associated with thunderstorms, from surface to 10,000 feet AGL which first meets, exceeds,
   or decreases below moderate or greater thresholds and was not specified in the forecast.
   A4.2.6. Low-level wind shear. Non-convective low-level wind shear is occurring or is
   expected to occur during the forecast period, but was not specified in the forecast; or is
   specified in the forecast, but is no longer occurring or expected to occur during the forecast
   period.
   A4.2.7. Thunderstorms. Incorrect forecast start or end time.
   A4.2.8. Representativeness. Forecast conditions are considered unrepresentative of existing
   or forecast conditions and amending the forecast improves safety, flight planning, operations
   efficiency, or assistance to in-flight aircraft.
GRANDFORKSAFBI15-101 27 DECEMBER 2011                                                                   47


    A4.2.9. Specification of temporary conditions. Forecast conditions specified as temporary
    becomes predominant (lasts for more than an hour [1 hour and 15 minutes for thunderstorms]
    and occurs 1/2 or more of the entire period) or forecast conditions specified as temporary do
    not occur as forecast or are no longer expected to occur.
