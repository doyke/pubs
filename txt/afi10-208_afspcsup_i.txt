            DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE COOP POLICY AND GUIDANCE

1.1. General. DODD 3020.26, Defense Continuity Program, defines Continuity of Operations, as an
internal effort within each Branch of Government assuring the capability exists to continue uninterrupted
essential component functions across a wide range of potential emergencies, including localized acts of
nature, accidents, and technological and/or attack-related emergencies. COOP involves continuity of
DOD mission essential functions (MEFs) through plans and capabilities governing succession of office,
emergency delegation of authority, the safekeeping of vital resources, facilities, and records, and the
improvisation or emergency acquisition of vital resources necessary for the performance of MEFs that
must be maintained at a high level of readiness, and be capable of implementing both with and without
warning.
1.1. (AFSPC) General. For AFSPC units, Mission Essential Functions (MEF) are equivalent with Mis-
sion Essential Tasks (MET). If commanders identify a function not already included in their METs, they
should coordinate a change accordingly, and incorporate that function into their COOP plan.
   1.1.1. Since the end of the cold war, and especially following the terrorist attacks of 11 September
   2001, increased potential for terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction has emphasized the need to
   ensure continuity of mission essential functions within the Air Force and the Department of Defense
   (DOD). Therefore, all organizations must be prepared to respond to a wide range of potential emer-
   gencies, including a National Security Emergency.
   1.1.2. An effective COOP program requires the existence of a command, control, communication,
   computer and information (C4I) infrastructure to direct forces or to take actions to accomplish the
   mission. In addition, it requires the appropriate personnel and data (including Intelligence Surveil-
   lance and Reconnaissance (ISR)) necessary to support command and control.
   1.1.3. COOP also requires planning for the protection of key Air Force civilian and military leaders
   and a clearly defined succession in command and/or emergency delegation of authority.

1.2. Air Force Guidance. COOP planning is simply a “good business practice”—part of the fundamen-
tal mission of all Air Force organizations.
   1.2.1. All levels of command within the Air Force will plan, budget and execute their ability to sup-
   port Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) mission essential functions and
   will assure the ability to project forces. All levels of command will ensure forces are available to the
   SECDEF to support civil authority requests for assistance and to prevent, protect against, and respond
   to threats to national security.
   1.2.2. The Air Force has a tiered response for COOP, with a focus on the most critical mission essen-
   tial functions. However, 100% of mission capability does not need to be available immediately to
   respond to an emergency. Commands, in conjunction with supported Combatant Commanders
   (COCOMS), need to determine critical capabilities, locations of highest priority, and percentage of the
   capability needed in a no warning scenario extending over a time to continue operations. In addition,
   Commands need to determine which missions enable or support critical missions and ensure an appro-
   priate level of capability is maintained over the time continuum. Supporting missions should also have
   COOP plans that reflect an acceptable level of mission resumption and/or reconstitution time.
6                                                            AFI10-208_AFSPCSUP_I 15 JULY 2008


    1.2.3. For an Air Force COOP program to succeed, all programs designed to enhance mission effec-
    tiveness must adopt a team approach to apply the appropriate capabilities and/or controls against rec-
    ognized risks. Success in meeting objectives requires a shift from risk aversion to risk management,
    and sometimes, simply accepting risk. A careful balance between mitigation of risk through effective
    integration with the critical infrastructure program (CIP), Counterterrorism, Anti-terrorism, Force
    Protection (FP), Information Assurance (IA), physical risks of the full-spectrum threat response
    (FSTR) programs and other mission continuation programs will guide Commands in developing the
    best solution for their subordinate organizations.
    1.2.3. (AFSPC) HQ AFSPC and all AFSPC Numbered Air Forces (NAF), Centers and Wings must
    develop COOP plans. AFSPC units that are tenants on non-AFSPC installations must develop COOP
    plans in coordination with the installation commander. Where AFSPC units are the host, tenant units
    must coordinate their COOP plans with the host. For geographically separated units, plans must be
    developed and provided to AFSPC parent wing/NAF (as appropriate). Copies of completed plans will
    also be forwarded to HQ AFSPC/A3 (AFSPC/A3O, Current Operations Division).
       1.2.3.1. Risk will never be zero. Therefore, Commands should apply a deliberate risk manage-
       ment process to determine which risks may be mitigated, accepted or transferred. Each Command
       must develop guidance for subordinate organizations, outlining an appropriate balance in mission
       risk. This guidance should be based on the Risk Management Process (see references) and include
       an analysis of the mission, threats and causes. It must assess the criticality of the mission, the
       degree to which mission delays can be tolerated, and the probability and severity of risks to which
       the facility, people and the infrastructure are exposed. Commands should focus risk management
       activities toward one of four options, (1) eliminate the threat, (2) eliminate the vulnerability (3)
       reduce the risk and/or (4) reduce the exposure.
           1.2.3.1.1. The Capabilities Review and Risk Assessment (CRRA) process and Concept of
           Operations (CONOPS) Champions provide an opportunity to evaluate the health and risk of
           each required capability while establishing priorities among capabilities. Commands should
           apply the CRRA construct to identify capabilities and controls necessary to ensure mission
           continuation and decrease mission risk as identified in the deliberative risk management pro-
           cess. Commands need to identify overlaps in programs providing redundant capabilities and
           prioritize support to those requirements that most successfully mitigate risk and ensure mis-
           sion continuity.
           1.2.3.1.2. There are several options available to commands to ensure COOP capability while
           maintaining fiscal accountability. These include devolution of command and control of critical
           missions to alternate locations which have the same C4 ISR capability, the creation of dual-use
           facilities based upon mission priorities, virtual C4 ISR capability through secure portals or
           routinely diversifying the mission utilizing enhance communication capability to continue
           mission integration. Commands should arrange computer and communication systems in-line
           with SAF/XC systems architecture solutions.
           1.2.3.1.3. Command senior leaders must identify critical missions, to support a coordinated
           Air Force response to a no-warning national security emergency.
       1.2.3.2. All levels of command must develop a COOP plan. These plans can be incorporated into
       other plans, such as Base Support Plans, Full-Spectrum Threat Response Plans or other plans as
       specified by the Commands. Planning factors as contained in War and Mobilization Plan Volume
AFI10-208_AFSPCSUP_I 15 JULY 2008                                                                      7


       1 (WMP-1), Basic Planning and AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2 should be included. Security classifi-
       cation and the need-to-know should be considered when determining into which plan COOP
       should be incorporated.
           1.2.3.2.1. COOP plans should evaluate and prioritize every mission performed on the installa-
           tion or within the Command with participation from the following functional offices: commu-
           nication, logistics, and command post and operations. COOP should be part of the initial risk
           assessment considered any time mission locations change and/or new construction is proposed
           to avoid unnecessary costs to rectify problems identified later. COOP plans should address the
           deliberate risk management process and include the application of controls identified to miti-
           gate risk. COOP plans should include control to mitigate CIP risk.
       1.2.3.3. COOP reconstitution should focus on recovery of the mission not necessarily recovery of
       the facility.
   1.2.4. The Homeland Security/Civil Support Division, Directorate for Strategic Security (AF/
   XOS-HC) is responsible for establishing Air Force policy for Continuity of Operations. Inherent in
   that role is the responsibility to formulate guidance for Air Force organizations to use in developing
   viable, executable COOP plans, to facilitate interagency coordination as appropriate, and to oversee
   and assess the status of COOP readiness across the Air Force.

1.3. Air Force Policy. It is Air Force policy that all Headquarters Air Force (HAF), MAJCOMs, AFRC
and ANG elements shall incorporate and institutionalize COOP concepts into relevant doctrine, policies,
strategies, programs, budgets, training, exercises and evaluation methods.
   1.3.1. The Air Force maintains continuity of operations by means of an integrated suite of programs
   designed to secure the Air Force’s warfighting capability even under attack. These programs include
   COOP, CIP, Counterterrorism, Anti-terrorism, IA, FSTR, FP and other mission assurance programs.
   The key elements necessary to maintain continuity and enhance decision-making are command and
   control, through the organization of appropriate personnel, communication and computers, and infor-
   mation.
   1.3.2. All military, civilian and assigned contractors should know what actions they should take,
   across a wide range of potential emergencies, both in-garrison and while deployed. The action may be
   as simple as go home and wait further direction or more detailed based upon their responsibilities.

                            COOP PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDANCE

2.1. COOP Planning Factors. While COOP plans cannot provide for all possible events or execution
variables, it is necessary to develop as comprehensive a plan as possible. COOP plans should address the
following planning factors and phases.
   2.1.1. COOP plans will account for both warning and no warning during duty and non-duty hour sce-
   narios.
       2.1.1.1. Throughout a buildup of alert, Force Protection Conditions (FPCON), or actual threats,
       use COOP planning elements to maintain continuity of operations, to include relocating battle
       staffs, crisis action teams, or other emergency relocation staffs.
   2.1.2. In the event of a surprise military or terrorist attack, a natural disaster, or other catastrophic
   event, initial efforts will concentrate on successor survival, devolution of command and relocation of
   key personnel, reestablishing operational and communication capabilities, and reestablishing com-
   mand and control.
       2.1.2.1. Organizations required to maintain relocation facilities must be able to sustain operations
       at alternate facilities for up to 30 days.
       2.1.2.2. Alternate facilities must be operational no later than 12 hours after activation, but more
       stringent guidelines may be outlined in the HAF COOP OPORD or unified command plans.
       2.1.2.3. Organizations should take maximum advantage of existing organizational field infra-
       structures capable of supporting its operations to include reliable logistics support, services and
       infrastructure. Site selection should consider geographical dispersion and maximize co-location
       and dual-use facilities.
       2.1.2.4. COOP Plans should include contact information, such as telephone numbers of alternate
       facilities.
   2.1.3. Command COOP plans will address both the relocation and the reconstitution of critical head-
   quarters staff positions during a crisis.
   2.1.4. All COOP plans will address both local (within 100-miles) and regional threat scenarios
   (within 250-miles) that may effect operations.
   2.1.5. COOP Planning Phases.
       2.1.5.1. Normal Operations Phase. During normal daily operations, COOP readiness should
       ensure identification and protection of successors/military authority, accuracy of personnel
       accountability, and readiness of relocation sites. As information and intelligence increases the
       likelihood of attack, every effort should be made to plan for or relocate an initial operating capa-
       bility for critical missions at alternate sites before an attack occurs. This could also include send-
       ing non-essential personnel home, as a means of dispersal.
       2.1.5.2. Activation and Relocation Phase (0-12 hours). During this phase, give emergency prior-
       ity to military operations (including logistical support), continuing C4 ISR functions, transferring
       personnel and computer data/applications necessary to support operations, restoring law and
14                                                            AFI10-208_AFSPCSUP_I 15 JULY 2008


        order, military support to civil authorities, personnel accountability and damage and residual
        resource assessment and reporting.
        2.1.5.3. Alternate Operating Facility Operation Phase. This phase commences with full MEF exe-
        cution with a focus on military operations, communications, transportation, performing other
        essential functions, resource recovery, and reconstituting forces. Organizations should notify C2
        agencies of manpower and capability at alternate locations. Refer to AFI 10-206, Operational
        Reporting for reporting requirements. Address restoration of command staffs, capabilities, and
        functions as resources and operational tasks permit.
        2.1.5.4. Return to Normal Operations Phase. During this phase, begin implementing plans for
        resumption of normal operations. Supervise an orderly return to the normal operating facilities, or
        movement to a temporary or permanent facility. Maintain communication with C2 agencies during
        transition and report mission manpower and capability.
     2.1.6. Meet guidance contained in DODD 3020.26, HAF COOP OPORD, this AFI, and organization
     war and full-spectrum threat response (FSTR) plans. See Federal Preparedness Circular (FPC) 65,
     Federal Executive Branch Continuity of Operations (COOP), for additional planning factors that may
     be adopted to create a viable plan.
     2.1.7. Commands may use subordinate headquarters as alternate headquarters and/or relocation sites
     to carry out their mission during an emergency. Virtual C4 ISR operations may be implemented.
     2.1.8. Where possible, locate alternate headquarters and relocation sites (fixed or mobile) outside
     areas considered prime targets or vulnerable to man-made or natural disasters.
     2.1.9. Organizations without an available alternate headquarters or relocation site, will base COOP
     planning on acceptable mission delays or mission devolution, and plan for force reconstitution.
     2.1.10. Consider the following areas during COOP initial planning, development, and subsequent
     revision:
        2.1.10.1. Specify COOP timing criteria (execution standards) for resuming essential functions
        after interruptions.
        2.1.10.2. Compatibility of emergency action procedures (EAP) and COOP plans. Command
        EAPs and Force Protection Conditions will direct crisis action teams or battle staffs to consider
        COOP implementation.
        2.1.10.3. Available essential command, control, and communication systems at alternate head-
        quarters and relocation sites. List any required emergency communications nodes. Describe com-
        munications procedures. Maintaining all necessary files, documents, computer software, and
        databases required to carryout COOP plans for immediate use by emergency staffs
        2.1.10.4. Identify critical requirements and procurement needs. Develop logistics plans to sustain
        operations at the relocation site. Coordinate logistics requirements with supporting units. If neces-
        sary, use commercial transportation to meet mission criteria.
        2.1.10.5. Outline the decision-making procedures for implementing COOP plans. This should
        include outlining the procedures for organizational advisories, alerts, and COOP plan activation.
        2.1.10.6. Describe organizational structure, succession to command, and delegation of authority
        to appropriate staff.
AFI10-208_AFSPCSUP_I 15 JULY 2008                                                                      15


       2.1.10.7. Establish personnel manning requirements and procedures to ensure sufficient, qualified
       personnel are available throughout the duration of the emergency.
       2.1.10.8. List mission essential documents and equipment. Ensure documents and equipment are
       readily available at the alternate site or transported, as necessary, to the relocation site.
       2.1.10.9. Identify any higher headquarters reporting requirements. Refer to AFI 10-206, Opera-
       tional Reporting.
       2.1.10.10. Describe possible shortfalls and limiting factors.
       2.1.10.11. Establish training requirements and procedures to train or identify qualified personnel
       to fill COOP positions critical to maintaining command and control during emergencies, including
       relocatees.

2.2. Implementing COOP Plans. Take the following actions if an emergency might, or does, require
implementing COOP plans.
   2.2.1. Bring each alternate headquarters or relocation site to a degree of preparedness consistent with
   pre-planned actions to meet Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs).
   2.2.2. If the organization's primary headquarters become inoperative, the alternate headquarters or
   relocation site should automatically assume their responsibilities. Report assumption of command to
   the Air Force Operations Center or the Air Force Emergency Operations Center (AFEOC), if acti-
   vated, in accordance with AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting.
   2.2.3. Subordinate units designated as an alternate headquarters or an activated relocation site will
   monitor the status of the commands above them in their chain of command to ensure readiness to
   assume COOP responsibilities.

2.3. Writing the COOP Plan. Format COOP plans using planning factors as contained in War & Mobi-
lization Plan, Vol 1 (WMP-1), Basic Planning and AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2, Planning Formats and
Guidance. Commands may combine COOP plans with Survival, Recovery, and Reconstitution (SRR)
plans, FSTR or other plans as long as all planning factors, risks and controls are addressed. If Commands
combine COOP plans with their SRR plans or other plans, title plans "COOP/SRR- (organization desig-
nation)." Subordinate organizations will include COOP planning as directed by their Command.
2.3. (AFSPC) Writing the COOP Plan. If existing plans already incorporate COOP-required information,
(see para 4.4.1. (Added)) identify these plans to HQ AFSPC/A3 and forward a current copy; creating a
COOP-specific plan is not required in these instances. Civil Engineering Readiness and Bioenvironmental
functions may provide useful insight for COOP and existing emergency plans. If existing plans can be
revised to include COOP, those plans should be revised at the earliest opportunity (but not more than one
year after this supplement is approved). If a separate COOP Plan is required, use the basic OPLAN format
found in AFMAN 10-401, Vol 2. Structure the plans in phases per AFI 10-208, Chapter 2, Para 2.1.5.,
COOP Planning Phases. Address the planning factors contained in AFI 10-208, Chapter 2 and in Chap-
ter 4 (Added) of this supplement. Use any/all annexes needed to adequately explain COOP requirements.
   2.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units that are AFSPC-gained
   must provide a copy of their COOP plan to HQ AFSPC/A3 and the active duty unit they support. For
   AFRC/ANG units co-located with the AFSPC active duty unit they support, the active duty plan may
   satisfy this requirement, provided AFRC/ANG units are included in the COOP plan. AFSPC-gained
16                                                                AFI10-208_AFSPCSUP_I 15 JULY 2008


     AFRC/ANG units located on non-AFSPC installations must develop COOP plans and should coordi-

                                       Chapter 4 (Added-AFSPC)

                                              AFSPC COOP

4.1. (Added-AFSPC) Introduction. HQ AFSPC and all AFSPC NAFs, Centers, Wings and geographi-
cally separated units will develop COOP plans to ensure both specified and implied mission essential
functions are able to be completed, even in the event of significant disruptions or emergencies, including
at alternate locations and by other agencies/units if applicable. COOP should support mission accomplish-
ment not only during “peacetime” but at higher states of readiness as well. Routine (non-mission essen-
tial) mission, operations and support function completion should also be addressed.
4.2. (Added-AFSPC) Responsibilities.
     4.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) All AFSPC units will identify and prioritize organizational Mission Essen-
     tial Functions (MEF). All AFSPC units will review the National Planning Scenarios (Attachment 2
     (Added)) from the White House Homeland Security Council for consideration in their plans. AFSPC
     units must identify the agency responsible for monitoring COOP plan execution. All AFSPC units
     will forward a copy of COOP plans (or applicable existing plans) to HQ AFSPC/A3O (Current Oper-
     ations Division) when developed and when updated or revised.
     4.2.2. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A3O is responsible for developing and maintaining the HQ
     AFSPC COOP plan to guarantee applicable National Security and DoD MEFs are accomplished by
     HQ AFSPC.
     4.2.3. (Added-AFSPC) All HQ AFSPC directorates will provide planning support to ensure direc-
     torate-specific requirements are met. HQ AFSPC directorate-specific information will be organized in
     annexes to the base HQ AFSPC COOP plan. The HQ AFSPC Crisis Action Team (CAT) is responsi-
     ble for monitoring execution of the HQ AFSPC plan when implemented.
     4.2.4. (Added-AFSPC) The applicable HQ directorate will ensure that continuity programs are ade-
     quately planned, programmed, and budgeted, and that requirements are specifically identified in their
     budgets. This shall include all assets and resources and the development, maintenance, and opera-
     tions of facilities, communications, and transportation capabilities. The applicable HQ directorate will
     apply ORM principles and practices in the development and sustainment of weapon systems as part of
     the acquisition systems engineering process. The applicable HQ directorate will work with AFSPC/
     A8 regarding planning and programming for requirements, and will work with AFSPC/FM for budget
     and execution requirements.
     4.2.5. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A3 will identify operational needs and requirements for backup
     equipment (and/or operations centers) during concept development. To aid in MEF completion if a
     new acquisition should fail, HQ AFSPC/A5 will pursue acquisition of urgent warfighter operational
     requirements.
     4.2.6. (Added-AFSPC) AFSPC/A3 will develop and implement coordinated, multi-year strategic
     management plans for assets and resources in support of COOP.
     4.2.7. (Added-AFSPC) Units tasked in a COOP Plan will report COOP LIMFACs to HQ AFSPC/A3
     by 31 May of each year, negative reports are required. Reports are required for manning shortfalls,
     document/data/equipment problems, workspace limitations including at alternate locations, connec-
     tivity issues, and any other problems adversely affecting continuity of operations. Classify in accor-
     dance with applicable security guidance. Identified LIMFACs should also be identified in SORTS/
AFI10-208_AFSPCSUP_I 15 JULY 2008                                                                         21


   ART reporting, as appropriate. Be aware that compiled vulnerabilities and missions become classified
   and should be handled accordingly.
   4.2.8. (Added-AFSPC) Report all expenditures related to COOP to AFSPC/FM, in accordance with
   guidance provided by AFSPC/FM.
   4.2.9. (Added-AFSPC) Provision must be made for the identification, training, and preparedness of
   personnel capable of relocating to alternate facilities to support the continuation of the performance of
   MEFs. Ensure individuals designated to relocate are qualified to accomplish relocation duties. Civil-
   ians must refer to AFI 36-507, Mobilization of the Civilian Work Force, before accepting a position.
   All primary and alternate designees must possess an appropriate and current security clearance to per-
   form assigned duties at an alternate site.
4.3. (Added-AFSPC) Plan Guidance.
   4.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) Performance of MEFs in a continuity threat or event shall be the basis for
   continuity planning, preparation, and execution. MEFs continue under all circumstances across the
   spectrum of threats. Plans shall be responsive and executable with little or no warning. Units will
   apply ORM principles, concepts, and techniques to assess the risks associated with their daily mission
   and duty-related activities for COOP plan development.
   4.3.2. (Added-AFSPC) Identify relocation sites or platforms for use during continuity threats or
   events. Site selection should consider geographical dispersion, and maximize co-location and
   dual-use facilities. Outline a decision process for determining appropriate actions in implementing
   continuity plans and procedures with or without warning, during duty and non-duty hours, and
   address the stand-down of continuity operations and transition back to normal operations.
   4.3.3. (Added-AFSPC) COOP plans and operations shall be appropriately integrated with the
   emergency plans and capabilities of State, local, territorial, and tribal governments, and private sector
   owners and operators of critical infrastructure, as appropriate, in order to promote interoperability and
   to prevent redundancies and conflicting lines of authority.
4.4. (Added-AFSPC) Plan Development.
The continuity planning processes provided are grouped into three categories: (1) Establishment of Core
Requirements, (2) Determination of Capabilities Requirements, and (3) Writing Plans and Procedures.
   4.4.1. (Added-AFSPC) Establish Core Requirements for Continuity Plan Development. The identi-
   fication of core requirements is the first step in continuity plan development. Core requirements
   include the identification of MEF, supporting activities, vital records, Component continuity staffing
   requirements, delegations of authority, and orders of succession. The core requirements will drive the
   remaining elements of the planning process.
       4.4.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) Identify MEF. The accurate identification of MEF is the foundation of
       a valid continuity plan. The process of determining MEF is critical. All other planning elements
       support and are contingent upon MEF. An accurate assessment of essential functions will allow
       the most efficient use of available personnel and equipment during a crisis. It also allows for
       streamlining of support services that will be required. Units should use the Mission Essential Task
       List (METL) as a starting point for MEF; within AFSPC, MEF and MET are considered equiva-
       lent. If a task/function is identified that is not on the METL, the unit should take actions to update
       the METL accordingly. When identifying MEF, units shall:
22                                                             AFI10-208_AFSPCSUP_I 15 JULY 2008


             4.4.1.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) List all functions that have the potential to be considered “mis-
             sion essential.” Areas of consideration include, but are not limited to: Command and control;
             Command decisions and strategies; Crisis communications including alerts and notifications;
             Crisis data storage, retrieval, and security; Legal obligations; Fiscal and contractual obliga-
             tions; Personnel; Critical support to or from other Federal Agencies and DoD. Additionally,
             units should review higher headquarters (HHQ) MEF for functions they must perform in sup-
             port of the HHQ.
             4.4.1.1.2. (Added-AFSPC) Establish the criticality of each function by examining the conse-
             quences of the nonperformance of those functions. Confirm or eliminate functions as mission
             essential based on the criticality assessment. The Critical Infrastructure Program (CIP) may
             help identify facilities and infrastructure that are particularly vulnerable; the AFSPC Mission
             Assurance Office (AFSPC/A3-MAO) can provide assistance.
             4.4.1.1.3. (Added-AFSPC) Prioritize the functions that have been identified as “mission
             essential” and plan to defer lower priority functions during a crisis.
                4.4.1.1.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) Certain MEF must be uninterrupted or resumed during the
                first 12 hours after the occurrence of an emergency and continued through full resumption
                of all functions. Unit MEF which support the National Essential Functions (NEF) or DoD
                MEF (Attachment 3 (Added)) usually fall into this category.
                4.4.1.1.3.2. (Added-AFSPC) Components will ensure that their operational resiliency is
                commensurate with the criticality of each MEF.
                4.4.1.1.3.3. (Added-AFSPC) Table 4.1. (Added) identifies level of MEFs based on
                elapsed time without being able to perform a given MEF. MEF levels 1 – 2 require a
                back-up/failover capability pre-identified and ready for implementation (less than 12 hours
                to complete function COOP generally requires some sort of “warm” or “hot” standby
                capability). MEF levels 3 – 5 require mitigation actions to be taken, but are of lesser prior-
                ity (i.e., units have more time to recall personnel at home station and deploy them to the
                alternate location). For example, operations may require continuous command and control
                capability, making it a level 1 MEF (required time to complete function COOP is less than
                one hour), while the base library can probably be closed for 30 days with minimal mission
                impact (Level 5). Installation/Wing Commanders (or equivalent) are responsible for deter-
                mining appropriate MEF level; for GSU, the parent wing commander is responsible for
                this determination.

Table 4.1. (Added-AFSPC) Levels of Mission Essential Functions
     Level       Required Time to Complete Function COOP
      1                         Less than 1 hour
      2                        Less than 12 hours
      3                          Within 24 hours
      4                           Within 7 days
      5                          Within 30 days
AFI10-208_AFSPCSUP_I 15 JULY 2008                                                                         23


     4.4.1.2. (Added-AFSPC) Identify Supporting Activities. Supporting activities ensure that MEF
     can be performed as efficiently and effectively as possible during a continuity event. Examples of
     supporting activities are: situational awareness, computer, and IT support; administrative manage-
     ment; infrastructure preparation; personnel and personal preparation; coordination of clearances
     and accesses with alternate facilities; instructions for continuity staffs; and logistics. Additionally,
     Component continuity plans should identify interdependencies with other organizations, both
     within and outside the Department of Defense.
     4.4.1.3. (Added-AFSPC) Identify Vital Records. Vital records and databases are those docu-
     ments, references, records, and information systems needed to support MEF during a continuity
     event and include those records and information systems necessary for reconstitution to normal
     operations after the crisis. Continuity plans will ensure that relocation sites provide adequate con-
     nectivity, hardware, software, information assurance, and related infrastructure to ensure access to
     the systems necessary to support their execution of MEF. All processes and procedures for the
     preservation and retrieval of all vital electronic records, databases, and information systems will
     be identified to and coordinated with the Component Chief Information Officer (CIO) or equiva-
     lent office.
     4.4.1.4. (Added-AFSPC) Establish Continuity Staffing Requirements. Continuity staffs consist
     of personnel who will proceed to an alternate operating facility to continue MEF during a continu-
     ity event. Establish primary and alternate personnel rosters to fill identified positions (remember
     that some leaders may have participation responsibilities in higher level continuity plans) and
     ensure those personnel receive required clearances and access.
     4.4.1.5. (Added-AFSPC) Establish Orders of Succession. Orders of succession shall be estab-
     lished for each unit.
     4.4.1.6. (Added-AFSPC) Establish Delegations of Authority. Units shall establish delegations of
     authorities for decision and policy making. This is crucial to allow a rapid response in a crisis sit-
     uation. Continuity plans shall: 1) Identify what authorities are delegated and to whom including
     any limits of authority or accountability; 2) Identify the circumstances under which the authorities
     are delegated.
  4.4.2. (Added-AFSPC) Determination of Capabilities Requirements. Once the core requirements of
  a continuity plan have been identified, capabilities necessary for the performance of MEF can be iden-
  tified. Capabilities requirements include:
     4.4.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) Alternate Operating Facilities. Alternate operating facilities will be
     identified for continuity operating environments. Alternate operating facilities should take into
     account MEF level, maximize “dual use” and provide geographical dispersion (preferred). MEF
     levels 1 and 2 are highest priority and must be satisfied; Levels 3 – 5 require mitigation actions to
     be taken, but are of lesser priority. Where possible, give consideration to transferring responsibil-
     ity to an unaffected unit; sufficient space must be available for augmentation personnel to perform
     required duties.
         4.4.2.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) Units must address the reliability of the existing level of service
         agreements and commitments from commercial vendors when identifying their requirements
         at alternate operating facilities.
         4.4.2.1.2. (Added-AFSPC) Alternate facilities must be capable of sustaining MEF operations
         for a minimum of 30 days.
24                                                             AFI10-208_AFSPCSUP_I 15 JULY 2008


            4.4.2.1.3. (Added-AFSPC) Physical security including perimeter, access, and internal func-
            tions commensurate with operations. Risk assessments to identify and assess potential hazards
            or limitations relative to the location of the facility should be conducted when selecting alter-
            nate operating facilities. Risk considerations include, but are not limited to, reliability and
            back-up capabilities inherent to local power, telecommunications, internet grids, physical
            security, single points of failure for critical facility systems, and geographic proximity hazards
            such as nearby facilities manufacturing or storing hazardous materials. Plans should take into
            account the possibility that civilian authorities may restrict travel in/out of various locations,
            which may impact travel between primary/alternate locations.
            4.4.2.1.4. (Added-AFSPC) When the alternate operating facility belongs to another Federal
            Agency, DoD Component or Military Service, establish a Memorandum of Agreement/Mem-
            orandum of Understanding with the host to ensure facility/infrastructure availability and readi-
            ness to support continuity requirements.
        4.4.2.2. (Added-AFSPC) Transportation and Logistics Coordination. Transportation plans for
        movement of personnel to alternate operating facilities must be executable. Procedures shall be
        developed for maintaining the readiness of alternate operating facilities, to include pre-positioning
        and upgrade/routine maintenance of unique equipment required to perform MEF at alternate oper-
        ating facilities. Develop procedures for procuring equipment and supplies that are not pre-posi-
        tioned. Where possible, shelter-in-place options are acceptable, and may be preferable to facility
        evacuation. Finally, coordination should include required transportation for retrograde from alter-
        nate back to primary location.
        4.4.2.3. (Added-AFSPC) Interoperable Communications (as required: Secure/Non-Secure,
        Voice, Data, Video, Fax). Communications and network connectivity at alternate operating facili-
        ties must be commensurate with the execution requirements of the MEF.
        4.4.2.4. (Added-AFSPC) Fly-Away Kits. Fly-away kits consist of critical office items/records
        that cannot be pre-positioned at alternate operating facilities. An itemized list of fly-away kit con-
        tents should be developed as well as procedures for movement of the kits to an alternate operating
        facility. Data that is part of a fly-away kit should be backed-up as often as possible to keep data
        loss to a minimum in the event of a continuity event. Retrograde back to primary facilities must
        take into account the requirement to provide the same level of information as the initial relocation/
        deployment.
     4.4.3. (Added-AFSPC) Writing Plans and Procedures. Plans and procedures should provide clear
     objectives and instructions to personnel for preparation and implementation of continuity plans under
     all circumstances. Plans must be executable with or without warning and during duty or non-duty
     hours.
        4.4.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) Plan content will identify:
            4.4.3.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) Core requirements and capabilities.
            4.4.3.1.2. (Added-AFSPC) Procedures for an executive decision process that allows for
            assessment of a threat, or potential threat situation, and the determination of plan activation for
            response and recovery actions.
            4.4.3.1.3. (Added-AFSPC) Procedures to include the positions within the unit that have the
            authority to activate the continuity plan.
AFI10-208_AFSPCSUP_I 15 JULY 2008                                                                           25


         4.4.3.1.4. (Added-AFSPC) Procedures to execute the plan if Higher Headquarters has
         directed activation of all or specific continuity plans.
         4.4.3.1.5. (Added-AFSPC) An incident management team and/or procedures for providing
         critical situational information to the key decision makers.
             4.4.3.1.5.1. (Added-AFSPC) Units must have the capability to monitor the condition of
             their facility on a 24/7 basis, and at a minimum must have procedures to remain in contact
             with the facility.
             4.4.3.1.5.2. (Added-AFSPC) Offices that are located in non-government buildings will
             establish a Memorandum of Agreement/Memorandum of Understanding with the building
             owner to obtain timely building information (e.g., fire alarms, power outages) and estab-
             lish procedures for conveying pertinent facility information to the incident management
             team.
     4.4.3.2. (Added-AFSPC) Operations Security (OPSEC) Requirements. OPSEC requirements
     must be integrated into all aspects of the Component plan.
     4.4.3.3. (Added-AFSPC) Alert and Notification Systems for Contacting Personnel. Alert and
     notification procedures shall provide guidance for all unit personnel including non-relocation staff
     and contractor support. Alerts and notifications may continue throughout a continuity event. Alert
     and notification procedures and processes will be developed that are executable during: Duty
     hours; Non-duty hours; Situations that provide warning of an incident; Incidents or attacks that
     occur with no warning.
     4.4.3.4. (Added-AFSPC) Evacuation and Relocation Procedures: Use of existing building evac-
     uation plans; Identification of primary and alternate assembly areas for continuity relocation staff
     members to report to upon exiting the building (Some situations may not require the use of assem-
     bly areas (e.g., activation of a plan prior to a crisis or incident)); Identification of alternate reloca-
     tion procedures for no warning attacks when primary notification/alert systems cannot be
     implemented; Identification of primary and alternate transportation for relocation staff; Account-
     ability procedures for all unit personnel. Use of established accountability procedures is preferred
     vice creating “unique” procedures specific for continuity.
     4.4.3.5. (Added-AFSPC) Alternate Operating Facilities Procedures. Operations procedures for
     the continuity relocation staff shall be developed that include: briefing covering information on
     the support available at the facility; Initial action requirements; Stowing gear/equipment; Check-
     ing access to vital records and essential documents; Test available communications systems
     (Voice, radio, computer, etc), as appropriate for the prevailing OPSEC environment; Initiate com-
     munications with (other) critical continuity elements and agencies; Perform accountability check
     for all personnel. Most importantly, procedures must allow for conduct of operations, to include:
     Develop initial status report; Determine which MEF have been affected; Establish MEF restora-
     tion effort as required; Determine requirements and coordinate procurement of additional equip-
     ment and/or supplies.
     4.4.3.6. (Added-AFSPC) Reconstitution. Reconstitution requirements will depend directly upon
     the extent of the crisis and the resultant environment. Unit continuity plans shall incorporate infor-
     mation that will be critical to their reconstitution effort including identification of: Facility
     requirements for resumption of all unit activities; Contacts and organizations responsible for pro-
     viding reconstitution support to the unit; vendors and other outsourcing support for reconstitution.

     4.4.4. (Added-AFSPC) Plan Approval. Plans will be approved by the appropriate commander (i.e.,
     NAF plan is approved by NAF/CC; Wing plan by Wing/CC). The preference is for Installation COOP,
     however this is not always feasible (i.e., HQ AFSPC will have a stand-alone COOP from Peterson
     AFB; 14 AF may have a stand-alone COOP from Vandenberg AFB; Los Angeles AFB may include
     COOP for SMC and tenant wings). AFSPC units that are tenants on non-AFSPC installations must
     develop COOP plans in coordination with the installation commander; in this case, the AFSPC unit
     commander is responsible for approving his/her unit’s COOP.
4.5. (Added-AFSPC) Training and Exercises. Key personnel must be trained on their roles and duties
to implement their COOP plan. Exercises (both command-wide and local) will apply COOP plan steps
and ensure currency of the plan. Test and exercise COOP plans at least annually or as otherwise directed;
tests and exercises should account for varying weather/seasonal conditions, as appropriate. Incorporate
lessons learned, as appropriate, when revising plans.

Command and Control (C2)—The authority that a commander in the Armed Forces lawfully exercises
over subordinates by virtue of rank or assignment. Command includes the authority and responsibility for
effectively using available resources and planning the employment of, organizing, directing, coordinating,
and controlling military forces for the accomplishment of assigned missions. It also includes
responsibility for health, welfare, morale, and discipline of assigned personnel. Command and control
operations represent the execution direction of the commander’s warfighting intent. Command and
control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications,
facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling
forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission.
Command and Control Systems (C2 Systems)—The facilities, equipment, communications,
procedures, and personnel essential to a commander for planning, directing and controlling operations of
assigned forces pursuant to the mission assigned. For aerospace forces, C2 systems consist of mission
essential technology elements and processes needed by people to perform their assigned command and
control functions.
Continuity of Government—A coordinated effort within each Branch of Government ensuring the
capability to continue Branch minimum essential responsibilities in a catastrophic crisis. Continuity of
Government is dependent on effective continuity of operations plans and capabilities. DOD Continuity of
30                                                            AFI10-208_AFSPCSUP_I 15 JULY 2008


Government activities involve ensuring continuity of DOD MEF through plans and procedures governing
succession to office; emergency delegations of authority (where permissible, and in accordance with
applicable law); the safekeeping of vital resources, facilities, and records; the improvisation or emergency
acquisition of vital resources necessary for the performance of MEF; and the capability to relocate
essential personnel and functions to, and sustain performance of MEF at, alternate work site(s) until
normal operations can be resumed.
Continuity of Operations (COOP)—An internal effort within individual components of the Executive,
Legislative, and Judicial Branches of Government assuring the capability exists to continue uninterrupted
essential component functions across a wide range of potential emergencies, including localized acts of
nature, accidents, and technological and/or attack-related emergencies. COOP involves plans and
capabilities covering the same functional objectives of Continuity of Government, must be maintained at
a high level of readiness, and be capable of implementation both with and without warning. COOP is not
only an integral part of Continuity of Government and Enduring Constitutional Government (ECG), but is
simply "good business practice" - part of the Department of Defense's fundamental mission as a
responsible and reliable public institution.
Crisis—An incident or situation involving a threat to the United States, its territories, citizens, military
forces, possessions, or vital interests that develops rapidly and creates a condition of such diplomatic,
economic, political, or military importance that commitment of U.S. military forces and resources is
contemplated to achieve national objectives.
Critical Infrastructure Program (CIP)—USAF CIP is a capability focused mission assurance program
that encompasses Air Force and non-AF owned assets and infrastructures (foreign and domestic), both
physical and cyber, that are essential to planning, mobilizing, deploying, executing and sustaining
military operations on a global basis, assuring their availability when required.
Defense Continuity Executive Steering Group (Continuity ESG)—Se nior re pr ese nt ati ve s from
designated OSD Components, Joint Staff, Military Services, and Defense Agencies that serve as the
"board of directors" for the DCP to provide guidance and oversight for DOD continuity-related activities,
while developing and implementing a DOD-wide continuity strategy for the twenty-first century threat
environment. The Continuity ESG also adjudicates functional disputes concerning the use of common
DOD continuity resources that support the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
Defense Continuity Program (DCP)—An integrated program comprised of defense policies, plans,
procedures, assets, and resources that ensures continuity of DOD Component MEF under all
circumstances, including crisis, attack, recovery, and reconstitution. It encompasses the DOD
Components performing Continuity of Operations, Continuity of Government, and Enduring
Constitutional Government functions across the spectrum of threats to continuity.
Enduring Constitutional Government (ECG)—A cooperative effort among the Executive, Legislative,
and Judicial Branches of Government, coordinated by the President, to preserve the capability to execute
constitutional responsibilities in a catastrophic crisis. ECG is the overarching goal; its objective is the
preservation of the constitutional framework under which the Nation is governed. ECG requires orderly
succession and appropriate transition of leadership, and integrated performance of essential functions by
all three Branches of Government. ECG is dependent on effective COOP and Continuity of Government
capabilities.

Emergency Relocation Staff—Members directly supporting uninterrupted operational capability and
COOP execution.
Information Assurance (IA)—Information operations that protect and defend information and
information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and
non-repudiation. This includes providing for restoration of information systems by incorporating
protection, detection, and reaction capabilities.
Mission Essential Functions (MEF)—The specified or implied tasks required to be performed by, or
derived from, statute or Executive order, and those organizational activities that must be performed under
all circumstances to achieve DOD Component missions or responsibilities in a continuity threat or event.
Failure to perform or sustain these functions would significantly impact DOD ability to provide vital
services, or exercise authority, direction, and control.
National Capital Region (NCR)—The geographic area located within the boundaries of the District of
Columbia; Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties in the State of Maryland; Arlington, Fairfax,
Loudoun, and Prince William Counties and the Cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Manassas, and
Manassas Park in the Commonwealth of Virginia; and all cities and other units of government within the
geographic areas of such District, Counties, and Cities.
National Security Emergency—Any occurrence including, but not limited to, natural disaster, military
attack, technological failures, civil unrest, or other disruptive condition that seriously degrades or
threatens the national security of the United States.
Reconstitution—The rebuilding of an organization by relocating selected personnel from subordinate
organizations to a designated location to assume the mission essential functions performed by the
higher-level organization.
Reconstitution Site—A location selected by the surviving organization as the site at which a damaged or
destroyed function can be reformed by survivors of the attack and personnel from other sources,
designated as replacements.
Relocation Site—The site selected by an organization that is capable of supporting the logistics and
communications necessary to continue an organization’s mission essential functions.
Supported Commander—The commander having primary responsibility for all aspects of a task
assigned by the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan or other joint operation planning authority. In the context
of joint operation planning, this term refers to the commander who prepares operation plans or operation
orders in response to requirements of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In the context of a support
command relationship, the commander who receives assistance from another commander's force or
capabilities, and who is responsible for ensuring that the supporting commander understands the
assistance required. See also support; supporting commander
Supporting Commander—A commander who provides augmentation forces or other support to a
supported commander or who develops a supporting plan. Includes the designated combatant commands
and Defense agencies as appropriate. In the context of a support command relationship, the commander
who aids, protects, complements, or sustains another commander's force, and who is responsible for

                              NATIONAL PLANNING SCENARIOS

A2.1. (Added-AFSPC) The following information is provided to give units a basic understanding of the
types of Scenarios under development by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The National
Response Framework, dated January 2008, outlines Key Scenario Sets, with associated National Plan-
ning Scenarios, to integrate planning for like events, conduct capability development and represent haz-
ards of national concern. The National Planning Scenarios will provide greater detail of each scenario
including a Scenario Overview, Planning Considerations, and Implications; when developing local COOP
scenarios/exercises, units should refer to the approved DHS scenario(s) for more information.

A2.2. (Added-AFSPC) The scenarios are planning tools and are representative of the range of potential
terrorist attacks and natural disasters and the related impacts that face our nation. The objective was to
develop a minimum number of credible scenarios in order to establish the range of response requirements
to facilitate preparedness planning.
A2.3. (Added-AFSPC) These scenarios were compiled to be the minimum number necessary to develop
the range of response capabilities and resources, other hazards were inevitably omitted. Examples of other
potentially high-impact events include nuclear power plant incidents, industrial and transportation acci-
dents, and frequently occurring natural disasters. Units are not precluded from developing their own sce-
narios to supplement the National Planning Scenarios.
A2.4. (Added-AFSPC) While not meant to be all-inclusive, the scenarios provide a basic set of common
homeland security events and their related impacts that can be employed at the national level or by States
and localities. Although certain areas have special concerns—for example, continuity of Government in
Washington, DC; viability of financial markets in New York; and trade and commerce in other major cit-
ies—the scenarios have been developed in a way that allows them to be adapted to local conditions. Agen-
cies will not be limited to this set of Scenarios, and they will continue to be able to use exercise scenarios
that are not specifically included in the planning set. However, when exercising the basic events included
in the Scenario set, the Scenarios provide a mutual starting point.
