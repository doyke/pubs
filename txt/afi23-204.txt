SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The major changes
include clarification of organizational fuel tank types, the addition of Logistics Readiness
Squadron Quality Assurance function and tank inspection responsibilities.
1. Organizational Fuel Tanks.
 2                                                                      AFI23-204 24 JULY 2012


     1.1. The Air Force stores bulk petroleum products in organizational tanks when operational
     needs make it difficult to get fuel from centralized base fuels facilities.
     1.2. To prevent fraud, theft, and misappropriation, the organization commander manages,
     controls, and accounts for all fuel issued from and received into their organizational tanks.
2. Types of Organizational Fuel Tanks.
     2.1. The design of fuel tank systems varies by location. In general, tanks established by
     organizations with a purpose of storing petroleum products are to be managed as
     organizational fuel tanks.
     2.2. There are three categories of organizational fuel tanks: support, issue and portable.
     2.3. A support tank is any tank that is physically connected, by fixed piping, to a consuming
     facility or installed piece of equipment. (Generators/Hush houses/Fuel test cells) NOTE:
     Do not issue fuel from support tanks to vehicles or other equipment.
     2.4. An issue tank is any tank that is not physically connected to any equipment or facility,
     and is used to dispense fuel to vehicles, mobile trailers, ground support equipment, or
     portable containers.
     2.5. A portable tank is any mobile tank used for mobility maintenance, research and
     development, or similar purposes.
     2.6. Organizational tanks do not include fuel tanks integral to the operation of vehicles, any
     type of hand-carried safety cans, tanks (mobile or fixed) used to temporarily hold fuel for
     meter calibration uses (i.e., Prover Tanks) or bowsers. NOTE: Portable tanks may be used
     for either issue or support purposes.
3. Establishing an Organizational Tank. Organizations that need to establish temporary or
permanent tanks must:
     3.1. Coordinate all requests for establishing organizational tanks through the local Fuels
     Management Team (FMT) first to ensure fuel cannot be efficiently provided from existing
     infrastructure.
        3.1.1. The request will include reasons why existing vehicle or ground support
        equipment service stations cannot be used. It also will describe the capacity and
        proposed location of the tank, the grade of fuel to be stored, and the type of equipment or
        vehicles to be supported.
     3.2. Once the FMT validates this request, the organization submits a work request to Base
     Civil Engineering (BCE) IAW AFI 32-7044, Storage Tank Compliance.
4. Responsibilities.
     4.1. The Wing Commander:
        4.1.1. Ensures that organization and tenant storage tanks are compliant with applicable
        Federal, state and local regulations.

     training class. This letter will remain on file in the organizational tank custodian file
     plan.
     4.3.2. Ensures only trained tank custodians: take delivery/receipt of fuel products,
     accomplishes and reviews any required documentation.        NOTE: The point of sale
     from Defense Logistics Agency Energy (DLA Energy) contracted delivery vendors to an
     Air Force organization occurs when the fuel is delivered into the organizational storage
     tank.
     4.3.3. Is responsible for fuel spills, reporting spills and reporting or repairing tank
     deficiencies.

   9.2. Documentation for Organizational Tank Issues: NOTE: Fuel will only be dispensed
   from organization ―issue‖ tanks. Organization ―support‖ tanks will not be used to dispense
   fuel.   WARNING: For safety purposes, when gauging above ground tanks, controls will
   be in place to prevent people from falling [See Air Force Occupational Safety and Health
   Standard (AFOSH STD) 91-302, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire
   Protection, and Health Standard].

          Fuel.     NOTE: Non DoD vehicles and equipment not under contract to use
          government provided fuels will not be refueled from organizational tanks. In the
          event of an emergency or natural disaster where refueling of non DoD, non contract
          vehicles and equipment is necessary, contact the Air Force Petroleum Agency
          (AFPA), through the applicable MAJCOM fuels activity for approval.

        Energy Automation Information Systems (AIS) Application Access.
     9.3. Documentation for Organizational Tank Receipts:
        9.3.1. The tank custodian will gauge the receipt tank(s) prior to receipt, with fuel and
        water finding paste to determine the actual physical inventory. Remove any detected
        water IAW T.O. 42B-1-1.
        9.3.2. The tank custodian prepares an AF IMT 500 for the receipt tank(s) and:
