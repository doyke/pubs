    4.7. Other parking considerations.
       4.7.1. Ceremonies and special event reserved parking is available and under normal
       circumstances must not exceed 50 total spots. Requests for parking will be submitted to

       Protocol Office.
           4.7.1.1. Designated parking will be provided for conferences with an O-6 or GG-15
           in attendance. Facility Management will receive notification of requests from the
           Protocol Office and will provide cones to mark the reserved parking area. The
           Protocol Office will determine priority when multiple conference and event schedules
           conflict.
       4.7.2. Other designated parking will be managed IAW Lackland AFB Instruction 31-
