                                                Chapter 1

                                     GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. All evaluations will be conducted IAW the provisions of AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Stan-
dardization/Evaluation Program, and this instruction. Information gathering documents will be estab-
lished as forms in accordance with AFI 37-160V8, The Air Force Publications and Forms Management
Program - Developing and Processing Forms.
    1.1.1. Cockpit Resource Management (CRM) skills will be evaluated along with technical skills as
    outlined in the Pilot grading criteria in this chapter. CRM skills are imbedded within the appropriate
    grading criteria; the use of IMT 4031 is not required.

1.2. Waivers. IAW AFPD 11-2, AF/XO is approval authority for changes/revisions to this instruction.
Waiver authority for this instruction is the MAJCOM DO. Waivers will be requested from the parent
MAJCOM Stan/Eval through appropriate channels. Copies of waiver requests do not need to be for-
warded to AF/XOOT.

1.3. Procedures:
    1.3.1. Flight Examiners (FEs) will use the evaluation criteria contained in Chapter 3 for all flight and
    emergency procedure evaluations. FEs will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation cri-
    teria.
    1.3.2. Recording devices (Video Tape Recorder (VTRs), tape recorders, Air Combat Maneuvering
    Instrumentation (ACMI), etc.) should be used, when available, to reconstruct/evaluate the mission.
    1.3.3. The FE may fly in any flight position (to include chase) to conduct a thorough evaluation.
    1.3.4. The FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be conducted.
    Prior to flight, the examinee will accomplish required flight planning in accordance with the flight
    position assigned during the evaluation. Higher Headquarters (HHQ) FEs (and unit FEs as deter-
    mined locally) will be furnished a copy of necessary mission data and mission materials.
    1.3.5. Areas indicated with an "R" are required items for that evaluation. A required area is a specific
    area that must be evaluated to complete the evaluation. All required areas must be included in the
    evaluation profile, except as noted in the table. Required areas are shown in Table 2.1. and Table 2.2.
    When it is impossible to evaluate a required area in flight, it will be evaluated by an alternate method
    (i.e., in an aircrew training device (ATD) or cockpit procedure trainer (CPT) or by oral examination)
    in order to complete the evaluation. The reason why required area(s) were not evaluated inflight and
    the alternate method of evaluation used will be documented in the Additional Comments portion of
    the IMT 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
    1.3.6. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. At a minimum, this debrief will include
    the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified) and
    any required additional training.

1.4. Grading Instructions. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-202V2 and
this instruction. The appropriate ACFT designation that should be placed in section I of the Certificate
of Aircrew Qualification is “A-10, OA-10 or A/OA-10” as appropriate.
AFI11-2A-OA-10V2 16 NOVEMBER 2005                                                                           5


     1.4.1. The FE will base tolerances for inflight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stable air-
     craft. The FE will not consider momentary deviations from tolerances; provided the examinee applies
     prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying safety. The FE will consider
     cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
     1.4.2. When grading criteria specify that airspeed/Angle of Attack (AOA) be evaluated and the flight
     manual lists only a minimum/maximum/recommended airspeed/AOA for that area, the examinee will
     brief the desired airspeed/AOA.
     1.4.3. The FE will compare examinee performance for each area accomplished during the evaluation
     with the standards provided in this instruction and assign an appropriate grade for the area. The FE
     will derive the overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades based on a composite for the
     observed events and tasks IAW this instruction.
        1.4.3.1. FEs will use the grading criteria in this instruction to determine individual area grades.
        FE judgment must be exercised when the wording of areas is subjective and when specific situa-
        tions are not covered.
        1.4.3.2. If the examinee receives an area grade of "U" in any of the critical areas identified by this
        instruction, an overall grade of "Unqualified" will be assigned. Unsatisfactory performance in any
        critical area or critical subarea will result in qualification level of "Q-3."
        1.4.3.3. FE judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.
        1.4.3.4. The following general criteria apply during all phases of flight except as noted for spe-
        cific events and instrument final approaches:

Table 1.1. General Criteria.
Q         Altitude         +/- 200 feet
          Airspeed         +/- 5%
          Course           +/- 5 degrees/3 NM (whichever is greater)
          TACAN Arc        +/- 2 NM
Q-        Altitude         +/- 300 feet
          Airspeed         +/- 10%
          Course           +/- 10 degrees/5 NM (whichever is greater)
          TACAN Arc        +/- 3 NM
U                          Exceeded Q- limits

1.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). If available and configured appropriately, ATD will be
used to conduct the requisite EPE. If an ATD is not used, the EPE will be conducted in an appropriate unit
training device (UTD), FMT, or CPT, in order of preference. If unable to use a CPT, the EPE will be given
orally. This evaluation will include areas commensurate with examinee’s ready aircrew program (RAP)
training level. Table 2.2. lists standardized EPE grading areas.
     1.5.1. The following items will be included on all emergency procedures evaluations:
        1.5.1.1. Aircraft General Knowledge.
6                                                           AFI11-2A-OA-10V2 16 NOVEMBER 2005


       1.5.1.2. A minimum of two emergency procedures per phase of flight (i.e., pre-takeoff, takeoff,
       cruise and landing), and include all Bold Face procedures.
       1.5.1.3. Flight Coordination (if applicable).
       1.5.1.4. Unusual attitude recoveries will be evaluated during all EPEs. This fulfills the Area 15,
       Unusual Attitude Recoveries, requirement for Pilot Instrument/Qualification evaluations.
    1.5.2. The following additional items will be included on EPEs as a requisite for the instrument and/
    or qualification evaluation:
       1.5.2.1. AFMAN 11-217, Vol 1, Instrument Procedures. Evaluate use of standby/emergency
       instruments.
       1.5.2.2. Alternate/Divert Airfields. If possible, evaluate a minimum of one approach at other than
       home base.
    1.5.3. Mission evaluation scenarios should be tailored to unit tasking. The following additional items
    should be included on the emergency procedures evaluation given as a requisite to the mission evalu-
    ation.
       1.5.3.1. Weapons system operation.
       1.5.3.2. Electronic Attack (EA)/Electronic Protection (EP)/Radar Warning Receiver (RWR).
       1.5.3.3. Evasive action.
       1.5.3.4. Weapons delivery and switchology.
    1.5.4. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade will be placed in supervised status until rec-
    ommended additional training is completed and or a reevaluation is successfully accomplished.
    Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade because of an unsatisfactory Bold Face Emergency
    accomplishment will not be permitted to fly in their aircrew position until a successful reevaluation is
    accomplished. For qualified pilots that require an additional training EPE(s), the FE will indicate if the
    additional training will be accomplished before the flight evaluation. Additional training and reeval-
    uations will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2.
    1.5.5. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs:
       1.5.5.1. Q. Performance is correct. Quickly recognizes and corrects errors.
       1.5.5.2. Q-. Performance is safe, but indicates limited proficiency. Makes errors of omission or
       commission.
       1.5.5.3. U. Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or ability.

1.6. Documentation of Weapons Employment Results. Weapons employment results will be docu-
mented in the Mission Description Section of the IMT 8 for mission evaluations.
    1.6.1. Air-to-Surface . Hit or Miss IAW AFI 11-2A/OA-10V1, A/OA-10 Aircrew Training, will be
    entered for each air-to-surface record delivery. For air scored event or for VTR assessed deliveries,
    FEs will determine weapons employment results. Air scored or VTR assessed deliveries will be anno-
    tated with an asterisk (or asterisks as required). Document results using "Hit/Miss" as in the following
    example:
AFI11-2A-OA-10V2 16 NOVEMBER 2005                                                                        7


  Weapons delivery scores were:
       LALD          VLD          LAHD
       Hit*          Hit**        Hit/Miss
       *VTR assessed / **Air Scored
  1.6.2. Forward Air Control (FAC) Target Marks. For the purpose of FAC target mark, marks will
  be scored as a hit or a miss by the FE in either FAC or fighter aircraft. Marks will be scored as a "Hit"
  if they are considered usable for marking the designated target, delivered in a timely manner and
  delivery used is tactically sound. They will be scored as a "Miss" if they are unusable for target mark-
  ing, untimely or the deliveries are tactically unsound (i.e., excessive altitude loss, unnecessary expo-
  sure to the threat, excessive track time, etc.). Document results as in the following example:
  Weapons delivery scores were:
  TAC RX
  Hit/Hit/Hit/Miss
  1.6.3. Air-to-Air. Record the number of simulated missile/gun firing attempts and the number that
  were valid as in the following example (if applicable):
                   ATTEMPTED                     VALID
  AIM-9                  2                           1
  1.6.4. FE Judgment. FE judgment will be the determining factor in deciding the weapons employ-
  ment grade. If the examinee fails to qualify in any event(s), the FE may elect to award a higher area
  grade than warranted by the score(s). The FE will include justification for such an award in the Addi-
  tional Comments Section of the IMT 8. Include entries for each type of simulated ordnance that was
  employed.

                                  EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General.
    2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202, Vol 2, Chapter 4. The procedures
    and flight profiles outlined in this chapter apply to all A/OA-10 units. For all evaluations including
    initial, the IMT 8 will be annotated with “A-10, OA-10 or A/OA-10” as appropriate in the ACFT/
    CREW position. Evaluation requirements are depicted in Table 2.1. With the approval of the Opera-
    tions Group Commander, the Instrument/Qualification Evaluation (2.2.) and the Mission Evaluation
    (2.3.) may be combined as a single evaluation. Unit Commanders, with coordination through the unit
    Chief of Stan/Eval may designate experienced pilots for this combined evaluation option. Evaluations
    flown in this manner must fulfill all current I/Q and Mission evaluation requirements, including
    ground phase requisites. This combined evaluation will have a single expiration date IAW AFI
    11-202 volume 2.
    2.1.2. If it is impossible to accomplish a required area inflight, the FE may elect to evaluate the
    area(s) by an alternate method (i.e., UTD, cockpit procedure training (CPT), orally, etc.), in order to
    complete the evaluation. If the FE determines the required item cannot be adequately evaluated by an
    alternate method, the examinee will require an additional flight to complete the evaluation.
    2.1.3. Currency of Flight Publications. Publications that will be checked during the qualification
    evaluation are:
       2.1.3.1. T.O. 1A-10-1 (ACC/PACAF)
       2.1.3.2. T.O. 1A-10-1CL-1.
       2.1.3.3. T.O. 1A-10-34-1CL-1.
       2.1.3.4. Local Inflight Guide.
       2.1.3.5. Any additional publications specified in the unit supplement to AFI 11-202V2.

2.2. Instrument/Qualification Evaluation . A mission flown according to instrument flight rules (to the
maximum extent practical) best fulfills the objective of the instrument/qualification evaluation. To the
maximum extent possible, this evaluation will include approaches at airfields other than home or
deployed locations (USAFE: Preferably non-US locations). This evaluation may be administered on
any compatible training mission with the approval of the unit Chief of Stan/Eval with Commander’s con-
currence. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
    2.2.1. Instrument examination.
    2.2.2. Closed and open book qualification examinations.
    2.2.3. EPE.
    2.2.4. Bold Face Written Exam. Answers must contain all Bold Face items in proper sequence.
    Abbreviations are allowed.

2.3. Mission Evaluation. Scenarios that represent unit Designed Operational Capability (DOC) tasking
satisfy the requirements of this evaluation. The profiles will be designed to evaluate the training/flight
AFI11-2A-OA-10V2 16 NOVEMBER 2005                                                                           9


position/special qualifications as well as basic airmanship of the examinee. Initial mission evaluations
will be given in the primary DOC of the unit. Mission evaluations will normally be flown using unit for-
mations and tactics. Examinees will be evaluated in the position of their highest qualification. If briefed,
at the FEs discretion, portions may be flown in another position, but the emphasis is to have examinees
evaluated at their highest qualification level. Based on the examinee’s experience level, a wingman may
be required to brief (to include tactics) and/or lead certain phases of the mission, but will not be evaluated
using flight lead grading criteria. Evaluations during exercises or deployments are encouraged.
   2.3.1. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
       2.3.1.1. EPE
       2.3.1.2. Bold Face Written Exam. Answers must contain all Bold Face items in proper sequence.
       Abbreviations are allowed.
NOTE: Basic Mission Capable (BMC) pilots will only be evaluated on those missions routinely per-
formed. Examinees will only be evaluated on those areas for which they are qualified.
   2.3.2. Air to Surface. First look navigation and lookalike targets are encouraged. Navigation should
   be of sufficient length relative to unit plans, with timing appropriate to the tasking. Mission profiles
   should include actual delivery of practice or live ordnance. Ordnance deliveries may be dry if they can
   be validated. In addition, dry passes are permitted if, in the FE's opinion:
       2.3.2.1. Accomplishing an actual delivery would significantly decrease the realism of the sortie.
       2.3.2.2. The mission profile is a realistic sortie and allows a thorough evaluation of the examinee,
       but does not terminate on a range.
   2.3.3. Forward Air Control (FAC). Air to surface evaluation requirements/grading criteria will be
   used IAW paragraph 2.3.2.
       2.3.3.1. A/OA-10 Dual Qualified Pilots. Squadron commanders and unit Stan/Eval will ensure
       that individual dual qualified pilots receive the appropriate mix of A-10 and OA-10 mission eval-
       uations. The goal is to have an equal sampling of both A-10 and OA-10 mission evaluations.

2.4. Formal Course Evaluation. Syllabus evaluations will be flown IAW syllabus mission profile
guidelines if stated, or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training objectives. Formal course
guidelines may be modified, based on local operating considerations or FE judgment, to complete the
evaluation. Training objectives and related areas will be graded using the performance criteria in Chap-
ter 3.

2.5. Instructor Evaluation. Instructor evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2, Chapter 4.
Flight evaluations will include a thorough evaluation of the examinee’s instructor knowledge and ability.
This is a one-time check in which the examinee must demonstrate ability to instruct in some phase of the
unit’s mission. Except for requirements delineated in Table 2.1. specific profiles and/or events will be
determined by the flight examiner. Subsequent evaluations (for example, Instrument/Qualification, Mis-
sion) will include instructor portions during the evaluations.
   2.5.1. Instructor pilots (IPs) should demonstrate proficiency in flying a portion of the mission in the
   chase position.

     2.5.2. Formal Training Unit (FTU) and Weapons Instructor School (WIC) Instructor Pilot .
     FTU and WIC Instructor Pilot mission evaluation profiles will normally be IAW the formal course
     syllabus for any mission which the IP is qualified to instruct. The only required items for an FTU or
     WIC IP mission check are those items required by the syllabus, for the specific sortie being flown.

NOTES:
1. Airwork/Advanced Handling/Tactical Maneuvering. This area is required for pilots receiving
   Instrument/Qualification evaluations. Units will determine appropriate proficiency maneuvers for
   type aircraft and/or pilot experience levels. Examples are, but are not limited to:
   a. Aerobatics
   b. Confidence maneuvers
   c. Approaches to stalls
   d. Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM)
   e. Advanced handling characteristics
   f. Formation (close, tactical, trail)
2. Unusual Attitude Recoveries. Do not perform unusual attitude recoveries in flight. They will be
   evaluated during EPEs.
3. Precision Approach: Both a Precision Approach Radar (PAR) and an ILS must be evaluated if
   equipment and facilities are available. However, if facilities or equipment are not available, the
   flight evaluation may be completed as long as one precision approach is flown.
4. It may be impractical to evaluate these required items on certain FTU and WIC instructor evalua-
   tion due to student syllabus constraints (e.g., BFM mission checks). Squadron commanders may
   approve these exceptions on a limited basis to validate instructor effectiveness. Document in the
   Comments portion of the AF IMT-8.
5. Annotate by Hit/Miss per event.
6. Every attempt will be made to evaluate the full instrument penetration and approach. If not avail-
   able due to ATC constraints (i.e. vectored off the approach) an enroute descent/vectors to final
   may be substituted for this requirement at the discretion of the FE. No further documentation on
   the IMT-8 is required.

         3.4.3.1.1. Q. Target acquired on the first attack or, if missed due to difficult target identifica-
         tion features, a successful re-attack was accomplished. For multiple target scenarios, all tar-
         gets were acquired on the first attack or with a successful re-attack.
         3.4.3.1.2. Q-. Late to acquire the target, degraded the initial attack or re-attack. For multiple
         target scenarios, 50 percent or more of the targets were acquired on the first attack or with a
         successful re-attack.
         3.4.3.1.3. U. Target was not acquired. For multiple target scenarios, less than 50 percent of the
         targets were acquired on the first attack or with a successful re-attack.
         A successful re-attack is defined as being within parameters to effectively employ the planned
         weapons against the target.
     3.4.3.2. Area 82--Weapons Employment:
     Note 1: Scoreable Ranges. When weapons deliveries are performed on different ranges during the
     same mission, or like deliveries constituting separate events are performed on the same range, all
     events will be evaluated and the area grade will be predicated upon the criteria below.
     Note 2: Unscoreable Ranges. Hit/miss will be determined by the FE based on impact of the simu-
     lated ordnance (freefall bombs or 30MM) and desired weapons effects for the pass flown.
     Note 3: Simulated releases and/or Maverick passes. Hit/ miss will be determined by the FE based
     on aircraft parameters at release or VTR film.
     Note 4: The FE will determine Hit/Miss by reference to VTR film in cases where unexplained
     weapons delivery misses occur (e.g. wind shears).
     Note 5: Hit/Miss.
