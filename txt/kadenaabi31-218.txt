                                            Chapter 1

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Introduction. Driving on KAB is a privilege, not a right. It is a privilege that will be taken
away if it is abused. The driving culture on KAB is increasingly a concern due to the large
number of vehicle accidents. Security Forces responds to nearly 1,300 accidents annually. In
most instances these are minor accidents. However, too many are major accidents caused by the
failure of drivers to obey the rules of the road. Additionally, there are numerous reported
instances of personnel violating traffic safety standards by speeding, failing to yield or obey
traffic signals, and other posted signs. Too many drivers pose a safety threat to themselves and
others on the road, to include school children, joggers, pedestrians, and bicyclists.
1.2. Program Management. This instruction implements policy, assigns responsibility, and
establishes procedures for motor vehicle operations and traffic supervision for KAB and assigned
jurisdictional areas as listed in USFJI 31-203. This includes, but is not limited to, expansion on
the contents of Marine Corps Bases Japan Order (MCBJO) P11240.3 series, Army Regulation
(AR) 190-5, Operational Navy (OPNAV) 11200.5C, AFI 31-218(I) and Defense Logistics
Agency Regulation (DLAR) 5720.1.
1.3. Responsibilities. The provisions of this instruction are in compliance with AFI 31-218(I),
AFMAN 31-116, AFI 91-207, The US Air Force Traffic Safety Program, USFJI 31-203, and
USFJI 31-205.
1.4. Delegation of Authority. The Installation Commander designates, via this instruction, the
18th Mission Support Group Deputy Commander (18 MSG/CD) or equivalent as the Base
Traffic Review Officer (BTRO), representative for traffic supervision matters, SoFA licensing
issuing authority, suspension authority, revocation authority, approving authority for all limited
driving requests, and approving authority for re-instatement of suspended or revoked licenses.
The 18 MSG/CD, acting as the BTRO, is the final authority for all license and driving issues
concerning personnel assigned or attached to the 18th Wing, working, residing or visiting KAB.
The 18 MSG/CD acts as the Installation Commander’s representative to identify high-risk
drivers and authorize the issuance of Suspension and Revocation Letters concerning traffic
offenders. The 18th Mission Support Group Commander (18 MSG/CC) will fill this position
during the absence of a military or civilian deputy. In addition, the following is delegated:
   1.4.1. The 18 MSG/CD has been delegated special licensing consideration authority for non-
   SoFA personnel to drive “ON-BASE ONLY” in accordance with (IAW) USFJI 31-205,
   paragraph 2.2.4. An “ON-BASE ONLY” license may only be issued to family members,
   step parents, or guardians authorized to use base facilities. This special application should be
   granted on the basis of hardships imposed on members or their families by illness,
   deployments, temporary duty or extenuating circumstances deemed reasonable by the 18
   MSG/CD.        Requests for special licensing consideration should be forwarded via
   memorandum format through the Security Forces Pass and Registration Office. Personnel
   granted this special consideration must complete the installation driver’s safety course prior
   to driving or receiving the license. This license will be stamped “ON-BASE ONLY” at the
   time of issue.

    1.4.2. Kadena Disciplinary Action Program Hearing Officer (KDAPHO) or designee serves
    as the presiding authority during any disciplinary action involving all civilian and dependent
    misconduct on KAB IAW 18 WGI 31-201, Kadena Disciplinary Action Program (KDAP).
    Regardless of the action imposed by the KDAP Manager, 18 MSG/CD retains the authority
    as the suspending or revoking authority on KAB.
    1.4.3. The Pass and Registration Office has been designated as the approval official for
    group visits requiring a vehicle pass IAW Kadena AB Instruction (KADENAABI) 31-101,
    Integrated Defense.
    1.4.4. In accordance with Marine Corps Bases Japan Order P11240.3, the US Marine Corps
    is the Executive Agency for all vehicle registration requirements, located at Camp Foster,
    Joint Services Vehicle Registration Office (JSVRO). By virtue of registration, personnel are
    subject to the provisions of MCBJO P11240.3 in addition to this instruction.
    1.4.5. Squadron commanders, agency chiefs or first sergeants are permitted internal
    suspension authority to issue suspensions up to 30 days maximum when an assigned military
    or civilian member or their dependent accumulates sufficient points or commits an infraction
    identified in Table 5.1. Unit commanders, first sergeants or agency chiefs must notify the
    on-call SJA when issuing these suspensions. Any suspensions or combinations thereof over
    30 days must be referred to 18 MSG/CD.
       1.4.5.1. The unit commander, agency chief or first sergeant will implement a system to
       track internal suspensions. Requests for limited driving privileges will be handled IAW
       “Limited Driving Privileges” as outlined in Chapter 5.

     for a maximum of 30 days, the driving privileges of their personnel (active duty,
     contractors, civilian employees and their dependents) they perceive as “high risk.” The
     driving privileges of high-risk personnel can be suspended in order to maintain good
     order discipline and public safety.
        2.6.1.4.1. High risk may be defined as receiving a citation for reckless driving, high
        speed, or inattentive driving. It may also include, but not be limited to, unsafe acts in
        a GOV or POV. Ultimately, the unit commander will have complete discretion in
        determining “high-risk” actions. The high-risk behaviors must be tied to the
        operation of a motor vehicle or motorcycle.
        2.6.1.4.2. The suspension must be in writing and the memorandum must include the
        reason for suspension, length of suspension, and a statement explaining whether the
        suspension applies both on- and off base. If all driving privileges are suspended, the
        individual’s unit will confiscate the driver’s permit of the person and keep it until the
        suspension has terminated. Unit commanders, first sergeants or agency chiefs must
        notify the on-call SJA when issuing these suspensions. The unit commander may
        reinstate the driving privileges of the member before the end of the suspension if
        circumstances warrant.
        2.6.1.4.3. After the 30-day period, the unit commander must terminate the suspension
        or submit a package through the Reports and Analysis Office for approval by the 18
        MSG/CD in order to extend the suspension.
     2.6.1.5. Notification of Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges: When
     circumstances warrant an individual’s driving privileges to be suspended or revoked, a
     letter will be forwarded from the 18 SFS/Reports and Analysis office to the individual’s
     commander. The memorandum is forwarded on behalf of the Installation Commander
     through his designee (18 MSG/CD) notifying the unit commander (or staff agency chief
     and 18 CPTS/CC for wing staff agencies) and first sergeant (if applicable) of suspension
     actions IAW this instruction.
        2.6.1.5.1. This letter applies to military/civilian and/or family members, and
        contractors. The memorandum will include the reason for the suspension, length of
        suspension, and a statement explaining the suspension applies both on and off base.
        Additionally, the letter will include information on due process and scheduling a
        hearing.
        2.6.1.5.2. Commanders will ensure the affected driver is notified immediately and
        will instruct them to report to the Reports and Analysis Office to acknowledge the
        order. If the individual is TDY or on leave, the individual will report to the Reports
        and Analysis Office within 7-calendar days upon return, to acknowledge the order.
        Note: Individuals will be entered into the Defense Biometric Identification System
KADENAABI31-218 29 JANUARY 2014                                                                 13


          (DBIDS) with instructions to report to the Reports and Analysis office to
          acknowledge the suspension/revocation.
       2.6.1.6. Operators involved in alcohol related driving incidents will be processed IAW
       paragraph 4.6
   2.6.2. Revocation of Driving Privileges:
       2.6.2.1. The circumstances which warrant revocation of an individual’s driving
       privileges are listed in, but not limited to, paragraph 2.5.8, and 2.5.15 through 2.5.18 and
       Table 5.1 Furthermore, the installation commander or designated representative will also
       revoke driving privileges for not less than 1 year when it is determined a serious incident
       involving a motor vehicle has occurred and the revocation of driving privileges is
       required to preserve public safety or the good order and discipline of military personnel.
       2.6.2.2. When an individual’s driving privileges have been revoked and the USFJ Form
       4EJ has been confiscated, all vehicles registered to that individual will be deregistered at
       JSVRO IAW Marine Corps Bases Japan Order 11340.1B or superseding instruction
       within 10-duty days. This does not apply to unit commander directed suspensions. The
       following exceptions may be made:
          2.6.2.2.1. When the owner has been granted restricted driving privileges, the vehicle
          need not be deregistered; however, prior to operating any POV, the owner must report
          to JSVRO for a temporary pass.
          2.6.2.2.2. In cases where the spouse or family members are authorized to drive, the
          vehicle need not be deregistered; however, the sponsor will submit a written request
          for a “Spouse/Dependent Only” vehicle pass, endorsed by their unit commander,
          agency chief or first sergeant. If approved, the pass must be displayed on the vehicle.
       2.6.2.3. Personnel who are not granted restricted driving privileges must make
       arrangements to sell, transfer, or properly dispose of (deregister) their vehicle within 30
       days of being notified of disapproval. For non-SoFA personnel, their vehicle must only
       be deregistered from military installations through JSVRO.
       2.6.2.4. Local nationals whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked will
       not receive their confiscated vehicle sticker or temporary pass back. This will be sent to
       JSVRO for deregistration.
       2.6.2.5. The foregoing action does not apply to spouses or dependents that are without
       registration privileges and whose driving privileges are revoked. Ensuring that a spouse
       or dependent does not drive without an operator’s permit is the responsibility of the
       sponsor.
   2.6.3. Multiple suspensions/revocations will run consecutively.
2.7. Reciprocal Procedures. IAW USFJI 31-205, the Installation Commander or designee (18
MSG/CD) will honor reciprocal suspensions or revocations issued by other installation
commanders regardless of service component affiliation. Revocations remain in effect during
reassignment unless the issuing authority terminates the revocation before reassignment.
Anyone with suspended or revoked privileges may petition for restricted (partial or limited)
driving privileges.

   2.7.1. For off-base suspension and revocation requests, IAW USFJI 31-205, upon receipt of
   written notice from Japanese authorities, the Installation Commander or designee (18
   MSG/CD) with coordination of 18 WG/JA will initially suspend or revoke both GOV and
   POV driving privileges pending final resolution of the host nation case.
2.8. Administration Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations. Members who are cited
for violations that result in a loss of driving privileges will be afforded due process except as
specified below. Affected members will have 7-calendar days from notification to request a
hearing to the Base Traffic Review Officer (BTRO) prior to a final decision being made on
revocation of driving privileges. Affected drivers may waive the right to a hearing (in writing) at
any time during the 7-day period and begin the suspension or revocation period. After the
hearing, the BTRO will have 3-duty days to render a decision. If the affected member fails to
request a hearing to the BTRO within 7-calendar days, the revocation will automatically become
effective at midnight on the 8th day.
   2.8.1. The following violations will result in an automatic revocation of driving privileges
   with no opportunity for due process:

   2.9.2. If the initial suspension or revocation was based on either of the aforementioned
   substances, the reinstatement letter will include verification of completion of the required
   substance abuse course.
2.10. Restoring Driving Privileges. All reinstatements from a suspension or revocation will be
requested in writing and processed through the Reports and Analysis Office. Suspensions or
revocations administered through the individual’s unit will be reinstated through the individual’s
unit.
   2.10.1. Driving privileges will be automatically restored when an official report or finding
   determines lack of evidence, not guilty or when charges are dismissed or reduced to an
   offense not meeting the suspension or revocation criteria.

   command, and endorsed by the USMC (Camp Foster) and Army (Torii Station) Provost
   Marshall’s Office (PMO) to the 18 SFS Reports & Analysis office. The letter must be
   accompanied by a copy of the memo for completion of Course V if the privileges were
   restricted due to negative driving behavior, or a copy of the memo for completion of the
   appropriate substance abuse program for the offender’s specific military branch for alcohol
   related incidents. Coordination with other branches is mandated. Sister services maintain
   various procedures, databases, and documents and may offer additional information,
   potentially altering the restoration decisions. Provision also applies to members and
   dependents of other branches who are not a resident on Kadena.
   2.10.3. If the suspension or revocation was based on an accumulation of 12 traffic points
   within 12 consecutive months, or 18 traffic points within 24 consecutive months, the
   reinstatement letter will also include verification of completion of Course V, Driver
   Improvement Course, conducted by 18 WG/SE. Completion of Course V, Driver
   Improvement Course is not required when the initial suspension or revocation was for an
   alcohol related offense.

   18 MSG/CD may authorize limited driving privileges to those whose authority to drive on
   military installations was suspended or revoked by the 18 WG. The individual’s license
   (civilian state, international, host nation, etc.) must not be revoked/expired during this time.
   2.11.2. Restricted driving privilege requests for suspensions of 30 days or less will not be
   honored, except for emergency situations only, i.e. single parent, spouse deployed, or severe
   medical condition.

   (or 18 CPTS/CC for wing staff agencies) and processed through the Reports and Analysis
   Office within 10-duty days of notification of the suspension/revocation determination.
   Failure to submit within 10-duty days constitutes forfeiture of the request.

       3.1.5.1. Temporary Vehicle Pass: Will be issued through JSVRO in lieu of military
       registration to designate specific driver restrictions imposed upon registrant. In cases
       where restriction to the driving privileges of a registrant is imposed by a unit commander,
       agency chief, first sergeant, a traffic court officer, or other authorized official, the
       registrant’s motor vehicle registration will be cancelled. The military registration and all
       military registration decals will be surrendered for a temporary vehicle pass with
       annotated restrictions. Surrender of registration media must be accomplished within 3-
       duty days.
       3.1.5.2. USFJ registrants will be issued a temporary vehicle pass to operate a leased or
       rented vehicle that displays non-SoFA numbered license plates in lieu of their own motor
       vehicle that is undergoing maintenance or repair. Leased, rented or loaned vehicle
       temporary passes may be issued in 30-day increments. Active-duty military personnel, in
       conjunction with official orders, will utilize their common access card (CAC), along with
       a copy of the orders, to gain access to KAB. A temporary vehicle pass is not required.
          3.1.5.2.1. The number of temporary vehicle passes issued will not exceed or
          authorize the registrant to exceed the total number of motor vehicle(s) authorized.
          3.1.5.2.2. 18 SFS may only issue passes valid for KAB or jurisdictional areas.

       pass for non-SoFA vehicles: USFJ Form 4EJ/International Driver’s License for non-
       SoFA personnel, Japanese title, JCI and PDI. Applicants must also provide written
       approval, translated into English, from the leasing/rental agency specifying to whom the
       vehicle is to be loaned and the duration of the intended use. Note: IAW USFJI 31-205,
       para 4.3.2.2, “Treat rental vehicles as GOVs when used for official business by Military
       or DoD personnel.”
3.2. Registration.
   3.2.1. Personnel desiring to operate vehicles on Okinawa must meet registration
   requirements as outlined in AFI 31-218(I), USFJI 31-205, and MCBJO P11240.3. Personnel
   desiring registration must contact JSVRO for specific requirements.
   3.2.2. Temporary Registration. Temporary license plates may be issued for vehicle
   registration processing of vehicles with expired JCI or title. The Road Transportation Law of
   Japan prohibits the use of temporary plates for any other purpose than correcting vehicle
   registration discrepancies. This prohibition includes travel to and from work. Security
   Forces or other military police agencies may remove temporary plates and impound vehicles
   parked in unauthorized parking spaces. Security Forces may also remove the temporary plate
   if the registration is expired and impound the vehicle. US Forces personnel who desire to
   drive a newly imported vehicle from the port of entry to their place of assignment must
   obtain temporary license plates from JSVRO authorities and affix these plates to the vehicle
   before departing from the port. Insurance coverage is required to complete temporary
   registration. When utilizing the temporary plates for inspection purposes, the temporary
   plate must be placed on the vehicle where it is clearly visible. Issued plates must not be

  JSVRO will provide guidance on temporary license plates at the time of issue.
  3.2.3. Temporary license plates are good for 3-calendar days or until 1800 on Saturday,
  whichever occurs first. The day of issue is always counted as the first day, regardless of the
  time of day the plates are obtained.
  3.2.4. A monetary deposit is required to use temporary license plates. Failure to return the
  plates within 1-duty day after the expiration will result in forfeiture of the deposit. Also,

  the plates are lost or damaged, a replacement cost will be assessed. Cost information may be
  obtained from JSVRO.
     3.2.4.1. Temporary license plates are issued for the following reasons: the vehicle
     registration has expired or the vehicle has never been registered in Japan. The vehicle

         of Title of Motor Vehicle.
         3.2.5.2.3. Provide the registrant with USFJ Form 15A or B, Vehicle Registration
         Decals and other decals as required by rank and/or circumstance. The issuance of
         this form will be based upon having the correct documents as listed above.
  3.2.6. US Forces personnel must present privately owned vehicles, cars, trucks, motorcycles,
  and trailers, to which they have title, possession, or custody to GoJ authorities for inspection,
  registration, and to obtain GoJ license plates prior to operating them on any roadway. If a

   identification card/credential.
   3.2.8. POVs of US Forces personnel, civilians, or their command-sponsored dependents will
   not be granted routine access to US Forces facilities and areas unless the vehicles have been
   registered IAW USFJI 31-205, MCBJO P11240.3, and this instruction. This includes
   receiving temporary vehicle passes in an effort to avoid registration requirements when the
   registered owner has been granted SoFA status.
   3.2.9. Official Vehicles (OV). The 18 MSG/CD is authorized to approve government
   agencies use of OV plates for mission related activities. These vehicles will not be operated
   for personal use or benefit of the operator or passenger. The only exception to this is non-

       the vehicle. A license plate must be attached to the front and rear bumpers of the vehicle.
       Two-wheeled vehicles and trailers only require one rear license plate. When these plates
       have become illegible or difficult to read, new plates must be obtained.
       3.3.1.2. Retouching, repainting, or modifying license plates is strictly prohibited.
       License plates must be the originals assigned by GoJ Land Transportation Office and
       clearly visible, free of debris, mud, dirt, covers, without any bends or folds, and mounted
       horizontally (as not to avoid highway camera systems). After-market lighted license
       plate number cutouts are prohibited on KAB. AAFES New Car Sales vehicles must have
       an assigned OV plate when driven on the roadway. AAFES vehicles may also be test
       driven by customers who have SOFA status. Seals placed on the back license plate by
       GoJ Land Transportation Office personnel will not be removed or tampered with.
       Removal or tampering will result in the vehicle being impounded by Security Forces,
       military authorities, GoJ Police or JSVRO personnel. In lieu of impoundment, Security
       Forces may issue the violator a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket. Vehicles

   applies:
       3.4.1.1. The Pass and Registration Office, on-duty Security Forces personnel, and
       JSVRO have been identified as the “temporary” vehicle registration offices and are
       limited to issuing AF Form 75, vehicle pass, for short periods of time as specified in this
       instruction.
       3.4.1.2. No other agency will issue KAB Installation entry control passes, other than the
       agencies identified above without prior approval of the 18 SFS/CC or 18 MSG/CD.
3.5. Specifications for USFJ Registration.
   3.5.1. The JSVRO located on Camp Foster is the office of primary responsibility for the
   issuance of USFJ Form 15A and 15B. The decal serves as proof of motor vehicle
   registration for US Forces personnel.

                            TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES

4.1. Traffic Planning. Japanese traffic and vehicle safety laws are strictly enforced on KAB.
Additional traffic laws and penalties are listed in Table 5.1 of this instruction.
   4.1.1. 18th Civil Engineer Group Commander (18 CEG/CC) and Traffic Safety Coordination
   Group (TSCG), develops traffic circulation plans prior to base events and construction that
   would impact normal traffic flow to provide for the safest and most efficient use of primary
   and secondary roadways. The TSCG consults with highway engineering representatives
   from the Japanese community to ensure the installation plan is compatible with plans
   developed by the host nation and the surrounding local community.
       4.1.1.1. Modifications or adjustments to the traffic flow program on KAB must be
       coordinated with the Defense Force Commander (DFC) or designee.
4.2. Installation Traffic Codes.
   4.2.1. These provisions apply to all persons who operate motor vehicles, bicycles (including
   non-motorized vehicles operated upon roadways) and all pedestrians on KAB or any area
   under the control and jurisdiction of the Installation Commander or as listed in USFJI 31-203
   and USFJI 31-205. The goal of the installation traffic code is to outline the rules of the road
   for vehicle operators. The 18th Security Forces Squadron performs the missions of directing,
   controlling, and enforcing traffic rules and of ensuring vehicles, materials, and personnel
   flow safely and efficiently over roadways under Air Force control or KAB jurisdictional
   boundaries IAW established procedures and rules of the road. Personnel violating these
   codes or rules may be issued a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, by Security
   Forces personnel or may be apprehended as authorized.
   4.2.2. On-scene Security Forces directing traffic, or other personnel properly trained by
   Security Forces to include school crossing guards, have precedence over written regulations
   and traffic signs or signals. In the absence of Security Forces or other authorized personnel
   conducting traffic control, the traffic signs or signals of paragraphs 4.2.7 through 4.2.7.9 will
   apply.
   4.2.3. Heavy, Oversized or Special Equipment.
       4.2.3.1. Vehicle operators must observe all base speed limits. If heavy equipment (e.g.,
       front end loaders, cranes, forklifts, Military-Field Series vehicles have lights and turn
       signals, they do not have to be escorted unless they are wider than one lane of traffic or
       interfere with the normal flow of traffic. The sponsoring agency will coordinate with
       Security Forces prior to movement to help determine the best route and time to conduct
       the move. The sponsoring agency or equipment operators will provide personnel
       necessary to facilitate safe movement and traffic control.
   4.2.4. Golf Cart/Utility Type Vehicles/Equipment.
       4.2.4.1. The use of golf carts and 3 or 4-wheeled maintenance vehicles (utility type) is
       normally restricted to non-roadway areas. This is because they are relatively slow and
       difficult for motorists to see. These vehicles are currently authorized on the flight line,
24                                                  KADENAABI31-218 29 JANUARY 2014


     golf courses, Civil Engineer (CE) shop areas, 18th Force Support Squadron (18 FSS)
     recreational areas and other similar areas. Should organizations have a requirement to
     operate these vehicles on open roadways, they must submit a request to 18 WG/SE with
     justification unless used in conjunction with base sponsored events, e.g. America Fest,
     Okinawa Marathon, etc. The Safety Office will evaluate the request IAW AFI 91-207 to
     ensure all safety requirements are met. Note: These motorized vehicles are classified as
     equipment; therefore, damages associated with accidents, mishaps and incidents do not
     warrant traditional Security Forces traffic accident investigation, but may warrant a
     Report of Survey IAW AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property, by
     owner/user organizations.
  4.2.5. Vehicle operators will maintain positive control of their vehicles at all times, ensuring
  the safety of lives and property on or near roadways. When other factors such as weather,
  heavy traffic, accidents, or road conditions require a slower speed limit, vehicle operators are
  required to travel at a safe speed consistent with the hazard, regardless of the posted speed
  limit. Vehicle operators are expected to devote their complete attention to driving the vehicle
  safely and will abide by traffic rules as follows:
     4.2.5.1. Vehicles will be operated only in the left lane (traveling lane or lane #1) of the
     roadway except when overtaking, passing in a passing zone, on a multi-lane roadway or
     when the left half of the roadway is under construction or unobstructed and safe
     movement in the right lane is possible.
     4.2.5.2. Maintain a safe distance between vehicles while traveling upon the roadway to
     ensure adequate braking distance as specified below:
         4.2.5.2.1. Vehicle operators will maintain 10 feet of distance for every 10 kilometers
         per hour (KPH), e.g., a vehicle traveling at 60 KPH will maintain a safe distance of at
         least 60 feet or at least three car lengths from the vehicle in front.
     4.2.5.3. Left turns will be made from as near to the left side of the roadway as possible.
     4.2.5.4. Yield right-of-way to bicyclists traveling to the far-left lane adjacent to the curb,
     when vehicles are turning left.
     4.2.5.5. Make appropriate hand-and-arm or mechanical turn signals for at least 100 feet
     before making a turn off a roadway.
     4.2.5.6. Make certain a safe route of travel exists before entering the flow of traffic from
     a stopped position.
     4.2.5.7. Yield right-of-way to vehicles traveling on a primary or main roadway or a
     clearly larger roadway when entering from an unmarked intersection, road, alley or
     driveway.
     4.2.5.8. Yield right-of-way to vehicles on the left at unmarked intersections. At four-
     way stops yield right-of-way to the first vehicle stopped. If it is unclear as to which
     vehicle stopped first, be courteous and use prudent judgment to motion the other driver to
     proceed. Ensure all vehicle operators acknowledge the hand signal to proceed prior to
     moving.
     4.2.5.9. Obey all temporary road construction signs/flagmen. Temporary construction

         vehicle. Note: Owners are responsible for all towing charges if performed by a
         civilian agency. Failure to pay tow charges may warrant pay garnishment until the
         amount of the debt is recovered. The vehicle will remain on hold or impounded until
         full payment is made.
  4.2.12. Defective, noncompliant, or illegally modified vehicles. It is unlawful for any person
  to drive or move, or for the owner to cause or knowingly permit to be driven or moved, on

  with such lamps and other equipment in proper condition and adjustment and to constitute an
  unsafe condition, or which is equipped in any manner in violation of this instruction or
  MCBJO P11240.3. USFJ personnel are prohibited from physically modifying or altering
  their vehicle in a manner which changes the original manufacturer’s design (e.g., serial
  number, tires, suspension, steering wheel, timing, parking lamps, exhaust system, etc.) after
  completing the GoJ/JCI vehicle inspection.
     4.2.12.1. Vehicle owners/operators with defective, noncompliant, or illegally modified
     vehicles will be issued a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, and instructed to
     correct the violation. Individuals will also be instructed to maintain a copy of the ticket
     with the vehicle until the correction is made, and will present the ticket to any Security
     Forces member if subsequently stopped for the same violation within 5-duty days.
     Security Forces personnel will not issue an additional ticket for the same vehicle defect if
     the operator presents a previous citation and is still within the 5-duty-day window. Unit
     commanders, agency chiefs, or first sergeants are responsible for ensuring owners correct
     defective, noncompliant or illegally modified vehicles. Anyone who cannot comply
     within 5-duty days must not drive the vehicle or they may be issued subsequent Armed
     Forces Traffic Tickets.
     4.2.12.2. Vehicle owners will notify JSVRO whenever they alter any vehicle in any way.
     Altering any vehicle includes installation of suspension lift kits, lowering kits, re-painting
     the vehicle a different color, painting non-offensive designs, or any other modification
     that alters the performance or appearance of the vehicle. Modifications that do not fit this
     definition would include trailer hitches, cargo racks (bicycle, luggage, or surf board
     racks), or running boards. When in doubt, it is best to contact JSVRO for final decision
     on the modification. If the modification has not been approved by JSVRO in writing, it is
     subject to being ticketed and, if necessary, the vehicle may be impounded. The written
     approval from JSVRO must be kept with the vehicle at all times.

     not require a detailed investigation. Alleged injuries not reported at the accident scene
     but subsequently treated or reported will not change the classification of a minor vehicle
     accident to a major vehicle accident. Individuals reporting alleged injuries after the fact
     will be instructed to provide all medical documentation to their insurance companies or
     other agencies requesting the information. Minor motor vehicle accidents, not requiring
     Security Forces response, must be reported to US Forces Law Enforcement agencies as
     soon as possible, but not to exceed 72 hours after the accident. Note: Hit and Run,
     Suspected DUI, and Uninsured Motorist/Drivers warrant Security Forces response.
         4.3.2.1.1. Security Forces will complete a Kadena AB Form 5EJ, Minor Traffic
         Accident Information Sheet (PA). Minor vehicle traffic accidents are also recorded in
         the Security Forces blotter. Once the accident is recorded in the blotter, a copy will
         be routed to and maintained by the Reports and Analysis Office. If an insurance
         company adjuster requires a copy of the blotter entry on a minor vehicle accident,
         they may be provided one on an as-needed basis by the Reports and Analysis Office.
         4.3.2.1.2. Functional Damage. Damage to a vehicle that renders it unsafe or
         impractical to operate safely is considered functional damage rendering the accident
         to be classified as a minor accident. This may include flat or damaged tires, fender
         bent over the tire, or any other limited damage which can be immediately repaired
         causing the vehicle to be operationally safe when fixed. If the damage is so severe
KADENAABI31-218 29 JANUARY 2014                                                                37


           that major repair is needed before the vehicle can be operated safely again, it would
           be classified as having disabling damage and classified as a major accident.
       4.3.2.2. Major. Vehicle accidents consisting of disabling damage, injuries, death, or hard
       to explain, i.e., no correlation to the evidence on hand. Security Forces personnel will

5.2. Traffic Point System. The traffic point system supplements AFI 31-218(I), AFMAN 31-
116 and provides a uniform administrative process to impartially judge driving performance.
This system is not a disciplinary measure or a substitute for punitive action and does not interfere
with the installation commander’s prerogative to issue, suspend, revoke, deny or reinstate
installation-driving privileges IAW AFI 31-218(I), Military Police Motor Vehicle Traffic
Supervision, and USFJI 31-205. Note: No points are assessed for revocation or suspension
actions. This table is not all-inclusive but contains the most common traffic violations
committed and cited for. This table is used as a guide for violations and enforceable in
accordance with this instruction.

   5.2.1. Traffic Citation Rebuttal Process.
       5.2.1.1. When an individual receives a ticket and feels the ticket was unjustly issued, the
       individual can rebut the ticket. The individual must draft a memorandum, specifically
 54                                                KADENAABI31-218 29 JANUARY 2014


      citing evidence that disproves the validity of the ticket within 10-duty days. The
      memorandum and related information can be obtained from the Reports and Analysis
      office at 634-1134/1138/2943. The package will only be submitted after it has been
      completed by the individual and reviewed by Reports and Analysis.
      5.2.1.2. Reports and Analysis will not review or forward ticket rebuttals without a
      memorandum letter endorsed by the violator’s commander or agency chief. If the
      commander or agency chief non-concurs with the ticket rebuttal package it will not be
      processed.
      5.2.1.3. The Reports and Analysis Office will review the rebuttal package and make a
      recommendation to S3 and the DFC as to its validity. If the DFC determines the ticket
      should be voided, the rebuttal process is complete and the individual is notified of the
      action taken through his or her commander, agency chief or first sergeant. If the DFC
      determines the ticket is valid, the ticket will be forwarded to the 18 MSG/CD or designee
      with a recommendation of why the ticket is valid.
      5.2.1.4. 18 MSG/CD or designee will review the rebuttal package and make the final
      determination. The rebuttal package will then be returned to the Reports and Analysis
      Office, who will inform the commander agency chief or first sergeant of the final
      decision.
5.3. Point System Application.
   5.3.1. The Reports and Analysis Office routinely receives notice/reports of off-base traffic
   offenses from all US Forces Japan law enforcement agencies, local GoJ law enforcement
   agencies and CONUS law enforcement agencies. All tickets will be entered into the
   individual’s driving record and based upon the ticket, points will be assessed against the
   individual if they operate a motor vehicle on Kadena AB. In accordance with USFJ 31-205,
   the use of the point system and procedures prescribed herein are mandatory for on and off
   base offenses. The point system applies to civilian personnel (i.e. AAFES, DECA, DoDDS,
   DOD, Dependents, contractors and all other SOFA status civilians) and all military personnel
   operating GOVs, POVs on and off the installation. It applies to all Local Nationals operating
   GOVs and POVs on Kadena AB. The point system will be used for on and off installation
   citations and annotated on the individual’s driving history. When two or more violations are
   written on a single occasion, points may be assessed for each violation. Note: Points are
   assessed from other agencies (both US and Japanese) to ensure drivers operate safely while
   outside the jurisdictional areas applicable to this instruction.
   5.3.2. An advisory letter will be forwarded to the unit commander, agency chief or first
   sergeant on any person who receives a citation on or off installation.
   5.3.3. The Security Forces Liaison Office will coordinate all civil traffic matters with
   18 WG/JA.
5.4. Point System Procedures.
   5.4.1. The Reports and Analysis Office will record traffic violations and assess points
   IAW AFMAN 31-116, AFI 31-218(I), USFJI 31-205, and this instruction in several ways:
      5.4.1.1. AF Form 3545, Incident Report
      5.4.1.2. DD Form 1408.
KADENAABI31-218 29 JANUARY 2014                                                                 55


     5.4.1.3. Kadena AB Form 7, Notification of Traffic Infraction (PA), for off-base
     offenses.
     5.4.1.4. Kadena AB Form 10, Notification of Alleged Offense (PA), for off-base offenses.
  5.4.2. Traffic Complaints. When a traffic complaint is received on an individual, the
  complainant must be willing to provide a written statement. Failure to provide a written
  statement or an adequate description of the vehicle (e.g., color, make, license plate number)
  could result in no action being taken. Once a written statement is obtained, the incident will
  be recorded in the Security Forces blotter. Security Forces Operations personnel will follow
  up on the complaint when sufficient information has been provided. Complaints against
  members of other services will be forwarded to the appropriate agency for follow-up/action,
  if warranted. Complaints against Air Force affiliated personnel will be forwarded to the
  responsible Air Force unit for follow-up/action. If there is sufficient probable cause, Security
  Forces may investigate the complaint and issue a DD Form 1408 to the alleged offender or
  take other actions IAW this instruction. Points will be assessed based on actions taken by
  Security Forces.
     5.4.2.1. Off-Installation Traffic Activities. Security Forces maintain a close liaison with
     Japanese Police agencies, and when possible prompt notifications of offenses are made to
     Security Forces when SoFA vehicle operators are involved in traffic accidents or
     incidents. Japanese Police also provide prompt notice when SoFA vehicle operators are
     involved in or detained for serious violations of Japanese traffic laws. All SoFA
     personnel must provide JP officials their DoD identification (ID) cards and USFJ Form
     4EJ upon request.
     5.4.2.2. Most minor infractions of Japanese Traffic Code do not warrant Security Forces
     notification until after the fact. Note: Points will be assessed for off-base traffic
     infractions.
     5.4.2.3. Personnel receiving the following off-base citations will accomplish the
     following upon coordination with the Staff Judge Advocate (18 WG/SJA):
         5.4.2.3.1. If the violator was given a blue copy of the ticket, payment of the fine is
         the only requirement. The violator has 7 days from the day after the citation is issued
         to pay the fine at a GoJ Bank or Post Office. Note: ALWAYS KEEP THE RECEIPT
         AS PROOF OF PAYMENT.
             5.4.2.3.1.1. Failure to pay the fine within the 7-day time period can result in
             arrest until the fine is paid. If fines cannot be paid within the 7-day period,
             personnel must immediately contact the Security Forces Liaison Office and 18
             WG/JA. Note: If a member wishes to rebut an off-base citation they must do so
             before they pay the fine, for further info contact the 18 SFS/Liaison Office at 634-
             2239.
     5.4.2.4. If a violator receives the white copy of the traffic ticket, the violator must retain
     the ticket until contacted to report to court. The Japanese prosecutor will contact the
     Security Forces Liaison Office which in-turn will contact 18 WG/JA and the unit
     commander, agency chief or first sergeant.
56                                             KADENAABI31-218 29 JANUARY 2014


     5.4.2.4.1. 18 WG/JA will coordinate with the violator’s unit and subsequently place
     the violator on International Hold, pending adjudication. The violator is not
     permitted to depart the island on leave or TDY until the ticket is resolved. SoFA
     personnel requested to attend an interview with the Japanese police must first report
     to the legal office and obtain a briefing outlining the alleged violator’s rights under
     the SoFA.
        5.4.2.4.1.1. 18 WG/JA will provide the Security Forces Liaison Office a monthly
        up to date listing of all personnel placed on International Hold.
     5.4.2.4.2. Japanese Police Ticketing Procedures: The Security Forces Liaison Office
     is notified by the Japanese Police anytime a SoFA member is issued a traffic ticket.
     The Security Forces Liaison Office notifies 18 WG/JA of these infractions via the
     Kadena AB Form 7, Notification of Traffic Infraction (PA), or the Kadena AB Form
     10, Notification of Alleged Offense (PA). The Kadena AB Form 7 and Kadena AB
     Form 10 will be coordinated through the violator’s commander, agency chief or first
     sergeant for action. The commander signs a memorandum letter from the Reports
     and Analysis Office annotating what action was taken on the ticket and returns it to
     the Reports and Analysis Office within 14 days for updating and filing.
     5.4.2.4.3. Armed Forces Traffic Tickets, DD Form 1408. Tickets are forwarded to
     the Reports and Analysis Office for processing and dissemination. Upon receipt of
     the traffic ticket or other law enforcement report, the unit commander, agency chief,
     or first sergeant will conduct an inquiry and take disciplinary action as appropriate.
     The commander signs a memorandum letter from the Reports and Analysis Office
     annotating what action was taken and returns it to the Reports and Analysis Office
     within 14 days for updating and filing.
     5.4.2.4.4. An advisory letter will be forwarded to the unit commander/agency chief
     and first sergeant on any person who receives a citation. When an individual has six
     or more points, the unit should consider whether the driver would benefit from
     attending the Driver Improvement Course IAW AFI 91-207. The course focuses on
     improving behaviors in operational traffic environments and is aimed at those drivers
     who have displayed a trend of poor driving behaviors such as a history of accidents,
     speeding, reckless driving, or poor driving attitudes or knowledge. The Driver
     Improvement Course should not be used as a punishment tool or for personnel that
     lost their driving privileges as a result of an alcohol/drug related driving offense.
     Personnel required to attend the Driver Improvement Course must be scheduled
     through 18 WG/SE, 634-7233/2196.
     5.4.2.4.5. Points assessed against personnel remain active and will be managed IAW
     AFI 31-218(I) and AFMAN 31-116.
     5.4.2.4.6. Removal of points does not authorize removal of driving record entries for
     moving violations, chargeable accidents, suspensions, or revocations. Recorded
     entries will remain posted on individual driving records IAW AFI 31-218(I) and
     AFMAN 31-116.

       refusing to give permission to SF personnel to move their vehicle will have their vehicle
       towed at the owner’s expense.
       6.5.2.2. Security Forces will accomplish a vehicle hold worksheet and identify the exact
       violation(s). Operators will sign and date the hold worksheet acknowledging their
       obligation to comply as instructed. Failure to comply may result in the impoundment of
       their vehicle. A copy of this letter will be provided to the violator at the time of
       processing. Failure to acknowledge the hold letter will result in the vehicle being towed
       and impounded.
       6.5.2.3. All personal property within the vehicle(s) must be removed by the operator at
       the time the vehicle is placed on temporary hold. Signing the 12-hour Suspension/Hold
       Letter indicates acknowledgement that all property within the vehicle was removed and
       Security Forces and JSVIL personnel are not responsible for loss, theft, or damage of any
       property not removed from the vehicle.

towing support to remove vehicles. Security Forces may also use a contracted towing service.
   6.6.1. 18 LRS Vehicle Dispatch may be called to move any disabled vehicle causing
   immediate traffic safety or fire-fighting obstacles on base. This type of support will only be
   requested when an operator/owner is incapable (medical emergency or unable to be
   contacted) of making arrangements for removal. This request is limited to Security Forces,
   fire department, group commanders or higher authority.
   6.6.2. 18 LRS tow truck operators are not liable for any damages incurred to any vehicles
   being towed or removed under these conditions.
       6.6.2.1. Towing will be limited to a nearby parking lot, parking lot of Building #705, or
       Security Forces temporary impound lot. When vehicles are required to be moved, they
       will be parked in the nearest parking lot, or in an authorized parking space until vehicle
       tow or movement can be safely accomplished. The parking lot of Building #705 will be
       used as a temporary towing area for short periods of time, when awaiting tow after
KADENAABI31-218 29 JANUARY 2014                                                          61

Terms
Ability— The physical proximity coupled with the motor skills to put the vehicle in motion by
manipulation of the ignition, gears, and/or release of the emergency brake. A young child being
left unattended in a vehicle could have the ability and physical motor skills to release the
emergency brake and put a vehicle into motion.
Access— The right and privilege to enter or utilize.
AF Form 75, Visitor & Vehicle Pass— Identifies individuals and vehicles not possessing
appropriate Department of Defense (DoD) and installation media. Passes issued from other
installations are not valid. The duration of the pass will coincide with the length of the visit.
The sponsor, not the visitor, determines pass length. Vehicle passes issued by JSVRO are
authorized.
Aggressive/High Risk Driver— The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) defines aggressive driving as “the operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Aggressive driving is a traffic offense,
not a criminal offense.       Aggressive driving manifests itself as a combination of reckless
operating characteristics resulting in highway behavior dangerous to other roadway users, and
aggressive driving contributes to needless losses. These behaviors include a list of “symptoms”
that create serious risk when combined with other variables such as vehicles, other drivers, traffic
congestion, visibility, and road conditions. Some of these aggressive driver behaviors include:
Excessive speeding
Tailgating
Erratic lane—changes
Excessive acceleration and braking
Unsafe passing
Intentional red light running
Passing off the paved portion of highway
Lane change violations
Speeding beyond the traffic flow
Failure to yield at ramps or intersections
 66                                                   KADENAABI31-218 29 JANUARY 2014


Base Traffic Review Officer (BTRO)— The 18th Mission Support Group, Deputy Commander
(18 MSG/CD or equivalent) or in his/her absence, the 18 MSG/CC has been designated as the
BTRO by the 18 WG/CC.
Drunk/Impaired— Any intoxication that is sufficient to impair the rational and full exercise of
the mental or physical faculties. The term drunk is used in relation to intoxication by alcohol.
The term impaired is used in relation to intoxication by other substances other than alcohol.
Entry Authority List (EAL)— Authenticated, typewritten, chronological (e.g. alphabetized)
source document identifying guests by full name, destination and the inclusive period during
which access is required. The sponsor assumes responsibility for the conduct and actions of their
guests while on the installation. EALs are designed to give access to individuals, not their
privately owned vehicles. If vehicle access is required, the sponsor will annotate and verify the
visitor meets insurance requirements.
Japanese Compulsory Insurance (JCI)— Required by Article 5 of the Automobile Liability
Security Law of Japan. JCI provides personal injury type coverage with limits. Under this law,
no automobile may be driven until the owner shows proof of the compulsory insurance. It does
not cover any liability for any property a vehicle operator might damage by operating a motor
vehicle.
Minor—Vehicle accidents with functional damage estimated at $20,000 or less of damages
(combined) and no injuries. Although minor vehicle accidents are classified as a reported
accident, they do not require a detailed investigation. The Security Forces patrolman does,
however, have the discretion whether or not to issue a DD Form 1408 if the situation warrants.
Monetary compensation is handled privately through the vehicle operators’ insurance companies.
Alleged injuries not reported at the accident scene but subsequently treated or reported will not
change the classification of a minor vehicle accident to a major vehicle accident. Individuals
reporting alleged injuries after the fact will be instructed to provide all medical documentation to
their insurance companies or other agencies requesting the information. Minor motor vehicle
accidents, not involving Security Forces response, must be reported to US Forces Law
Enforcement agencies as soon as possible, but no longer than 72 hours after the accident. Note:
Hit & Run, Suspected DUI, Uninsured Motorist/Drivers warrant SF response.
Major— Vehicle accidents estimated at $20,000 or more (combined), disabling damage (above),
injuries, death, or hard to explain, i.e., no correlation to the evidence on-hand. Responding
Security Forces patrols can either cite a vehicle operator at fault on the scene, if evidence is
obvious, or later after the investigation is completed. For major accidents, Security Forces has a
