                                            Chapter 1

                          ESTABLISHMENT AND MEMBERSHIP

1.1. Purpose. Clubs provide customer-driven food, beverage, entertainment, and other
membership programs to meet the social recreation needs of members and their authorized
guests. Clubs support the Air Force community by serving as the primary location for
commanders to host official social functions and community relations events. Clubs provide an
informal location for commanders, command chief master sergeants, first sergeants, supervisors,
and other leaders to create an environment that fosters and promotes Air Force institutional
values. The Air Force Catering Program operated by clubs is the primary source for on-base
catering. Eligible personnel who decline membership will not receive membership benefits.
1.2. Club Configurations. There are four types of Air Force club configurations; officers’ club
(OC), enlisted club (EC), collocated club (COLC), and consolidated club (COC). Advance
approval of the Headquarters United States Air Force, Director of Services (HQ USAF/ILV) is
required for any change in club configuration. See paragraph 1.3.2 for information to include in
reconfiguration requests. Collocation of officer and enlisted programs in the same facility (under
one roof) is the standard configuration for Air Force clubs. Facility layout will be conducive to
providing entertainment programs and special function service simultaneously.
    1.2.1. In collocated clubs, maintain separate bars for officers and enlisted members.
    1.2.2. In collocated clubs, combined dining service is the most effective method, unless the
    market demand supports separate dining areas.
    1.2.3. Kitchens and serving areas, cashier services, and special function areas (ballroom,
    meeting rooms) will be available for use by all members/ranks.
    1.2.4. When a single building is not adequate to accommodate the entire collocated club
    market, an annex may be used. Club annexes must have prior approval of HQ USAF/ILV.
    Programs at the main club and the annex must each be self-sustaining, and with the exception
    of bars, must be open to members of all ranks.
    1.2.5. The consolidated club configuration may be used only in very unusual circumstances,
    i.e., when the market demand or unit size will not support separate bar activities.
    1.2.6. A stand-alone configuration (separate club programs for officer and enlisted
    personnel) may be offered provided sufficient market demand exists to assure profitable
    operations, adequate member programs, and continued customer service. Under this
    configuration, commanders should maximize efficiencies using combined support functions
    (administration, cashier services, catering, personnel utilization, etc.) or by establishing
    certain programs (e.g. brunch, breakfast) as joint-use and offering them in only one facility.
1.3. Establishing Clubs. Advance approval from HQ USAF/ILV is required when the
installation commander desires to establish a new club.
    1.3.1. Send requests to establish a new club or change an existing club configuration to the
    MAJCOM, Director of Services (MAJCOM/SV) who will send it with comments to HQ
    USAF/ILV for approval with an information copy to HQ AFSVA/SVOC. Coordinate
AFI34-272 1 APRIL 2002                                                                          5


   establishing a club with Headquarters Air Force Services Agency, Director of Financial
   Management and Comptroller (HQ AFSVA/SVF) for accounting procedures.
   1.3.2. Requests must include anticipated number of members; facility description
   information (location, construction type, condition code, and size in square feet); amount and
   source of nonappropriated funds (NAF) required for initial operation and equipment; and an
   initial financial plan that includes a 5-year capital requirements budget, the first year’s
   income and expense (I&E) budget, and an opening and a business plan (use the Club
   Opening Plan published by HQ AFSVA/SVOC for guidance in preparing the opening and
   business plan).
   1.3.3. To establish a club, the installation commander secures appropriated funds (APF) in
   accordance with AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare and Recreation
   Programs and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities; approves local club policies and
   house rules; notifies the MAJCOM/SV of NAFs required for initial operation and equipment;
   and requests assistance in submitting any necessary application for MAJCOM or Air Force
   grants (see AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds, will convert to AFI 34-403).
   Accepts contributions and donations according to AFIs 34-201 (will convert to AFI 34-403)
   and 34-209, Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting (will convert to
   AFI 34-409).
1.4. Contracting-Out Clubs. Requests to contract-out any portion of club operations must be
approved by HQ USAF/ILV. Coordinate contracting-out a club with HQ AFSVA/SVF for
accounting procedures.
1.5. Dissolving a Club. HQ USAF/ILV approves dissolving a club. Coordinate dissolving a
club with HQ AFSVA/SVF for accounting procedures. The Services Squadron commander or
division chief provides the following information through the MAJCOM/SV a minimum of 90
days before the proposed closing date.
   1.5.1. Why the club is being dissolved. If it is because the club is unprofitable, describe all
   measures taken to turn a profit.
   1.5.2. The club’s financial condition in the current month, the past quarter, the year-to-date,
   and the previous fiscal year.
   1.5.3. The plan for disposing of club facilities and assets.
   1.5.4. The plan to satisfy installation food, beverage, catering, and protocol function
   requirements.
   1.5.5. The proposed future use for each club facility.

   which permanently assigned. Retirees who elect to join a club must join the club closest to
   their domicile.
   EXCEPTIONS:
      1.7.1.1. Personnel on TDY, who are not club members, may join the club at their TDY
      location. The club manager verifies TDY status with a copy of the individual's orders.
      Use the standard Air Force club membership application to process memberships for
      TDY personnel. Transfer these members to the club at their home base upon completion
      of the TDY.
      1.7.1.2. Personnel permanently assigned to one base and residing on another base may
      choose membership at either base.
   1.7.2. Eligible persons who have not joined the club may attend mandatory, official military
   functions held at the club, (example: commander’s call). The installation commander may
   allow eligible nonmembers to use certain club facilities (example: lunch), or participate in
   specifically designated functions (example: wing parties). Whenever the commander
   extends the hospitality of the club to eligible nonmembers, the nonmember pricing applies to
   any food, beverages or services purchased.
   1.7.3. When both spouses are eligible for club membership, the higher ranking spouse joins
   the club at the base of assignment, and the other spouse receives spouse privileges, even if
   assigned to a different base. Spouses may elect to obtain separate individual memberships.
      1.7.3.1. If one spouse is eligible for the officers' club and the other is eligible for the
      enlisted club, each must join and pay dues in the appropriate club if they elect to be
      members.
      1.7.3.2. If both spouses are not eligible for membership in the same club, the non-eligible
      spouse may only use the other club when accompanied by the member spouse. The non-
      eligible spouse, if military, must not be in uniform on unofficial occasions.
   1.7.4. Individuals eligible for membership in both the officers' and enlisted clubs may join
   either or both clubs (see paragraph 1.13.4 below).
8                                                                     AFI34-272 1 APRIL 2002


1.8. Membership Cards. A standard Air Force-wide club membership card is issued to all
members through the services of a contract financial institution. In accordance with terms of the

   1.12.2. MAJCOMs or bases may increase the above minimum nonmember rates, add
   additional nonmember charges for services not addressed above, and restrict club services
   available to eligible nonmembers.
   1.12.3. A bona fide guest(s) is a person or persons, not eligible for club membership, whom
   a member personally and specifically invites to accompany the member or the member’s

   counterparts. Bases have the option to charge less than 50 percent if desired.
   1.13.3. Waive club membership dues for personnel during deployment to a contingency
   location for 30 days or more, where there is no Air Force club. Accomplish this by either
   placing the member in a ―no-dues‖ status for the duration of the deployment, or by providing
   coupons equivalent to the dues paid during the deployment for use at the home base.
   1.13.4. Bases may offer people eligible for membership in both the enlisted and officers’

March and 30 September. This data transfer will include membership information for each club,
and each MAJCOM by club configuration. MAJCOMs pass this membership information to
their bases.
1.15. Payment Terminals. A club bill Payment Terminal is required for each club in order to
provide a standard benefit and convenience to members. There is no requirement to increase
cashier service hours or the number of cashiers. Using the Payment Terminal can drastically
reduce late payments, especially in locations where mail is subject to periodic delays.
   1.15.1. Do not charge a fee for using the Payment Terminal.
10                                                                  AFI34-272 1 APRIL 2002


     1.15.2. Establish a limit on payments made by check at an amount equal to the local check-
     cashing limit. If the member’s minimum monthly payment exceeds the local payment limit,
     management may approve the exception in the same manner as exceptions to the check
     cashing limit. There is no limit on cash payments.

     contract for the items needed.
3.14. Beverage Operations. The club manager establishes operating procedures, and ensures
required internal controls are in place. Provide a variety of non-alcoholic and alcoholic
beverages to meet members’ needs. A beverage menu must be available to customers in bars

     alcoholic beverages from the best source considering price, item availability, minimum order
     requirements, and delivery.
     3.14.2. The club manager ensures all employees serving and selling alcoholic beverages
     receive initial and annual training in dram shop theory, alcohol abuse awareness, alcohol
     deglamorization, and the Air Force Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) Prevention Program.
     Document this training in accordance with AFI 34-219.
     3.14.3. Use the standard AF club POS System to perform a sales mix analysis twice per year
     for the club’s bar operations.
3.15. Catering Operations. The Air Force Catering Program is the foundation for all Air Force
club catering operations. Use of the Air Force Catering Program standard policies, procedures
and software is mandatory. The Air Force Catering Program operated by clubs is the primary
source for on-base catering.
3.16. Special Functions. The club manager:
     3.16.1. Documents each special function on a prenumbered special function contract that
     includes this statement: ―I understand that only authorized personnel may attend and that I
     am responsible for their conduct.‖
     3.16.2. Ensures the person who books the function agrees to pay the entire bill at the
     conclusion of the event or according to a previously determined payment agreement. This
     may include billing individual club cards using the pro-rata procedures. The club manager
     assists project officers in making the pro-rata process work effectively. See paragraph 2.11
     for project officer responsibilities.
     3.16.3. Consults the Club Operations Guide for instructions for a dining-in or dining-out.
     3.16.4. Does not advertise in civilian off-base media for private or club-sponsored functions.
     3.16.5. Accepts SF 44, Purchase Order-Invoice Voucher, from Air Force Recruiting
     Service personnel for meals and beverages.
     3.16.6. Accepts APFs for payment for official functions, (see AFI 65-106). The preferred
     method of payment is via a front-loaded Blanket Purchase Agreement, (procedures will be
     included in the revision of AFMAN 34-128 will convert to AFMAN 34-228). Payment via
     the International Merchant Purchasing Authorization Card (IMPAC) is also acceptable.
AFI34-272 1 APRIL 2002                                                                             19


   3.16.7. The preferred method for establishing and funding Official Functions that are to be
   supported with APF funds will be through the use of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).
   The MOA will be between the Installation Commander and the Services Squadron
   Commander. The Installation Protocol Office may act on behalf of the Installation
   Commander.
   3.16.8. The MOA will establish an agreed upon list of installation official functions the Club
   will support for one fiscal year. The MOA will include the approved price list. A function
   cancellation procedure will be included in the MOA, and the Installation Commander will
   make final determination concerning disputes.
   3.16.9. Club managers must prepare a price list for each room used for official functions
   when food and beverages will not be served (or food and beverage purchase is minimal).
   Only costs for setup (hourly salary, including benefits, multiplied by time), utilities (based on
   Para 3.16.11), and linens will be charged. This price list must be supported by
   documentation reflecting the method used to calculate the charges and it must be reviewed
   for currency by the NAFFA once a year.
   3.16.10. When charges are applied, club managers must ensure the APF room charges for
   utilities, setup and linens are entered as separate line items on each party sheet and only one
   billing is submitted for each service performed.
   3.16.11. Charges for utilities must be reasonable. Calculate utility charges by dividing the
   monthly utility charges by the number of hours the facility is open during the month,
   multiplying the resulting figure by the percentage of total square footage used for the
   function, and multiplying the resulting figure by the number of hours the function will last.
   For example, assume the function is to be conducted in a 1,000 square foot room in a club
   that has a total of 10,000 square feet of space, the club’s average monthly utility bill is
   $12,000, it is open an average of 320 hours a month, and the function will last 4 hours. You
   would compute the utility charge for the function as follows: $12,000/320 X 1,000/$10,000
   X 4 = $15.
   3.16.12. Clubs will not impose a charge for services that are already provided by
   appropriated funds without reimbursement; for example, for utility costs overseas or in
   remote and isolated areas.
3.17. Bingo Operations. Bingo may be conducted on bases (or portions thereof) in the United
States, its territories, and possessions that are fully ceded to the US Government. Bingo may
also be conducted on bases not fully ceded if it is legal in the host state, territory, or possession,
and on overseas Air Force bases unless it violates status-of-forces or other international
agreements.
   3.17.1. The Services commander or division chief may authorize:
       3.17.1.1. Cash prizes per session of play that increase up to a cumulative totals of
       $25,000 once each quarter for each club activity that regularly schedules bingo.
       3.17.1.2. Cash prizes limited to an amount less than the income from bingo card sales, to
       ensure the program doesn’t suffer a loss. Pay these prizes from the sales receipts of each
       session.
20                                                                     AFI34-272 1 APRIL 2002


        3.17.1.3. An actual cost, single merchandise prize (including US Savings Bonds) up to
        $10,000 in value. The club may offer a merchandise prize of up to $50,000 in value four
        times each year.
        3.17.1.4. A cumulative cash jackpot beginning at $10,000 or less. If it is not won,
        increase it in specific increments on successive sessions of play to a maximum of
        $50,000.
        3.17.1.5. Free bingo offered as a promotion. Charge these prizes to the promotional
        account.
     3.17.2. The MAJCOM/SV approves cash and merchandise prizes exceeding the limits
     established in paragraphs 3.17.1.1 through 3.17.1.4 above, and merchandise and cash prize
     limits for bingo programs conducted in foreign countries.
     3.17.3. Limit play in bingo programs to eligible patrons, their family members and guests.
     Club management personnel and employees involved in bingo operations (whether on or off
     duty) and their family members may not play bingo sponsored by the employing club.
     3.17.4. Complete Internal Revenue Service Form W-2G, Certain Gambling Winnings, for
     winners of $1,200 or more. The W-2G need not be completed where a foreign national wins
     $1,200 or more in bingo conducted in a foreign area, and the foreign national involved
     completes Internal Revenue Service Form W-8, Certificate of Foreign Status, which is
     retained at the installation involved.
3.18. Monte Carlo (Las Vegas) Events. The club manager:
     3.18.1. May offer Monte Carlo games in the United States and its territories and its
     possessions if state and local laws permit them. International agreements apply overseas.
     3.18.2. Limits play to members of the club and their adult family members, members of
     other clubs exercising reciprocal privileges and their adult family members, and adult guests.
     3.18.3. May not allow club personnel, or volunteers working the event, or their family
     members to play.
     3.18.4. Ensures Monte Carlo is a scheduled event and is only conducted occasionally.
     3.18.5. May not allow use of electronic or mechanical devices designed and manufactured
     primarily for gambling.
     3.18.6. May not allow the use of legal currency in the games.
     3.18.7. Ensures non-monetary prizes are awarded or purchased with some form of money
     substitute.
     3.18.8. May not allow players to use or exchange money substitutes for legal tender at any
     time.
3.19. Air Force Signature Brands. Signature Brand concepts are alternative in-house Air
Force club brands that standardize menus, product, and decor. Signature Brands operate based
upon a Signature Brand Operating Agreement (SBOA) between the base and the Air Force
Services Agency. The Signature Brand Management Panel (SBMP) is responsible for oversight,
and making recommendations on development and deployment of AF club Signature Brands.
AFI34-272 1 APRIL 2002                                                                         21


3.20. Name Brand Restaurant [Food, Beverage and Entertainment (FB&E)]
Operations. Headquarters Air Force Services Agency, Directorate, Clubs, Issues and Special
Programs (HQ AFSVA/SVO), through the Headquarters Air Force Service Agency, Director of
Nonappropriated Fund Purchasing Office (AFNAFPO), is the sole non-Army and Air Force
Exchange Service contracting authority for name brand operations on Air Force installations.
MAJCOMs and bases should neither contact nor contract with name brands. This includes any
signature, national, regional or manufactured brand, restaurant, fast food or other food, beverage
and entertainment concepts. Contracts existing as of 8 May 98 are ―grandfathered‖ until they
expire. Extension of these contracts is not authorized, unless approved in advance by the
AFNAFPO.
3.21. Vending and Amusement Machines (excluding slot machines). Either the club, the Air
Force Recreation Amusement Machine Program (AFRAMP), or the club’s concessionaire may
own and operate amusement and vending machines in club facilities.
   3.21.1. Vending machines are cash or cardoperated mechanical or electronic machines that
   provides a product or service on a selfsustaining basis. Don't sell tobacco products from
   customer operated vending machines. See AFI 34-206, Vending Facility Program for the
   Blind on Air Force Property (will convert to AFI 34-411), for requirements for sharing
   vending machine income.
   3.21.2. Amusement machines are cash or cardoperated mechanical or electronic machines.
   Such machines are provided for the use of authorized patrons. Clubs may not have
   amusement machines with a cash pay-out feature, except slot machines in authorized
   overseas locations.
3.22. Concessionaire Operated Activities. Club activities operated by concessionaires are
governed by AFMAN 34-212, AFMAN 34-214, AFI 34-202 (will convert to AFI 34-410), and
AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility.
3.23. Barber and Beauty Shops. Clubs may have barber and beauty shops or allow a
concessionaire to operate them subject to the provisions in AFMAN 34-128 (will convert to

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change rescinds the mandatory requirement to use computerized inventory management
software in clubs. It also corrects an error that directed the use of a nonexistent membership
application form for TDY personnel. A bar (|) indicates revisions from the previous edition.

Air Force club membership application to process memberships for TDY personnel. Transfer
these members to the club at their home base upon completion of the TDY.
3.13.5. If a club uses automated inventory management software, it must be the standard Air
Force automated system.
