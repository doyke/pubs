Part I

Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training
document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources and minimum
requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and instill
rigor in all aspects of career field training. This CFETP supersedes CFETP2T1X1, 1 March 2006 and
CFETP2T1X1C1, 17 May 2007.

NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification
training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts. Supervisors plan, manage and control training within the career field
using both parts of the plan.

   2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains
   how everyone will use the plan. Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and
   responsibilities, training strategies and career field path. Section C associates each level with specialty
   qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training and other). Section D indicates resource
   constraints; some examples include funds, manpower, equipment and facilities. Section E identifies
   transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.

   2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and
   includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command
   (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, core task and correspondence course requirements. Section
   B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen
   satisfied training requirements. Section C identifies available support materials; an example is a
   Qualification Training Package (QTP) developed to support proficiency training. These packages are
   identified in http://www.e-publishing.af.mil. Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can
   use to determine resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional
   courses. Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine
   additional training required for the associated qualification needs.

         2.2.1. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan and conduct training
         commensurate with the overall goals of this guide.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and
efficient training at the appropriate point in their careers. This plan will enable us to train today’s work force
for tomorrow’s jobs.

SECTION A - GENERAL INFORMATION

1. Purpose. This CFETP provides the information necessary for Air Force Career Field Managers
(AFCFM), MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training managers, supervisors and
trainers to plan, develop, manage and conduct an effective career field training program. This plan outlines
the training individuals in the AFS should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.
This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training. Initial skills
training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining
into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the
technical training centers. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements
and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7- and 9-skill level.
Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a
specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is
designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job. Advanced Training is
formal specialty training used for selected Airmen. Proficiency training is additional training, either in-
residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to increase
their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has several purposes;
some are:

   1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct and evaluate a career field training program.
   Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual’s career.

   1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and
   recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.

   1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training and training delivery
   methods.

   1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field
   training process.

2. Uses. The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive
training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.

NOTE: The Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) serves as the MFM for personnel assigned in Air
Force Elements (AFELM).

    2.1. AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, nonresident, field and exportable
training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP. They
will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide
the identified training.

    2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and
proficiency requirements. OJT, resident training, contract training or exportable courses can satisfy
identified requirements. MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFS must be identified for inclusion
into the plan.



                                                       7
   2.3. Unit Education and Training Managers and supervisors must ensure each individual completes the
mandatory training requirements (including MAJCOM supplemental requirements) for the upgrade training
specified in this plan.

    2.4. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The lists
of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.

3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority for the CFETP. Also, the AFCFM
will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. MAJCOM representatives
and AETC personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements. Using the list of
courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

entire spectrum of training requirements for the Vehicle Operations career field. The spectrum includes a
strategy for when, where and how to meet the training requirements. The strategy must be apparent and
affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training. The following
decisions were made as a result of close coordination between 364 TRS TDE, school house, field SMEs,
functional managers and the AFCFM. The final training requirements were approved by the AFCFM.

   6.1. Initial Skills Training. The Vehicle Operator Apprentice course was designed to provide

   9.2. Transportation Occupational Badge. The Transportation badge reflects a great history and
   tradition. By wearing it, you will be recognized by your fellow Airmen as having achieved an expected
   level of competence. The multitude of transporters before you established this expectation through
   excellent service in both peace and war. Eligibility criteria for award and wear of Air Force occupational
   badges can be found in AFI 36-2903, DRESS AND PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF AIR FORCE
   PERSONNEL.

       9.2.1. Transportation Badge Heraldry. The falcon at the center of the badge is derived from the
       Triforium Termination Stone Carving dedicated to the United States Air Force Logistics Personnel at
       the National Cathedral, Washington D.C. on 10 May 1970. The Falcon represents the dedication and
       devotion to duty of logistics personnel who aid the generation and employment of defense forces
       across the spectrum of warfare. The Field of the badge symbolizes the peace aerospace forces
       engender through professional transportation. In its talons, the falcon grasps a globe which represents
       earth as seen from space. Encircling the globe are three arrows running parallel to each other to
       symbolize the teamwork between all facets of transportation. The globe and arrows symbolize the
       Air Force Transportation vision statement: Building the world’s most effective movement systems to
       provide global reach for America. The globe represents the span of our systems around the world and
       into space. The three arrows indicate rapid, responsive movements by all modes of transportation,
       Land, Sea and Air.

       9.2.2. Basic Badge. The basic badge is awarded upon successful completion of the Vehicle Operator
       apprentice course.

       9.2.3. Senior Badge. The senior badge adds a star to the top of the badge. Wear the senior badge
       after award of the 7-skill level.

       9.2.4. Master Badge. The master badge adds a wreath around the star. The master badge is awarded
       to Master Sergeants or above with 5 years in the specialty from award of the 7-skill level.

PART II

SECTION A – COURSE OBJECTIVE LIST

1. Measurement. Measurement of each objective is indicated as follows: “W” indicates task or subject
knowledge which is measured using a written test. “PC” indicates required task performance which is
measured with a performance progress check. “PC/W” indicates separate measurement of both knowledge
and performance elements using a written test and a performance progress check.

2. Standard. The standard is 70% on written examinations. Standards for performance measurement are
indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist. Instructor assistance is
provided as needed during the progress check and students may be required to repeat all or part of the
behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.

3. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the
student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially
proficient). The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.

4. Course Objective List. A detailed listing of initial skills course objectives may be obtained by
contacting the school house Training Manager, at DSN 736-2772, Comm (940) 676-2772 or
364 TRS/TRR, 511 9th Ave STE 1, Sheppard AFB TX, 76311-2338.

SECTION D – MAJCOM UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS

10. There are currently no MAJCOM unique requirements. This area is reserved

SECTION E - SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD

11. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes beginning
13 December 2012 and graduating 7 February 2013.

12. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:

   12.1. Lists in Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical References) the most common tasks,
   knowledge and Technical References (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5- and 7-
   skill level.

   12.2. Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies core tasks (specialty-wide training requirements) by an asterisk
   (*) in the 5-skill level column or in the 7-skill level column. As a minimum, trainees must complete
   hands-on certification on appropriate 5 or 7-skill level core and critical tasks for skill-level upgrade.

       12.2.1. All tasks in the 3-level course column are considered wartime tasks. In response to a wartime
       scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3-level course in a streamlined training environment.

   12.3. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of task and knowledge
   training requirements. Use automated training management systems to document technician
   qualifications, if available. Task certification must show a training completion date and initials of the
   trainee, trainer and certifier. All non-core tasks require training completion date and initials of the trainee
   and trainer only.

   12.4. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the
   proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task and
   knowledge provided by the initial skills and craftsman courses and the career knowledge provided by the
   correspondence course. See the unit education and training manager for current CDC listings.

   12.5. Qualitative Requirements. Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the
   level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.

   12.6. Tasks are identified on the Job Qualification Standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in
   AF Form 623, Individual Training Record and used according to AFI 36-2201. For OJT, the tasks in
   Column 1 are trained and qualified to the “go” or “no go” level. “Go” means the individual can perform
   the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness and correct use of
   procedures. When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:

       12.6.1. Documentation. Document and certify completion of training.



                                                       24
          12.6.1.1. Transcribing. Transcribing documentation to a new CFETP is an administrative
          function, not a re-evaluation of training. Therefore, supervisor and trainer are considered
          synonymous for the purpose of documentation. Transcribe within 120 days (240 days for ARC)
          of published date of revised CFETP. Upon publication of a new CFETP, use the following
          procedures to transcribe:

          12.6.1.2. Use the new CFETP to identify past and current training requirements and to transcribe
          qualifications from the previous CFETP.

          12.6.1.3. For tasks previously certified and required in the current duty position, circle the
          subparagraph number next to the task statement and enter the current date in the completion
          column. Trainee initials in the trainee column and the current task certifier or supervisor/trainer
          initials in the trainer column.

          12.6.1.4. For tasks previously certified but not required in the current duty position (do not
          circle), transcribe only the previous certification date (no initials). If the task later becomes
          required in the duty position, recertify using current dates and initials.

          12.6.1.5. Annotate the AF Form 623a, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, (for
          example; “I certify the information contained in the CFETP dated XX was transcribed to the
          CFETP dated XX, and the trainee was given the superseded CFETP.” Signed and dated by
          supervisor and trainee).

          12.6.1.6. Identify current duty position requirements by circling the subparagraph number or
          letter next to the task statement. Additionally, all core tasks (*) should be circled. Document task
          completion by annotating columns 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D and 3E as appropriate.

NOTE: All entries shall be made in pencil.

          12.6.1.7. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available, the supervisor
          identifies STS training references the trainee requires for career knowledge IAW AFI 36-2201
          and ensures, as a minimum, trainees cover all mandatory items specified in AFMAN 36-2108,
          Enlisted Classification. For two-time CDC exam failures, the unit commander will take
          appropriate action IAW AFI 36-2201. NOTE: Career knowledge must be documented prior to
          submitting a CDC waiver.

          12.6.1.8. Decertification and Recertification. When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a
          task, the supervisor shall erase previous certification and enter Airman into qualification training.
          Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form 623a, On-The-Job Training Record
          Continuation Sheet, as to the reason for decertification. The individual is recertified using the
          normal certification process.

   12.7. The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion
   System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the USAF Occupational
   Measurement Squadron by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields. The



                                                      25
   tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most
   appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the
   WAPS catalog. Individual responsibilities are in chapter 14 of AFI 36-2606, United States Air Force
   Reenlistment, Retention, and NCO Status Programs. WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard
   or Air Reserve Forces.

13. Recommendations. Comments and recommendations are invited concerning the quality of training
AETC graduates receive. Reference specific STS paragraphs and address correspondence regarding changes
to 782 TRG/TGAV, 620 9th Avenue, Suite 3, Sheppard AFB TX 76311-2268. A customer service
information line has been installed for the supervisor’s convenience to identify graduates who may have
received over or under training on task/knowledge items listed in this training standard. For a quick response
to problems, call our customer service information line at DSN: 736-2574 or email csil@sheppard.af.mil
anytime day or night.

Explanation
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a
specific task. (Example: b and 1b)

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific
task, or for a subject common to several tasks.

- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.

X This mark is used alone in the course columns to show training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.

 NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during war time.
