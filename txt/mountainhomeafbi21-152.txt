This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Managing Aerospace Equipment Maintenance. It prescribes
policies and procedures for monitoring jet engine internal performance. This program applies to all main-
tenance units, and applicable Air National Guard (ANG) units. Ensure that all records created as a result
of processes prescribed in AFMAN 37-123 (to be replaced by AFMAN 33-363) are maintained in accor-
dance with this manual, and are disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Sched-
ule (RDS) located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil. Contact supporting records managers as required.


1. Purpose. The Engine Trending & Diagnostic (ET&D) program is intended to further the safe opera-
tion, performance reliability, and lower maintenance operating costs of installed gas turbine engines. The
program analyzes trends in all available engine parameters to detect the onset of engine internal failures
and shifts in instrumentation calibration or accuracy. When properly administered, this will be an effec-
tive management tool that allows maintenance personnel to take corrective actions before an engine fail-
ure or expensive secondary damage occurs.

2. Capabilities. The 366th Fighter Wing (366 FW) ET&D program enhances management of the Moun-
tain Home AFB (MHAFB) propulsion systems by providing up-to-date program status and engine fleet
health information to the Maintenance Group Commander.

       4.1.1. Appoint a Senior NCO Propulsion system supervisor as ET&D Project NCO.
       4.1.2. Appoint primary and alternate ET&D Monitors for each assigned MDS. The positions
       should be considered an additional duty for appointed individuals. 366 MXG/CC may assign per-
       sonnel that do not meet the AFSC requirement, but possess the expertise and knowledge of the
       engine as ET&D monitors.
       4.1.3. Ensure the primary and alternate ET&D Project NCOs receives the ET&D training course
       within 6 months of assignment of duty or at the earliest opportunity.
       4.1.4. Ensure ET&D computers obtained from OC-ALC are not modified or used for non-ET&D
       applications to include and not limited to Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS), E-mail,
       Internet and Intranet.
    4.2. ET&D Project NCO will:
       4.2.1. Manage and coordinate the ET&D program for 366 MXG/CC.
       4.2.2. Administer the ET&D program in accordance with ACCI 21-152, applicable technical
       orders (TO), and this instruction. Validate ET&D monitor recommendation for maintenance
       actions as a result of engine trending or analysis.
       4.2.3. Review engine data and advise the 366th Maintenance Group (366 MXG) Commander on
       issues requiring attention.
       4.2.4. Conduct quarterly review of engine performance using computer data. As a minimum, 366
       MXG ET&D Project NCO (Chairperson), ET&D Monitors, and Air Force Engineering Technical
       Services (AFETS) will form a panel to review program status/results on a quarterly basis.
       4.2.5. Act as the wing POC for all recommended changes to this instruction.
       4.2.6. Maintain a register of where the ET&D equipment is located.
    4.3. The 366th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (366 AMXS) will:
       4.3.1. Ensure Aircraft Maintenance Units (AMU) comply with wing ET&D program.
    4.4. AMU ET&D Monitor will:
       4.4.1. Be a qualified Propulsion technician AFSC (minimum 2A651A or civilian equivalent).
       These individuals must be knowledgeable of engine operation and troubleshooting and repair pro-
       cedures.
       4.4.2. Ensure engine flight data is downloaded following the daily flying period, entered into the
       Comprehensive Engine Trending and Diagnostic System (CETADS) database and forwarded to
       the Engine Management Element (EME) no later than 0700 the next duty day.
       4.4.3. Ensure 366 AMXS deployed engine monitors make an appointment with MHAFB EME 1
       week prior to deployment for a pre-departure brief. In addition, they will bring their CETADS
       laptop to this appointment to ensure CETADS is functioning properly and updated with the latest
       version of CETADS and all other requirements in EME pre-deployment letter.
       4.4.4. When the engine Intelligence Trending and Diagnostic System (ITADS) fault indicates
       maintenance or engine removal is required, the ET&D monitor must coordinate with the project
       NCO and appropriate agencies.
