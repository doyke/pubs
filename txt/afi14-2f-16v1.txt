        1.2.3.3. Address time sensitive changes by immediate action message.
1.3. Qualification Training. Qualification training programs are designed to progress
intelligence personnel from Initial Qualification Training (IQT) to Mission Qualification
Training (MQT) to achieve Combat Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC)
status which will be maintained via continuation training and validated by periodic intelligence
evaluations.
     1.3.1. IQT provides the initial training necessary to qualify intelligence personnel for basic
     duties in an intelligence position without regard to a unit’s mission. Upon completion of IQT,
     intelligence personnel attain Basic Qualification (BQ) status. BQ is a prerequisite for MQT.
     BQ is not a long-term qualification status. IQT is discussed further in Chapter 2 of this
     instruction.
     1.3.2. MQT provides the training necessary to qualify or requalify intelligence personnel in a
     specific duty position to perform the missions assigned to a specific unit. Intelligence
     personnel maintain BQ status until they complete MQT. Completion of MQT is a
     prerequisite for both CMR and BMC status. (T-2) MQT is discussed further in Chapter 3 of
     this instruction.
     1.3.3. Continuation Training (CT) provides the volume, frequency and mix of training
     necessary for intelligence personnel to maintain proficiency in their assigned qualification
     level. The Ready Intelligence Program (RIP) outlines the minimum CT requirements. RIP is
     designed to focus training on capabilities needed to accomplish a unit’s core tasked missions.
AFI14-2F-16V1 2 JUNE 2008                                                                       7


   CT is separate from skill level upgrade training, although CT may fulfill some skill level
   upgrade training requirements. CT and RIP are discussed further in Chapter 4 of this
   instruction.
   1.3.4. Specialized Training is training in any skill necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned
   missions that is not required for every intelligence unit member. Specialized Training is
   normally accomplished after Mission Qualification Training and after the member has
   attained CMR or BMC status, and is in addition to CMR or BMC requirements. Specialized
   Training is discussed further in Chapter 5 of this instruction.
1.4. Position Qualification. Wing SIOs will designate which positions are CMR or BMC. As a
minimum, all flying squadron intelligence personnel will be CMR. (T-2)
   1.4.1. Combat Mission Ready (CMR). The status of intelligence personnel who have
   satisfactorily completed MQT and maintain qualification and currency in the mission
   qualification tasks and knowledge outlined in this instruction.
      1.4.1.1. CMR intelligence personnel maintain proficiency, currency and qualification in
      all core mission skills of the unit to which they are assigned or attached. In order to
      maintain CMR status, intelligence personnel must maintain currencies by accomplishing
      all designated tasks within the prescribed timelines. See Chapter 4, Table 4.1, for RIP
      currency requirements and Chapter 5, Table 5.1, for Specialized Training currency
      requirements. Failure to complete this training or maintain these currencies will result in
      regression to non-CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived by the SIO. While N-CMR,
      personnel may perform only individual tasks in which they are current and qualified. (T-
      2)
      1.4.1.2. Personnel should meet CMR currency requirements before deploying. However,
      in the case of short-notice deployments where this is not possible, the SIO can allow
      BMC personnel to deploy. If the SIO is forced to deploy an individual who hasn't met
      CMR currency requirements, the SIO will ensure the member's deployed chain-of-
      command is aware of the member's currency status. (T-2)
   1.4.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). The status of intelligence personnel who have
   satisfactorily completed MQT, are qualified in the unit mission, but do not maintain CMR
   status. Personnel must be able to attain CMR currency within 30 days. BMC designations
   are normally assigned to intelligence personnel who primarily perform wing supervision or
   staff functions that directly support intelligence operations. (T-3)
      1.4.2.1. BMC personnel must maintain currencies by accomplishing all designated tasks
      within the prescribed timelines. See Chapter 4, Table 4.1., for RIP currency requirements
      and Chapter 5, Table 5.1., for Specialized Training currency requirements. Failure to
      complete BMC required training results in regression to non-BMC (N-BMC) status.
      While N-BMC, personnel may perform only individual tasks in which they are current
      and qualified. (T-2)
   1.4.3. Intelligence personnel who regress to N-CMR or N-BMC status will accomplish the
   requirements IAW Chapter 4 before being re-awarded CMR or BMC status. (T-2)
1.5. Documentation. Training will be documented in coordination with AF/A2 approved
processes regarding online documentation. (T-2)

                                              Chapter 2

                            INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines initial qualification training (IQT) of F-16 unit intelligence
personnel. IQT for intelligence personnel begins after initial skills training is completed (i.e. the
AFSC-awarding courses) and will consist of the F-16 Intelligence Formal Training Unit (IFTU)
(or Transition IFTU, as applicable). At the completion of IQT, the individual is certified as BQ.
In exceptional circumstances, when IFTU training is not available within a reasonable time
period, the IFTU portion of IQT may be conducted at the local unit IAW this chapter. When

                           MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. Mission qualification training (MQT) is training necessary to qualify intelligence
personnel in an assigned position to perform the unit mission. Guidance in this chapter is
provided to assist SIOs in executing the MAJCOM/A2 approved minimum MQT requirements
for all individuals newly assigned the BQ qualification. Units may further tailor their programs
for intelligence personnel with current qualifications, prior experience, currency, documented
performance or formal training. Applicable portions of MQT may be used to create a
requalification program for personnel who have regressed from CMR or BMC to specifically
address deficiencies which caused regression. (T-3)
    3.1.1. Intelligence personnel must have completed IQT before MQT can be completed. (T-
    3)
    3.1.2. MQT will be completed within the time specified by each MAJCOM below. Timing
    starts within 45 days (90 days for Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and ANG) of the
    individual’s first duty day at the gaining unit. If personnel elect to take leave prior to being
    entered into MQT, the timing will begin after the termination of the leave. For first term
    airmen being entered into MQT, the timing will begin upon completion of the First Term
    Airman Course (or equivalent) at their gaining unit. Training is complete upon successful
    completion of MQT tasks, a successful INIT MSN in accordance with AFI 14-2F-16 Volume
    2, AFI 14-202 Volume 2, and SIO endorsement. (T-2)
        3.1.2.1. For AFRC, notify the HQ AFRC/A2 (or equivalent) and NAF/A2 (or equivalent)
        if training exceeds 120 days with seasoning or 180 calendar days without seasoning. For
        individual mobilization augmentees (IMAs), notify MAJCOM IMA Program Manager
        and AFRC/A2. (T-2)
        3.1.2.2. For ANG, notify the NGB/A2 if training exceeds 180 calendar days. (T-2)
        3.1.2.3. For ACC, AETC, PACAF, and USAFE, notify MAJCOM/A2 if training exceeds
        120 calendar days. (T-2)
    3.1.3. Personnel in MQT may participate in exercises if supervised while performing
    intelligence functions. The level of supervision is at the SIO’s discretion. (T-3)
    3.1.4. Assigned IMAs will be trained and equipped to established command standards for
    the positions they will assume. IMAs have the same training timelines as AFRC/ANG
    members (ARC). (T-2)

                                CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General. This chapter outlines intelligence continuation training (CT) requirements for
CMR and BMC intelligence personnel. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of
internal intelligence training in basic intelligence task and knowledge items. These training
topics ensure familiarization with local unit intelligence functions, F-16 capabilities and threat
system capabilities. The second aspect of CT consists of specific mission-related training
required to accomplish the unit’s assigned missions. The Ready Intelligence Program (RIP) is
designed to focus training on capabilities needed to accomplish the unit’s tasked missions. CMR
and BMC intelligence personnel must complete appropriate RIP tasks and successfully
accomplish periodic mission qualification evaluations (MSNs) in accordance with AFI 14-202
Volume 2 and AFI 14-2F-16 Volume 2 to maintain currency and qualification. (T-2)
4.2. Internal Intelligence Training Program. The internal training program is intended to
facilitate maintaining designated qualification and currency status for all intelligence personnel.
While the SIO is ultimately accountable for the successful completion of all required training,
individual training is the responsibility of the trainee and supervisor. This guidance is intended
to provide a basic starting point and may be modified by the SIO based on unit requirements.
Training for these events will consist of unit-developed academics and scenarios. (T-3)
   4.2.1. The SIO will appoint an intelligence training program manager to oversee program
   execution. (T-3)
   4.2.2. Internal intelligence training that is not part of qualification training may be
   conducted, led or trained by personnel who are not designated intelligence qualification
   trainers. (T-3)
   4.2.3. The Intelligence Personnel Training Program Manager will develop an internal
   intelligence training plan that will include all training items for each intelligence duty
   position in the unit. (T-3)
   4.2.4. Internal intelligence training examinations will be compiled from the lead MAJCOM
   developed MQF, as a minimum. The Intelligence Personnel Training Program Manager
   should augment the MQF with specific questions relevant to the unit’s mission. (T-3)
   4.2.5. Internal Intelligence Training Program Requirements. The Internal Intelligence
   Training Program should continue to emphasize MQT tasks (which are identified in Chapter
   3 of this instruction) to facilitate RIP requirements. Therefore, the internal training program
   will cover at a minimum: (T-2)
       4.2.5.1. F-16 Capabilities – to include avionics, munitions, tactics, mission types and
       capabilities and limitations.
       4.2.5.2. Threat Knowledge – to include potential adversary aircraft, SAMs, AAA, naval
       and ground threat system capabilities and limitations with respect to F-16 operations.
       4.2.5.3. Visual Recognition – to include identification features of friendly and enemy
       threat systems.
AFI14-2F-16V1 2 JUNE 2008                                                                      15


       4.2.5.4. Intelligence Systems – to include OB maintenance, mission planning, imagery
       retrieval, and reporting software applications.
       4.2.5.5. Order of Battle – to include manual plotting, automated OB update procedures,
       unit checklists/standards for OB maintenance.
       4.2.5.6. Briefing – to include preparing and conducting current intelligence, deployment,
       initial situation, situation, mission and step briefings.
       4.2.5.7. Mission Planning – to include ATO/ACO/SPINS breakout, mission planning
       software applications, mission package construction, basic targeting and weaponeering
       solutions.
       4.2.5.8. Debriefing – to include theater specific requirements, techniques and applicable
       follow on questions.
       4.2.5.9. Reporting – to include theater intelligence reporting directives, software
       applications and transmitting.
       4.2.5.10. PR – to include theater specific techniques, academics, ISOPREP requirements,
       and EPA requirements.
       4.2.5.11. Force Protection Intelligence – to include intelligence support to FP principles;
       irregular/guerrilla/terrorist forces and organizations; force protection conditions and
       terrorist threat levels; and unit force protection considerations.
4.3. Ready Intelligence Program (RIP). The intent of the Ready Intelligence Program is to
ensure intelligence personnel perform specific mission essential tasks with sufficient frequency
to maintain proficiency in their duty positions. In order to maximize training opportunities and
minimize artificiality, RIP tasks should be conducted in conjunction with day-to-day flying
training missions (e.g. Red Flag missions, local live fly exercises, etc.) as much as possible.
Individuals are responsible for documenting RIP task completion. The standard task
requirements listed in Table 4.1, F-16 Ready Intelligence Program Requirements, establish the
minimum frequency requirement for CMR and BMC personnel. All intelligence personnel
filling duty positions that are designated as CMR or BMC will accomplish the requirements as
shown in Table 4.1. Failure to accomplish these requirements will affect the individual’s CMR
or BMC currency and additional training will be required as determined by the SIO. (T-2)
4.4. Intelligence Training Report. A written evaluation of the wing/group intelligence training
program will be submitted to the SIO at the end of each training cycle. At a minimum, the SIO
will forward the training report to the OG/CC and OSS/CC. (T-3)

4.5. Currency. Table 4.1 defines frequency requirements for all intelligence personnel required
to maintain current CMR or BMC status. If an intelligence specialist loses currency in a
particular area, the individual may not perform that task unsupervised until currency is regained.
Intelligence personnel must demonstrate proficiency in all delinquent RIP items with an SIO-
designated supervisor to regain currency. For example, if an individual accomplished a quarterly
RIP item (e.g., Debriefing) on 15 Oct 07, he/she must accomplish that task again by 15 Jan 08 to
remain current. If the task is not completed in the specified timeframe, the individual becomes
non-current and must demonstrate proficiency of the task with an SIO-designated supervisor
prior to conducting the task unsupervised. (T-2)
4.6. Requalification. Intelligence personnel are unqualified upon expiration of their
qualification evaluation. This includes specialized qualifications. For all intelligence personnel,
requalification requirements are as follows: (T-2)
   4.6.1. Unqualified up to 2 Years. Complete training in all delinquent items, additional
   training as directed by the SIO and be task evaluated via a mission evaluation.
   4.6.2. Unqualified over 2 Years. Re-accomplish MQT and the INIT MSN.
4.7. Regression. If an intelligence specialist does not meet currency requirements throughout
the training cycle, the SIO may direct the specialist be regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC (as
applicable). Regression and the steps taken to correct the situation will be documented in a
memorandum for record in the individual's qualification training and evaluation record.
CMR/BMC intelligence specialists regressed to N-CMR/ N-BMC for failing to remain current
must complete an SIO-approved recertification program to return them to CMR/BMC standards.
The tasks accomplished during the re-certification program may be credited toward task
requirements for the training cycle. (T-2)

   5.2.4. External Intelligence Trainer Evaluation. This evaluation will be conducted IAW AFI
   14-202 Volume 2 and AFI 14-2F-16 Volume 2. Personnel are qualified as EITs upon
   successful evaluation of required tasks, an initial external intelligence training instructor
   evaluation (INIT EIT) and endorsement from the SIO. Only IEs may conduct INIT EIT and
   EIT evaluations. Personnel not assigned or attached to a flying squadron may be qualified to
   instruct in individual training (threat, C&R, VR, and/or PR), as determined by the SIO. All
   external intelligence trainers must be qualified prior to conducting unsupervised training. In
   certain circumstances it may be beneficial to qualify an individual to conduct training in one
   or more events, but not require a full EIT qualification. The individual must complete the
   specific training identified for the event and be evaluated on the task/briefing element by an
   IE. Document the evaluation IAW local procedures. The individual must maintain currency
   for the subject matter according to Table 5.1 and must be reevaluated IAW the AFI 14-202
   Volume 2 and AFI 14-2F-16 Volume 2. (T-2)
   5.2.5. External Intelligence Trainer Currency. Table 5.1, External Intelligence Trainer
   Event Currencies, defines currency requirements for all intelligence personnel required to
   maintain current EIT status. EITs must also successfully complete periodic External
   Intelligence Trainer evaluations (EITs) in accordance with AFI 14-2F-16 Volume 2. If an
   external intelligence trainer loses currency in a particular area, the individual may not
   perform training unsupervised until currency is regained. To regain currency EITs must
   satisfy overdue training requirements while supervised by another EIT current and qualified
   in the same training requirement. (T-2)
