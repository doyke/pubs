                                             Chapter 1

                                STUDENT ADMINISTRATION

1.1. Casual Student Officer Management:
     1.1.1. General. Casual student officers are those who have reported to their assigned UCT
     base and are awaiting training. AFPC/DPSIP uses a computer program to efficiently schedule
     casual student officers for the initial flight screening (IFS) (if needed), water survival, and
     UCT and to minimize their “casual” time prior to entering the training pipeline.
     1.1.2. Roles and Responsibilities:
        1.1.2.1. The operations support squadron student management flight (OSS/OSH)
        manages all casual student officers.
        1.1.2.2. The unit will not change any IFS, water survival, or UCT training dates. The unit
        will develop a list of “hot spares,” primarily Officer Training School graduates, who have
        completed IFS and water survival. The purpose of the “hot spares” is to fill any UCT
        training slot that may go unfilled as a result of higher than anticipated IFS attrition. If a
        student requires adjustment to the assigned training dates, OSS/OSH will contact
        AFPC/DPSIP at DSN 665-2102 for resolution.
        1.1.2.3. The 479 OSS/OSH will:
            1.1.2.3.1. Categorize casual student officers based on the time between their report
            date and their UCT class start date. Short-term (90 calendar days or less) casual
            student officers stay in the flying training group to ensure completion of all in-
            processing, temporary duties (TDY), and permanent change of station (PCS)
            requirements, and only fill short-term or one-time manpower requirements.
            1.1.2.3.2. Attempt to detail long-term (more than 90 calendar days) casual student
            officers within the flying training group. If a place in the group is not available, these
            officers may be assigned throughout the base.
            1.1.2.3.3. Relieve casual student officers from all details 10 calendar days prior to
            their UCT class start date.
            1.1.2.3.4. Place UCT eliminees on casual status until they depart the base for a PCS.
     1.1.3. Accountability. Casual student officers are valuable Air Force members, and the
     OSS must maintain accountability. The 479 OSS commander (CC) maintains administrative
     control (ADCON) over all casual student officers, regardless of the unit they support. The
     479 OSS/CC ensures casual student officers are ready to start scheduled training, provides
     continuing professional development, and motivates students for their flying careers.
     ADCON includes, but is not limited to, the following actions:
        1.1.3.1. Disciplinary Action. The OSS/CC is the first level authority for all Uniform
        Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) actions.
            1.1.3.1.1. The OSS/CC monitors each casual student officer’s performance from the
            date of arrival until departing the base for the student’s follow-on assignment.
AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                               7


        1.1.3.1.2. If prior to entry into UCT, a casual student officer's performance or
        conduct becomes questionable and the OSS/CC believes the student should be
        removed from the CSO training selection list for cause, the OSS/CC will notify
        AETC/A3FC.
        1.1.3.1.3. The Wing Commander (WG/CC) will determine if a casual student officer
        should be removed from the CSO training selection list for cause based on the
        respective subordinate commander’s recommendation and the totality of the
        circumstances. When the misconduct is serious enough to warrant discharge from
        service under AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures for Commissioned
        Officers, the responsible AETC show cause authority initiates discharge action. Refer
        to AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers, for additional administrative
        procedures. Provide information to AFPC/DPSIP as required by AFI 36-2110,
        Assignments, paragraph 2.41.2, for officers eliminated from flying training. In
        addition, notify AETC/A3RA and AETC/A3FC.
     1.1.3.2. Recalls. Casual student officers will report to the OSS/OSH according to the
     recall option for accountability and sign-in prior to reporting to their duty assignment.
     1.1.3.3. Duty Hours. Casual student officer duty supervisors are responsible for
     maintaining accountability of the casual student officers during all duty periods.
     1.1.3.4. Mentoring. All casual student officers will be present for mentoring sessions
     set by the 479 OSS/OSH as required. Students will be released back to their duty
     assignments upon completion.
     1.1.3.5. Mishap Reporting. Casual student officer duty supervisors will notify the
     OSS/OSH of any on- or off-duty mishap. If the duty supervisor completes an
     AETC Form 435, Mishap Data Worksheet, it will be routed it through OSS/OSH and the
     OSS/CC.
     1.1.3.6. Squadron Commander Calls/Safety Meetings. Release casual student officers
     to attend all 479 OSS/CC calls and safety meetings unless their duty is mission critical
     and their absence is coordinated with the OSS/OSH.
     1.1.3.7. Letter of Evaluation (LOE). Duty supervisors of casual student officers are
     highly encouraged to complete an optional LOE, which is the appropriate tool to capture
     a casual student officer’s performance. While the optional LOE is not filed in the
     selection record, it provides performance information to the subsequent rater for
     consideration when accomplishing the follow-on report (training or evaluation report).
     Officers may include their LOE in a letter to the board (for example, central selection
     board, force-shaping board, etc.), if convened prior to their next evaluation. In addition to
     LOEs, excellent performance can be documented with a decoration that becomes a part of
     the selection record. By completing optional LOEs, a level playing field is maintained
     among all students, regardless of casual status duties. LOEs and decorations will be
     routed through OSS/OSH and OSS/CCE for 479 OSS/CC recommendation and approval.
     1.1.3.8. Leave. Casual student officers will coordinate leave and pass requests through
     their duty supervisor prior to submitting them to the OSS/OSH for approval.
 8                                                  AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013


        1.1.3.9. Physical Training (PT). Casual student officers will participate in the
        OSS/OSH fitness program.
        1.1.3.10. Supervisors. The OSS/OSH pre- and post-training branches supervise casual
        student officers until they begin the primary phase of UCT. The assigned class
        commander assumes supervisory responsibility for the students during all phases of UCT.
        The OSS/OSH pre and post branch will supervise UCT eliminees until they PCS from the
        base. During each transfer of supervisory responsibilities, the losing supervisor will brief
        the gaining supervisor on each student’s progress, potential, and any problems which may
        affect the student’s training.
1.2. Course Entry Administration. Units will review incoming student records to verify they
are complete. Students must meet course entry prerequisites established in the syllabus. If a
student does not meet the course entry prerequisites, contact AETC/A3FC before entering the
student into training. As a minimum, units will review the following student records (or their
equivalents) prior to any formal training:
     1.2.1. Standardization/Evaluation (Stan/Eval) Records. These records are maintained in
     the flight evaluation folder (FEF). Depending on aircrew specialty, some individuals may not
     yet possess an FEF. Students hand-carry FEFs to training according to the Education and
     Training Course Announcements (ETCA) course requirements. If required, flying training
     units will forward applicable AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, and other
     Stan/Eval records and documents to the student’s home or gaining unit upon completion of
     training.
     1.2.2. Individual Flight Records. Students will hand-carry individual flight records to
     training according to the ETCA course requirements.
     1.2.3. Training Folders or Records from Previous Courses. (Pipeline students only)
     Pipeline students are those students who have not yet transferred PCS to an operational unit
     as permanent party members. If training records are not available, contact AETC/A3FC.
     1.2.4. Training Summaries (AETC Form 1121, Summary Performance Report UCT) and
     Student Biographies. The squadron commander (SQ/CC), squadron operations officer
     (SQ/DO), flight commander (FLT/CC), or designated representative will review all training
     summaries and student biographies included in the student training record.
1.3. Quota Management. The programmed flying training (PFT) document establishes the baseline
for student quota management, which reflects real-time changes and are the AETC aircrew training
primary source documents for class entry dates, student load, and production schedule information.
AETC/A3RA maintains the quota management worksheets. These worksheets are available at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-OP-AE-57. AETC provides class
quotas annually via electronic PFT pages. AETC/A3RA notifies affected units when quotas change.
     1.3.1. Units should obtain class entry rosters in the Personnel Data System not later than two
     weeks before class entry. Obtain rosters as early as possible to allow identification of excess
     capacity. Contact AETC/A3RA and AFPC/DPSIP to fill empty quotas if identified with
     adequate lead time.
     1.3.2. Units will report roster discrepancies as soon as they are discovered but no later than 3
     duty days following the class start date. Report changes and discrepancies to AETC/A3RA,
AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                9


   AFPC/DPSIP, and AETC/A3FC. In addition, report changes impacting aircraft assignment to
   AFPC/DPALT and AETC/A1KOD.
   1.3.3. Units will update the student’s records in the Personnel Data System upon changes in
   the projected graduation date, elimination from training, or graduation.
1.4. Production Metrics Report. AETC/A3RB is the point of contact (POC) for flying training
production metrics. At the beginning of each fiscal year, AETC/A3RB uploads the PFT
document to the flying training production analysis (FTPA) Web-based input tool
(https://adss.randolph.af.mil/FTPAW-CAC). The group commander or designated POC will
update the FTPA with actual entries, gains, losses, attritions, graduate numbers and notes, if
applicable. These updates are due 5 duty days after the class start date and class graduation date.
1.5. Special Reporting Procedures for ANG and AFRC Students. SQ/CCs ensure the
following actions are taken: (Note: This reporting is exempt from report control symbol (RCS)
reporting according to AFI 33-324, The Information Collections and Reports Management
Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections.)
   1.5.1. For ANG or AFRC Students Experiencing Difficulty: Units will notify AETC/A3G
   (for ANG) or AETC/A3H (for AFRC), as appropriate, via electronic mail (E-mail) when an
   ANG or AFRC student requires a progress check (PC) or an elimination check (EC), enters
   the commander’s review (CR) process, is placed on administrative hold, or is eliminated
   from or reinstated in training. In addition, notify AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H, as appropriate,
   when a student washes back a class or there is reasonable doubt about a student’s potential to
   complete a training syllabus. Include the student’s home unit and NGB/A3OC or
   AFRC/A3TB, as applicable, as addressees on the E-mails.
   1.5.2. Graduation Notification. If the student’s graduation date changes, units will notify
   the student’s home unit and NGB/A3OC or AFRC/A3TB of the student’s new graduation
   date by E-mail no later than 30 calendar days before the new date. When it appears that a
   student may graduate late, notify the student’s home unit as soon as possible. Send an
   information copy to AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H, as appropriate.
1.6. Physical Training (PT) Program. Students participate in a scheduled PT program
according to the appropriate syllabus; AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program, AETCI 11-406, Fighter
Aircrew Conditioning Program, and AFPAM 11-419, G-Awareness for Aircrew. UCT courses
require a passing score on the fitness test to graduate.
   1.6.1. U.S. Air Force UCT students will take the Air Force Fitness Assessment (FA)
   according to AFI 36-2905 prior to their first flight (preflight phase). Students who tested in
   all four components and scored an “excellent” (90 or above) on their latest FA are not
   required to test during the preflight phase unless their one year FA currency will expire
   during T-6A training. Enter students who fail the FA into a conditioning program according
   to AFI 36-2905 and retest. Multiple retestings are authorized, if required, during the preflight
   phase. If students have not passed the FA by the completion of the preflight phase, the
   SQ/CC will:
       1.6.1.1. Remove them from training and place them on administrative hold status until
       passing the FA.
       1.6.1.2. Notify AETC/A3FC (reference paragraph 1.8.2).
 10                                                AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013


       1.6.1.3. Enter them into the CR process and notify AETC/A3FC if after 90 calendar days
       the student still has not met the FA.
   1.6.2. All U.S. Air Force UCT students will take the Air Force FA test according to AFI 36-
   2905 during the advanced phase. Students who fail the FA will be entered into a conditioning
   program (see AFI 36-2905) and be retested. Students will not graduate nor be awarded an
   aviation rating without a current Excellent/Satisfactory score. In addition to the requirements
   in AFI 36-2905, continue students with an Exempt or Unsatisfactory FA score in training (if
   able), but place them on administrative hold prior to class graduation. These students will
   either pass the FA and graduate, or be eliminated from training through a CR. The unit will
   notify AETC/A3FC if a student does not pass the FA by the scheduled class graduation date
   (reference paragraph 1.8.2)
   1.6.3. Group (flight, class, etc.) physical training is highly encouraged to build esprit de
   corps, but it is not required. Units will document physical training accomplishments and
   ensure compliance by each student.
   1.6.4. All students must have a current FA with a passing score to attend survival, evasion,
   resistance, and escape (SERE) training after graduation from UCT.
   1.6.5. Students enrolled in graduate flying training courses must maintain fitness standards
   according to AFI 36-2905. They are encouraged to participate in host unit programs or
   complete three sessions of physical training per week.
1.7. Weight-for-Flight Standards. AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards,
establishes weight-for-flight standards for flying in ejection-seat aircraft. Students in training
who are outside the weight-for-flight range are given until they reach the flight line to get their
weight into the proper range. Enter undergraduate students who do not meet the weight for flight
standards in the CR process and notify AETC/A3FC (reference paragraph 1.8.2). Comply with
AFI 48-123 for graduate students.
1.8. Administrative Hold. Units place students on administrative hold whose training has been
suspended for other than medical reasons for more than 7 calendar days. Units should use
administrative hold judiciously for extenuating circumstances, to include family serious illness or
death, or other personal problems beyond the individual’s control. Units will notify the host
aviation resource management (HARM) office and the registrar of all administrative hold
actions. The registrar will update the student’s status in the Personnel Data System (if required)
to reflect the student status codes. Refer to AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1, Formal Aircrew Training
Administration and Management, for administrative hold procedures for medical reasons.
   1.8.1. Unit will notify AETC/A3FC (AETC.A3FC.Workflow@us.af.mil) when:
       1.8.1.1. UCT or PCS-to-training graduate students are on administrative hold for more
       than 30 calendar days, or may reach this threshold (reference paragraph 1.9.2).
       1.8.1.2. TDY-to-school funded students have a training delay over seven calendar days
       (reference paragraph 1.9.3).
       1.8.1.3. Primary phase UCT students are on administrative hold for an FA failure
       (reference paragraph 1.6.1).
AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                             11


       1.8.1.4. Advance phase UCT students are on administrative hold for failing to achieve an
       Excellent/Satisfactory score on their FA by their class graduation date (reference
       paragraph 1.6.2).
       1.8.1.5. Students are on administrative hold for medical reasons.
   1.8.2. AETC/A3FC notification will include:
       1.8.2.1. Student’s name and last four digits of SSN.
       1.8.2.2. Current class and scheduled course completion/graduation date.
       1.8.2.3. Date placed on hold and reason for training delay.
       1.8.2.4. Expected return to training date. (Update AETC/A3FC if this date changes.)
1.9. Training Delay:
   1.9.1. Medical. A UCT student requiring extended medical treatment beyond the assigned
   UCT class start date is administratively entered into training and placed into a duty not
   involving flying (DNIF) status on the class start date. Adhere to timelines for student
   administrative hold for medical disqualification and medical extensions according to AETCI
   48-102, Medical Management of Undergraduate Flying Training Students, and AETCI 36-
   2205, Volume 1.
   1.9.2. PCS-to-Training Students. If a student is on administrative hold for more than 30
   calendar days, or may reach this threshold, the assigned unit will notify AETC/A3FC
   (reference paragraph 1.8.2). Suspension of the student’s aeronautical orders and/or a CR may
   be warranted for students who spend extended time on administrative hold. Refer to the
   applicable syllabus for students returning to training.
   1.9.3. TDY-to-School Funded Students. The assigned training unit will notify
   AETC/A3FC and AETC/FMAM of any student training delays over 7 calendar days and
   ensure the student’s orders are amended. (reference paragraph 1.8.2). AETC/A3FC will in
   turn notify AETC/A3R.
1.10. Students in Transition Status. Commanders will assign students awaiting PCS training,
eliminees, administrative hold, etc., to duties commensurate with their background, training, and
grade. Contact AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H for the disposition of ANG and AFRC students.

                                           Chapter 2

                                     TRAINING FOLDER

2.1. Introduction:
   2.1.1. Each student must have a training folder. The training folder consists of the electronic
   Training Integration Management System (TIMS) training folder and other required training
   documents not maintained in TIMS (reference paragraph 2.2). If a backup version of the
   TIMS training folder is maintained, the unit stipulates procedures in local unit guidance. A
   student may only access his or her own training folder.
   2.1.2. In addition to the training folder, the FLT/CC will maintain personal information
   folders (if required) on students to protect information of a personal nature, inappropriate for
   public access, or sensitive in nature, and thus not appropriate for the training folder. Use AF
   Form174, Record of Individual Counseling or AETC Form 173, Student Record of Academic
   Counseling and Comments, to record counseling entries maintained in the personal
   information folder. Annotate on an AF Form 4293, Student Activity Record, in the student’s
   training folder when a counseling session is conducted.
   2.1.3. The FLT/CC will ensure training folders and personal information folders are secured
   to prevent unauthorized access.
   2.1.4. Instructors will ensure each aircraft, aircrew training device (ATD), academic and
   ground training event is recorded in the training folder.
   2.1.5. Units will establish procedures to conduct periodic student training folder reviews to
   ensure accurate and complete documentation of each student’s training.
2.2. Contents. Include the following items in the training folder, as applicable.
   2.2.1. AETC Form 101, Student Performance Summary. (Note: A memorandum for record
   (MFR) maintained in TIMS may be substituted for the AETC Form 101.)
   2.2.2. AF Form 4293. (TIMS)
   2.2.3. Academic examination grades summary. (TIMS)
   2.2.4. Grade sheets. (TIMS)
       2.2.4.1. Instructors will provide postflight comments in the comment column of the
       grade sheet on individual maneuvers. Write comments in a way that provides continuity
       from one instructor pilot (IP)/instructor CSO (ICSO) to the next and alerts IPs/ICSOs to
       the areas and objectives they should concentrate on for the ensuing sortie. As a minimum,
       provide comments for any maneuver graded below a previously required maneuver item
       file (MIF) proficiency level unless already documented on an AF Form 4293. For
       graduate CSO training courses, postflight comments are required only on items graded
       below MIF, if in the instructor’s judgment the student may have difficulty meeting MIF
       by the end of the category. Ensure comments are consistent with assigned grades and the
       course training standards (CTS).
AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                              13


       2.2.4.2. As a minimum, under the Comments/Attachments tab in TIMS, instructors will
       include the mission profile, overall assessment of the student’s characteristic
       performance, and any recommendations for the next IP/ICSO.
   2.2.5. CR process paperwork.
   2.2.6. Messages (ANG and AFRC, if applicable).
   2.2.7. Student officer’s biography (optional).
   2.2.8. Grade report for each category and training medium. (TIMS)
   2.2.9. Record of emergency procedure (EP) training. (TIMS)
   2.2.10. Record of special syllabus requirement accomplishment. (TIMS)
2.3. Documentation. Accurate documentation of the student’s performance is a core
competency and integral to the student training process. Failure to do so places the integrity of
the training program at risk, fails to portray an accurate picture of the student’s actual
performance, and improperly influences class ranking. Instructors will use an AF Form 4293 to
document student training according to the applicable syllabus and this instruction. Include all
AF Form 4293 entries in the student’s training folder. Instructors will provide a concise
summary of the student’s training and ensure entries clarify any training action. Begin each entry
with date of the event, subject or syllabus lesson numbers, overall lesson grade, and lesson
duration (if applicable). End the entry with the name, grade, and duty title of the instructor
making the entry. The student, student’s assigned IP/ICSO, and the FLT/CC must initial all AF
Form 4293 entries. Documentation is required for the following:
   2.3.1. Administrative hold.
   2.3.2. Temporary medical disqualification [DNIF]. Units may substitute a scanned or
   electronic copy of the AF FORM 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special
   Operational Duty, in the TIMS training folder for the AF Form 4293 entry.
   2.3.3. Failure of any academic examination, category check, flight evaluation, simulator
   evaluation, PC or EC.
   2.3.4. Counseling session.
   2.3.5. Assignment to and removal from the commander’s awareness program (CAP).
   2.3.6. Training folder review prior to a PC, EC, or CR. The reviewing instructor documents
   any training anomalies, syllabus deviations, etc that were not previously documented.
   2.3.7. Incomplete lessons.
   2.3.8. Authorization for additional training (AT). The authorization authority identifies the
   reasons for an AT sortie and sign or initial the entry.
   2.3.9. Substandard performance occurring on an AT sortie.
   2.3.10. Entry into the CR process and elimination from or reinstatement into training.
   2.3.11. Syllabus deviations.
   2.3.12. Syllabus entry prerequisite waiver or syllabus waiver (required if AETC Form 6,
   Waiver Request is not included in the electronic training folder).
 14                                               AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013


   2.3.13. Airsickness or G-induced loss of consciousness (GLOC) episodes.
   2.3.14. Unusual occurrences that could affect the student’s progress.
   2.3.15. Lessons graded overall fair (F) or unsatisfactory (U). Instructors will identify and
   document all maneuvers graded below a previously required MIF and any weak areas that
   need to be highlighted using the cause-and-effect format to document the substandard
   performance and identify the root cause. Each MIF item will be addressed separately. Do not
   use a MIF item to justify a downgrade of other MIF item(s) without a corresponding down
   grade of the first MIF item. Avoid bundling multiple MIF items under a single MIF item.
   2.3.16. Results of the training review for students projected to exceed the syllabus maximum
   flying hour or sortie threshold. If the syllabus does not identify a maximum threshold, use
   115 percent as a guide for that syllabus.
   2.3.17. Training folder closeout statement. Include a closeout statement in every training
   folder. If the student was eliminated/withdrawn from training, state so in the statement.
   Include the student’s major weapon system (MWS) assignment, if matched.
2.4. Student Training Records Disposition. A student usually obtains his or her training
records during out-processing and hand-carry them to his or her gaining unit. If the record is
incomplete when the graduate departs, the training unit will forward the training record to the
gaining unit via certified or electronic mail within 10 duty days of the student’s graduation. The
training unit will use appropriate E-mail encryption features to properly safeguard information
sent electronically and will verify the electronic file is received. Refer to Figure 2.1 for the
appropriate distribution of training documents, including forms, records, and reports. Upon
completion of training or disenrollment, the training unit will maintain the student’s records
according to AETCI 36-2223, Flying Training Student Information Management.
2.5. Training Documents. The group commander will standardize student documentation and
content. The following documentation is required:
   2.5.1. Aeronautical Orders. The local HARM office publishes aeronautical orders
   according to AFI 33-328, Administrative Orders, and AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist
   Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges.
   2.5.2. AF FORM 174 or AETC Form 173. Use these forms to document counseling
   sessions concerning sensitive personal problems. Keep these forms in the personal
   information folders maintained by the FLT/CC.
   2.5.3. AF FORM 475, Education/Training Record. Prior to course completion resulting in
   a change of station, the losing unit will complete an AF Form 475. The wording for
   comments on the AF Form 475 should be similar to an officer performance report and signed
   by the SQ/DO or higher.
   2.5.4. AF Form 1256. Award this form to graduates of AETC formal flying training
   courses.
   2.5.5. AETC Form 6. This form is used for all waiver requests. WG/CC is actively
   involved and participates in all assignment actions affecting UCT students, including any
   associated waiver requests. Route waiver requests through the SQ/CC, group commander,
   and WG/CC. WG/CCs requesting waivers to major weapon system (MWS) assignment
AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                15


   processes must submit their recommendations through AETC/A3F to AETC/A2/3/10.
   Completing this form is self-explanatory.
   2.5.6. AETC Form 31, Certificate of Aeronautical Rating. Award an AETC Form 31 to
   UCT graduates. Completing this form is self-explanatory.

Figure 2.1. Training Document Distribution.

  2.5.7. AETC Form 101. Generate an AETC Form 101 for any student placed on CAP. The
  form is a permanent part of the student’s training record. Specify documented military
  deficiencies. These deficiencies may include unexcused tardiness or absences, traffic tickets,
  unaccompanied quarters inspection failures, weight program, violations, and dress and
  appearance according to AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force
  Personnel. Units may maintain an MFR in the student’s TIMS training folder in lieu of the
  AETC Form 101. The MFR must address all areas listed on the AETC Form 101.
  2.5.8. AETC Form 240-5. Use the following guidance to ensure the AETC Form 240-5
  provides an accurate record of training and appropriately documents accomplishments in
  UCT courses:
     2.5.8.1. Generate a form for each student who enters the UCT course.
     2.5.8.2. Enter remarks on the form for outstanding achievements or awards, such as,
     distinguished graduate and any other pertinent information to indicate the student’s
     performance, progress, or achievements during the course.
     2.5.8.3. The Chief, Host Aviation Resource Manager signs the “authentication” block.
  2.5.9. AETC Form 298, Flight Briefing Critique. (Primary UCT only) Use AETC Form
  298 to critique daily flight briefings. Supervisors will complete the form to provide feedback
  to the FLT/CC. Rate all areas observed during the briefing.
  2.5.10. AETC Form 499, Distinguished Graduate Certificate. This form is presented to
  students selected for distinguished graduate (DG) status.
  2.5.11. AF Form 4293. This form is used to document information in a student’s training
  folder.
  2.5.12. AETC Form 1121. (As applicable based on student assignment.) This form
  provides follow-on training instructors and supervisors with an assessment of the student’s
  overall ability and characteristic performance during training. The undergraduate flying
  training unit will prepare the form on each UCT graduate. This form is not a part of the
  graduate’s permanent record.
     2.5.12.1. Maneuver Assessment. Place an “X” in the appropriate block for each
     maneuver. If a maneuver was not flown or observed, leave the blocks blank.
     2.5.12.2. Flight Commander Assessment. Provide a subjective assessment of the
     graduate’s overall airmanship and ability. Identify any areas that may require special
     attention or supervision. Comment on the graduate’s officer qualities only if appropriate
     as they relate to or affect training and performance.

                                 STUDENT MANAGEMENT

3.1. Commander’s Awareness Program (CAP): Reference AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1. The
SQ/CC will be briefed prior to removing a student from CAP.
3.2. Progress Checks (PC) and Elimination Checks (EC). PCs/ECs are full mission-profile
sorties during which a student’s performance is observed, rated potential is evaluated, and ability
to complete the course within syllabus constraints is considered. Conduct PCs/ECs according to
the applicable syllabus. PCs/ECs are separate from the normal syllabus flow. Students must
demonstrate proficiency on the PC/EC to the current stage of training. PCs/ECs are key events in
the CR process. Triggers for these events are defined in the applicable syllabus.
   3.2.1. Authorized PC/EC instructors. Only duly appointed and qualified instructors may
   administer a PC/EC. Refer to the applicable syllabus for authorized PC/EC instructors.
   Normally do not fly the student with the same PC/EC instructor on consecutive and/or
   subsequent PC/EC sorties.
   3.2.2. Ground Evaluation. PC/EC ground evaluations may be conducted as a result of a
   failed category check/PC/EC for unsatisfactory general knowledge, ground operations,
   mission planning, or EPs, or as the result of a FLT/CC-directed evaluation for failure to
   progress or meet syllabus standards in procedural knowledge (These evaluations may include
   a simulator mission.).
       3.2.2.1. The designated PC/EC instructor conducts the entire briefing, ground evaluation
       execution, debriefing, and assign the overall grade.
       3.2.2.2. The ground evaluation should be one to two hours in length and of sufficient
       breadth and depth to evaluate the student’s overall procedural knowledge.
   3.2.3. Simulator:
       3.2.3.1. During PCs/ECs, civilian simulator instructors (CSI) will serve only as console
       operators. Their participation is limited to assisting the PC/EC instructor with operating
       the simulator to facilitate mission execution.
       3.2.3.2. The PC/EC instructor will brief the assigned CSI separately on mission
       objectives, mission profile, event flow, desired scenarios, and areas of student weakness.
       The actual student mission briefing, execution, debriefing, assignment of individual
       grades, and assessment of overall student performance is the sole responsibility of the
       designated PC/EC instructor.
       3.2.3.3. The PC/EC instructor will not substitute a simulator PC/EC for a syllabus-
       directed aircraft sortie.
   3.2.4. Grading. Grade PCs/ECs according to syllabus guidance.
   3.2.5. Incomplete PC/EC. The PC/EC instructor determines if the sortie is complete. A
   PC/EC is “Incomplete” only if the mission tasks and objectives could not be completed to
   ascertain a reasonable evaluation of student performance.
 18                                              AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013


   3.2.6. Continuation Training (CT) Meetings. The SQ/CC or designated PC/EC program
   manager conducts PC/EC instructor CT meetings at least quarterly to ensure command and
   squadron PC/EC philosophy is implemented and standardized. As a minimum, each meeting
   should include a review of pass and fail rates by individual PC/EC instructors over the last
   quarter and year-to-date, quarterly and annual PC/EC pass and fail rates, and at least one
   grading scenario brought to a conclusion and documented in the meeting minutes. Grading
   scenarios should generate thoughtful discussion and reference to the individual CTS
   appropriate for the scenario. Document the meetings in sufficient detail such that those who
   are unable to attend can read and initial the meeting minutes, and understand what transpired.
3.3. Commander’s Review Process:
   3.3.1. Overview. The CR recommends the student’s elimination or retention in training. All
   students in a formal flying training course will go through a CR before being eliminated or
   removed from training. Complete the CR process within 10 duty days from the date the
   initiating authority (IA) signs the AETC Form 143, Record of Commander’s Review Action
   (ABM/CSO).
   3.3.2. Entry. The IA will enter the student in the CR process NLT three duty days after
   meeting the syllabus trigger. Remove the student from training pending final approving
   authority (AA) decision. The IA may elect to continue the student in academic training with
   reviewing authority (RA) concurrence. Instruct students not to attend flight line activities
   (aircraft or simulator) until reinstated. Students projected to exceed the syllabus maximum
   sortie or flying hour threshold because of overall poor performance should be considered for
   a CR. If the syllabus does not identify a maximum threshold, use 115 percent as a guide for
   that syllabus. SQ/CCs will consider entering UCT students into the CR process if they fail
   three flight/simulator checks or a combination of four flight/simulator checks, PCs and or
   ECs during the same phase of training.
   3.3.3. IA. The SQ/CC conducting the student’s syllabus training is the IA. The IA will:
      3.3.3.1. Notify the student in writing of the consideration for elimination and briefs the
      student on the CR process (Figure 3.1). For ANG and AFRC students, refer to paragraph
      1.5.1
      3.3.3.2. Complete the IA portion of the CR Checklist and briefing guide (Figure 3.2).
   3.3.4. RA. The group commander is the RA. The RA will:
      3.3.4.1. Review the student’s training and recommend elimination from or retention in
      training. The group commander may delegate this authority to the deputy group
      commander, operations support SQ/CC, or any flying training SQ/CC (not to include the
      student’s SQ/CC). The RA examines the student’s training records and, as deemed
      necessary, interviews the student and FLT/CC or SQ/CC.
      3.3.4.2. Complete the RA portion of the CR Checklist (Figure 3.2).
      3.3.4.3. Suspend the CR if it becomes apparent that circumstances require convening an
      investigation under the provisions of AFI 51-602 or when information arises that would
      cause the student to be medically disqualified. Reconvene as appropriate to complete the
      CR process.
   3.3.5. AA. The WG/CC is the AA. The AA will:
AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013                                          19


      3.3.5.1. Complete the AA portion of the CR Checklist (Figure 3.2).
      3.3.5.2. List any authorized AT.

Figure 3.2. Commander’s Review Checklist and Briefing Guide.




      3.3.5.3. Will not recommend students eliminated for manifestation of apprehension
      (MOA), drop-on-request (DOR), or academics for any other flying training. The AA
      should consider the student’s motivation, situational awareness, task management skills,
      airmanship, and academic average when recommending eliminees for air battle
      management (ABM) training.
AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                              21


      3.3.5.4. Complete AETC Form 143, Section IV, for graduate training.
3.4. Student Eliminations:
   3.4.1. Students should be eliminated if they:
      3.4.1.1. Exhibit lack of adaptability (LOA), which is the inability to complete the course
      because of physical, psychological, or personality factors. LOA eliminees require an
      evaluation from both medical and rated personnel. This category includes airsickness,
      GLOC, and MOA. Medical and rated personnel conducting the evaluations will
      document the results in the student’s training folder. They will specify the physical,
      psychological, or personality factors that led to the LOA determination. In addition, they
      annotate specific deficiencies in Section IV of AETC Form 143.
      3.4.1.2. Fail to meet proficiency standards of the syllabus in flying, academics, or
      procedures.
      3.4.1.3. Fail to demonstrate the potential to complete the course within syllabus
      constraints.
      3.4.1.4. Receive punitive action under the articles of the UCMJ.
      3.4.1.5. Fail to meet standards prescribed in AFI 36-2905 and this publication.
   3.4.2. Students will be eliminated if they:
      3.4.2.1. DOR. The FLT/CC will counsel the student on the ramifications of DOR (i.e.,
      permanent disqualification from flying status, reclassification proceeding, and possible
      elimination from the Air Force) prior to entering him or her into a CR. Once the student
      is counseled and signs the AETC Form 143, he or she is ineligible for reinstatement.
      Note: UCT students with aeronautical rating cannot DOR and fall under the procedures
      in AFI 11-402.
      3.4.2.2. Become medically disqualified, unless a flight surgeon determines the
      disqualification may resolve within 12 months of the initial disqualification. In the latter
      instance, place the student in administrative hold status. Refer to AFI 48-123, AETCI 48-
      102, and AETCI 36-2205 Volume 1 for additional guidance. Note: For those students
      funded under the TDY-to-school program, the assigned unit will notify AETC/A3FC and
      AETC/FMAM as soon as the administrative hold status becomes probable.
      3.4.2.3. Initiate action to separate from the service.
      3.4.2.4. Get recalled by the parent unit, higher headquarters, or home country. Note:
      Units may not allow students to be recalled without prior coordination with AETC/A3F.
      3.4.2.5. Get involved in drug abuse substantiated by reliable evidence.
      3.4.2.6. Get adjudicated absent without leave, are confined, or have deserted.
      3.4.2.7. Become hospitalized for an extended period (as the WG/CC determines).
      Student may be considered for reinstatement at a later date.
      3.4.2.8. Demonstrate improper attitude or lack of responsibility toward assigned duties or
      obligations. This may include character disorders that raise doubt about the student’s
      fitness for training.
 22                                             AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013


       3.4.2.9. Fail two ECs in the same phase or fail three ECs total. AETC/A2/3/10 is waiver
       authority for this requirement.
   3.4.3. AETC/A3 staff will maintain entry, production and elimination data to ensure fairness
   and equitable opportunity for all flying training program candidates.
3.5. Student Dispositions:
   3.5.1. Students reinstated into training after a CR complete an EC following completion of
   any AT authorized by the AA in Section IV of AETC Form 143. Students reinstated after
   academic deficiencies must repeat the examination after appropriate AT. Students reinstated
   following a flying evaluation board complete AT directed by the final approval authority.
   3.5.2. After completing AETC Form 143, Section IV, units will process eliminated students
   under AFI 36-3206, AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers; AFI 36-2110, or the
   ETCA. Additionally, units process rated students according to AFI 11-402; and pipeline or
   PCS students through appropriate personnel channels.
3.6. CR Records Distribution:
   3.6.1. The school registrar or similarly designated authority will maintain original CR
   records according to RDS and distribute them within 10 duty days of CR completion. These
   records must be available for review.
   3.6.2. Units will distribute eliminated officers’ CR records as outlined in Table 3.1 and
   maintain them according to the RDS.
   3.6.3. The course registrar will ensure each elimination case is updated in the training
   management database with an elimination code.
   3.6.4. The servicing flight management office will update ARMS with the appropriate
   disqualification code.

                                           Chapter 4

                      MEDICAL MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS

4.1. General. This chapter establishes student management requirements for appropriate
medical and operations personnel. Operations and medical personnel must ensure commanders
are informed when students exhibit MOA symptoms or other medical conditions that affect daily
student training decisions. Supervisors must also strive to keep students motivated and flying on
a regular basis.
4.2. Airsickness Procedures for UCT Students:
   4.2.1. Students must meet MIF standards to continue flying training. Grade them against the
   absolute rating scale, regardless of the effects of airsickness. Early in the primary phase of
   UCT, the instructor may help students overcome the effects of airsickness by changing the
   profile or if necessary, terminating the mission. Use sortie termination as a last resort since
   continued exposure to the flight environment enhances physiological adaptation. As students
   progress in training, instructor assistance decreases. Airsickness experienced by the student
   does not necessarily warrant an overall grade of unsatisfactory. Consideration should be
   made for in-flight conditions, training accomplished, and whether or not the mission is
   terminated early.
   4.2.2. FLT/CCs and instructors will send students who experience active or passive
   airsickness to the flight surgeon for examination, counseling, and treatment as soon as
   practical and before the next aircraft or simulator sortie. Document all episodes of airsickness
   on AF Form 4293.
   4.2.3. While participating in the airsickness management program (AMP), students will
   continue the normal syllabus flow to include flying. AMP is outlined in AETCI 48-102.
   4.2.4. The FLT/CC will place primary phase students who become airsick on four or more
   sorties on CAP.
   4.2.5. Limit student pharmacological therapy to a maximum of three sorties.
   4.2.6. Commanders will process nonrated officers in UCT who cannot overcome airsickness
   problems according to AETCI 48-102.
   4.2.7. Commanders will process rated officers in UCT who cannot overcome airsickness
   problems according to AFI 48-123. Squadron supervisors should coordinate closely with the
   chief of aeromedical services for each of these special cases.
4.3. Airsickness Procedures for Graduate CSO Training Students:
   4.3.1. A student who experiences airsickness may not necessarily warrant an overall grade of
   unsatisfactory. Instructors should consider the inflight conditions, training accomplished, and
   whether or not the mission is terminated early to determine the final grade.
   4.3.2. Students must meet MIF standards to continue flight training.
   4.3.3. FLT/CCs and instructor will send students who experience active or passive
   airsickness to the flight surgeon for examination, counseling, and treatment as soon as
AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                               25


   practical and before the next aircraft or simulator sortie. Document all episodes of airsickness
   on AF Form 4293.
   4.3.4. While participating in AMP, students continue the normal syllabus flow to include
   flying. Limit student pharmacological therapy to a maximum of three sorties.
   4.3.5. Commanders process rated officers who cannot overcome airsickness problems
   according to AFI 48-123 and AFI 11-402. Squadron supervisors should coordinate closely
   with the chief of aeromedical services for each of these special cases.
4.4. Inflight G-Tolerance Problems. Reference AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1.

                                            Chapter 5

                                    STUDENT TRAINING

5.1. Flight Commander Responsibilities. The FLT/CC is the first echelon of command
responsible for safely and efficiently scheduling people, mission and aircraft. The FLT/CC must
know the capabilities and experience levels of all flight members, and ensure they fly the right
mission at the right time according to applicable syllabuses and directives. Safety must remain
paramount in the FLT/CC’s mind. FLT/CCs will keep the operations supervisors informed of the
training plan and any changes, and:
   5.1.1. Supervise and monitor student training.
   5.1.2. Assist students and supervisors with the training review process and provide for
   discipline, physical and mental well-being, and general welfare of students. The FLT/CC
   must be aware of each student’s progress in all areas, including the potential effect of
   external factors (personal problems, etc.). FLT/CCs help students when they:
       5.1.2.1. Counsel students determined to be marginal performers or those placed on CAP
       and conduct follow-up counseling as often thereafter as necessary.
       5.1.2.2. Counsel students as necessary, on appropriate management issues, including
       personal problems and disciplinary matters. If additional assistance is necessary, refer
       students to the appropriate base support agencies (Chaplain, Legal Office, etc.).
   5.1.3. Maintain student training folders according to Chapter 2 of this instruction, local
   guidance, and the applicable syllabus.
   5.1.4. Ensure student compliance and documentation of PT accomplishments.
   5.1.5. Coordinate with academic supervisors on individual student performance.
   5.1.6. Ensure students are briefed on assignment opportunities as applicable.
   5.1.7. Brief student leaders on the scope and limits of their responsibilities.
   5.1.8. Assist in syllabus-directed functions.
5.2. Syllabus Resource Management. The FLT/CC and SQ/CC are responsible for the
management of student flight hours. Each syllabus category has an associated number of sorties
or missions and flight hours. On average, the syllabus mission and any AT, PC, or EC sorties
should reflect the average mission duration (AMD) for the category of training. Instructors
should closely adhere to the syllabus AMD. The AMD should not be exceeded except for
extenuating circumstances or to meet training objectives.
5.3. Additional Training Sorties. AT sorties provide extra training to students in specific
circumstances to include check failure, break-in-training, CR reinstatement, syllabus waiver,
group commander corrective actions, or as otherwise specifically authorized by the syllabus.
Refer to the applicable syllabus for authorized AT sorties and specific guidelines.
   5.3.1. Adaptation to Corrective Lenses (Coded XXX84). These sorties are authorized for
   students who experience training difficulties and require corrective lenses.
AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 27


   5.3.2. Warm-up/Break-in-Training (Coded XXX86). These sorties are authorized for delays
   in training and will be flown only when remaining syllabus sorties are insufficient to
   compensate for the student’s break in training. Instructors should consider using the
   simulator instead of the aircraft if appropriate.
   5.3.3. Reinstatement by CR (Coded XXX87). These sorties may be authorized for students
   reinstated into training after a CR.
   5.3.4. Prior to PC and EC (Coded XXX87). These sorties may be authorized before a PC and
   EC. These sorties are not automatically given to every student. They are reserved for cases
   where the SQ/CC determines some training irregularity or anomaly has occurred, and the
   student has demonstrated the potential to complete the syllabus. Document the training
   irregularity or anomaly as part of the AF Form 4293 AT authorization entry.
   5.3.5. Q-2/Q-3 Flight Evaluation (Coded XXX87). These sorties may be authorized by the
   flight evaluator as a result of a Q-2/Q-3 flight evaluation.
5.4. Ground Training Unit (GTU):
   5.4.1. GTUs are instructional lessons that are normally prerequisites for simulator or aircraft
   missions and complement academic instruction.
   5.4.2. Instructors are responsible for teaching GTUs according to instructor guides.
   Instructors may teach the GTUs to students on an individual or group basis.
   5.4.3. Syllabus time for GTUs is an approximate time to complete the lesson. Log the
   completion time, date, and actual training time in TIMS.
5.5. Formal Flight Briefings. UCT flights will conduct a formal flight briefing at least once
per week while the students are on the flightline. This briefing may occur any time during the
duty day and cover appropriate administrative information, flight safety (weekly), ground safety
(at least monthly), standardization briefing (paragraph 5.7), and a cockpit/crew resource
management (CRM) topic (at least every other week according to paragraph 5.8). Brief
operations notes, weather, and notices to airmen in individual crew briefings. On the days a
group flight briefing is not accomplished, instructors will cover required information during
individual crew briefings.
5.6. Flying Safety Briefings. UCT flights will conduct these briefings at least once a normal
workweek. Briefings should emphasize aircraft mishap prevention and promote group discussion
to improve student judgment and confidence.
5.7. Standardization Briefings. Emphasize situational EPs to include overhead questioning
and group discussions of selected topics. Briefings should be structured to assist in the
development of judgment, proper application of procedures, and realistic use of available
publications. The standardization briefing should include a standup EP situation. UCT flights
conduct standardization briefings as part of the formal flight briefing at least three times during a
normal workweek throughout the program. The standardization briefings may be in conjunction
with formal flight briefing or at a time that ensures maximum instructor and student
participation.
5.8. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Briefings. AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource
Management Training Program, and its AETC Supplement outline requirements for the CRM
training program. CRM briefings address human-factor causes in aircraft mishaps. Use real-

world mishaps as examples in the briefings. Brief CRM to UCT students at least once every
other week. Brief and debrief CRM core concepts and skills on every aircraft and simulator
mission. CRM briefings may be substituted for safety or standardization briefings, but they are
not testable.
5.9. Mission Briefings. These briefings set the tone of the lesson. Cover specific objectives,
mission accomplishment, and specific flight or simulator restrictions. Discuss techniques and
procedures for flying the mission before or after the mission briefing. Post-mission briefings
measure the success in accomplishing the mission objectives. Refer to the appropriate AFI 11-
series publication for briefing formats. The applicable syllabus contains mission briefing
requirements.
5.10. Student Standardization Program. The standardization program consists of briefings
and tests to ensure students maintain the highest proficiency level in procedural knowledge and
application. The minimum passing score on all flight line tests is 85 percent and 100 percent for
Boldface tests. Refer to the applicable syllabus for additional guidance.
   5.10.1. All UCT flights administer a weekly emergency procedures quiz (EPQ) covering
   general and EP knowledge appropriate for the student’s stage of training. The EPQ may be
   administered in printed or electronic format. Printed EPQs will be numbered sequentially for
   accounting purposes. Immediately prior to administering the EPQ the test administrator will:
       5.10.1.1. Generate a fresh 20-question EPQ from the TIMS secure server with a
       representative number of questions from each assigned reading area.
       5.10.1.2. Secure the room and administer the EPQ.
       5.10.1.3. Collect any printed EPQs and answer sheets, and account for each numbered
       copy.
       5.10.1.4. Grade the EPQ; record the scores; and destroy all test copies, answer sheets, the
       answer key, transparencies, and/or electronic versions.
   5.10.2. The following are available to supplement the standardization program:
       5.10.2.1. AETC Form 46, T-6A Emergency Procedures. This form contains a list of
       EPs to cover during a T-6A course. In the blank space next to the specific EP, enter the
       date the EP situation was covered.
       5.10.2.2. Boldface emergency procedures and operating limitations worksheets are
       available on the AETC/A3V website at https://www-r.aetc.af.mil/do/dof/download.asp
5.11. Incomplete Sorties:
   5.11.1. Except for checks, PCs, and ECs, the FLT/CCs will determine if a sortie is
   incomplete. He or she will:
       5.11.1.1. Evaluate each situation on an individual basis. (Note: If a student has had
       ample opportunity to learn a task and subsequently flies a short sortie, do not incomplete
       the sortie. Also do not incomplete a lesson solely because an individual maneuver is
       omitted when the omitted maneuver can be accomplished on the next sortie without
       degrading accomplishment of future training objectives.)
AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                              29


       5.11.1.2. Consider the sortie’s effect on the quality of the student’s training and each
       student’s prior training opportunities as well as the remaining sorties available to
       accomplish training objectives. The syllabus provides a means for AT for students who
       do not progress to the end of category MIF proficiency requirements.
       5.11.1.3. Ensure both above- and below-average students are afforded the same training
       opportunities to refine their skills.
   5.11.2. Incomplete sorties do not break a string of unsatisfactory syllabus sorties.
5.12. Grading Procedures. Instructors will grade student training according to the applicable
syllabus. The CTS is the baseline for all maneuver grading. Instructors must compare Student
performance to the CTS before assigning maneuver grades. Overall lesson grades must be
consistent with syllabus guidance, the student’s documented progress, and overall performance.
5.13. Category Checks. Checks validate students have achieved the required proficiency
and/or instructional level for a category, are conducted according to the applicable syllabus, and
are graded against the course training standards using the required MIF proficiency and
instructional levels as the baseline.
   5.13.1. Profile. The check FLT/CC ensures a cross-section of maneuvers optioned in the
   category check MIF are regularly sampled on category checks.
   5.13.2. Grading. Checks are syllabus events and the CTS must be applied exactly as on
   daily events. The starting point for assigning any maneuver grade is the CTS which equates
   to satisfactory proficiency level or a letter grade of G. The instructor will grade student
   maneuvers according to the applicable syllabus, grading completed checks excellent (E),
   good (G), unsatisfactory (U) or NG (no grade) overall.
   5.13.3. Incomplete Checks. With SQ/CC approval, checks may be considered incomplete
   if no maneuver completed by the student was graded below MIF and either all required
   maneuvers were not flown or the number of maneuvers flown was insufficient to reasonably
   assess the student’s overall performance. If a check is incomplete, the student need only
   perform those maneuvers necessary to complete a normal check profile on the subsequent
   (refly) check.
5.14. Check Instructor CT Meetings. The group will conduct check instructor CT meetings at
least quarterly to ensure grading philosophy, practices and standards are consistent and
standardized. All individuals who conduct category checks are required to attend. As a
minimum, each meeting should include a review of pass and fail rates by category for each check
administered since the last CT meeting, check weak areas or trends, pass and fail rates of
individual check instructors, and at least one grading scenario brought to a conclusion.
Document the meetings in sufficient detail such that those who have an authorized absence can
read the meeting minutes and understand what transpired.
5.15. Flight Evaluations. Conduct flight evaluations according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2,
Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, its AETC Supplement, AFI 11-2MDS-specific
volumes 2, and the applicable syllabus.
5.16. Wash Back. When a student washes back into another class, the SQ/CC is the approving
authority for determining the appropriate TIMS version of the syllabus to use to continue the
student’s training.

5.17. Civilian Flight Training. To maintain the integrity of the AETC training system,
students rated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (private pilot, commercial pilot,
etc.) may fly civilian aircraft once they enter into UCT, but they may not pursue additional
ratings or qualifications. Students not rated by the FAA will not fly civilian aircraft after entering
into UCT. Prior to conducting any civilian flying, students will complete an AETC Form 410,
High-Risk Activities Worksheet, and submit the form for commander approval.
5.18. Flight Planning Software use in UCT. Flight instruction of flight planning principles in
UCT is tailored to each phase with the understanding that manual flight planning skills provide
the foundation for software-based flight planning skills.
   5.18.1. In the primary phase, the prescribed learning objectives focus on manual mission
   planning skills. Therefore, primary students will not use flight planning software for
   syllabus-directed events. However, primary instructors may use flight planning software to
   verify student flight planning computations.
   5.18.2. In the advanced phase, the initial focus is to reinforce the manual flight planning
   skills learned in the primary phase. After initial exposure and satisfactory manual flight
   planning performance is demonstrated, introduce flight planning software through
   courseware and ground training, then apply on the flight line. Specifically, students are
   required to plan and fly applicable sorties using manual or software-based flight planning
   methods according to syllabus requirements.
AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                           31


                                          Chapter 6

                       UCT STUDENT ASSIGNMENT PROCESS

6.1. Overview:
   6.1.1. Students receive MWS assignments based on demonstrated potential to
   successfully complete required follow-on training. MWS assignments consider three
   elements:
      6.1.1.1. Needs of the Air Force.
      6.1.1.2. Assignment availability.
      6.1.1.3. Student desires.
   6.1.2. To aid commanders in these decisions, merit assignment selection system (MASS), a
   command-directed performance measurement tool, is provided. MASS provides student
   relative ranking within his or her class and is used for student MWS assignment, and final
   graduation order of merit.
   6.1.3. The WG/CC is the approval authority for all MWS assignment decisions. Any waivers
   or deviations from this process must originate from the WG/CC for review by AETC/A3F.
6.2. Career Information:
   6.2.1. Before MWS assignment, the wing will provide students with MWS-specific career
   information. This information should help students make informed choices when requesting
   specific aircraft. Specific information should include mission duties, career path and
   advancement opportunities, and average TDY commitments.
   6.2.2. Present the information via briefings, career days, and/or other practical means. The
   wing should also consider sponsoring career day activities along with the base’s annual open
   house or airshow. UCT students will make their career requests on AF Form 3849,
   PME/AFIT/RTFB/Officer Worksheet, or local group commander-approved form. Note:
   Inform students with special-need dependents, join spouse, or other special circumstances to
   make these situations known to their chain of command.
6.3. Merit Assignment Selection System (MASS):
   6.3.1. The FLT/CC or appropriate squadron representative will present a comprehensive
   briefing to each class to ensure understanding of the MASS methodology. The FLT/CC or
   other appropriate squadron representative must ensure he or she subsequently briefs any
   student who is unavoidably absent.
   6.3.2. MASS generates a merit ranking which is an overall assessment of the student’s
   airmanship and capability based upon demonstrated performance. It includes the FLT/CC’s
   assessment of the student’s flying skills, leadership, teamwork, officership, attitude, and
   potential to complete follow-on training.
   6.3.3. A TIMS MASS transaction is required for each UCT class prior to MWS assignment.
   The group commander will ensure a finalized MASS is performed in TIMS.
 32                                               AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013


6.4. Computing MASS Standardized Scores. Use the following statistical methodology to
compute MASS standardized scores.

Figure 6.1. Mean ().




Note: N is the number of students in the class, and Xi is the individual’s score (academic
examination average, daily maneuver score, check score, etc.).

Figure 6.2. Standard deviation ().




Note: N and Xi are defined in Figure 6.1. and x is the mean score for the category (academic
examination average mean, daily maneuver score mean, check evaluation score mean).

Figure 6.3. Number of standard deviations from the mean (z-score).




   6.4.1. T-score: T = 50 + 10 (z-score) Figures 6.2 and 6.3. T-scores are weighted according
   to these calculations. Add the weighted T-scores to compute the total merit score.
   6.4.2. Compute maneuver (M) scores for daily flying and check performance based on
   Figure 6.4:

Figure 6.4. Formula for Computing maneuver scores.




       6.4.2.1. Each maneuver has scores for unsatisfactory, fair, good, and excellent. Critical
       maneuvers are weighted more heavily. Weighted grade values for individual maneuvers
       are available in the maneuver grade files. For an incomplete sortie or a PC/EC sortie
       following a failed category check, the maneuver score is based on the first graded attempt
       of the maneuver.
       6.4.2.2. AETC/A3FC determines subarea weights.
6.5. UCT Merit Ranking. Merit Assignment Selection System (MASS) tables are located on
the AETC/A3F website on the Air Force Portal. https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                             33

tables.
6.6. Example Calculation. This example calculates the T-6A total score for UCT. Similar
methodology applies to the other UCT phases.
   6.6.1. Category Check Maneuver Scores. Compute using percentage score, multiply by
   weighting factor, and total. Use this total to compute a T-score for category check
   maneuvers. Reference Figure 6.5

Figure 6.5. Category Check Maneuver Scores.




Note: Assuming the mean for this class’s category checks is 93.422 with a standard deviation of
3.270, then this student’s 95.451 total category check points yields a z-score of +0.6208,
resulting in a category check maneuver T-score of 56.208.
   6.6.2. Daily Performance Scores. Compute the daily performance scores using a T-score
   generated from student’s daily maneuver percentage score. Reference Figure 6.6

Figure 6.6. Daily Performance Scores.




Note: Assuming the mean for this class’s daily maneuvers is 71.237 and a standard deviation of
5.941, then this student’s 67.206 total points yields a z-score of –0.6783 resulting in a daily
maneuver T-score of 43.217.
   6.6.3. Academic Scores. Students’ academic test averages are used to compute their z-
   scores. Only the first test attempt counts in the student’s academic test average. Instructors
   ensure all retakes of failed academic tests are entered as retakes. Reference Figure 6.7
 34                                                AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013


Figure 6.7. Academic Scores.




Note: In this example, the student’s academic test average is 96.891. Assuming the class average
is 96.060 with a standard deviation of 1.886, then the resulting z-score is +0.4883 yielding an
academic T-score of 54.883.
   6.6.4. FLT/CC Ranking. Use the FLT/CC ranking scores to compute a z-score. In this
   example, we use a ranking of 5 out of 15 = 95.71. Reference Figure 6.8 and Table 6.1

Figure 6.8. FLT/CC Ranking.




Note: By design, the mean for all classes’ FLT/CC ranking is 92.50. However the standard
deviation varies depending on class size. In this case, we use a standard deviation of 4.652; then
this student’s 95.710 yields a z-score of +0.690, resulting in a FLT/CC ranking T-score of
56.900.

Figure 6.9. Total Computation.




6.7. UCT Student Assignment Process. After receiving assignments from AFPC/DPALT and
not later than 2 weeks before the scheduled assignment night, AETC/A1KO will provide the
479 FTG with the assignments. The 479 FTG/CCs may also request the assistance of
AETC/A1KO to obtain to obtain an appropriate MWS assignment based on a suitable match
with the student's skill and potential. Assignment night is no later than 1 week before graduation.
   6.7.1. Merit Order Calculation. The 479 FTG will compute the merit order for all 479
   FTG U.S. students. Contact AETC/A3F for MASS calculation questions.
AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                              35


  6.7.2. Before assignment night, all students will complete AF Form 3849 or local group
  commander-approved form, indicating (in order) their choice of MWS aircraft.
  6.7.3. The SQ/CC and FLT/CCs will convene and assign students MWS aircraft.
     6.7.3.1. Rank students in merit order for MWS aircraft. Reference Figure 6.9. for Phase
     Total Computation.
     6.7.3.2. If available, the top 10 percent of graduates should receive their first choice. For
     example, in a class of 15 students, the top 10 percent would be 1.5 students. Round
     numbers .5 and above to the next higher number, making the top 10 percent (in this
     example) two students.
     6.7.3.3. Use the rank order listing and the student’s AF Form 3849 to provide the best
     match of the student’s desires with available MWS aircraft. If a student’s first choice is
     not available, go to the second (third, etc.) choice until a match is found.
  6.7.4. The 12 FTW/CC is actively involved in actions affecting CSO students in the
  assignment selection process and makes the final decision on the best match of student skill,
  potential, and desire with available aircraft. The 12 FTW/CC will provide a list of finalized
  assignment selections and merit rank order to AETC/A1KO not later than one duty day
  before the scheduled assignment night.
  6.7.5. AETC/A1KO will check selections for potential errors and coordinate with the 479
  FTG for final assignment release. AETC/A1KO will then forward assignment matches to
  AFPC/DPALT no later than the following Monday after assignment night.
  6.7.6. Squadron supervisors will establish procedures to announce assignment drops. In
  addition, they will closely monitor student performance after MWS assignment.
  6.7.7. When appropriate, squadron, group, and wing personnel will work with AETC/A1KO
  to coordinate any assignment changes necessitated by post-MWS assignment performance.

                                    STUDENT AWARDS

Section 7A—UCT

7.1. Overview. The WG/CC will establish and maintain a program to present awards to
students selected as outstanding in academics, military qualities, and flying training. Duplicate
awards may be presented for ties. AFI 36-2805, Special Trophies and Awards, governs
appropriations for such awards. A wing awards council or similar process nominates and selects
students for awards approved by the WG/CC.
7.2. Distinguished Graduate (DG) Awards. The group commander may select DGs from the
students in each class and present them a plaque and the AETC/A2/3/10 memorandum of
recognition during graduation. For each class, the group commander is the final approving
authority for all awards. As a minimum, a DG award requires a student to be in the upper 10
percent of the graduating class using the final MASS score. If a DG is an ANG or AFRC
member, notify AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H, as appropriate, as soon as possible to ensure
appropriate representation.
7.3. AETC Commander’s Trophy. This award is presented to the student in each class with
the highest MASS score using the combined MASS data from the primary and advanced phases
of UCT. The WG/CC (or designated representative) will present the trophy during the graduation
ceremony. The trophy is an 8-inch tall, weathered brass finish statue of an eagle, mounted on a
wood base approximately 5 inches by 5 inches wide and 4 inches tall. A suitable brass plate is
attached to the base and engraved as follows in Figure 7.1:

Figure 7.1. AETC Commander’s Trophy Plate.




7.4. Academic and Flying Training Awards. The academic training award is presented to the
student in each track with the highest academic MASS score for the primary and advanced
phases. The flying training award is presented to the student with the highest combined daily
sortie and check sortie MASS scores for both the primary and advanced phases. The group
commander is the approving authority for these awards.

Section 7B—Graduate Training

7.5. DG Awards:
38                                              AETCI36-2205VOL5 4 SEPTEMBER 2013


  7.5.1. Units develop their own methods of identifying up to the top 10 percent of students in
  basic courses as DGs. Classes of less than 10 may have one DG. Any fractions may be
  rounded upward. Commanders may elect not to designate a DG in a class.
  7.5.2. DG programs recognize students who clearly excel during formal training. Formalize
  the DG program in local guidance. DGs must demonstrate outstanding progress in each phase
  of academic, simulator, and flying training, and outstanding results in flying and simulator
  evaluations. The unit commander is the final approving authority for all awards.
  7.5.3. The DG will receive an AETC Form 499 (or locally approved substitute) signed by
  the unit CC and DO.
