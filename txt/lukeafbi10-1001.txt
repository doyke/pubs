                                  PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

1.1. Implementation. This instruction will be executed under the following conditions:

1.1.1. Air or ground training support (including Forward Air Controller, Similar or Dissimilar
Air Combat Training (DACT), Joint Tactical Air Controller, etc.) required to accomplish AETC
syllabus training objectives.

1.1.2. Air National Guard/AF Reserve units visit Luke AFB to conduct training.

1.1.3. Air units tasked by higher headquarters performing classified or unclassified duties at
Luke AFB that are not in direct support of the 56 FW flying mission.

1.2. Key Assumptions.

1.2.1 Either the 56 FW, the visiting unit, or higher headquarters (HHQ) will provide funding
requirements for lodging, transportation (rental vehicles), fuel, maintenance, parts, etc. Funding
will be agreed upon before approval is given for a visiting unit to support flying requirements.

1.2.2. Due to limited space for transient aircraft, visiting units will coordinate aircraft and
support equipment parking with Airfield Management (56 OSS/OSAA) as soon as possible.

1.2.3. Visiting units need to provide their own maintenance and personnel support to the
maximum extent possible due to limited 56 FW resources. Requirements for maintenance
equipment must be coordinated through the host squadron before the visiting unit arrives.

1.2.4. Visiting units must be willing to support 56 FW syllabus training. Those units not
supporting syllabus training will operate during published airfield hours and will not interfere
with the mission of the 56 FW.

1.3. Tasks.

1.3.1. The 56 FW/CC is the approval authority for potential visiting unit requests and delegates
responsibility for hosting visiting units to the 56th Operations Group (56 OG). Additionally, the
56 FW/CC will designate the 56th Mission Support Group (56 MSG) as OPR for other than
flying requirements.

1.3.2. The 56 OG/CC will appoint a host squadron for the visiting unit, designate the 56 OSS as
OPR for flying support coordination, and in conjunction with the 56 MXG/CC
approve/disapprove transient local sortie requests.

1.3.3. The 56 OSS will provide support for visiting units flying requirements to include: a
sufficient work area for operations and maintenance personnel, suitable ramp space with tie
down capability, intelligence support for tactical air-to-ground missions, weather and base

(OPR) for initiation of the coordination procedures listed in this instruction. 56 OSS/OSK is
responsible for any necessary revisions to this instruction.

1.3.5.1. 56 OSS/OSK will assist the 56 OG in assigning a host squadron by contacting flying
squadrons to determine DACT support needs. 56 OSS/OSK will contact appropriate agencies
listed in Attachment 4 to fill support requirements. Additionally, 56 OSS/OSK will ensure the
following: ramp space available to support visiting unit requirements, pre-approved funding, and
adequate lodging and transportation availability. If these items are available and sufficient, OSK
will initiate an electronic Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) for coordination and approval with the
agencies listed in Attachment 4.

1.3.5.2. Once the deployment is approved by the 56 FW/CC, 56 OSS/OSK will notify the host
squadron. The designated host squadron will appoint a squadron project officer and forward
his/her name, rank, and duty phone number to 56 OSS/OSO and 56 OSS/OSK. In addition, the
host squadron will ensure coordination for the visiting unit IAW Attachment 1.

1.3.6. The host squadron project officer (HPO) represents the 56 FW/CC in hosting the visiting
unit. HPO duties take precedence over all other duties except flying duties. Regular leave or
TDY should not be scheduled for the HPO during this period. HPO responsibilities are IAW
Attachment 2 and 3.

1.3.7. The 56 MXG/CC will delegate responsibility for visiting unit maintenance to the host
squadron AMU. The host squadron AMU will appoint a project officer/NCO for visiting units
and provide requested support to visiting unit maintenance. The project officer/NCO will
coordinate with the visiting unit and hosting AGE Flight to determine AGE support
requirements. If the AGE support requirements exceed the capabilities of Luke AFB, the visiting
unit will be required to bring enough support equipment and AGE personnel for servicing and
deliver of required assets.

                                         OPERATIONS

2.1. Concept of Operations. The missions and operations of visiting units will vary, and
planning for support must be flexible to accommodate each visiting unit’s specific requirements.

2.1.1. The OPR is responsible for planning, implementing, and executing the 56 FW hosting
procedures in support of a visiting unit. All requirements must be coordinated prior to the arrival
of the visiting unit.

2.1.2. Any 56 FW or tenant unit that receives a request for host support from an external
organization will immediately refer them to 56 OSS/OSK.

2.1.3. Implement this instruction when two or more aircraft deploy with support personnel to
Luke AFB utilizing Luke facilities (i.e., ranges, airspace, ramp space, etc.).

2.2. Limiting Factors. Visiting units will bring sufficient maintenance personnel and technical
data to support sortie generation. Transient Alert will not provide support to visiting units for
local missions.

2.2.1. The 56 MXG/CC and 56 OG/CC must approve units, not directly supporting syllabus
training, to fly local sorties.

2.2.2. 56 FW airfield hours are limited. Normal operating hours are Monday through Thursday,
0630-2230L, and Friday, 0630-1830L, Closed weekends and holidays (Refer to the U.S. IFR
Supplement). Requests for flights outside of normal operating hours will normally not be
approved unless they are directly supporting 56 FW training. These requests require 56 OG/CC
approval and must be coordinated through 56 OSS/OSA at least three weeks in advance.

2.3. Tactical Air Control Operations. The F-16 training syllabi recommends the use of
Airborne Forward Air Controllers (FAC-A) or JTACs, when available, during Close Air Support
missions. When a unit deploys to Luke AFB to provide FAC-A support for F-16 syllabus
training or continuation training requirements, the 56 OG/CC will appoint an HPO to ensure
thorough coordination with the FAC-A unit. Refer to the basic instruction, paragraph 1.3.5 and
1.3.6 and Attachment 2 for host squadron and HPO duties.

2.4. Air Combat Training. This section applies when hosting DoD and Allied visiting units
supporting DACT syllabus requirements or Instructor Continuation Training at Luke.

2.4.1. The host squadron will coordinate ACMI pod requirements for visiting units through
56 RMO/ACTS for contract pod support and Weapons and Tactics Element (56 OSS/OSK).

2.4.2. The HPO will coordinate with the ACMI contractor (ext. 6509) for the delivery of ACMI
pods, loading, downloading, and return after the last ACMI mission each day.
