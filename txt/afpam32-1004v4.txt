Chapter 2           CEMAS Overview and Responsibilities
2.1   Overview                     The computerized system used by the Material Acquisition
                                   element is CEMAS. The purpose of CEMAS is to provide
                                   users a responsive material acquisition system with accu-
                                   rate accountability of material and to incorporate maximum
                                   use of commercial supply inventories. The system inte-
                                   grates data from planners, work centers, funds, material
                                   acquisition, and other real property maintenance functions
                                   into a common database. It also provides accurate reporting
                                   and management information by reducing the requirement
                                   for manual records.

                                   CEMAS is a menu-driven subsystem of WIMS divided into
                                   functional areas used by BCE personnel to identify, ac-
                                   quire, and store material requirements in support of the op-

                                   The system supports the BCE by providing a mixture of on-
                                   line and end-of-session computer processes. The on-line
                                   processes permit records to be added and file maintenance
                                   to be performed using remote terminals. A wide range of
                                   on-line functions is provided to include individual inquir-
                                   ies, specialized inquiries, schedule reviews, forecasting,
                                   and material issues and transfers. CEMAS provides:
                                   (1)    item identification by noun, part number, CEMAS
                                          stock list number (CSL), and national stock number
                                          (NSN);
                                   (2)    automated development of bills-of-material;
                                   (3)    automated inventory controls;
                                   (4)    programmatic transfer of assets; and
                                   (5)    automated funds control.
                                   The WIMS administrator is responsible for computer sys-
                                   tem security per AFSSI 5100.

2.2   System Management            The Chief of Material Acquisition Element is the coordina-
      and Responsibilities         tion point for the entire CEMAS to include CEMAS funds,
                                   security, noun creation, and the maintenance of files proc-
                                   essed by this subsystem. The Chief of Material Acquisition
                                   determines what reports are to be produced by placing a
                                   "Y" next to the report name on the set report screen. End-
                                   of-session frequency is identified by selecting the appropri-
                                   ate code on the Menu for Logistics Management Office. It

                                is very important to set the correct frequency before end-of-
                                session processing.

                                Main store personnel maintain inventory levels on store
                                stock items and generate purchase requests and material
                                issue transactions. Holding area personnel maintain ac-
                                countability for line items being received and accumulated
                                for work orders. Residue area personnel maintain on-line
                                inventories of excess items available for issue to work or-
                                ders or for turn in to Base Supply or the DRMO. Receiving
                                area personnel generate receiving records, update due in
                                files, and produce material receipt transactions for all in-
                                coming items. Operations Flight personnel operate and
                                manage the flow of work requests and work authorizations.
                                Planners identify all material and equipment and create bill-
                                of-material records for all planned work orders. Buyers
                                create and maintain contracting information such as ob-
                                taining vendor data, buying abstracts, preparing purchase
                                orders, and initiating follow-up action as required.

2.3   CEMAS Data                CEMAS on-line inputs consist of transactions to add, in-
      Processing                quire, update, or delete records in the CEMAS database.
                                Material Acquisition personnel enter transactions with an
                                on-line remote terminal. A menu system with formed
                                screens helps ease data entry and subsystem processing.
                                Interfaces with WIMS, BCAS, and Standard Base Supply
                                System (SBSS) occur real time or during end-of-session
                                processing. CEMAS outputs consist of management prod-
                                ucts, remote responses to terminal inputs, update transac-
                                tions, and end-of-session products and tapes. The responses
                                are in the form of accepted and rejected messages and man-
                                agement notices. Management products are assigned prod-
                                uct control numbers (PCN) and produced daily during end-
                                of-session processing or when on-line. On-line products are
                                automatically printed to pre-identified printers.

                                                           NOTE
                                  Monthly and quarterly management products will not
                                  be produced until the appropriate end-of-session is
                                  processed. Failure to run end-of-quarter will preclude
                                  consumption data from being calculated and prevent
                                  the main store program from reordering and main-
                                  taining needed assets.

Chapter 3           CEMAS Access
3.1   User Authorization           Individuals receive access to CEMAS based on need. To
                                   prevent the possibility of fraud, waste, or abuse, unlimited
                                   access to perform functions such as requisitioning, issuing,
                                   receiving, or performing inventory adjustments, should not
                                   be granted to any one individual. User authorization pro-
                                   vides on-line identification of personnel authorized to
                                   withdraw material from the CEMAS stores and holding ar-
                                   eas in support of valid work orders. The identification file
                                   also identifies who is authorized to manage, update, and
                                   modify BCE CEMAS files.

                                   The Chief of Material Acquisition is responsible for grant-
                                   ing access to CEMAS and identifying and deleting those
                                   individuals who are no longer authorized access to
                                   CEMAS. The Chief of Material Acquisition may designate,
                                   in writing, one alternate person to perform this task in the
                                   absence of the Chief. The WIMS system administrator is
                                   responsible for overall WIMS system security, ensuring
                                   only authorized personnel are making changes to CEMAS.

                                   Each time a record in the identification file is modified, it is
                                   recorded on the functional access code changes listing. The
                                   Chief of Material Acquisition and WIMS system adminis-
                                   trator review this listing to ensure system integrity.

3.2   CEMAS Access                 The CEMAS access codes (Table 1, Recommended Access
      Codes                        Codes for Functional Users and Table 2, CEMAS Access
                                   Codes by Functional Areas) are available for use. The
                                   Chief of Material Acquisition ensures only authorized indi-
                                   viduals have access to specific files.

                                                            CAUTION
                                     Individuals receive access to CEMAS based on need.
                                     To prevent the possibility of fraud, waste, or abuse,

Chapter 4           Research
                                Requisitioning of material for the BCE is primarily from
                                three sources:
                                (1)    SBSS,
                                (2)    COCESS, and
                                (3)    local purchase (LP).

4.1   Sources of Supply         BCE and other personnel use the SBSS to order material
                                such as equipment, plywood, and individual equipment
                                items from the individual equipment unit (IEU). COCESS
                                is a store where a civilian agency is contracted to stock and
                                manage the main store within the BCE. The contractor
                                owns the stock. Government operated Civil Engineer sup-
                                ply store (GOCESS) is a store stocked and managed as an
                                in-house government function. The stock will be SBSS or
                                local purchased and is owned by the BCE. The Chief of
                                Supply is the final authority for source of supply, but may
                                delegate this authority to the BCE Material Acquisition
                                Element.

                                When the BCE is the sole user, items coded local purchase

                                tions should be obtained through LP. If an item is coded LP
                                and Base Supply stocks the item for users other than BCE,
                                then SBSS should be the source of supply. If the BCE is the
                                only user of an item that Base Supply personnel is currently
                                buying LP, then BCE has three options:
                                (1)    Buy out Base Supply stock.
                                (2)    Draw down supply stocks using fill or kill proce-
                                       dures and non-recurring demands until Base Supply
                                       has a zero balance.
                                (3)    Continue to order the item as a recurring demand
                                       through SBSS. Provisions exist to allow bypassing
                                       of the SBSS if the RDD cannot be met. All items
                                       furnished by SBSS will be loaded in CEMAS with
                                       an SBSS/GSA flag = Y.

                                   (2)    stock class,
                                   (3)    NSN,
                                   (4)    stock number suffix code,
                                   (5)    part number,
                                   (6)    manufacturer, and
                                   (7)    an adequate description of the item.

                                   If this minimal information is missing, either a planner or
                                   shop personnel requesting the item should be contacted to
                                   obtain the necessary information. The stock number suffix
                                   code can be obtained from Base Contracting and is loaded
                                   on all noun records. Base Contracting will not accept requi-
                                   sitions without a valid suffix code. The system will not ac-
                                   cept generic codes, blanks, or zeros in the suffix field.

                                   Screen the Master Cross Reference List (MCRL) part num-
                                   ber to National Stock Number microfiche. Check the
                                   FEDLOG for the given part number. If the part number
                                   cross references to a stock number, check the manufac-
                                   turer’s code and see if it is the same as the company the
                                   requester supplied. The manufacturer's codes can be cross-
                                   referenced to the particular company using the H4 series
                                   microfiche (either manufacturer’s code or manufacturer’s
                                   name sequence, depending on the series). The identification
                                   list (IL) is used to verify the description. If all of these
                                   checks are positive, the Management Data Listing (ML-C)
                                   is used to determine the cost of the item. This provides suf-
                                   ficient information to determine the source of supply (LP or
                                   SBSS). If the part number does not cross to an NSN in the
                                   MCRL, the federal supply class (FSC) can be located by
                                   using the Directory for Supply Cataloging (H-6). Base
                                   Supply and Base Contracting can provide proper training
                                   on research methods.

                                     that appears in the location block. This will complete
                                     the research and make the item ready for processing to

                                CEMAS has an extensive naming convention allowing or-
                                dering by nomenclature (for example, AWG 12, white
                                wire, is input as “wire,” “white,” “AWG12”). The major
                                fields in an item description are:
                                (1)    Noun. This field is used for the most descriptive
                                       word for an item (nail, wire). This field can be up to
                                       ten positions in length but cannot contain spaces.
                                (2)    Synonyms. Synonyms are other names for the same
                                       item (sheetrock or drywall). This field is up to ten
                                       positions in length with up to five synonyms per

                                   Base Supply personnel to update SBSS and BCAS files.
                                   The CEMAS-generated form can be used instead of a man-

4.3.4 Special Fields               The Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) is the minimum or-
                                   der quantity based on vendor requirements (24 per box, 12
                                   per pack, or so much to the roll) and indicates the number
                                   of units usually contained in the standard packing con-
                                   tainer. The reorder quantity is based on multiples of the
                                   MOQ. (If the MOQ is 12 and the reorder program deter-
                                   mines a requirement for 13, the reorder quantity will be
                                   24.) This field also works in conjunction with the “Order
                                   In” unit of issue for local unit of issue assignment within
                                   CEMAS.

                                   The Order In Unit of Issue is used to issue an item in a dif-
                                   ferent quantity than what was ordered. This is helpful with
                                   supply items and LP items [batteries come in boxes (bx)
                                   but it is better to issue them as each]. Items ordered using
                                   the order-in unit of issue will automatically be converted to

Chapter 5           Noun Dictionary Maintenance
5.1   Maintenance               In the following sections, steps are provided to identify and
                                correct discrepancies within the noun, adjective category,
                                adjective, or description files. These procedures will aid in
                                the review and correction of inaccurate and/or misidentified
                                noun item records. Material Acquisition, planners, applica-
                                ble shop, and base contracting personnel should participate
                                in periodic reviews and actions required to correct deficien-
                                cies. Planners must notify Material Acquisition of all dis-
                                crepancies found in the noun file. Material Acquisition per-
                                sonnel research and coordinate the appropriate actions re-
                                quired to correct the discrepancies

5.2   Description Changes       Material Acquisition personnel should coordinate with ei-
                                ther Base Contracting or Base Supply before making
                                changes to items with purchase histories. Material Acquisi-
                                tion personnel are primarily responsible for noun dictionary
                                maintenance because of their role as liaison for the BCE. It
                                is extremely important and necessary they exercise caution
                                to prevent item identity changes when making changes to
                                descriptions. Changes to the noun dictionary are controlled
                                by users who have access rights in the identification file.

5.3   Utility Programs          There are several products that can be found in the utility
                                programs to assist with the file maintenance effort.

                                       (for example, 4730-01-011-0111 and 5210-01-011-
                                       0111). This is a duplicate because the last 11 posi-
                                       tions of a stock number cannot be duplicated in the
                                       SBSS system. Items on this list should be reviewed
                                       and appropriate action taken to delete or correct er-

                                          MLOGUTIL) to recreate necessary records in the
                                          noun dictionary.
                                   (3)    The Invalid/Missing Adjective Listing program,
                                          MISSADJ in MLOGUTIL, generates a listing of all
                                          adjectives deleted from the MADJ file still remain-
                                          ing on existing CSL records in the noun dictionary.
                                          The listing is in alphabetical sequence, by noun, and
                                          lists all adjectives no longer loaded in the category.
                                          The planner and Material Acquisition personnel
                                          should load the adjective under the appropriate
                                          category, code the item for deletion, or change the
                                          adjectives to reflect the correct local conventions.

      Delete                       for delete and new records established. Items coded for de-
                                   lete are not deleted until end-of-session processing. This
                                   allows for production of the consolidated transaction reg-
                                   ister and other program delete functions.

                                   Items coded for delete appear on the monthly deleted noun
                                   status report. This list shows all items coded for delete and
                                   whether or not they were deleted. If the item was not de-
                                   leted, the listing will show the record keeping it from being
                                   deleted. Material Acquisition personnel should clear items
                                   from this listing. Items coded for delete cannot be added to
                                   a new bill-of-material or ordered using line-item requisition

5.5   Adjective                    The MADT and MADJ files are used to add nouns to the
      Category/Adjective           noun dictionary. Categories describe critical aspects of a
                                   noun. If erroneous or duplicate adjectives are loaded in the
      File Cleanup
                                   adjective file, noun records may be added that are dupli-
                                   cates (for example: 14-AWG, #14AWG, AWG-14 are the
                                   same adjective for wire). Review and/or cleanup of the ad-
                                   jectives can be accomplished by using the reports utility to
                                   write a report or develop a list of nouns from the noun dic-
                                   tionary that require review.
                                   (1)    Inquire each noun in the INQ/Up Adjec-
                                          tive/Adjective Categories program on the Logistics
                                          management office menu (program MADJA in
                                          MLOGOBJ). Adjective category and adjective
                                          maintenance can be done in this program.
                                   (2)    Review the adjective categories to ensure they are
                                          compatible with the noun. If they are compatible,
                                          begin review of the adjectives. If they are not com-
                                          patible, make the necessary changes. If the current

                                       all the adjectives listed to represent size and modify
                                       all noun records with colors to sizes.

                                                        CAUTION
                                  1.   Do not change categories without full coordina-
                                       tion.
                                  2.   Consult any planners and shop personnel before
                                       making changes.
                                  3.   Manually update all records currently stored in
                                       BCAS.
                                  4.   Coordinate with Base Contracting.

                                Review the adjectives assigned to the category. The adjec-
                                tives listed should be compatible with the category. If they
                                are, the next category can be reviewed. If they are not com-
                                patible, the adjectives should be deleted or modified. All
                                aspects of a noun and adjective should be considered before
                                it is deleted (for example: wire, category, size, adjectives
                                #14AWG and #14 appear to be duplicates but #14 might be
                                for fence wire). If deletions are required, print the adjective
                                screen and mark all adjectives to be deleted on the listing.
                                Review all noun records with this noun and adjective in the
                                noun dictionary and make necessary changes before delet-
                                ing adjective. The noun and adjective cannot be queried
                                after the adjective is deleted.

                                Noun records should also be reviewed for the adequacy of
                                adjectives. Purge or modify inadequate or erroneous adjec-
                                tives in all noun records by inquiring the noun record with
                                the questionable adjective. If noun records are found with
                                the adjective, either change the adjective or delete it from
                                the noun record. Once all noun records have been cor-
                                rected, make the required changes to the adjective file.

5.6   Validation of Review/     When the corrections are complete, run the Invalid/Missing
      Cleanup                   Adjective Report to ensure all required adjectives are in the
                                adjective file. Print a noun dictionary listing or local report
                                that lists all nouns and adjectives and review all nouns to
                                ensure they have proper adjectives associated with them.
                                This review should be coordinated with the applicable
                                shops, the planner, and Base Contracting.

Chapter 6           Material Acquisition
6.1   Overview                     A planner builds the bill-of-material, establishes an RDD if
                                   funds are available, and tracks to Material Acquisition.
                                   Material Acquisition personnel firm the bill-of-material af-
                                   ter all new items have been researched. CEMAS programs
                                   will survey the residual holding area (residue) and CEMAS
                                   store and supply immediate transfer items when there is
                                   enough inventory to satisfy requirements. If the residue and
                                   store are unable to meet the requirements with the stock on
                                   hand, CEMAS provides requisition documents for the
                                   source of supply shown in the noun dictionary.

                                   A planner or shop personnel is responsible for planning
                                   work and identifying materials needed to perform the re-
                                   quired tasks, ensuring funds are available, assigning an
                                   RDD, and scheduling the work. Material Acquisition per-
                                   sonnel respond to material requests and provide material
                                   support by RDD.

6.2   Work Order Flow              A planner or shop personnel forwards an approved work
                                   request to the responsible person in operations who estab-
                                   lishes a work order folder containing the documentation
                                   required to authorize work. A planner or authorized shop
                                   personnel plans the work using established procedures, de-
                                   termines if funds are available for material purchases, and
                                   enters the RDD in CEMAS.

6.2.1 Assigning an RDD             An RDD is the date the material is required and not a pre-
                                   selected number of days based on the work priority. By es-
                                   tablishing RDDs in the way, Material Acquisition person-
                                   nel can better determine actual priorities for material or-
                                   dering and follow-up criteria. The firm simulation program
                                   provides a recommended RDD based on past delivery time
                                   of items on the bill-of-material. Operation Flight personnel
                                   should review this data when assigning the RDD.

                                   The assignment of the RDD authorizes funds commitment.
                                   Funds are moved into memo committed status and held
                                   based on estimated material cost (calculated by internal or-
                                   dering programs). Notification for Material Acquisition to
                                   order material is done when assigning the RDD. This
                                   places the requirement in the Logistics workload package.
                                   WIMS tracking indicators identify work orders tracked to
                                   Material Acquisition awaiting materials.

                                Material Acquisition personnel perform required research,
6.2.2 Bill-of-material          and firm the bill-of-material. If assets are not available for
      Requisitions              transfer action, CEMAS will generate the appropriate req-
                                uisition documents, as determined by the source of supply.
                                An AF Form 2005, Issue Request (SBSS), a buyer’s ab-
                                stract, or a COCESS abstract will be produced on-line for
                                all items ordered, except those ordered as routine. Routine
                                requisitions are produced during end-of-session processing.
                                The firm summary report and the bill-of-material item list-
                                ing are also created during the firming process.

6.2.3 Monitoring Work           Material Acquisition personnel build and keep a material
      Orders                    documentation folder (MDF).When bills-of-material are
                                firmed, they ensure a copy of the firm status report and
                                item listing is placed in the MDF. Each work order has a
                                material folder that is monitored and in which requisition
                                documents are filed. Minimum documentation require-
                                ments include all store, residue, and holding area issues re-
                                sulting in monetary charges to the work order at the time of
                                close out. The individual who receives the property signs
                                each issue document.

                                       or shop supervisor of the complete status,
                                (2)    ensure all required updates have been completed on
                                       material complete work orders, and
                                (3)    review a copy of the completed bill-of-material to
                                       ensure all required items are on hand and have valid
                                       holding area locations.
                                If the required quantities are not on-hand or locations have
                                not been assigned, Materials Acquisition takes the required
                                action.

                                After completing necessary updates, at least one copy of
                                the bill-of-material is printed and placed in the MDF. This
                                copy of the bill-of-material provides a method for the issue
                                of materials during post-post operations.

                                If the holding area is not located near the work order files, a
                                second copy of the bill-of-material is forwarded to the
                                holding area and a file of material complete work orders is
                                created for the post-post issuing of material. During the
                                creation of this file, procedures are developed to purge it as
                                work orders are closed. A planner or shop personnel will be

                                   WIMS tracing indictors or local reports.

6.2.4 Material Review              Material reviews are performed by a planner or shop per-
                                   sonnel according to AFI 32-1001. The Operations Flight
                                   Chief and the Chief of Material Acquisition document and
                                   coordinate procedures for these reviews. The minimum re-
                                   view should include checks to ensure all items are on-hand
                                   and are adequate in type and quantity to complete the task.

6.2.5 Scheduled Work               When work is scheduled, shop personnel performing the
                                   work will draw the material from the Material Acquisition
                                   holding area. Material Acquisition will process issues for
                                   all materials listed on the work order. When shop personnel
                                   receive the property, they sign the issue document and it is
                                   placed in the appropriate MDF. When all work is com-
                                   pleted and excess material has been turned into Material
                                   Acquisition, shop personnel prepare the work order for
                                   close out and notify Material Acquisition.

                                                               NOTE
                                     A work order cannot be closed out in WIMS until after
                                     the bill-of-material is closed out in CEMAS. This edit
                                     prevents Material Acquisition from having excess
                                     material on hand or on order for closed work orders.


6.2.6 Work Order Closeout          Material Acquisition personnel run the work order close-
                                   out program in CEMAS for all work orders requiring close
                                   out. This program produces either an interim or final close-
                                   out. An interim close-out notice may require action to be
                                   taken (for example, turn-in of material from holding area,
                                   request cancellation of item from supply or Contracting).
                                   Once all actions have been taken, a final close-out report is
                                   produced. The final close-out report shows all items issued,
                                   monetary charges, and total dollar values for each shop.
                                   Material Acquisition personnel will ensure the required
                                   documentation is complete and the person receiving the
                                   property signs the issue document. Upon completion of re-
                                   quired validations, Material Acquisition personnel will
                                   forward the material documentation folders to operations
                                   for final close-out actions.

                                   Operations Flight personnel combine the material docu-
                                   mentation folder and work order folder into one folder
                                   containing all documentation pertaining to the completed
                                   work order. Material documentation is part of the com-

                                tention period in operations. Documents for direct sched-
                                uled work orders should only be retained if capitalization is
                                required.

6.2.7 Pending Material          The Pending Material Ordering file contains records for
      Requisitions              line-item material requirements that have been identified
                                and are awaiting ordering action. Records in this file are
                                maintained by program MPMOUD.

                                The Pending Line-Item Requisitions program was devel-
                                oped for use during end-of-year processing to allow shop
                                personnel, planners, or other personnel to place require-
                                ments in a file for review prior to actual ordering or to in-
                                crease ordering time during end-of-year processing. This
                                program allows the user to pre-identify material require-
                                ments without expending funds. All items identified using
                                this program will be placed in a pending order status re-
                                gardless of the stock conditions. The item may be in resi-
                                due, store, or may have to be ordered; however, it can still
                                be placed in this file as a possible requirement. This file
                                requires someone with requisition rights to actually order
                                the item.

                                The Pending Material Order Screen is displayed for input
                                of data required to identify the item to be requisitioned.
                                Some pertinent data can be modified, such as Urgency Jus-
                                tification code (UJC), Delivery Destination code, Installa-
                                tion code, System Designator, and Force Activity Desig-
                                nator (FAD) code. Extreme care must be used when modi-
                                fying these codes. The Add an Item option allows the user
                                to add items to the pending material order file. Because no
                                funds are committed at this time, no access rights are nec-
                                essary for this option. All fields are edited for valid entries
                                and reject messages are provided to explain any error con-
                                dition.

6.2.8 Line-item Requisitions    Line-item requisitions are for ordering items on non-bill-of-
                                material work orders only. Items required for shop stock,
                                recurring maintenance, direct scheduled work, support of
                                military family housing (MFH), and plant operations are
                                ordered in this manner. Line-item requisitioning is done
                                from the CEMAS logistics menu and will be processed by
                                personnel with Material Acquisition access rights. Funds
                                are moved immediately to committed status and requisi-
                                tions are passed to contracting or supply. A line-item requi-
                                sition that will produce the actual requisition is processed

                                   creates appropriate ordering:

Chapter 7           Inventory Management
                                An inventory identifies and corrects errors in processing
                                and storage operations through reconciliation of item and
                                detail record balances with quantities of stock physically
                                on-hand. Inventory actions provide management with a
                                measurement of the accuracy of accountable records. In-
                                ventory actions should be done expeditiously to prevent
                                backlogs in transaction processing. Personnel assigned in
                                the main store, forward store, and holding and residue areas
                                are given access to the inventory program to request in-
                                ventory on out-of-balance items. Personnel working in the
                                different storage areas are automatically given “inventory
                                request” rights by assignment of their functional area ac-
                                cess codes; i.e., residue, holding, and store.

7.1   Reports and Listings      The Items to be Inventoried Listing reflects items identified
                                during end-of-session processing that require inventory ac-
                                tion. The listing is in bin location sequence and is used to
                                perform the physical count of storage area items. The num-
                                ber of items selected for this listing can be changed in the
                                CEMAS variable file.

                                The Daily Inventory Adjustment Listing reflects all inven-
                                tory adjustments made since the last end-of-session was
                                processed. The individual taking the inventory and a re-
                                viewing official (at least, the Chief of Material Acquisition)
                                sign the listing. All inventory adjustment actions processed
                                for the main store, forward store, holding, and residue areas
                                are shown on this product. PAY CAREFUL ATTENTION
                                to unresolved discrepancies (adjustments that could not be
                                traced to processing errors and point to possible loss of
                                property). These should be considered for further action
                                such as report of survey and investigation by law enforce-
                                ment officials. This listing is an auditable document. The
                                person performing inventory adjustments must:
                                (1)    ensure all adjustments reflect correct information,
                                (2)    ensure action/comment areas adequately justify the
                                       reason for adjustment and subsequent actions taken,
                                       and
                                (3)    sign the listing to verify that all actions are correct.

                                   as the certification official.

                                   The Past Due Inventory Items list reflects all items not in-
                                   ventoried within the last 365 days. The program will freeze
                                   up to 100 items at a time. Items on this listing can be in-
                                   ventoried but not canceled.

7.2   Item Inventory               The main store, holding, residue, and forward stores are
      Selection Process            inventoried on a daily basis with items being randomly se-
                                   lected by end-of-session processing. All items that have not
                                   been inventoried within the last 365 days are also selected
                                   and listed. The 365-day program ensures that all items un-
                                   der the Chief of Material Acquisition control will be in-
                                   ventoried at least once each fiscal year.

                                   Functional personnel will, annually, take an inventory of
                                   the main store, forward store, holding, and residual areas
                                   and identify and resolve discrepancies in these areas.

                                   Assignment and Use of Freeze Codes. Freeze codes are
                                   assigned to an item by end-of-session programs or when an
                                   inventory request is processed. Program control will pre-
                                   vent receipts, issues, and ordering transactions from proc-
                                   essing against items frozen for inventory. Items will remain
                                   frozen until inventory actions are completed. Post-post pro-
                                   cedures are used until inventory actions are completed and
                                   the item is no longer frozen.

                                number of items selected each day can be set in the variable
                                file. For the forward stores, the number of items selected
                                can be set in the Forward Store update information screen.
                                Divide the total number of items in each area by 200 (ap-
                                proximate number of working days in a year) to establish
                                the number of items to be counted each day. This allows
                                the inventory of a few items each day, completing a total
                                inventory annually. The program default randomly selects
                                20 items a day.

                                Request for Inventory Actions should not be made until
                                all efforts have been exhausted to locate the missing mate-
                                rial. The individual requesting the inventory action proc-
                                esses the inventory request to freeze the item record. The
                                “comment” area is used to explain the discrepancy in detail
                                and the research actions completed. Mark the bin showing
                                inventory action is pending and ensure inventory action is
                                carried out expeditiously.

                                Notification of Pending Inventory Actions can be done
                                by entering the inventory program and the areas to be in-
                                ventoried.

                                Daily inventories for main store, residue, holding, and for-
                                ward stores are conducted by selecting items on the inven-
                                tory listing. Because selected items are frozen, daily in-
                                ventory counts should be completed as soon as possible to
                                prevent delays in processing of receipts, orders, and issues.
                                The actual counts are entered on the inventory listing for
                                machine processing later. Individuals without inventory

                                The Chief of Material Acquisition, who is responsible for
                                end-of-session scheduled inventories,
                                (1)    reviews and certifies all inventory results,
                                (2)    investigates unfavorable trends,
                                (3)    ensures inventory actions are expeditiously proc-

                                   The person performing the inventory:
                                   (1)    coordinates with the storage area manager;
                                   (2)    performs inventory in a quick and efficient manner;
                                   (3)    inputs quantities into the inventory program;
                                   (4)    researches, resolves, and adjusts all out-of-balance
                                          conditions; and
                                   (5)    notifies the storage area manager of results when
                                          complete.
                                   Only personnel with inventory adjustment rights may can-
                                   cel items from the inventory schedule. Items canceled will
                                   appear on the List of Items Canceled from Scheduled In-
                                   ventory. The Chief of Material Acquisition manages this
                                   listing to ensure items scheduled are being inventoried. Be-
                                   cause the date of last inventory (DOLI) is not updated for
                                   canceled items, each canceled item will be eligible for in-
                                   ventory beginning with the next end-of-session processing.
                                   To cancel scheduled inventory items:
                                   (1)    enter the Inventory Program;
                                   (2)    enter the Review EOD Items area;
                                   (3)    enter appropriate information (entering a C will
                                          cancel the item from the inventory, delete the freeze
                                          flag, and the DOLI will not be updated); and
                                   (4)    press the appropriate PF key to continue processing.

                                   form adjustments is possible by allowing access to “inven-
                                   tory” in the identification file. The need to perform inven-
                                   tory adjustments may indicate deficiencies in inventory
                                   control, training, lack of security within material storage
                                   areas, failure to follow issue or receiving procedures, theft,
                                   and unprocessed post-post documents. Proper management
                                   practices are required to ensure inventory integrity and ac-
                                   curacy. All material stored by BCE will be inventoried an-
                                   nually as described in subsequent sections.

                                   Inventory adjustment actions are identified during review
                                   of the inventory program. The number of items requiring
                                   inventory action is shown on the right of each area on the
                                   inventory menu. By entering the program and reviewing
                                   the items listed, personnel can review frozen items and as-
                                   sociated problems. There is no automatic adjustment.

                                make inventory adjustments. Personnel taking action to
                                clear frozen item conditions develop an inventory checklist
                                to ensure thorough research actions are performed on each
                                item. Some common causes of shortage and overage con-
                                ditions are unprocessed post-post issues, property newly
                                received but not yet binned, and quantity errors on receipts.

                                Processing Inventory Actions. Inventory personnel will
                                perform thorough and expeditious research for each dis-
                                crepancy to resolve material shortages/overages. After
                                completing the initial count, the count quantities are en-
                                tered in the inventory program.

                                Initial Scheduled Inventory Count Inputs. In Items to be
                                Inventoried, the actual, on-hand count balances are entered
                                into the review end of day (EOD) inventory area of the in-
                                ventory program. Input of the count quantities result in a
                                count quantity equal to computer quantity or county quan-
                                tity not equal to computer quantity. If the inventory count
                                equals the computer quantity, the item is automatically un-
                                frozen and the DOLI is updated in the noun dictionary to
                                today’s date. No further action is required. If the inventory
                                count does not equal the computer quantity, the item is
                                moved from the review EOD area to the review area in the
                                inventory program. This requires further research to re-
                                solve the disparity. Completion of action on these items
                                requires processing an adjustment, even if the computer
                                balance is proven correct. Process an adjustment with the
                                physical quantity equal to the computer quantity to clear
                                the record.

                                Process Inventory Adjustment Actions when the com-
                                puter quantity does not match the physical count. To proc-
                                ess an inventory adjustment:
                                (1)    enter the inventory program and go to the appropri-
                                       ate area (review store, review holding, and other
                                       applicable areas);
                                (2)    locate the item to be adjusted and display it on
                                       screen;
                                (3)    enter the physical count quantity and action taken;
                                       then
                                (4)    press the appropriate PF key to process adjustment.
                                This will delete the freeze code and update the DOLI and

                                   Holding area adjustments result in changes to bill-of-
                                   material costs and require special handling. Justification for
                                   the adjustments is shown in the comment and action areas.
                                   Personnel performing inventory actions and the reviewing
                                   and certification officials are responsible for making sure
                                   adequate explanations and justifications are used. The in-

Chapter 8           Store Operations
                                The main GOCESS store provides assets that are BCE -
                                peculiar, stocked based on past demand history, and may
                                include items identified for emergency standby. Items
                                stocked in the main store are normally high use, expendable
                                type items and may be purchased through SBSS or LP.

8.1   Store Personnel           Store personnel manage materials, reorder, locate received
                                property, issue property to customers, process property
                                transfers to bills-of-material, ensure bins are properly la-
                                beled, identify safety hazards, assign locations, and ensure
                                proper segregation and storage of hazardous and flammable
                                material. They maintain their proficiency in warehousing
                                procedures according to DODR 4145.19-R-1.

                                therefore, stock only fast-moving items. Every quarter,
                                items listed on the Recommended Additions to Store report
                                should be reviewed. Items added to the store are high use,
                                expendable, and should have at least one issue per month to
                                meet automatic reordering criteria. An item without a
                                proven demand rate, is not added to the store until it ap-
                                pears on the quarterly Recommended Additions to Store
                                Stock Listing. Work exceptions on an as required basis.
                                Stocked items that have minimum and maximum levels
                                should be reviewed semi-annually.

                                Store assets should be deleted when they are not used on a
                                continual basis or not meeting the automatic re-ordering
                                criteria. Items appearing on the Recommended Deletions
                                from Store listing should be assigned a minimum level or
                                deleted. To delete an item from store stock: modify the
                                noun maintenance screen by changing the store stocked in-
                                dicator to a N, erase the bin location, and perform the
                                modification of the record. When stock on hand reaches a
                                zero balance, it is an ideal time to delete the item. On-hand
                                stock should be transferred from the shop to another hold-
                                ing area and checked for work order requirements.

                                All stores have an automated bin label generation program.
                                The bin label program is found on the Main Store menu
                                and labels for forward stores are generated using the for-

                                   personnel can locate assets.

8.3   Store Management             The Items Transferred Listing shows items transferred
                                   from the store to bill-of-material through firming actions
                                   and from other areas to the store. Store personnel pull as-
                                   sets from bins and transfer them to the holding area for
                                   storage. They establish suspense systems to ensure trans-
                                   ferred items have been moved to their appropriate storage
                                   location.

                                   The Daily Store Stock Issues List is reviewed by store
                                   personnel to ensure the accuracy of transactions and to ob-
                                   tain the dollar amount of stock being issued from the store.
                                   The daily dollar amount issued is used to set the automatic
                                   store reordering variables.

                                   The Main Store Receipts is a list of items received for
                                   stock and is reviewed by store personnel to ensure all items
                                   received are delivered to the store.

                                   The Line Item Requisition Receipts is a list of items re-
                                   quired for the main store (WO 00011) ordered using line-
                                   item requisition procedures and is used to ensure all items
                                   received are delivered to the store

                                   The Main Store Stock Reorders Report shows items re-
                                   quiring reorder action for the main store, along with the
                                   dollar values required to purchase assets and the actual or-
                                   ders placed. Store personnel manage this report closely,
                                   because the automatic reorders keep stock on-hand to sup-
                                   port future requirements

                                   The Main Store Reorder Program uses many factors to
                                   determine the correct quantities for restockage; allowing
                                   for a normal, 90-day stock turnaround based on quarterly
                                   money constraints. Expending funds at the beginning of the
                                   quarter or period of the FCA to support the store reorder
                                   program should be prudently monitored. Item maximum
                                   levels, minimum levels, minimum order quantity MOQ, re-
                                   order quantity, and re-order point are the factors influenc-
                                   ing the store re-order program, determining the correct
                                   quantities for restockage.

                                A maximum level is used to identify and restrict the
                                maximum quantity of an item desired to be stocked in the
                                store. For instance, if container size precludes stocking
                                large quantities, use a maximum level to override the reor-
                                der quantity. The reorder quantity may be reduced by end-
                                of-session processing to keep the on-hand quantity plus
                                quantity on order less than or equal to the maximum level.

                                The minimum level is used to identify the minimum quan-
                                tity that should be kept in stock at all times. When an issue
                                or transfer results in the on-hand balance being reduced
                                below the minimum level, the item will be ordered during
                                end-of-session processing to bring the on-hand balance
                                back up to the minimum level. This level may be used to
                                override the reorder point.

                                The minimum order quantity is the minimum order
                                quantity based on vendor requirements (for example, 24 per
                                box, 500’ per roll, or 12 per pack) and indicates the number
                                of units normally contained in the standard packing con-
                                tainers. The reorder quantity is based on multiples of the
                                MOQ. If the MOQ is 12 and the reorder program deter-
                                mines a requirement for 13, the reorder quantity will be 24.
                                This field also works with the “order-in” unit of issue for
                                local unit of issue assignment.

                                The reorder quantity is based on an estimated, 90-day us-
                                age and is used by the end-of-session program for auto-
                                matic reorders. It is set manually during the initial upload
                                of the store, but can be updated or changed for the first six
                                months. After six months, it can only be updated under
                                program control. To override it, use the minimum or
                                maximum level fields.

                                The reorder point is the point (on-hand balance) at which
                                the end-of-session reordering program will reorder. This
                                field is manually set during the initial upload of the store.

                                After the first six months, it is updated through program
                                control only. Normally, during the initial upload of the
                                store and when future items are added to the store, the reor-
                                der point is set at 50 percent of the reorder quantity. This
                                field can be overridden through the use of minimum levels.

                                Store reorders are generated automatically by the end-of-
                                session reorder program. If the available balance is less

                                   minimum level, the item will be reordered unless:

                                          of the order,

                                   (7)    the number of past issues does not warrant reorder
                                          or stockage of the item.
                                   The demand criteria is based on at least one issue per
                                   month for all store items. If the number of issues average
                                   less than one per month, the reorder program will not take
                                   order action. If items are zero balance or the on-hand quan-
                                   tity is below the reorder point and the reorder program does
                                   not take action to replenish the item:
                                   (1)    Inquire the noun dictionary.
                                   (2)    Go to the consumption screen.
                                   (3)    Refer to the lower portion of the screen containing
                                          issue and transaction information on store stock
                                          items (month indicator, usage, times issued, pipe-
                                          line days, and times received). The month indicator
                                          and times issued are used to compute demand crite-
                                          ria.
                                   (4)    Determine the number of months an item has been
                                          in the store. Add the month indicator, the second
                                          and third six months, as required.
                                   (5)    Add the times issued from all areas to be used. The
                                          total of these fields is total times issued.
                                   (6)    Divide the total times issued by the total months.
                                          The answer is the average number of issues per
                                          month.

                                                               NOTE
                                     If the average number of issues per month is less than
                                     one and the item should be continued to be re-stocked,
                                     establish a minimum level until consumption increases
                                     to raise the average number of issues above one per
                                     month. If stock levels do not meet the re-order pro-
                                     gram criteria, use line-item requisitioning procedures
                                     to manually re-order.

                                   Control of funding during the automated reorder process is
                                   done with the store reordering variables program on the

                                amount of funds to be expended. Funds are expended from
                                two possible areas: SBSS project fund management rec-
                                ords and local purchase fund cite authorizations (FCAs)
                                (used by contracting).

                                There are two fields available to set spending parameters:
                                the LP amount and the SBSS amount. These fields control
                                the amount of automatic spending in the reorder program
                                and cannot exceed the targets. The reorder program will not
                                exceed the remaining balances based on each target set.
                                This provides the ability to set funds equal to the target and
                                let the reorder program replenish throughout the funding
                                period until funds are depleted. It also allows funds to be
                                turned off and reorder action stopped.

                                To set the amount of funds to be used, pressing the appro-
                                priate PF key updates funding. Enter the amount to be used
                                by the program. This amount may not be greater than the
                                remaining balance shown on the screen for LP information
                                or SBSS information. These amounts, must be closely
                                monitored to ensure store spending is done in a manner that
                                best supports the operation.

      Authorization and         tion of BCE personnel who have been authorized to with-
                                draw material from the store. It is mandatory for individu-
      Issuance of Material      als authorized to withdraw material to possess a valid mili-

                                loaded in the identification file. For self-help and building
                                manager type issues, the identification check is bypassed,
                                but the program requires input of the customers identifica-
                                tion number, name, and building number. When issuing
                                items across the counter to a customer, use the following
                                procedures:
                                (1)    Enter the required data in the store stock issue
                                       frame.

                                       able, issue it; if not, verify the requirement and or-
                                       der it.
                                If the work order or shop code being used is not loaded and
                                the work order is closed, the issue will not process and ap-
                                propriate action must be taken to correct the condition.

                                                               NOTE
                                     The US Armed Services identification card number is
                                     used as the ID NUMBER for military personnel. The
                                     card number from the AF354 (civilian identification
                                     card) is recommended for civilians. The number used
                                     must be unique for each individual. In those cases
                                     where ID card identification numbers have been bar-
                                     coded, it is recommended that the first five letters of
                                     the individual’s last name and the last four digits of
                                     their Social Security account number (SSAN) be used
                                     for the identification number. If the last name is less
                                     than five letters, use spaces for the remaining number
                                     of letters.

                                   If a management notice is received stating a customer’s ID
                                   is invalid, verify the ID number. Materials may not be is-
                                   sued to that person until the ID number has been loaded.

                                   When an individual is issued a new identification card, the
                                   identification file must be updated before material can be
                                   issued

                                   Issues to building custodians, MFH occupants, and person-
                                   nel from other organizations do not require the user to be
                                   loaded in the identification file. Obtain the listing of build-
                                   ing custodians, MFH occupants, commanders, and first ser-
                                   geants from the Real Property Management Office and
                                   keep it current. Use the listing to verify those individuals
                                   who are authorized to draw material from the self-help
                                   store. Validate the customers’ names against their ID card
                                   and input information to the issue screen.

                                   Process items returned to the store using the “Return to
                                   Store” program. If issued from the holding area, return the
                                   item to the holding area to ensure credit is given to the bill-
                                   of-material. If the individual returning the asset cannot
                                   identify the appropriate work order, receive or transfer the
                                   item using the found on base (FOB) program.

                                   Requirements for store stock material contained within a
                                   bill-of-material are programmatically transferred to satisfy
                                   the requirement at the time the bill-of-material is firmed.
                                   The system will automatically transfer on-hand assets
                                   based on the priority criteria of the applicable work order.

                                For Emergency Work Orders (Priority E), if the requested
                                quantity is available in the store, it will be automatically
                                transferred. If the total quantity cannot be filled, it will be
                                requisitioned from the appropriate source of supply. Trans-
                                ferred items will produce a property movement document
                                (PMD), which should be hand-carried to the store for im-
                                mediate action.

                                For Urgent and Routine Work Orders (Priority U/R), the
                                quantity required will be programmatically transferred,
                                providing the requirement does not reduce the available
                                store balance below 50 percent of the on-hand balance. If
                                the requested quantity brings the on-hand balance below
                                the reorder point, the item will be requisitioned during end-
                                of-session processing. When the applicable bill-of-material
                                is firmed and assets are available for transfer to fill the re-
                                quirement, a PMD is produced to transfer the asset to the
                                holding area. These PMDs are forwarded to the store. Ex-
                                pedient processing of PMDs is necessary to prevent errone-
                                ous balances in the store.

8.5   Forward Store             Forward stores are decentralized from the main store and
      Operations                may stock items for self-help or other specialized areas.
                                Items to be stocked within each forward store may be lo-
                                cally determined and may be duplicates of items in the
                                main store. Choosing the correct items in reasonable quan-
                                tities is essential to avoiding unnecessary expenditure of
                                O&M funds. Items, stocked in minimum quantities, can be
                                added to the forward store at the direction of local man-
                                agement and by using the Forward Store menu. Items that
                                are not issued regularly should be returned to the main
                                store, residue, Base Supply, or DRMO.

                                Process forward store issues using the Forward Store pro-
                                grams. Input applicable data and adjust the balance in the
                                forward store. Returned items are processed using the Re-
                                turn to Store program.

                                The forward store re-order program selects items for re-
                                plenishment that are below the order point or minimum
                                level. Those items will display on the screen with the order
                                indicator set at N (NO). To order the item, the indicator
                                must be set to Y (YES) and the appropriate PF key pressed.
                                The program will generate line-item requisition transac-
                                tions for all items marked with a Y as routine requirements
                                with an RDD of the current day plus 30. Those items with a
                                minimum or maximum level will automatically be reor-

                                   quantity of each item on the shelf. The order indicator and
                                   quantity to be ordered can be updated if there is no mini-
                                   mum or maximum level present for the item.

                                   The quantity that will be ordered equals the reorder quan-
                                   tity loaded in the forward store. This amount can be modi-
                                   fied if there is no set minimum or maximum level. If there
                                   is a set minimum or maximum level, the amount ordered
                                   can only be changed in the forward store record.

                                                              NOTE
                                     The program will list all local purchase items, then the
                                     bench stock items. When the bench stock items are
                                     displayed, the program will ask for the shop code to be
                                     used for reordering.


8.6   Bench Stock                  SBSS procedures may be used to provide bench stock sup-
                                   port of stores. CEMAS automates this procedure, making
                                   maintenance actions easier by eliminating the need for a
                                   weekly walk-through by the Base Supply Bench Stock per-
                                   sonnel and eases ordering actions for BCE personnel. The
                                   store reorder program automatically accounts for item bal-
                                   ances and produces a bench stock request form, listing the
                                   organization code, shop code, and the line-items requiring
                                   reorder. Stores should only have one bench stock per store,
                                   for items of high-use and low-dollar value. This reduces the
                                   number of calls to Base Supply Demand Processing Sec-
                                   tion.

                                   Each store should contain one consolidated bench stock and
                                   only one shop code. The main store (work order 00011) is
                                   shop code LG and uses the organization code entered in the
                                   variable file store org code field. Each forward store must
                                   be assigned an organization code different from the main
                                   store. Assign shop code LG (or another specific shop code)
                                   to each forward store bench stock (908/LG = main store,
                                   909/LG = No. 1 forward store). Shop code assignment
                                   should be coordinated with Base Supply according to AFM
                                   23-110.

                                   Bench stock items for the main store are coded in the noun
                                   dictionary as SBSS/GSA Item equal to Y (YES) and have a
                                   bench stock item number and authorized quantity. (These
                                   fields are found on the noun maintenance screen.) The en-
                                   tries in these fields will correspond with the bench stock

                                details already established with Base Supply. This data will
                                provide the necessary information for the store reorder pro-
                                gram to produce required bench stock paperwork for re-
                                plenishment action. These fields are only required if bench
                                stock support is used. The primary shop field should be
                                used to enter the primary user of the item (for example,
                                electrical connectors should be coded as either IT or ET).
                                This allows the ability to write reports to extract all bench
                                stock items by primary user (shop) for semi-annual bench
                                stock reviews.

                                Forward store items are coded in the forward store record.
                                These items will have an organization code and detail
                                number of the Base Supply bench stock. The authorized
                                quantity is entered in the reorder quantity field. The shop
                                code will be assigned to bench stock items when the for-
                                ward store reorder program is run. Bench stock items re-
                                quiring reorder are listed after the local purchase items and
                                require the shop code be used for bench stock reordering.

                                The Store Reorder and Forward Store Reorder programs
                                produce a list of bench stock support items to be reordered.
                                The listing contains the organization code, shop code, and
                                the detail numbers for items to be ordered by the Bench
                                Stock Support Section. AF Forms 2005 or equivalent are
                                used for items requiring reorder.

Chapter 9           Residue
                                   The residue holding area (RHA) is a storage area used for
                                   excess items. Residue items are used as the first source of
                                   supply for all new requirements. Planners should screen
                                   material in the RHA and plan jobs around available excess
                                   whenever possible. Assets available in the RHA will auto-
                                   matically be used to satisfy bills-of-material (BOM) re-
                                   quirements at the time the BOM is firmed. When the trans-
                                   fer takes place, a PMD is produced. When property is
                                   moved to the RHA, the accompanying PMD suspense copy
                                   is used to input the storage location.

                                   The Items Recommended for Deletion from Residue list is
                                   produced during end-of-session processing. Material Ac-
                                   quisition personnel review the list to determine if items
                                   with no usage should be kept in the residual holding ac-
                                   count (WO 00012). The RHA supervisor will coordinate
                                   with the Chief of Material Acquisition, shop superinten-
                                   dent, and Planning personnel before turning excess material
                                   into DRMO. Material in residue should be reviewed at least
                                   annually to determine if retention beyond 365 days is
                                   worthwhile. Obtain written justification from the
                                   BCE/designated representative to retain residue beyond 365
                                   days.

Chapter 10 Receiving Procedures
                                Receipts come from three primary sources: (1) Base Sup-
                                ply, (2) COCESS, and (3) local vendors, including Interna-
                                tional Merchant Purchase Authorization Card (IMPAC).
                                Processing receipts generate PMDs to the store and holding
                                area. Material safety data sheets should accompany all re-
                                ceipts for hazardous material.

10.1 Procedures                 SBSS property is delivered to the receiving area or other
                                site designated by Material Acquisition personnel. Upon
                                receipt, receiving personnel check the delivery for accuracy
                                and damage. If there is an error or damage, the delivery can
                                be refused using organization refusal procedures. Base sup-
                                ply items may be received by document number, CSL
                                number, or national stock number. Processing the receipts
                                will update the work order information and produce an ap-
                                plicable PMD.

                                COCESS contractor bases receive property according to
                                local directives and contracts. COCESS sales tickets ac-
                                company property and are annotated with the document
                                numbers assigned to each item request. If document num-
                                bers are not annotated on the sales tickets, a combination of
                                CSLs or work orders can be used to identify the items. Re-
                                ceiving personnel verify the accuracy of the item and
                                quantity delivered before signing documents or processing
                                receipts.

                                Local purchase/vendor receipts should be accompanied by
                                a vendor ticket. If the items were purchased by Base Con-
                                tracting, the ticket will contain a procurement item identi-
                                fication number (PIIN), and may have a supplemental PIIN
                                (S-PIIN/call number). Items delivered must be validated,
                                matching item description and quantity. PIIN/S-PIIN, CSL,
                                and document number are input into the system.

                                                           NOTE
                                  Vendor receiving procedures must be coordinated with
                                  Base Contracting and Accounting and Finance to en-
                                  sure all aspects of LP receiving are adequately cov-
                                  ered.

                                   Items returned from specific work orders (internal BCE re-
                                   ceiving) are processed using the return to holding program.
                                   A PMD is produced, identifying where the item can be
                                   stored and other data reflecting the work order and item.
                                   Items returned in this manner will adjust the work order
                                   costs. If work order information is not available, transfer or
                                   found on base procedures are used. Shop and/or Material
                                   Acquisition personnel research the correct work order to
                                   which the item was originally charged.

                                   Shop and operation requirements use line-item receipts as
                                   stated on the PMD. These items are held in an awaiting
                                   shop pick up area until shop personnel sign a copy of the
                                   PMDs. Items received for bills-of-material (vendor to
                                   holding) are forwarded to the holding area for storage until
                                   issued to the craftsperson.

10.2 Receipts Not Found            Research is required during receipt processing when docu-
                                   ment numbers are not loaded. This could be caused by
                                   wrong document numbers on receipt documentation or
                                   canceling work orders after the shipment of materials. If
                                   possible, receive the item using the stock number or CSL
                                   number matching the work order and quantity. The work
                                   order, stock, or CSL numbers in the purchase order file can
                                   be queried to identify the item. If it is an SBSS item, but
                                   found with a different document number, the document
                                   number is updated in the purchase order file and the item is
                                   received. Document numbers for LP items cannot be modi-
                                   fied. These items are received using the existing document
                                   number and manual annotations are made to explain the
                                   problem.

10.3 Reverse-post                  Reverse-post (RVP) receipt transactions when it is neces-
                                   sary to restore records to their original condition. The
                                   transaction register is used to perform the required research
                                   to initiate the RVP action. Material Acquisition personnel
                                   determine if the transaction is reversible and which trans-
                                   actions to reverse. The RVP program allows a reverse-post
                                   by document number, CSL number, NSN, or PIIN/S-PIIN.
                                   The number of reversed transactions posted is dependent
                                   upon the number of transactions associated with the error.

Chapter 11 Material Storage And Distribution
11.1 Holding Area               The holding area is a staging area where materials for work
     Documentation              orders are kept until all items required on the BOM have
                                been received. PMDs are produced and materials sent to the
                                holding area as a result of vendor receipts, firming of
                                BOMs, and returns of material issued from holding. PMDs
                                will identify the work order to which the property belongs.

11.2 Bills-of-material          Materials remaining in the holding area after the close-out
     Documentation              of a bill-of-material are properly disposed or transferred to
                                ensure accurate material costing. Identification of materials
                                awaiting disposition is done when the work order is ready
                                to be closed. Material Acquisition personnel perform close-
                                out by using the work order close-out program.

                                An interim close-out report is produced to identify items
                                on-hand or on-order. Material identified on the report will
                                be disposed or canceled before the final close-out of the
                                bill-of-material. Material can be canceled from the bill-of-
                                material and kept on-order in the purchase order file.
                                Holding area personnel may use the transfer program to
                                transfer the items to appropriate areas. PMDs are produced
                                for each asset. Holding area personnel locate the property,
                                attach the PMD to the asset, and forward it to the store or
                                residue receiving area. Upon completion of all transfer ac-
                                tion, holding area personnel annotate the interim close-out
                                as action completed and return it to Material Acquisition
                                for final close-out.

                                Inquire the Review of Excess Bills-of-Material program by
                                CSL to identify all bills-of-material with identical require-
                                ments. The complete bill-of-material file is queried and all
                                work orders (WO) with the same material on-hand or on-
                                order are displayed. The display shows the work order, pri-
                                ority, firm status, unit of issue, quantity required, quantity
                                due in, quantity on-hand, and holding area location.

                                The Transfer program allows the transfer of items from
                                work orders to WO. It requires entries in the CSL, quantity,
                                from and to WO, from and to document number, and from
                                and to shop code. The bill-of-material is checked for a valid
                                item for both the from and to WO. If the "to" bill-of-
                                material is coded as ORDER = N, a document number is
                                not required in the "to" document number. If the item being

                                   cess field. This allows the program to complete the transfer
                                   and not accept the item on the old work order when the
                                   item is delivered. If the item being transferred is not excess
                                   (required in the old WO), an “N” is entered in the excess
                                   field. Entering an “N” writes a transfer record for future
                                   use; the program will automatically return the material
                                   when it is received to the work order from which it was
                                   transferred.

                                   Property forwarded to the residue area have a PMD at-
                                   tached showing quantity and description. The type of action
                                   generating the PMD is identified in the from portion of the
                                   PMD. Transfers to the residue holding area result from
                                   work order close-outs, found on base items, store stock
                                   transfers, and excess receipts.

                                   All CEMAS documentation relating to a work order with a
                                   bill-of-material has a corresponding documentation folder
                                   containing all related PMDs. PMD's are annotated with the
                                   filing instructions on the lower half of the document. Other
                                   documentation filed in the folder is to be determined lo-
                                   cally; however, filing procedures for the PMDs must meet
                                   audit requirements. Control documents should be validated
                                   and filed daily.

Chapter 12 Post-post Procedures
12.1 Procedures                 Post-post procedures are required when the computer is
                                non-operational for a period of time. If the system is ex-
                                pected to be down for a period of five workdays or more,
                                an alternate site should be considered for processing
                                CEMAS and end-of-session transactions.

12.2 Responsibilities and       It is the responsibility of the Chief of Material Acquisition
     Actions                    to:
                                (1)    Ensure all sections are notified of post-post condi-
                                       tions.
                                (2)    Ensure existing store transfers are collected and the
                                       property is moved from store bins before beginning
                                       post-post issues from the store. If time or volume
                                       does not allow movement of property, place the ap-
                                       plicable transfer documents in the appropriate bins
                                       to serve as indicators that property is already allo-
                                       cated to other work orders. Any balance above the
                                       quantity required to satisfy the transfer can be is-
                                       sued during the post-post operation.
                                (3)    Ensure post-post documents are collected for all
                                       issue and receiving actions.
                                (4)    Designate an area for post-post processing and as-
                                       sign personnel as required to assist with the opera-
                                       tion.
                                (5)    Designate personnel and terminals for post-post re-
                                       covery operations to ensure a smooth transition to
                                       on-line operations.
                                (6)    Assign access codes as required for personnel to
                                       assist post-post recovery in designated areas.
                                (7)    Ensure the inventory clerk processes all inventory
                                       discrepancies identified during post-post recovery
                                       in a timely manner.
                                (8)    Ensure store post-post issues are processed before
                                       allowing on-line store issues. Do not allow firming
                                       of bills-of-material until all post-post recovery ac-
                                       tions are completed. This will prevent warehouse
                                       refusals due to issues caused by erroneous on-hand
                                       balances (balances that have not been reduced by
                                       post-post issues).
                                (9)    Ensure corrective actions and reprocessing of post-
                                       post documents are taken as soon as possible after
                                       inventory action is completed.

12.2.1 Main Store                  Once post-post procedures are implemented, all sections
                                   will forward all store to bill-of-material documents to the
                                   store. Store personnel will pull items before issuing prop-
                                   erty post-post. If time or volume does not permit them to
                                   physically pull material from the bin, they will place the
                                   appropriate transfer documents in the bin to indicate a por-
                                   tion or all of the on-hand assets are not available for issue
                                   but are obligated to other work orders. They will make sure
                                   there is enough property on-hand to support existing trans-
                                   fer documents.

12.2.2 Insufficient Balance        During post-post recovery processing, if Material Acquisi-
                                   tion personnel identify an insufficient balance, they should
                                   carefully check for the missing quantity (primarily receiv-
                                   ing). If the shortage is not found, an inventory request to
                                   notify the inventory clerk to take appropriate action is
                                   processed. All unprocessed documents should be retained
                                   for the CSL number, so corrective action can be taken upon
                                   completion of inventory action.

12.2.3 Forward Store               When the system is not operational and issues need to be
                                   made, forward store personnel should establish a file col-
                                   lection area for all post-post issue documents. Forward
                                   store post-post issues should be limited to emergency and
                                   urgent requirements. Upon notification the system is op-
                                   erational, all post-post issues are processed before proc-
                                   essing on-line issue transactions. Post-post is not complete
                                   until all documents have been processed.

12.2.4 Receiving                   Receiving personnel should establish a temporary location
                                   for property until the system comes back on-line. Annotate
                                   this location on the receipt document for future reference
                                   until normal, on-line receipt processing continues. After
                                   processing the receipts, applicable PMDs are produced to
                                   indicate the disposition of the property.

12.2.5 Recovery                    During post-post recovery, all <NEW ITEM> loads to the
                                   CSL file can be done at any time. Material Acquisition per-
                                   sonnel should use the following steps for an efficient and
                                   accurate recovery:

                                   Step 1

                                   Clear requests for quote (RFQs) and Awards and Process
                                   Store Receipts: All RFQs received during post-post should
                                   be awarded. While the buyers are clearing the awards for

                                                                                 Chapter 12

                                the RFQs, receiving personnel should process all receipts
                                that were awarded before post-post. These items are ones
                                that have an award notice, AF Form 1155, Order for Sup-
                                plies or Services, on file.

                                Step 2

                                Add Items to Bills-of-Material, Make Awards, and Process
                                Store Receipts and Issues. Material Acquisition personnel
                                should load all items ordered during post-post. Once
                                loaded, the buyers then make the awards. Finally, the re-
                                ceiving personnel process the receipts and issue the items if
                                applicable.

                                Step 3

                                Process All Other Receipts and Turn-ins (TINs) to the
                                Store. After all awards have been processed, store person-
                                nel should process all other receipts and TINs.

                                Step 4

                                Store Issues and TINs to Residue. After all receipts have
                                been completed, Material Acquisition personnel should
                                process all store (including forward store), issues, issues to
                                the holding area, issues from residue, issues to DRMO, and
                                TINs to residue.

                                Step 5

13.1 SBSS Products                 Proper management of Material Acquisition requires in-
                                   formation to assist with good decision-making. Base Sup-
                                   ply provides many products to ensure information is avail-
                                   able to manage the Material Acquisition function effec-
                                   tively.

                                   The Daily Document Register (D04), used by Material
                                   Acquisition and Financial Management, lists individual
                                   material transactions by document number, shop code, ac-
                                   tivity code, and serial number within the BCE organization.
                                   It is a resource to monitor supply transactions, for transac-
                                   tion verification, and to ensure all CEMAS SBSS require-
                                   ments were processed into the SBSS.

                                   The BCE Dueout Status Listing (D03/M09) is used by
                                   Material Acquisition personnel to monitor and analyze
                                   dueouts for assigned work orders, and for requisitioning
                                   and follow-up actions. Using the D03, Material Acquisition
                                   personnel review urgency of need (UND) A items on a
                                   daily basis, and UND B items at least weekly. Using the
                                   M09, they validate all dueouts (UND A, B, and C) at least
                                   monthly. Special programs within CEMAS allow update of
                                   status information from the M09 produced by Base Supply.
                                   Material Acquisition personnel should use this option
                                   weekly to update status on all dueouts (see CEMAS/SBSS
                                   M09 processing in AFMAN 23-110, volume II, part two,
                                   chapter 31).

                                   The BCE Transactions (D10) is an SBSS end-of-session
                                   program providing daily interface transactions which up-
                                   date CEMAS. In order to ensure all material transactions
                                   records produced by Base Supply are input to CEMAS, a
                                   transaction summary record (CW*) will be processed as
                                   part of each D10 file. The control information (SRAN and
                                   sequence number) in the summary record is compared with
                                   the data in the individual CWM records to ensure that they
                                   all correspond. The total number of records and the dollar
                                   value reflected in the CW* record is compared with the
                                   actual cost work order materials (CWM) records processed.
                                   Management notices are printed on the “BCE Material
                                   Transaction List” (PCN SF022-466) to indicate if the data
                                   compared was equal or if problems exist.

                                                           NOTE
                                  Transactions rejecting from SBSS data files will ap-
                                  pear as management notices on this list. The error cre-
                                  ating the reject must be resolved and the reject cleared
                                  as soon as possible to ensure cost information is cor-
                                  rectly recorded in CEMAS.

                                As these files are processed in CEMAS, the CW* record is
                                stored in the MD10SEQ file and retained for information
                                purposes. The D10 sequence number should start with 001
                                for the first file produced during the month of October. If a
                                sequence number greater than 50 is processed, the program
                                will consider this to be a past FY file and the file will not
                                be processed. Therefore, it is very important that all current
                                FY files be processed prior to processing the CEMAS end-
                                of-year. This program is the primary interface for the SBSS
                                D10 transactions and the BCE cost accounting system.

                                The Due-In From Maintenance Listing (DIFM) (D23) is
                                a required listing produced for each organization. It shows
                                a current inventory of DIFM assets and provides a recon-
                                ciliation of DIFM status in the organization. BCE Material
                                Acquisition personnel use this listing to monitor balances
                                of BCE DIFM issues and turn-ins.

13.2 CEMAS Products             The List of Delinquent Purchase Orders lists items that
                                are past due based on their priority and agreed delivery date
                                (the list is not cumulative). Material Acquisition personnel
                                should review this listing to ensure adequate follow-up
                                support.

                                The Items from Bills-of-Material with Priority E and
                                Probable Locations lists all priority E items on order that
                                have a balance on-hand in residue and holding areas, main
                                stores, forward stores, or shop stocks. It also shows how
                                many other items are on order for the work order. This list
                                assists in locating material for emergency work orders that
                                has been turned-in since being ordered. Material Acquisi-

                                   this product to validate receipt of BCAS transactions for
                                   appropriate CEMAS transmittals.

                                   The CEMAS/BCAS Transmittal Listing contains all
                                   transactions sent to BCAS since the last end-of-session
                                   processing. It is broken out by type transaction and used
                                   with the CIAPS/BCAS Transaction listing to monitor the
                                   CEMAS/BCAS interface.

                                   The Contracting Administrative Lead-time (CALT) Re-
                                   port summarizes all purchase actions made by buyers
                                   (Base Contracting or BCE). It identifies actions by buyers’
                                   ID, by priority, and shows the time taken to process pur-
                                   chase actions. The CALT is measured from the time the
                                   abstract is produced, or transaction processed to BCAS, to
                                   the time the award is made in the purchase order file. Mate-
                                   rial Acquisition personnel can check this by comparing the
                                   date ordered (Julian date in the document number) and the
                                   date awarded on the purchase order screen. They should
                                   use this product to show contracting and purchasing sup-
                                   port received. The average number of days from request to
                                   award is contained in the summary at the bottom of the
                                   page. This information is used to identify deficiencies in
                                   contracting support.

                                   order, and expected due-in dollar values. The summary is
                                   in two parts:

                                   Part One. Complete Work Orders. This part summarizes all
                                   work orders in the holding area that are material complete
                                   by priority, number of days complete, and dollar value.

                                   Part Two. Incomplete Work Orders. This part displays the
                                   same information as the completed portion except for in-
                                   complete bills-of-material.

                                   The Recovery Error Listing is produced after running the

                                The Recovery Statistics Listing is a statistical report
                                showing the number and type of transactions used in the

13.3 Inquiries                  The Firm Simulation Program shows what would happen
                                if a particular bill-of-material is firmed. It shows which
                                items, if any, would transfer from either the store or resi-
                                due, which items would be ordered and the source of sup-
                                ply (SBSS or LP), and the cost information. It also provides
                                a recommended RDD based on past delivery times for all
                                items on the bill-of-material. This date appears in the his-
                                torical delivery time field. This program is especially help-

Chapter 14 Report Writing
14.1 Report Writing             The report writing utility allows access to data files to ex-
     Utility                    tract information in the format desired. It takes time to
                                learn the techniques and requires some practice to become
                                proficient at report writing. The report utility is accessed
                                through the “RUN PROGRAM” option. If the RUN
                                PROGRAM option is not on the menu or if there are any
                                problems, the system administrator should be contacted.
                                The report utility is a data retrieval system used, as needed,
                                to extract required information. It is an effective manage-
                                ment tool which provides the user with unlimited informa-
                                tion.

                                The first screen in the report utility is the entry screen
                                shown below. Select (2) to begin writing a report.

                                tion (name) is the name elected to call this report and can
                                be up to eight characters. Usually, the additional data file or
                                user exit program will be left as NO, but can be used at a
                                later date after mastering the art of report writing. After
                                entering the name of the report, press Enter. The system
                                administrator will provide the convention for naming re-
                                ports.

                                The next screen asks for the primary data file name, library,
                                and volume. Type in the information required. If retrieving
                                information that is located in the noun file, type the primary
                                file as MNON in library MLOGDATA. The system ad-
                                ministrator can assist with library and volume names.

                                Press the "Enter" key to continue.

                                The control file shows the positions in which each field
                                starts and the length of the field. This aids the report gen-
                                erator in finding requested information. Once the primary
                                data file is identified, press enter and a screen will immedi-

                                   pleted. Read it carefully. It is asking for the control file in-
                                   formation. It will be blinking because the ID needs to be
                                   changed to MLOG in the library area. For a report on the
                                   noun file, use file name MNON, library MLOGCTL, and
                                   volume PGM001. This screen flashes as if something is
                                   wrong. Don’t try and repeat the previous step to input the
                                   primary data file information or the report will abort.

                                   Press the "Enter" key to continue.

                                   Place an “X” next to the fields required to provide infor-
                                   mation for the report. Select all fields to be displayed on the
                                   report or for any which are to be sorted or selected.

                                   Once all fields are selected, press the "Enter" key to con-
                                   tinue.

                                   The next screen will ask to define any new fields. Usually,
                                   this option is not used. It is an advanced option and should
                                   be covered with the system administrator.

                                   Press the "Enter" key to continue.

                                   The menu of all report definition options is on the next
                                   screen. Press enter to go through each of the options in or-
                                   der.

                                   The report title screen contains report title information. It
                                   will automatically provide the title identified on the entry
                                   screen of the report. A more descriptive title helps person-
                                   nel viewing the report to know what data is in the report
                                   and how it is sorted. Enter title.

                                   Press the "Enter" key to continue.

                                   The purpose of the column heading option is to change the
                                   names of the field headings. These headings appear above
                                   the data for each item. Headings default to the data name
                                   contained in the control file. These should be more de-
                                   scriptive. Update the headings.

                                   Press the "Enter" key to continue.

                                next. Usually, two spaces are left between fields. Make any
                                necessary changes.

                                Press the "Enter" key to continue.

                                The Field Sequence screen is important because it will de-

                                There are three rows that can be used for the information.
                                The first position represents the row for the data and the
                                second number is the sequence it will appear on that row.
                                Fields with 99 as the sequence number will not be dis-
                                played or printed on the report; however, they can be used

                                The External field size is the number of spaces taken by
                                data in the field shown; it can be changed. Usually, the
                                field size is not changed because all positions of the data
                                should be viewed.

                                Press the "Enter" key to continue.

                                The next screen is called the Output Data Edit Options.
                                Data edit options are used to reposition the decimal within
                                numerical fields; suppress (hide) leading zeros in numeric
                                fields, such as costs; and put dollar signs and commas into
                                costs. If help is needed on this screen, press PF14 for an
                                explanation of options. Make updates.

                                Data Limits tell the program how to limit the information to
                                specific needs. For instance, noun records equal (=) to paint
                                could be selected using this screen. If data is entered, addi-
                                tional data limit screens will be displayed. This allows for a
                                narrower scope of search criteria. If the data fields are left
                                blank, the screen will release to the next stop of report defi-

                                data files for CEMAS are located in the MLOGDATA li-
                                brary and on the DAT001 or WPD001 volume. Control
                                files are located in the MLOGCTL library and the PGM001
                                volume.

Chapter 15 Material Acquisition
15.1 Resource                      The ability to distribute and track funds at the cost center
     Management                    level is accomplished by using a series of records and data
                                   elements. The Project Funds Management Record (PFMR)
                                   and Fund Cite Authorization (FCA) are the primary tools
                                   used to distribute and track funds within Material Acquisi-
                                   tion. Both records are maintained in CEMAS. With a few
                                   exceptions, the PFMR is used for funds spent in Base Sup-
                                   ply and the FCA is used for funds spent for local purchase
                                   through contracting.

                                   The use of the organization code tells CEMAS which
                                   PFMR or FCA to debit. The flexibility to designate funds is
                                   possible by using multiple records. For example, three or-
                                   ganization codes may be established: 1 – work orders, 2 –
                                   CEMAS Main Store, and 3 – shop operating supplies. With
                                   proper use of organization codes, funds can be tracked, not
                                   only to a specific cost center, but also to specific work or-
                                   ders. The shop code is used to designate the craft within
                                   BCE.

                                                             NOTE
                                     The PFMR record maintained in CEMAS will not
                                     agree with the PFMR record maintained in Base Sup-
                                     ply because base service store items and individual
                                     equipment are not recorded in CEMAS. Daily, or at
                                     least weekly, Material Acquisition personnel or the
                                     Funds Manager, as determined locally, will update the
                                     PFMR costs in CEMAS to align CEMAS with the ac-
                                     tual Base Supply PFMR dollars.


15.2 CEMAS Funds                   The first step in establishing funds in the CEMAS system is
                                   the establishment of the organization codes. This requires
                                   the use of previously established organization codes that
                                   have been added in the Base Supply System or new organi-
                                   zation codes that will be added. Base Supply will approve
                                   or disapprove all new organization codes and add them to
                                   the SBSS before use in CEMAS.

                                   Adding an organization code to the CEMAS system re-
                                   quires:
                                   (1)    a responsibility cost center code (RCCC),

                                (2)    a PFMR,
                                (3)    a fund area code,
                                (4)    a unique number used to allow multiple FCAs for
                                       the same RC and fund code combination, and
                                (5)    an organization title
                                The organization title should be very descriptive. This title
                                is displayed to users creating the bills-of-material to assist
                                them in correctly selecting the organization code. The
                                RCCC and fund area are necessary to establish an FCA re-
                                cord. Once a unique combination of RCCC and fund area is
                                established on the organization record, an FCA can be es-
                                tablished. All organization records with matching RCCC
                                and fund area information are attached to the FCA.

15.2.1 Establishing an FCA      Establishing an FCA requires:
                                (1)    a unique FCA number from the AF Form 9 or 616,
                                (2)    a fund code,
                                (3)    an expiration date (the date the FCA will expire),
                                (4)    a fund citation (from either AF Form 9 or 616),
                                (5)    a brief description, and
                                (6)    a target.
                                The target in the organization record provides a way to
                                control or allocate funds required to support that specific
                                requirement. The total dollar amount loaded for all organi-
                                zation record targets cannot exceed the amount loaded in
                                the CEMAS FCA. The reserved funds and reserve trans-
                                portation amounts are two additional fields on the FCA
                                screen that should be used if applicable.

15.2.2 CEMAS Financial          The following is a brief description of how cost flows
       Management               through CEMAS (see Figure 1, Funds Management Process
                                in CEMAS):
                                (1)    There is no impact of funds until Operations Flight
                                       personnel assign the RDD to the bill-of-material
                                       and forwards the package to Material Acquisition.
                                       The funds required to support the bill-of-material
                                       are placed in a memo committed status.
                                (2)    This memo amount is immediately subtracted from
                                       the FCA balance. The money is set aside to cover
                                       the expense of the bill-of-material. When Material
                                       Acquisition personnel firm up (order) the require-
                                       ment and forward it to Contracting, the funds are
                                       moved from memo to committed status. The dollar
                                       amount that is moved into committed is based on


Volume 4 Material Acquisition                                                              61

                                           current price and the current source of supply listed
                                           in the CEMAS noun file.
                                   (3)     Once Contracting personnel make an award on the
                                           requirement, the dollar amount is moved from
                                           committed to obligated stage. The amount moved
                                           into obligated is the actual amount of the award and
                                           could differ from the committed amount.
                                   For bases operating in the COCESS environment, the dollar
                                   amount to support the bill-of-material remains in the com-
                                   mitted stage until property is received. When receipt of
                                   property is final, the system will subtract the dollar amount
                                   from committed and add the actual price paid, plus any ad-
                                   ditional charges, to obligated (Figure 2, Funds Management
                                   Process in COCESS).

15.3 CEMAS/FCA                    CEMAS features automatic actions and funding expendi-
     Responsibility               tures for tracking capabilities. The primary sources of these
                                  abilities are the SBSS PFMR and the FCA maintained for
                                  local purchase (LP) prepared by the Base Contracting Of-

                                  track FCA dollar amounts used. To set up an FCA:
                                  (1)    BCE personnel coordinate with required offices to
                                         obtain an FCA for buying CEMAS LP items.
                                  (2)    BCE Material Acquisition personnel make sure ap-

Chapter 16 Base Variable File
16.1 Base-unique Data           The base variable file allows users to set up base-unique
                                information and data elements. Programs use the base vari-
                                able file throughout the system.

16.2 Base Variables             Base variables that can be updated are as follows.

                                Control Center. A one-position code used to identify the
                                control center the system is supporting. The code is nor-
                                mally an “A.” Some installations use “B” as the predomi-
                                nant control center and some may use several control cen-
                                ters. For multiple control centers, the predominate code
                                should be used.

                                Store Stock Org Code. This three-position organization
                                code is used for controlling funds used for main store op-
                                erations support and is assigned to the FCA and PFMR
                                supporting the main store.

                                Store Stock Variables. This screen displays both the local
                                purchase and Base Supply funding information for the store
                                organization code contained in the base variable file.

                                Local Purchase Information. The organization code for
                                the store is displayed with the target, obligated committed,
                                and memo committed actual figures. The balance repre-
                                sents the dollar amount available for store stock reorder
                                use. If the estimated FCA balance is less than that which is
                                available on the organization code, the amount to be used is
                                the lesser of the estimated FCA balance or the user input
                                amount of funds to be used for LP. If the amount to be used
                                is left as zero ($000), the reordering program will not reor-
                                der local purchase items.

                                SBSS Information. The total dollar amount available on
                                the PFMR associated with the store organization code is
                                displayed. The user may set the amount of funds to be used
                                for Base Supply reordering. The end-of-session reordering
                                program uses whichever is less: the user input dollar
                                amount or the CEMAS balance. This prevents spending
                                more money than is available. If the amount of funds is left
                                at zero ($000), the reordering program will not order any
                                Base Supply store stock.

                                   SBSS Document Serial Number Block. The SBSS docu-
                                   ment serial number block represents the first number of a
                                   reserved block of document numbers.

                                   Purchase Order Document Number. This is a number
                                   assigned to identify the BCE stock record account number
                                   (SRAN) at each base. The four-digit SRAN assigned to the
                                   local base supply FB/FE account also applies to the FC ac-
                                   count, i.e. FC4800. New stock record account numbers are
                                   requested through MAJCOM from HQ AFMC/LGSW.

                                   LP Document Serial Number Block. The LP document
                                   number block is used to assign document numbers to all
                                   transactions other than SBSS requirements. The block
                                   should not duplicate the block used for SBSS numbers.

                                   CEMAS Element of Expense/Investment Cost (EEIC).
                                   This represents the EEIC assigned by or coordinated
                                   through Accounting and Finance. It is used in the produc-
                                   tion of financial management transactions and should be an
                                   EEIC in the 619XX area. EEIC 61930 must be used at
                                   COCESS bases. This code is changed by a conversion pro-
                                   gram at the end of each month to 61910 for Accounting and
                                   Finance transactions.

                                   RFQ Constant. This eight-position field consists of the
                                   six-position contracting activity number (PIIN) and the
                                   two-position year. COCESS should be entered at bases op-
                                   erating under a COCESS contract.

                                   Delivery Destination. This three-position code identifies
                                   the delivery location for material. It is displayed on the
                                   system-produced AF Form 2005 and is a part of the FOB
                                   destination on mail-out requests for quotes.

                                   Delivery Location. This field is used to identify the loca-
                                   tion where materials are to be delivered and is displayed as
                                   a part of the FOB destination on mail-out requests for
                                   quotes and in the SHIP TO block on CEMAS-produced DD
                                   Forms 1155.

                                   Automatic Store Transfer. This field determines whether
                                   automatic transfers will occur during the firm and modifi-
                                   cation processes for items associated with bills-of-material.
                                   If the field contains a “Y,” automatic transfers from the
                                   store to work orders will occur for emergency work orders
                                   (all store stock may be transferred if needed) and for urgent

                                and routine work orders (up to 50 percent of store stock). If
                                there is an “N,” no automatic transfers from the store will
                                occur; transfers must be done manually.

                                Number of Items to Inventory. This field allows selection
                                of the number of items in the main store, residue, and
                                holding area to be selected for inventory on a daily basis.

                                BCAS Interface Activation. This switch turns the
                                CEMAS/BCAS interface on or off. A direct input key
                                (DIRK) number obtained from HQ AFCESA/CEO, 139
                                Barnes Drive, Tyndall AFB (DSN 523-6370) or
                                SSG/SBEEM, 201 East Monroe Drive, Maxwell AFB
                                Gunter Annex (DSN 596-2409) is required.

                                Contracting to Support Multiple CEMAS. This switch
                                allows the Contracting office to interface with more than
                                one CEMAS operation.

                                RDD Buy Flag. This flag is used in processing demands to
                                base contracting. If a “Y” is placed in this field, all requisi-
                                tions are sent to contracting as priority 9 requisitions and
                                are sorted and purchased by RDD. If the flag is “N,” de-
                                mand will be sent to contracting with priority 3 for emer-
                                gency demands, 8 for urgent, and 13 for routine.

                                COCESS Flag. This flag will be set to “Y” if all bench
                                stock-type items will be obtained only from the COCESS
                                contractor.

                                GOCESS Flag. This flag will be set to “Y” if operation is
                                a GOCESS operation with partial COCESS (contractor
                                who provides only BPA items) or no COCESS contractor.
                                SBSS bases should also set this switch to “Y.”

                                Partial COCESS Flag. This flag will be set to “Y” (with
                                assistance from HQ AFCESA/CEO or SSG/SBEEM) if
                                using three sources of supply (SBSS, LP, and GOCESS).

                                SF44/Card Buy Flag. Setting this flag to “Y” allows BCE
                                to purchase items locally and prevents passing requisitions
                                to BCAS for items bought with SF44 or credit card. The
                                abstract will print in BCE Material Acquisition.

                                BPA Buy Flag. This flag should be turned on if Base Con-
                                tracting has authorized purchase of all BCE BPA items lo-
                                cally.

                                   Printer Assignment. It is necessary to identify the printer
                                   class to be used by the various CEMAS users. This infor-
                                   mation is used during on-line CEMAS processing to route
                                   products to CEMAS areas other than the area producing the
                                   product.

                                   COCESS Variable Data. COCESS variable data is used to
                                   automate QAE functions and provide funds for emergency
                                   charges. These variables are important for the correct and
                                   accurate operation of CEMAS.

                                   Abstracts Produced. A “Y” in this field produces planning
                                   abstracts under program control. Final abstracts are pro-
                                   duced by assigning an agreed delivery date.

                                   Other Charge. This figure is added to all items ordered
                                   with a purchase order priority of O and is added to all pri-
                                   ority O receipts. Receiving personnel can allow or disallow
                                   charges based on specific contract terms.

                                   Urgent Charge. This figure is added to all items ordered
                                   and received with a priority U and can be allowed or disal-
                                   lowed based on specific contract terms.

                                   Emergency Charge. This charge is added to all items or-
                                   dered and received with a priority E and can be allowed or
                                   disallowed based on contract terms.

                                   Non-priced Item Charge. This charge is added to all items
                                   ordered without a scheduled item code, and is only applica-
                                   ble if non-price listed (NPL) purchases and charges are in-
                                   cluded in the COCESS contract.

                                   Operating Cost. This field is used to enter monthly or
                                   other types of operating charges for COCESS services.

                                   Not in Stock Ticket (NIST). This field is used to provide a
                                   listing of all items that have had NISTs processed. The
                                   number of days stated in the COCESS contract for refill of
                                   stocks is entered in this block. This listing is used by the
                                   QAE to ensure the COCESS contractor has replenished
                                   NIST items.

                                   NPL Percent Variances. This field is used to provide mes-
                                   sages upon receipt of material. If the actual cost of the item
                                   varies more than the percentage input in this field and the

Chapter 17 CEMAS/BCAS Interface Parameters
17.1 Interface Parameters          Data must be input into the CEMAS/BCAS Interface In-
                                   formation screen for the interface to work. The required
                                   data elements are:
                                   (1)    Transmission times. There are spaces for up to ten
                                          transmission times, but not all require entries. These
                                          times must be entered in the 24-hour format. Varia-
                                          tions include 1000, 1100, 1200, and 1300.
                                   (2)    Background status. The indicator sets the back-
                                          ground task (RUNBCAS in MLOGPROC) mode.
                                          “Y” starts the interface operation which starts the
                                          background task and begins updating files as neces-
                                          sary. “S” suspends the interface, canceling the op-
                                          eration and halting file updates.
                                   (3)    Last communication time/date. The time and date of
                                          the last pass completed to BCAS is shown.
                                   (4)    Communication control number. Each site or host in
                                          the system is identified by the PR number which
                                          will be set to zero unless there are sites operating
                                          through the system to separate CEMAS databases.
                                   (5)    Transmittal status. If BCAS is supporting a single
                                          CEMAS location, use code B to represent support
                                          directly from host to BCAS. CEMAS can support
                                          up to four sites; if BCAS is supporting host and site
                                          operations, use code H to indicate the transmittal
                                          will flow first to the host, and then to BCAS. Use a
                                          constant FC and appropriate SRAN to identify
                                          Variances File PR Consistent for Each Site and in-
                                          put the system name for each site to allow for
                                          proper communication of transactions to and from
                                          sites.
                                   (6)    Transfer Group. The field in the Transfer-Group
                                          contains the DEFAULTXFGROUP agreed upon by
                                          both communities. If these entries do not match, the
                                          file transfer will be unsuccessful.
                                   (7)    Branch Section Code. The field defaults to U9, but
                                          can be modified by contracting personnel. Coordi-
                                          nate with Contracting before beginning on-line in-
                                          terface actions.
                                   (8)    Location of files in the receiving section. This is the
                                          location where the files sent from CEMAS are
                                          placed in the BCAS system and must be filled for
                                          proper communication.

                                                            NOTE
                                  Input the volume where the CEMAS data files are
                                  stored at the host site. Ensure the previous entries are
                                  made and all other required entries are made to support
                                  system networking. Problems with the system setup
                                  should be directed to MAJCOM


17.2 Interface Data             There are six data files associated with BCAS interface. If
                                the BCAS interface switch in the CEMAS variable file is
                                set to an “N,” the interface is not active and records written
                                to these files are scratched during the end-of-session proc-
                                essing. If the switch is set to “Y,” then appropriate action is
                                taken and files will be passed between the two systems to
                                update the necessary data files. These data files are:

                                The @MBCL file used to produce transactions received
                                from BCAS. As transactions are processed in the
                                ALQCEM and MCSF files, transactions are put into this
                                file. Program MCIPEOD in MLOGOBJ processes this file
                                during end-of-session processing and produces the listing.

                                The MCSF file is used by the interface program to hold
                                ALQCEM transactions received from BCAS until they are
                                processed. This allows the ALQCEM file to be deleted and
                                to allow for passing the next ALQCEM file from Con-
                                tracting.

                                The ALQ1IL file must be stored in the same library and
                                volume as the MCIP file (located in the mapping file). This
                                data file contains item add records to be transmitted to
                                BCAS to update item descriptions. These are 80-character
                                records with the description in 40-character bits. Up to
                                2000 characters of description can be transmitted in this
                                manner. A header record with the stock number sets up
                                each description with as many as 40 additional records
                                linked to it for passing the complete description.

                                The ALQCEM file contains transactions received from the
                                BCAS will only be present a short time after it is received
                                from the BCAS computer. Once the file is received, the
                                MBCASINF program immediately begins processing rec-
                                ords to the MCSF file and performing updates to all appli-
                                cable data files. The data files updated will depend on the
                                type of transaction received. Once all transactions are
                                written to the MCSF, the ALQCEM file is deleted. This

                                   allows another file to be sent from BCAS almost immedi-
                                   ately, if desired.

                                   The AUTOCUST file must be stored in the same library
                                   and volume as the MCIP file (located in the mapping file).
                                   It contains all transactions not previously transmitted to
                                   Contracting and is built from transactions held in the
                                   MBCA file that have an “N” indicator. The “N” indicator
                                   results from having been previously sent to BCAS and fol-
                                   low-up and receipt actions generated from the purchase or-
                                   der file. The MBCASINF program pulls records from the
                                   MBCA file and creates transactions in the AUTOCUST
                                   file.

                                   The MBCA file must be stored in the same library and vol-
                                   ume as the MCIP file (located in the mapping file). It con-
                                   tains all requisition transactions requiring passing to BCAS.
                                   The records are screened to see if they have been previ-
                                   ously passed. Unsent records are moved to the
                                   AUTOCUST file and transmitted to BCAS. Transactions
                                   received from BCAS delete records from this file.

17.3 Actual Interface              As BCE processing occurs, transactions are input to the
     Actions                       AUTOCUST and ALQ1IL files awaiting transmission to
                                   BCAS. This happens when:
                                   (1)    bills-of-material are firmed,
                                   (2)    line-item requisitions are processed, and
                                   (3)    end-of-session programs identify unawarded re-
                                          quests requiring follow-up or awarded items with
                                          past due delivery dates.
                                   The CEMAS interface procedure runs in the background
                                   and waits for the identified time to pass the files to Con-
                                   tracting. These files are automatically passed under pro-
                                   gram control.

17.3.1 Base Contracting            Internal Program Actions. The BCAS interface procedure
       Actions                     runs in the background and when it finds CEMAS files it
                                   begins to process them. The first items to be processed are
                                   the item loads by the CEMAS program. This program pro-
                                   cesses the description loads from the ALQ1IL file into the
                                   BCAS item and nomenclature files. Once the item descrip-
                                   tions are loaded, the demands program (@#DMD) is run
                                   and the customer transactions are processed from the
                                   AUTOCUST file. As transactions are processed from the
                                   AUTOCUST file, several different actions are performed
                                   by the BCAS programs.

                                Requisitions (A0A) Program ensures the stock number is
                                loaded in the item description file. If it is, an abstract is cre-
                                ated and printed for buying action and a follow-up (AE1)
                                transaction is created for transmission to CEMAS with BD
                                status. This action indicates the BCAS system received the
                                request and buying action should be underway. If the stock
                                number is not loaded in the item description file, a follow-
                                up transaction is created with a Z3 status, indicating the
                                problem (CEMAS will automatically send another item de-
                                scription with it receives the Z3 status).

                                The Follow-up (AF1/AK1) request causes the program to
                                check the awarded purchase request file for the document
                                number in the AF1/AK1. An AFI is a follow-up on
                                awarded requests and an AK1 is a cancellation request fol-
                                low-up. If the document number is loaded, a follow-up re-
                                quest notice is created and printed and an estimated deliv-
                                ery date (EDD) transaction is generated to be sent to
                                CEMAS. The EDD transaction will contain a follow-up
                                date approximately 15 calendar days from the current date.
                                This provides Contracting time to contact the vendor and
                                obtain a new EDD for the item. Once the new date is es-
                                tablished, BCAS will generate an EDD with the actual es-
                                timated deliver date.

                                Cancellation Requests (AC1) programs check the open
                                and awarded purchase request files for the document num-
                                ber in the cancellation request. If it is found, a cancellation
                                request notice is printed for action by Contracting person-
                                nel. An AE1 with a B9 status will be generated and sent to
                                CEMAS indicating Contracting is attempting to cancel the
                                request. Once all AUTOCUST transactions have been
                                processed, the BCAS background checks to see if it is time
                                to pass the created ALQCEM file to CEMAS. At the speci-
                                fied time for passing to CEMAS, BCAS programs run a file
                                transfer and pass the file to CEMAS.

                                Automated CEMAS Actions. The CEMAS background
                                procedure will locate the ALQCEM file and begin proc-
                                essing required updates to the purchase order file and bills-
                                of-material to reflect accomplished actions. The action
                                completes the cycle of events.

17.3.2 Transactions Sent        Requisitions. A0A is a requisition or demand transaction.
       from BCE                 When a requisition is processed, an A0A is written to the
                                MBCA file. Ordering action and subsequent creation of an
                                A0A occurs from firming a bill-of-material, processing a

                                   line-item requisition, or during the end-of-session process-
                                   ing when CEMAS store reorders are generated. When the
                                   A0A is written the stock number used will depend on what
                                   is in the NSN field of the noun dictionary. If the NSN has
                                   an FSC only, then the program will pass the FSC, an L, and
                                   the CSL number. If a valid stock number is in the NSN or if
                                   the stock number has more than four characters in it, then
                                   whatever is in the NSN field will be passed as the stock
                                   number in the A0A transaction. If BCAS is supporting
                                   multiple CEMAS operations, the SRAN of the ordering
                                   base is added to the NSN created by CEMAS. This option
                                   is set in the CEMAS variable file.

                                   Requisition upgrade. AMA is an expedite or priority up-
                                   grade to a previously-submitted A0A, generated by up-
                                   grading the priority on each item in a bill-of-material in the
                                   purchase order file.

                                   Cancellations. AC1 is a request for cancellation of a pur-
                                   chase order. It is transmitted to BCAS and, if it can be can-
                                   celed, BCAS will send a local purchase cancellation (LCC).

                                   Follow-ups. An AF1 is a follow-up transaction on re-
                                   quirements that are past the agreed delivery dates generated
                                   during end-of-session processing. An ATA is a follow-up
                                   to an A0A. It is automatically submitted to BCAS within
                                   two calendar days, if there is no response to an A0A.

                                   Receipt Acknowledgment. The 1RA is an acknowledg-
                                   ment of receipt of property or reverse post action, generated
                                   by the action's processing. A “P” is a partial receipt, an “F”
                                   a full receipt, and an “R” a reverse-post action.

17.3.3 Transactions Received       Status. Status (AE1) is a status update transaction. The cur-
       from BCAS                   rent status and the action taken by the system depend on the
                                   code in positions 65-66 of the transaction. Possible codes
                                   are BD, BF, BP, B5, B8, B9, Z3, Z4, and PD.
                                   (1)    BD acknowledges receipt of an A0A transaction by
                                          BCAS. This is indicated by an estimated delivery
                                          date (EDD) and a date next follow-up (equal to the
                                          EDD) in the purchase order file for the requisition.
                                          The EDD represents the date the item is expected to
                                          be awarded.
                                   (2)    BF means BCAS does not have a record of the de-
                                          mand. This is a request to resubmit the demand
                                          (A0A) to BCAS. CEMAS will automatically re-

                                      submit the A0A and item description (1IL) for the
                                      item.
                                (3)   BP indicates the vendor has notified Contracting of
                                      a delay in shipment. A date will be provided and in-
                                      put to the ADD field of the purchase order file. This
                                      is the date the item is expected to be delivered
                                      (CEMAS adds five calendar days to the EDD pro-
                                      vided in the BCAS transaction and updates the
                                      ADD).
                                (4)   B5 indicates processing or awarding of a demand
                                      has been delayed indefinitely. CEMAS will auto-
                                      matically follow up on this demand in 15 calendar
                                      days. Once the initial follow-up is generated, addi-
                                      tional follows are generated on a periodic basis until
                                      acceptable status is provided.
                                (5)   B8 indicates cancellation action cannot be done.
                                      The item will remain on order and will require re-
                                      ceipt.
                                (6)   B9 indicates Contracting is attempting to cancel an
                                      awarded requisition based on your request. This
                                      transaction updates the date of next follow-up field
                                      in the purchase order file. If the date next follow-up
                                      is reached, another AF1 will be processed to BCAS.
                                      Monitor the number of follows on purchase requests
                                      to ensure action is taken by the Contracting Follow-
                                      up Section and the systems are not just passing
                                      transactions back and forth. If the cancellation is
                                      achieved, you will receive an LCC transaction.
                                (7)   Z3 indicates the item description does not exist in
                                      the contracting system. The CEMAS system auto-
                                      matically generates a new item description transac-
                                      tion (1IL) and passes it to Contracting in the next
                                      transmission.
                                (8)   Z4 indicates insufficient data and requires more in-
                                      formation before Contracting can purchase the item.
                                      This could mean the part number could not be com-
                                      pared to local vendor information, or insufficient
                                      description to purchase the item. This must be
                                      manually corrected for Contracting to purchase the
                                      item.
                                (9)   PD means pier delivery (overseas only).

                                                             NOTE
                                     A report on all (POF) records with the date awarded
                                     greater than zero and the ADD not equal to the esti-
                                     mated delivery date would provide information on de-
                                     layed shipment items.

                                   Estimated Delivery Date (EDD). This is a change in the
                                   original EDD of item. The date supplied in the transaction
                                   updates the ADD in the purchase order record. If the EDD
                                   transaction contains ROPEN in columns 4-8, the purchase
                                   order award information is deleted. This transaction is gen-
                                   erated as a result of follows generated by the system be-
                                   cause of expired EDD/ADD or a requirement has been un-
                                   awarded (award canceled) by Contracting (unawarded
                                   items would have ROPEN in the transaction).

                                   Local Purchase Cancellation (LCC). This transaction is
                                   usually produced in response to a request for cancellation.
                                   It will delete the purchase order record and change the or-
                                   der flag in the associated work order record, if any, to a
                                   “C.”

                                   Award Adjustment (LPA). An LPA modifies the pur-
                                   chase order record to reflect changes made to a previously
                                   awarded purchase request. If there is an associated work
                                   order record (BMI/BMF), it is adjusted as required.

                                   Local Purchase Status (LPS). This transaction updates the
                                   purchase order record and shows award information. The
                                   LPS is followed by an LPX. Award information is not up-
                                   dated unless both the LPS and LPX are found during the
                                   BCAS/CEMAS interface process.

                                   Local Purchase Information (LPX). This transaction is a
                                   trailer portion of the LPS transaction. The LPS transaction
                                   format does not contain the complete purchase or-
                                   der/blanket purchase order and call number for awards.
                                   This transaction contains the remaining information re-
                                   quired.


17.3.4 Priority Requests and       Coordinate transmission of “priority requests” and off-line
       Off-line Actions            (when BCE is without a computer) requisitions between
                                   Contracting and BCE and take one of the following actions:
                                   (1)    Submission of Priority Requests. Use of RLOGON
                                          techniques or personal computers allows BCE to

AFPAM32-1004V4 1 SEPTEMBER 1998                         Working in the Operations Flight

                                       bypass normal CEMAS processing and input prior-
                                       ity requests directly into BCAS. Contracting buyers
                                       may then immediately begin purchase actions.
                                       Normal CEMAS/BCAS transactions for these in-
                                       puts will reject as duplicates, but will cause no
                                       problems to either system.
                                (2)    Off-line Requisitioning. Base Contracting and BCE
                                       personnel should develop local procedures to handle
                                       situations when either of their computers is inoper-
                                       able. If the BCE computer is inoperable, BCE per-
                                       sonnel may expand or use procedures similar to
                                       those in the “submission of priority requests.” The
                                       “RLOGON” process would allow BCE to input
                                       item descriptions and demand requests.

17.3.5 Coordination between     Working with Base Contracting is essential to making the
       Base Contracting and     CEMAS/BCAS interface work. Both Contracting and BCE
                                personnel will closely monitor computer actions and prod-
       BCE
                                ucts to ensure mission accomplishment. At least weekly,
                                and during the initial implementation of the interface, Base
                                Contracting and BCE should meet to review system prob-
                                lems and status indicators. After the implementation and
                                when personnel are more familiar with how the interface
                                operates, the meetings may be reduced to monthly and,
                                eventually, to an as-required basis. However, both organi-
                                zations should maintain a close liaison to ensure the suc-
                                cess of the interface. Both Base Contracting and BCE per-
                                sonnel should observe first-hand processing actions of both
                                systems. System administrators should observe how the
                                interface works at both ends. A thorough understanding of
                                both sides of the interface will ensure its success.

17.3.6 CEMAS/BCAS               Table 3, CEMAS/BCAS Interface, shows transactions sent
       Interface Transactions   from CEMAS and transactions which should be received.
                                This table can be used as a checklist to monitor the inter-
                                face using Transactions Transmitted/Received from
                                CEMAS/to BCAS. This list is not all inclusive and is only
                                intended as a guide. Table 4, BCAS Status Transactions,
                                identifies BCAS status transactions and provides a brief
                                description of the meaning of the status codes. All status
                                codes come in AE1 transactions.

17.3.7 Troubleshooting the         There are several areas to check if the interface is not
       Interface                   working and files are not being transferred.
                                   (1)    Is the background procedure set to run? Make sure
                                          the suspend/restart switch in the BCAS Interface
                                          System Screen in program MSYSUD/MLOGOBJ is
                                          set to a “Y.” Also check the last time a file was
                                          transmitted to Contracting. This is shown in the
                                          Last Communication Time/Date fields. This may
                                          give you an idea as to how long the problem has
                                          existed.

                                (2)   Is the background procedure running? Ensure the
                                      MBCASINF interface procedure is running as a
                                      background task. This can be done by looking in the
                                      interactive tasks area on the operator’s screen and
                                      looking for the MBCASINF procedure.
                                (3)   Are there files stuck in the transmit queue? Check
                                      the Transmit Queue for ALQ1IL/AUTOCUST files
                                      being held that have not been transmitted. This may
                                      indicate FTM manager problems.

                                             Are communications allowed for logons and
                                             file transfers? Ensure file transfer and log-
                                             ons are not inhibited in the telecommunica-
                                             tions area.

                                             Is there communication between the Con-
                                             tracting and BCE computers? Run program
                                             “RLOGON” and attempt to logon to your
                                             contracting system using any userid and
                                             password. If you get a message stating “In-
                                             valid USERID or Password” you know you
                                             have reached the other system and the
                                             problem is probably not in the communica-
                                             tion-line.

                                             Check ALQ1IL/MLOGDATA and
                                             AUTOCUST/MLOGDATA for number of
                                             extents. If the files have reached 13 extents,
                                             they require reorganization. Take required
                                             action and reprocess interface actions.

                                (4)   Do you have a communications line problem? If
                                      telecommunications are set up as required and the
                                      CNS manager indicated there is no communications
                                      link, call the local Communications organization for
                                      a check of the line. Request the communications
                                      people to log out the communications circuit. Fur-
                                      nish them with required information.

                                             The communications organization may ask
                                             that the modem be turned on and off (wait at
                                             least 20 seconds before you turn it back on).

                                             Communications may ask that a AUD BUS
                                             test be conducted. Pull the front cover down
                                             on your modem and press the AUD BUS

                                   switch. Test the line and communications
                                   can tell if the line is down. They may also be
                                   able to tell if the problem is in the contract-
                                   ing line.

                                   If the contracting line is down, the Con-
                                   tracting system administrator should be
                                   called and advised of the problem.

Chapter 18 Document Management
18.1 Lost Document              Filing and audit control procedures require Material Acqui-
     Procedures                 sition to thoroughly research all lost documents. Research
                                actions should include: a complete search of the facility
                                where document was produced, contact with issuer and re-
                                ceiver as determined by transaction register or validation
                                listing, screening of files for misplacement of PMD, and all
                                other appropriate actions. Upon completion of a thorough
                                research, PMDs requiring filing which cannot be located
                                should be recreated.

                                                           NOTE
                                  Only those documents requiring signatures for audit
                                  purposes must be recreated. All other documents may
                                  be recreated at the discretion of the area supervisor.

                                To recreate lost documents:
                                (1)    Notify the area supervisor where the document was
                                       produced to recreate the document.
                                (2)    Type or hand scribe PMDs and make sure they are
                                       legible.
                                (3)    Make sure the name of the receiver from the origi-
                                       nal document is annotated on the copy.
                                (4)    Have the area supervisor sign the copy as the re-
                                       viewing official certifying it as a certified copy of
                                       the original.
                                (5)    Forward the certified copy to the Chief of Material
                                       Acquisition or designated representative for signa-
                                       ture as approving official.
                                (6)    If results of the review process or trends suggest a
                                       potential for fraud, waste, or abuse, notify appropri-
                                       ate officials immediately.
                                (7)    Recommend all documentation be filed no later
                                       than three workdays after transaction processing.
                                       This action will help ensure backlogs are kept to a
                                       minimum.

18.2 Document                   The following documents, per AFI 37-138, are maintained
     Disposition                for audit trail purposes. MAJCOMs may elect to retain

Chapter 19 Control, Processing, and Storage of
           Hazardous Materials
19.1 Procedures and                The purpose of this chapter is to provide guidance to Mate-
     Responsibilities              rial Acquisition Elements in the control, processing, and
                                   storage of hazardous materials (HM). The intent is to re-
                                   duce the amount of hazardous materials purchased and es-
                                   tablish a control and tracking system for on-hand materials.
                                   Procedures must comply with Executive Order 12856 and
                                   be approved by the local Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE)
                                   or designated point-of-contact for HM. The BEE and Haz-
                                   ardous Materials Pharmacy must be contacted on all mat-
                                   ters pertaining to hazardous materials acquisition, control,
                                   and disposition. In some instances, it may be advantageous
                                   to establish a satellite pharmacy in Civil Engineer. Proce-
                                   dures developed will be jointly approved by the BCE, BEE,
                                   and the HMP. Local procedures developed at CE satellite
                                   operations must ensure all HM controls and reporting re-
                                   quirements are met. For the intent of this chapter, the base
                                   BEE is used as the approval authority on all matters perti-
                                   nent to HM. Delegation of alternate POCs/approval author-
                                   ity are used in some locations (for example, pharmacy and
                                   base supply).

                                   The Chief of Material Acquisition is responsible for re-
                                   viewing the current CEMAS noun dictionary to identify
                                   Potentially Hazardous Material (PHM) by Federal Stock
                                   Class. To conduct a wall-to-wall inventory to validate all
                                   PHM and quantities, the Material Acquisition personnel
                                   coordinate with the BEE. A listing of all PHM is prepared
                                   and forwarded to the base BEE and copies of any available
                                   material safety data sheets (MSDS) are attached. Material
                                   Acquisition personnel coordinate with the COCESS con-
                                   tractor to ensure an MSDS is available for each hazardous
                                   item issued and update the Environmental Management
                                   Information System (EMIS) or provide data to the EMIS
                                   POC for all issues made to CE shops. Local procedures
                                   determine the organizations responsible for processing up-
                                   dates to EMIS. Material Acquisition personnel may do the
                                   updates.

                                   After classification by the BEE, the CEMAS noun diction-
                                   ary record is updated with the appropriate Issue Exception
                                   Code and the primary shop authorized to use the item. A

                                                                                 Chapter 19

                                shop code is entered in the primary shop field. The use of a
                                shop code allows craftsmen in each shop the authorization
                                to use the approved HM.

                                The Chief of Material Acquisition is also responsible for
                                obtaining the BEE's approval in writing to stock maximum
                                quantities of HM in COCESS, GOCESS, and self-help
                                stores. The Chief ensures procedures are established to in-
                                put or pass pertinent data for tracking HM into the EMIS or
                                to the Hazardous Material Pharmacy. An MSDS file must
                                be established to ensure an MSDS is available for each item
                                identified by the BEE has hazardous. If an MSDS is not
                                available, the individual HM records are frozen and coordi-
                                nate with the BEE or the source of supply until the proper
                                documentation is obtained. Frozen material cannot be is-
                                sued without this documentation. Upon receipt of the
                                documentation, item records are unfrozen.

19.2 HM Research and            Research and Materials Acquisition personnel screen new
     Materials Acquisition      material requests and identify PHM as a part of the initial
                                research process. The base BEE or designated point of
                                contact determines if the commodity is available or if an
                                alternate product can be used. Approval from the base BEE
                                prior to first-time ordering of a PHM is required. (Local
                                procedures dictate the approval process.) A listing of all
                                approved shops authorized HM is kept and close coordina-
                                tion between the Material Acquisition Element and the
                                BEE is maintained to ensure HM is requisitioned for
                                authorized shops, only. Once approval is received from the
                                BEE, the CEMAS noun dictionary is updated to reflect the
                                item classification (“Y” in the HM field and the shop
                                authorized to use the item). The shop code is entered in the
                                primary shop field. Additional authorized shops can be en-
                                tered in the noun description field. After the noun diction-
                                ary record is updated, the requisition can be processed. Ad-
                                ditional approval is not required for subsequent ordering;
                                however, Material Acquisition personnel must ensure all
                                documentation is available prior to initiating requisition
                                procedures. Material Acquisition Elements may continue to
                                requisition HM through their own sources of supply once
                                they have initially obtained BEE approval for the purchase.

19.2.1 Receiving Hazardous      Local procedures dictate receiving locations for HM. If
       Materials                material identified as HM is received without proper docu-
                                mentation, the HM must be stored in a segregated area and
                                processed only after the proper documentation is obtained.
                                The MSDS is obtained by contacting the BEE or the base

                                   contracting activity. Base contracting obtains the MSDS for
                                   locally purchased HM.

19.2.2 Inventory Control of        The BEE, in coordination with the shop supervisor, deter-
       HM                          mines the maximum allowable HM to be stored in each
                                   shop. Units of issue is determined to best suit the needs of
                                   the individual shops. The amount of HM to be stored as
                                   shop stock is determined at each base. As materials are
                                   used and empty containers returned to the issue point, the
                                   shop will be authorized to order replacement materials to
                                   meet their needs. Material Acquisition personnel ensure
                                   only approved quantities of HM are issued to CE shops. All
                                   HM will be stored in accordance with DOD 4145.19-R-1
                                   procedures. Shelf-life information is carefully monitored so
                                   materials can be issued before expiration dates are ex-
                                   ceeded. Every effort should be made to avoid disposal of
                                   hazardous materials because of expired shelf-life.

19.2.3 Tracking and                The EMIS is used to track HM. Upon receipt of HM, its
       Disposition of HM           identification data is entered in EMIS. Responsibility for
                                   updating EMIS is determined locally. Procedures must be
                                   developed to track HM from receipt to disposal. Material
                                   Acquisition personnel may input the updates if an EMIS
                                   terminal is available. If no terminal is available, the Mate-
                                   rial Acquisition personnel provide updates to the desig-
                                   nated POC for EMIS input.

                                   When a shop no longer needs a particular HM, the user re-
                                   turns the container to the designated turn-in location and
                                   provides disposition of the used HM (for example, used in
                                   process, spilled, released as air emission, or requires HM
                                   disposal action). The disposition of the contents is entered
                                   in EMIS.

Chapter 20 Vehicle Fleet
20.1 Purpose                    Material Acquisition is normally responsible for manage-
                                ment of the BCE vehicle fleet. This includes all general-
                                purpose vehicles and special purpose vehicles, excluding
                                vehicles assigned to the fire department. The BCE assigns a
                                Vehicle Control Officer to manage the vehicle fleet and to
                                assure that qualified operators are properly trained in
                                maintenance and daily accountability of their assigned ve-
                                hicles. Specific responsibilities of the VCO include:
                                (1)    submitting vehicle requests,
                                (2)    making vehicle assignments,

Chapter 21 Self-help Store
                                Material Acquisition is responsible for management of the
21.1 Purpose                    self-help store. Self-help is a significant force multiplier,
                                especially in constrained budget environments. It is a
                                highly-effective alternative for managing limited resources
                                more effectively to improve quality of life for Air Force
                                personnel. A successful self-help program improves facili-
                                ties and fosters a feeling of pride and ownership. Sustained
                                involvement of base leadership is the key to a successful
                                program.

                                                          NOTE
                                  Detailed information on the self-help program is con-
                                  tained in AFPAM 32-1098, Base Civil Engineer Self-
                                  Help Guide. The guide provides the basic information
                                  needed to support your self-help program. It contains
                                  simple guidelines — a “road map.” It is not the only
                                  way to manage self-help, but does include proven
                                  methods

                                The core of any self-help program is the Civil Engineer
21.2 Basic Concept              Self-help Center (SHC). The SHC is a facility from which
                                materiel, loaner tools, and technical support, including
                                training and assistance, are provided in a timely manner to
                                base customers who want to perform self-help work. The
                                SHC should be manned and equipped to support “one-stop
                                service” for customers
                                Material Support
                                The SHC provides materials to supported organizations that
                                do self-help work within their capabilities. The SHC also
                                stocks minor maintenance and repair items such as paint,
                                electrical receptacle covers, commode seats, hasps, caulk-
                                ing, and tools. First sergeants, dormitory managers, facility
                                managers, and other specified people may be allowed to
                                draw these materials across the counter without submitting
                                AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request.
                                Minor Construction
                                 In addition to minor maintenance supplies, the SHC should
                                provide minor construction materials such as paneling,
                                sheet rock, suspended ceilings, floor tiles, and lumber. The
                                requester must have an approved AF Form 332 to draw
                                materials for this type of self-help work.

                                   Training
                                   Proper training is essential to quality work. Training can be
                                   an effective BCE work force multiplier when customers are
                                   trained to do simple tasks that they normally would ask the
                                   BCE to accomplish. A wide variety of commercial re-
                                   sources are readily available:
                                   (1)    how-to pamphlets,
                                   (2)    video instruction,
                                   (3)    how-to books,
                                   (4)    training seminars, and
                                   (5)    training aids.

                                   Customer Service
                                   The SHC should provide one-stop service from submission
                                   of the self-help request to receipt of the material and tools.
                                   The SHC manager should be authorized to approve AF
                                   Forms 332 (up to a predetermined dollar amount).
                                   Self-help Work Inspection
                                   Pre-inspection, in-progress, and final inspections of self-
                                   help work are vital steps in avoiding delays. Inspection en-
                                   sures quality workmanship and identifies problem areas
                                   early.
                                   Scheduling Priority
                                   The SHC manager should have authority to tap the re-
                                   sources of shop personnel when support is required.

                                manufacturing plants. (Exceptions are base exchanges,
                                commissaries, and other non-appropriated fund
                                activities.)
condemnation --                 A judicial proceeding started by the government

                                acquired or promised. This may be the appraised fair
                                market value of the real property or may include
                                protection of the real property against loss by fire,
                                water, or other causes, or any mutually agreeable
                                arrangement that does not conflict with governing
                                statutory limitations.
core requirements --            Process oriented descriptions which describe the tasks
                                needed to support Maintenance Engineering.
declaration of taking --        A pleading filed with a federal court of law in a real
                                property condemnation proceeding whereby, on filing

                                   declaration contains an identification of the land, type
                                   of governmental real estate interest, facility inventory
                                   information, recommended disposal dates, re-use
                                   rights, and services, obligations, and outgrants
                                   outstanding (see AFI 32-9004).
direct scheduled work order --     Emergency or essential work generally not requiring
                                   detailed planning, also known as job orders.
direct digital control --          Any control system (HVAC, alarms, lighting, or
                                   otherwise) using entirely solid-state (digital)
                                   components.
District Engineer --               One of the several Division Engineers, US Army Corps
                                   of Engineers, who supervise the activities of certain
                                   District Engineers and are the intervening management
                                   level between the Chief of Engineers and District
                                   Engineers (e.g., US Army Engineer Division, North
                                   Atlantic, CENAD).
easement --                        The right to use the land of another for a specified
                                   purpose. Usually, the owners of the land continue in
                                   possession and may use it as long as such use does not
                                   interfere with the purpose for which the easement was
                                   granted. An easement may be acquired for a specific
                                   term or in perpetuity. An easement differs from a
                                   license because: the privilege granted usually cannot be
                                   withdrawn during its term and it is considered to be a
                                   permanent interest in the property if the term exceeds
                                   one year.
emergency work --                  Work that must be accomplished immediately.
eminent domain --                  The right of the government to take private property for

Program (ECIP) --                  primarily intended for accomplishing energy
                                   conservation retrofits of existing buildings. It includes
                                   construction of new, high-efficiency energy systems
                                   and modernization of existing systems. ECIP is an
                                   OSD centrally-managed program.
Energy Savings Performance         Contracting with a private sector company for
Contract (ESPC) --                 completion of energy audits and installation of energy
                                   conservation projects. This provides a method to
                                   acquire energy conservation projects with no AF
                                   resources and without payment if savings do not result.

                                      digital control in that it includes both solid state
                                      systems and the older pneumatic systems.
engineers --                          Any engineer in Civil Engineer units to include the

environmental assessment --           A document, occurring early in the planning process,
                                      for evaluating the potential environmental impact of a
                                      proposed action. An assessment covers the same
                                      topical areas as an environmental impact statement
                                      (EIS), but with less detail. An assessment results in a
                                      decision that an EIS is necessary, or that the proposed
                                      action will have no significant effect, therefore, a
                                      finding of no significant impact (FONSI) can be made
                                      (AFI 32-7004).

                                      (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347), identifies and analyzes the
                                      anticipated environmental impact of a proposed Air
                                      Force action and discusses how the adverse effects of
                                      the proposal will be mitigated. It is prepared in two
                                      stages: a draft statement which is filed with the
                                      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and made
                                      available to the public for comment and a final
                                      statement which is revised to reflect comments made
                                      on the draft EIS (AFI 32-7004).

                                      energy audits, designs and metering programs. It
                                      includes construction of new, high-efficiency energy
                                      systems and modernization of existing systems.

                                jurisdiction of one government agency by another for a
                                definite period. These two uses of the term must not be

                                contractor agrees to provide particular items at a
                                specified price.

                                prices for a specific period of time. These are primarily
                                used to reduce administrative cost and buyer time for
                                purchasing high usage items such as CEMAS store
                                stock.

                                          Administration is the sole leasing authority for
                                          obtaining general purpose space in these areas.
value (current, fair, and estimated) --   As used in this regulation, these terms mean current
                                          fair market value or current fair market rental value, as
                                          appropriate. Fair market value is the amount in cash, or
                                          on terms reasonably equivalent to cash, for which the
                                          property would be sold by an owner, willing but not
                                          obliged to sell, to a purchaser who desires, but is not
                                          obliged, to buy. Fair market rental value of a property
                                          is the amount that, in a competitive market, a
                                          well-informed and willing lessee would pay and that a
                                          well-informed lessor would accept for the use and
                                          occupancy of the property for a particular term.
vault --                                  Storage location of base as-built and Base
                                          Comprehensive Plan drawings, so termed because
                                          many bases originally stored these drawings in a vault
                                          for physical security.
wetlands --                               Areas that are inundated by surface or ground water
                                          with a frequency sufficient to support, and under
                                          normal circumstances do or would support, a
                                          prevalence of vegetative or aquatic life that requires
                                          saturated or seasonally-saturated soil conditions for
                                          growth and reproduction. Wetlands generally include
                                          swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas such as mud
                                          flats, natural ponds, potholes, river overflows, sloughs,
                                          and wet meadows. Wetlands may be, but are not
                                          necessarily, located in floodplains (AFI 32-7005).
withdrawn land --                         Public land that has been set aside or designated for a
                                          specific public purpose, such as a national park,
                                          wildlife refuge, or national defense use. Withdrawal of
                                          public lands generally has the effect of segregating
                                          such land from lease, sale, settlement, or other
                                          dispositions under the public land laws.
work center(s) --                         Civil Engineering Operations maintenance teams
                                          organized to maintain and repair base facilities and
                                          infrastructure systems. Depending on the installation,
                                          these Centers can be classified as either shops, zones or
                                          a combination of both..
work orders --                            Work requiring detailed planning or capitalization of
                                          the real property records.

Attachment 3 CEMAS Transaction Register Identification Codes (TRIC)
The purpose of a TRIC is to properly identify transactions that occur within the CEMAS system.
These codes enable you to track actions in sequence as they occur and are reflected on the trans-
action register available on-line within CEMAS and on the transaction register produced during
end-of-session processing.
