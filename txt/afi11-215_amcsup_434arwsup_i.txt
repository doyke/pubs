                                             Chapter 2

                  FLIGHT MANUAL PROGRAM (FMP) PUBLICATIONS

2.1. General. The following manuals are governed by this instruction: Basic Flight Manuals (-1
series), Air Refueling Procedures (1-1C-1 series), Basic Weight Checklist and Loading Data (-5
series), Functional Check Flight (-6CF series), Cargo Aircraft Loading Manuals (-9 series),
Cargo Aircraft Nuclear Weapon Loading (-16 series), Nuclear Weapon Delivery (-25 through -
31 series), Non-nuclear Munitions Delivery (-34 series) and Mission Operation (-43 series).
     2.1.1. NATO Allied Tactical Publication, ATP-56(B), Air-To-Air Refueling, has become the
     primary source to provide aircrew with internationally standardized definitions, abbreviations
     and procedures to enable successful and safe Air-to-Air Refueling AAR operations. For
     aircraft with an in-flight refueling capability, the relevant TO-1 series provides supplemental
     MDS specific information on AAR orbit and rendezvous and procedures concerning
     tanker/receiver       formations.            ATP        56(B)     can       be     found     at
     http://www.raf.mod.uk/downloads/airtoair56b.cfm.
     2.1.2. ATP-56(B) offers information pertinent to refueling with boom, probe and drogue
     equipped HC/MC-130, KC-135, KC-10 and KC-45 aircraft. The appropriate tanker National
     Annex provides information crucial to successful AAR from allied tankers.
2.2. Responsibilities.
     2.2.1. PMs/SPDs of military aircraft acquisition programs will:
        2.2.1.1. Establish a FMP when setting up a TO Management Agency (see TO 00-5-1).
        This responsibility extends for the life of the system and includes complete flight manual
        coordination responsibility across the AF system.
        2.2.1.2. Appoint a qualified (see paragraph 5.1.1) FMM to manage the FMP for the life
        of the aircraft program. This includes initial acquisition and verification, maintenance and
        periodic reviews.
        2.2.1.3. Establish procedures to ensure FMP records are maintained for the life of the
        program. Records include: applicable source data, certification documents, verification
        records, waiver documents, change requests, FMRC minutes and Deficiency Reports that
        affect the flight manuals. When two qualified FMMs are assigned, one at the Product
        Center (PC) during acquisition and one at the Air Logistics Center (ALC) for life cycle
        management under the Capabilities-Based delivery and sustainment concept, establish
        procedures to ensure FMP direction is coordinated and FMP records are maintained.
        2.2.1.4. Ensure flight manuals for which the PM is responsible are addressed in the
        MDS/weapon system-specific Comprehensive Air Force Technical Order Plan
        (CAFTOP) annex. Use CAFTOP data to report flight manual currency metric on a
        quarterly basis.
        2.2.1.5. Ensure flight test programs contain adequate instructions to gather data for flight
        manuals. See MIL-DTL-7700G, Detail Specification, Flight Manuals, Air Refueling
        Procedures, and Abbreviated Checklists for requirements.
AFI11-215_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 15 JUNE 2011                                                       9


      2.2.1.6. Ensure all program elements (engineering, logistics, funding, etc.) support the
      FMP and its schedule (Attachment 4).
      2.2.1.7. Ensure that all technical order management and support activities adhere strictly
      to the 00-5 series technical orders and the AF Technical Order System. Ensure that all
      FMP acquisitions are verified and certified in accordance with TO 00-5-3 and AFI 63-
      104, The SEEK EAGLE Program, for acquisitions involving aircraft-store compatibility.
2.3. FMP Publications.
   2.3.1. The minimum print quality for all FMP publications is Level III (Good Quality), as
   described in GPO Publication 310.1, Quality Assurance Through Attributes Program For
   Printing and Binding. These products require above average materials, printing,
   workmanship, quality control and commensurate production time. Products of this level
   require clean, sharp printing of single or multi-color work (general process color work) and
   halftone reproductions up to 150-line screen. Above average quality of the original copy,
   films, composition, reproduction proofs and typography standards are required to ensure the
   accuracy, durability and appearance of the finished printed product.
   2.3.2. Only the FMM (ALC or PC assigned) may change, add, delete, and rearrange
   procedures or information in assigned FMP publications, preliminary FMP publications,
   operational and safety supplements, TO/Preliminary TO change(s) and revisions as specified
   in TOs 00-5-1 and 00-5-3. This authority cannot be delegated to the MAJCOM level or the
   MDS engineer. The MDS FMM and MDS primary engineer will ensure an established
   process is in place which verifies accuracy of FMP publication engineering content to
   support weapon system/lead MAJCOM requirements. This process will include a quality
   review of FM content by the lead MAJCOM or its delegate. The MDS FMM must approve
   all MDS FM changes.
      2.3.2.1. (Added-AMC) Major contractor-acquired computer software program
      purchases or revisions (such as F/CAS, CFPS or AFMSS) supporting existing, new, or
      modified aircraft and weapon systems are certified by the developing or accepting agency
      before use by crewmembers.
      2.3.2.2. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC/A3V will approve other software replicating flight
      manual data for mission or flight planning. When a performance conflict is observed
      (between data produced by computer software program and manually extracted), the
      flight manual will remain as the source authority.
   2.3.3. A change or revision is the preferred method for updating flight manual publications.
   However, if a formal supplement is the most expeditious and logical way to provide critical
   information to the field, FMMs may issue the formal supplement(s) with the concurrence of
   the lead and using commands. Hold supplemental write-in changes to an absolute minimum.
   Incorporate, supersede or rescind supplements as soon as practical, but not later than one year
   from date of issue. If the lead MAJCOM and FMM deem that a supplement should remain
   past the one-year time limit, notify HQ AFMC/A3V and USAF/A4MM 30 days prior to
   expiration.
   2.3.4. Only use a supplement to update the basic publication. Do not use supplements to
   update information or procedures in a previous supplement.
10                                   AFI11-215_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 15 JUNE 2011


  2.3.5. Formal supplements affecting procedural checklists will contain temporary checklist
  pages.
  2.3.6. Interim supplements affecting flight crew checklists will authorize write-in changes to
  the affected checklist. If practical, temporary checklists pages (cut out) may be provided as
  an attachment to the interim supplement.
  2.3.7. The FMM will coordinate with lead MAJCOM before deciding whether to formalize
  an interim supplement. Replace interim supplements affecting flight crew checklists with
  formal supplements containing temporary checklist pages. Publish a formal supplement or
  change and complete initial distribution (ID) within 40 calendar days after dispatch of the
  interim supplement. That decision may depend on whether a formal change is near the
  publishing stage of development.
  2.3.8. For supplements affecting scroll checklists, maintenance or aircrew will make write-in
  changes on scroll checklists prior to use as directed by the supplement.
  2.3.9. All FMP interim or formal supplements will include a status page or a paragraph
  listing all current supplements outstanding against affected manual and checklist.
  2.3.10. If crews use the flight manual as their primary procedural source (instead of
  abbreviated checklist) while the aircraft is in flight, the Emergency Procedures (EP) section
  will only be updated using a formal change, unless the interim or formal supplement provides
  replacement pages (i.e., no write-in changes for the EP section under these circumstances).
  Temporary replacement pages are permissible. The time to publish the change will be the
  same as a formal supplement.
  2.3.11. Unless authorized by the MAJCOM with approval from the FMM or in MDS-
  specific AFI, do not integrate/combine checklists derived from different flight manuals to
  form single checklists.
     2.3.11.1. Unit developed checklists (e.g., fanfold, local checklists, etc.), to include
     performance data inserts, will not be used in lieu of flight crew checklists unless
     authorized in the AFI 11-2 MDS-specific volumes and approved by MAJCOM Stan/Eval
     and MDS FMM. When approved, as a minimum, these checklists will contain all items
     (verbatim and in order, unless specifically addressed in the basic flight manual) listed in
     the applicable checklists. These checklists will reflect the same change number, change
     date and applicable supplement numbers as the flight crew checklist for configuration
     control.
     2.3.11.2. MAJCOMs may authorize crewmembers not to carry specific sections of
     aircraft, weapons or refueling manuals and flight crew checklists that do not apply to unit
     MDS weapons systems or equipment. Crewmembers will maintain these sections as
     directed by MAJCOM Stan/Eval.
     2.3.11.3. MAJCOMs may add more restrictive items to flight crew checklists to enhance
     training, tactical operations or for special operations with the concurrence of the FMM.
     Send copies of these items to the FMM and review at the next Flight Manual Review
     Conference (FMRC) for inclusion in FM.
         2.3.11.3.1. (Added-AMC) Insert only current, approved checklists and information
         guides in aircrew abbreviated checklist binders. Information guides will be reviewed
AFI11-215_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 15 JUNE 2011                                                     11


          and approved by aircrew standardization at operations group level, at the 89th Airlift
          Wing (AW), or as specified in the appropriate operations-series instruction. HQ
          AMC/A3VM, in coordination with AFRC/A3VS and ANG, will review and approve
          aeromedical evacuation information. For all checklists and guides, indicate on title
          page the source of information and date. Send informational copies though command
          channels to the appropriate NAF/DOV, then to HQ AMC/A3V. For updates,
          revisions, and suggestions, send copy through command channels to the appropriate
          approval authority.
   2.3.12. MAJCOMs may authorize units to withhold supplements that do not apply to the
   aircraft they operate. If MAJCOMs use this authorization it will be identified in MAJCOM
   supplement to this instruction.
   2.3.12. (AMC) AMC and AMC-gained aircrews will only post supplements that apply to
   the MDS aircraft they operate.
2.4. Scroll Checklists. FMMs may develop and issue paper scroll checklists using official TO
revisions or supplements to help complement the basic and functional check flight manuals.
2.5. Supplemental Flight Manuals:
   2.5.1. FMMs will develop classified flight manuals and checklists according to MIL-DTL-
   7700G.
   2.5.2. FMMs will develop supplemental flight manuals and checklists for aircraft
   modifications intended to be permanent according to MIL-DTL-7700G. These manuals and
   checklists complement the basic flight manual and are incomplete without it. The source data
   and preliminary technical data (PTO) for these manuals will be verified in accordance with
   TO 00-5-3 and where appropriate will be certified in accordance with AFI 63-104 for
   acquisitions involving aircraft-store compatibility.
   2.5.3. As part of the formal flight test plan, MAJCOMs may develop interim modification
   flight manuals (MFMs) and checklists outside the formal TO development system.
       2.5.3.1. These manuals and checklists provide operating instructions and information for
       a small number of aircraft modified for engineering and flight testing.
       2.5.3.2. Only information and procedures resulting from the modification need to be
       included in the MFM since a standard flight manual is required for the aircraft. Data from
       the standard flight manual will be included in the MFM only to the extent required for
       clarity and understanding.
       2.5.3.3. MAJCOMs that conduct formal flight testing will establish procedures for
       developing these manuals.
       2.5.3.4. The information, data, and procedures in these manuals and checklists will be
       verified by the flight test crews in accordance with TO 00-5-3.
2.6. Commercial Aircraft Flight Manuals. Commercial aircraft (which have been certified by
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)) and are procured (to included leased or bailed
aircraft) by the USAF may utilize manufacturer provided flight manuals, including checklists,
provided the provisions of Department of Defense (DOD) MIL-PRF-32216, Evaluation of
 12                                 AFI11-215_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 15 JUNE 2011


Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Manuals and Preparation of Supplemental Data, have been
met. The provisions of this instruction apply to COTS operated aircraft.
2.7. Joint Flight Manuals.
   2.7.1. AFJI 21-301, Inter-servicing of Technical Manuals and Related Technology,
   prescribes the polices, agreements, and procedures for exchanging Technical Manuals and
   associated information on common-use equipment by military services and the Defense
   Logistics Agencies, (components). In development of new weapons systems, the PM will
   coordinate with the Lead MAJCOM/CC to determine if the provisions of a Joint Flight
   Manual meet the mission requirements for his aircrew (see paragraph 6.4.1.12 for lead
   MAJCOM responsibilities for Joint Flight Manual coordination).

     (ETIMS), (formerly Joint Computer-Aided Acquisition Logistics Support), the mail, or
     transmitted, whichever occurs first.
     5.2.15.3. Request issuance of formal supplements, changes or revisions to replace
     interim supplements affecting checklists after validating the contents of the interim
     supplement.
     5.2.15.3. (AMC) HQ AMC/A3V will review and coordinate with using commands all
     interim/formal safety and operational supplements before transmission/release by FMM.
  5.2.16. Every effort will be made to ensure FMP publication changes or supplements
  associated with Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs) are distributed before the
  TCTO publication, not later than 30 days prior to delivery or modification of the first aircraft
  affected. The FMM will coordinate with the TO manager to ensure concurrent delivery of
  manuals and associated checklists, supplements and TCTOs. The following options must be
  considered:
     5.2.16.1. Obtain guarantee of concurrent delivery from the print contractor through
     Defense Auto Printing Service (DAPS). If DAPS cannot guarantee, obtain guarantee and
     printing support from off-base printing facilities.

                             MAJCOM RESPONSIBILITIES

6.1. General Responsibilities. Using commands (including FOAs/DRUs) will ensure personnel
comply with this instruction, AFPD 21-3, AFI 21-302 and 21-303, and TO 00-5-Series
publications.
6.2. MAJCOM Flight Manual Program Manager (MFMPM): Each command A3 and
FOA/DRU (as required) will assign a primary and alternate Flight Manual Program Manager for
the command. Forward the names of these individuals to AFMC/A3V for inclusion on the
USAF Flight Manuals CoP whenever personnel change. The MFMPM will:
   6.2.1. Be the single point for flight manual issues for that command. For each weapon
   system in which the MAJCOM is lead, that individual (and alternate) will also serve as
   primary and alternate voting member of the FMESG (reference Chapter 3) and in addition
   the MAF and CAF MFMPMs will be voting members on the AF CTOM Committee.
   6.2.2. Assist in development of the MAJCOM TO digitization strategy for each weapons
   system for which the MAJCOM is responsible for, including new acquisition programs. All
   FMs are required to meet the guidelines established in the AF TO CONOPS. Provide USAF
   Flight Manual Manager with a copy of the TO digitization strategy for each weapon system
   for which the MAJCOM is lead at the beginning of each FY. Assist the SM/SPD and FMM
   in determining the scope of technical material to be included in FMs and the overall needs of
   the user. Update SM/SPD and FMM on new military specification, military standard, print
   and or paper requirements for budget inclusion in CAFTOP process.
   6.2.2. (AMC) AMC/A3 FMPM in coordination with the AMC ePubs Manager will develop
   AMC digitize strategy and provide a copy to the USAF FMM at the beginning of each FY.

   Commands, may designate or delegate this responsibility to a separate organization.
6.3. ALL MAJCOMs:
   6.3.1. Publish a listing containing the MAJCOM FM POC for each MDS that the command
   operates (PACAF and USAFE responsibilities for this will reside with the MDS lead
   Command). Forward this listing to HQ AFMC/A3V for inclusion on the USAF Flight
   Manuals CoP, include the name, e-mail and DSN. Additionally, each MAJCOM (and
   subordinate level) will establish a generic AMHS account address for receiving FMP
   information.
   6.3.1. (AMC) AMC 847 Recommendation For Change Publication CoP will maintain a list
   of HQ AMC/A3V POC for each MDS.
   6.3.2. Establish procedures for processing and coordinating all recommended changes (AF

     6.3.2.1. Ensure procedures prevent forwarding of duplicate of recommended changes.
     Use only one AF Form 847 (or electronic change process request) when the identical
     change proposal effects both the basic flight manual and its abbreviated checklist.
     6.3.2.2. Establish an electronic means to inform lead and using commands of the
     coordination requirements and disposition of recommended TO changes (CoP or AF
     approved secure web site). Ensure the originator is informed of the disposition of each
     recommended change at each level of the approval process; this may be accomplished
     using an online data base accessible by the originator.
     6.3.2.3. PACAF and USAFE will coordinate with respective MDS Lead Commands an
     appropriate process to ensure recommended change coordination and responsibilities are
     met.
  6.3.3. Ensure FMP publications are maintained in the highest state of currency and accuracy
  including the evaluation of assigned publications according to AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew
  Standardization/Evaluation Program.
  6.3.4. Ensure FMP publications are readily available to meet all aircrew and mission
  requirements. MAJCOMs will comply with the following instructions:
     6.3.4.1. Establish procedures for the accounting and issuance of personal copies of
     needed FMP publications in electronic or paper format to flight crewmembers on active
     flying status. Any flight crew member who requests a personal copy will have it
     provided. Do not issue new FMP publications until in receipt of all associated basic and
     abbreviated checklist changes. MAJCOM Stan/Eval functions may only withhold the
     immediate release of updates, excluding interim or formal supplements, until the updates
     are available to all crewmembers on weapons system within their command. Interim and
     formal supplements will be released immediately, unless supplement or notification
     instructions state otherwise or they contain errors that would jeopardize safety or
     operational posture, in such cases the safety or operational concern must be resolved
     within 30 days. PACAF and USAFE will coordinate, with respective MDS Lead
     Commands, an appropriate process to ensure procedures and responsibilities are met.
     6.3.4.1. (AMC) At the discretion of the unit commander, units may forego issuing TOs
     to individual crewmembers and elect to maintain publications for each assigned MDS
     aircraft. In addition, units will maintain sufficient publications for crewmember self-
     study, training, and FCIF library (include contingency; active duty, ANG, and AFRC
     interfly deployments). The unit commander is responsible for the accuracy of all TOs
     unless issued to an individual crewmember. Publish procedures in the unit supplement to
     the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 3. Commanders will appoint an assigned officer
     or NCO by letter at each operations staff level (down to and including squadron or
     detachment) the additional duty of Flight Manuals Control Officer, to augment and
     maintain the requirements of AFI 11-2MDS Vol 3, AFI 11-215, TO 00-5-1. Additional
     duty may be performed by administrative, squadron operations systems management
     specialists, personnel specialists, and operations management officers. When a wing or
     group consists of more than one collocated unit, the wing or group commander may
     consolidate the flight manuals' control responsibility. If this authority is used, control
     will be at wing- or group-level and managed within existing wing or group resources.

     6.3.4.2. Establish internal distribution procedures for electronic or paper FMP
     publications, including interim safety and operational supplements, so that flight
     crewmembers have all changes and revisions affecting required flight manuals, checklists
     and any associated manuals before participating in flight operations. PACAF and USAFE
     will coordinate, with respective MDS Lead Commands, an appropriate process to ensure
     procedures and responsibilities are met.
        6.3.4.2.1. As paper FMs continue to be the emergency backup for use inflight for the
        majority of the AF weapon system inventory, MAJCOMs may withhold release of
        digital media until paper is distributed (Note: FM printing costs are accounted for in
        the publication process (CAFTOP) and remain the responsibility of the PM/SPD
        office).
        6.3.4.2.2. Establish procedures to ensure concurrent use of scroll, electronic
        checklists and paper FMP products. PACAF and USAFE will coordinate, with
        respective MDS Lead Commands, an appropriate process to ensure procedures and
        responsibilities are met.
        6.3.4.2.3. To ensure a redundant system is in place to view FCIF Library anytime,
        establish policy to backup any electronically viewed publications kept in the FCIF
        library.

  FMESG conferences and FMRCs for command operated aircraft.
  6.3.7. Conduct a command analysis of applicable FMP publications, including nuclear
  weapon and non-nuclear munitions delivery manuals, for each FMRC. Send change
  recommendations to the FMM a minimum of 30 calendar days before scheduled FMRCs, or
  when the FMM requests. PACAF and USAFE will coordinate, with respective MDS Lead
  Commands, an appropriate process to ensure procedures and responsibilities are met.
  NOTE: Non-MAJCOM reviewed recommended changes (i.e., walk-ins) will be considered
  at the FMRC after all agenda items are covered.
  6.3.8. Identify to the FMM any unique requirements needed for the flight manual or
  checklist, (e.g., use of synthetic paper stock IPDF, new checklist style, etc.) at least 60
  calendar days before the FMRC. If funding differs from FY submitted CAFTOP, then
  coordinate for appropriate funding. PACAF and USAFE will coordinate, with respective
  MDS Lead Commands, an appropriate process to ensure procedures and responsibilities are
  met.
AFI11-215_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 15 JUNE 2011                                                    25


  6.3.9. Establish procedures in the command supplement to this instruction to identify
  publication problems that are not reported by an AF Form 847 (or electronic change process
  request), such as word omissions, typographical, printing or quality errors. If MAJCOMs
  conduct formal flight test include interim modification flight manuals (MFMs) and checklists
  development guidance in the MAJCOM formal supplement, include in it the review and
  approval levels of responsibility.
     6.3.9.1. (Added-AMC) Each MDS flight manual POC will maintain a list to identify
     publication problems not reported by an AF Form 847 such as word omissions,
     typographical, printing, or quality errors on the AMC 847 Recommendation For Change
     Publication CoP. OG/OGV and using NAF/MAJCOM representatives may update this
     list.
  6.3.10. Establish an internal process through MAJCOM Stan/Eval offices whereby a pre-
  publication review of flight manual changes or revisions can be accomplished for the FMM.
  The MAJCOMs will be provided 7 days between FMM’s editing process and the 10–day
  prepublication review process to review any changes in the FM. PACAF and USAFE will
  coordinate, with respective MDS Lead Commands, an appropriate process to ensure
  procedures and responsibilities are met.
6.4. Lead MAJCOMs:
  6.4.1. Are advocates for their assigned flight manuals and must respond to issues addressing
  status and use. Advocacy includes planning, programming, and budgeting for designated
  flight manuals and assisting in development of digitization strategy for FMs. Lead commands
  will:
     6.4.1.1. Fund flight manuals needed by all using commands.
     6.4.1.2. Ensure all assigned flight manuals for which the PM is responsible are addressed
     in the MDS/weapon system-specific CAFTOP annex and associated TO Information
     Spreadsheet (TOIS).
     6.4.1.3. Prioritize identified flight manual requirements with using commands in the
     yearly Technical Order Requirements Plan (TORP). The TORP translates the PMs/SPD
     CAFTOP Annex and TOIS into a year-by-year summary of requirements through the
     Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP). This prioritization will take into account both the
     availability of funding and how the allocation of funding impacts lead and using
     command war-fighting capabilities.
     6.4.1.4. Determine the relative priority of out-of-cycle requirements submitted outside of
     the TORP process with using commands and whether or not each will be funded.
     6.4.1.5. Coordinate with all affected MAJCOMs prior to approving changes to aerial
     refueling procedures for publication.
     6.4.1.6. Verify that all using MAJCOM routine and emergency recommended changes
     concur/non-concur responses have been forwarded to the FMM and affected
     MAJCOM(s) and ensure the respective FMM has all the submitted recommended
     changes prior to the FMRC (electronic posting and notification will suffice in both cases).
     6.4.1.7. Support the FMP acquisition process in accordance with the requirements of TO
     00-5-Series.

     6.4.1.8. Coordinate with all using commands prior to approving changes and
     supplements.
     6.4.1.9. Coordinate with AAC/WMYL on all recommended changes to MDS-specific -
     34 series tech orders that impact specific weapons.
     6.4.1.10. Determine MDS specific distribution requirements and procedures IAW 00-5-
     Series TOs and fully coordinate these procedures with the SPO, FMM and using
     MAJCOMs. Flight Manual products may be disseminated either electronically i.e.
     ETIMS or through approved conventional means. In extenuating circumstances electronic
     distribution may include the use of encrypted e-mail or posting and download from an AF
     approved secure web site or CoP in accordance with AFI 33-Series publications, however
     this is not the normal AF distribution method. At no time can unclassified/unencrypted e-
     mail be used for restricted distribution or classified data. DOD Public Key Infrastructure
     (PKI) encryption, as implemented in the Air Force Common Access Card (CAC), may be
     used to disseminate unclassified restricted distribution and proprietary data.
     6.4.1.11. Host a CoP that provides a single source for management of its AF Form 847
     FM change request for all other MAJCOM’s coordination.
     6.4.1.11. (AMC) AMC 847 Recommendation For Change Publication CoP URL is:

     AM-01&Filter=OO-TO-AM-01
     6.4.1.12. Coordinate with the other component services Lead organizations and FMMs to
     establish Joint use FMs (e.g. NATOPS) when required. MAJCOMs must balance
     component requirements with the AF requirements stated here in AFI 11-215 and other
     service component guidance. Include in the coordination and process development:
        6.4.1.12.1. Flight manual engineering authority, publication, review (quality
        assurance), distribution and change processes as outlined in this AFI and AFJI 21-
        301.
        6.4.1.12.2. Flight manual funding line of authority if it differs from AFJI 21-301.
        6.4.1.12.3. Modification flight manual publication, review, distribution and change
        process as applicable to test aircraft.

                     FLIGHT CREWMEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES

7.1. Flight crewmembers will:
7.1. (AMC)4. Flight manual currency will be determined by referring to the most current list of
effected pages, listing provided by the supplement status page attached to safety or operational
supplements or the supplement status or flyleaf page incorporated in the flight manual. Make
write-in entries to latest status and flyleaf page reflecting current listing of publications,
including interim supplements. Determine currency of checklist by referencing the status or
flyleaf page attached to supplements or the list of effective pages within the flight manual. Crew
members will complete a List of Effective Page (LEP) check of all technical orders and
checklists annually and IAW TO 00-5-1 and paragraph 8.1.2.
   7.1.1. Follow FMP publications, authorized supplements, and associated checklists during
   aircraft operations.
   7.1.2. Flight crewmembers will make write-in references to each affected paragraph in flight
   manuals to direct attention to current supplements. Make write-in changes to checklists as
   specified in the interim supplement in full, if practical. Pencil write-ins or typed stickers are
   authorized to accomplish write-in changes to pages. Write in changes can also be performed
   by using software programs that allow text edit/over write functions.
   7.1.3. Flight crewmembers may make notes in their individually assigned flight manuals and
   checklists. Highlighting of important information in personally issued paper flight manuals is
   permissible.
   7.1.4. Keep personal flight manuals and checklists current.
   7.1.5. Recommend FMP publication changes on AF Form 847 (or electronic change process
   request) as required.

                                            Chapter 8

 ELECTRONIC FLIGHT MANUALS, LIST OF EFFECTIVE PAGES (LEP) CHECKS,
                       AND DIGITAL DATA

8.1. General. Approval of electronic in-flight viewing of flight manual data will be delegated to
MAJCOM/A3 through the Stan/Eval function. Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)
is the minimum acceptable level of digitization, for primary crew positions (i.e., pilot, navigator,
weapon systems operator, flight engineer, loadmaster, boom operator, etc.). Apply this minimum
standard when using digital data as the primary source for accessing and using flight manuals (to
include electronic checklists) for flight through an e-tool (electronic kneeboard, COTS computer,
electronic flight bag, etc.). The SGML standard is set to provide an enterprise level model to be
used with ETIMS Common Viewer/Transformer. PACAF and USAFE will coordinate, with
respective MDS Lead Commands, an appropriate process to ensure procedures and
responsibilities are met.
   8.1.1. Approval for in-flight use of any type of personal electronic device (e-kneeboard or
   COTS computer) for viewing flight manuals (including checklists) in flight will be obtained
   prior to use. These devices must be certified and approved in accordance with AFI 11-
   202V3, General Flight Rules.
   8.1.1. (AMC) AMC and AMC-gained aircrews are authorized to use ePubs in-flight. Units
   will comply with the requirements of paragraph. 8.2.7.
   8.1.2. LEP checks are a comparison of the page and change numbers on each page of a FM
   with the data on the LEP.
       8.1.2.1. LEP checks are mandatory when changes and revisions to paper FMs are posted.
       When changes are posted, only the changed pages must be checked. When a revision is
       posted, all pages in the FM must be checked. If a digital TO file is used to print a FM
       then the FM will have an LEP posted.
       8.1.2.2. When FMs are distributed in both paper and digital format (e.g. IPDF/PDF) the
       LEP check will be entered in the Remarks window of the corresponding ETIMS
       (formerly ATOMS) record for the TO for the digital file and must be recorded on the
       paper copy. LEP discrepancies found in paper or digital will be reported to the FMM
       immediately. Discrepancies on PTOs will be reported to the FMM indicated on the title
       page of the PTO.
       8.1.2.3. LEP checks on digital FM files are only required when the TODO/TODA
       electronically posts (merges) a digital FM change file into the baseline FM file, to verify
       that the two files were properly merged (no pages omitted, duplicated, inserted in the
       wrong place, or deleted pages left in the file). The LEP check must be performed using
       the FM intended viewing software application as prescribed by the FMM (do not print a
       copy of the FM file to perform the LEP check).
       8.1.2.4. Annotate the title page or LEP with the date, type ―(annual/revision or change),
       and reviewer initials, as well as any discrepancies (missing pages, improper printing,
       etc.). For digital FM files, enter this data in the Remarks window of the corresponding
       ETIMS (formerly ATOMS) record for the FM or in the FM Notes of the corresponding
AFI11-215_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 15 JUNE 2011                                                     29


      FM in the ETIMS (formerly ATOMS) database. Discrepancies found on the LEP page
      will be reported to the FM Manager by the AF Form 847. LEP checks are required for
      commercial manuals with LEPs. Page checks are required for brief manuals or COTS
      manuals without LEPs.
8.2. MAJCOM Responsibilities.
   8.2.1. MAJCOMs will establish policy and standardized programs to manage the distribution
   and verify currency of electronic flight publications issued to aircrew members.
   8.2.2. MAJCOMs will establish policy to ensure printing complete flight manuals from the
   digital file is limited to a case-by-case basis to prevent configuration control problems and
   minimize excessive printing cost (Note: print cost for flight manuals are accounted for in the
   publication budgeting (CAFTOP) process). Printing small quantities of replacement pages is
   encouraged in lieu of requisitioning the entire flight manual. Any local printing will be
   accomplished using print qualities as outlined in paragraph 2.3.1. In addition, in the future
   some flight manuals may be sent digitally and printed on demand via the Distribute and Print
   Gateway through the Document Automation and Product Service (DAPS) Centers in
   coordination with the FMMs or print specialist working for the FMMs.
   8.2.3. The primary source for digital FMs is the TO Account subscription on ETIMS
   (formerly JCALS/Web ATOMs) and in the future GCSS. Alternate sources of distribution
   are the Communities of Practice (CoP) Web Pages as long as all FM data is updated and
   verified with the ETIMS source data.
      8.2.3.1. This method may be used with all unclassified, restricted distribution data,
      whether technical or not, including preliminary, interim and formal TOs, TCTOs,
      engineering data and competition sensitive data.
      8.2.3.2. Data to be uploaded or downloaded is sent through a secure ―tunnel‖ between
      the CoP server and individual PCs. Refer to 00-5-series of TOs for additional CoP
      distribution requirements.
   8.2.4. Unit commanders will determine the proper mix of paper and digital flight manual
   copies. Sufficient flight manual copies must be available for mission planning
   (commensurate with available computer viewing resources), in-flight operations and personal
   study.
   8.2.5. Personal copies of flight manuals may either be paper or digital copies as long as
   compliance with this chapter is met. Units that issue digital copies on portable storage
   devices (i.e. PDA, memory sticks, laptops, etc.) are required to establish a system of control
   to ensure distribution statements and data at rest requirements are met.
   8.2.6. Identify procedures and policy for marking and storage of digital TO/media on all
   devices (i.e. portable storage devices, including laptops, PDAs, thumb drives, etc.) IAW 00-
   5-series TOs.
   8.2.7. MAJCOMs who elect to permit the use of an e-tool for displaying flight manual
   information will establish policy and procedure for use and include it in the MAJCOM
   supplement. Specifically address the following topics in the MAJCOM supplement:
      8.2.7.1. Approved flight manual (or checklists) format for the e-tool display and crew
      position, who will use the device and the eTool FM update management process.
30                                   AFI11-215_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 15 JUNE 2011


     8.2.7.1. (AMC) Units will forward a listing of the material accessed via ePubs through
     their Reserve NAF (if applicable), then to HQ AFRC A3V or NGB/A3O. AFRC/A3V or
     NGB/A3O will then forward to the respective HQ AMC/A3V section for that MDS.
     8.2.7.2. Approved flight certified model and type of the e-tool to be used by
     crewmembers.
     8.2.7.2. (AMC) Units will forward a listing of hardware used for ePubs through their
     Reserve NAF (if applicable), then to HQ AFRC A3V or NGB/A3O. AFRC/A3V or
     NGB/A3O will then forward to the respective HQ AMC/A3V section for that MDS.
     8.2.7.3. If an e-tool is authorized for displaying flight manual information by the
     MAJCOM, applicable paper flight manuals will be available on the aircraft to ensure data
     redundancy (in case of viewing device failure). If a certified weapon system IETM is
     approved by Air Force weapon system PM/FMM and is acquired for use, MAJCOMs
     will establish a backup system (either e-tool or paper copy) for viewing FMs in flight. In
     the case where paper is used as a backup, MAJCOMs will establish procedures to ensure
     paper copies are properly maintained and posted concurrently with electronic version.
     This does not apply to aircraft which do not produce or use paper products, although they
     will ensure redundancy of an e-tool in case of viewing device failure.
        8.2.7.3.1. (Added-AMC) The program will be managed by unit OG/OGV. Units
        will detail their program in the unit supplement to AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3.
        8.2.7.3.2. (Added-AMC) Participating units will establish guidance addressing the
        following areas, as a minimum:
            8.2.7.3.2.1. (Added-AMC) Distribution of interim safety and operational
            supplements.
            8.2.7.3.2.2. (Added-AMC) Process to ensure ePubs are current and all
            participating personnel have the latest version.
            8.2.7.3.2.3. (Added-AMC) How to manage the program for units deploying and
            individuals who do not have access to a personal computer.
            8.2.7.3.2.4. (Added-AMC) Units will have a dedicated computer in a convenient
            location to allow aircrew members to expeditiously update the media used. The
            file to update from will not reside on a shared network to allow access during
            system crashes. Units will ensure the file is scanned daily for viruses.
     8.2.7.4. All available formats of a TO or TO update (paper, digital medium, electronic
     file) must be released concurrently to maintain TO configuration control. When dual
     paper and digital flight manual media exist, these media will be distributed concurrently
     by the FMM to all users to avoid data mismatch or obsolescence. If the FMM is unable to
     release both types of media concurrently, then using commands will be notified.
     8.2.7.5. Electronic and paper checklists should be maintained concurrently. However,
     MAJCOMs may establish procedures to allow use of one medium with the other medium
     non-current provided operators are notified and aware of the difference. MAJCOMS will
     establish which checklist will be used as primary reference.
AFI11-215_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 15 JUNE 2011                                                     31


           8.2.7.5.1. Some MDS may employ integrated electronic checklists uploaded into
           aircraft computers and viewed on aircraft displays (FMS) as the primary reference in-
           flight (in contrast to removable viewing devices such as a laptop, electronic
           kneeboard, PDA, etc.).
           8.2.7.5.2. There may be cases where the paper copy of the integrated electronic
           checklist (Flight Management System, FMS) update is not available for reference
           before flight. If a new software push to the aircraft was accomplished and the paper
           copies do not arrive at the same time, MAJCOM Stan/Eval offices will coordinate
           with the FMM to obtain and print an updated paper copy of changes from a FMM
           source site and distribute accordingly (this responsibility may be delegated).
           8.2.7.5.3. (Added-AMC) All aircrew members will carry and use the appropriate
           paper checklists. Paper flight manuals will be the primary document used in the
           event of an emergency. The use of electronic flight manuals in-flight will be for
           reference purposes only.
   8.2.8. When approving digital data for in-flight use, MAJCOMs must consider whether
   human factors/human effectiveness issues have been addressed in the electronic display for a
   specific data format and limit use where appropriate.
8.3. (Added-AMC) AMC Electronic Flight Manuals Program This is the AMC
standardized and centralized program for distribution of Electronic Publications (ePubs) to
Technical Order and Distribution Offices (TODOs). This distribution program is mandatory for
all AMC and AMC-gained units and their TODOs and is open to using commands. The ePubs
program is intended to standardize the numerous locally produced options currently in use
throughout the command and ensures compliance with AFNETOPs, technical directives, and
STINFO regulations. The three major components of AMC’s ePubs program are listed below.
   8.3.1. (Added-AMC) Sourcing all publication from the highest level source (AMC
   SharePoint Site). Tools are available to automatically update unit TODOs local ePubs
   storage.
   8.3.2. (Added-AMC) AMC SharePoint Storage for each TODOs local publications and
   material associated with that wing/group ePubs. Therefore, all items within a TODOs ePubs
   will be stored on AMC’s ePubs SharePoint servers. This central storage allows access of
   information by crewmembers when away from their home unit. It also allows similar units to
   view each other’s local information.
   8.3.3. (Added-AMC) Acknowledgement of change from TODOs. SharePoint servers
   automatically send notification to TODOs when changes to content occur. TODOs will
   acknowledge receipt of notifications and/or notify when requirement is complied with.
8.4. (Added-AMC) Detailed instructions for participation are located on the AMC
SharePoint site (https://cs.eis.af.mil/aircrewpubs/default.aspx) (Note: Make certain to
choose the email certificate when logging onto the site.) All command approved publications for
aircrew will be sourced from this website. This single source is essential in ensuring
standardization. In order for the above listed processes to work, unit TODOs will establish their
TODO work group on the AMC’s SharePoint website. Unit TODOs must request contributor
rights from the ePubs program manager or assistant program manager in order to upload local
 32                                      AFI11-215_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 15 JUNE 2011


guidance and utilize SharePoint’s global reach. The program manager and assistant program
managers contact information is located on the AMC SharePoint site.
   8.4.1. (Added-AMC) ePubs will include the following folders:
   8.4.2. (Added-AMC) Mission Design Series (MDS). All MDS flight manuals and
   associated governing directives required to be issued to aircrew members (if available in
   digital format). Only MDS specific documents will be loaded in this folder.
   8.4.3. (Added-AMC) All Global. The All Global folder will contain publications that are
   common to the MAF and or required to be issued to aircrew members.
   8.4.4. (Added-AMC) At lead command discretion, the above folders may be further
   divided.
   8.4.5. (Added-AMC) Local. Each unit will have a local folder for unit specific
   requirements. Publications residing in the MDS or ALL Global folders will not be loaded
   into the Local folder.
8.5. (Added-AMC) Storage The only approved peripheral storage devices are government
laptops, government issued external hard drives and read only CDs/DVDs. Thumb drives will
not be used on any networked government computer per AFNETOPs governing directives.
   8.5.1. (Added-AMC) The primary means of viewing publications is via a CAC enabled
   computer. Any secondary means of viewing or storing of publications will be determined by
   individual units. AMC is not dictating what storage device must be used by a unit deciding
   to use a storage device.
   8.5.2. (Added-AMC) Crew members participating in the ePubs program will be provided a
   set of current paper pubs prior to attending initial/recurring training programs, if required
   (i.e., AETC formal training courses or recurring simulator training).
8.6. (Added) (AMC) Unit POCs will familiarize themselves with the program through the
instructions and videos located on the SharePoint site prior to contacting the ePubs program
manager. The program manager will assist OGV/TODOs in assembling the ePubs folder and file
structure in addition to establishing contributor rights to the site to facilitate uploading unit local
publications. It is the responsibility of OGV/TODOs to manage office personnel that will assist
in keeping local files updated. The primary responsibility of OGV/TODOs for management of
the ePubs program will be to keep local publications up to date on the AMC SharePoint site as
well as updating publications from the master library. OGV/TODOs will review ePubs on a
monthly basis to ensure validity and currency. This review will be documented in a log located
on the Pubs Review tab of the AMC SharePoint site.
8.7. (Added-AMC) TODOs should place the most current ePubs program on a Local Area
Network (LAN) or common drive to reduce traffic on the AMC SharePoint site. This will
ultimately reduce download time for aircrew.
8.8. (Added-AMC) As a minimum, crewmembers will ensure ePubs are updated prior to any
flight or flight-related ground training events. This is done by double clicking on the ―update‖
icon located in your ePubs folder. While at home station, the program will look for updates on
the LAN. Off-station, the program will get updates directly from the AMC SharePoint site,
which will require the use of your CAC card. Crewmembers have no requirement to log into the
AMC SharePoint site before performing an update; however it may be necessary to configure

CAC certificates within Internet Explorer prior to running an update. Instructions for this can be
found on the SharePoint site in the Air Crew Pubs > Aircrew Pubs Library > A1_Instructions
folder. All questions or comments may be directed to unit OGV/TODOs or the AMC Electronic
Flight Manuals Program Manager listed on the AMC SharePoint Site.

               RECOMMENDING CHANGES TO FMP PUBLICATIONS

9.1. General. Configuration control of a weapon system is managed by the weapon system PM
or SPD. The PM/SPD has ultimate approval authority for changing flight manual content.
Submit recommended changes to FMP publications on AF Form 847 (use approved forms
available on the AF Publishing Website, http://www.e-publishing.af.mil or utilizing electronic
change process requests through the Enhanced Technical Information Management System
(ETIMS)), when available, according to the procedures below. When the ETIMS electronic
change process is available and implemented throughout a MAJCOM, it will be the only method
authorized for changing flight manuals.
   9.1.1. Submit emergency recommended changes for conditions that require immediate
   correction to prevent fatality, serious injury to personnel, extensive damage or destruction of
   equipment or property or inability to achieve or maintain operational posture. Submit routine
   reports for conditions that are potentially hazardous from prolonged use, have negative
   effects on operational efficiency; reduce operational life or general service use of equipment.
   9.1.1. (AMC) AMC active duty OG/OGVs will submit critical safety hazard notice by
   message to HQ AMC/A3V with an information copy to appropriate FMM. AMC-gained
   units will submit a critical safety hazard notice by message through their Reserve NAF (if
   applicable), then to HQ AFRC A3V or NGB/A3O. AFRC/A3V or NGB/A3O will then
   forward to HQ AMC/A3V with an information copy to appropriate FMM.
   9.1.2. Do not use the AF Form 847 (or electronic change process request) to call attention to
   line/word omissions, typographical, printing or quality errors usually corrected during
   scheduled reviews unless they cause misinterpretation or affect comprehension.
   9.1.3. The PM/SPD will ensure that all data having potential impact on the FMP that are
   generated from Quality Deficiency Reports (QDR), Engineering Assignments, Mishap
   Investigations, TCTO(s), modifications are routed through the FMM for proper evaluation.
   9.1.4. Use only one AF Form 847 (or ETIMS, electronic change process) when the identical
   change proposal affects both the basic flight manual and its abbreviated checklist. Units will
   submit AF Form 847s electronically. Every effort should be made to ensure the originator is
   informed of the disposition of each recommended change at each level of the approval
   process. If the recommended change is too large to fit onto one AF Form 847, note this on
   the submitted form and provide an attached word document or an edited version (using text
   editing/over-writing software) of an electronic copy of the FM or checklist.
9.2. Processing Routine Recommended Changes.
   9.2.1. Submit and process all AF Forms 847 (or ETIMS electronic change process request)
   through MAJCOM channels as outlined in their supplement (if applicable) to this instruction,
   in accordance with routing as outlined in Attachment 2 and in compliance with the
   instructions in Attachment 3. NOTE: Except for those weapon systems for which the NGB
   is lead command, all NGB units must send recommended changes to their gaining MAJCOM
   Stan/Eval office through the numbered Air Force (NAF) (or its equivalent), as outlined in the
   MAJCOM supplement. Information copies should be sent electronically to
AFI11-215_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 15 JUNE 2011                                                      35


  NGB/A3O@ang.af.mil. When electronic transmission is not possible, mail them to:
  NGB/A3, 1411 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, 22202.
     9.2.1.1. (Added-AMC) All AFRC units will route routine AF Forms 847 through their
     NAF, who will then forward to HQ AFRC. ANG units will forward to NGB/A3O. HQ
     AFRC and NGB/A3O will in turn forward to HQ AMC/A3V (Stan/Eval), HQ AMC/A3T
     (Aircrew Operations and Training), or HQ AMC/A3D (Combat Operations).
  9.2.2. There are instances where AF Form 847 change request could affect adjustment,
  configuration, modification, repair, servicing, and operational checkout of aircraft weapons
  systems and related equipment thus affecting corresponding maintenance TOs. In these
  cases forward a copy of the change request to the MAJCOM/A4 functional OPRs for their
  review.
  9.2.3. Authority for disapproving a unit-submitted recommended change rests with the
  parent MAJCOM. All disapproved recommendations will be posted on MAJCOM CoP for
  AF Form 847 coordination or returned to the unit, in either case they must include
  justification annotated on the AF Form 847 (or CoP) stating the reason for the disapproval.
  Disapproved recommendations are not normally forwarded to other MAJCOMs, but may be
  forwarded for additional considerations if desired. Disapproved recommendations may be
  resubmitted with additional justification under a new control number.
  9.2.4. Using MAJCOMs have 30 days to comment on recommended change suggestions.
  Comments on the AF Form 847 suggestions will be forwarded to the lead MAJCOM or
  posted on the lead MAJCOM CoP for AF Form 847 coordination. Lead commands will
  ensure all submitted recommended changes are forwarded to (or posted for review/action
  with notification) the FMM prior to the FMRC. Any MAJCOM disagreements will be
  resolved at the next FMRC.
     9.2.4.1. (Added-AMC) Any person may prepare and submit an AF Forms 847,
     Recommendation for Change of Publication, (Flight Publications). Send this form to the
     OPR at the same organizational level as the originator, except at the squadron-level or
     below. Send forms originating at or below squadron level to the chief of the unit aircrew
     standardization and evaluation, training or tactics branch, as appropriate. Send forms to
     the OPR at the next higher level for action. All levels will concur or non-concur citing
     specific reasons. Offices at or above the level of operations group tactics, training or
     Stan/Eval may disapprove AF Forms 847. Each level of endorsement will include a DSN
     telephone number, FAX number, and e-mail address of the endorsing official. If
     circumstances prevent sending forms within a reasonable time, notify the last endorsing
     agency of the expected action date as soon as practical. Status of submitted AF Forms
     847 may be checked at AMC 847 Recommendation for Change Publication CoP.
     9.2.4.2. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC/A3V will review and make final recommendation on
     all AF Forms 847. HQ AMC/A3V may appoint a unit as the command representative for
     unique aircraft with no expertise above unit level. This will constitute final action for the
     reviewing headquarters. MCOPR and FMM will determine processing course-of-action
     (hold for FMRC or process as operations supplement). Receipt of the formal change to
     the affected document, accompanied by written authority from the responsible
     headquarters, if applicable, is the only authority for implementing changes and revisions.
 36                                   AFI11-215_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 15 JUNE 2011


      9.2.4.3. (Added-AMC) Squadrons and OG/OGVs will track submitted AF Forms 847
      by utilizing any method of their choice i.e. database programs, spreadsheets, AMC Form
      104, etc.
   9.2.5. When the recommended change reaches the FMM, the FMM will forward it to the
   MDS ALC/PC engineering function for review (if required). If the lead and all using
   MAJCOMs have approved the change, the FMM may either publish the recommended
   change or hold the recommended change for the next FMRC, based on its urgency and
   MAJCOM requirements. If the FMM disapproves the recommendation either before or at the
   FMRC or it is disapproved by an engineering review conducted by an ALC/PC MDS
   engineering function, the FMM will annotate the justification for disapproval and return the
   form to the submitting MAJCOM (by posting on FMMs CoP) and address the disposition in
   the FMRC minutes.
   9.2.6. The FMM will notify the submitting MAJCOM of the disposition of all recommended
   changes by posting on the FMM CoP, in the minutes of the FMRC, and if required by e-mail
   within 30 days of receipt.
   9.2.7. Individuals should not submit an AF Form 1000, IDEA Innovative Development
   through Employee Awareness Application, in conjunction with changes to flight manuals.
   Submitting this form to change flight manuals may delay processing of valid recommended
   changes. This action may result in potentially hazardous condition, inefficient operational
   practices, or reduced equipment life. Individuals desiring recognition through the Air Force
   IDEA Program may submit a confirmatory suggestion (after-the-fact) in accordance with
   AFI 38-401, paragraph 3.9.1.
   9.2.8. The recommended change and routing process for ATP-56 flows differently than the
   normal AF Form 847 process and can be found in the ATP-56 manual. All previous
   paragraphs within this section (9.2) apply to recommending changes for flight manuals and
   include the FMM as the final approval authority. However the final approval authority for
   the ATP 56 is HQ AMC/A3VK. HQ AMC/A3VK will notify the MC/HC-130, KC-135,
   KC-10 and KC-45 FMMs of the approval/rejection of recommended changes that affect these
   FMs prior to ATP-56 publication/changes.
9.3. Emergency Generated Recommended Changes.
   9.3.1. Submit an emergency recommended change in the same manner as with routine
   submission. Mark the ―yes‖ under block 5 of the AF Form 847. Route emergency AF Forms
   847 as in Table 9.1. Forward information copies as with routine AF Forms 847.
   9.3.1. (AMC) AMC and AMC-gained units will annotate ―EMERGENCY
   RECOMMENDATION‖ as the first entry in block 17 of the AF Form 847.
      9.3.1.1. Emergency recommended changes will be sent to the parent MAJCOM (or
      FOA), with an information copy to the MDS FMM.
      9.3.1.2. Originating MAJCOM/FOAs/DRUs or MAJCOMs/FOAs receiving emergency
      recommended changes from subordinate units, must send approved emergency
      recommended changes to the weapon system FMM, AFSC/SEF and all using
      MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs operating the same aircraft within 48 hours after receiving the
      original submission. Other affected MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs must send their concurrence
AFI11-215_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 15 JUNE 2011                                                       37


        or comments to the FMM (with information copies to the submitting MAJCOM and
        AFSC/SEF) within 48 hours after receipt.
        9.3.1.3. The originating MAJCOM/FOA/DRU must send disapproved or downgraded (to
        routine)   emergency      recommended      changes     (including justification for
        disapproval/downgrading) to the initiating unit, the FMM, AFSC/SEF and other using
        MAJCOMs. The originating MAJCOM/FOA/DRU must process downgraded
        recommended changes as routine.
        9.3.1.4. The FMM must inform all MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs and government agencies
        using affected TOs of intended action on emergency recommended change within 60
        hours after receipt. If a recommended change is disapproved or downgraded, the FMM
        must include justification for this action.
        9.3.1.5. If any command has not received notification of the FMMs intended actions
        within 60 hours after its original approval message, they will take follow-up action within
        12 hours.

recommended changes must originate from a formal safety investigation. This includes mishaps
defined as Class A, Class B, Class C or Class E and events such as High Accident Potential
(HAP) and Hazardous Air Traffic Reports (HATR).
     9.4.1. Recommended changes generated as a result of an aircraft mishap will be written by
     the Safety Investigation Board (SIB) and submitted electronically to the parent MAJCOM
     Stan/Eval function of the mishap aircraft. IAW 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports,
     and when requested the MAJCOM Stan Eval office will provide a tracking number to the
     SIB. The parent MAJCOM Stan/Eval function will make a determination if the
     recommendation requires immediate (emergency) action.
     9.4.1. (AMC) HQ AMC/A3V will use the AFSAS ID number as the MAJCOM control
     number (tracking number).
     9.4.2. Annotate the AFSAS ID number in the unit identification portion of the AF Form 847
     for all safety investigation generated AF Forms 847 and check ―yes‖ under block 5. The
     AFSAS number will be the primary means of identifying safety investigation generated AF
     Forms 847. If the safety investigation generated AF Form 847 is also an emergency
     submission, annotate "EMERGENCY RECOMMENDATION" as the first entry in Block 17.

          RECOMMENDING AIR FORCE PUBLICATION IMPROVEMENTS

10.1. General. This chapter does not apply to flight manuals publications as specified in
Chapter 2. Unless different guidance is provided by the appropriate AF publication OPR,
submit recommended changes and improvements to Air Force publications on AF Form 847 (use
approved forms available on the AF Publishing Website http://www.e-publishing.af.mil
according to the procedures below and Attachment 3. Submit emergency reports for conditions
that require immediate correction to prevent fatality, serious injury to personnel, extensive
damage to property or a reduction in operational posture. Submit routine reports for conditions
that have negative effects on operational efficiency, to correct content errors or to recommend
improved procedures or processes. Do not use the AF Form 847 to call attention to word
omissions, typographical, printing or quality errors usually corrected during scheduled reviews
unless they cause misinterpretation.
10.2. Processing AF Forms 847.
   10.2.1. Submit and process all AF Forms 847 through MAJCOM channels as outlined in the
   MAJCOM supplement to this instruction in accordance with routing as outlined in
   Attachment 2 (with the AF publication OPR defining the process at the FMM level in the
   Attachment) and in compliance with instructions in Attachment 3. Units will submit AF
   Forms 847 electronically. Submitting organizations, below MAJCOM level, should forward
   recommendations to the MAJCOM functional OPR for the publication. For example, if the
   publication deals with a 36-XXX series instruction, the MAJCOM OPR would be
   MAJCOM/A1. The submitting MAJCOM will forward approved recommendations to the
   appropriate OPR. The ultimate approval authority for Air Force publications is the OPR as
   listed on the front page of the publication.
   10.2.2. The submitting MAJCOM will forward information copies of AF Forms 847 to all
   other MAJCOMs that utilize the AF publication. Using MAJCOMs will forward comments
   on AF Forms 847 suggestions to the OPR for the publication.
   10.2.3. Authority for disapproving an AF Form 847 rests with the submitting MAJCOM and
   the OPR for the publication. All disapproved recommendations will be returned to the
   submitting MAJCOM with justification annotated on the AF Form 847 stating the reason for
   the disapproval.
   10.2.4. The OPR for the publication will notify the submitting MAJCOM as to the final
   disposition of the recommendation.
   10.2.5. Ensure the originator is informed of the disposition of each AF Form 847 at each
   level of the approval process.

CAUTION—Is an operating procedure, technique, etc., which could result in damage to
equipment if not carefully followed.
CoP (Air Force Knowledge Now)—Is a web-based, collaborative workspace where members
use communication tools to conduct business, manage a project, keep abreast of important group
issues and solve group problems. Because CoP data transfers through a secure "tunnel" between
the server and the user's PC, they have proven a very useful way to post and distribute data.
Many TO managers now use CoPs to augment the distribution of unclassified, restricted
distribution data, whether technical or not, including preliminary, interim and formal TOs,
TCTOs, engineering data and competition sensitive data.
Distribution Statement—A statement used in marking a technical document, regardless of
publication media or form, to denote the extent of its availability for distribution, release, and
disclosure without additional approvals and authorizations from the controlling DoD office (see
AFI 61-204).
Electronic Flight Bag—is an electronic information management device that helps flight crews
perform flight management tasks more easily and efficiently with less paper. It is a general
purpose computing platform intended to reduce, or replace, paper-based reference material often
found in the aircrew's carry-on Flight Bag, including the Flight Manual, AFIs, and Navigational
Charts (including moving map for air and ground operations). In addition, the EFB can host
purpose-built software applications to automate other functions normally conducted by hand,
such as performance take-off calculations.
Electronic Technical Manual (ETM) (Type 1)—A manual containing technical data authored
in a linear fashion for the purpose of page or in-line presentation (Type 1). ETMs may have a
wide range of functionality ranging from indexed raster, hypertext linking, multimedia,
interactivity between the data and the user, procedural guidance, navigational directions, and
supplemental information. ETMs may also contain operational-support functions supplemental
to procedures and are displayed according to TMSS specifications.
Enhanced Technical Information Management System, (ETIMS)—Enhanced Technical
Information Management System (ETIMS) is intended to become the Air Force (AF) primary
tool to support warfighters by providing focused, timely, accurate, and complete technical
information in digital form at the point of use. When complete, ETIMS will allow personnel
involved in all of the major business process areas of the Technical Order (TO) system
(managing, acquiring, sustaining, distributing, storing, and using TOs) to carry out their
responsibilities and access their required data using current Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS)
technology.
Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM): (Type 2)—An "information oriented",
digital technical manual whose format and style are optimized for computer presentation. IETM
organization facilitates easy user access to technical information while the display device
provides interactive procedural guidance, navigational directions, and supplemental information.
It is technical data authored in a non-linear fashion for the purpose of non-linear presentation.
IETMS have the following characteristics: allow a high level of interactivity between the data
and the user providing procedural guidance, navigational directions, and supplemental
information; may provide assistance in carrying out operational-support functions supplemental
to procedures. It is displayed in non-linear data form according to MIL-DTL-87268C.

System is a joint service, distributed technical management information system.
Lead Command—The Air Force assigns responsibility for overall management of each system
to a ―lead command‖ to ensure that all requirements associated with every system receive
comprehensive and equitable consideration. The lead command provides a primary input into the
process of developing and maintaining a force structure with a balance of complementary
capabilities, and it establishes a basis for rational allocation of scarce resources among
competing requirements. When only one command uses a weapon or equipment system, it is
automatically assigned Lead Command. See AFPD 10-9 for aircraft systems and AFI 10-901 for
communication and information systems assignments. NOTE: Is an operating procedure,
technique, etc., which is considered essential to emphasize.
Program Manager (PM)—As used in this instruction applies collectively to System Program
Director, Product Group Manager, Supply Chain Manager or acquisition program manager.
Formerly Single Manager (SM). The designated individual with responsibility for and authority
to accomplish program objectives for development, production, and sustainment to meet the
user's operational needs. The PM shall be accountable for credible cost, schedule, and
performance reporting to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) in accordance with DoD
5000.1, The Defense Acquisition System.
Shall, Will, Should—In TOs the word ―shall‖ is used to express a provision that is binding. The
words ―should‖ and ―may‖ are used when it is necessary to express non-mandatory provisions.
―Will‖ may be used to express a mandatory declaration of purpose or when it is necessary to
express a future event.
STINFO—Scientific and Technological Information.            Information relating to research,
development, engineering, testing, evaluation, production, operation, use, and maintenance for
military products, services, and equipment for military systems. This includes production,
engineering, and logistics information.
System Program Director (SPD)—The individual in a SPO who is ultimately responsible and
accountable for decisions and resources in overall program execution. SPD is the designated title
for the program manager of a program that reports to a Program Executive Officer
(PEO)/Product Center Commander during the acquisition phase, or an ALC/CC during system
sustainment, and who presents the single face to the user while overseeing the seamless life-
cycle processes.
Technical Content Manager (TCM)—The individual, usually an Equipment Specialist (see
definition) or Engineer, responsible for maintaining the accuracy, adequacy, modification,
classification, review and currency of the technical content of TOs and TCTOs supporting
assigned systems, commodities or processes. TCMs are not generally responsible for style and
format or other non-technical aspects of manuals.
Technical Data—Recorded information, regardless of form or method of recording, of a
scientific or technical nature. Information that can be used, or adapted for use, to design,
develop, assemble, engineer, produce, manufacture, modify, operate, repair, test, overhaul,
maintain, or reproduce equipment and related technology.

Technical Manual (TM)—A document that contains operational or maintenance instructions,
parts lists or parts breakdown, or other related technical information or procedures (exclusive of
administrative procedures) for a weapon system, weapon system component, support equipment
or other item procured by DoD. This data can be presented in any form (for example hard copy,
audio and visual displays, magnetic tape, disks, or other electronic devices).
Technical Order (TO)—TMs developed to MIL SPECs or commercial manuals reviewed and
approved in accordance with MIL-PRF-32216 "Evaluation of Commercial Off-The-Shelf
(COTS) Manuals and Preparation of Supplemental Data, managed in the Air Force TO System,
and meeting the criteria for TMs listed above. The term Technical Order is equivalent to the
DoD term Technical Manual.
TO Manager—The TO Manager is responsible for managing some or all of the TOs for a
specific military system or commodity program. Management responsibilities include
acquisition, sustainment, format, publishing, storage and distribution of TOs and related
technical data IAW AFPD 21-3, AFI 21-303, and 00-5-series TOs. When acquisition is being
performed at a product center, and sustainment will be managed at an ALC, the PM will ensure
TO logistics supportability issues are coordinated with the candidate ALC TO Manager to assure
compliance with applicable technical data guidance. During system sustainment, many of the
below functions are performed by TCMs, Distribution Managers, and other support functions as
delegated.
WARNING—Is an operating procedure, technique, etc., which could result in personal injury
and/or loss of life if not carefully followed.

 52                                  AFI11-215_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 15 JUNE 2011


Section 1:   The first level is the submitting organization group/wing (or detachment)
             Stan/Eval function. Indicate whom the form will be forwarded to (i.e.NAF or
             MAJCOM). Annotate the appropriate level of concurrence. If you agree with the
             intent, but not the wording, then mark ―CONCUR WITH INTENT‖ and annotate
             the recommended wording in the remarks section.
Section 2:   The second level of review is reserved for NAF. They comply with the same
             instruction as outlined above. If there is no NAF function then the second section
             is left blank.
Section 3:   The third level of review is reserved for MAJCOM use. MAJCOMs will assign
             their control number (i.e., AETC 01-130) in block 3 on the front side of the form.
             If the submitting MAJCOM is lead command, then they annotate their command
             in the ―LEAD MAJCOM‖ block and forward copies to using commands of that
             MDS. If the submitting MAJCOM is not lead, they annotate who is lead and
             forward the original and information copies to the lead and using commands. Any
             AF Form 847 submitted by a using command and disapproved by the lead
             command will automatically be forwarded to the FMRC for final resolution. Lead
             MAJCOM forwards all coordinated AF Forms 847 to the FMM
Section 4:   The final level of review is reserved for the FMM or if the recommendation is for
             an instruction, the action officer responsible for the instruction. For flight
             manuals, if the using commands have concurred with the recommendation, the
             FMM will indicate ―CONCUR‖ and hold the recommendation for incorporation
             into the next change (or revision). If the FMM determines the recommendation
             cannot be accepted in its present form but still has merit the FMM will indicate
             ―CONCUR WITH INTENT‖ or ―FORWARD TO _____________________FOR
             REVIEW AND/OR ACTION‖ (Lead MAJCOM with recommended review
             and/or action) or hold the recommendation for the next FMRC. The FMRC will
             be the final resolution authority for disputed recommendations. If the
             recommendation requires additional review (i.e., engineering), the FMM will
             forward the form to the appropriate office and mark that block. The FMM (or
             final approval authority) must notify the submitting MAJCOM as to the final
             status and disposition of the recommendation within 30 days of receipt.
