                                                 Chapter 2

                                         DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Driving Privileges Requirements.
    2.1.1. Driving a Government Motor Vehicle (GMV) or Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) on the instal-
    lation is a privilege granted by the Installation Commander. If a person accepts that privilege, the indi-
    vidual must comply with the laws and instructions governing motor vehicle operation and registration
    on the installation. Consequently, upon request by the Installation Entry Controller (Security Forces or
    DoD Guards), everyone operating a motor vehicle on the installation must produce the following:
       2.1.1.1. A valid DoD, military or base affiliated identification card.
       2.1.1.2. A valid state, provincial, or foreign driver license.
           2.1.1.2.1. The State of California does not recognize an International Driving Permit (IDP) as
           a valid driver license. California does recognize a valid license that is issued by a foreign juris-
           diction (country, state, territory) of which the license holder is a resident (CVC 12502 and
           CVC 12505).
       2.1.1.3. If applicable, an AF Form 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass or computer generated pass in addition
       to a driver license, passport or alien registration card.
       2.1.1.4. Proof of current vehicle registration.
       2.1.1.5. Proof of current vehicle insurance.

2.2. Driver License Requirements.
    2.2.1. All personnel who operate a Government Motor Vehicle (GMV) will comply with the require-
    ments of AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operation, regarding operation of general and special purpose GMVs
    (i.e., 1 ½ ton truck, buses, or any other vehicle over 1 ½ ton); and must be in possession of a valid state
    driver license and AF IMT 2293, US Government Motor Vehicle Identification Card, or computer
    generated GMV driver license. Individuals requesting issuance of AF IMT 2293 or computer gener-
    ated GMV driver license will obtain an AF IMT 171, Request for Driver’s Training and Addition to
    U.S Government Drivers License, from their squadron Vehicle Control Officer (VCO) or Vehicle Con-
    trol Non-Commissioned Officer (VCNCO) and provide it to the 60th Logistics Readiness Squadron,
    Fleet Manager (60 LRS/LGRV).
    2.2.2. Active duty personnel who possess an out-of-state driver license and are stationed at this instal-
    lation, will comply with their respective state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) driver license
    extension/renewal policy (refer to Attachment 3).
    2.2.3. Civilians, to include family members of military personnel, must obtain a California driver
    license within ten days of residence or employment in the State of California. An out-of-state driver
    license is only valid for visitors (CVC 12505).
    2.2.4. Within 30 days of employment or PCS arrival to the installation, active duty and DoD civilian
    employees in possession of a foreign driver license and/or expired California or U.S. driver license
    must renew their driver license with the issuing state’s DMV or obtain a new driver license from a
    California DMV.
TRAVISAFBI31-103 25 FEBRUARY 2008                                                                           7


   2.2.5. Individuals PCSing from this installation to a different state or overseas assignment who are in
   possession of a California driver license receive a renewal extension in accordance with Section
   12817 of the California Vehicle Code (CVC). Licensees must contact a California DMV to update
   their driving record, and the DMV will send the licensee a DL 236 card to carry with the expired Cal-
   ifornia driver license. The DL 236 card states the provisions of CVC Section 12817.

2.3. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
   2.3.1. Title 50 U.S.C., Section 797 grants the Installation Commander the authority to stop, inspect,
   search and impound motor vehicles at installation gates and Air Force Restricted Areas to ensure the
   safety and security of all personnel and resources under their control.
   2.3.2. Reasons for conducting these activities may include, but are not limited to, increased force pro-
   tection conditions, installation entry point checks, random anti-terrorism measures, random vehicle
   inspections and when there is probable cause to search pursuant to alleged criminal activity.
   2.3.3. Installation Entry Point Checks (IEPCs) and Random Vehicle Inspections(RVIs).
       2.3.3.1. IEPCs and RVIs are a random inspection of vehicles directed by the Installation Com-
       mander or designee and are not considered a search. Military and civilian personnel are subject to
       these inspections. IEPCs and RVIs apply to both vehicles and pedestrians entering or exiting the
       installation.
       2.3.3.2. If an individual refuses to submit to inspection of his or her vehicle, then the following
       actions will be completed:
          2.3.3.2.1. If the operator is a civilian, he/she will be asked for identification and advised he/
          she will be denied access to the base until the vehicle has been inspected. If the operator still
          refuses to have the vehicle inspected, the operator/owner will be advised that failing to submit
          to an IEPC or RVI may result in revocation of base driving privileges and/or barment actions.
          If the owner/operator still refuses, he/she will be denied authorization to operate the vehicle
          on-base. Security Forces will conduct a walk around of the vehicle for plain view evidence
          that may be used as a legal foundation for the authority to search and seize. SJA will be con-
          sulted for further guidance.
          2.3.3.2.2. Vehicles under the control of military personnel will be handled in the same man-

     to, cell phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). The wearing of any other portable head-
     phones, earphones or other listening devices (except when using for electronic/voice communica-
     tion) while operating a motor vehicle is prohibited. Use of these devices impairs driving and
     masks or prevents recognition of emergency signals, alarms, announcements, the approach of
     vehicles, and human speech.

        These parking spaces are for official government vehicles used during duty and non-duty
        hours in direct support of the wing mission. An official government vehicle is defined as a
        vehicle owned or leased by the US Government that bears a military or federal government
        issued license plate for the purpose of conducting official business. GOV/GMV spaces are not
        assigned to a particular person or position.

        nated visitor parking. The definition of visitors is those personnel who are not assigned or
        attached to that organization. Visitor parking may have imposed time restrictions (e.g., 15 min-
        utes, 1 hour) and it is assumed that any space marked with a time limit is a visitor parking spot.
        4.8.3.11.4. General Officer Parking. Spaces reserved for any general officer or their spouse,
        and are not assigned to any particular person or position.

        Mobility Wing Commander (60 AMW/CC), 615th Contingency Response Wing Commander
        (615 CRW/CC) and 349th Air Mobility Wing Commander (349 AMW/CC). The spouses of
        these individuals are authorized to park in their respective sponsor’s parking spaces. The wing
        or task force commander may designate reserve parking spaces for key members of their
        immediate staff (e.g., executive officers, Command Chief Master Sergeants, protocol spon-
        sored distinguished visitors).
        4.8.3.11.6. Two-Letter Designation Parking. Spaces assigned to those military or civilian
        equivalent individuals who hold the position of unit commander, who possess a duty symbol

        assigned to a particular person or position or based on personnel strength. The vehicle should
        display the appropriate vehicle decal to park in these spaces, which are first come first served.
        4.8.3.11.8. Group/squadron/detachment commanders isolated from other units on base with
        separate and adequate parking spaces around their building may designate slots to their imme-
        diate staff (e.g. executive officer, manager, and first sergeant). These slots are assigned to a
        position, not a particular person.
        4.8.3.11.9. First Sergeant Parking. Parking for designated unit first sergeants.
        4.8.3.11.10. Decal 1 Parking. Parking for alert aircrew and first responder (e.g., Security
        Forces, Fire Department, ambulance) GOVs/GMVs only.
        4.8.3.11.11. Motorcycle Parking. Public service buildings should provide a zone where sev-
        eral motorcycles can be parked. Public parking areas should also provide this type of parking
        availability. Motorcycles are not permitted to park in diagonal or crosshatched strip areas.
        Reserve signs for motorcycle parking will only be installed for a demonstrated need or if the
        space in question will accommodate motorcycles but not full sized vehicles.
     4.8.3.12. Processing reserved parking requests.
        4.8.3.12.1. Requests for reserved parking are coordinated through the Building Custodian for
        approval/recommendation by the commander. For the purposes of this procedure, the com-
        mander is the unit commander or for facilities occupied by more than one unit, the senior
        officer exercising control over the facility.
        4.8.3.12.2. Unit commanders may approve or disapprove all reserved parking requests for
        their facility in accordance with paragraph 4.8.3.1. The Building Custodian for each facility is

            responsible for maintaining a listing of reserved parking slots. Any proposed changes to a
            facility’s reserved parking plan must be agreed upon by all unit commanders who occupy the
            facility and incorporated into the consolidated parking plan for that facility.
            4.8.3.12.3. Business facilities that do not operate in conjunction with a designated squadron
            (i.e., AAFES, Commissary, Armed Forces Bank and Travis Credit Union) will coordinate all
            reserved parking requests through the Traffic Safety Coordination Group (TSCG) for approval
            under the provisions of paragraph 4.8.3.1. for requesting reserved parking.
            4.8.3.12.4. The Building Custodian will evaluate each request and complete an AF IMT 332,
            Base Civilian Engineer Work Request, if the request is approved by the unit commander. The
            request will indicate the type of work requested, justification with a diagram of the target area
            and a letter of approval from the approving official. This package is forwarded to 60 CES to
            assign a work order number, and forwarded to the TSCG for approval. The TSCG will meet
            quarterly, or as needed, to review all traffic, parking, roadway construction or landscaping
            related AF IMT 332s. The board will approve or disapprove the work orders and will prioritize
            the approved AF IMT 332s. Approved work orders will be sent back to 60 CES for installation
            according to the priority set by the board. Disapproved requests (i.e. exceeds the 20 percent
            limit, creates a traffic hazard etc.) will be returned to the originator by 60 CES. The requestor
            may appeal the board decision by forwarding a letter to the 60 MSG Commander (60 MSG/
            CC) outlining why their reserved parking request should be reconsidered. The appeal will be
            reviewed by the 60 MSG/CC, who will render a final decision.

4.9. Parking Warden Program.
     4.9.1. Reports and Analysis manages the parking warden program. Unit commanders may designate
     First Sergeants and Building Custodians to issue DD Forms 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, for
     parking violations. This designation will be in letter form and maintained by Reports and Analysis.
     Additionally, personnel must attend a training course conducted by Reports and Analysis prior to issu-
     ing any citations.

  in federal service under Title 10 of the United States Code. Title 10 status is reflected on the guards-
  men’s orders. Issue a DD Form 1408 for civilian personnel operating a Government Motor Vehicle
  (GMV) and juvenile traffic offenders. The applicable forms will be forwarded to the appropriate com-
  mander or supervisor for action. Juvenile offenders will be processed through the 60th Air Mobility
  Wing, Staff Judge Advocate (60 AMW/SJA) for referral to civilian juvenile court. Reports and Anal-
  ysis will determine, thru coordination with SJA, on whether the juvenile’s infraction warrants a hear-
  ing in accordance with TAFBI 31-106, Travis Disciplinary Action Program.
  4.10.3. Military/civilian supervisor action. On receipt of the DD Form 1408, Copy 1 - Commanding
  Officer of Violator or Appropriate Civil Agency (white copy), the civilian supervisor, first sergeant or
  commander exercising disciplinary authority over the violator will conduct an inquiry into the inci-
  dent and take appropriate action. The action taken will be annotated on the reverse side of the white
  copy and returned to Reports and Analysis. The action taken will be updated in SFMIS and disposed

     Court, will be notified by mail as to the specific date.
     4.10.5.2. A separate DD Form 1805 will be issued for each offense committed or an AF Form
     3545 will be accomplished in lieu of multiple DD Forms 1805. If an individual has not been given
     a mandatory appearance, but has been assessed a fine on the DD Form 1805, and the individual
     wishes to plead guilty to the charge rather than appear in court, the individual may mail a check or
     money order to: Central Violations Bureau, Post Office Box 740026, Atlanta, GA 30374-0026. All
     such offenses referred to the Federal Magistrate Court will be handled in that system for any crim-
     inal penalties. Referral to the Federal Magistrate Court neither precludes nor requires further
     administrative action based on the traffic offense involved.
     4.10.5.3. Motorists receiving a DD Form 1805 are given the option of forfeiting collateral by pay-
     ing a fine for minor traffic violations or attending court for rebuttal. More serious traffic violations

     istrate orders a bench warrant to be issued for the defendant's arrest after a finding of probable
     cause exists that the offense occurred. The warrant is forwarded to the United States Marshal for
     service upon the defendant. Once the case has been referred to the Magistrate it is out of military
     jurisdiction.
  4.10.6. Violation Appeal Procedures. Any individual receiving a DD Form 1408 who believes they
  have been unfairly or unlawfully cited may contest the validity of the citation.

        recorded on the suspense copy of DD Form 1408 (or supporting statements of the issuing DoD
        Guard or Security Forces member that may be pertinent to the commander's decision).

     receive a traffic complaint involving a parking violation if the vehicle is still illegally parked when the
     patrolman arrives on-scene.
     4.17.2. Personnel requesting to make a traffic complaint regarding a moving violation should attempt
     to identify the vehicle license plate number and issuing state, and the driver’s physical characteristics.
     The complainant should contact Security Forces with this information first, and then proceed to the
     SFCC to complete a written statement. A traffic complaint will not be processed without a written
     statement. This statement serves as the legal basis to lawfully pursue the registered owner and vehicle
     information through the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS). The
     complainant will not be provided with the registered owner’s information, as this is a violation of Cal-
     ifornia Penal Codes 11142 and 13303. Traffic complaints involving parking violations, where the
     driver is still illegally parked when the patrolman arrives on-scene, do not require a statement from the
     complainant.
     4.17.3. Once the registered owner is identified by CLETS and cross-referenced against the base civil-
     ian and military alpha rosters and/or the Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS),
     Security Forces will attempt to locate the registered owner and verify if he/she was operating the vehi-
     cle at the time of the complaint. If the suspected traffic offender is identified, SF will request the driver
     provide a written statement as to whether they committed the traffic offense; and forward the com-
     plainant and driver’s information and statements to the respective first sergeant or DoD civilian super-
     visor for action.

NOTES:
     1. When imposing a suspension or revocation because of an off-installation offense, the effective
        date is the same as the date of civil conviction or the suspension or revocation date of state or
        host nation driving privileges. This effective date can be retroactive.
TRAVISAFBI31-103 25 FEBRUARY 2008                                                                        41


       2. No points are assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions. Except for implied consent
          violations, base revocations on a conviction by a civilian court, military courts-martial, nonju-
          dicial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, or a separate hearing as otherwise addressed
          in this instruction. If revocation for implied consent is combined with another revocation such
          as one year for intoxicated driving, revocations may run consecutively (total of 24 months) or
          concurrently (total of 12 months). Apply the installation commander’s policy systematically
          and not on a case-by-case basis.

5.2. Point System Application. The DD Form 1408, DD Form 1805 and police reports serves as a basis
for determining point assessment. The 60 SFS/CC has delegated personnel assigned to Reports and Anal-
ysis the authority to assess traffic points on all personnel. The number of points assessed will be recorded
on the operator’s installation driving record along with suspensions or revocations.
   5.2.1. In addition to those offenses outlined in AFI 31-204 and AFI 31-218(I), Tables 5.1. and 5.2.,
   the offenses specified in Table 5.2. below will result in point assessments against the violator’s base
   driving record and suspension of base driving privileges when appropriate. Points will be doubled for
   speeding related offenses in housing areas.

                                               Chapter 6

                        IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. General Considerations.
   6.1.1. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment.
      6.1.1.1. As a condition to accepting installation driving privileges, drivers give their consent for
      the removal and temporary impoundment of their Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) or the vehicle
      they are operating if any of the conditions listed in paragraph 6.1.2. are met.
   6.1.2. The basic decision to be made for each potential impoundment is whether impoundment is nec-
   essary and lawful per AFI 31-204, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, AFI 31-218(I), Joint
   Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, and the assimilated provisions of the California Vehicle Code
   (CVC). A POV should not be impounded unless it interferes with traffic, threatens public safety or
   convenience, is involved in criminal activity, contains evidence of criminal activity, or is stolen or
   abandoned. The impoundment of vehicles is inappropriate if other reasonable alternatives exist. When
   possible, attempt to locate the owner of the POV and have the vehicle removed. If reasonably feasible,
   allow another responsible person to drive or tow the POV, if they first have permission from the
   owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle. However in such cases, Security Forces
   is not responsible for safeguarding the vehicle.
   6.1.3. The impounding of a POV is authorized at the direction of 60 AMW/CC, 60 AMW/CV, 60
   MSG/CC, 60 MSG/CD or 60 SFS/CC, or justified when any of the following conditions exist:
      6.1.3.1. The vehicle is illegally parked:
          6.1.3.1.1. On a street or bridge, in a tunnel, or is double parked and interferes with the orderly
          flow of traffic.
          6.1.3.1.2. On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk, on a railroad track, in a fire
          lane, or is blocking a driveway so that the vehicle interferes with operations or creates a safety
          hazard to other roadway users or the general public.
          6.1.3.1.3. In a restricted, controlled or off-limits area to include but not limited to areas cor-
          doned off to implement 25 meter stand-off during increased FPCONS.
          6.1.3.1.4. When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place.
          6.1.3.1.5. In a “tow-away” zone that is so marked with signs.
      6.1.3.2. The vehicle interferes with or is involved in one of the following:
          6.1.3.2.1. Street cleaning or snow removal operations after attempts to contact the owner fail.
          6.1.3.2.2. Emergency operations during a natural disaster, fire, or other emergency.
          6.1.3.2.3. The vehicle was used in a crime or contains evidence of criminal activity.
          6.1.3.2.4. The owner or person in charge of the vehicle is apprehended and therefore unable
          (or unwilling) to arrange removal of the vehicle.
          6.1.3.2.5. The POV is mechanically defective and is a menace to others using the public road-
          ways.
44                                                           TRAVISAFBI31-103 25 FEBRUARY 2008


            6.1.3.2.6. The POV is disabled by a traffic accident and the operator is unavailable or physi-
            cally incapable of having the vehicle towed to a place of safety for storage or safekeeping.
            6.1.3.2.7. The POV displays an expired registration of more than 6 months.
            6.1.3.2.8. The POV threatens public safety or convenience.
            6.1.3.2.9. The POV is stolen or abandoned.
     6.1.4. Vehicles will be impounded using an authorized civilian towing company or the 60th Logistics
     Readiness Squadron, Vehicle Management Flight (60 LRS/LGRV). The decision to place a vehicle
     into a towing company’s storage lot is at the sole discretion of the 60th Security Forces Squadron,
     Security Forces Office of Investigations (60 SFS/S2I); however, all attempts should be made to place
     a military member’s vehicle into the SF Impoundment Lot. Prior to impounding a vehicle, SF will
     conduct an inventory of the vehicle contents.
     6.1.5. Per AFI 31-206 (AMC Sup 1), Security Forces Investigations Program, and the Travis AFB
     Tow Service Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), abandoned vehicles will be removed from the
     installation at no cost to the Air Force by towing companies. Abandoned vehicles and unclaimed
     property will be disposed of by SF Investigations and/or towing companies per Title 10 U.S.C., Sec-
     tion 2575, Disposition of Unclaimed Property, and DoD Manual 4160.21-M, Defense Material Dispo-
     sition Manual, AFI 31-204, AFI 31-218(I), TAFBI 31-104, Lost, Abandoned, or Acquired Property,
     Tow Service MOU, California Vehicle Code and state law.
     6.1.6. S2I and towing companies will conform to the federally mandated unclaimed vehicle and
     unclaimed property retention period of forty-five days. If the required retention period has been met,
     and the owner/lien holder has not made arrangements or fails to reclaim their vehicle or personal prop-
     erty contained in it, S2I or the towing company (depending on who maintained storage and account-
     ability of the vehicle and personal property) will dispose of the vehicle. Additionally, the owner/lien
     holder will be solely responsible for remittance of all tow, storage, and disposal fees they incur.
     6.1.7. The Air Force is not liable for any vehicle damages incurred as the result of being impounded
     by 60 SFS and towed by 60 LRS or a civilian towing company.

6.2. Vehicle Abatement.
     6.2.1. S2I, located in Bldg 380A, has the overall primary responsibility of managing the vehicle
     abatement program and implementing impoundment procedures.
     6.2.2. Security Forces direct the removal of abandoned vehicles and are responsible for contacting the
     towing company. The civilian towing company will recover all costs of towing and storage directly
     from the vehicle owner or other designated representative.
     6.2.3. Impounded vehicles will be transported to the Security Forces Impound Lot, except under the
     following circumstances: the vehicle belongs to a civilian or retiree, there is no space available in the
     Impound Lot, or the vehicle is not registered on base and is being removed pursuant to law enforce-
     ment action. Vehicles not impounded on base will be towed by a civilian wrecker to an authorized tow
     company storage area. To become authorized to tow and store vehicles, a tow company must conform
     with the security measures and other requirements outlined in AFI 31-204, accept the terms in the tow
     company Memorandum of Understanding and agree to indemnify the Air Force in the event a vehicle
     is disposed of prior to the expiration of the mandated retention period.
TRAVISAFBI31-103 25 FEBRUARY 2008                                                                        45


   6.2.4. Towing and storage fees are at the owner’s expense, and is determined by California law and
   the civilian tow company. There is no storage fee for vehicles stored in the Security Forces Impound
   Lot; however the owner will pay the civilian tow company fee before the vehicle is released from
   impoundment.
   6.2.5. The impoundment of a vehicle not involved in criminal activity or stolen is inappropriate when
   other alternatives exist such as the issuance of a warning or citation, or the removal of the vehicle by
   the owner unless deemed necessary for security or mission accomplishment by 60 AMW/CC, 60
   AMW/CV, 60 MSG/CC, 60 MSG/CV or 60 SFS/CC.
   6.2.6. Vehicle operators involved in a traffic stop, who are in violation of this Base Traffic Code and/
   or the assimilated provisions of the California Vehicle Code, should not have their vehicle towed for
   minor vehicle infractions. Security Forces should use reasonable alternatives based on the violation
   such as issue a warning or citation, order the driver not to operate the vehicle, or have an authorized
   driver remove the vehicle from base.
   6.2.7. If necessary and lawful, Security Forces will decide whether immediate towing or immobiliz-
   ing the vehicle with a “boot” is warranted.

6.3. Procedures for Impoundment.
   6.3.1. GM Towing and Roadrunner Towing have signed an MOU with the 60th Security Forces
   Squadron and are the only authorized civilian towing companies eligible to tow vehicles from the
   installation for law enforcement related reasons. These two towing companies will be used on a rota-
   tional basis. The 60 LRS/LGRV may also be contacted to tow vehicles that present traffic, safety or
   fire fighting obstacles.
   6.3.2. Security Forces should make reasonable efforts to identify and contact the owner of the vehicle
   prior to requesting tow authorization from S2I. Reasonable efforts may include conducting a Califor-
   nia Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS) check, attempting to ascertain the loca-
   tion of the owner through Pass and Registration, cross-referencing the military/civilian alpha roster,
   Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS) or Defense Enrollment Eligibility Report-
   ing System (DEERS), going to the residence or contacting the duty section of the vehicle owner.
   6.3.3. If the vehicle owner is determined to be active duty military, cadets/mid-shipmen of the mili-
   tary academies to include the Coast Guard academy, reservist on active duty orders or performing
   inactive duty training including commuting to and from training and guardsmen in federal service
   under Title 10 of the United States Code, Security Forces should contact the unit first sergeant regard-
   ing vehicles determined to be abandoned, illegally parked, or possessing a registration that has been
   expired for more than six (6) months. First sergeants should be afforded the opportunity to locate and
   ascertain the status of the vehicle owner (e.g., leave, deployed), and make arrangements to have the
   vehicle properly parked, registered, or moved off of the installation. If the first sergeant is unable to
   contact the owner within a reasonable amount of time, Security Forces personnel will contact S2I or
   60 SFS Operations (60 SFS/S3) for authorization to have the vehicle impounded. The status of the
   vehicle owner will determine the location the vehicle will be impounded.
   6.3.4. S2I or 60 SFS/S3 authorizes the towing of a vehicle after determining whether impoundment is
   necessary and lawful. Authorized tow companies will be utilized on a rotational basis. SF Controllers
   and S2I will utilize the Tow Company Log book located on the Security Forces Control Center
46                                                             TRAVISAFBI31-103 25 FEBRUARY 2008


     (SFCC) to determine which towing company’s turn it is. S2I will determine whether the vehicle will
     be stored in the SF Impound Lot or towing company’s storage lot.
     6.3.5. Privately owned vehicles belonging to active duty members will be stored in the SF Impound
     Lot if space permits. All others will be stored in the towing company’s storage lot.
        6.3.5.1. Vehicles will remain secured in the vehicle impound lot and the keys to the lot will be
        maintained by S2I and the SFCC. Security Forces patrols will conduct random checks of the exte-
        rior fence of the impound lot to detect signs of unauthorized entry.
     6.3.6. Prior to towing, a Security Forces member and driver of the tow truck will inventory and
     account for valuable items found in the vehicle. The CHP Form 180 (Rev 2-99) OPI 061, Vehicle
     Report, will be utilized in lieu of DD Form 2505, Abandoned Vehicle Removal Authorization and the
     DD Form 2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report. Annotate the contents on the CHP Form 180. As a gen-
     eral rule, the ignition key and personal property found in the vehicle will remain with the towing com-
     pany. If the ignition key or any property is retained, receipt and document reason on an AF Form 52,
     Evidence Tag.
        6.3.6.1. If the vehicle is towed to the SF Impound Lot, Security Forces will inventory and account
        for valuable items found in the vehicle at the time of impoundment. These items will be recorded
        on an AF Form 52, secured in the Evidence and Found Property Room, and disposed of per Title
        10 U.S.C., Section 2575, DoD Manual 4160.21-M and TRAVISAFBI 31-104.
     6.3.7. If the vehicle will be towed off base, Security Forces will remove the DD Form 2220 prior to
     releasing the vehicle to the towing company. Ensure the vehicle decal number is recorded in the SF
     blotter.
     6.3.8. Once the CHP Form 180 has been accomplished and the vehicle has been towed, the SF Con-
     troller or S2I will enter the vehicle into CLETS. If the vehicle was towed for a traffic infraction, it will
     be entered as “stored/towed.” If the vehicle was towed because it was involved in criminal activity,
     contains evidence of criminal activity, or is stolen, it will be entered as “impounded.” A copy of the
     blotter entry and CLETS printout will be forwarded to S2I, and the impoundment will be recorded on
     the AF IMT 1597, Air Force Law Enforcement Terminal System (AFLETS) Documentation, or an
     electronic database version of the AF IMT 1597.

6.4. Abandoned Vehicles.
     6.4.1. Vehicles that appear to be abandoned will be issued a DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle
     Notice.
     6.4.2. Vehicles are considered abandoned when the following conditions exist:
        6.4.2.1. The vehicle has been parked in the same spot for at least three consecutive days.
        6.4.2.2. There are no signs the vehicle has been moved for an extensive period of time.
        6.4.2.3. The vehicle appears to not be roadworthy. Examples of non-moving or non-road worthy
        vehicles include, but are not limited to:
            6.4.2.3.1. Flat tires.
            6.4.2.3.2. Uncovered broken windows.
            6.4.2.3.3. Excessive accumulation of dirt.
TRAVISAFBI31-103 25 FEBRUARY 2008                                                                          47


          6.4.2.3.4. Mechanical or restoration work in progress.
   6.4.3. Once a suspected abandoned vehicle has been identified, the issuing authority (S2I or patrol-
   man) will place a DD Form 2504 on the vehicle with instructions for the owner to contact the SFCC.
   The SF Controller will document the issuance of a DD Form 2504 in the SF Blotter and notify S2I.
   The issuing authority will attempt to identify the registered owner of the vehicle by conducting a
   CLETS check on the vehicle, and cross-referencing the military/civilian alpha rosters, SFMIS and
   DEERS. All appropriate print outs will be stapled to the DD Form 2504 and forwarded to the S2I.
       6.4.3.1. The issuing authority will annotate the reason the vehicle is suspected to be abandoned in
       the “location” block of the DD Form 2504. The issuing authority will conduct a CLETS check of
       the vehicle registration and attach the printout to the DD Form 2504. The second carbon copy of
       the DD Form 2504 will be left on the vehicle, and the original and third carbon copy will be for-
       warded to S2I.
   6.4.4. The vehicle may be towed within three days of notice if the owner does not remove the vehicle
   or does not resolve the issues that led to the issuance of a DD Form 2504.

6.5. Expired Registration.
   6.5.1. Any vehicle with a registration expired over six months may be towed immediately.
   6.5.2. Vehicles with expired registration less than six months may be cited and subsequently evalu-
   ated for signs of abandonment.

6.6. Illegally Parked Vehicles.
   6.6.1. Before towing an illegally parked vehicle, Security Forces will make reasonable attempts to
   contact the owner to have the vehicle removed.
   6.6.2. If the owner cannot be located within a reasonable amount of time or is unable to remove the
   vehicle in a reasonable amount of time, the vehicle may be towed if it is:
       6.6.2.1. Parked on a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk, in a fire lane, or blocking a
       driveway where any of these conditions create a hazard to other traffic or public safety.
       6.6.2.2. Parked blocking an emergency exit at a public place (e.g., base theater, Delta Breeze,
       DGMC) while patrons are occupying the area.
       6.6.2.3. Parked on the roadway interfering with traffic flow.
       6.6.2.4. Left unattended in an off-limits, controlled or restricted area and presents a safety or secu-
       rity hazard or adversely hinders mission requirements.
       6.6.2.5. Parked in a construction area, provided the construction company gave advance notice
       prohibiting parking.
       6.6.2.6. Illegally parked for three (3) consecutive days (requires a written statement by complain-
       ant or firsthand knowledge by Security Forces).
       6.6.2.7. Disabled by accident and the owner is unavailable, unwilling, or physically unable to
       make arrangements for towing the vehicle. Disabled vehicles, as a result of an accident, will be
       towed commercially at the driver's expense. The CHP Form 180 will only be accomplished if the
       towing service requests the form be accomplished.
48                                                           TRAVISAFBI31-103 25 FEBRUARY 2008


6.7. Evidence. Vehicles towed for evidentiary purposes will be taken to the SF Impound Lot after coor-
dination with S2I and entered into CLETS as “impounded.”

6.8. Apprehension/Arrest of Driver. Should it become necessary to impound a vehicle because the
driver was placed under apprehension, prepare a CHP Form 180 and have the vehicle towed to the towing
company’s storage lot if the driver is civilian or retired military, and SF Impound Lot if the driver is active
duty and space permits. Civilian police agencies are responsible for the vehicle’s disposition, arranging
towing and accomplishment of the CHP Form 180 when they arrest civilian offenders on base.

6.9. S2I Responsibilities for Vehicle Impoundment.
     6.9.1. Establish a vehicle case file on the impounded vehicle and update the Impound Vehicle Log.
     Within three days of the impoundment, complete a tow letter and DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle
     Impoundment, and mail the registered owner and/or lien holder the letter and notice via certified mail.
     Document the notification in the Impound Vehicle Log and maintain the PS Form 3811, Domestic
     Return Receipt, in the case file.
        6.9.1.1. All vehicles maintained in the SF Impound Lot, except ones maintained for evidential
        purposes, will be held for a minimum of forty-five (45) days. If the owner or lien holder has not
        made arrangements or fails to reclaim their vehicle or personal property contained in it, and the
        retention period has been met, the vehicle will be released to the original towing company and the
        personal property will be disposed of by S2I through the Abandoned Property Disposal Board
        (APDB) in accordance with Title 10 U.S.C., Section 2575, DoD Manual 4160.21-M and TAFBI
        31-104. The towing company will dispose of the vehicle in accordance with the California Vehicle
        Code and state laws.
        6.9.1.2. All vehicles maintained in a towing company storage lot, except ones maintained for evi-
        dential purposes, will be held for a minimum of forty-five days. If the owner or lien holder has not
        made arrangements or fails to reclaim their vehicle or personal property contained in it, and the
        retention period has been met, the vehicle and personal property are automatically released to the
        towing company for disposition per Title 10 U.S.C., Section 2575, DoD Manual 4160.21-M, Cal-
        ifornia Vehicle Code and state laws.
     6.9.2. If the owner contacts S2I within forty-five days and requests to reclaim their vehicle, the owner
     must pay the required towing and storage fees.
     6.9.3. The owner must also show proof of a valid driver license, current registration, and motor vehi-
     cle insurance before the vehicle will be released.
     6.9.4. The owner will sign the CHP Form 180 and be provided with a copy of the form to retrieve the
     vehicle from the towing company’s storage lot. S2I will sign the release authorization on the CHP
     Form 180 which informs the towing company the owner has met all requirements to retrieve their
     vehicle. If the vehicle is stored in the SF Impound Lot the owner must provide a receipt from the tow
     company for the tow fee before the vehicle can be released. Towing and storage fees are the sole
     responsibility of the owner. The towing and storage rates are the private right of the towing company
     and are not dictated or controlled by the Air Force.
     6.9.5. Once the vehicle has been released to the owner, lien holder, or towing company if unclaimed,
     S2I will forward the vehicle case file to Reports and Analysis. The vehicle case file should include the
     following:
TRAVISAFBI31-103 25 FEBRUARY 2008                                                                49
