This instruction establishes responsibilities and procedures for hosting distinguished visitors

the Wing DV Greeter Program. It applies to all 6 AMW units at MacDill Air Force Base (AFB).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises the accessibility and releasability statements. A margin bar (|)
indicates new or revised material since the previous edition.
1. Explanation of DV. Any visitor who is:
   1.1. A General/Flag officer or civilian equivalent: DV-6 through DV-1. (A copy of the DV
   code chart is at Attachment 1. To convert DV codes to equivalent general/flag officer rank,
   subtract the DV code from the base number of 7, e.g., 7 – (DV) 6 = 1- star; 7 – (DV) 3 = 4 –
   star.)
   1.2. Any person determined by the Commander (6 AMW/CC) to be of special interest or
   importance regardless of rank/grade. When DVs visit MacDill AFB in conjunction with
   anticipated 6 AMW/CC involvement, project officers will treat them according to this
   directive.
2. General.
   2.1. It is the policy of the 6 AMW/CC that every DV arriving and departing MacDill AFB
   via military airlift will be greeted at the flightline by a wing representative. See paragraph 5
   for further information on the MacDill AFB DV greeter program.
 2                                                      MACDILLAFBI35-200 8 MARCH 2001


     2.2. Contact Wing Protocol (6 AMW/CCP) to discuss appropriate mementos, welcome
     basket, and uniform for the visit.
3. 6 AMW/CCP will:
     3.1. Review itineraries associated with DV visits. A sample itinerary is included at
     Attachment 2.
     3.2. Advise project officers of DV administrative procedures and assist as necessary.
     3.3. Advise wing agencies regarding protocol matters.
     3.4. Control lodging reservations for DV quarters at MacDill Inn.
     3.5. Publish a daily military air DV arrival/departure schedule for 6 AMW/CC and DV
     greeters.
     3.6. Publish a DV greeter schedule.
     3.7. Provide Wing Admin the projected DV visits at MacDill AFB for the weekly Wing
     Staff Meeting.
     3.8. Oversee housekeeping and upkeep of DV Lounge at Hangar 3.
     3.9. Input DV names on flightline welcome marquee.
     3.10. Sign out STU III keys to project officers.
     ALL WING AGENCIES: Upon notification of or request for a visit to MacDill AFB, the
     functional agency receiving the first contact will prepare an AF Form 1768, Staff Summary
     Sheet, to obtain 6 AMW/CC approval for the projected visit. Include 6 AMW/CCP as a
     coordinating office on the AF Form 1768.
4. Offices of Primary Responsibility (OPR)/Project Officers: The Group Commander whose
area is the functional focus of a visit is the OPR. The OPR will appoint a project officer from
within his/her group to work the details for the visit. Normally, 6 AMW/CCP and/or the Wing
Executive Officer (6 AMW/CCE) will be the OPR for visits by 21 AF/CC/CV and HQ
AMC/CC/CV and other higher headquarters visitors who are here specifically to meet with the
Wing Commander. Using the visit checklist at Attachment 3 as a guide, the project officer will:
     4.1. Ensure 6 AMW/CC approval has been obtained.
     4.2. Contact the visitor’s office and request the DV’s specific area of interest and details
     surrounding visit; i.e., dates, arrival/departure times, mode of transportation, number in party,
     lodging and transportation requirements, dietary restrictions, etc.
     4.3. Reserve conference rooms and other facilities to support the visit. Arrange for
     audiovisual equipment, seating plans, conference room name plates, pens, writing pads,
     briefing dry runs, security, refreshments, etc. If a meeting involves the 6 AMW/CC or Vice
     Commander (6 AMW/CV) and it is held in the Wing Conference Room, 6 AMW/ CCP will
     set up the room with name plates and refreshments. The project officer must provide 6
     AMW/CCP with the correct information on attendees.
     4.4. Arrange for lodging. Project officers should contact 6 AMW/CCP 8-2056 to arrange
     lodging in DV quarters for general officers, colonels and civilian equivalents (e.g., Senior
     Executive Service, GS-15 and above), and E-9s. Reservations for other members of the
MACDILLAFBI35-200 8 MARCH 2001                                                                    3


  traveling party below the above grades will be made through the MacDill Inn reservation
  section (8-4259). Complete name, social security number, organizational address, purpose of
  visit, and length of stay are required. If names and exact number of visitors are unknown
  during early planning stages, provide an estimate number of rooms required and update as
  planning progresses.
  4.5. Arrange for officer of appropriate rank to meet and depart the ranking guest.
     4.5.1. Arrival via military air: 6 AMW/CCP will include the arrival on the daily
     Transient DV Airlift sheet with a suggested greeter (either the Wing CC, CV or duty
     greeter). The visit OPR (group commander) will also meet the aircraft and the project
     officer will be in place to oversee arrangements made for the visit.
     4.5.2. Arrival via commercial air: OPR/project officers will arrange for an appropriate
     escort to meet DVs arriving at Tampa International Airport. A general officer would
     normally be met by an O-6. If the DV prefers to rent a car and travel to the base on
     his/her own; work with the DV’s office to make arrangements for meeting at the base.
  4.6. Arrange ground transportation. To obtain staff car, DV van, etc., for visits involving
  general officers, contact the 6 AMW/CCP who will request the appropriate vehicle(s) for the
  visit through the 6th Transportation Squadron protocol support. If a driver is requested to
  support the visit, a transportation plan with a complete itinerary is required. Normally, the
  OPR/project officer will drive the DV.
  4.7. Coordinate reserved parking. Determine where reserved parking will be needed and
  contact 6 AMW/CCP with the name of the visitor(s) and the number of parking signs
  required. Project officers will pick up and return the signs to 6 AMW/CCP.
  4.8. Advise 6 AMW/CCP if there is a function where the DV will be the host or guest
  speaker. CCP will determine if a personal flag is available and appropriate to post.
  4.9. Coordinate baggage handling and transportation between flightline and lodging.
  4.10. Schedule meetings with the Wing Commander through the 6 AMW/CC’s secretary or
  executive officer (8-4444). Coordinate attendance of all interested staff agencies for briefings
  and tours and provide names of attendees to 6 AMW/CCE and CCP.
  4.11. Provide an initial itinerary within 1 week of visit notification and all subsequent
  updates to the Wing Command Section and 6 AMW/CCP. The final itinerary must be
  submitted at least 2 days prior to the visit. The itinerary will include all pertinent information
  including arrangements for transportation, lodging, meals, and uniform requirements. When
  the itinerary has been approved at the appropriate level (Group Commander and/or Wing
  Commander), forward it to the DV’s office for their approval.
  4.12. Pre-registration at MacDill Inn. The day of the visit, pre-register the DV at the lodging
  office and provide room keys to the visitor upon arrival. Check-in time is 1400 and check-out
  time is 1100. If early check-in or late check-out is requested, coordinate with 6 AMW/CCP
  as soon as the requirement is known to determine if the request can be accommodated.
  4.13. Miscellaneous. 6 AMW/CCP will assist project officers, as needed, to include seating
  plans, name tags, advice on meals, function set-up requirements, etc. If the Wing
  Commander or Wing Vice Commander hosts a meal or social function, 6 AMW/CCP will
  coordinate the arrangements.

5. DV Greeter Program. The program is designed to ensure general/flag officers and
equivalent civilians receive a proper greeting and courtesies when arriving/departing MacDill
AFB via military air and to provide assistance as necessary. The duty period begins at 0700 on
Monday and ends at 0700 the following Monday.
     5.1. O-6s assigned to the 6 AMW will be scheduled by 6 AMW/CCP for DV greeter duty in
     one-week increments. The duty greeter will be available to meet all arriving and departing
     DVs.
     5.2. The Wing Commander or Wing Vice Commander will normally meet 3- and 4-star
     visitors, depending on their schedules. The duty greeter will meet all other visiting
     general/flag officers unless advised otherwise.
     5.3. 6 AMW/CCP will:
        5.3.1. Develop a 2- to 3-month DV Greeter schedule based on projected leave and TDY
        of duty greeters.
        5.3.2. Publish a daily Transient DV Airlift schedule and send it via e-mail to all pertinent
        agencies.
        5.3.3. With prior notice of a DV arrival, coordinate any special arrangements that are
        requested, such as meals, billeting, and transportation.
     5.4. The duty greeter will:
        5.4.1. Meet arriving and departing DV flights. Most DVs at MacDill will be hosted by
        the Wing, US Central Command, or US Special Operations Command, and a senior
        representative from the hosting organization will be on scene as well as all required
        transportation and support elements.
        5.4.2. If a DV arrives at MacDill and has no host organization, usually a refueling stop,
        escort the visitor to the DV lounge and provide other assistance as required (e.g.,
        transportation, billeting, meals), if prior arrangements have not been made.
6. Notification of Arriving Aircraft: Base Operations will notify the Wing Command Post and
6 AMW/CCP when a DV’s aircraft is 30 minutes out and again when the aircraft is 20 miles out.
The Command Post will notify the Wing Commander and/or the DV greeter with the same
information.
7. Reporting. 6 AMW/CCP submits a weekly DV report to 21 AF/CCEA who compiles all
wing reports and forwards the information to HQ AMC/CCP. Last-minute DV visits are reported
as soon as notification is received.
