Terms
Emitter/Simulatorâ€”Generic terms used to describe threat equipment operated at Electronic
Combat Ranges (ECR) and Electronic Scoring Sites (ESS). However, ACC operates a variety of
equipment including, but not limited to: Emitter only systems, Emitter-Receiver-Processors, and
replica type systems. Carefully compare the similarities and features of different systems and
consider operational requirements. Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) and Anti-Aircraft Artillery
(AAA) simulators include all manned and unmanned threat emitters.
Government Controlledâ€”Control exercised by any agency of the federal government, not just
USAF or DoD.
Major Command (MAJCOM)â€”A major subdivision of USAF assigned a major part of the Air
Force mission. Major commands report directly to Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ
USAF). The ANGRC/DO serves as the MAJCOM for Air National Guard ranges.
Military Operations Area (MOA)â€”Special Use Airspace allocated to the military to
separate/segregate certain military activities from Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) traffic, and to
identify the location of these military activities to Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic. VFR aircraft
are not restricted from transiting MOAs.
Military Training Route (MTR)â€”A low-level, high-speed training route established IAW
criteria in FAA Handbook 7610.4, Special Military Operations. MTRs are used by DoD to
conduct low altitude navigation and tactical training, in instrument and visual weather
conditions, below an altitude of 10,000 feet MSL and at airspeeds more than 250 KIAS. Routes
are established as IFR routes (IR) or VFR routes (VR). The FAA has approval authority to
