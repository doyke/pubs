1. Introduction:
   1.1. Purpose. This instruction provides uniform policy, instruction, and guidance for the
   management of all radiation-producing sources at JBER. It sets forth how joint base
   personnel and units provide all programs associated with the safe usage of radioactive
   materials, ionizing-radiation producing devices, lasers, and radiofrequency emitters. This
   instruction also prescribes how tenant units and non-JBER entities get approval to use
   radiation-producing sources on JBER.
   1.2. Safety Statement. All exposures to radiation will be as low as reasonably achievable
   (ALARA) consistent with existing technology, cost, and operational requirements. Each
   person involved in radiological operations on JBER must use all reasonable means available
   (that is, time, distance, and shielding) to minimize personnel radiation exposure from all
   ionizing radiation sources. In order to implement the ALARA concept, each agency,
   organization, contractor and individual who uses or handles radiation-producing sources
   must make a concerted effort to ensure operations and maintenance procedures result in safe
   workplaces and minimized radiation exposure.

        notify the IRSO when items are received, transferred or disposed of.
        3.1.2. Generally licensed RAM is defined in AFI 40-201, Attachment 3. Items in this
        category do not require a broad scope AF license. Instead, a general license is issued
        upon receipt of the device. The license is typically provided by the device manufacturer
        or in the case of device transfer, by the prior owner. If a device is labeled as generally
        licensed, but a license document is not available, it can be obtained by contacting the
        manufacturer or the IRSO. This license will outline leak test and surveillance
        requirements for the item. In addition to testing requirements, the owning organization
        must assign an URSO, maintain an inventory of all items, verify the inventory annually,
        provide a copy of the inventory to the IRSO annually, and notify the IRSO when items
        are received, transferred or disposed of.

          middle), rank or civil service rating.
   10.3. Laser Radiation Hazard Evaluations:
      10.3.1. A hazard evaluation must be accomplished and all required engineering and
      administrative controls must be in place prior to commencement of operations or
      maintenance for all readily accessible (non-interlocked, non-embedded, or both) laser
      systems of Class 3b, 4 and any Class 3a laser that exceeds 5 mW average power (i.e. any
      laser that requires the Danger sign). All military unique laser systems must have a hazard
      evaluation (that is, GCP-1, GCP-2, MILES, and Saber 203). Ensure that the laser is
      properly labeled with the appropriate classification. Examples of systems NOT requiring
      a hazard evaluation include laser printers containing an embedded interlocked Class 4
      laser. Bioenvironmental Engineering, accompanied by the LSO, will conduct an
      inspection of the operation to ensure all safety procedures are in place, as prescribed in
      AFOSHSTD 48-139 (for Air Force systems) and DA PAM 385-24 (for Army Systems).
      10.3.2. If there are any changes to the operational parameters, the usage location, or the

      immediately report to the emergency room for evaluation. The system involved in the
      suspected overexposure should be powered down, but all other settings should be left
      alone to facilitate the incident investigation. If the system involved is mobile (for
      example, aircraft, vehicle, and so forth), it should remain in the location where the
      incident occurred, as long as safety is not compromised. The supervisor of exposed
      personnel must notify the unit LSO and Bioenvironmental Engineering immediately so
      that required interviews and system measurements can take place as soon as practical.
11. Radiofrequency Emitter Operations:
   11.1. Each unit that possesses radiofrequency emitters must contact Bioenvironmental
   Engineering for an initial evaluation. Bioenvironmental Engineering will assign a risk rating
   (low, medium, or high) based on the emitter’s hazard potential.
      11.1.1. If an emitter is assigned a low risk rating, limited further action is required.
      Bioenvironmental Engineering will maintain an inventory of these emitters and unit
      supervisors will provide updates to that inventory, as appropriate. Additionally, unit
      supervisors will provide RF safety awareness training to personnel utilizing the emitters.
      11.1.2. If an emitter is assigned a medium or high risk, the following actions are
      required:
          11.1.2.1. The unit appoints an URSO.
          11.1.2.2. The URSO develops an OI for RF Safety.
673ABWI48-103 23 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                 17


          11.1.2.3. The URSO develops and provides initial and annual training on the hazards
          and safety procedures associated with the unit’s RF emitters. Training must be
          documented on the AF Form 55 or Army equivalent.
          11.1.2.4. Bioenvironmental Engineering will conduct an extensive survey of the
          emitter and document this on AF Form 2759, Radio Frequency Radiation Emitter
          Survey. If a potential for electro-explosive hazard is present, Bioenvironmental
          Engineering will contact Safety for an evaluation of this hazard.
          11.1.2.5. The URSO will maintain an inventory of all emitters. Any changes to the
          inventory will be coordinated with Bioenvironmental Engineering.
          11.1.2.6. If there any changes to the operational parameters, the usage location, or the
          safety procedures associated with an emitter, the URSO will immediately notify
          Bioenvironmental Engineering. If needed, Bioenvironmental Engineering will
          schedule a new survey.
      11.1.3. Bioenvironmental Engineering will assign a routine surveillance frequency for
      emitters based upon hazard potential. If possible, routine surveillance will be conducted
      during periodic industrial hygiene surveys.
   11.2. In case of a suspected overexposure to radio frequency (RF) radiation, all personnel
   involved will immediately report to the emergency room for evaluation. The system
   involved in the suspected overexposure should be powered down, but all other settings
   should be left alone to facilitate the incident investigation. If the system involved is mobile
   (for example, aircraft, vehicle, and so forth), it should remain in the location where the
   incident occurred, as long as safety is not compromised. The supervisor of exposed
   personnel must notify Bioenvironmental Engineering immediately so that required interviews
   and system measurements can take place as soon as practical.
12. Training:
   12.1. Personnel who use RAM/RPD, lasers, and/or RF emitters require initial and annual
   radiation safety training.
   12.2. The workplace supervisor is responsible for ensuring training is conducted. Although
   many personnel receive training in technical school, it must be supplemented with worksite
   specific procedures. Training documentation shall be maintained by the supervisor.
13. Incidents and Accidents:
   13.1. If a spill, fire, explosion or injury involving RAM/RPD occurs, immediately notify
   emergency services. Specify that RAM is involved to ensure that all other appropriate
   agencies respond. Shut down all ancillary operations and evacuate the area. Account for all
   personnel. Do not allow personnel to leave the assembly area until cleared by the IRSO.
   Give a full description of what happened, including circumstances, amount and type of
   isotope, number of personnel involved, where the incident occurred, and an estimate of the
   extent of contamination to emergency responders and follow-on personnel.
      13.1.1. In situations where radioactive materials are in use and the situation allows,
      personnel should quickly place the materials into appropriate storage containers and
      transport them away from the affected area.
 18                                                    673ABWI48-103 23 FEBRUARY 2012


       13.1.2. Fire fighting must be accomplished in such a manner that exposure of personnel
       to radiation is held to a minimum and the spread of radioactive contamination is avoided.
       13.1.3. As a general rule, when using fire hoses, water fog is preferable to solid stream
       application to avoid excessive runoff of water that may spread contamination.
       13.1.4. Firefighters must wear protective clothing and respiratory equipment even though
       there is no evidence of immediate radiation danger. If possible, fire fighting should be
       conducted from the upwind side of the blaze.
   13.2. A person who ingests or inhales radioactive material should be removed to an
   uncontaminated area immediately and transported for medical treatment as soon as it is safe
   to do so. Bioenvironmental Engineering should be notified of the incident immediately by
   the person’s unit.
   13.3. A person who has been exposed to ionizing radiation above allowable levels, either
   from RAM or X-ray sources, should seek immediate medical attention. The source of the
   exposure should be contained and any equipment involved should be shut off, but the area
   should be undisturbed to facilitate re-creation of the event. Bioenvironmental Engineering
   should be notified of the incident immediately by the person’s unit.
   13.4. Depending on the incident, notification of off-base entities may be required as outlined
   in AFI 40-201, Attachment 11, Reporting Criteria. All off-base communications will be
   coordinated with the 673 ABW/CC.
   13.5. Within 20 days from the date of the incident, the IRSO and Safety must receive a
   complete written report from the URSO with a detailed description of the incident, a
   chronological description of how the incident was handled, and preventive measures taken to
   ensure the incident will not be repeated.
14. Records:
   14.1. For radioactive material permits, the PRSO and Bioenvironmental Engineering will
   maintain records as required by the CFR Title 10, DA PAM 385-24 and AFI 33-364, Records
   Disposition-Procedures and Responsibilities.
   14.2. For non-permitted radioactive materials and radiation producing devices, the URSO
   and 673 AMDS/SGPB will maintain surveys, inventories, investigations, and disposition
   records.
   14.3. For lasers and RF emitters, the URSO and Bioenvironmental Engineering will
   maintain inspections, investigations, surveys and inventories.
   14.4. Personnel exposure records will be kept on AF Form 1527-1, Annual Report of
   Individual Occupational Exposure to Ionizing Radiation or Army equivalent, and maintained
   in the Bioenvironmental Engineering Office and individual’s personal medical record.
15. Information Collections. No information collections are required by this publication.

Terms
91(a) Material— RAM exempted from NRC licensing controls under Section 91(a) of the AEA
of 1954, as amended, in the interest of national defense, under the possession of the DOE.
91(b) Material— RAM exempted from NRC licensing controls under Section 91(b) of the AEA
of 1954, as amended, in the interest of national defense, under the possession of the DOD. These
include materials in nuclear weapons.
As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA)— The principle that personnel exposures must
be maintained as low as possible consistent with existing technology, cost, and operational
requirements.
Emitter— Any device which is designed to generate RF energy and couple this energy into the
surrounding space.
Frequency— The number of cycles completed by an electromagnetic wave in one second, given
in cycles and (or) second or hertz.
Ionizing Radiation— Any electromagnetic or particulate radiation capable of producing ions
directly or indirectly in its passage through matter. Examples are X-rays and gamma rays.
License— Written authorization from the NRC or an Agreement State to acquire, receive, use,
store or transfer byproduct, source, or SNM. Licenses will be either (1) General License
published in NRC or Agreement State Regulations, that is effective without any need to send an
application to, or that is effective to any applicant on registration with, the NRC or an Agreement
State or (2) Specific License issued by the NRC or Agreement State to a named applicant who
has filed an application authorizing acquisition, ownership, receipt, storage, use, transfer, and
disposal of chemical or physical forms of radioisotopes specified in the license. This license has
an expiration date renewable on application to the issuing authority. The license may be limited
in scope (authorizing only certain specific radioisotopes for limited users) or broad (authorizing
the use of a wide variety of radioisotopes without regard to form, quantity, or use).
Nonionizing Radiation—Any electromagnetic radiation incapable of producing ions directly or
indirectly. Microwaves and RF energy are forms of nonionizing radiation.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission— An agency established by Title II of the Energy
Reorganization Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-438) to regulate byproduct, source, and Special
Nuclear Material (SNM) as provided for by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
Within the NRC, final authority rests with the five member Commission acting as a body.
Permit— Shortened term for USAF or USN RAM Permit. See USAF RAM Permit.
Radiation Safety Officer— An individual with specific education, military training, and
professional experience in radiation protection practice appointed by a Permittee or the USAF
Radioisotope Committee to manage radiation safety programs. The term "Radiation Safety
Officer" is a functional title and does not denote a commissioned status or specialty code. The
RSO must have the education, military training, and professional experience needed for the job.
Take care when addressing RSO qualifications and duties to distinguish between IRSO and
PRSOs. Individuals appointed as the IRSO might not always have the specific technical
experience and training needed to qualify as the PRSO.

Radioactive Item— A single unit or article constructed of or having RAM, greater than exempt
quantities, as a component part.
Radioactive Material (RAM)— Materials whose nuclei, because of their unstable nature, decay
by emission of ionizing radiation. The radiation emitted may be alpha particles, beta particles,
gamma rays, X-rays, or neutrons.
USAF Radioactive Material Permit— Written authorization from the USAF Radioisotope
Committee for USAF organizations to receive, possess, use, distribute, store, transport, transfer
and dispose of RAM. Permits parallel NRC licenses in applications and scope. The USAF’s
Master Materials License, and Broad Scope licensees, issue permits which are equivalent to
NRC licenses for authorizing NRC regulated material. Unlike the NRC, a single permit may
authorize byproduct, source, SNM, and Naturally Occurring or Accelerator Produced
Radioactive Material (NARM).
USAF Radioisotope Committee (RIC)— A committee established in accordance with
requirements of the USAF Master Materials License to coordinate the administrative and
regulatory aspects of permitting, acquiring,, receiving, possessing, using, distributing, storing,
transporting, transferring and disposing of all RAM in the USAF, except that material transferred
from the Department of Energy to the Department of Defense in nuclear weapon systems, certain
radioactive parts of weapons systems and nuclear reactor systems, parts and fuel controlled under
Section 91(a) or 91(b) of the AEA. It is composed of stake-holder representatives from Staff Air
Force and Headquarters Air Force.
