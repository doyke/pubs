1. Functions: The Patrick AFB Honor Guard is an elite team comprised of members from the
45th Space Wing and tenant units. It serves the largest population of military retirees in Air
Force Space Command and is one of the busiest in the Air Force. The team supports the
Southeastern Florida region extending from Volusia County down to Miami Dade County. In
some cases the region extends south to Key West. This area consists of over 1 million active
duty, retired and veteran personnel.
     1.1. Historically, the honor guard supports over 800+ requests annually to include:
        1.1.1. Military funerals and memorial services. For procedural guidelines, reference the
        USAF Honor Guard training manual and guide.
        1.1.2. Change of command ceremonies (See AFMAN 36-2203, Drill and Ceremonies, 3
        June 2006).

       1.1.3. Civilian programs, parades and celebrations (See AFPD 35-2, Public
       Communication Programs).
   1.2. Appropriate military honors at funerals or memorial services and ceremonies when
   requested by the Installation Commander, Base Mortuary Officer, Person Authorized Direct
   Disposition (PADD) or the Next Of Kin (NOK) of a deceased military member:
       1.2.1. USAF Active Duty or USAF Medal of Honor recipients, within the jurisdiction of
       Patrick AFB, as specified by the Military Honors Assignment by County Documents,
       issued by HQ Air Force Mortuary Services. (https:www-r.afsv.af.mil/default.asp).
       1.2.2. Deceased USAF retired and veteran personnel within the county area will receive
       the authorized military honors.
       1.2.3. Provide honors as authorized by the AFIs listed in attachment 1.
       1.2.4. NOK of deceased personnel of sister services, where practical, will be referred to
       the nearest military activity of the same service as the deceased.
       1.2.5. Florida state law prohibits burial on legal holidays. However, memorial services
       and other ceremonies requiring honor guard participation may be scheduled for any day
       of the week or year.
   1.3. Priority of details:
       1.3.1. Funerals will be top priority for the honor guard under the guidance provided
       within paragraph 1.2. In the case of dual funerals where the on duty flight needs more
       personnel, the on call flight will be tasked first. However, members from all flights may
       be tasked when needed.
       1.3.2. The mortuary affairs office (45 FSS/FSOXU) will attempt to reschedule any
       overlapping funerals in coordination with the funeral home, the PADD/NOK and the
       honor guard superintendent or designee.
       1.3.3. Other honor guard details will be based on the following priority: Colors for
       change of command for 45 SW/CC, cordons for dignitaries, Colors for wing-level events,
       assistance for retreats during military holidays (when requested by the wing CC), Colors
       for other special events for the base, Colors for retirements on base (E-9 and O-6 and
       above), Colors for special community events within a twenty-mile radius of Patrick AFB,
       Colors for local military events, Colors for local non-military events outside the twenty-
       mile radius of Patrick AFB.
       1.3.4. All other requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis by 45 FSS/FSOXU.
       The decision will be based on input from the on-duty Flight Commander or on-duty flight
       NCOIC with reference to the current schedule, honor guard manning, location of event,
       type of event and requester.
       1.3.5. The mortuary affairs officer or the honor guard superintendent will refer detail
       request customers to the local Naval Honor Guard and ROTC Color Guards when the
       Patrick AFB Honor Guard cannot perform requested details.
2. Manning and Obligations: The Patrick AFB Honor Guard will be manned with personnel
(E-1 through E-7 and O-1 through O-3) selected from units on base. Selection will be based on
unit strength versus base population provided by 45 FSS/CC and approved by 45 SW/CC.
