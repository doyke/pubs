                                            Chapter 1

                       LOGISTICS READINESS RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Logistics Readiness. Logistics Readiness within AMC is handled through two separate
and distinct functional organizations. The Logistics Readiness Division, 618th Air and Space
Operations Center 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCL, is AMC’s logistics command and control (C2)
component within the 618th AOC and is the focal point for all aircraft logistics matters affecting
current operations in execution within the AMC C2 system. The Logistics Operations Division
(HQ AMC/A4O) comprises three separate and distinct functional branches: Logistics Readiness
Management (A4OL), Logistics Operations Management (A4OC) and Maintenance Readiness
Management (A4OM) which includes the En Route Support Section each of these divisions
work in unison with the Director of Operations (HQ AMC/A3) and 618 AOC (TACC) mission
managers.
     1.1.1. HQ AMC/A4O is the A4 point of contact for AMC logistics mission support for
     contingency plans (OPLANs and CONPLANs), exercises, President of the United States
     (POTUS) support and theater augmentation. HQ AMC/A4O will determine logistics
     support requirements, then source, task, and manage deployed personnel, equipment, and
     supplies. A4O support planners will deploy mobility readiness spares package (MRSP)
     resources as required; perform logistics execution planning and task use of pre-positioned
     command MRSP assets, mission support equipment, general purpose vehicles and other
     resources in support of the above missions. A4O is authorized to verbally task AMC and
     mobilized/activated AMC-gained logistics personnel and support equipment.
        1.1.1.1. A4O aerial port planners manage rotational Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) and
        Eagle Flag requirements. All other aerial port requirements are managed by 618 AOC
        (TACC)/XOPM.
            1.1.1.1.1. A4O is not responsible for establishing or assessing home station
            requirements. Wings will submit home station manning assistance requirements to
            the appropriate functional manager within HQ AMC/A4 (i.e., A4M is the functional
            manager for aircraft maintenance). The functional manager will then validate and
            source the requirement.
            1.1.1.1.2. If the requirement for manning assistance is due to contingency operations,
            the functional manager will coordinate with A4O and 618 AOC (TACC) future ops
            for additional information in order to validate the requirement.
        1.1.1.2. A4O support planners develop requirements and task units for unit type codes
        (UTC) to logistically support all AMC missions at their forward operating locations
        (FOL). A4O support planners are available to assist deployed members at the FOL. The
        senior member of the deployed teams needs to contact A4O before deploying, upon
        arrival, and en route if they encounter any problems. The contact numbers are DSN 779-
        2412 or commercial 618-229-2412 or 800-AIR-MOBL x2412.
            1.1.1.2.1. Once a wing receives a tasking, follow the guidance in AFI 10-403,
            Deployment Planning and Execution, in order to shortfall a requirement. A4O has
            final approval/disapproval authority on all active duty shortfalls.
AMCI21-108 16 DECEMBER 2011                                                                     5


         1.1.1.2.2. All communications between A4O and the wings regarding logistics issues
         goes through the wing LGRRP. This prevents confusion and delays. If squadron
         UDMs have questions for A4O, they need to route them through their LGRRP.
  1.1.2. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCL is a 24-hour, 7-day a week operation that provides
  expeditious logistics support by initiating and controlling recovery actions for AMC, AMC-
  gained, and operational support airlift (OSA) aircraft on AMC missions that are not mission
  capable (NMC) or have reported mission essential (ME) discrepancies away from home
  station. XOCL supports aircraft recovery by expediting the movement of Maintenance
  Recovery Teams (MRT), parts, and equipment (as applicable) through the transportation
  system to support NMC aircraft off station. XOCL has the authority to direct, control, and
  task subordinate units for personnel, parts, and equipment as well as coordinating
  transportation requirements. AMCI 10-403, AIR MOBILITY COMMAND (AMC) FORCE
  DEPLOYMENT, authorizes XOCL to verbally task units to expedite aircraft recovery.
  1.1.2.1. If requested, XOCL will also coordinate support for AMC, ANG and AFRC NMC
  aircraft not executing AMC missions by communicating with the aircraft’s home station, for
  example: Off-station trainers (OST), training missions, Guardlift, etc. It is the responsibility
  of the aircrew to first contact their home station to coordinate recovery efforts as any
  recovery effort handled by XOCL will be supported by a unit fund cite. If home station is
  unable to support the effort or requires assistance, XOCL will fully support the recovery once
  a unit fund cite is provided, to include tasking AD units, with JCS priority consideration
  driving recovery priorities.
         1.1.2.1.1. NMC C-5s and C-17s, both active and Air Reserve Component (ARC),
         visiting AMC OCONUS en route sites with Forward Supply Locations (FSLs) will be
         provided the full range of 435 SCOG/GWJ & XOCL support. This support will be
         provided regardless of whether these aircraft are executing AMC missions or not.
         The FSL will issue parts on-hand down to zero balance and will backorder for 1A
         conditions validated by authorized mission capability (MICAP) approval authorities.
         Even if the part is eventually sourced from the aircraft’s home station, the backorder
         will be recorded and reparable spare turned-in at the FSL. C-5 and C-17 wings have
         previously established customer organization accounts at these locations, so no new
         fund cites for parts will be required.
     1.1.2.2. XOCL will support CONUS-operating AMC Operational Support Aircraft
     (OSA)/Contractor Support Aircraft (CLS) when assistance is requested from the
     contractor or owning home station. Normally XOCL assistance is limited to arranging
     transportation for military recovery resources. XOCL is not responsible for preparing
     appropriate contractor MRT orders.
     1.1.2.3. The 89 AW and 375 AW perform all recovery actions for aircraft assigned to
     their units. XOCL will assist in recovery efforts of these aircraft if assistance is
     requested.
         1.1.2.3.1. Andrews AFB contract maintenance is not tasked by XOCL for MRTs.
         The MRT responsibility resides with the contractor.
         1.1.2.3.2. Any contracted parts requirements from Andrews AFB are shipped
         commercially.
6                                                       AMCI21-108 16 DECEMBER 2011


    1.1.2.4. The Aircraft Commander, Flying Crew Chief (FCC), or, if at AMC en route
    locations, the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), is responsible for ensuring XOCL
    is notified of aircraft status. XOCL will coordinate recovery assistance requests for ARC
    aircraft through the affected home station and National Guard Bureau (NGB/A3XX).
    1.1.2.5. XOCL is the focal point for Crash Damage or Disabled Aircraft Recovery
    (CDDAR) of AMC assets where en route capability is limited or does not exist. XOCL
    will coordinate with weapon system functional managers to determine MRT composition
    and equipment requirements, and task applicable units to provide the necessary assets.
    For OCONUS post accident investigation wreckage recovery responsibilities, refer to
    Attachment 3, AMC OCONUS Post Accident Investigation Wreckage Recovery
    Checklist.
    1.1.2.6. XOCL will provide/coordinate maintenance advice to en route aircrews when
    requested using applicable technical orders and policy guidance. XOCL, Flying Crew
    Chief (FCC), senior AMC representative (as applicable) will update the local MOC with
    information on significant factors impacting the recovery of en route aircraft.
    1.1.2.7. XOCL will coordinate with the aircraft commander, flight engineer, crew chief,
    senior AMC representative, tasked unit MOC (as applicable) to relay additional
    information required by MRTs. XOCL, FCC, senior AMC representative (as applicable)
    will update the recovery site local MOC (when applicable) with information on
    significant factors impacting the recovery of en route aircraft.
    1.1.2.8. XOCL directs and controls the recovery function by receiving and collecting
    information about broken aircraft that meet XOCL recovery involvement criteria as
    defined in Chapter 3 of this instruction. XOCL creates and maintains records of
    logistics status recovery maintenance and logistics history for each aircraft in the Global
    Decision Support System (GDSS). XOCL advises subordinate units through the local
    MOC when aircraft are diverted to or maintenance requirements are directed to their
    stations.
    1.1.2.9. Successful and expedient recovery of delayed aircraft depends upon accurate and
    timely communication between field personnel and XOCL. The primary means of
    relaying information between recovery sites and XOCL is via telephone. Use the
    following numbers to contact the XOCL: DSN, 779-0363; Toll Free Commercial 1-800-
    AIR-MOBL, options 2, then 1; Commercial, 618-229-0363; STE DSN 576-2425. If
    normal telephone communication is unavailable, use the most expeditious means possible
    to contact XOCL. Suitable systems include any of the following: Email at TACC-
    xocl@scott.af.mil, Satellite Communications (SATCOM DAMA-3), Global Decision
    Support System (GDSS), International Maritime Satellite (INMARSAT) phone, FAX.
    MRTs may contact XOCL via DSN FAX (779-7932), Commercial FAX, (618-229-
    7932).     XOCL Division Chief possesses SIPRNET capability.                  Email at
    TACC.xocl@scott.af.smil.mil. Refer to Chapter 8 for reach back communication
    CONOPS.
       1.1.2.9.1. XOCL will direct deployment of International Maritime Satellite
       (INMARSAT) phones, or other similar devices capable of global voice
       communication when tasking MRTs to locations with questionable communications
       support. Deployed communication systems are for official use only.
AMCI21-108 16 DECEMBER 2011                                                                   7


     1.1.2.10. XOCL will confirm maintenance recovery requirements to include all supply,
     MRT, and equipment needs and will confirm support capability at the aircraft location.
     XOCL will then direct the tasked MOC to obtain a maintenance history and provide a
     copy to the MRT to prevent unneeded trouble-shooting or maintenance.
     1.1.2.11. XOCL will utilize Air Force Global Logistics Support Center 435 SCOS for
     supply searches to locate required repair assets. If assets are located within other
     commands (as applicable), XOCL and the 435 SCOS/GWJ will coordinate release of
     assets with the applicable supply organization or 735th Supply Chain Operations Group
     (for Combat Air Forces).
        1.1.2.11.1. XOCL will consider local manufacture capability if applicable to the
        problem.
        1.1.2.11.2. XOCL determines when to cannibalize (CANN) for AMC and AMC-
        gained aircraft away from home station under XOCL control and will authorize and
        direct CANN actions as required. Aircraft commanders do not have the authority to
        direct/authorize cannibalizations. Additionally, supervision at staged/en route
        locations will not allow CANN actions from aircraft being directly supported by
        XOCL (via MRT, equipment or parts) without prior coordination/approval by XOCL.
        See AMC/PACAF MOA for PACAF C-17s on TWCF missions.
            1.1.2.11.2.1. Cannibalization from AFRC or ANG aircraft is restricted. XOCL
            will request cannibalization authority through HQ AFRC Command Center or
            ANG Readiness Center (as applicable) prior to authorizing a CANN action. If an
            AFRC/ANG unit is activated/mobilized, the aircraft and activated personnel will
            be treated the same as an active duty unit and XOCL may direct CANN actions as
            required.     XOCL will notify 613 AOC/AMD Logistics of intended
            cannibalization of PACAF C-17s on TWCF missions and provide supply data as
            required.
        1.1.2.11.3. When staged or deployed aircraft remaining under direct 618 AOC
        (TACC) control, to include in the Area of Responsibility (AOR), require JA parts for
        otherwise Mission Capable (MC) or partially mission capable (PMC) discrepancies
        deemed Mission Essential (ME) by aircrew or maintenance, the part will be ordered
        under 1A priority. This will preclude non-availability of aircraft for specific missions
        when the MC discrepancy directly contributes to the mission effectiveness of the
        aircraft in a particular mission, role or location. For example, Missile Warning
        System malfunctions may be a PMC discrepancy; however, a staged aircraft in the
        AOR may not be able to meet mission parameters without this system. Upon
        identification of a ME discrepancy for a JA part, staged/deployed maintenance will
        inform the appropriate supply function and XOCL upon ordering of the part that it is
        a JA part; however, it will be coded as 1A to ensure expedient handling. XOCL will
        coordinate the support with LSC. The intent of this paragraph is to allow stage
        locations the ability to report status in accordance with the appropriate Mission
        Essential Systems List (MESL) and AFI 21-103, but allow 618 AOC (TACC) and
        435 SCOS the ability to quickly and effectively support mission requirements.
        1.1.2.11.4. XOCL will coordinate with the 435 SCOS/GWJ to source and ship the
        part. XOCL will determine most expeditious method of transportation.

           1.1.2.11.4.1. 435 SCOS/GWJ will determine appropriate SBSS/ES-S supply
           processing procedures based on the recovery location of the aircraft and aircraft
           home station. 435 SCOS/GWJ will notify XOCL when tasked parts have been
           delivered to the applicable transportation section. Include the date, time, and
           name of the transportation specialist who received the part(s).
    1.1.2.12. XOCL will determine parts, MRT, and equipment transportation mode/route to
    the recovery site with the primary objective being the expeditious recovery of the aircraft.
    XOCL will take into account all factors available, including on-scene technical expertise
    (e.g., FCC, engineer, etc.) for additional insight into the problem.
       1.1.2.12.1. Transportation of parts/equipment/MRTs is primarily accomplished using
       AMC aircraft. 618 AOC (TACC) can coordinate special requirements XOCL may
       have for asset delivery, such as diverting aircraft, delaying scheduled departure, or
       adding additional missions to support recoveries. Special transportation authority for
       MICAP shipments to support en route recoveries is contained in AMCI 23-102,
       Expeditious Movement of AMC MICAP/VVIP Assets.
       1.1.2.12.2. Commercial transportation of MRTs and equipment is, in many cases, the
       most expeditious method. XOCL will direct commercial transportation if military
       airlift is not available or timely. The AMC unit tasked to provide transportation for
       resources must coordinate through their host Traffic Management Flight (TMF) to
       arrange for commercial transportation. For equipment, the tasked unit must provide
       shipping documents with appropriate funding citation.           Personnel requiring
       commercial transportation must provide valid travel orders. TMF will determine the
       fastest mode of commercial transportation based on the size, weight, dimensions, and
       destination of the parts and equipment. When using commercial transportation, mark
       all assets for priority handling as “Aircraft on Ground” (AOG).
       1.1.2.12.3. Surface transportation is sometimes the fastest means to move parts,
       MRTs, and equipment. XOCL is authorized to task unit vehicle operations to provide
       timely ground transportation for these items. Note: ANGRC Vehicle Operations
       function does not maintain vehicle operators during peacetime operations.
    1.1.2.13. XOCL will notify the tasked unit’s MOC, or other applicable agency, via
    telephone after determining tasking requirements.
    1.1.2.14. XOCL will ensure requirement of travel clearances, passports, or visa
    requirements     (as     applicable)  using    the     Foreign    Clearance      Guide
    (https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/fcg.cfm). XOCL will coordinate with the US Embassy
    and US Defense Attaché Office (DAO) at the recovery location if required. XOCL will
    review (if applicable) the Foreign Clearance Guide and provide the format to the unit.
    XOCL will advise MRT of travel priority, travel clearance requirements, and the need to
    have "Mission Route Support (MRS) Authorized" and "Mission Essential Personnel
    (MEP) Authorized," on travel orders. This enables the MRT to obtain correct travel
    arrangements from passenger service functions.
    1.1.2.15. XOCL directs shipment of applicable assets as prescribed in AMCI 23-102,
    Expeditious Movement of AMC MICAP/VVIP Assets. Parts will be marked “AMC
AMCI21-108 16 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 9


     MICAP/ very very important parts (VVIP)”. Personnel will use project codes assigned to
     AMC aircraft to ensure proper handling.
        1.1.2.15.1. For aircraft recoveries requiring shipment of aircraft parts, XOCL will
        provide 435 SCOS/GWJ the modes of shipment and where to pull the asset from.
        435 SCOS/GWJ will assign/obtain Transportation Control Numbers (TCN) in
        accordance with AMCI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization
        Reporting and the Defense Travel Regulation Part 2, and coordinate release of assets
        from the lateral organizations to laterally ship assets in accordance with given
        instructions.
        1.1.2.15.2. XOCL will coordinate with the AMC Aerial Port Control Center to
        expedite movement and ensure proper handling of recovery assets.
     1.1.2.16. XOCL will monitor progress of parts, MRT, and equipment in transit to
     recovery locations and once on site, XOCL will monitor status of MRT and/or recovery
     operations.
     1.1.2.17. XOCL will coordinate and monitor the return of MRT members, and
     equipment to place of origin after the aircraft is returned to mission capable status.
     XOCL will “assist” in returning due in for maintenance (DIFM) parts if the FCC/aircraft
     commander cannot perform the function due to mission or size of parts. XOCL
     assistance consists of coordinating supply turn-in or transportation for the parts to the
     owning base. Priority transportation is authorized for all resources in both directions.
     1.1.2.18. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, AMCSUP, Budget Guidance and Procedures,
     paragraph 10.2.13. (et seqq.) for funding guidance concerning MRT TDY support.

       taskings, but final authority to approve or disapprove unit’s shortfall request rests with
       the HQ AMC/A4O division chief or designated representative. Verbal shortfalls,
       approved by HQ AMC/A4O or designated representative, must be followed up with a
       written letter/e-mail routed to XOCL from the MXG/CC, CD, AMS/CC or equivalent on
       next duty day of the tasking release outlining circumstances driving the shortfall request.
   2.1.2. Ensure individuals selected for MRTs are fully qualified to perform and complete all
   anticipated tasks, including In-Process Inspections (IPI) and Red X sign-offs to include
   clearing repeat/recur discrepancies. Additionally, consider the experience level of the
   individual(s) selected when additional troubleshooting requirements are possible.
   2.1.3. Ensure TDY orders are generated to support the MRT tasking. Ensure the following
   authorizations are included: Mission Route Support (MRS) and Mission Essential Personnel
   (MEP). MRS permits the removal of cargo to allow space for the MRT and their equipment
   (see AMCI 24-101, Volume 14, Military Airlift - Passenger Service). MEP on non-organic
   missions will process through the passenger terminal and will fly as Space-R (duty standby)
   passengers. MRT personnel on organic aircraft are not required to process through the
   passenger terminal and may be manifested by the aircrew on DD Form 2131 Passenger
   Manifest, or included on approved flight authorization. However, MEP travelers must notify
   the ATOC/LGRD personnel of their intent to travel aboard a specific mission NLT 3 hours
   prior to departure time. They shall not normally be added to the mission after that point if it
   shall adversely impact manifested passengers. Additionally, advance per diem, commercial
   travel authorization, rental car authorization, excess baggage authorization, and variations
   authorized will be included. Priority transportation is authorized for all resources in both
   travel directions.
   2.1.4. After identification of the MRT Chief, ensure they are fully briefed of their
   responsibilities and are familiar with responsibilities IAW Chapter 5 of this instruction.
   2.1.5. Be prepared to rapidly deploy crash recovery equipment and/or personnel for their
   Mission Design Series (MDS) if directed by XOCL to recover AMC or AMC gained assets.

               PRODUCTION SUPERINTENDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

4.1. Production Superintendent Responsibilities. The tasked unit’s on duty production
superintendent, or senior maintenance representative when no production superintendent is on
duty, is critical to the successful recovery of aircraft under the control of XOCL.
   4.1.1. The production superintendent will ensure timely and accurate information concerning
   XOCL tasking is forwarded to the MOC.
   4.1.2. When informed of an XOCL tasking the unit production superintendent will ensure
   the following requirements are accomplished as applicable:
       4.1.2.1. The production superintendent will ensure all required parts and/or equipment
       are properly sourced and issued to the MRT chief to hand-carry to the deployment site.
       Items too large or heavy to be carried will be coordinated with XOCL. Ensure
       coordination with Base Supply Equipment Management section concerning deployment
       of accountable equipment. If CANN actions are directed, coordinate with the MOC to
       initiate actions on selected aircraft or engine. The production superintendent will ensure
       all required parts and/or equipment are properly prepared/purged prior to delivery to
       supply or TMF.
       4.1.2.2. The Packing and Crating section at each station maintains a block of TCNs and
       assigns them as required for the shipment of property. For shipment by AMC airlift,
       MRT parts and/or equipment are considered “maintenance property” and not “supply
       parts.” Equipment and parts shipped commercially are also coordinated with TMF.
       Note: Care must be taken to maintain accountability and satisfy open DIFM details,
       particularly for parts moving by AMC airlift. This paragraph must not be interpreted as a
       relief from DIFM accountability.
       4.1.2.3. The production superintendent will verify proper preparation of shipping
       documents (DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document). Include POC
       and phone number plus an in the clear address to include building number, street address,
       and US or host nation zip code.
       4.1.2.4. The production superintendent will ensure timely delivery of tasked assets to the
       Packing and Crating section.
       4.1.2.5. The production superintendent will ensure that all items are assigned
       transportation control number (TCN) and marked as "999 AMC MICAP, VVIP". Include
       applicable project codes assigned in AMCI 23-102, Expeditious Movement of AMC
       MICAP/VVIP Assets.
       4.1.2.6. For equipment only taskings, the production superintendent will ensure
       equipment includes all applicable accessories, documentation, has a current inspection
       that will not come due while deployed and is in fully operational condition.
       4.1.2.7. For parts only taskings, the production superintendent or appropriate lead tech
       will open all boxes and visually inspect each part to ensure enclosed part is correct,

     serviceable, and complete. XOCL can waive this requirement if checking parts will
     cause a significant delay to the recovery.
     4.1.2.8. The production superintendent will record all TCNs and forward information to
     MOC.
  4.1.3. The production superintendent will coordinate duty schedule and maintenance actions
  of MRTs deployed to their location, with the deployed MRT team chief. The production
  superintendent in conjunction with the MRT team chief will ensure XOCL is informed of
  duty schedules/activities associated with aircraft under XOCL control.
  4.1.4. The on-duty production superintendent at the broke aircraft’s location will work with
  the MRT chief in providing the necessary resources the MRT may need. The production
  superintendent may not pull the MRT from working its designated aircraft without prior
  coordination with XOCL.
     4.1.4.1. If the supply part was shipped through the LRS at the aircraft home station base,
     take the asset to the recovery location LRS for SBSS/ES-S receipt processing. Turn-in
     unserviceable asset at recovery location also.

          MAINTENANCE RECOVERY TEAM CHIEF RESPONSIBILITIES

5.1. The Maintenance Recovery Team (MRT) Chief Responsibilities. The MRT Chief is
responsible for the proper execution of pre-deployment, deployment, employment/on-scene
recovery, and re-deployment actions. While assigned to the MRT, personnel are directly
responsible to XOCL and will contact them for resolution of any problems. If the recovery
location is an AMC base or fixed en route, the MRT is responsible to the local AMC MXG/CC,
CD-M or senior AMC maintenance person (as applicable) upon arrival through departure. The
MRT will coordinate all requirements through XOCL, the local MOC and local production
superintendent (as applicable). If located at a non-AMC or non-USAF location, coordinate with
XOCL, the local MOC, Transient Alert, and either the on-station AMC Contingency Response
Group (CRG), or the aircraft commander (as applicable). The MRT chief is responsible for all
parts, equipment, and personnel deployed with or sent as follow up support to MRT locations.
   5.1.1. The MRT chief will report to the MOC for a mission briefing, receipt of an MRT
   folder and INMARSAT and/or other voice communication device provided by HQ AMC if
   tasked by XOCL. Refer to Chapter 8 of this instruction for reach back communication
   guidance.
       5.1.1.1. The MRT chief will ensure all personnel assigned to the MRT are qualified
       (review AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder, or equivalent, and MIS
       training run), prepared for, and are aware of their part in recovery actions.
   5.1.2. The MRT Chief will accomplish a history check on the aircraft by reviewing the
   discrepancy, doing a work unit code/ref des inquiry in the MIS using screen 8070 and
   reviewing the history for the past 30, 60, and 90-days.
   5.1.3. The MRT chief will coordinate travel arrangements with the host TMF when directed
   by XOCL. The MRT chief will notify XOCL of specific travel plans when confirmed.
       5.1.3.1. The MRT chief will not self-procure commercial transportation. Travelers who
       self-procure commercial transportation will not be reimbursed unless they can prove that
       self-procurement was the only way to meet mission requirements.
   5.1.4. The MRT chief will ensure proper technical data is available or carried with the team
   to complete the task.
   5.1.5. When tasked, the MRT chief will sign for and become familiar with use of the
   INMARSAT and/or other voice communication devices provided for MRT use. The MRT
   chief will view training video, set up phone, and call XOCL prior to deployment.
   5.1.6. The MRT chief will verify all necessary parts are available and taken with the MRT as
   directed by XOCL. The MRT chief will coordinate with Aerial Port (if applicable). The
   MRT chief will open container(s) to ensure the part(s) received are the parts that were
   ordered. The MRT chief will review repair procedures contained in the applicable technical
   orders to ensure attaching hardware and any other attaching parts that may have been (or will
   be) disconnected or damaged in the assembly/disassembly process are available.

     5.1.6.1. MRT team chief will be briefed by MOC/XOCL on where the supply DIFM
     assets are to be turned in: back to MRT location, broke location, or aircraft home station.
  5.1.7. The MRT chief will ensure all test and support equipment is inventoried, calibrated,
  has a current inspection that will not come due while deployed and is fully operational,
  contains all necessary accessory items (i.e., test leads, adapters, etc.), and if applicable, is
  loaded with the correct software to support the MDS (block and serial number) to be
  repaired, prior to dispatch.
  5.1.8. The MRT chief will coordinate with the aerial port to ensure all required parts and
  equipment are assembled, inventoried, and loaded on the support aircraft. The MRT chief
  will physically validate the presence and condition of all MRT assets. Small items may be
  hand-carried by the MRT to prevent loss. Do not check hand-carried items as baggage on
  commercial flights unless required by the Transportation Security Agency (TSA).
  5.1.9. The MRT chief will notify XOCL and the AMC MOC if applicable, immediately
  upon arrival at the recovery site. The MRT chief will make an initial assessment of aircraft
  recovery requirements and update XOCL of status, provide duty phone, cell phone, e-mail
  address (if applicable), billeting location, billeting phone number and room extension if
  applicable to XOCL, the local MOC, and the local supporting agency (i.e., transient alert
  (T/A) or flight line maintenance unit). Telephone services are often difficult to arrange at
  off-line recovery sites. Use the most convenient, expeditious method available. Commercial
  telephone number is (call collect if necessary), 618-229-0363 or 1-800-247-6625 (AIR
  MOBL) Option 2 then 1. If you have difficulty contacting the XOCL directly, call your
  home station MOC to relay information. The status of recovery operations is constantly
  monitored by XOCL and senior AMC leadership and up-to-date information is not only
  critical, but mandatory.
     5.1.9.1. If asset was shipped through the LRS at the aircraft home station, take asset to
     recovery location LRS for receipt processing. Turn-in unserviceable DIFM assets at
     recovery location also.
     5.1.9.2. MRT will start work immediately upon arrival, dependent upon availability of
     the aircraft, field operating hours, and length of MRT duty day. A 16-hour duty day is
     authorized on the first day only to allow for travel time. The duty day is computed
     starting at the time of initial report for duty at home station. The MRT chief works under
     the guidance of XOCL and will coordinate successive duty hours for the MRT. At
     CONUS locations with AMC units or OCONUS fixed en route locations, the MRT chief
     will also coordinate all duty schedule requirements with the local production
     superintendent. The MRT chief will assess conditions at the recovery site and establish a
     duty schedule with the local production superintendent (as applicable) that balances
     aircraft recovery needs with proper health and welfare needs of MRT members. Normal
     work/rest periods are 12-hours of work followed by 12-hours of rest. As a minimum,
     each MRT member is provided the opportunity for 8-hours of uninterrupted sleep,
     exclusive of transportation to and from the billeting location and time to eat.
     5.1.9.3. The MRT chief will coordinate with the local production superintendent or on-
     site maintenance supervision to review local operating instructions. MRTs will adhere to
     local maintenance operating instructions of the location they are deployed to.
AMCI21-108 16 DECEMBER 2011                                                                  19


     5.1.9.4. The following procedures will be used to report maintenance progress to the
     XOCL and the local MOC if available:
         5.1.9.4.1. The MRT chief will report maintenance and supply status changes and
         additional requirements (e.g., parts, equipment, and expertise) as they become known.
         If it is determined that additional equipment is required, check with local maintenance
         operations and/or facilities for availability. If the equipment is available from a US
         Department of Defense agency and they will allow its use, advise the XOCL of its use
         on your next call. If the equipment is available from any other source (e.g., civilian
         contractor, allied military unit, etc.) contact XOCL. XOCL will ensure that the
         equipment usage is approved to alleviate any billing conflicts. The aircraft
         commander is authorized to contract for needed equipment using AF IMT 15, United
         States Air Force Invoice. Any equipment that is not available will be provided to the
         MRT through XOCL coordination.
         5.1.9.4.2. The MRT chief will report work progress status every 6-hours or no later
         than expiration of current ETIC. The MRT chief will keep the local AMC production
         superintendent informed of all work progress (as applicable).
         5.1.9.4.3. The MRT chief will report start time of work, shift changes, and all work
         stoppages, to include end of shift status or job completion.
  5.1.10. The MRT team chief will notify the local MOC or XOCL whenever an Engineering
  Disposition (ED) is required. If at an established en route location, the MRT chief will
  ensure en route supervision is aware of the need for an ED. The MRT chief will ensure
  XOCL receives a copy of the submitted Request for Engineering Disposition (REDI) and a
  copy of the final ED. The specific MDS REDI procedures listed below will be followed
  when submitting a request for engineering disposition, T.O. 00-25-107, for AMC supported
  aircraft on AMC missions that are not mission capable (NMC) when away from home
  station.
     5.1.10.1. C-130: Aircrew or maintenance (if available) will submit their request through
     AIRCAT. If the aircraft is NMC at a location where access to AIRCAT is not available,
     the aircrew/maintenance should contact the aircraft's home station and request they
     submit the 107 request through AIRCAT. Once the 107 request has been submitted
     through AIRCAT, a copy of the technical assistance request (TAR) should be sent via fax
     or e-mail to XOCL. XOCL will ensure the C-130 weapon system manager (WSM) is
     aware of the request. When the engineering disposition is issued, the aircrew, local
     maintenance, or the home station will send a copy of the completed TAR to XOCL via
     fax or e-mail as soon as possible. XOCL will ensure the WSM receives a copy of the
     disposition. Access to AIRCAT can established through the following web address:
     https://c130aircat.robins.af.mil/applications/login.aspx Follow the instructions listed
     to establish an account.
     5.1.10.2. C-5: Aircrew or maintenance (if available) will contact the closest AFETS
     Representative or maintenance specialist in theater to determine if a Request
     for Engineering Disposition (REDI) is required. AFETS will then submit the request to
     WR-ALC through the C-5 website. Enroutes who routinely service C-5 aircraft should
     ensure QA or MOC personnel at their locations have login rights to the C-5 web site to
     retrieve completed REDI’s. If the AFETS Rep is not available, or approves the need for a
20                                                       AMCI21-108 16 DECEMBER 2011


     REDI, then the authorized maintenance personnel will accomplish the REDI through the
     C-5 Website. If the requester does not have access to the C-5 website, they will forward a
     copy of the request to XOCL by email, fax or telephone (use of telephone to submit the
     request should be restricted to emergency situations). If the copy is faxed or e-mailed, a
     follow up phone call should be made to ensure XOCL is aware of the incoming 107.
     XOCL will notify engineering (WSM office will provide current engineering contact list
     to XOCL) of the request and forward copies to engineering and the WSM office. If
     engineering cannot be immediately contacted, XOCL will notify the WSM of the request.
     The WSM will notify engineering, send them the request and ensure a copy of the
     engineers final ED is returned to XOCL. Access to the C-5 website can be established
     through the following web address: https://c5galaxy.robinscd.af.mil. Follow the
     instructions listed to establish an account.
     5.1.10.3. C-17: Aircrew or maintenance will contact the closest C-17 Boeing engineer or
     maintenance specialist to ascertain if an engineering disposition is required. If required,
     submit written request (on standardized form) through AF channels via owning aircraft
     wing QA. Engineering "first contact" will enable Boeing field engineering technical
     services to work the engineering disposition in parallel to the REDI being processed by
     the owning wing quality assurance. A copy of the REDI as well as a copy of the
     engineer's disposition should be sent to XOCL via fax or e-mail as soon as possible.
     XOCL will ensure the WSM knows of the request and the disposition.
     5.1.10.4. KC-135: Aircrew or maintenance (if available) will submit their request to
     their home station quality assurance (QA) office. The home station will submit the 107
     request to the 327th TSG (formerly the KC-135 SPO) with an info copy to
     AMC/A4MYD and XOCL. If more than technical guidance/assistance is required, e.g.,
     CLSS team, AMC/A4MYD must command certify before the team is allowed to
     proceed/be dispatched. A copy of the engineer's disposition will be sent via fax or e-mail
     to XOCL.
     5.1.10.5. KC-10: Aircrew or maintenance (if available) will submit their request through
     the owning group's quality assurance (QA) office. The home station will submit the 107
     request in eDARS to the 727th CLSG through AMC/A4MYD (KC-10 weapon system
     manager) for approval. A copy of the eDAR with the engineering disposition will be sent
     to XOCL via fax or e-mail. XOCL will ensure the WSM is aware of the request and the
     disposition.
  5.1.11. The MRT chief will contact XOCL if a discrepancy must be cleared on a system for
  which no one on the team is qualified. XOCL will follow guidelines in applicable 00-20-1
  technical data and, applicable AMC supplements to resolve the issue.
  5.1.12. The MRT chief will not allow the MRT to work on aircraft not supported by XOCL
  without prior coordination with XOCL.
  5.1.13. The MRT chief will ensure all equipment, parts, and supplies are accounted for and
  return transportation has been coordinated with XOCL prior to return to home station.
     5.1.13.1. The MRT chief will ensure all equipment that cannot be returned with the MRT
     has the proper documentation and is receipted in by the recovery site Transportation
AMCI21-108 16 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 21


     Office. The MRT chief will also notify XOCL with the status and the TCNs of the
     equipment not being returned.
     5.1.13.2. MRT team chief will ensure reparables are turned in with applicable
     maintenance documents (at recovery location supply, home station, or MRT location)
     depending on XOCL-briefed instructions to properly clear DIFM details. If the MRT has
     questions about disposition of supply assets, they will contact XOCL for instructions.
     5.1.13.3. If applicable, the MRT will initiate required deficiency report (DR) IAW T.O.
     00-35D-54 and attach to the part at time of turn-in. This will ensure supply personnel are
     provided a copy of the initial report to process the DR exhibit.
  5.1.14. Upon return to home station the MRT chief will immediately notify MOC of their
  return. The MOC will contact XOCL to confirm/relay MRT return. The MRT team chief
  will also notify their unit production superintendent and section chief upon return to home
  station.

                                            Chapter 7

                    SUPPLY PROCEDURES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

7.1. Supply Procedures and Responsibilities. Supply Procedures and Responsibilities are as
follows:
       7.1.1. The Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) commander or supply activity
       supporting a recovery will:
   7.1.2. Ensure XOCL-directed requisitions and shipments for both CONUS and OCONUS
   bases receive required manual intervention, prompt response, and close oversight.
   7.1.3. Perform stock checks to satisfy area searches when notified by 435 SCOS/GWJ.
   7.1.4. Ensure the supply technician/chief inspector verifies the documentation. Also ensure
   they check the contents of the container/box and verify that the stock number, part number
   and quantity match the documentation and shelf life has not expired as required. Before
   shipping, ensure a production supervisor or appropriate lead technician inspects the item(s) to
   ensure accuracy and serviceability per paragraph 4.1.2.7. Items should be function checked
   (time permitting) prior to shipment. For additional guidance, reference AFMAN 23-110,
   Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 4, Inspection and Related Operations; AFMAN 23-110, Volume
   2, Part 2, Chapter 10, Physical Asset Management and AMCI 23-102, paragraph 2.4.8.2.
   Prepare assets for shipment following guidance provided by 435 SCOS/GWJ.
   7.1.5. Coordinate with the host TMF as required.
       7.1.5.1. Mark all items shipped by commercial carriers with “First available delivery”,
       and identify them as “Required for a Not Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) status
       aircraft, and/or aircraft on ground (AOG).”
       7.1.5.2. Mark parts shipments required to support any aircraft supported by the XOCL
       with “Project Code 196” and required delivery date “999.”
   7.1.6. Ensure supply personnel notify 435 SCOS/GWJ when XOCL MICAP parts are
   delivered to the appropriate transportation section by faxing the completed AMC IMT 18.
   Include the date, time, and name of the transportation specialist who received the part(s).
7.2. Munitions Requirements: When munitions items (e.g., squibs) are required to support en
route aircraft, order them through the appropriate local munitions activity. The local munitions
activity will support the requirement if possible and be back filled as soon as possible from the
aircraft home station munitions activity. If the requirement is not supportable locally, the request
will be handled on a case by case basis through the local munitions activity, aircraft home station
munitions activity and parent MAJCOM. Under no circumstances should local maintenance
requisition the items and arrange for shipment on their own.
7.3. Part Sourcing: (Figures 7.1. and 7.2.)
   7.3.1. A major concern for supply is ensuring accountability of reparable assets after the
   recovery. To ensure maximum asset control through the entire recovery process, part
   requests should be processed in the following order (based on criteria) with the first choice
AMCI21-108 16 DECEMBER 2011                                                                     25


   being the most preferred option whereas the final option being the least preferred. Reference
   figures 7.1 and 7.2 to view the flow chart process as outlined below.

Table 7.1. Accountability of DIFM assets
    Supply Activity Options                  DIFM Control
If AF supply activity is present,   Asset turned into local AF
part will be issued/backordered     supply activity at the recovery

of cost.
 If AF supply activity is not       If asset ordered from aircraft
present at the recovery location,   home station, part will be
parts will be ordered from the      returned to home station to
aircraft home station or from       clear DIFM account. . If asset
MRT-originating base.               ordered from MRT-originating
                                    base, parts will be returned to
                                    originating base.
   7.3.2. To ensure we make the rules of engagement for DIFM returns as simple as possible,
   the maintainer will only need to know how the sourcing supply activity processed their
   paperwork: a shipment (SHP) or an issue (ISU/MSI) which is found clearly noted on the DD
   Form 1348, DOD Single Line Item Requisition System Document (Manual) or on a Asset
   Management label. When in doubt, the 435 SCOS/GWJ at DSN 779-8486 (commercial
   618-229-8486) can assist in determining where to return the asset.
       7.3.2.1. If the sourcing supply activity processed a shipment (SHP) to the AF supply
       activity at the recovery location, then the part will be turned in at the recovery location.
       This is the most preferred choice since it relieves the maintainer of responsibility at the
       recovery location.
       7.3.2.2. If the sourcing supply activity processes an issue (ISU/MSI) the part must be
       returned to the sourcing supply activity. This is the least preferred choice since it holds
       the maintainer accountable until the asset is returned to the sourcing supply activity.
       Accordingly, this will only be done when no AF supply activity is present at the recovery
       location.
           7.3.2.2.1. Supply ISU/MSI paperwork (DD Form 1348 or equivalent label) will
           accompany parts shipped to recovery location, including spares shipped on DD Forms
           1149, so maintainers will know where to return the unserviceable spare.

                        OPERATIONS (CONOPS)

8.1. Logistics Global Reach Back Communications. This CONOPS outlines logistics global
reach back communications strategy for Maintenance Recovery Teams (MRT) and deployed
AMC maintenance forces. Communications reach back kits are the primary element of this
strategy. Kits are designed to provide worldwide voice and data communication for MRTs and
to provide logistics reach back for maintainers deployed to austere locations.
8.2. Requirements. MRTs and deployed personnel require reliable communications systems to
accomplish aircraft recovery, report aircraft status and communicate logistics issues and needs to
supporting agencies such as the 618 AOC (TACC) and HQ AMC/A4. Required capabilities and
associated equipment are listed below:

   computer, digital camera, spare/rechargeable batteries and charging system for all equipment,
   surge protector, voltage regulator/ transformer, and a carry case with locks. Applicable
   software will be installed on laptops to facilitate receipt of e-mail, FAXs, G081 etc.
8.3. Kit Employment. Kits will be deployed to designated AMC bases as determined by HQ
AMC/A4 offices and 618 AOC (TACC).
8.4. Kit Employment. Kits are tasked by 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCL. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCL
will coordinate kit deployments to ensure kits are used for the highest priority mission. Kits are

not for use with AMOG units, as they possess mobile command and control equipment. Kits
will be tasked in the following manner:
   8.4.1. MRTs: 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCL will task kits with MRTs based on aircraft recovery
   location and severity of the maintenance problem. Straightforward repairs may not require
   the entire kit. In such events, 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCL should task an Iridium phone to
   reduce the amount of equipment the MRT must carry. The tasked MOC will record the name
   and rank of individuals tasked with whole or partial kits.
   8.4.2. Deployments: 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCL will evaluate deployment locations and task
   kits accordingly, based on location and existing infrastructure. Priority will be given to
   austere locations. Personnel responsible for the kit will communicate their name, rank, and
   contact information to XOCL at first opportunity.
   8.4.3. INMARSAT systems are intended for data transmission only. Use INMARSATs for
   voice communication if no other means is available (to include locally based assets such as a
   CRE etc.).
   8.4.4. Kits will be hand-carried by deploying personnel and not shipped as checked baggage.
8.5. Kit Maintenance/Storage. Reach back kits will be maintained through the owning base
LOGNET office and stored in the Maintenance Group Maintenance Operations Center (MOC).
The MOC will maintain training aids for kits and familiarize deploying personnel on kit use prior
to departure.
   8.5.1. HQ AMC/A4PI is responsible for procuring or producing training aids. Materials
   should be user/friendly and easy to read/understand in a field environment.

                                           Chapter 9

             INTERNATIONAL CROSS-SERVICING OF NMC AIRCRAFT

9.1. Approval Authorities and Responsibilities:
   9.1.1. A4RX provides international support guidance and oversees AMC’s Acquisition and
   Cross Servicing Agreement (ACSA) program. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCL provides unit level
   assistance and advice 24/7 for the specific purpose of recovering NMC aircraft; ensuring
   efficient recoveries, when appropriate, of both US and foreign transient aircraft. Units
   requesting assistance will provide completed documents and checklists to 618 AOC
   (TACC)/XOCL as outlined throughout this chapter.
   9.1.2. Unit level approval authority is expressly limited to the repair and recovery of NMC
   aircraft. All other foreign support requests must be directed to AMC/A4RX for resolution
   (an example would be the long-term use or lease of AMC equipment).
   9.1.3. Authorizing international aircraft cross-mx is accomplished using the legal authority
   obtained from United States Code (USC) “Title 10, Sections 2341-2350”, Acquisition and
   Cross-Servicing Agreements (ACSA). Under ACSA, logistic support exchanges are
   voluntary and at the discretion of the entity providing support. Each request is considered on
   a case-by-case basis, evaluated for legal authority, capability to support, and the supporting
   entity’s mission impact if the request is supported. This chapter provides AMC commanders
   with instructions concerning the authority to exchange logistics support with international
   partners for the purpose of recovering NMC aircraft. This chapter addresses support
   exchanges using separate checklists that pertain to AMC as the “support provider” or the
   “support receiver.”
   9.1.4. While all cross-mx requests and non-F77 supply assets are addressed via the ACSA
   checklists in paragraph 9.5, routine aerial port services and/or F77 supply assets are not:
       9.1.4.1. Routine aerial port services. All nations are provided routine aerial port services
       IAW AFI 10-1801, IC-1, Foreign Governmental Aircraft Landings at USAF
       Installations. This chapter is not applicable to AMC units providing routine port
       services. AFI 10-1801, IC-1 provides guidance concerning provisions of routine port
       services and identifies mandatory reimbursable and non-reimbursable routine port
       services.
       9.1.4.2. F77 managed assets. F77 assets are C-17 assets with a Source of Supply (SOS)
       code F77. These assets are centrally managed by Boeing as a virtual spares pool, and as
       such, are issued from our AF supply system at no cost to any consuming unit, US or
       Foreign. International C-17 partners have bought into this virtual spares pool via the
       Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. AMC maintenance commanders are authorized
       to provide F77 assets to C-17 virtual fleet partners (Australia, Canada, UK, Qatar, and
       NAMO) using the guidance in paragraph 9.6.2.
9.2. Checklists for Logistical Exchanges.
   9.2.1. AMC units as the support provider are managed via Figure 9.1 and AMC units as the
   support receiver are managed via Figure 9.2. AMC units receiving or providing support will
   complete the appropriate checklists (and all related documents) and send via e-mail to 618

9.3. Supply Guidance:
    9.3.1. Supply and mx commander guidance when AMC is providing supply asset support.
    The providing unit, with the approval of the appropriate senior maintenance commander, in
    consultation with the appropriate supply commander, will determine if supply assets can be
    provided to a NMC foreign aircraft using the following procedures.
    9.3.2. Issuing C-17 aircraft parts and consumables with a Source of Supply (SOS) code F77.
    F77 assets are defined in para 9.1.4.2. Providing maintenance commanders are authorized to
    issue F77 assets using the following guidance:
        9.3.2.1. The part must be unclassified. If the asset is classified, deny or delay support
        until A4RXP can coordinate with appropriate agencies during normal AMC duty hours.
        9.3.2.2. The senior maintenance commander must determine that providing the asset will
        not negatively impact their mission.
        9.3.2.3. When the asset is repairable (DIFM asset), the requesting C-17 nation must
        agree to immediately exchange the unserviceable F77 part for the issued serviceable part.
    9.3.3. When the above conditions are met, the most appropriate AMC maintenance
    organization will order the part on their AMC supply account. If the requirement is actually
    loaded in GO81 with a valid job control number (JCN), requisitions will be processed in
    GO81 with an activity code “J” document number. If there is no GO81 JCN, the requisition
    will be processed directly with the base supply activity using SBSS or ES-S under an activity
    code “X” document number. For either scenario, assets are ordered non-recurring, using the
    foreign aircraft tail number and nation/organization being supported as the “mark-for”. The
36                                                       AMCI21-108 16 DECEMBER 2011


  last two positions of the mark-for will be the ACSA country code from figure 9.3. An
  example mark for would be “CC0006516ALWCA” (Tail CC00065, Unit 516 ALW, from
  Canada). In order to clear the DIFM detail, the unserviceable foreign part is immediately
  returned to the providing maintenance organization and turned in to supply as unserviceable.
  Financial reimbursement to the AF will occur automatically via the Boeing managed Virtual
  Fleet contract.
     9.3.3.1. The same process outlined in 9.6.2 applies to F77 consumables with exception
     of the requirement to return/clear DIFM detail.
  9.3.4. Providing non-F77 managed aircraft parts to any aircraft type. Non-F77 repairable
  supply assets can be provided but the procedures are different than F77 issues. Non-F77
  repairable (DIFM) assets are managed as a Replacement-In-Kind (RIK) ACSA transaction.
  The following conditions must be met to provide non-F77 assets:
     9.3.4.1. The requesting nation/organization has a concluded ACSA with the US DOD.
     Only those countries identified in Figure 9.3 meet this criterion. If the country is not
     listed in Figure 9.3, their support request must be denied.
     9.3.4.2. Aircraft parts must be of the same configurations (modification) and must not be
     classified or sensitive. If the asset is classified or security sensitive, deny or delay
     support until A4RXP can coordinate with appropriate agencies during normal AMC duty
     hours.
     9.3.4.3. The affected senior maintenance commander having oversight of the asset must
     determine that providing the asset will not negatively impact their mission.
     9.3.4.4. The receiving party must agree to provide an RIK asset for repairable (DIFM)
     items, to include a worst case return date of a serviceable asset. Consumable parts can be
     RIK or cash (funds transferred at a later date), as negotiated by the approving
     maintenance official. The approving maintenance official may deny support based on an
     unacceptable return date; however, the replacement timeframe may never exceed 1 year.
     9.3.4.5. An ACSA MLS order form is required for each transaction IAW Figure 9.4 and
     associated instructions. The ACSA paperwork MUST be completed PRIOR to issue of
     any non-F77 asset.
     9.3.4.6. Supply system transactions will occur as follows:
         9.3.4.6.1. Issuing non-F77 reparable asset. In most instances, assets will be ordered
         and issued by and to the most appropriate AMC organization using their account;
         however, if the requesting nation has an organizational account loaded at your base,
         the issue transaction(s) will be run using that account. The issue transaction will use
         the foreign aircraft tail number and nation supported as the “mark for”, with last two
         positions being the ACSA country code from Figure 9.3. An example mark for is
         “CC0006516ALWCA” (Tail CC00065, Unit 516 ALW, from Canada). The asset
         will be ordered as initial issue to enable immediate resupply and requisitioning. The
         appropriate providing maintenance organization will accomplish an “Initial Issue
         Letter”, citing the nation supported aircraft type and foreign tail number. The
         receiving nation must return a serviceable asset NLT the negotiated date to fulfill the
         RIK transaction. The receiving organization must notify HQ AMC/A4RX when the
AMCI21-108 16 DECEMBER 2011                                                                   37


          RIK part is returned, inspected and confirmed serviceable. The maintenance
          organization will return the asset to supply as a found-on-base (FOB) turn-in; either
          as a serviceable asset or unserviceable if the condition cannot be confirmed. If the
          requirement is actually loaded in GO81 with a valid job control number (JCN),
          requisitions will be processed in GO81 with an activity code “J” document number.
          If there is no GO81 JCN, the requisition will be processed directly with the base
          supply activity using SBSS or ES-S under an activity code “X” document number.
          9.3.4.6.2. Issuing non-F77 consumable assets. Consumable assets can be provided
          via paragraph 9.1.4.1 and billed directly IAW AFI 10-1801 if appropriate because
          support is associated with a routine port service; or via an ACSA transaction if the
          issue is not associated with routine port services. ACSA transaction may either be a
          RIK or cash transaction. The providing commander determines if the issue will be
          managed as RIK or cash based on their mission needs, as negotiated with the
          requesting nation. For cash transactions, the FEDLOG price will be used. If not
          billed directly as a routine port service, an ACSA MLS Order Form is required.
          Order forms are accomplished IAW Figure 9.4 and associated instructions. The
          ACSA paperwork must be completed prior to issuance. The supply procedures
          identified in 9.3. are used to issue parts.
          9.3.4.6.3. Supply and maintenance commander guidance when AMC is requesting
          and receiving supply support.     The receiving unit, with the approval of the
          appropriate senior maintenance commander will determine if supply assets will be
          requested.
   9.3.5. Requesting C-17 aircraft parts and consumables with a Source of Supply (SOS) code
   F77. AMC units may request assets from other C-17 virtual fleet nations when NMC away
   from home station and determine this to be the best course of action. The same F77
   principles apply for requesting support as for providing support. These transactions do not
   require an ACSA form and are accomplished at the discretion of the providing foreign
   commander based on their mission requirements. There is no financial impact to either
   nation.
   9.3.6. Requesting non-F77 assets and consumables. Again, the same principles, reversed,
   apply to these requests. Repairable assets will be accomplished as an ACSA RIK
   transaction, and the US unit must provide a return date not greater than 1 year and ensure the
   asset is returned as agreed. Providing the asset is at the discretion of the providing nation.
   Consumables can be accomplished as RIK or cash transactions. Prior to accepting support,
   an ACSA order form must be accomplished IAW figure 9.4 and associated instructions.
9.4. Aircraft Maintenance Guidance. The senior on-scene and/or aircraft home station
maintenance officer determines if mx support will be provided or accepted from eligible ACSA
nations/organizations. Maintenance support includes anything from actual hands on aircraft mx
to the loan of tools, manpower, test and/or other ground support equipment. NOTE: The USAF
cannot allow foreign nations or organizations access to USAF technical orders, instructions or
other classified information, parts or equipment via ACSA authority.
   9.4.1. Equipment and tools can be loaned/borrowed if the following conditions are
   confirmed:
 38                                                         AMCI21-108 16 DECEMBER 2011


       9.4.1.1. The nation or organization has a concluded ACSA and is listed in Figure 9.1
       9.4.1.2. The using personnel are trained or request manpower assistance.
       9.4.1.3. The equipment is not classified.
       9.4.1.4. The providing unit determines the loan creates no negative mission impacts.
   9.4.2. Tools and equipment can usually be loaned without generating an invoice unless the
   providing unit identifies additive costs that should be reimbursed. If use generates direct
   additive costs, the providing unit generates an ACSA order form IAW paragraph 9.5 and
   figure 9.4 and associated instructions. When an AMC unit is requesting tools or equipment
   use, the requesting unit will only agree to reimburse for direct additive costs. If foreign
   nation insists on leasing fees not associated with a direct additive cost, then the unit will
   withdraw the support request and self-support using USAF assets.
   9.4.3. Providing or receiving hands on aircraft maintenance. The requesting nation must
   oversee the work because they must document and clear their own aircraft mx records.
   Accepting or providing mx from foreign nations via ACSA is authorized if:
       9.4.3.1. The nation has a concluded ACSA, listed in Figure 9.3.
       9.4.3.2. The senior AMC on-scene and/or aircraft home station maintenance officer
       determines if support will be requested or provided based on mission impact, manpower
       availability, training considerations evaluation, and any other relevant risk factors to task
       being performed.
       9.4.3.3. The mx task does not involve classified US systems.
   9.4.4. Cross mx actions will be documented on an ACSA order form to capture the
   international support transaction and to compile manpower impact data. AMC will not bill
   for labor, and will never agree to pay mx labor. When AMC is requesting mx, the requesting
   AMC unit must withdrawal their request if the foreign military insists on labor
   reimbursements. The cost documented on the ACSA order form will be $0.00 for labor.
9.5. Transportation Guidance. Either party to a support request may coordinate support from
another off-site unit capable and willing to provide support. All shipping costs to and from the
supported location, to include airlift, TDY travel, and specially procured commercial shipments
are reimbursable to the supplying party. AMC providing or requesting units must complete an
ACSA order form IAW Figure 9.4 and associated instructions.
   9.5.1. Some nations have established Transportation Account Codes (TAC) and Customer
   Identification Codes (CIC) to use AMC transportation system. When applicable, movements
   using the nation’s TAC or CIC can be accomplished without a need for an ACSA order form,
   see Table 9.1 below for nations with established codes.
AMCI21-108 16 DECEMBER 2011                                                                      39


Table 9.1. Preapproved Foreign Transportation Account Codes (TAC) and Customer
Identification Codes (CIC).




   9.5.2. When the use of a TAC or CIC is not possible, AMC units absorbing transportation
   costs must accomplish an ACSA order form to receive reimbursement. Do to the nature of
   these expenses; it may not be possible to determine an exact cost until well after the service
   is provided. In these instances, it is perfectly acceptable to identify the cost as estimated and
   follow-up later with an actual cost. However, it is important to accomplish an estimated
   ACSA form so the requesting nation understands there will be a bill to follow. ACSA forms
   are accomplished IAW Figure 9.2 and associated instructions.
   9.5.3. Support documentation on actual cost must be provided to HQ AMC/A4RX when
   known.
   9.5.4. AMC units may also reimburse foreign militaries for travel and transportation
   expenses when they are supporting the recovery of a US NMC aircraft. Again, cost estimates
   are acceptable until true costs are determined. The AMC unit requesting transportation must
   identify the funds, and obligate those funds as appropriate. ACSA forms are accomplished
   IAW Figure 9.2 and associated instructions.
9.6. Financial Guidance. Direct costs of logistics exchanges to recover NMC aircraft are
reimbursable either by cash or by RIK. The requesting nation/commander must have funding
authority and the knowledge that funds are available to make payments within 60 days of
receiving an invoice document.
   9.6.1. USAF units will never request support without the means to fund the support. The
   requesting unit must identify a funding POC to ensure funds are available, and then obligated
   via local FM guidance.
   9.6.2. Both nations are bound to reciprocal pricing, meaning, each party to an ACSA
   transaction will only bill at the exact cost charged to the forces of their own
   nation/organization. USAF commanders may provide non-reimbursable support (use of hand
   tools, testers, and other ground support equipment, etc.) when there are no financial impacts
 40                                                                                   AMCI21-108 16 DECEMBER 2011


     or additive costs to the DOD. Additionally, AFI 10-1801, Foreign Governmental Aircraft
     Landings at United States Air Force Installations, also identifies non-reimbursable routine
     port services. However, any support that incurs additive costs to the DOD must be
     reimbursed using the reciprocal costing principle.
     9.6.3. AMC providing unit resource advisors must reconcile all cash ACSA forms (either
     paying or receiving payment) with their local/applicable finance agency. The finance office
     will instruct unit resource managers on the proper procedures.         Applicable financial
     guidance can be found in DOD FMR, 7000.14, Volume 11A, Reimbursable Operations
     Policy and Procedures, Chapters 1 and 8, AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and
     Procedures, and AMCI 65-602, TWCF Budget Guidance and Procedures.. Reimbursement
     to providing units should occur within 60 days but can take much longer.
            9.6.3.1. RIK ACSA forms are not processed through finance. These reimbursement
            transactions actions are processed and tracked by the providing unit and HQ
            AMC/A4RXP.
     9.6.4. AMC/A4RXP must receive final copies of all ACSA order forms for tracking
     purposes and data entry to AGATRS, the ACSA system of record. Send completed forms to
     AMC.A4.A4.RX@scott.af.mil, DSN 312-779-2947. Direct any ACSA related questions to
     A4RXP during duty hours.       For assistance after duty hours, contact 618 AOC
     (TACC)/XOCL).
     9.6.5. Units requiring reimbursement or needing to pay via RIK or cash must notify
     AMC/A4RXP when payments are made or reimbursed. This applies to cash and RIK
     payments.
     9.6.6. US units operating abroad and considering support from another C-17 Virtual Fleet
     nation or organization will initiate those requests via the local foreign leadership on location
     or by using the contact information contained in Table 9.2.

   AMC OCONUS POST ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION WRECKAGE RECOVERY
                           CHECKLIST

Figure A3.1. AMC OCONUS Post Accident Investigation Wreckage Recovery Checklist
  Date                       Action                       AMC OPR      Remarks
Complete
I. Confirm Following Actions Completed Prior to Wreckage Recovery
           1. AMC Identified as basic command to          A4M; SE
           which aerospace vehicle is assigned.
           Reference: AFI 16-402; AFI 21-103
           2. Coordinate with National                    SE
           Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) for
           mishaps between AF and civil aircraft
           occurring within US jurisdiction. Mishaps
           between AF and civil aircraft occurring
           outside of the US are investigated under
           the provisions of Annex 13 to the
           Convention on International Civil
           Aviation. The NTSB investigates all
           accidents involving civil aircraft within US
           jurisdiction (AF may conduct concurrent
           investigation and/or have representation
           during NTSB investigation). Reference:
           AFI 91-204
           3. The investigation of AF accidents that      JA
           occur in foreign territory, or those that
           involve any civil or foreign military
           aircraft, may be affected by treaties,
           statutes, regulations, agreements, and other
           procedures. For accidents occurring on
           foreign territory, the Staff Judge Advocate
           (SJA) of the AF MAJCOM or component
           responsible for air operations in that
           country or AOR should be consulted. For
           AF accidents involving any civil or foreign
           military aircraft in the US, consult
           AFLSA/JACT for guidance regarding the
           scope and nature of AF involvement in the
           investigation. Reference: AFI 51-503,
           Aerospace Accident Investigations
 50                                                         AMCI21-108 16 DECEMBER 2011



           4. At the On-Scene Commander's discretion,       SE, JA
           custody of the wreckage should be
           transferred to the SIB President. The SIB
           President then transfers custody of the
           wreckage to the AIB President. After the
           wreckage is no longer required for the AIB
           investigation, the AIB President transfers
           custody of the wreckage to the host
           installation commander. Reference: AFI 51-
           503
           5. The host installation commander is            A4, JA
           responsible for removing and storing the
           wreckage. If the host installation does not
           have the capability for removing and
           storing the wreckage, then the convening
           authority will assist in removing and
           storing the wreckage. The convening
           authority pays all costs associated with the
           removal and storage of the wreckage.
           Reference: AFI 51-503
II. Wreckage Recovery Actions
           1. Send message to appropriate air attaché'      A4M
           declaring intent by AMC to recover
           wreckage, to facilitate in-country logistics
           support
           2. Request assistance from the U.S. Navy         A4M; SE
           for recovery or salvage of submerged
           wreckage beyond the capabilities of the
           base concerned. Contact Commander,
           Naval Sea Systems command, Attn:
           Supervisor of Salvage (CODE COC).
