                                  SCORING AF FORM 1206

1. (Added) The Score Sheet.
Point scales used do not matter as long as consistency in scoring is used for each heading on the
AF Form 1206. One method to achieve this is to assign a max value to each bullet and use
decimal places in half point increments to further refine your scoring (as needed). An example of
this would be assigning a point value to each bullet under “Leadership and Job Performance in
Primary Duty”. The eight bullets in this section would be worth 10 points each and equate to
80% of the total score. Assign a 5-point value to “Significant Self Improvement” and “Base or
Community Involvement”. The two bullets in each of these sections would be worth 5 points
each and equate to the other 20% of the total score. Similar methodology can be used to score
other nomination packages that have different headings and varying amount of bullets.

2. (Added) Points to Consider When Scoring.
Packages will be accepted at face value. Don’t spend time trying to decide if a package is valid
or not. Obvious factual problems such as dates/times outside the effective date of the award
should be discussed and resolved. Duty performance and leadership are the primary factors in
scoring (worth 80% of the total score). The Air Force considers the whole person important and
certainly wants educated leaders who are involved and leading in the community as well but day
to day duty performance is the key.

Deployment: Do not let the fact that a nominee is deployed influence the vote. Deployments are
important but the key is how the nominee handled their assigned responsibilities, sought self-
improvement and how well they served their communities. If a nomination package covers an
entire year and a deployment was less than six months, there should be significant facts from
home station included in the package.

Career Field: There are no unimportant or insignificant career fields. Consideration should be
given to how well the nominee performed assigned duties. Don’t let biases influence the scoring
process.

Numbers: Raw numbers tell very little. Don’t be swayed by statements like “handled 3,000
shipments” or managed a $5 million contract” unless the bullet states an impact and how it
affected the mission. Look for time saved, money saved, manpower reduced, etc. The writer
must effectively convey the full impact of the work done. Ask yourself “so what?” when reading
each bullet. Are 3,000 shipments more or less than normally expected? Is this an increase over
previous years or does it exceed an established standard? If the “so what?” is lacking then the
bullet is probably not effectively capturing the impact.

Fluff: Weak packages are usually propped up by flowery writing. Look beyond the adjectives,
adverbs, and hyperbole and see if there are any facts to back up the excitement. If they really are
a “Superior NCO with exceptional leadership and mentorship skills” something in the package
should tell you who they led and mentored and the impact they had on these individuals.
Do not let writing style; punctuation, spelling, etc. influence the score. Judgment of the nominee
should be based on performance. Their accomplishments should not be discounted or

overshadowed by poor editing, spelling, etc. This kind of stuff can be cleaned up before sending
the package to the next higher board.

Arrive at the board with packages scored and an open mind. Split resolution discussions are often
lively. Keep in mind that the board is a team working together to make the best possible
selection.
