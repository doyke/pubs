This United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) Instruction implements Air Force Policy
Directive (AFPD) 36-8, Employee Benefits and Entitlements and Work/Life Programs. It
establishes policies and procedures for requesting approval of overtime and compensatory time
for all civilian employees within the directorates and headquarters-level agencies and
organizations, Third Air Force (3 AF), and Seventeenth Air Force (17 AF) only. The purpose of
this instruction is to provide guidance regarding the manner in which the overtime, compensatory
time, and compensatory time for travel are requested and approved. It does not apply to Air
National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units. This instruction
requires collecting and maintaining information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 authorized
by 5 USC 552 (a). System of records notice F065 AF A, Time and Attendance Feeder Records
(October 14, 2003, 68 FR 59167) applies. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in Air Force Records Information Management System
(AFRIMS): https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
2                                                            USAFEI 36-801, 26 MARCH 2009

This document is revised to include coverage for 17 AF, add reference to Department of Defense
Manual (DODM) 1400.25_AFMAN 36-115, National Security Personnel System (NSPS),
SC1930.13 through SC1930.25, for NSPS employees, and addresses the use of compensatory
time off for travel.
1. General: Overtime and compensatory time should be approved in writing and in advance,
whenever possible. Overtime should be utilized for urgent and unexpected workload surges,
such as when unusual, occasional, or seasonal workload must be accomplished within a given
time period and additional personnel are not available, or when performance of overtime work is
more economical than hiring temporary employees or paying for charges or damages that would
otherwise be incurred. Compensatory time is time off in lieu of overtime pay for irregular or
occasional overtime work. Compensatory time off for travel is a separate form of compensatory
time off that may be earned by an employee for time spent in a travel status away from the
employee's official duty station (see section 6.). Credit hours, compensatory time, and
compensatory time for travel are not the same.
2. Responsibilities: Authorizing officials should be aware that they are committing government
funds for overtime. Compensatory time, unused after 1 year, converts to an overtime payment;
thus, incurring additional expenditure of funds. Compensatory time off for travel not used by the
end of the 26th pay period after the pay period during which it was earned is not paid out and is
forfeited.
3. Requesting Official Responsibilities:
    3.1. Plans work effectively and requests overtime only when mission requires this work for
    efficient operations. Considers the alternatives to overtime and compensatory hours as
    outlined in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-802, Pay Setting, Chapter 3.1.2. and AFMAN 36-
    115, NSPS, Chapters SC1930.13 through SC1930.25 for NSPS employees prior to requesting
    the additional hours.
    3.2. Requests overtime and compensatory time on AF Form 428, Request for Overtime,
    Holiday Premium Pay, and Compensatory Time. Fully describes the nature of the duties and
    providing detailed justification for the required overtime (see Attachment 2 for specific
    details on completion of form).
    3.3. Uses one AF Form 428 per pay period. Does not use blanket request extending over
    multiple pay periods. This ensures authorizing officials reassess the need for overtime or
    compensatory hours and reduces misuse and lack of management oversight.
    3.4. Requests approval from authorizing official before directing overtime or compensatory
    hours. Note: In an emergency situation, requestor may obtain verbal approval before
    commencement; however, a written request must be submitted the following workday.
    3.5. Obtains fund verification from the Resource Advisor (RA) after coordinating through
    appropriate authorizing official (two-digit or delegated to three-digit).
    3.6. Provides copy of approved AF Form 428 to the time and attendance certifiers and
    timekeepers for audit purposes.
    3.7. Briefs employees on the number of hours authorized to work overtime and other rules
    and procedures governing compensatory time and overtime.
USAFEI 36-801, 26 MARCH 2009                                                                        3

   3.8. For Non-United States (U.S.) employees, obtains approval in accordance with host
   country policies. Managers should consult with their servicing Civilian Personnel Office for
   advice and guidance.
4. Authorizing Official Responsibilities:
   4.1. For paid overtime or compensatory time, only two-digit officials and their deputies, or
   three-digit-delegates with a formal appointment letter (Attachment 3) outlining the scope of
   the authority, are authorized to approve requests. Note: In an emergency situation, a three-
   digit official, not otherwise delegated such authority, can verbally approve request.
   However, written request must follow the next workday. The delegated authority letter is to
   be kept on file with the appointing official and the timekeeper for the organization.
   4.2. Serves as Accountable Officials as defined in Department of Defense Regulation (DoD)
   7000.14-R, Volume 5, Disbursing Policy and Procedures, Chapter 33, Accountable Officials
   and Certifying Officers, Section 3308, Glossary of Terms, Section 330812, Departmental
   Accountable Officials: “For the purposes of this chapter, individuals who are responsible in
   the performance of their duties for providing to a certifying officer information, data, or
   services that the certifying officer directly relies upon in the certification of vouchers for
   payment. They are pecuniarily liable for erroneous payments resulting from their negligent
   actions in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, Section 2773a, Departmental
   Accountable Officials.
   4.3. After being appointed by their director in writing, authorized officials are required to
   sign a statement that they acknowledge their responsibility and personal liability with regard
   to approving Civilian Pay compensation (see Attachment 3 for sample appointment letter).
5. Resource Advisor Responsibilities:
   5.1. Provides line-of-accounting data and verifies funds availability on approved requests.
   5.2. Ensures correct Responsibility Code/Cost Code (RCCC) is on AF Form 428.
   5.3. Ensures Emergency and Special Programs (ESP) codes are provided for possible
   tracking of expenses or funding reimbursement (Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) exercises or
   contingencies).
   5.4. Provides any other Reimbursable Program Code where an ESP may not be in use. (e.g.;
   Palace Compass, Funding Code (FC) 2S/T, or Military Family Housing (MFH) Operations
   and Maintenance (O&M)).
   5.5. Completes the Journal Voucher should expenditures need to be realigned to capture
   costs to the appropriate Line of Accounting (LOA) or ESP.
   5.6. For Non-U.S. employees, RA will obtain coordination from Financial Management (HQ
   USAFE/FM) on paragraphs 5.1. through 5.5.
6. Compensatory Time for Travel:
   6.1. Time in a travel status includes the time an employee spends traveling between the
   official duty station and a temporary duty station, or between two temporary duty stations,
   and the usual waiting time that precedes or interrupts such travel. Travel time in connection
   with an employee's permanent change of station is not time in a travel status.
4                                                              USAFEI 36-801, 26 MARCH 2009

    6.2. Waiting time: Airline travelers generally are required to arrive at the airport at a
    designated pre-departure time. Such waiting time at the airport is considered usual waiting
    time and is creditable time in a travel status. In addition, time spent at an intervening airport
    waiting for a connecting flight also is creditable time in a travel status. If an employee
    experiences an extended ( i.e., not usual) waiting time between actual periods of travel during
    which the employee is free to rest, sleep, or use the time for his or her own purposes, the
    extended waiting time is not creditable as time in a travel status.
    6.3. Travel involving two or more time zones: When an employee's travel involves two or
    more time zones, the time zone from the point of first departure must be used to determine
    how many hours the employee actually spent in a travel status for the purpose of accruing
    compensatory time off.
    6.4. Employees should request compensatory time off for travel in advance when possible.
    If an employee does not request credit for compensatory time off for travel in advance he/she
    must do so by the end of the pay period following the time in travel status. An employee's
    request for credit of compensatory time off for travel may be denied if the request is not filed
    within this time period. Travel Compensatory Hours will be identified on the employee’s
    time card under “Travel Comp Earned” or “Travel Comp Taken” and the employee must
    provide a copy of their flight itinerary to the time and attendance certifiers and timekeepers
    for audit purposes. Travel Compensatory Hours will be earned and used in 30 minute
    increments.
    6.5. Payment for unused compensatory time off for travel is not authorized under any
    circumstances.
    6.6. Forms Adopted: AF Form 428, Request for Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay, and
    Compensatory Time.

   Adequate Justification—Government Auditing Standards (2003 Revision), GAO-03-673G,
   Government Auditing Standards, for documentation in Chapter 7, Para 7.49., states “A large
6                                                              USAFEI 36-801, 26 MARCH 2009

    part of auditors’ work on an audit concerns obtaining and evaluating evidence that ultimately
    supports their judgments and conclusions pertaining to the audit objectives.” Tests of
    Evidence, Para 7.52., states “Evidence should be sufficient, competent, and relevant to
    support a sound basis for audit findings, conclusions, and recommendations:
    a. Evidence should be sufficient to support the auditors’ findings. In determining the
    sufficiency of evidence, auditors should ensure that enough evidence exists to persuade a
    knowledgeable person of the validity of the findings;
    b. Evidence is competent if it is valid, reliable, and consistent with fact. In assessing the
    competence of evidence, auditors should consider such factors as whether the evidence is
    accurate, authoritative, timely, and authentic;
    c. Evidence is relevant if it has a logical relationship with, and importance to, the issue being
    addressed.”
Compensatory Hours—Compensatory Time is time off with pay in lieu of overtime pay for
irregular or occasional overtime work. Compensatory time reference:
http://www.opm.gov/oca/pay/HTML/COMP.HTM
Compensatory Travel Hours—Public Law 108-411, Section 203 of the Federal Workforce
Flexibility Act of 2004 authorized compensatory travel time for time spent by an employee in a
travel status away from the employee's official duty station when such time is not otherwise
compensable. Title 5 United States Code 5541(2), Pay and Allowances defines who is deemed
employed by an agency.
Overtime—Public law 5 CFR, Part 550, Section 111, Administration of Overtime Pay defines
who is authorized overtime:
    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (d), (f), and (g) of this section, overtime work means
    work in excess of 8 hours in a day or in excess of 40 hours in an administrative workweek
    that is:
       (1) Officially ordered or approved and
       (2) Performed by an employee.
    Hours of work in excess of 8 in a day are not included in computing hours of work in excess
    of 40 hours in an administrative workweek.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, a department shall pay for overtime work at
    the rates.
