                                  OPERATION OF CATHODIC
                                     PROTECTION SYSTEMS

1.1. Maintaining Cathodic Protection Systems requires periodic (recurring)
maintenance to ensure proper operation. The required surveys and intervals
are identified in MIL HDBK 1136, Operation and Maintenance of Cathodic
Protection Systems.

1.2. The Close Interval Corrosion Survey is conducted to ensure that the
entire structure has adequate cathodic protection.

1.2.1. Preferred equipment: Data Logger, Current Interrupters (or
Syncronizable Current Interrupters for impressed current systems with
multiple rectifiers), low frequency pipe locator (120-cps for impressed
current systems), motorized wire wheel or wire dispenser (backpack or hip
pack) and data probe with copper/copper sulfate electrode (figure 1.1).
Figure 1.1. Using Data Logger for Close Interval Survey.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                6

1.2.1.1. Other equipment which may be used includes waveform analyzers
with pulse generators (for impressed current systems with one to 11
rectifiers), or high input resistant DC voltmeter (10 megaohms or higher),
wire reels, intermediate electrode extension, and copper/copper sulfate
electrode.

1.2.2. Check serviceability of reference electrode (half-cell), meters, meter
leads, wire reels, and other equipment.

1.2.3. A systematic approach should be taken to cover the entire structure
with high accuracy for recording locations of potential measurements taken
(table 1.1).

1.2.4. Take required potential measurements.

1.2.4.1. "On" and "instant off" potential measurements must be taken at
intervals not to exceed the depth of the pipeline or structure being tested.

1.2.4.2. Normally, the interval used is kept uniform over the entire structure.

1.2.4.2.1. Take accurate notes to record location information.

1.2.4.2.2. Use pipe locator to ensure measurements are taken directly over
pipelines (figure 1.2).

1.2.5. Locations of all physical structures should be noted, especially when
potential readings can’t be taken due to asphalt or other physical
obstructions.
1.2.5.1. Note exact length of the structure where potential measurements
were not taken.

1.2.5.2. Locations to be noted may include roads, sidewalks, railroads,
valves, pits, buildings, ditches, retaining walls, foreign pipeline crossings,
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               7

test stations, fences, parking lots, waterways, or other significant location,
such as where the structure comes out of the ground for any reason.

Table 1.1. Close Interval Survey Potential Measurement Requirements.
STRUCTURE TYPE            POTENTIAL MEASUREMENT LOCATIONS
   PIPELINES              At intervals not to exceed the depth of the
                          pipeline, normally every 3 to 5 feet
                          Next to the tank every six feet around the tank
   ON GRADE               circumference.
 STORAGE TANKS            At a distance one tank radius away from the tank,
                          at eight equally spaced locations around the tank
                          circumference
                          With the reference cell located:
                          Every three feet over the tank
                          At least every three feet over feed and return
  UNDERGROUND             piping.
 STORAGE TANKS            Over the manhole, fill pipe, and vent pipe
                          Over all metallic structures in the area if readings
                          indicate an isolated system is shorted to a foreign
                          structure.

Pipeline.




1.2.6. Note location of structure connection for all potential measurements.

1.2.6.1. When the structure connection location is changed, it must be
recorded in the data, and a portion of previous readings should be duplicated
to ensure consistency of data (and continuity of the structure).

1.2.6.2. If instant off potential measurements are exactly the same after
moving the structure connection, this may not be required.

1.2.6.3. If instant off potential measurements change significantly when
moving the structure connection, more potentials may need to be taken.

1.2.6.4. This condition should be noted in the data, so that the location can
be re-visited for future testing and troubleshooting.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                 9

1.2.7. Potentials should also be taken on foreign metallic structures, which
cross or are located near the protected structure, especially when a gradient is
observed on the protected structure.

1.2.8. Data should be entered into a computer database and checked for
erroneous readings.

1.2.8.1. Erroneous readings can result from not making good contact to earth
with the reference cell, lifting the reference cell too early or by pressing the
trigger too early.

1.2.8.2. All data should be reviewed for errors when entered into the
database.

1.2.9. Graphing Data: After verification of the data, the data should be
graphed by data base software or by copying the data into a spreadsheet
application. This graphical presentation of the data allows for easy analysis.

1.2.10. Analyzing Data: Presenting the data graphically allows overlay of
criteria lines or curves, which easily identifies areas which do not meet the
criteria for protection.

1.2.10.1. Other anomalies in the data are also easily recognized.

1.2.10.2. Trends, which may not have been apparent when looking at the
potential measurements, will be readily seen on the graphs.

1.2.10.3. Looking at the graph of the data may uncover areas of the structure
where further testing or troubleshooting is required.

1.2.10.4. The data may also be overlaid with previous survey data or future
survey data to allow easy recognition of changes or other anomalies.

1.2.11. Other tests required include anode and rectifier checks shown in table
1.2 (these requirements are detailed in MIL HDBK 1136).
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                             10

1.3. The Corrosion Survey is conducted to reasonably ensure that the entire
structure still has adequate cathodic protection.

1.3.1. Preferred Equipment: Data Logger, Current Interrupters (or
Syncronizable Current Interrupters for impressed current systems with
multiple rectifiers), motorized wire wheel or wire dispenser (backpack or hip
pack) and data probe with copper/copper sulfate electrode (figure 1.3). Other
equipment which may be used includes waveform analyzers with pulse
generators (for impressed current systems with one to 11 rectifiers), or high
input resistant DC voltmeter (10 megaohms or higher), wire reels,
intermediate electrode extension, and copper/ copper sulfate electrode.

1.3.2. Check serviceability of reference electrode (half-cell), meters, meter
leads, wire reels, and other equipment.

1.3.3. Take required potential measurements.

1.3.3.1. Data from the close interval corrosion survey should be analyzed to
determine the best locations for data collection during the corrosion survey.

1.3.3.2. This is normally the low and/or the high potential locations,
according to the trends in that data.

1.3.3.3. If a close interval survey has never been done, it would be wise to
perform the close interval survey in lieu of the corrosion survey.

1.3.3.4. "On" and "instant off" potential measurements must be taken. If data
from a close interval corrosion survey is not available, sufficient test
locations should be selected to ensure that the entire structure is protected.

1.3.3.5. See table 1.3 for general recommendations of potential locations.

1.3.4. Take accurate notes to record location information.

1.3.5. Examine all data collected to ensure erroneous potential measurements
are not included in the database.

1.3.6. Compare measurements to previously recorded data.

1.3.7. Other tests required include anode and rectifier checks shown in table
1.4. These requirements are detailed in MIL HDBK 1136.

                              readings indicate an isolated system is shorted
                              to a foreign structure.

1.4. The Water Tank Calibration is conducted to ensure that the entire
structure has adequate cathodic protection, without the presence of over
voltage, which may damage the coating.

1.4.1. Preferred Equipment: Radios, Data Logger, Current Interrupter, wire
reel, voice activated headsets, inflatable raft, oar, magnetized handle, rope,
submersible adapter, and copper/copper sulfate electrode. Other equipment
which may be used includes waveform analyzer with pulse generator, or high
input resistant DC voltmeter (10 megaohms or higher).

1.4.2. Check serviceability of reference electrode, meters, meter leads, wire
reels, and other equipment.

1.4.2.1. Ensure that reference electrode connection is made with a
submersible adapter, or that it is a water tank reference electrode.

1.4.2.2. Exposure of the copper connection to the water will result in
erroneous measurements.

1.4.3. Take required potential measurements.

1.4.3.1. "On" and "instant off" potential measurements should be taken of
the tank wall, at the surface, midway down the tank, and at the bottom,
adjacent to and between all anode strings.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                14

1.4.3.2. The tank bottom should have potential measurements taken directly
below tank wall anode strings, stub anode strings, and between the anode
strings.

1.4.3.3. For elevated towers with "wet" risers, close interval measurements
should be taken near the riser wall for the entire length of the riser (normally
every 2 to 5 feet).

1.4.4. Take accurate notes to record location information.

1.5. The rectifier operational checkout is used to ascertain the serviceability
of all the components necessary to impress current to the anodes of the
impressed current system.

1.5.1. It should be a thorough checkout to ensure dependable current until
the next inspection.

1.5.2. This checkout should be accomplished in conjunction with the close
interval corrosion survey, the corrosion survey, the water tank calibration, or
when any inspection or survey indicates that problems with the rectifier may
exist.

1.5.3. Preferred Equipment: Handheld multimeter with AC, DC, ohms, and
diode circuits and suitable test leads.

1.5.4. The rectifier operational checkout should include the following:
Visual check of all rectifier components, shunt box components, safety
switches, circuit breakers and other system power components.

1.5.4.1. Tightening of all accessible connections and temperature check of
all components.

1.5.4.2. Check serviceability of meters, meter leads, and other equipment.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                           15

1.5.4.3. Measure the output voltage and current and calibrate the rectifier
meters, if present (figures 1.4 and 1.5).

1.5.4.4. For rectifiers with more than one circuit, measure the output voltage
and current for additional circuit(s), and calibrate other rectifier meters, if
present.

1.5.4.5. For rectifiers with potential voltmeters, measure and calibrate each
meter. Using a known good reference electrode, measure the potential
difference to the installed permanent reference electrode.

1.5.5. Calculate the cathodic protection system circuit resistance of each
circuit, by dividing the rectifier DC voltage output of each circuit by the
rectifier DC ampere output for that circuit.

1.5.6. For all Close Interval Corrosion Surveys or if otherwise required,
calculate the rectifier efficiency.

1.6. The impressed current anode bed survey is a non-interrupted survey of
the ground bed to determine the condition of the anodes and is performed to

ensure that the current output of the system is still sufficient.

1.7.1. Preferred Equipment: High input resistant DC voltmeter (10
megaohms or higher), wire reel, and a copper/copper sulfate electrode.
Other equipment that may be used includes Data Loggers with data probes,
waveform analyzers, or handheld multimeter with AC, DC, ohms and diode

1.7.2. The following are the recommended minimum requirements for
conducting an impressed current system check.

1.7.2.1. Check serviceability of meters, meter leads, and other equipment.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               18

1.7.2.2. Measure rectifier DC voltage and DC ampere outputs.

1.7.2.3. Calculate the rectifier system circuit resistance by dividing the
rectifier DC output voltage by the rectifier DC output current. If the rectifier
has more than one circuit, calculate the resistance of each circuit.

1.7.2.4. Take potential measurements at the locations of the three lowest and
the highest potential measurements identified in the most recent close interval
or corrosion survey.

1.7.2.5. Compare the potential measurements and the DC ampere output of
the rectifier to the last close interval or corrosion survey.

1.7.2.5.1. If potential measurements do not meet criteria, and the rectifier
current output does not meet the current requirement from the last survey,
adjust the CP system to that level and repeat testing.

1.7.2.5.2. If potential measurements do not meet the criteria, and the rectifier
current output meets the current requirement from the last survey, adjust or
supplement the CP system as necessary and repeat testing. Conduct a
corrosion survey 30 days after adjustment or modification to the cathodic
protection system to establish the new current requirement.

condition. The checkout is normally conducted as part of the close interval or
corrosion survey.

1.8.1. Preferred Equipment: High input resistant DC voltmeter (10
megaohms or higher), wire reel, and a copper/copper sulfate electrode.

1.9.2.5. Compare to previous measurements to determine if changes have
occurred.

1.9.3. If the potential measurements, current flow, current direction or other
measurement has changed from the last check, adjust or repair the component
as necessary, and repeat the test of the bond.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                 21

1.10. The leak survey is performed to determine the cause of the leak and to
determine the corrective action required in preventing future leaks.

1.10.1. Preferred Equipment: High input resistant DC voltmeter (10
megaohms or higher), wire reel, antimony half-cell and a copper/copper
sulfate electrode. Other equipment that may be used includes data loggers
with data probes, waveform analyzers, or handheld multimeter (10
megaohms or higher input resistance).

1.10.2. Check serviceability of meters, meter leads, and other equipment.

1.10.3. Measure the potential with the reference electrode near the surface of
the structure.

1.10.4. Measure the pH of the electrolyte near the surface of the structure.

1.10.5. Perform a visual inspection of the structure coating and note its
condition.

1.10.6. Inspect the structure surface at and around the point of the leak.

1.10.6.1. Determine corrosion caused or contributed to the failure.

1.10.6.2. If corrosion caused the failure, examine corrosion to determine the
type of corrosion (see MIL HDBK 1136, chapter 2 for types of corrosion)
which caused the failure (galvanic, interference, oxygen concentration, etc.).

1.10.7. If structure is under cathodic protection, conduct a checkout of that
system and perform a corrosion survey of the structure affected by that
system.

1.10.8. Determine the corrective action required in preventing future leaks
on the structure.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                              22

1.11. Records must be kept on file for all structures with cathodic protection
systems.

1.11.1. All surveys included in this section should be filed in a folder for
that specific cathodic protection system.

1.11.2. All these records are instrumental for future operations, maintenance
and testing of cathodic protection systems and protected structures.

1.11.3. Historical data expedites troubleshooting of cathodic protection
systems, should that requirement become necessary.

1.11.4. Historical data is necessary to maintain the infrastructure at its
lowest life cycle cost.

1.11.5. This data is instrumental in planning and installing new or
replacement structures.

1.11.6. Military policy, regulations, instructions and other requirements
mandate these records to be maintained.

1.11.7. In some cases public law requires these records to be maintained for
specific intervals.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                  23



                                               CHAPTER 2
                               MAINTENANCE OF CP SYSTEMS
2.1. CP Systems require unscheduled maintenance to repair systems when
they are not operating properly.

2.1.1. Detailed procedures can be found in MIL HDBK 1136, Chapter 5,
Unscheduled Maintenance Requirements.

2.1.2. If adequate CP does not exist on the protected structure, then
troubleshooting must be accomplished to determine the cause of this lack of
protective current. The first step in troubleshooting is to determine which
component is faulty.

2.1.3. Isolation of problems on Impressed Current CP Systems is
accomplished by testing performed at the power source, normally the rectifier
(and the dielectrics on isolated systems).

2.1.4. In galvanic systems, troubleshooting from the test stations (and
dielectrics on isolated systems) will identify the component that has failed.

2.1.5. Impressed current systems have a large number of components that
may fail.

2.1.6. Galvanic systems are normally trouble free, until anode life has been
reached.

2.2. Troubleshooting Impressed Current CP Systems begins at the power
source, normally a rectifier. For automatic rectifiers, see paragraph 2.2.20.

2.2.1. Visually check rectifier for abnormal conditions.

2.2.2. Measure the DC voltage output (Negative to Positive terminals).
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               24

2.2.3. Measure the DC current output of the rectifier using one of the
following methods (in order of accuracy):

2.2.3.1. Using a clamp-on direct current milliammeter.

2.2.3.2. Measuring MV drop across a calibrated shunt with multimeter set
on mV and multiplying by the proper multiplier (see table 2.1).

Table 2.1. Shunt Multiplication Factors.
        Shunt size         Multiplier        Shunt size         Multiplier

   50 mV / 35 Amp             .7        50 mV / 75 Amp            1.5
   50 mV / 40 Amp             .8        50 mV / 100 Amp           2

2.2.4. Disconnect positive (anode) lead and using an ammeter in series.

2.2.5. Compare those measurements to previous readings taken during
normal operation.

2.2.6. Categorize the readings as high, normal, half of normal, low, or at or
near zero.

2.2.7. Use table 2.2 to determine possible problems and take the actions
required to isolate the problem.
2.2.8. Loss of structure isolation is the most common reason of low
potentials with normal or high rectifier output.
2.2.8.1. Check potentials on both sides of dielectrics. Higher than normal
potentials on the house side of the dielectrics indicate a short somewhere in
the system.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                 25

2.2.8.1.1. Check all installed dielectrics.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               26


2.2.8.1.2. If all dielectrics check good, look for new services, shorts around
dielectrics, current pickup on foreign structures, and/or underground shorts
by conducting over-the-line survey using Audio Frequency (or 120-Cps) pipe
locator or cell-to-cell procedures.

2.2.8.1.3. Low potentials on house side of the dielectrics indicates other
problems.

2.2.9. For systems that are not isolated, the most common reason of low
potentials with normal rectifier output, is a change in the amount of structure
protected. This may also occur on isolated structures.

2.2.9.1. Check for changes to the structure (additions or changes to the
utility system).

2.2.9.2. Check for new projects which may affect the structure (other new
utilities which may be shorted to the structure).

2.2.9.3. Visually check right-of-way for new construction.

2.2.10. Failure of structure coating will cause current requirements to go up.

2.2.10.1. Check for construction near structure that may have damaged
coating.

2.2.10.2. Raise output and verify proper potentials.

2.2.11. Error of installed meters may indicate low output, even though
output is normal.

2.2.11.1. Adjust installed meters to proper reading.

2.2.11.2. Replace defective meters.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               27

2.2.12. Drying of anodes raises circuit resistance, and lowers current.

2.2.12.1. Compare soil conditions to those during previous readings.

2.2.12.1.1. If potentials do not meet criteria because the soil around the
anodes has dried out, do not adjust rectifier.

2.2.12.1.2. Anodes are normally deeper than the structure. If anodes are
dried out, then the structure is also dried out, lowering the corrosion rate.

2.2.12.1.3. Subsequent wetting of soil could damage system or cause
excessive output.

2.2.12.1.4. If potentials still meet criteria, annotate reading, do not adjust
rectifier.

2.2.13. Before a great deal of time is expended troubleshooting an anode
bed, it should be determined from records if there is sufficient anode material
to attempt locating and repairing the fault.

2.2.13.1. If a gradual failure occurred, deterioration of one or more anodes
can be expected. If the failure was sudden, a cable break or loss of one or
more anodes can be expected. If no anodes are operating, see paragraph
2.2.14.

2.2.13.2. If system permits, measure current output of individual anodes.

2.2.13.3. Perform an anode bed plot.

2.2.13.3.1. Connect positive meter lead to rectifier negative.

2.2.13.3.2. Connect negative meter lead to reference cell.

2.2.13.3.3. Perform a close interval survey over entire length of anode bed
(1 or 2 ft intervals).
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                 28

2.2.13.3.4. Graph results to visualize gradients.

2.2.13.3.5. Examine gradients to identify specific problem(s).

2.2.13.4. If a failed anode is indicated, replace the anode.

2.2.13.5. If a broken anode lead is indicated:

2.2.13.5.1. Look for any excavations which have occurred in the area of the
anode cable.

2.2.13.5.2. Use audio frequency pipe locator or fault detector to locate break
in cable.

2.2.13.5.3. Repair the cable.

2.2.14. If no anodes are operational:

2.2.14.1. Use the fault detector and cable locator.

2.2.14.1.1. Connected signal generator directly to the anode cable at the
rectifier.

2.2.14.1.2. Use a low resistance, isolated ground for signal generator.

2.2.14.1.3. Trace the anode lead from the rectifier towards the anode bed.
Repair break.

2.2.14.2. An alternative method is to locate the first anode (from drawings,
markers, or induction methods) (figure 2.1).

2.2.14.2.1. Excavate to the first anode.

2.2.14.2.2. Measure continuity back to the rectifier using a Multi-
Combination meter continuity check circuit.

2.2.14.2.3. Connect signal generator directly to the anode cable at the anode.

2.2.14.2.4. Use a low resistance, isolated ground for the signal generator.

2.2.14.2.5. Use the fault detector and cable locator to trace the anode lead
from the anode towards the rectifier.

2.2.14.2.6. If this is still unsuccessful, replace the anode lead from the
rectifier to the first anode.

Figure 2.1. Using Induction Method to Locate Anodes.




2.2.15. For anodes in water tanks, if the water level goes down, anodes will
no longer be in contact with the electrolyte. If the water level is below all
anodes, no current will flow.

2.2.15.1. Check water level gauge.

2.2.15.2. Visually check water level of tank if doubt still exists.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               30

2.2.16. Loss of rectifier AC input is a common problem with impressed
current systems.

2.2.16.1. Check for AC voltage at rectifier taps (figure 2.2). If AC is present
go to paragraph 2.2.17.

2.2.16.2. Check for tripped circuit breaker. Check AC fuse(s).

2.2.18.2. Check anode leads.

2.2.18.2.1. Check continuity of anode lead to structure, negative terminal
and grounded rectifier case.

2.2.18.2.2. If continuity is found, visually check wiring. Disconnect any
connections, and retest to narrow search.

2.2.18.3. Check if anodes are contacting the structure. Visually check
anodes in water tanks to see if they are contacting structure.

2.2.18.4. Improper size fuse installed.

2.2.18.4.1. Determine proper size of fuse by one of the following: Check
rectifier rated output., review records or calculate current.

2.2.18.4.2. Install proper size fuse. If proper size fuse still fails, repeat tests
in paragraph 2.2.18.

2.2.19. Perform a visual check of the rectifier cabinet.

2.2.19.1. Air flow in cabinet may be restricted by dirt, nests, other foreign
materials.

2.2.19.2. Excessive coating on cabinet can reduce heat transfer, especially in
very hot environments.

2.2.19.3. Excessive heat in rectifier may damage rectifier components,
especially semi-conductors (such as stack diodes or circuitry in automatic
rectifiers.

2.2.20. Special Considerations for Automatic Rectifiers.

2.2.20.1. Switch rectifier to manual operation.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               34

2.2.20.2. Check accuracy of permanent reference electrode with known
good reference electrode.

2.2.20.3. If proper output is not restored, troubleshoot as per table 2.2.

2.2.20.4. Automatic rectifiers can adjust current only to the maximum
setting of the manual taps. If current is too low, tap settings may have to be
adjusted.

2.2.20.5. If proper output is restored:

2.2.20.5.1. And automatic operation is not required (fire protection tank or
tank where there is only minor water level fluctuation) continue operation in
manual mode.

2.2.20.5.2. And automatic operation is required (water tank where the water
level constantly changes), troubleshoot automatic circuit. If automatic circuit
is on a removable card, replace card with troubleshooting card (if supplied)
or replacement card (spare, if available) and retest. See rectifier operating
manual for troubleshooting procedures.

2.3.4. Rectifier stack failure, see paragraph 2.2.17.

2.3.5. Loss of structure isolation, see paragraph 2.2.8.

2.3.6. Failure of automatic rectifier operation, see paragraph 2.2.20.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                              35

2.4. Troubleshooting Galvanic (Sacrificial) CP Systems. The most
common problem encountered in galvanic anode systems is the loss of
structure isolation.

2.4.1. Check potentials on both sides of dielectrics.

2.4.1.2. Higher than normal potentials on the house (unprotected) side of the
dielectrics indicate a short somewhere in the system.

2.4.1.2.1. Check all installed dielectrics using a suitable isolation tester
(such as the gas electronics model 601) (figure 2.5).

2.4.1.2.2. If all dielectrics check good, look for new services, shorts around
dielectrics, current pickup on foreign structures, and/or underground shorts
by conducting over-the-line survey using 120-cps pipe locator or cell-to-cell
procedures.

Figure 2.5. Checking Potentials on Installed Dielectrics.




2.4.1.2.3. Low potentials on the house side of all dielectrics is normal and
indicates good isolation. Other problems are causing the loss of protection.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                             36


2.4.2. Before a great deal of time is expended troubleshooting galvanic
anode systems, it should be determined from records if there is sufficient
anode material to attempt locating and repairing the fault(s).

2.4.2.1. When galvanic anodes begin to fail due to normal consumption,
replacement of the CP system should be programmed.

2.4.2.2. Usually, the most cost-effective method of replacing an entire
galvanic anode system is by installation of an impressed current system.

2.4.3. If a gradual failure occurred, deterioration of one or more anodes can
be expected.

2.4.4. If the failure was sudden, a cable break can be expected. This is most
common when anodes are installed on a continuous header cable, and
connected to the structure at a test station.

2.4.4.1. Perform an anode bed survey.

2.4.4.1.1. Connect negative meter lead to reference cell.

2.4.4.1.2. Disconnect anode. Connect positive meter lead to the anode lead.
Measure potential with reference cell over the anode. Measure anode output
current.

2.4.4.1.3. If anode cannot be disconnected, connect positive meter lead to the
structure. Measure potential with reference cell over the anode. Measure
potential with reference cell over the structure, adjacent to anode and midway
between anodes.

2.4.4.1.4. Compare to previous readings for any changes.

2.4.5. If a cable break is indicated.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                37

2.4.5.1. Look for any excavations which have occurred in the area of the
anode cable.

2.4.5.2. Use an Audio Frequency pipe locator or fault detector.

2.4.5.2.1. Install transmitter by the direct connection method.

2.4.5.2.2. Ensure a remote low resistance ground for the transmitter.

2.4.5.2.3. Locate the cable break.

2.4.5.3. Repair the cable.

2.4.6. If a failed anode is indicated, replace the anode, unless general failure
of all anodes can be expected (see above).
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               38

                                             CP TEST PROCEDURES
3.1. CP Test Procedures. Potential measurement is the fundamental test
procedure used in CP testing.

3.2. Potential Measurement.

3.2.1. The theory is to measure an unknown potential by relating it to a
known reference electrode.

3.2.1.1. In soil and fresh water conditions the copper/copper sulfate reference
electrode should be used.

3.2.1.2. In salt water conditions the silver/silver chloride reference electrode
must be used.

3.2.2. A high input impedance voltmeter must be used to prevent erroneous
readings.

3.2.2.1. The voltmeter must have a minimum of 10 megohms input
resistance under normal conditions.

3.2.2.2. Under rocky or very dry conditions the voltmeter should have up to
200 million ohms input resistance.

3.2.3. Meter connection.

3.2.3.1. Digital Meters (figure 3.1).

3.2.3.1.1. Connect negative lead to reference electrode.

3.2.3.1.2. Connect positive lead to structure. Do not use a current carrying
conductor for meter connection.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                           39

3.2.3.2. Voltmeter which has a D’Arsonval movement needle and has a
polarity switch (such as the M.C. Miller Model B3 Series).

3.2.3.2.1. Select (-) on polarity switch.

3.2.3.2.2. Connect negative lead to reference electrode.

3.2.3.2.3. Connect positive lead to structure. Do not use a current carrying
conductor for meter connection.

Figure 3.1. Taking a Potential Measurement with a High Input
Impedance Digital Voltmeter.




3.2.3.3. Voltmeter which has a D’Arsonval movement (needle) which only
deflects in the positive direction.

3.2.3.3.1. Connect negative lead to structure.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                40

3.2.3.3.2. Connect positive lead to reference electrode. Do not use a current
carrying conductor for meter connection.

3.2.3.3.3. Note that connections must be made backwards to prevent damage
to the meter. Interpret the positive deflection as a negative reading.

3.2.4. Five sources of error.

3.2.4.1. The accuracy of the reference electrode used can be a source of
erroneous readings.

3.2.4.1.1. Check the accuracy of the reference electrode (half-cell) used to
take potential measurements. To determine the accuracy of a reference
electrode multiple reference electrodes must be used. Use one reference
electrode, which is not used in the field, to check against other reference
electrodes.

3.2.4.1.2. A valid reference electrode must be used to take all potential
measurements. Temperature also effects the potential of the reference cell.
Direct sunlight also effects the potential of the reference cell.
3.2.4.1.3. For the full procedures on initiation of a reference electrode,
cleaning of the electrode, preparing the electrolyte solution, and testing of the
reference electrode, see MIL HDBK 1136.
3.2.4.2. IR is error present when current is flowing. Recognize that all "ON"
readings contain this error.
3.2.4.3. Anode gradient field is present when current is flowing. Recognize
that all "ON" readings taken in the gradient field of an anode, contain this
error.
3.2.4.4. Contact resistance error. When the reference electrode is not in good
contact with the electrolyte this error will result in a low reading. Use water
to lower contact resistance (figure 3.2) or select higher input impedance. If
reading changes, select even higher input impedance. Continue until no
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               41

change in reading occurs. Use formula to calculate approximate reading if
required.

Figure 3.2. Using Water to Lower Contact Resistance.




3.2.4.5. Potential measurement being influenced by foreign structures or
different parts of the same structure (mixed potentials).

3.2.4.5.1. This occurs on all structures, where in the influence of potential
gradients from other parts of the same structure.
      Part of structure in concrete.
      Part of structure in different type or aeration of soil.
      Part of structure made of different metals.
         Dresser couplings.
         Galvanized or high strength steel connector or elbow.
3.2.4.5.2. This occurs on all non-isolated structures, where in the influence of
potential gradients from other structures. Recognize this error when near
other structures. For example, copper, cast iron, or galvanized piping or
grounds.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                42

3.2.4.6. For full details about these five errors, see MIL HDBK 1136.

3.3. Practical Measurement of CP Potentials. The method used for
potential testing varies widely for different types of structures and for the
different criteria used for evaluation of the potentials taken. Sometimes
different criteria may be used for different areas on the same structure.

3.3.1. The test method used depends first on the criteria which is being used
to evaluate the adequacy of the CP applied to the structure. The criteria
selected depends mostly on the type of the structure; isolation/non-isolation
of the structure; structure coating type and efficiency; the type of CP system;
the soil resistivity; the amount of current supplied by the CP system, and the
instrumentation available for testing.

3.3.2. Galvanic CP System Criteria Selection: Generally, the criteria
normally used is the -0.85 on criteria. Galvanic systems are normally used in
low soil resistivities, with a low current requirement, very small driving
voltage, and have a very small amount of current flow.

3.3.2.1. Consideration of the IR error must be made.
3.3.2.1.1. This is usually accomplished by placement of the reference
electrode as near to the structure as possible (directly over the pipeline or
tank) and as remote as possible from any galvanic anode.
3.3.2.1.2. This, combined with knowledge of the structure coating, soil
resistivity, the size and spacing of the anodes and the anode current, is usually
sufficient in determining the adequacy of the CP applied to the structure.
3.3.2.1.3. If doubt exists, or for questionable potential readings, use other
criteria or excavate to allow the reference electrode to be placed as close as
practical to the structure to further minimize IR error.
3.3.2.2. Use alternative criteria if
3.3.2.2.1. The dielectric strength of the structure coating is not good.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                43

3.3.2.2.2. The soil resistivity is relatively high.

3.3.2.2.3. The location or spacing of the anodes makes it impossible to
measure the structure potential remote from the anodes.

3.3.2.3. For very small and well coated structures (such as valves, elbows,
tie-downs, etc.), the 100 mV polarization criteria should be used.

3.3.2.4. If the system is designed to allow interrupting the current from all
anodes simultaneously, the 100 mV polarization criteria should be used.

3.3.2.5. The -0.85 instant off criteria is not attainable in many soil conditions
with galvanic anodes.

3.3.2.5.1. Unless the native potential of the structure is very high and/or the
soil resistivity is very low.

3.3.2.5.2. The -0.85 instant off criteria should not be used for galvanic CP
systems except in rare cases. The 100 mV shift criteria or the -0.85 on
criteria (considering IR) should be used.

3.3.3. Impressed Current CP System Criteria Selection.

3.3.3.1. For distributed anode impressed current systems:

3.3.3.1.1. The 100 mV polarization criteria may be the easiest to use.

3.3.3.1.2. The -0.85 instant off may be used.

3.3.3.1.3. The -0.85 on criteria (considering IR) should not be used.

3.3.3.2. For remote anode impressed current systems:

3.3.3.2.1. Any criteria, or a mixture of criteria may be used.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               44

3.3.3.2.2. For structures with a high dielectric strength coating, the -0.85
instant off criteria may be the easiest to use; the 100 mV polarization criteria
may be used. The -0.85 on criteria (considering IR) should not be used.

3.3.3.2.3. For structures which are bare, poorly coated, or have a deteriorated
coating, the 100 mV polarization criteria may be the easiest to use; the -0.85
instant off criteria may be used. The -0.85 on criteria (considering IR) should
not be used.

3.3.3.2.4. If the electrolyte resistivity is low, the dielectric strength of the
coating is high, and the circuit resistance of the CP system is low. The -0.85
on criteria (considering IR error) is sufficient. Consideration of the IR error
must be made. This is usually accomplished by placement of the reference
electrode as near to the structure as possible (directly over the pipeline or
tank). This, combined with knowledge of the structure coating, soil
resistivity, the size and location of the anodes, and amount of anode current,
is sufficient in determining the adequacy of the CP applied to the structure. If
doubt exists, or for questionable potential readings, use other criteria or
excavate to allow the reference electrode to be placed as close as practical to
the structure to further minimize IR error.

3.3.4. Test Methods for the -0.85 on criteria:

3.3.4.1. A single electrode potential survey is conducted using any high
impedance or high input resistant voltmeter (10 megaohms or higher) or data
logger.
3.3.4.1.1. Connect meter as previously described.
3.3.4.1.2. Use proper reference electrode as previously described.
3.3.4.1.3. See paragraph 3.4 for information and potential measurement
limits.
3.3.4.2. Since these potential readings are taken with the CP current on, there
are errors in the measurement which must be considered to obtain a valid
conclusion that adequate CP.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               45

3.3.4.3. Consideration is understood to mean the application of sound
engineering practice in determining the significance of voltage drops by
methods such as:

3.3.4.3.1. Measuring or calculating the voltage drop(s).

3.3.4.3.2. Reviewing the historical performance of the CP system.

3.3.4.3.3. Evaluating the physical and electrical characteristics of the pipe
and its environment.

3.3.4.3.4. Determining whether or not there is physical evidence of
corrosion.

3.3.4.4. Also, consideration of all five errors (previously listed) must be
made.

3.3.4.5. Interruption of the CP current does not fall under this criteria, since
that would pertain to the -0.85 instant off or the 100 mV polarization criteria.

3.3.4.6. Measuring or calculating the voltage drop(s) include measuring all
the factors which affect the magnitude of the voltage errors present in the on
reading such as:

3.3.4.6.1. The anode output (rectifier current output).

3.3.4.6.2. The structure coating efficiency.

3.3.4.6.3. The location of the reference cell in relation to the anodes and the
structure.

3.3.4.6.4. The electrolyte resistivity.

3.3.4.6.5. Comparison to previous potentials (native, on, and/or instant off).
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                              46

3.3.4.7. Implementation of this criteria is only possible when these factors
can be quantitatively verified by measurement or historical evidence that
these factors have been considered.

3.3.4.8. Factors which decrease magnitude of the voltage drop errors or
otherwise reduce the corrosion rate:

3.3.4.8.1. High dielectric strength coating.

3.3.4.8.2. Low electrolyte resistivity.

3.3.4.8.3. High pH (7 to 13), (except lead or aluminum structures).

3.3.4.8.4. Low temperatures lower the corrosion rate.

3.3.4.8.5. Low current density.

3.3.4.8.6. Non-existence of bimetallic connections (isolated structures).

3.3.4.8.7. Non-existence of interference corrosion.

3.3.4.8.8. Shallow and uniform pipe depth.

3.3.5. Test Methods for the -0.85 instant off criteria:

3.3.5.1. This criteria requires the measurement of the potentials when there is
no CP current flowing.

3.3.5.2. For various methods used to measure the instant off potential see
MIL HDBK 1136 section 7.2.5, Instant Off Test Methods which include:

3.3.5.2.1. Simultaneous interruption of all anode current (normally at the
rectifier) and use of a meter which records hi/low readings (or recording
second flash of a digital meter) and manually recording measurements.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                 47

3.3.5.2.2. Simultaneous interruption of all anode current (normally at the
rectifier) and use of a data logger and extracting measurement manually from
the database or by use of appropriate software.

3.3.5.2.3. Use of pulse generators and a waveform analyzer.

3.3.5.2.4. Simultaneous use of a high speed data logger and filtered
oscilloscope to record the potential when the current is at zero.

3.3.5.2.5. If the instant off potential measurement meets or exceeds -0.85
Volts DC (using a copper/copper sulfate reference electrode), this criteria has
been met. Other reference electrodes must be corrected to the factor for a
copper/copper sulfate reference to be valid under this criterion.

3.3.6. Test Methods for the 100 mV polarization criteria:

3.3.6.1. The test method for this criteria is similar to the negative 0.85 instant
off criterion, with the additional requirement of comparing the instant off
reading to a native or depolarized reading.

3.3.6.2. For unprotected isolated structures:

3.3.6.2.1. Perform a thorough native survey and identify the most anodic area
(highest negative) reading.

3.3.6.2.2. Determine the instant off reading required to meet the 100 mV
shift criterion at that point (example, if the most negative reading was -0.625
Volts DC, the instant off would have to be -0.725 Volts DC).

3.3.6.2.3. Apply that instant off criterion to the entire structure.

3.3.6.3. For unprotected structures that are not isolated:
3.3.6.3.1. Perform a thorough native survey and identify the most anodic
areas (highest negative) readings. If those readings are unusually high (over
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               48

-0.700 volts DC), annotate those exact locations; add 100 mV to those
readings; or compare future instant off readings to those specific readings at
those specific locations. If a significant percentage of the pipeline is over -
0.700 Volts DC, consider using the -0.85 instant off criterion for the entire
pipeline.

3.3.6.3.2. Determine the instant off reading required to meet the 100 mV
shift criterion for the rest of the structure (example, if the most negative
reading for the rest of the structure was -0.603 Volts DC, the 100 mV instant
off would have to be -0.703 Volts DC).

3.3.6.3.3. Apply that instant off criteria to the rest of the structure.

3.3.6.4. For protected structures:

3.3.6.4.1. If native survey data is available, analyze data and use procedures
as above for unprotected isolated or non-isolated structures, as appropriate.

3.3.6.4.2. If native survey data is not available, is incomplete or otherwise
not useful, consider using the other criteria.
3.3.6.4.3. To use the 100 mV shift criterion after CP has been applied, the
structure must be depolarized, to obtain an approximation of the native
potential, and use procedures as above for unprotected isolated or non-
isolated structures, as appropriate. After current interruption, considerable
time may be required before the potential returns to an approximation of the
native potential value:
      60 to 90 days for typical well-coated buried structures.
      2 to 30 days for buried structures with poor or no coating.
      90 to 150 days for water tank interiors with good coatings and little or
      no water circulation.
3.3.6.4.4. Certain soil conditions may slow or speed depolarization,
generally, the higher the corrosion rate, the quicker the depolarization occurs.
Some factors, such as high levels of oxygen, movement or agitation of the
electrolyte (flowing water) will speed depolarization. Some factors, such as
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               49

structure coatings, high resistivity soil, low levels of oxygen, and soils which
seal the structure from water and oxygen will slow depolarization.
Considerably more current is required to polarize the structure to a level
where the 100 mV depolarization will occur in a relatively short time period
(seconds or minutes).

3.3.6.4.5. If the instant off potential is 100 mV more negative than the native
potential (or depolarized) potential, this criterion has been met.

3.4. Structure-to-Soil Potential Limits.

3.4.1. Excessive CP current produces hydrogen gas evolution at the surface
of the cathode:

3.4.1.1. If the gas is produced faster than it can permeate out through the
coating, bubbling of the coating will occur.

3.4.1.2. The amount of coating damage is dependent on the amount of gas
generated and the type of coating.
3.4.1.3. The "on" potentials have many errors in the measurement (five
sources of errors previously discussed).
3.4.2. All potentials discussed in this section are in reference to a
copper/copper sulfate reference electrode. For other reference electrodes,
make proper correction to interpret the measurement.
3.4.3. For water storage tanks:
3.4.3.1. Coatings used in water tanks disbond very easily as compared to
coatings used on underground structures.
3.4.3.2. Note that silver/silver chloride reference electrodes potential varies
as the chloride content of the electrolyte changes (reference).
3.4.3.3. "On" potential measurements over -1.10 volts DC could cause
coating damage and "instant off" potentials should be taken (according to the
magnitude of errors in the reading).
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                50

3.4.3.4. "On" potential measurements over -1.50 volts DC should be
expected to cause coating damage and "instant off" potentials must be taken.

3.4.3.5. The instant off potentials must never exceed -1.10 volts DC.

3.4.4. For underground structures:

3.4.4.1. Coatings for underground structures are generally more resistant to
damage from excessive CP current.

3.4.4.2. The only true way to measure the possibility for coating damage is
with an error free measurement (see paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3).

3.4.4.3. Instant off measurements should be used whenever possible:

3.4.4.3.1. Instant off measurements over -1.22 volts DC are not theoretically
possible. Look for other DC current sources.

3.4.4.3.2. Synchronous interruption of all current sources must be
accomplished.

3.4.4.4. For fusion bonded coatings the instant off potentials should not
exceed -1.07 volts DC and must never exceed -1.12 volts DC.

3.4.4.5. For Coal Tar coatings the instant off potentials should not
  exceed
-1.12 volts DC and must never exceed -1.20 volts DC.

3.4.4.6. For Plastic Tape coatings the instant off potentials should not
 exceed -1.02 volts DC and must never exceed -1.07 volts DC.
3.4.4.7. For other coatings refer to specifications for cathodic disbondment
properties compared to above coatings.
3.4.4.8. For uncoated structures there is theoretically no potential limit.
Instant off readings over -1.00 generally waste power and anode material.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               51

3.4.4.9. Table 3.1 assumes an IR drop error and is given for information
only.

3.4.4.9.1. "On" potential should be suspected of coating damage if over the
potentials listed in table 3.1, "SUSPECTED column", and "instant off"
potentials should be taken.

3.4.4.9.2. Coating damage should be expected when the potential
measurement is over the potential listed in table 3.1, "EXPECTED column",
and "instant off" potentials must be taken.

        100,000                     -2.60                   -4.40

3.5. Cell to Cell Potential Testing Procedures.

3.5.1. Cell to cell potential testing is performed to determine the direction of
current flow in the earth:

3.5.1.1. This is especially useful on unprotected pipelines to locate anodic
areas on the pipeline. These procedures are not normally used on protected
structures.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                52

3.5.1.2. On unprotected pipelines when CP of the complete line is not
feasible or economical, “hot spot protection” is sometimes used. This test
procedure is used to identify the anodic areas of the pipeline for application
of CP to those locations.

3.5.1.3. The polarity of the voltage difference between the two reference
cells indicates the direction of current flow.

3.5.2. The accuracy of the reference electrodes (half cells) used to take cell to
cell measurements must be determined:

3.5.2.1. The accuracy of the two half cells is determined by measuring the
difference in potential between the two half cells being used for the test. Use
a suitable high input resistance voltmeter on the millivolt scale, place the two
cells cone to cone, and measure the potential difference. The potential
difference should not be in excess of 5 mV.

3.5.2.2. Perfect matching of the two reference cells is desirable. If perfect
matching is not possible, the error must be accounted for in all measurements
taken.

3.5.2.3. Equal spacing between the reference cells must be made to evaluate
any magnitude differences in measurements.

3.5.2.4. Polarity of the measurements is critical. Notes should be made of all
changes in polarity.

3.6. Rectifier Efficiency Testing Procedures.

3.6.1. The efficiency of a rectifier is determined by:

3.6.1.1. Measuring the output voltage.

3.6.1.2. Measuring output current.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                              53

3.6.1.3. Calculating the input in watts (revolutions per hour of the KWH
meter disc X PF (Power Factor) shown on the face of the KWH meter).

3.6.1.4. And using the following formula:
                           Output Current X Output Voltage
Rectifier Efficiency =
                                         Input Watts
3.6.2. An alternate procedure to determine the rectifier efficiency if there is
no KWH meter or known Power Factor:

3.6.2.1. Measuring the output voltage.

3.6.2.2. Measuring output current.

3.6.2.3. Obtain the input watts is by:

3.6.2.3.1. Measure the AC input voltage.

3.6.2.3.2. Measure the AC input current by using an accurate clamp-on
ammeter (preferred) or disconnecting and measuring with an ammeter.
Assume a PF of 90% and use the following formula:
                              Output Current X Output Voltage
Rectifier Efficiency =
                              Input Current X Input Voltage X .9
3.6.2.4. This method assumes the power factor (usually between 85% and
95%):
3.6.2.4.1. Will not be truly accurate.

3.6.2.4.2. Will give a reasonable approximation.

3.6.2.4.3. If this method is used, subsequent efficiency testing should be
done in the same manner to obtain comparable results.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                54

3.6.2.5. The expected efficiency of a rectifier depends on:

3.6.2.5.1. The type of AC power (Single or Three Phase). Three phase units
are much more efficient.

3.6.2.5.2. The type of rectifying elements (Selenium or Silicon). Silicon
units are more efficient.

3.6.2.5.3. The type of rectifier (Bridge or Center tap).

3.6.2.5.4. The percent of load of the unit. Units are most efficient at full
rated output.

3.6.3. A change in rectifier efficiency indicates problems with the rectifier
unit.

3.7. Dielectric Testing Procedures.

3.7.1. Do not use an ohmmeter to measure resistance of an installed
dielectric:

3.7.1.1. An ohmmeter should never be used on a live circuit. A good
dielectric may have a significant voltage present, and should be considered a
live circuit.
3.7.1.2. If the dielectric is good, and the two sides have a voltage difference,
current will flow through the ohmmeter and could damage the ohmmeter:
3.7.1.2.1. The measurement would not indicate a resistance value because
the voltage difference would be added or subtracted from the internal battery
voltage measured (according to polarity).
3.7.1.2.2. A totally erroneous (or even negative) measurement would result.
3.7.1.3. If the dielectric is good, and the two sides have no significant voltage
difference, there would be little or no current flow through the ohmmeter:
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               55

3.7.1.3.1. The measurement would indicate a sum of the resistance to earth
of the structures on both sides of the dielectric.

3.7.1.3.2. According to the size and coating of the structures involved, this
could be from less than 1 ohm to several thousand ohms, and does not give
any indication of the resistance across the dielectric.

3.7.2. Testing an installed dielectric presents several problems:

3.7.2.1. Since typical installations normally include many dielectrics, all of
which are in a parallel circuit, failure of one dielectric can effectively short
the entire system.

3.7.2.2. There are indications of the shorted condition of one dielectric at
many, or all, other dielectrics installed.

3.7.2.3. Some methods for testing a dielectric look for a voltage difference
across the two sides, which is an indication of that dielectrics condition:

3.7.2.3.1. If voltage is detected, the dielectric is not shorted.

3.7.2.3.2. If voltage is not detected, the dielectric may be shorted. Further
testing is required to verify the condition.

3.7.2.3.3. Use of the headset type of insulation tester (similar to Tinker &
Rasor model "IT"). If tone is heard, voltage is present the dielectric is not
shorted. If tone is not heard, voltage is not detected (see above).

3.7.2.3.4. Use of a multimeter to measure a mV difference. Range should be
on Auto (mV range is typically 300mV, which could easily be exceeded
across a good dielectric). If meter is not auto-ranging, select high range for
initial measurement and change ranges until best resolution is achieved. A
measurement over 10 mV indicates the dielectric is not shorted. A
measurement under 10 mV is inconclusive (see above).
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                              56

3.7.2.3.5. Compass: Place a magnetic type compass on the dielectric. If
compass aligns with the direction of the pipe, voltage is present and the
dielectric is shorted. If compass does not align, voltage is not detected (see
above). Sometimes a 6 or 12 volt battery is connected to the circuit as an
additional voltage difference, and the test repeated.

3.7.2.3.6. Use a clamp-on DC milliammeter with properly sized clamp for
pipeline being tested. Place clamp next to pipe, zero meter, and clamp
around pipe at the dielectric. If measurement is over 10 milliamps, dielectric
is shorted. If measurement is under 10 milliamps, dielectric may not be
shorted.
3.7.2.4. Only one method gives a totally reliable indication of an installed
dielectric (figure 3.3):
Figure 3.3. Using a Radio Frequency Tester.




3.7.2.4.1. The insulated flange tester (radio frequency tester) gives an
accurate indication of the specific dielectric being tested because of its wave
length, the strength of the signal and use of the "skin effect" (most of the
signal travels on the surface of the dielectric).
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                              57

3.7.2.4.2. This method will not read through other parallel paths, even when
these paths are in the immediate vicinity. Therefore, this method should be
used for testing when any other method is not conclusive.

3.7.3. The preferred method to determine if a dielectric may be shorted is by
structure to earth potential testing:

3.7.3.1. This method will provide an immediate indication if the dielectric is
not shorted. At the same time it will provide valuable potential data.
Determine if there may be another dielectric in the area which is shorted.

3.7.3.2. Take a potential measurement of both sides of the installed dielectric
(figure 3.4). Change only the structure connection. Do not move the
reference electrode.

Figure 3.4 Taking Potentials to Test Installed Dielectric.




3.7.3.3. If the two potential measurements are significantly different (over 10
mV), the dielectric is good:
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                58

3.7.3.3.1. The street (protected) side of the dielectric should be at a potential
more negative than -0.85 Volts DC.

3.7.3.3.2. The house (unprotected) side of the dielectric should be between
approximately -0.15 Volts DC and -0.55 Volts DC .

3.7.3.3.3. If the dielectric is good and the house side of the dielectric has a
potential more negative than expected (for example, if the house side
potential reading is over -0.65, with a street side potential more negative),
another shorted dielectric in the area should be suspected. Further
investigation is required.

3.7.3.4. If the two potential measurements are not significantly different
(under 10 mV), the dielectric may be shorted. The insulated flange tester
should be used.
3.7.4. Using insulated flange tester, there are two different type units: Above
Ground Insulator Tester (can also be used to test individual bolts on isolated
flanges) and Buried Insulator Tester. Use each type only for it’s intended
application.
3.7.4.1. There are two different models of each type of insulated flange
tester.
3.7.4.1.1. Tester with "zero"/"test" switch and control knob. Turn Insulated
Flange Tester "zero"/"test" switch to "zero". Turn control knob on. Using
control knob, zero needle indicator to full scale (100). Turn “zero”/”test”
switch to “test”. Without adjusting control knob, test dielectric. You must
make good contact to metal on both sides of the dielectric. No needle
movement indicates good dielectric (stays at full scale). Needle movement
indicates bad dielectric.
3.7.4.1.2. Tester without switch or control knob. To test dielectric, you must
make good contact to metal on both sides of dielectric. For underground
model, hold contact for at least 20 seconds. An audible signal is heard when
test cycle is completed. No change in LCD display and no change in audible
signal indicates good dielectric.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                  59

3.7.4.2. Using a long wave length signal (low frequency) pipe locator:

3.7.4.2.1. Install signal transmitter on pipeline.

3.7.4.2.2. Ensure low resistance isolated ground for transmitter.

3.7.4.2.3. Use pipe locator and attempt to follow signal past dielectric. If
signal stops at dielectric, dielectric may not be shorted. If signal can be
followed past dielectric, dielectric is shorted.

3.7.4.3. Using a fault detector and the signal from an impressed current
system (DC output has a 120-cps component, sometimes called "pulsating
DC").

3.7.4.3.1. This method can only be used with impressed current systems with
a single phase rectifier, and works best with no output choke or filter
(stronger signal).

3.7.4.3.2. Must use a fault detector (such as the Pipe Horn Model 200FDAC)
or a pipe locator (with built in fault detector) capability of following a 120-
cps signal.

3.7.4.3.3. Installation of a current interrupter on the rectifier will ensure that
fault detector is following the impressed current signal. Electrical lines
produce a 120-cps harmonic which can also be followed with a fault detector.

3.7.4.3.4. Use fault detector to follow signal on pipeline to the dielectric.

3.7.4.3.5. Use fault detector and attempt to follow signal past dielectric. If
signal stops at dielectric, dielectric may not be shorted. If signal can be
followed past dielectric, dielectric is shorted.

3.7.4.4. Other methods to make dielectric testing easier:
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                  60

3.7.4.4.1. If possible, merely increase the current level of the existing CP
system. This will serve to increase the difference across good dielectrics,
making it easier to test. This will also increase the signal available for most
other methods of dielectric testing. Repeat the dielectric testing.

3.7.4.4.2. Installation of a temporary local CP system (or battery across
dielectric). This may greatly increase the current to the street side of the
dielectric, making it easier to test. The temporary system should be installed
so that the current will be applied to the location being tested. Repeat the
dielectric testing.

3.7.4.4.3. Use a multi-combination meter, continuity check circuit. Connect
test leads to the meter left terminals. Temporarily short test lead ends
together, turn contact check circuit on, zero needle to full scale, and
disconnect test leads. Connect one test lead to street (protected) side of
dielectric. Connect one test lead to house (unprotected) side of dielectric. A
full scale deflection indicates shorted dielectric. Use insulated flange tester to
verify specific dielectric.
    A deflection of 75% to almost full scale deflection, or deflection past
    100% (or pegged) is inconclusive. Reverse test lead connections: same
    reading indicates there may be a bad dielectric in the area or that the
    dielectric is partially shorted. Use insulated flange tester to verify specific
    dielectric. Opposite side of full scale reading indicates dielectric is good,
    for example, 90% reading, when leads are reversed pegs, or pegged
    reading reversed, reads 90%. Use other test procedure to verify dielectric
    condition.

   Deflection from 30% to 75% is inconclusive. Could be bad dielectric in
   the area. Use other test procedure to verify dielectric condition.
   Deflection under 30% indicates all dielectrics in the area are good
   (structures are isolated).

3.8. Casing Test Procedures.
3.8.1. Testing casings is very similar to testing dielectrics:
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                 61

3.8.1.1. Do not use an ohmmeter to measure between a casing and the carrier
pipeline:

3.8.1.1.1. An ohmmeter should never be used on a live circuit. A good
casing isolation may have a significant voltage present, and should be
considered a live circuit. If the casing isolation is good, current will flow
through the meter and could damage the meter.

3.8.1.1.2. The measurement would not indicate a resistance value. The
voltage difference would be interpreted as coming from the internal battery
instead of the external electrical circuit being measured. A totally erroneous
(or even negative) measurement would result.

3.8.1.2. Shorted casings present serious problems to the application of CP to
the carrier pipe.

3.8.1.2.1. They totally shield the carrier pipeline inside the casing from
receiving any CP.

3.8.1.2.2. They “steal” current which would otherwise protect a large area of
the pipeline outside the casing. Casings are normally not coated (or poorly
coated). Have a relatively low resistance to earth (than the coated carrier
pipeline). Provide a lower resistant path for CP current.

3.8.2. Casing test stations normally have four wires: two to the casing; two
to the carrier pipeline. If there is not a test station already installed, one
should be installed prior to testing. At a minimum, there must be a metallic
connection made to the carrier pipeline and a vent pipe which is connected to
the casing. If there is no vent pipe or carrier pipe test point in the vicinity of
the casing, excavation must be made to the carrier pipeline or the casing, as
required, and test connections made.

3.8.3. Use a suitable insulated flange tester (for testing underground
isolations). Follow the same procedures listed previously for testing a
dielectric.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                              62

3.8.4. Testing a casing with CP on the carrier pipeline:

3.8.4.1. Take a potential measurement of the carrier pipeline.

3.8.4.2. Take a potential measurement of the casing. Do not change the
location of the reference electrode.

3.8.4.3. If the two potential measurements are significantly different (over 10
mV), the casing is not shorted to the pipeline. Under normal conditions the
carrier pipeline should be at a potential more negative than -0.85 Volts DC.
The casing should be between approximately -0.35 and -0.65 Volts DC. If
casing is galvanized, it could be as high as -1.1 Volts DC.

3.8.4.4. If the two potential measurements are not significantly different
(under 10 mV), the casing may be shorted to the pipeline. One of the
following additional tests may be made:

3.8.4.4.1. If possible, increase the current level of the existing system or
install a temporary local CP system to increase the current to the carrier
pipeline. The temporary CP system must be installed on the opposite side of
the crossing from the location of the potential testing. The potential shift
which occurs when the CP system is interrupted may also aid in determining
if the casing is isolated.

3.8.4.4.2. Repeat potential measurement of the carrier pipeline and the
casing. If the potential of the casing shifts positive when the current
increases or turns on, the insulation is good. If the potential of the casing
shifts negative when the current increases or turns on, the casing may be
shorted.

3.8.4.4.3. Use a suitable insulated flange tester (see above).

3.8.5. Testing a casing without CP on the carrier pipeline.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                 63

3.8.5.1. Use an insulated flange tester suitable for testing underground
dielectrics. Follow the same procedures listed previously for testing a
dielectric.

3.8.5.2. Install a temporary local CP system to apply current to the carrier
pipeline. Test the same as the casing with CP on carrier pipeline (see above).

3.8.5.3. Use a multi-combination meter, continuity check circuit.

3.8.5.3.1. Connect test leads to the meter left terminals. Temporarily short
test lead ends together; turn contact check circuit on; zero needle to full scale,
and disconnect test leads.

3.8.5.3.2. Connect one test lead to casing.

3.8.5.3.3. Connect one test lead to carrier pipeline. Full scale deflection
indicates the casing is shorted to the carrier pipeline.
      Deflection of 75% to almost full scale deflection, or deflection past
      100% (or pegged) is inconclusive. Reverse test lead connections. Same
      reading indicates there may be a partial short. Use underground
      insulated flange tester to verify. Opposite side of full scale reading
      indicates casing isolation is good. For example, a 90% reading, when
      leads are reversed, reads over 100% (pegs), or a reading over 100%
      (pegged) when leads are reversed. reads under full scale.
     Deflection from 30% to 75% is inconclusive: could be partial short.
     Reverse leads and test as above. Use other test procedure to verify
     casing condition.

     Deflection under 30% indicates good isolation.

3.9. Testing for a Short Between Two Structures.

3.9.1. Testing for a short is similar to dielectric and casing testing.
3.9.1.1. Do not use an ohmmeter to measure between two structures.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                 64

3.9.1.1.1. An ohmmeter should never be used on a live circuit. Two
structures which are isolated may have a significant voltage difference, and
should be considered a live circuit. If the structures are isolated, current will
flow through the meter and could damage the meter.

3.9.1.1.2. The measurement would not indicate a resistance value. The
voltage would be interpreted by the meter as coming from the internal battery
instead of the external electrical circuit being measured. A totally erroneous
(or even negative) measurement would result.

3.9.1.2. Use a multi-combination meter, continuity check circuit:

3.9.1.2.1. Connect test leads to the meter left terminals. Temporarily short
test lead ends together; turn contact check circuit on; zero needle to full scale,
and disconnect test leads.

3.9.1.2.2. Connect one test lead to casing.

3.9.1.2.3. Connect one test lead to carrier pipeline. Full scale deflection
indicates the two structures are connected.
      Deflection of 75% to almost full scale deflection, or deflection past
      100% (or pegged) is inconclusive. Reverse test lead connections. Same
      reading indicates there may be a partial short between the structures.
      Other testing should be conducted to verify. Opposite side of full scale
      reading indicates structures are isolated. For example a 90% reading,
      when leads are reversed, reads over 100% (pegs), or a reading over
      100% (pegged) when leads are reversed. reads under full scale.

     Deflection from 30% to 75% is inconclusive. Could be a partial short in
     the area. Reverse leads and test as above. Use other test procedure to
     verify.

     Deflection under 30% indicates the structures are isolated.

3.9.2. Testing for a short between two structures with CP on one structure:
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               65

3.9.2.1. Take a potential measurement of both structures. Do not move the
reference electrode.

3.9.2.2. If the two potential measurements are significantly different (over 10
mV), the two structures are not shorted.

3.9.2.2.1. Under normal conditions the structure with CP should be at a
potential more negative than -0.85 Volts DC.

3.9.2.2.2. A steel structure without CP should be between approximately -
0.35 Volts DC and -0.65 Volts DC.

3.9.2.2.3. Copper or steel in concrete structures should have a potential
between approximately -0.20 Volts DC and -0.30 Volts DC.

3.9.2.2.4. Galvanized steel structures which are isolated, could have a
potential as high as -1.10 Volts DC.

3.9.2.2.5. Galvanized steel structures can be shorted to cast iron, brass,
copper or steel structures, resulting in a mixed potential (-.40 to -1.0 Volts
DC).

3.9.2.3. If the two potential readings are not significantly different (under 10
mV):

3.9.2.3.1. The two structures may be shorted. Additional testing is required.
Install a temporary local CP system to increase the current to the protected
structure or, if possible, merely increase the current level of the existing
system.
3.9.2.3.2. Install the temporary system to distribute current to just one
structure.
3.9.2.3.3. Repeat the potential measurement of both structures. If the
potential of the unprotected structure remains approximately the same or
changes in a positive direction (less negative), when the potential of the
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                  66

protected structure changes in a negative direction, they are not shorted. If
both potential measurements change more negative as current is increased,
the two structures are shorted together.

3.9.2.3.4. Interruption of the CP current may make it easier to test continuity.
If the potential of the unprotected structure shifts positive when the rectifier is
interrupted, they are isolated. If the potential of the unprotected structure
shifts negative when the rectifier is interrupted, they may be shorted.

3.9.3. Testing for a short between two structures with CP on both structures.

3.9.3.1. Take a potential measurement of both structures. Do not move the
reference electrode.

3.9.3.2. If the two potential measurements are significantly different (over 10
mV), the two structures are not shorted in the area. Under normal conditions
both structures should be at a potential more negative than -0.85 Volts DC.

3.9.3.3. If the two potential measurements are not significantly different
(under 10 mV).

3.9.3.3.1. The two structures may be shorted. Additional testing is required.

3.9.3.3.2. If one or both of the protected structures have impressed current
systems, turn off the rectifier on one system or install a current interrupter on
one system.
3.9.3.3.3. Repeat the potential measurement of both structures. If structures
are isolated, the structure with the CP current off changes significantly in the
positive direction (less negative). The structure with the CP current still on
remains the same. If structures are shorted, the structure with the CP current
off changes slightly in the positive direction. The structure with the CP
current still on changes slightly in the positive direction.
3.9.3.3.4. If both systems have impressed current systems and a clear
indication of the shorted condition has still not been identified. Repeat
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               67

previous test procedure leaving the other systems rectifier on and repeat
testing. Turn off both rectifiers and use radio frequency insulation tester or
multi-combination meter continuity check circuit (see procedures above).

3.9.4. Testing for a short between two structures without CP on either
structure.

3.9.4.1. Use radio frequency insulation tester (see procedures above).

3.9.4.2. Use multi-combination meter continuity check circuit (see
procedures above).

3.9.4.3. Take a potential measurement of both structures. Do not move the
reference electrode.

3.9.4.4. If the two potential measurements are significantly different (over 10
mV), the two structures are not shorted. Under normal conditions both
structures should be at a potential between approximately -0.35 Volts DC and
-0.65 Volts DC.

3.9.4.5. If the two potential measurements are not significantly different
(under 10 mV).

3.9.4.5.1. The two structures may be shorted. Additional testing is required.

3.9.4.5.2. Install a temporary local CP system to apply current to the one
structure. Repeat the potential measurement of both structures. If structures
are isolated, the structure with the CP current will change significantly in the
negative direction. The structure with no CP current remains approximately
the same. If structures are shorted, both structures change in the negative
direction.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                68

3.10. Current Requirement Testing Procedures.

3.10.1. Current requirement testing is used when planning a CP system
installation. This testing will determine the type and size of the CP system
required.

3.10.2. If the system design requires isolation of the structure to be protected,
that isolation must be accomplished prior to the current requirement test. The
current requirement for a non-isolated structure does not give any indication
of what the current requirement would be if the structure were isolated.

3.10.3. Temporary systems are used to determine the effect of current
applied on the potential of the structure being tested.

3.10.4. Actual protection need not be accomplished to estimate the amount of
current required.

3.10.4.1. Portable rectifiers should be used in conjunction with temporary
anodes (usually ground rods) or existing metallic structures to impress a test
current to the structure.

3.10.4.2. Vehicle batteries can be used, as well as spare rectifiers, DC
generators, DC welding units, or rectifiers from other systems can be
temporarily removed for use.

3.10.5. Temporary local CP systems should be located in areas where the
intended installation is to be located, if known:

3.10.5.1. If not known, they should be located as remote as possible from the
structure to be protected.
3.10.5.1.1. Without any foreign structures in the area of the temporary anode
bed.
3.10.5.1.2. Without any foreign structure between the temporary anode bed
and the structure under test.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               69

3.10.5.2. The area of the temporary installation should be well scouted to
determine if any possible temporary anodes exist or if any foreign structures
are in the area:

3.10.5.2.1. Existing metallic structures, such as metal fences, culverts,
abandoned pipelines, or abandoned wells can be used as temporary anodes or
to supplement installed temporary anodes.

3.10.5.2.2. Do not use any metallic structure for a temporary anode which is
shorted to the structure being tested. Large current surges which can cause
injury to personnel and damage to equipment would result. Test temporary
anode for continuity to structure under test (see testing for continuity between
two structures).

3.10.5.2.3. Do not use active pipelines or tanks for temporary anodes.
Corrosion may occur that could cause leaks.

3.10.5.3. The number of temporary anodes required depends on:

3.10.5.3.1. The available voltage source.

3.10.5.3.2. Availability and size of existing metallic structures which may be
used.

3.10.5.3.3. The size of the structure being tested.

3.10.5.3.4. The coating efficiency of the structure being tested.

3.10.5.3.5. The amount of current desired.

3.10.5.3.6. The resistivity of the soil.

3.10.5.3.7. Generally, temporary anodes should be spaced from 15 to 25 feet
apart. If temporary anodes are close together (0 to 8 feet), will be reduced
benefit from adding additional anodes.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               70

3.10.5.3.8. If the number of anodes is doubled, the amount of current will be
approximately doubled (with adequate spacing).

3.10.5.3.9. If the soil resistivity is doubled, the number of temporary anodes
required is doubled. In very low resistivity soil, two or three temporary
anodes may be sufficient. In very high resistivity soil, a high number of
temporary anodes may be required.

3.10.5.3.10. The better the coating of the structure being tested, the smaller
the number of temporary anodes required. Very well coated structures will
exhibit a noticeable potential change with a small amount of current (1 or 2
amps). Poorly coated structures will not exhibit a noticeable potential change
except with a larger amount of current (10 to 20 amps).

3.10.5.3.11. If the voltage is doubled, the number of temporary anodes
required will be approximately cut in half. If the voltage source is low (6 - 12
volts), more temporary anodes will be required. If the voltage source is high
(60 to 120 volts), fewer temporary anodes are required.

3.10.5.3.12. In dry soil conditions (under 20% moisture), watering the
anodes will lower the resistance (provide more current).

3.10.5.3.13. Streams, ponds, rivers, lakes, bays, oceans or other standing
water make an ideal location for temporary anodes. The temporary anodes
can be simply laid in the water.

3.10.5.3.14. To make temporary anodes, cut 8 or 10 foot ground rods in half.
Sharpen one end. Use a ground rod driver to install into the ground. Use a
ground rod puller to remove from the ground (see MIL HDBK 1136).

3.10.5.3.15. Metallic pipe or conduit may also be used.

3.10.5.3.16. In extreme cases, excavate 6 to 10 foot hole. Push small
diameter steel pipe into the earth with a backhoe or bulldozer. This method
can also be used to attempt to simulate a deeper installation. It is possible to
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                71

install temporary anodes 30 to 60 feet deep in this manner, if no rock
formations are encountered.

3.10.5.4. The temporary anodes must all be connected to the positive
terminal of the power source.

3.10.5.5. The structure being tested must be connected to the negative
terminal of the power source.

3.10.5.6. For physical strength and low resistance, #6 AWG copper cable or
larger must be used. No. 2 AWG or greater is desired, especially if long runs
in either the structure or anode cable is required. Connections can be made
with pipe clamps, ground rod connectors, test clamps, split bolts, and
exothermic welding.        All wire and connections must be made to
accommodate the voltage and current required for the testing.

3.10.5.7. Before any power is applied, it is essential to obtain the as found
potential data of the structure. The native potential must be tested for all
locations to be tested during the current requirement test, to obtain the
potential shift accomplished by the test current.

3.10.5.8. Beginning at a low voltage setting, turn power on. Ensure the
potential shift of the structure is in the negative direction. Gradually increase
voltage and current to desired output. Periodically check potential to ensure a
corresponding negative shift occurs as current is increased. If maximum
voltage is reached and more current is still required, turn system off.
Supplement the temporary anode bed. Consider using multiple power
sources and/or multiple temporary anode beds.

3.10.5.9. Sufficient current is applied when a substantial section of the
structure to be tested has achieved a noticeable potential shift or when full
protection is achieved.

3.10.5.10. If full protection is achieved, the current requirement is the same
as the test current.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                 72

3.10.5.11. If full protection is not achieved, further calculations are required:

3.10.5.12. Once the potential shift is ascertained, and the current to get that
shift is known, approximation of the actual current requirement can be
calculated.

3.10.5.13. If the current is doubled, the potential shift can be expected to
approximately double.

3.10.5.14. Current distribution should be considered. If good current
distribution is achieved, a simple mathematical formula would produce the
current requirement. If proper current distribution is not achieved with the
temporary system, proper current distribution must be considered in the
design.

3.10.5.15. If a current requirement test includes more than one anode bed
location, all current sources should be interrupted simultaneously to measure
the potential shift of the structure:

3.10.5.15.1. The total current requirement is found by adding the current
from all power sources together.

3.10.5.15.2. Always consider proper current distribution and estimate the
required current requirement for each individual system.

3.10.5.16. Upon completion of testing, turn all power sources off; disconnect
all cables, and remove temporary anodes. For ease of removal of ground rods
or small diameter pipes and conduit, use three flat metal bars as shown in
MIL HDBK 1136.

3.11. Electrolyte Resistivity Measurement.
3.11.1. The most common unit of resistivity is Ohm-centimeters.
3.11.2. Many factors in the operation of CP systems are dependent upon the
resistivity of the electrolyte:
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                  73

3.11.2.1. Resistance to earth of anodes is directly proportional to the resistivity
of the electrolyte.

3.11.2.2. The corrosivity of the environment is higher when the resistivity is
lower.

3.11.2.3. The output of both galvanic anodes and impressed current anodes is
dependent upon the resistivity of the electrolyte.

3.11.3. Four Pin Method: The most commonly used means of measuring soil
resistivity is by the four pin method.

3.11.3.1. In this method, a current is passed through two outer electrodes and a
drop in potential through the soil due to the passage of the current is measured
with a second pair of inner electrodes.

3.11.3.2. A specialized instrument is used to supply the current and measure
the potential drop (figure 3.5).

3.11.3.3. In order to reduce the influence of any stray currents in the area, the
instrument uses a unique 90 cycle square wave.

3.11.3.4. The electrodes should be arranged in a straight line, with equal
spacing between all electrodes (figure 3.6).

3.11.3.5. The electrodes should be inserted into the ground at an equal depth,
normally 4 inches.

3.11.3.6. The soil resistivity is calculated from the indicated reading by using
the following formula:

    Resistivity (Ohm-cm) = 191.5 x pin spacing (in feet) x meter reading.

3.11.3.7. In this method, the average resistivity of the soil between the two
center electrodes to a depth equal to the pin spacing is measured. Readings are
normally taken at approximately 2.5’, 5’ and 10’ (see chart below for using
common multipliers). For multipliers for common distances and distances for
even multipliers see table 3.2.

3.11.3.8. If the reading is greater as the pin spacing is increased, the actual soil
resistivity at the greater depth is greater than indicated.

3.11.3.9. If the average soil resistivity decreases at greater depths then the
actual soil resistivity at that depth is lower than indicated.

3.11.3.10. To calculate approximate resistivities at depth use the Barnes
Method formula (table 3.3). The Barnes method gives an approximation of
the average resistivity for a specific depth range. The change in the reciprocal
of the resistivity of two layers is used to estimate the lower level.

3.11.4. Two Pin Method. In the two pin method the potential drop is
measured between the same pair of electrodes used to supply the current. The
equipment used to make this type of measurement is often called the "Shepard
Canes" after its inventory. The probes are placed one foot apart. If the soil is
too hard for the probes to penetrate the reading is taken at the bottom of two
augured holes. The instrument is calibrated for a probe spacing of one foot and
gives a reading directly in Ohm-cm. This method is:

3.11.4.1. Less accurate than the four pin method.

3.11.4.2. Measures the resistivity of the soil only near the surface.

3.11.4.3. Often used for preliminary surveys.

3.11.4.4. Quicker than using the four pin method.

3.11.5. Other Methods (Soil Rod, Soil Box). A soil rod is essentially a two pin
resistivity measuring device where the electrodes are both mounted on a single
rod. Like the other two pin method, the resistivity of the soil to a very shallow
depth is measured. Also, the soil must be soft enough to allow penetration of
the rod. Measurements using the soil rod can, however, be made quickly when
making measurements in soft soil.

3.11.5.1. Soil samples can be taken and the resistivity of the sample can be
determined by the use of a soil box.

3.11.5.2. The measurement made on the soil sample is essentially the four pin
method.

3.11.5.3. Metal contacts in each end of the box are used to pass current through
the sample.
3.11.5.4. Potential drop is measured across probes inserted into the soil.
3.11.5.5. The resistivity is calculated using constants furnished with the
particular size of soil box being used.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                 78

3.11.5.6. Soil boxes are commonly designed with a multiplier of 1.

3.11.5.7. Soil box problems.

3.11.5.7.1. Due to the disturbance of the soil compaction will be different.

3.11.5.7.2. The sample may dry out during shipment.

3.11.5.7.3. To minimize drying out of samples they should be placed in plastic
bags and sealed prior to shipment.

3.11.5.7.4. Less likely to represent true in place soil resistivity than an actual
field test.

3.12. pH Testing Procedures. The pH of an electrolyte is a measure of the
acidity or alkalinity of the electrolytic solution.

3.12.1. pH ranges from 0 to 14: 0-7 being acidic; 7 being neutral., and 7-14
being alkaline.

3.12.2. pH can be measured using several methods.

3.12.2.1. Antimony electrode test method. Antimony is a unique metal
which has a direct relationship between the pH and its measured potential.
The potential difference or voltage developed between antimony and a
copper/copper sulfate reference electrode varies from approximately 0.1 volts
DC to 0.7 volts DC due to variations in the pH. Consequently it can be used
to determine the pH of the electrolyte when used in conjunction with this
reference electrode.

3.12.2.2. The antimony electrode must be cleaned prior to each use. Special
cleaning procedures must be used. Clean the antimony electrode as per
instructions in MIL HDBK 1136, Cleaning of the Electrode. Antimony is
very brittle, treat it carefully. The antimony tip must be kept smooth, there
must be no rough surface or pits.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               79

3.12.2.3. Place the antimony electrode and the copper/copper sulfate half cell
in contact with the electrolyte and measure the potential difference using a
high input resistance voltmeter.

3.12.2.4. The measurement takes several seconds to stabilize; this
stabilization is much slower in acid solutions than in alkaline solutions.

3.12.2.5. Avoid taking these measurements with CP current on. Current flow
in the electrolyte will affect the accuracy. If current flow cannot be stopped,
place the two electrodes close together, perpendicular to the direction of
current flow. To measure for the presence of any current flow in the
electrolyte. Place one copper/copper sulfate half cell in the electrolyte. Place
a second copper/copper sulfate half cell a few inches from the other reference
cell. Measure the potential difference using a high input resistance voltmeter.
Take measurements in several directions. If no current is present, the
measurements will read the same. If current is present, the lowest
measurement will be where the least amount of current is flowing.

3.12.3. Chemical test method:         Chemical test methods are normally
associated with liquid electrolyte samples.

3.12.3.1. Chemical methods of measuring pH involve either the use of pH
measuring electrodes or indicators whose colors are dependent on pH.

3.12.3.2. A pH meter measures the difference in potential between a pH
insensitive reference electrode and an electrode whose potential is sensitive to
pH.

3.12.3.3. Colored indicators are normally used in the form of pH papers.

3.12.3.4. The paper is wetted with the solution being measured and the
resulting color is compared with color standards to determine the pH.

3.12.3.5. When chemical meters or indicators are used to measure the pH of
soil the following procedure is used. A small amount of soil (one or two
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                              80

tablespoons) is placed in a clean container. If the sample has a moisture
content under 20%, a very small amount of distilled water is added. After
stirring, the mixture is allowed to settle. The pH of the liquid is measured.

3.13. Calibration of IR Drop Test Span. The IR drop test span is a type of
CP test station which is vital for determination of the direction and magnitude
of DC current flowing through a pipeline.

3.13.1. In protected pipelines, this information can be used to verify current
distribution and look for stray or interference current and the area of
influence of installed rectifiers.

3.13.2. In unprotected pipelines, this information can be used to find anodic
areas and discharge or pickup areas of stray or interference currents.

3.13.3. This method uses the metallic pipeline or cable as a shunt which is
then calibrated and used to measure a Millivolt "IR Drop", from which the
current can be calculated.

3.13.3.1. A known amount of DC current is applied to the pipeline. The
voltage drop across the length is measured.

3.13.3.2. The resistance can be calculated if the length and wall thickness of
the pipeline test span is accurately known. See table 3.4 to estimate the
resistance of the test span.

3.13.3.3. The line current can be calculated using ohms law, E = I * R, where
E is the measured voltage drop, R is the Resistance of the test span.

3.13.4. One other method for determining the direction and magnitude of DC
current flowing through a pipeline is to use a clamp-on milliammeter. This
method requires a very specialized piece of equipment, sized to the pipeline,
and an excavation or access to the pipeline, for placement of the probe around
the pipeline.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                  81

3.13.5. Do not use an ohmmeter to measure the resistance of the pipeline or
cable.

3.13.5.1. The current flowing on pipeline or cable will flow through the
meter and damage could result.

3.13.5.2. If that current does not damage the meter, the measurement would
not indicate a true resistance value. The voltage would be interpreted by the
meter as coming from the internal battery instead of the external electrical
circuit being measured.

3.13.6. The preferred method is to measure the actual resistance of the pipe
using test current. This method:

3.13.6.1. Does not require knowledge of the pipeline size.

3.13.6.2. Does not require knowledge of the pipeline wall thickness.

3.13.6.3. Is not affected by variations in the metal due to composition or
corrosion.

3.13.6.4. Is not affected by variations of resistance due to temperature.

3.13.6.5. Is not affected by inaccurate lengths of the test span.

3.13.6.6. The amount of test current required depends on the diameter of the
pipeline and the distance of the test span.

3.13.6.7. The larger the pipeline, the larger the amount of current required.

3.13.6.8. The shorter the distance of the test span, the larger the amount of
current required.

3.13.7. Calibration of an IR Drop test span consists of two measurement
circuits.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                              82

3.13.7.1. The outside circuit consists of:

3.13.7.1.1. An Ammeter to measure the current.

3.13.7.1.2. A DC power supply.

3.13.7.1.3. An on/off switch.

3.13.7.1.4. Some means of adjustment.

3.13.7.1.5. A portable rectifier may be used as the current source, switch and
the means of adjustment.

3.13.7.2. The inside circuit consists of a Millivolt Meter, connected across
the test span.

3.13.8. Pipelines and cables inherently will have current flowing at all times.
Therefore, a change in voltage drop measurement is compared to the amount
of test current applied.

3.13.9. Following all polarities, connect all circuit components. Polarity is
important for correct determination of the direction of the current flow in the
pipeline or cable during subsequent test procedures.

3.13.10. With Outside Circuit switch off, record the mV measurement of the
inside circuit. Starting at a low current level:

3.13.10.1. Turn the outside circuit switch on.

3.13.10.2. Adjust current up to the desired test current.

3.13.10.3. Record the measurement of the test current.

3.13.11. With Outside Circuit remaining on, record the mV measurement of
the inside circuit.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               83

3.13.12. Apply this data to the following formulas:

               Voltage On – Voltage Off*
Resistance =
                 Test Current applied

                Test Current applied
Factor =
                 Voltage Change*

3.13.13. Voltage Change must consider polarity.

3.13.13.1. For example, 4.1 mV on, minus 1.3 mV off, is a voltage change of
2.8 mV.

3.13.13.2. Whereas, 4.1 mV on, minus -1.3 mV off, is a voltage change of
5.4 mV.

3.13.13.3. (+ mV ON - -mV OFF = +mV ON + mV OFF = Voltage Change).

3.13.14. Record the resistance of the test span and the calibration factor
established. If the temperature of the pipeline or cable remains constant, this
calibration factor can be stenciled on the IR Drop Test Station and used for
future measurements. If doubt exists or temperatures change, perform the
calibration steps each time measurements are taken.
3.13.15. Direction of current flow is determined by the polarity of the mV
reading taken on the inside circuit, with meter positive on left, negative on
right. A positive IR Drop indicates current flow from left to right. A
negative IR Drop would indicate current flow from right to left.
3.13.16. The resistance of the pipeline can be calculated if the distance of the
test span is known and the size of the pipeline is accurately known.
Resistance joints or insulators cannot be present on the pipeline in the test
span. Variations in temperature will adversely affect the accuracy of these
calculations.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               84

3.13.17. The mV IR Drop is measured by using a Voltmeter on the mV scale.
Following all polarities, connect the meter to the inside circuit and record the
measurement. Polarity is important for correct determination of the direction
of the current flow in the pipeline or cable during subsequent test procedures.

3.13.18. The resistance is estimated using table 3.4.

AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                    85

3.13.18.1. The resistance is given in millionths of an ohm (.000001 ohms)
per linear foot of pipeline.

3.13.18.2. This resistance value must be multiplied by the number of feet in
the test span (distance in feet of the pipeline between the actual connection
points of the test station leads to the pipeline).

3.13.19. This data is then applied to the following formula:

            mV IR Drop
Current =
             Resistance

3.13.20. The direction of the current flow is determined from the polarity of
the mV IR Drop reading measured. For example, a positive IR Drop
indicates current flow from right to left, while a negative IR Drop would
indicate current flow from left to right.

3.13.21. The Multi-Combination meter has the capability of measuring
current by the "Null Ammeter Method". This meter can safely measure line
currents under 2 amps. Do not use this method in areas which has over 2
amps of line current. Stray current variations or other fluctuations in the
measurement may make keeping the meter nulled to obtain an accurate and
reliable measurement too difficult. This method does not require any
information on the length of the test span, diameter of the structure, or the
type of metal being tested.

3.14. Interference Testing Procedures. When current flows through an
electrolyte, it follows the path of least electrical resistance. If a metal structure
is immersed in the current carrying electrolyte, it is likely to present a low
resistance path for the flow of current. At the point where electrons enter the
structure from the electrolyte corrosion will be accelerated. Where electrons
leave the structure, corrosion will be reduced.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                             86

3.14.1. This phenomenon is called Cathodic Interference.     Cathodic
interference is commonly encountered on buried structures and can be
detected by electrical measurements and can be controlled.

3.14.2. CP sometimes causes undesirable effects on structures not connected
to the protection system. This occurs because some current is picked up by
these "foreign" structures at one point, and in attempting to return to the
source and complete the circuit, is discharged at another point.

3.14.3. Corrosion occurs at the current discharge point. Current can cause
corrosion damage by passing between two structures or across high-resistance
joints in the same structure.

3.14.4. Sources of Interference Currents may be constant or fluctuating.
Constant current sources have essentially constant direct current output, such
as CP rectifiers and thermoelectric generators.

3.14.5. Fluctuating current sources have a fluctuating direct current output
such as direct current electrified railway systems, coal mine haulage systems
and pumps, welding machines, direct current power systems, and telluric
currents.

3.14.6. See MIL HDBK 1136, section 2.2.4 for explanations and sources of
interference current.

3.14.7. Mitigation can usually be accomplished by installing an electrical
bond between the unprotected structure (at the location of maximum
discharge) and the protected structure.

3.14.8. Other mitigation methods include breaking the continuity of the
foreign pipeline, coating the foreign pipeline pickup area, coating the
protected pipeline in the discharge area of the foreign pipeline, and use of
galvanic anodes to apply current to the discharge area of the foreign pipeline
(and an alternate current discharge point).
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                 87

3.14.9. See section MIL HDBK 1136, section 5.6 for information on
Interference Corrosion Control.

3.14.10. Interference from CP rectifiers:

3.14.10.1. CPs systems are a major source of stray current on other metallic
structures.

3.14.10.2. Structures not electrically connected to the protected structures are
considered to be "foreign" structures.

3.14.10.3. A foreign structure may provide an alternate path for the current
flowing from the impressed current anodes to a protected structure.

3.14.10.4. If this path is of sufficiently low resistance, significant current
flow will occur.

3.14.10.5. Since there is no metallic return path, the current will discharge
from the surface of the foreign structure to the electrolyte in order to return to
its source, resulting in severe corrosion.

3.14.10.6. Testing requires cooperation by the owners of the structures
involved.

3.14.10.6.1. Such cooperation is best effected by a corrosion coordinating
committee; all companies operating underground or underwater structures,
and particularly those under CP, should be members of such a committee.

3.14.10.6.2. A list of most existing committees may be obtained from the
National Association of Corrosion Engineers, P.O. Box 218340 Houston, TX,
77218-8340.

3.14.10.7. Interference testing is usually performed when new CP systems are
first installed but is sometimes detected through routine field measurements.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                             88

3.14.10.8. Good record keeping is very useful in preventing cathodic
interference problems as any system changes, particularly additions of new
buried structures, can be more easily determined when proper records are kept.

3.14.10.9. Interference tests must be made on all structures adjacent to a CP
system to determine effects and to allow design of mitigation measures.
Cathodic interference can be detected by measuring structure-to-soil
potentials, potential gradients and current flow (IR drop) with CP current or
resistance bonds on and/or cycled on and off. Structure-to-soil potentials
give indications of interference only when measured in an area of current
discharge or pick-up on the foreign structure.

3.14.10.10. Abnormal or unusual current distribution on a protected structure
indicates possible interference on a foreign structure.

3.14.10.11. Current flow (IR drop) readings show the relationship between
pick-up and discharge areas on a foreign structure.

3.14.10.12. A CP rectifier output contains a waveform, which results in a
pulsating DC signal.

3.14.10.13. Presence of this pulsating DC on foreign structures indicates
interference from a rectifier.

3.14.10.14. When conducting current requirement tests or initially energizing
impressed current CP systems, all companies owning underground structures
in the area should be notified and coordination tests made with those
interested.

3.14.10.15. Current drainage requirements for each structure, from tests at
various anode locations, can be determined.

3.14.11. The best method to locate interference is to perform a pipe-to-soil
potential survey of the foreign pipeline with the source of the interference
cycled on and off at specific intervals.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                                  89

3.14.11.1. The algebraic difference between the "on" and "off" reading
(potential shift) gives the interference effect on the foreign structure.

3.14.11.2. The location showing greatest pipe-to-soil potential change in the
positive ("unprotected") direction is called the "critical" or "control" point.

3.14.11.3. This is often at the point where protected and unprotected
pipelines cross. The areas showing pipe-to-soil potential change in the
negative ("protected") direction are called "pickup" areas.

3.14.11.4. Presence of a pickup area on a foreign structure indicates that
interference is present, and a discharge area exists somewhere on that
structure.

3.14.11.5. If metallic continuity exists between the foreign structure and the
negative terminal of the rectifier, this is not interference, it is protection, and
no discharge area exists (and therefore, by definition is not a foreign
structure).

3.14.12. If the source of the cathodic interference is not known, it can be
detected by measuring structure-to-soil potentials with CP current on and
potential gradients.
3.14.13. Structure-to-soil potentials give indications of interference only
when measured in an area of current discharge or pick-up on the foreign
structure. Potential gradients are measured by the cell-to-cell test procedures
in paragraph 3.5.
3.14.14. Taking these measurements along the foreign pipeline may locate
the discharge point and pickup areas.
3.14.14.1. The polarity must be ascertained to determine the direction of
current flow and magnitude. Current will flow in the direction of the
discharge point. The magnitude will increase as you near the discharge point.
3.14.14.2. The direction will reverse upon passing a discharge point. The
reversal with the highest magnitude is the "control" or "critical" point. The
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                              90

discharge point is normally near the structure, which is causing the
interference.

3.14.14.3. The pickup area is normally near the anode system, which is
causing the interference. Locating the pickup area is important in locating the
source of the interference, since it shows the direction that the current is
coming from.

3.14.15. Measurement of the current flow (IR drop) on a foreign pipeline can
be accomplished if other methods are inconclusive.

3.14.15.1. Current flow (IR drop) readings show the relationship between
pick-up and discharge areas on a foreign structure.

3.14.15.2. By measuring the current flow on a foreign structure, the direction
of the discharge point and pickup areas can be determined.

3.14.15.3. Magnitude indicates seriousness, and increases as the distance to
the discharge point decreases.

3.14.15.4. These measurements can be easily accomplished if IR drop test
stations already exist or if the pipeline is accessible (comes aboveground or
passes through pits).

3.14.15.5. Current is measured at an IR drop test station by the procedures
detailed in paragraph 3.13.
3.14.15.6. Current is measured where access to the pipeline is possible using
a clamp-on milliammeter (such as the Swain CP AmpClip). The correct size
clamp must be used for the pipeline under test. Note: Typical clamp-on
meters do not work in this application, it must be capable of measuring DC
amps, with a range capable of accurate measurement of under 30 milliamps.
3.14.16. Abnormal or unusual current distribution on a protected structure
indicates possible interference on a foreign structure. Normally the potential
of a protected structure decreases slightly as distance from the anodes
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                              91

increases. At defects in coatings the potential of a protected structure
decreases. An increase in potential normally indicates current pickup. If the
potential of a protected pipeline increases when crossing a foreign pipeline,
interference is likely on that structure. Potential survey of that structure,
while interrupting the source of current will indicate the presence and
magnitude of that interference.

3.14.17. A CP rectifier output contains a waveform, which results in a
pulsating DC signal.

3.14.17.1. This signal can be located using a pipe locator capable of
following a 120 cycles per second (cps) signal (such as the Pipe Horn, Model
200 FDAC, in rectifier mode).

3.14.17.2. Presence of this signal indicates presence of interference on the
foreign structure.

3.14.17.3. Combining this method with a current interrupter on suspected
sources of the interference will expeditiously locate the source of the
interference.

3.14.17.4. Signal strength can sometimes be used to indicate the direction of
the discharge and pickup areas.

3.14.17.5. Normally signal strength will increase in the direction of the
discharge point. This may not occur with multiple discharge areas.

3.14.18. Another method of interference testing is to use an experimental
drainage bond between structures.

3.14.18.1. Proper drainage can be determined by trial-and-error, using a
variable resistor to alter drainage current.

3.14.18.2. Required drainage current can also be computed from test data.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                               92

3.14.18.3. When the same owner maintains the protected structure and the
foreign structure, this method may be easily used.

3.14.18.4. The source of interference is cycled on and off at specific intervals
and the bond resistance is adjusted until no potential shift occurs on the
foreign structure.

3.14.18.5. When site conditions warrant, the bond may be sized to apply
partial or full protection to the foreign structure.

3.14.18.6. If the foreign structure is small or well coated, and the protected
structure is poorly coated, this option may be taken when sufficient CP
current is still available to maintain protection on the protected structure.

3.14.19. Interference from variable (fluctuating) sources. While interference
testing determines effects of steady stray currents, another type of stray
current survey analyzes fluctuating stray currents. Fluctuating or periodic
changes in structure-to-electrolyte voltage values and unusual or fluctuating
currents are indicative of stray currents.
3.14.19.1. Stray currents may affect structures just as CP does. Structures
may be protected or damaged by stray DC currents, depending on whether
current is flowing to or from the structure.
3.14.19.2. Such analysis is specialized and requires study to master all
techniques.
3.14.19.3. The basic principles are the same as in the previous section (see
above). The difference is that the stray DC current is not present at the same
location all the time. DC current pick-up and discharge areas are constantly
changing.
3.14.19.4. The use of data loggers or recording devices at many points on the
foreign structure, simultaneously, will indicate the same information as
above.

3.14.19.5. Locating the discharge point(s) and pickup areas are still crucial.
AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1 1 February 1999                              93

3.14.19.6. In this case, determining the time of the interference is also
crucial.

3.14.20. All the basic measurements can be used in studying fluctuating stray
currents. Perhaps the most informative are measurements similar to those
used in interference testing; structure-to-electrolyte potentials and IR drops
along structure or electrolyte. Methods of analysis, however, are different
and specialized equipment is used. The major concern in performing a stray
current survey is to find out the degree of damage and determine the source
of the stray DC current.

3.14.21. Measurement of the foreign pipeline potentials is commonly used to
determine the pickup and discharge areas.

3.14.21.1. Using data loggers or recording devices, many locations on the
foreign structure are monitored simultaneously.

3.14.21.2. This data is then charted to analyze for the presence of
interference.

3.14.21.3. When the exact moment of interference is determined, all
potential readings taken at that instant are used to determine the discharge
and pickup points.

3.14.21.4. Data taken is used to locate areas for taking additional data.

3.14.21.5. Once gathered, this data is used exactly like the data for cathodic
interference detailed previously.

3.14.21.6. Abnormal potentials on other structures may also be used for
further analysis.

3.14.21.7. Once the pickup area and time is determined, the source of the
current may be located (see MIL HDBK 1136, section 2.2.4 for sources of
fluctuating stray currents).

3.14.22. Another method of finding these points is through current
measurements.

3.14.22.1. In order to determine the pick-up and discharge points in
fluctuating stray current areas, data from several test points are plotted over a
period of time.

3.14.22.2. Current values on the several locations on the foreign structure
(recorded from IR drop test spans or a clamp-on milliammeter) are plotted
over a period of time.

3.14.22.3. The current must be measured at several points simultaneously,
sufficient readings being made to cover the range of variation of the current
(usually at least 24 hours) using recording voltmeters and or data loggers.

3.14.22.4. By analyzing the current direction and magnitude at the time the
interference is occurring, the relationship and direction of the pickup areas
and discharge areas can be determined.

3.14.22.5. Once the time of interference is known, the area of pickup can be
searched for possible sources of the current pickup (see MIL HDBK 1136,
section 2.2.4 for sources of fluctuating stray currents).
3.14.22.6. Outside of the necessity of taking simultaneous readings due to
the fluctuating current, this method is the same as conventional line current
measurement.
