1. General.
1. (AETC)General. For the 306th Flying Training Groups (FTG), operations group
commander (OG/CC) and wing commander (WG/CC) refer to the FTG/CC. For the 479 FTG,
OG/CC refers to the FTG/CC. For the 336th Training Group (TRG), OG/CC and WG/CC refer
to the TRG/CC.
     1.1. The basic supervision structure for flying operations consists of the Operations Group
     Commander (OG/CC), the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) and the squadron supervisors, i.e.,
     Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup, also referred to as Top 3).
     1.1. (12FTW) 306 FTG Only. The Operations Supervision structure also includes the 94th
     Flying Training Squadron (FTS) Soaring Control Officer (SCO), and the 98 FTS Drop Zone
     Control Officer (DZCO). Guidance for these unique programs can be found in the individual
     squadron’s respective operating instructions.
     1.2. The chain of supervision begins with the OG/CC, through the SOF, down to the
     individual squadron supervisors. The requirements for each position are specified in para 3.
     Specific duties and responsibilities are defined throughout this instruction.
     1.3. For the purpose of this instruction “experienced” is used in accordance with (IAW) the
     definition provided in the Mission Design Series (MDS) specific AFI 11-2MDS Volume 1.
        1.3.1. For the purposes of this instruction only, aircrews are also considered
        “experienced” when previously rated “experienced” in another MDS or previously rated
        “experienced” in a different crew position in the same MDS. These individuals must then
        be selected by the Squadron CC and approved by the OG/CC for operations supervision
        responsibilities.
        1.3.2. Where no definition is provided, “experienced” will be determined by the unit
        squadron commander and approved by OG/CC.
2. Functions:
     2.1. SOF. When on duty, the SOF is a group-level position and is the direct representative of
     the OG/CC. The SOF is the focal point for command and control of flight operations. OG/CC
     decision authority is delegated to this position to accomplish the mission.
     2.1. (AETC) The 58 OG/CC, 97 OG/CC, 314 OG/CC, 479 FTG, and 336 TRG/CC will
     determine if a wing supervisor of flying (SOF) is required. In these units, if a SOF is not
     used, either the operations supervisor (Ops Sup) or a duty officer will be on duty in the
     squadron to handle squadron-unique issues. Individuals functioning in this capacity must be
     current and qualified in a unit aircraft.
     2.1. (12FTW) SOF. 479 FTG Only. Due to the nature of flying operations at NAS
     Pensacola the 479 FTG/CC has determined that a SOF is not required. The respective
     squadron Ops Sup will be on duty in each squadron to handle squadron-unique issues as
     directed in this supplement. Additionally, the squadron Ops Sup will perform the SOF
     functions unless specifically noted in this supplement.
AFI11-418_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 25 JULY 2013                                                        7


      2.1.1. SOF is not required for rescue/weather/electronic attack/airlift/air refueling/special
      operations/deployed U-2 Ops. (For C2ISR, the OG/CC will determine if a SOF program
      is required. If a program is established this Instruction applies. At a minimum, C2ISR
      units will establish an Ops Sup/Top 3 program.)
   2.2. Ops Sup/Top 3. The squadron Ops Sup/Top 3 will only be filled by the following
   individuals: the squadron commander, the squadron operations officer, assistant operations
   officer(s), flight commanders, or other individuals deemed qualified by the squadron
   commander and approved by the OG/CC. ANG/AFRC: OG/CC or Air Operations Officer
   (AOO) will determine requirements for Ops Sup and will determine the appropriate
   personnel to fill the Ops Sup position. ANG/AFRC may combine SOF and Ops Sup duties.
   2.2. (12FTW) Ops Sup/Top 3. Squadron Operations Supervisors will be nominated by the
   squadron commander and approved for training by the OG/CC. Use Attachment 7 as a
   guide for nominating individuals to perform squadron Ops Sup duties. Use Attachment 8
   (12 OG/479 FTG) and Attachment 10 (306 FTG) to document training. These upgrade
   checklists outline the minimum training requirements for Squadron Ops Sup programs.
   Upon completion of training the SQ/CC will certify that all training has been completed and
   recommend certification. The OG/CC will certify all squadron Ops Sups. Squadrons are
   responsible for annotating certification on the AF Form 4348 and squadron LOX, and
   ensuring nomination letter and training checklist/certification documentation is maintained in
   the individuals training folder.
      2.2.1. Squadron commander and operations officer decision authority may be delegated
      to this position to make operations-related decisions and recommendations.
      2.2.1. (12FTW) Squadron commanders will be responsible for administering the Ops
      Sup program to include establishing procedures for documenting and correcting its
      program and equipment deficiencies.
      2.2.2. (Added-AETC) The Ops Sup is the focal point for decisions affecting squadron
      flying operations and will ensure flying operations comply with applicable directives.
      The OG/CC will establish a training program for those selected for Ops Sup duties. On a
      case-by-case basis and with the OG/CC’s approval, an individual who has not been
      trained or certified as an Ops Sup may perform Ops Sup duties. This will allow short-
      term coverage until a trained and certified Ops Sup can assume these duties.
      2.2.3. (Added-AETC) The Ops Sup will be at the primary duty location to the
      maximum extent possible and, as a minimum, available as outlined in Table 1, while on
      duty.
(EXCEPTION: The 98 FTS Ops Sup may provide supervision from outside the primary duty
location for UV-18 sorties that do not conduct operations at the USAF Academy.)

      2.2.3. (12FTW) The primary duty location for the Ops Sup will be the respective
      squadron operations desk. Note: 479 FTG Only. The alternate location will be the other
      squadron operations desk. The “Alternate Ops Sup Location Plan” is contained in the
      QRC.
   2.3. (Added-12FTW) 306 FTG Only. Drop Zone Control Officer (DZCO). The DZCO
   is the direct representative of the 98 FTS Ops Sup and is the focal point for command and

     control of jump operations. The DZCO works closely with the Ops Sup to ensure the safe
     and effective accomplishment of the jump mission. Decision authority for all jump-related
     issues is delegated to this position.
     2.4. (Added-12FTW) 306 FTG Only. Soaring Control Officer (SCO). The SCO is the
     direct representative of the 94 FTS Ops Sup and is the focal point for soaring operations.
     The SCO is responsible for command and control of soaring operations (call sign
     “Overlord”). In addition, the duty position of SCO Training Officer (SCOTO) exists to
     manage the squadron’s Ops Sup/SCO programs and act as the squadron’s point of contact for
     the 306 FTG SOF program.
3. Operations. This section identifies the minimum flying unit supervisory requirements
depending on types of operations involved. (Additional requirements can be defined in the unit
supplement).
     3.1. Types of Operations. The definitions for types of operations that are used in Table 1
     are:
        3.1.1. Daily Flying Operations. Normal or surge operations at the unit's home station
        (this does not include other types of operations defined below).
            3.1.1.1. (Added-12FTW) 12 OG Only. Missions that takeoff and land at home
            station, to include FCF and out-and-back sorties, are considered “daily flying
            operations” for the purposes of this instruction and a SOF will be required. For
            reduced flying operations such as flyovers, composite flights, etc, the OG/CC will
            determine SOF requirements. In these situations, only one SOF (normally Randy
            SOF) is required if local flying is complete or suspended.
            3.1.1.2. (Added-12FTW) 306 FTG Only. 94 FTS, 98 FTS, and 557 FTS local
            cross country sorties, “round robins” that depart and land at home station, and FCF
            sorties are considered “daily flying operations” for the purposes of this instruction,
            and a SOF is required when operating into or out of KAFF. 94 FTS and 557 FTS
            aircraft home station is KAFF. 98 FTS aircraft home station is KCOS and only
            requires an Ops Sup when conducting non-parachuting operations.
            3.1.1.3. (Added-12FTW) 479 FTG Only. T-6 and T-1 missions that take off and
            land at NAS Pensacola, to include FCF and out-and-back sorties, are considered
            “daily flying operations” for the purposes of this instruction.
        3.1.2. On-Going Off Station Sorties. Missions/sorties that do not takeoff or land at
        home station.
        3.1.2. (AETC) Cross-country sorties are considered on-going off station sorties.
        3.1.2. (12FTW) On-Going Off Station Sorties. 306 FTG Only. For the 306 FTG
        these “on-going off-station sorties” include any flying contingent designated as a training
        TDY or competition. An Ops Sup is required on the contingent and will report the
        beginning and end of all daily flying operations and any unusual occurrences to the
        respective SQ/DO, or SQ/CC. In all cases, the Ops Sup will notify the FTG-A of ANY
        unusual occurrences (e.g. bird strikes, reserve canopy deployment, hot brakes).
        3.1.3. Deployed Operations. Flight operations away from home station that are part of
        a deployment, exercise or contingency.
AFI11-418_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 25 JULY 2013                                                    9


     3.1.3. (AETC) Deployed operations are defined as five or more aircraft away from
     home station with the intent to accomplish multiple sorties from the same location.
     3.1.4. Scrambles. Aircraft launched on a scramble order from an alert posture.
  3.2. Minimum Supervision Requirements. These are outlined in Table 1 for each type of
  operation.
     3.2.1. (Added-12FTW) Deployed operations will utilize a SOF, Ops Sup, or
     detachment commander at the discretion of the OG/CC or FTG/CC. Consideration will
     be given to the type of sortie (ID vs. student training) and complexity of the training
     involved. (See Table 1. Note 2).Note: 12 OG Only. A SOF will not be required in the
     primary duty location for T-1 recoveries when 4 or less T-1s are airborne, the sorties are
     2 hours or less, and all other local flying is complete, unless directed by the OG/CC.
     Supervision will be delegated to squadron Ops Sups IAW AFI 11-418 Table
     1. Relinquishing SOFs will coordinate with T-1 squadron Ops Sups prior to handoff of
     SOF responsibilities.
     3.2.2. (Added-12FTW) Cross-Country Sortie Supervision Requirements. A SOF is
     required in the primary duty location for all cross-country departures, but not for cross-
     country returns. Note: 479 FTG Only. Ops Sups will be on duty for Cross Country
     Departures until 30 minutes after the aircraft’s actual takeoff time. Ops Sups will be on
     duty for cross-country returns at least one hour prior to the aircraft’s planned time of
     arrival.

For reduced flying operations the OG/CC may determine if a SOF is required. Reduced flying
operations are defined as 4 or less fighter aircraft or 2 or less of the same type of non-fighter
aircraft or, while adhering to these limitations for fighter and non-fighter aircraft, 6 total aircraft
if 2 or more are RPA.

1. (AETC) For airlift or tanker operations, the Ops Sup will remain at the primary duty location
until the crew for the last launch of the day leaves the squadron for their mission. As long as
there are no outstanding issues, the Ops Sup may then notify the wing SOF and depart the duty
location, but must remain on telephone recall. Profile changes made after the step brief, but
before takeoff, will be coordinated with the Ops Sup by telephone. The SOF will remain on duty
as long as aircraft are airborne and will ensure any Ops Sup released is recalled as necessary.
Ops Sups released to telephone recall may begin crew rest for the next day’s flying activities
(flying, SOF duty, etc.). However, any official interruptions, including telephone calls, will
trigger crew rest interruption safeguards for the next day’s flying activities (AFI 11-202, Volume

   5.1. The primary objective during an abnormal/emergency situation is the safe recovery of
   the aircrew and aircraft. When establishing procedures, units will consider:
      5.1.1. Providing a single, discrete frequency for recovering an emergency aircraft. ATC
      and the emergency aircrew should determine when to use a single frequency approach
      (SFA). The SOF will have access to the SFA. The SFA should be available to
      crash/fire/rescue personnel to monitor the recovery.
      5.1.1. (AETC) In-flight emergency (IFE) aircrews recovering to an RSU-controlled
      runway will switch to the RSU frequency according to local procedures.
      5.1.1. (12FTW) None of the three Groups in the 12FTW have Single Frequency
      Approach (SFA) capability. SOFs and squadron Ops Sups may use their shared
      frequency to discuss actions with the pilot of distressed aircraft. With the approval of the
      Tower Watch Supervisor, SOFs may transmit on tower frequencies. This option should
      be exercised judiciously.
      5.1.2. Using the command post, or other capable agency, to notify all appropriate
      agencies and key personnel of an IFE and provide situation updates.
      5.1.2. (AETC) At the first opportunity, units will notify the OG/CC of the situation and
      the radio frequency to be used in the aircraft recovery.
      5.1.2. (12FTW) During an IFE, the SOF will ensure the Command Post is notified,
      when able, to facilitate communications. SOFs are expected to use all assets available to
      recover IFEs. After any IFE or unusual occurrence the SOF will ensure applicable
      information is contained in the daily SOF Log to include any lessons learned.
          5.1.2.1. (Added-12FTW) 479 FTG Only. Ops Sups will first notify the group
          commander (or designated representative) of any IFE or other unusual occurrence as
          soon as possible but without hindering assistance to the aircrew. The SQ/CC will also
          be notified as soon as conditions permit.
      5.1.3. Prioritizing actions during concurrent emergencies/abnormal situations.
      5.1.4. Authorizing direct communications (over discrete SOF or squadron common
      frequency) from the Ops Sup/Top 3 to an IFE aircrew. NOTE: Only ATC personnel may
 24                                    AFI11-418_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 25 JULY 2013


      authorize direct communication over ATC frequencies, including the SFA frequency.
      However, this does not preclude the SOF and/or Ops Sup/Top 3 from using whatever
      communication necessary, to include GUARD and SFA, to prevent an unsafe situation
      that could immediately jeopardize safe recovery.
      5.1.5. That only the ground on-scene commander, normally the fire chief, can terminate
      an emergency.
      5.1.6. That the final decision during any IFE/abnormal situation rests with the aircraft
      commander. However, SOFs may declare an IFE for any aircraft based on their
      knowledge of the aircraft and the flight and airfield environment.
      5.1.7. Obtaining a chase ship for single ship emergency aircraft if time permits.
      5.1.8. If the SOF is not qualified in or technically knowledgeable of the aircraft with an
      IFE, then directing the Ops Sup/Top 3 or other highly experienced individual to report to
      the SOF's duty location during an abnormal situation/recovery if time permits.
      5.1.8. (12FTW) 479 FTG Only. Ops Sups should consider directing another qualified
      individual to the duty desk to assist in the safe recovery of the aircrew and aircraft.
6. SOF Guidance. Unless noted otherwise, this guidance applies to the Ops Sup/Top 3 when a
SOF is either unavailable or not used.
   6.1. SOF/ATC Relationship:
      6.1.1. The separation and sequencing of traffic are the responsibilities of ATC. Unless
      safety is an issue, the SOF will work directly with the watch supervisor. To promote
      effective and efficient flight operations, the SOF may suggest, based on knowledge of the
      flying schedule and unique circumstances of individual missions, actions that affect ATC
      concerns or desires.
      6.1.2. Except in an emergency, the SOF will not transmit over ATC frequencies without
      prior coordination with ATC (this does not apply to dedicated SOF frequencies). All
      radio transmissions to a distressed aircrew, from other than the SOF or ATC, will be
      coordinated through the SOF (this does not apply to the Ops Sup/Top3 if communicating
      to the aircrew via a squadron common frequency).
      6.1.2. (12FTW) SOFs will only use Guard (243.0/121.5) when necessary for safety of
      flight. In general, if the flying status has changed the alternate/fuel requirements, then
      SOFs will coordinate with the watch supervisor to use Guard to notify aircrew. N/A for
      479 FTG.
   6.2. Duty Hours:
      6.2.1. Prior to beginning supervisory duties, the SOF will meet crew rest requirements as
      directed by AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules, as supplemented.
      6.2.2. Maximum duty day for SOF is 16 hours with a limit of 12 hours performing SOF
      duties. The OG/CC is waiver authority and may extend a SOF duty day up to 16 hours
      on a case-by-case basis. (AFGSC Missile Wings: For alert and scramble operations, the
      SOF maximum duty day is 24 hrs as long as alert/sleeping facilities are readily available).
AFI11-418_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 25 JULY 2013                                                 25


     6.2.2. (AETC) Maximum duty day for SOF is 12 hours. The OG/CC is waiver authority
     and may extend the duty day up to 16 hours on a case-by-case basis.
     6.2.3. The SOF will be at the prescribed duty location IAW Table 1 NLT 30 minutes
     prior to first takeoff in order to complete required duties in paragraph 4.3
  6.3. Duty Location:
     6.3.1. Primary Duty Location. The primary duty location for active duty units will be
     in the control tower. (AFGSC Missile Wings: the primary duty location will be
     designated by the OG/CC).
     6.3.1. (AETC) If the SOF is not in the primary duty location, he or she must be
     available to the OG/CC via a handheld radio or cellular phone.
        6.3.1.1. (Added-12FTW) 12 OG Only. The designated alternate location for SOFs
        is the other control tower or squadron duty desk, as appropriate. When SOF functions
        cannot be performed from one control tower, the displaced SOF will move to their
        squadron duty desk with all aircraft information (scheduled, airborne, landed, etc.).
        The relocated SOF will remain at their squadron duty desk until the situation is
        resolved or until their respective aircraft have terminated flying for the day. Randy
        SOFs will ensure positive communication with the remaining Ops Sups on the East
        runway.
        6.3.1.2. (Added-12FTW) 12 OG Only. A T-1/T-38 SOF (call sign ‘Randy SOF’)
        will occupy the East Tower. A T-6 SOF (call sign ‘Hangover SOF’) will occupy the
        West Tower. When weather conditions warrant (i.e., the status is Standby or Stop
        Launch) the SOF may vacate the tower as long as they carry the hand-held radio and
        maintain contact with the OG/CC.
     6.3.2. Alternate Duty Location. The OG/CC will designate alternate duty locations in
     the unit supplement to this instruction. As a minimum, the location must have adequate
     communication equipment and the capability to monitor weather conditions. It is
     desirable to have a SOF duty position from which ground operations, takeoffs, landings
     and local traffic patterns can be observed. The following is a list of recommended
     alternate locations:
        6.3.2.1. The SOF vehicle on the airfield.
        6.3.2.2. The runway monitoring unit (RMU)/runway supervisory unit (RSU).
        6.3.2.3. The unit dispatch desk.
        6.3.2.4. The command post.
     6.3.3. At both the primary and alternate duty locations the SOF will have timely access
     to a SOF vehicle and the airfield environment when required. AFRC: units are not
     required to have a dedicated vehicle for the SOF, but must be provided access to a
     vehicle to perform required duties in a timely manner.
  6.4. Equipment:
     6.4.1. The following communication equipment must be functional and immediately
     available to the SOF:
26                                    AFI11-418_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 25 JULY 2013


        6.4.1.1. A dedicated multi-frequency radio (UHF, VHF and/or HF, as appropriate
        based on supported aircraft capabilities).
        6.4.1.1. (AETC) For the primary SOF positions located in the tower, the radio must
        have the capability to be recorded. The SOF will have the capability to monitor
        ground, tower, and emergency frequencies.
        6.4.1.1. (12FTW) 479 FTG Only. NAS Pensacola Ground Electronics does not
        permit units access to a multi-frequency radio. Squadrons will utilize Ops
        frequencies and a UHF/VHF scanner to monitor aircraft.
        6.4.1.2. A telephone (land-line or cellular telephone) or FM radio to contact the
        OG/CC (or designated representative), command post, Ops Sups, weather facility and
        ATC watch supervisors. Dedicated phone lines (hot-lines) are preferred.
        6.4.1.2. (AETC) All primary SOF locations will have dedicated telephone hot-lines
        to the OG/CC, home field RSUs (if applicable), auxiliary field RSUs as specified in
        AETCI 11-204 (if applicable), base operations, and applicable air traffic control
        facilities (as determined by the OG/CC).
     6.4.2. Access to approved weather resources will be available (net-centric data
     dissemination system, etc).
     6.4.2. (AETC) The weather dissemination system must have the capability to access
     weather radar information and local weather products.
     6.4.3. Units are required to have a dedicated SOF vehicle immediately available to the
     SOF and positioned to respond to emergencies, perform airfield inspections, or other
     official functions. This vehicle must have a flight line clearance and be equipped with a
     multi-channel radio capable of contacting unit aircraft and ATC. Waiver authority for this
     requirement is the Wing Commander or equivalent.
     6.4.3. (AETC) The WG/CC may delegate SOF vehicle waiver authority to the OG/CC.
     6.4.3. (12FTW) The 12 FTW/CC delegates SOF vehicle waiver authority to each Group
     Commander. Contact 12 OG/OGV or 306 FTG/FTGV for the current status of their
     Group’s SOF vehicle requirement and waiver letter if applicable. The 479 FTG does not
     utilize a SOF nor a SOF vehicle, so if transportation on the airfield is needed, contact
     Wing Safety for assistance.
     6.4.4. Locally developed checklists will be available to outline procedures for normal
     and emergency situations that included, as a minimum, the items listed in Attachment 2.
     6.4.5. Dedicated binoculars will be immediately available for SOF use when either in the
     primary or alternate duty location for a clear view of the runway.
     6.4.6. A SOF library will be available (either hard copy or electronic as outlined in the
     unit supplement to this instruction) that includes applicable directives and instructions (to
     include AF, HHQ, and local guidance), aircraft TOs, checklists, in-flight guides, and SOF
     read/information file.
     6.4.6. (AETC) The SOF will have access to publications (AFI 11-2MDS-specific
     Volumes 3 and AFI 11-202, Volume 3) and aircraft technical orders (TO) for each type
AFI11-418_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 25 JULY 2013                                                     27


     of aircraft flown in the wing or group. Additional requirements will be at the discretion of
     the OG/CC.
         6.4.6.1. (Added-12FTW) 12 OG Only. The 12 OG SOF Program Manager (PM)
         will ensure that a current Dash-1 for the T-1, T-6, and T-38 are available in both
         towers. Dash-1 checklists and in-flight guides for the T-1 & T-38 will be made
         available in the East Tower while a Dash-1 checklist and in-flight guide for the T-6
         will be made available in the West Tower. All other SOF publications will be made
         available on-line.
         6.4.6.2. (Added-12FTW) 306 FTG Only. Publications are available on the 306

     equipment outlined in this section will be available at this new location (pre-positioned or
     transported).
     6.4.7. (12FTW) 306 FTG Only. If repositioning to the alternate SOF location, SOFs
     will hand-carry the SOF Binder, the FM (“Brick”) and VHF radios.
     6.4.8. (Added-AETC) A SOF information read file will be maintained.
     6.4.8. (12FTW) 479 FTG Only. Individual squadrons will maintain an Ops Sup read
     file at the squadron operations desk.
  6.5. Certification:
     6.5.1. SOF nominees will be experienced (IAW paragraph 1.3.), rated officers with
     proven maturity, judgment and supervisory ability and must be combat mission ready
     (CMR) or basic mission capable (BMC) in a unit aircraft
         6.5.1.1. Non-CMR (N-CMR)/non-BMC (N-BMC) aircrew members may perform
         SOF duties at the discretion of the OG/CC on the condition that the status must be
         temporary in nature and all SOF currencies must be maintained IAW paragraph 6.7.
     6.5.2. To gain initial certification, all SOFs will complete the SOF upgrade program
     IAW paragraph 6.6.
     6.5.3. SOFs that are currently under a Duties Not Involving Flying (DNIF) status may
     perform SOF duties when specifically cleared by a flight surgeon on an AF Form 1042.
     6.5.4. Loss of SOF certification will occur for any of the following reasons:
         6.5.4.1. PCS or 179/365 day TDYs (unless the individual is performing SOF duties
         and able to retain currency while TDY).
         6.5.4.2. Direct action by the OG/CC through a written statement in the individuals
         training folder and removal from the unit “Letter of Xs” or equivalent document. Any
         supervisor may recommend action to the OG/CC for the removal of an individual’s
         SOF certification.
         6.5.4.2. (AETC) The OG/CC will sign the individual’s AF Form 4348 indicating
         decertification.
28                                   AFI11-418_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 25 JULY 2013


     6.5.5. The source documents for certifying SOF certifications are the OG/CC-signed
     approval document in the individual’s training folder and the unit “Letter of Xs” or
     equivalent document.
     6.5.5. (AETC) An AF Form 4348 signed by the OG/CC will be filed in the individual’s
     training folder and used as the SOF certification source document.
     6.5.6. Units will define who is certified to upgrade other aircrew members to SOF in the
     unit supplement to this instruction.
  6.6. Certification Program:
     6.6.1. Documentation of the unit upgrade program will be described in the unit
     supplement to this instruction, but will, at a minimum, include a signed document by the
     OG/CC kept in the individuals training folder that approves him/her for SOF duties.
     Additionally, upon completion of the upgrade flow, the unit “Letter of Xs” or equivalent
     document will be updated to reflect the SOF certification.
     6.6.1. (AETC) An AF Form 4348 signed by the OG/CC will be filed in the individual’s
     training folder and used as the SOF certification source document.
     6.6.1. (12FTW) The maximum length for SOF training is 60 calendar days (120 days
     for AFRC in the 306 FTG) starting the day of the SOF Program Manager initial upgrade
     briefing, and ending the day the Program Manager signs the completed checklist (prior to
     the OG/CC interview). If unusual circumstances such as leave, TDY or DNIF, prevent a
     SOF candidate from finishing training on time, the individual will notify the squadron
     SOFLO and the SOF Program Manager. Document the reason for the delay on a
     memorandum for record (MFR) signed by the SQ/CC. The SOF Program Manager will
     review the training record and MFR to determine if additional training is necessary.
     6.6.2. Squadron commanders will screen and review (IAW para. 6.5.) all SOF candidates
     before nominating them for entry into the upgrade program.
     6.6.2. (AETC) Squadron commanders will nominate the minimum number of SOF
     candidates necessary to safely accomplish the mission. A Letter of Xs will reflect this
     certification.
     6.6.2. (12FTW) Squadron Commanders will nominate SOF candidates (assigned,
     attached, and AFRC) using Attachment 11. Once the SOF nomination letter has been
     signed by the OG/CC or FTG/CC, the SOF trainee will contact the SOF Program
     Manager to receive their initial upgrade briefing. Use Attachment 12 (12 OG/479 FTG)
     or Attachment 13 (306 FTG) to document training requirements.
     6.6.3. All SOF candidates will receive an interview and briefing from the OG/CC on
     responsibilities, personal philosophy and expectations. OG/CCs will emphasize the SOFs
     position as a group level supervisor and that decision authority is delegated to the SOF
     position to ensure the safe accomplishment of the mission.
     6.6.4. The SOF upgrade will consist of two supervised tours of two hours each
     (minimum of 4 hours of training time) with a current and experienced SOF, as defined in
     the unit supplement. The tours will be conducted on two different days in order to
     maximize the chances of the upgradee to observe differing wind and weather conditions.
AFI11-418_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 25 JULY 2013                                                     29


     Upgradees will act as primary SOF on their second upgrade tour. The upgrade tours must
     include the following:
     6.6.4. (AETC) For all undergraduate training units, an experienced SOF will supervise
     the candidate for a minimum of three, 3-hour periods to include an opening and closing
     tour. When practical, schedule two of the three tours with experienced SOFs from
     dissimilar base-assigned aircraft, as applicable. On completion of the third tour, the
     OG/CC may certify the candidate to perform day-only SOF duties. The squadron Letter
     of Xs will be updated to reflect this restricted certification. For night certification, the
     candidate will accomplish a fourth tour with a minimum of 1 hour and 30 minutes
     occurring after official sunset. On completion of the night tour, the day-only SOF
     restriction will be removed from the Letter of Xs.
     6.6.4. (12FTW) 12 OG Only. Each tour will be a minimum of 2 hours and will include
     one full opening and one full closing tour (opening to changeover or changeover to
     closing). Randy SOF trainees will complete one of these tours with a dissimilar aircraft
     SOF (ie. T-1 SOF trainee with an experienced T-38 SOF). Familiarize the trainee with
     all applicable equipment and subjects as outlined in Attachment 12. Document each
     upgrade tour on the SOF upgrade checklist. If the trainee needs additional training tours,
     the experienced SOF will document this in the upgrade checklist and advise the trainee’s
     SOFLO. 12 OG SOFs do not have a night certification requirement.
        6.6.4.1. Familiarization with airfield/heliport procedures, primary and alternate duty
        locations, and local support agencies with emphasis on both unit and aircraft-specific
        operating procedures (AF, HHQ, and local), specifically capabilities and limitations.
        6.6.4.2. Operation of all SOF equipment and radios.
        6.6.4.3. Contact procedures for aircraft and support agencies.
        6.6.4.4. A review of publications and directives available to the SOF.

        6.6.4.7. Procuring/observing weather (to include forecaster duties and priorities)
        information.
        6.6.4.8. Approach/Departure control information.
        6.6.4.9. Tower operations.
     6.6.5. Additionally, prior to being certified as a SOF, upgrades will accomplish the
     following additional training/familiarization items:
        6.6.5.1. Crash/fire/rescue operations.
        6.6.5.2. Explosive ordnance disposal operations.
        6.6.5.2. (AETC) The OG/CC may waive the explosive ordnance disposal training
        requirement.

        requirement.
        6.6.5.5. (12FTW) The requirement for an airfield drivers license qualification is
        waived.
        6.6.5.6. Performance aspects and general characteristics of all base assigned aircraft.
        6.6.5.7. Accomplish a written examination containing a minimum of 25 questions on
        SOF duties, procedures and responsibilities. Minimum passing grade is 85 percent
        with all missed questions reviewed immediately following grading of the exam.
        6.6.5.8. (Added-AETC) When practical, training should include simulators and
        orientation flights in all base-assigned aircraft.
           6.6.5.8.1. (Added-12FTW) SOF nominees are authorized an IEP flight in each
           base-assigned aircraft. IEP flight and simulator missions in aircraft other than the
           trainee’s primary aircraft are encouraged prior to certification as a SOF. Do not
           exceed the training completion deadline established in paragraph 6.6.1 of this
           supplement in an effort to accomplish IEP flights or simulator missions. Neither
           is required for SOF certification. See AFI 11-401 AETC SUP paragraph A7.2.
           for IEP administration.
           6.6.5.8.2. (Added-12FTW) 12 OG Only. T-6 SOF trainees are waived from
           this requirement for West tower duty, but are authorized IEP flights and
           simulators. IEP Flights in the other base-assigned aircraft normally operating
           under OG/CC direction are encouraged and authorized on a non-interference basis
           during or after SOF certification.
        6.6.5.9. (Added-AETC) Procedures required during normal and emergency
        operations, such as status changes, weather recalls, changing weather conditions,
        opposite-direction runway, and barrier procedures.
     6.6.6. The OG/CC will review upgradee training records and approve each upgradee in
     writing prior to the individual performing SOF duties.
        6.6.6.1. (Added-12FTW) Prior to the OG/CC briefing and certification, SOF
        trainees will return their upgrade training checklist to the SOF Program Manager for
        review. After certification by the OG/CC, the SOF Program Manager will maintain
        documentation to include nomination letter, and any MFRs that may be necessary.
        Documentation will remain at OGV until the SOF is decertified or leaves the unit
        (PCS, retirement, separation, etc).
        6.6.6.2. (Added-12FTW) 12 OG Only. Ensure a copy of the completed SOF
        certification letter is delivered to squadron training officers for use in completing the
        AF Form 4348. The 12 OG SOF Program Manager will maintain a master SOF

                    12 OG/479 FTG OPS SUP WEEKEND CHECKLIST

NOTE: The weekend ops sup must be in the local area and immediately available via telephone

   a. Review IMT 4327a for accuracy and ensure Form 104 match the planned itinerary
   b. Ensure crews have your home and cell phone numbers (squadron cell phone if
       necessary/desired)
   c. Inform crews of the weekend recovery window/runway (12 OG: Normally Sunday 1300-
      1600L, East runway)
    d. Inform crews to call command post and/or you with status after each sortie
         1) They should pass on their status and provide billeting information if RON.
         2) Make sure they know to be patched through to you in the event of Code-3 or any
            unusual circumstances.
    e. Determine seating arrangements/configuration on each aircraft scheduled to go
        cross-country.
         1) T-1 seating arrangements (Check with T-1 Maintenance to see if 6th seat is installed, if
         required).
         2) T-38 pod configuration.

2. Build weekend kit:
   a. Copies of IMT 4327a and Form 104
   b. Check out squadron cell phone if necessary/desired
