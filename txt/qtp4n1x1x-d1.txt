                                             INTRODUCTION

1. This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to make a training aid available that will assist
Otolaryngology Surgical Technicians to develop technical skills essential to performing specialized tasks.
The tasks are broken down into teachable elements that help the trainer guide the trainee into becoming
proficient with the task. The QTP will also aid the task certifier when evaluating trainees for task
certification.

2. As a trainer, go through each module (lesson) and identify which QTP tasks are appropriate for the
trainee’s duty position, and then determine the order in which you want the trainee to learn about each
subject area. Direct the trainee to review the training references to better understand the objective of each
module. Go through the steps in the task performance with the trainee and allow for enough time to learn
each step; some objectives may take more time than others. Remember, the objective of the QTP is to
ensure the trainee can perform each task thoroughly. When the trainee receives enough training and is
ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation instructions. Use the performance checklist as
you evaluate each objective. If the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document appropriately
in the individual’s training record. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas
needing more training until the objective is met. Conduct a feedback with the trainee on each module.
After the trainer has ensured and documented that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, a certifier
should evaluate the trainee.

3. The goal of the developers of this QTP is to publish a useful document for trainers and trainees that will
meet Air Force needs under the concepts outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan
(CFETP). We value your expertise in meeting this goal. If you find discrepancies in this QTP, or have
suggestions for its improvement, or if you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP,
please let us know about them. The subject-matter-expert for writing and developing this QTP was:

                                      Lippincott Williams&Wilkins, 2004

EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:                   Personal protective gloves
                                      Microscope with 250mm lens
                                      Examination table or chair with headrest
                                      Suction device (e.g., SMR unit)
                                      Assorted curettes and/or suction catheters, ear wire loops, alligator
                                      forceps, and various sizes of ear specula

OBJECTIVE:                            In a clinical setting, remove cerumen or foreign matter from the ear
                                      canal.

REMARKS/NOTES:                        The principal danger of mechanical removal of debris or foreign
                                      bodies from the ear canal is trauma to the skin of the canal or
                                      perforation of the tympanic membrane.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. Since this task involves direct patient care, ensure the trainee understands the process, knows inherent
risk factors, and is closely supervised during the evaluation. The evaluator will STOP the procedure
immediately and correct the trainee if performance may compromise patient safety. Ensure the
trainee dons all personal protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards/precautions.

3. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without assistance.

4. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

5. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be
documented in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) of the trainee’s CFETP. All recurring evaluation
should be documented using AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using
an approved substitute record.

                                          PERFORMANCE CHECKLIST

 APPLICATION OF MICROSCOPE – CERUMEN LOOP OR SUCTION METHOD                                 SAT     UNSAT
PREPARATORY PHASE
1. Review orders to determine requirement.
2. Assemble all required instruments—curettes, suction device,
irrigation for suction, tissue wipes, etc..
3. Explain the procedure to the patient. Help the patient to relax as much as possible.
4. Position the patient according to the requirements of the microscope. If a sitting
    position is required, have support for patient’s head and neck. If supine, be sure to
    have sufficient neck flexion to keep the patient comfortable.
5. Examine both ear canals with a hand-held otoscope, looking for any unusual anatomy
    or conditions, which would require physician care.
PERFORMANCE PHASE
1. Wash hands. Don PPE.
2. Define the circumference of the obstructing mass—use a wire loop or other
    instrument to loosen the mass from the sides of the EAC.
3. Gently rock the mass to and fro to further loosen it.
4. Impale the mass with an angled hook, or grasp with an alligator forceps and remove
    from canal.
5. If the mass breaks up, remove piece meal. Suction is often helpful with the small,
    mobile pieces.
6. If the mass is too soft to mobilize and grasp, a few drops of Domeboro™ solution
    instilled into the EAC followed by a large bore suction will clear the debris.
7. Perform the same procedure on the opposite ear.
FOLLOW-UP PHASE
1. Be sure the patient is not dizzy (commonly occurs with manipulation or temperature
    change in the EAC) and has no pain.
2. Run irrigation solution through the suction tip to prevent clogging.
FINAL RESULTS/NOTES: If the patient experiences pain or bleeding, evaluation by
the credentialed provider is indicated.




FEEDBACK: Using this checklist as a source of information, discuss the trainee’s performance indicating
strengths, weaknesses, suggested improvements, etc.

5. Examine both ear canals with a hand-held otoscope, looking for any unusual anatomy
    or conditions which would require physician care.
PERFORMANCE PHASE
1. Wash hands. Don PPE.
2. Define the limits of the meatus, explore the furthest posterior limit of the cavity—use a
    wire loop or other instrument to loosen the squamous debris from the sides of the
    bowl. REMEMBER: Anatomy has changed, be sure of what you are removing.
3. Gently tease the layers of skin/wax from the underlying skin.
4. Grasp the sheet of skin/wax with an alligator forceps and remove from canal—try to
    remove in one continuous sheet.
5. If the debris tears apart, remove piece meal. Suction is often helpful with the small,
    mobile pieces.
6. If removal of skin reveals purulent material, obtain consultation from a credentialed
    provider.
7. Perform the same procedure on the opposite ear.
FOLLOW-UP PHASE
1. Be sure the patient is not dizzy (commonly occurs with manipulation or temperature
    change in the EAC) and has no pain.
2. Run irrigation solution through the suction tip to prevent clogging.
