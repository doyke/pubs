PART I
Preface
1. The changing Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) and Air and
Space Expeditionary Aerospace Forces (AEF) environments require vision, preparation, and attention to
ensure people have the right skills and tools to deliver the C4I capabilities and the support required by the
warfighter in meeting the Air Force mission of today and the vision of the future. Declining resources,
expanding diversity of mission, and ever-changing technologies in the Air Force are impacting the
availability of our most valuable resource--people. These factors will continue to exist in the future,
making it essential for the workforce to be effectively and efficiently trained to perform duties within each
skill level of an Air Force Specialty (AFS). To meet the challenges of tomorrow, the Air Force must place
a greater emphasis on career field training. This Cyber Systems Operations Career Field Education and
Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive core training document that identifies life-cycle
training/education requirements, support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the 3D0X2
specialty. The plan is a "training road map" for the career field. It provides personnel a clear career path
to success and makes career field training identifiable, measurable, and budget defensible.
2. This CFETP is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life cycle education
and training requirements, training support resources and minimum core task requirements for this
specialty. The CFETP documents the career field training program and consists of two parts.
Management uses both parts in conjunction with Training Business Area (TBA) to plan, manage and
control training within the career field. NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to
support duty position qualification training.
2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains
how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and
responsibilities, training strategies and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty
qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training and other); Section D indicates resource
constraints (e.g., funds, manpower, equipment, facilities); and Section E identifies transition training guide
requirements for SSgt through MSgt.
2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A: identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and
includes duties, tasks, Training References (TRs) to support training, AETC-conducted training, wartime
course and core task and correspondence course requirements. Section B: contains the Course
Objectives List (COL) and training standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfied training
requirements; Section C: identifies available support materials (e.g., Qualification Training Package,
which may be developed to support proficiency training); Section D identifies a training course index
supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training. Included here are both
mandatory and optional courses; and Section E identifies MAJCOM-unique training requirements
supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs. At
unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan and conduct training commensurate
with the overall goals of this plan.
3. Use of the guidance provided in this CFETP provides the foundation for effective and efficient training
for individuals in this career field at the appropriate points in their careers. This plan enables the Air
Force to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.

                                  Abbreviations/Terms Explained
This section provides a common understanding of the terms that apply to the Cyber Systems Operations
Career Field and Education Training Plan.
Advanced Training (AT). A formal course of training that leads to a technical or supervisory level of an
AFS. Training is for selected Airmen at the advanced level of an AFS.
Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF). The AEF is the Air Force’s methodology for organizing,
training, equipping, and sustaining rapidly responsive air and space forces to meet defense strategy
requirements. Through the AEF, consisting of enabler and tempo banded capabilities, the Air Force
supports defense strategy requirements using a combination of both permanently assigned and rotational
(allocated) forces.
Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF). The AETF is the Air Force’s primary warfighting
organization and the means by which we present forces to a Joint Forces Commander (JFC). When
established, AETFs will form up under the designated Air Force component headquarters.
Air Education Training Command (AETC). Responsible for the recruiting, training and education of Air
Force personnel. AETC also provides pre-commissioning, professional military and continuing education.
Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM). Representative appointed by the respective HQ USAF
Deputy Chief of Staff or Under Secretariat to ensure that assigned Air Force specialties are trained and
utilized to support Air Force mission requirements.
Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD). The official directory for all military enlisted
classification descriptions, codes, and identifiers. Establishes the occupational structure of the Air Force
enlisted force. The occupational structure is flexible to permit enlisted personnel to specialize and
develop their skills and abilities while allowing the Air Force to meet changing mission requirements.
Individual enlisted personnel have a joint responsibility with commanders and supervisors at all levels to
fully develop their abilities consistent with Air Force needs and within the established patterns of
specialization.

Air Force Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS). A comprehensive task list that describes a particular
job type or duty position. Supervisors use the AFJQS to document task qualification. The tasks on
AFJQSs are common to all persons serving in the described duty position.

unit to qualify or aid qualification in a duty position, program, or on a piece of equipment. It may be
printed, computer-based, or other audiovisual media.
Air Force Specialty (AFS). A group of positions (with the same title and code) that require common
qualifications.
Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP). The actions and methods that implement
joint doctrine that describe how forces will be employed in joint operations. They are promulgated by the
Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff in coordination with the Combatants Commands, Services and the
JCS.
Air University Associate-to-Baccalaureate Cooperative (AU ABC). Allows Airmen to turn a
Community College of the Air Force Associates Degree into a Bachelors Degree from an accredited
university. The ABC program has established a partnership with various civilian higher-education
institutions to offer four-year degree opportunities via distance learning. The participating schools will
accept all of the credits earned by Airmen who have attained a CCAF degree and apply them to a
Bachelors degree related to their Air Force specialty.
Air University/AFCDA (Air Force Career Development Academy). The result of a reorganization of Air
Force Institute for Advanced Distributed Learning (AFIADL); provides access to the Extension Course
Institute.
Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). A CFETP is a comprehensive core training
document that identifies: life-cycle education and training requirements; training support resources; and

                                                      5
minimum core task requirements for a specialty. The CFETP aims to give personnel a clear path and
instill a sense of industry in career field training. CFETPs are officially posted at http://www.e-
publishing.af.mil/.
Certification. A formal indication of an individual’s ability to perform a task to required standards.
Certifying Official. A person assigned by the commander to determine an individual’s ability to perform
a task to required standards.
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Task Qualification
Training (TQT). CBRNE TQT ensures personnel maintain proficiency in performing mission-critical tasks
in a CBRNE environment. See AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning
and Operations, and AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear, Biological, Chemical and Conventional (NBCC) Defense
Operations and Standards, for additional information/requirements.
Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) Code. CEM codes identify all chief master sergeant positions in the
Enlisted Classification Structure. They also identify chief master sergeants who, through extensive
experience and training, have demonstrated managerial ability to plan, direct, coordinate, implement, and
control a wide range of work activity. Some managerial duties and responsibilities that are common to all
chief enlisted managers are: managing and directing personnel resource activities; interpreting and
enforcing policy and applicable directives; establishing control procedures to meet work goals and
standards; recommending or initiating actions to improve functional operation efficiency; planning and
programming work commitments and schedules; developing plans regarding facilities, supplies, and
equipment procurement and maintenance.
Cloud Computing. The use of computing resources (hardware and software) that are delivered as a
service over a network (typically the Internet).
Collaboration. Collaboration is the interaction among two or more individuals encompassing a variety of
behaviors, including communication, information sharing, coordination, cooperation, problem-solving and
negotiation.
Collaborative Tools. Collaborative tools consist of various web-based technologies including advanced
white boarding, groupware, and facilitation. Collaborative capabilities assist significantly with managing

digital information. This digital information is often referred to as content or, to be precise, digital content.
Digital content may take the form of text, such as documents, multimedia files, such as audio or video
files, or any other file type that follows a content life cycle that requires management.
Continuation Training. Additional advanced training that exceeds the minimum upgrade training
requirements and emphasizes present or future duty assignments.
Core Task. A task AFCFMs identify as a minimum qualification requirement for everyone within an
AFSC, regardless of duty position. Core task may be specified for a particular skill level or in general
across the AFSC. Guidance for using core task can be found in the applicable CFETP narrative.

personnel and equipment within a specific functional area to support the operational planning and
execution. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to, developing and reviewing policy; developing,
managing, and maintaining Unit Type Codes (UTC); developing criteria for and monitoring readiness
reporting; force posturing; and analysis. At each level of responsibility (Headquarters Air Force,
MAJCOM, Air Component, FOA, DRU, and Unit), the FAM should be the most highly knowledgeable and
experienced person within the functional area and have the widest range of visibility over the functional
area readiness and capability issues.
Functional Manager. An individual assigned collateral responsibility for training, classification, utilization,
and career development of enlisted personnel. AFSC Functional Managers exist at MAJCOM, NAF and
base level. (AFI 33-101, Commanders Guidance and Responsibilities)
Global Command and Control System (GCCS). An automated information system designed to support
deliberate and crisis planning with the use of an integrated set of analytic tools and the flexible data
transfer capabilities. GCCS will become the single C4I system to support the warfighter from foxhole to
command post.
Global Combat Support System – Air Force (GCSS-AF). An enterprise infrastructure program
established to develop, integrate, and deploy combat support information capabilities. The mission of
GCSS-AF is to provide timely, accurate, and trusted Agile Combat Support (ACS) information to Joint and
Air Force commanders, their staffs, and ACS personnel at all ranks and echelons, with the appropriate
level of security needed to execute the Air Force mission throughout the spectrum of military operations.
GCSS-AF is the means by which ACS functional systems will be modernized and integrated to improve
business processes supported on a single robust network-centric infrastructure. In addition to integrating
combat support applications, GCSS-AF also provides core enterprise services such as a common user
presentation through the AF Portal, Enterprise Information Management (Workflow, Records
Management, Document Management, Knowledge Management, and Collaboration), and an enterprise
data warehouse.
Global Information Grid (GIG). The globally interconnected, end-to-end set of information capabilities,
associated processes, and personnel for collecting, processing, storing, disseminating and managing
information on demand to warfighters, policy makers, and support personnel. The GIG includes all
owned and leased communications and computing systems and services, software (including
applications), data, security services, and other associated services necessary to achieve Information
Superiority. The GIG supports all Department of Defense, National Security, and related Intelligence
community missions and functions (strategic, operational, tactical, and business), in war and in peace.
The GIG provides capabilities from all operating locations (bases, posts, camps, stations, facilities, mobile
platforms, and deployed sites). The GIG provides interfaces to coalition, allied, and non-DOD users and
systems.
Go/No-Go. The “Go” is the stage at which a trainee has gained enough skill, knowledge, and experience
to perform the tasks without supervision, meeting the task standard. “No-Go” is the stage at which the
trainee has not gained enough skill, knowledge, and experience to perform task without supervision, does
not meet task standard.


                                                      8
Individual Training Plan (ITP). Use Training Business Area (TBA) to document training. TBA reflects
past and current qualifications, and is used to determine training requirements. It is intended to be a
complete history of past training and current qualifications. Supervisors will ensure all documentation is
accurate and comprehensive.

storage, protection, and disposition. (DoDD 8000.01, Management of the Department of Defense
Information Enterprise).
Information Management (IM). The planning, budgeting, manipulating, and controlling of information
throughout its life cycle. Joint Publication 3-0, Joint Operations, further defines IM as the function of
managing an organization’s information resources by the handling of knowledge acquired by one or many
different individuals and organizations in a way that optimizes access by all who have a share in that
knowledge or a right to that knowledge.
Information Resources Management (IRM). The process of managing information resources to
accomplish agency missions and to improve agency performance (e.g., the reduction of information
collection burdens on the public). (AFPD 33-1, Information Resources Management).
Information Systems (IS). Set of information resources organized for the collection, storage,
processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, disposition, display, or transmission of information.
(DoD 8500.2)

mandatory upgrade training to qualified officers. (AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program)
Instructional System Development (ISD). A deliberate and orderly (but flexible) process for planning,
developing, implementing, and managing instructional systems. It ensures personnel are taught in a cost
efficient way to become educated on the knowledge, skills, and abilities essential for successful job
performance.
Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). JTRS will link the power of the Global Information Grid (GIG) to
the warfighter in applying fire effects and achieving overall battlefield superiority. By developing and
implementing an open architecture of cutting-edge radio waveform technology, multiple radio types (e.g.,
handheld, ground-mobile, airborne, maritime, etc.) are now allowed to communicate with one another.
The ultimate goal is to produce a family of interoperable, modular, software-defined radios that operate as
nodes in a network to ensure secure wireless communication and networking services for mobile and
fixed forces. These goals extend to U.S. allies, joint and coalition partners, and disaster response
personnel.
Knowledge. Information from multiple domains that has been synthesized, through inference or
deduction, into meaning or understanding that was not previously known. This includes: explicit
knowledge, which can be easily articulated, codified, and stored; and tacit knowledge, which is based on
personal experience, expertise, and judgment. Tacit knowledge is more challenging to capture and share
than explicit knowledge.
Knowledge Management (KM). Handling, directing, governing, or controlling of natural knowledge
processes within an organization in order to achieve the goals and objectives of the organization.
Knowledge Operations (KO). Application and adaptation of Knowledge Management (KM) into
daily AF operations to enable information/decision superiority. KO leverages the interaction of people,
processes, and EIS technologies to capture, store, organize, share, and control tacit and explicit
knowledge, ensuring all mission execution processes have access to relevant cross-functional
information in a collaborative, timely, and contextual manner.
Knowledge Training. Training used to provide a base of knowledge for task performance. It may also
be used in lieu of task performance when the training capability does not exist. Learning gained through
knowledge rather than hands-on experience. (AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program)
Major Command (MAJCOM). A MAJCOM represents a major Air Force subdivision having a specific
portion of the Air Force mission. Each MAJCOM is directly subordinate to HQ USAF. MAJCOMs are
interrelated and complementary, providing offensive, defensive, and support elements.

                                                      9
Master Task Listing (MTL). A comprehensive list (100%) of all tasks performed within a work center and
consisting of the current CFETP or AFJQS and locally developed AF Forms 797 (as a minimum). Should
include tasks required for deployment and/or UTC requirements.
Master Training Plan (MTP). Employs a strategy for ensuring the completion of all work center job
requirements by using a MTL and provides milestones for task, CDC completion, and prioritizes
deployment/UTC, home station training tasks, upgrade, and qualification tasks.
Occupational Analysis Report (OAR). A detailed report showing the results of an occupational survey
of tasks performed within a particular AFSC.
On-the-Job Training (OJT). Hands-on, over-the-shoulder training conducted to certify personnel in both
upgrade (skill level award) and job qualification (duty position) training.
Proficiency Training. Additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or
on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum
required for upgrade.
Qualification Training. Hands-on, task performance based training designed to qualify Airmen in a
specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process
and is designed to provide skills training required to do the job.
Records Management. The planning, controlling, directing, organizing, training, promoting, and other
managerial activities involved in records creation, maintenance and use, and disposition in order to
achieve adequate and proper documentation of the policies and transactions of the Federal Government
and effective and economical management of agency operations. (AFPD 33-3, Information Management)
Resource Constraints. Resource deficiencies (such as money, facilities, time, manpower, and
equipment) that preclude desired training from being delivered.
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). A services oriented architecture (SOA) environment makes it
easier and faster to build and deploy information capabilities that directly serve the needs of the Air Force.
SOA is an information technology environment where the following occur: Mission and business
processes are supported by information assets. Information assets are delivered to consumers through
content delivery services. Content delivery services and other services interact to support process
threads or to deliver information assets. Core services, such as infrastructure and presentation services,
are independent of the content delivery services. Net-centric protocols and services allow federating and
re-using both content delivery and core services for multiple users, domains, and information sources.
Specialized Training Package and COMSEC Qualification Training Package. A composite of lesson
plans, test material, instructions, policy, doctrine and procedures necessary to conduct training. These
packages are prepared by AETC, validated by CYSS COMSEC policy branch and administered by
qualified communications security (COMSEC) maintenance personnel.
Specialty Training Requirements Team. A meeting chaired by the AFCFM with MAJCOM FMs, AETC
Training Managers, Subject Matter Experts (SME) and HQ AETC Occupational Analysis Division (OAD)
in attendance. Typically held three months prior to a Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) to
finalize any CFETP changes or enlisted classification directory descriptions.
Specialty Training Standard (STS). An Air Force publication that describes an Air Force specialty in
terms of tasks and knowledge that an Airman in that specialty may be expected to perform or to know on
the job. Also identifies the training provided to achieve a 3-, 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level within an enlisted AFS.
It further serves as a contract between AETC and the functional user to show which of the overall training
requirements for an Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) are taught in formal schools and correspondence
courses.
Standard. An exact value, a physical entity, or an abstract concept established and defined by authority,
custom, or common consent to serve as a reference, model, or rule in measuring quantities or qualities,
establishing practices or procedures, or evaluating results. It is a fixed quantity or quality.
System Training Plan (STP). A living document that explains what training is needed for a system and
how to obtain the training.


                                                       10
Task Module (TM). A group of tasks performed together within an AFS that require common knowledge,
skills, and abilities. TMs are identified by an identification code and a statement.
Total Force. All collective components (active, reserve, guard, and civilian elements) of the United
States Air Force.
Training Advisory Group (TAG). Chaired by the AFCFM and attended by the MAJCOM, selected DRU
and FOA functional managers. The TAG sets training goals and priorities, reviews training programs and
evaluates emerging training technologies. The group meets, as required, to prioritize training product
development.

with global, real-time visibility into qualifications, certifications and training status of communications
professionals. TBA supports base, wing and work center training management activities by
automating business processes and capabilities to eliminate paper-based practices. The system
centralizes management of training task data, provides user access to CFETPs/JQSs and increases
security through a single AF Portal log on.
Training Capability. The ability of a unit or base to provide training. Authorities consider the availability
of equipment, qualified trainers, and study reference materials, and so on in determining a unit's training
capability.
Training Planning Team (TPT). Comprised of the same personnel as a U&TW, TPTs are more
intimately involved in training development and the range of issues examined is greater than in the U&TW
forum.
Training Requirements Analysis (TRA). A detailed analysis of tasks for a particular AFSC to be
included in the training decision process.
Training Setting. The type of forum in which training is provided (formal resident school, on-the-job, field
training, mobile training team, self-study, etc.).
Trusted Thin Client (TTC). A computer or a computer program which depends on another computer (or
server) to fulfill its traditional computational roles while utilizing security policy to prevent cross domain
contamination.
Unit Type Code (UTC). A five-character alphanumeric code identifying a specific force package of
personnel and/or equipment. The UTC is the means for linking logistics and manpower details within a
unit type and is used to communicate force data. The UTC represents a wartime capability designed to
fill a valid contingency requirement.
Upgrade Training. Training that leads to the award of a higher skill level.
Utilization and Training Pattern. A depiction of the training provided to and the jobs performed by
personnel throughout their tenure within a career field or AFS. There are two types of patterns: 1)
Current pattern, which is based on the training provided to incumbents and the jobs to which they have
been and are assigned; and 2) Alternate pattern, which considers proposed changes in manpower,
personnel, and training policies.
Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW). A forum of the AFCFM, MAJCOM Functional Managers,
subject matter experts (SME), and AETC training personnel that determines career ladder training
requirements.
Wartime Tasks. Those tasks that must be taught when courses are accelerated in a wartime
environment. In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3- level course in a
streamlined training environment. These tasks are only for those career fields that still need them applied
to their schoolhouse tasks.




                                                      11
Workflow. A series of steps necessary for the initiation, tracking and delivery of services or outputs with
the capability to cut across existing or future organizational boundaries. Furthermore, web-based
workflow products allow electronic coordination, staffing, and task management of documents and files.
They are relational to an electronic version of the Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) and other AF/DoD forms
used for routing/collection of information. Automation provides the capability to suspense and track
correspondence through the workflow process and provides action officers and document originators
status on their packages. Provides users the capabilities to comply with structured electronic workflow
processes and the flexibility to create/develop ad hoc workflow courses of actions. Future use of
standardized EIM tools will enhance usability and eliminate legacy methods.

Section A - General Information
1. Purpose of the CFETP. This CFETP provides the information necessary for AFCFMs, MAJCOM
Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop,
manage and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program. The plan outlines the initial
skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training those individuals in AFSC 3D0X2 should
receive in order to develop and progress throughout their careers. Initial skills training is the AFS specific
training an individual receives upon entry into the AF or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the
3-skill level. This training is provided by the 336th Training Squadron (TRS) at Keesler AFB, MS.
Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, Career Development
Course (CDC) completion and correspondence courses required for award of the 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level.
Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a
specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It
is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job. Advanced training is
formal specialty training used for selected airmen. Proficiency training is additional training, either in-
residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to
increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has several
purposes, some of which are:
1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, develop, manage, and conduct a career field training
program. Also, ensures that established training is provided at the appropriate point in an individual's
career.
1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and
recommends training throughout each phase of an individual's career.
1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of the training, and provides the
training medium.
1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact implementation of the desired career field training
program.
2. Use of the CFETP. The CFETP is maintained by the 3DXXX Air Force Career Field Manager
(AFCFM), AF/A3CF/A6CF. MAJCOM FMs and AETC review the plan annually to ensure currency and
accuracy and forward recommended changes to the AFCFM. Using the list of courses in Part II, they
determine whether duplicate training exists and take steps to eliminate/prevent duplicate efforts. Career
field training managers at all levels use the plan to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive training
program is available for each individual in the career ladder.
2.1. AETC training personnel develop/revise formal resident and exportable training based upon
requirements established by the users and documented in the STS. They also develop procurement and
acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.
2.2. MAJCOM FMs ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial skill and
upgrade requirements. They also identify the needed AFJQSs/AFQTPs to document unique upgrade and
continuation training requirements. Requirements are satisfied through OJT, resident training, contract
training, or exportable courseware/courses. MAJCOM developed training to support this AFSC must be
included into this plan.
2.3. 81 TRSS/TSQ Qualification Training Flight (Q-Flight) personnel develop training packages
(AFJQSs/AFQTPs) based on requests submitted by the MAJCOMs and according to the priorities
assigned by the AFCFM.
2.4. Unit level training managers and supervisors manage and control progression through the career
field by ensuring individuals complete the mandatory training requirements for upgrade specified in this
plan and supplemented by their MAJCOM. The list of courses in Part II is used as a reference for
planning continuation or career enhancement training.
2.5. Submit recommended CFETP improvements/corrections to the AFSC Training Manager at 336
TRS/TRR, 108 Phantom Street, Keesler AFB MS 39534-2235 or call DSN 597-4307. To contact
electronically send email to: 336TRS/TRR@us.af.mil.

                                                      13
3. Coordination and Approval of the CFETP. The AFCFM is the approval authority. MAJCOM
representatives and AETC training personnel coordinate on the career field training requirements. The
AETC training manager initiates an annual review of this document by AETC and MAJCOM functional
managers to ensure the CFETP’s currency and accuracy by using the list of courses in Part II to eliminate
duplicate training.

5. Skills and Career Progression. Adequate training is essential to timely progression of personnel
from apprentice to superintendent skill levels and plays an important role in the Air Force’s ability to
accomplish its mission. Everyone involved in training must do their part to plan, manage, and conduct
effective training programs. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP and the 3D0X2, CYBER
SYSTEMS OPERATIONS CAREER PATH table will ensure individuals receive viable training at
appropriate points in their career. Airmen should also review career progression information tailored to
their grade and AFSC on My Enlisted Development Plan (MyEDP), accessible through the Air Force
Portal (AFP). Mandatory requirements for upgrade training to each skill level are covered in Section C.




6. Training Decisions. This CFETP was developed to encapsulate an entire spectrum of training
requirements for the Cyber Systems Operations career field, using a building block approach (simple to
complex). Included in this spectrum is the strategy of when, where, and how to meet the training
requirements. The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and
eliminate a disjointed approach to training.
6.1. Proficiency Training. This training is job qualification for an assigned duty position. Additional
qualification training becomes necessary when personnel transfer to another duty position, the unit
mission changes, a new personnel program comes on board, or any time changes in techniques or
procedures occur.
6.1.1. The first 14 task headers of the STS are considered common core to the entire cyber support
career field. Each 3DXXX AFSC has the same 1-14 tasks, although each task is not core to each AFSC.
Dashed tasks are available in TBA for individual training plans (ITP) in the event an Airman performs the
tasks.

PART II
Section A - Specialty Training Standard
1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for the 3-level class
beginning 28 July, 2014.
2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, and this STS:
2.1. Lists in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge,
and technical references (TR) necessary for airman to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.
Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies, by asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements. NOTE: Core
tasks are minimum task training requirements for upgrade to the 5-skill level.
2.2. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge
training requirements. Use automated training management systems to document technician
qualifications, if available. For initial certification or transcribing documentation complete the columns in
accordance to AFI 36-2201.
2.3. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the proficiency to
be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task/knowledge and the career
knowledge provided by the correspondence course. See Air University catalog maintained at
http://www.au.af.mil/au/afiadl/ for current CDC listings.
2.4. Qualitative Requirements. Attachment 1 contains the tasks, knowledge, and proficiency levels
referenced in paragraph 2. Columns are marked with a proficiency code to indicate subjects taught. An X
in the proficiency code column indicates a lack of student man years and instructor resources. Trainees
without prerequisites specified in Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) cannot be
expected to meet proficiency levels indicated.
2.5. Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623,
Individual Training Record folder, and used according to AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.
2.6. Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System
(WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKT) are developed at the Airmen Advancement Division by senior
NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS
subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to
higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the Enlisted Promotion References
and Requirements Catalog. Individual responsibilities are listed in chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, Air Force
Military Personnel Testing System. WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Reserve
Forces.
3. Recommendations. Comments and recommendations are invited concerning the quality of AETC
training. A Training Feedback Hotline has been installed for the supervisors' convenience. For a quick
response to concerns, call our Training Feedback Hotline at DSN 597-4566, fax us at DSN 597-3790, or
e-mail us at 81trg-tget@keesler.af.mil. Reference this STS and identify the specific area of concern
(paragraph, training standard element, etc).

NOTE 1: Dashed items in this CTS are not part of the original CTS created at the March 2009 IT
Fundamentals conference however, they are the specific objectives taught in the IT Fundamentals course
designed to meet the CTS requirements.
NOTE 2: Unless otherwise stated, students may be allowed two assists from the instructor and still
successfully achieve the proper level of proficiency. An instructor assist is anytime an instructor must
intercede to provide guidance to a student which leads to a satisfactory completion of the objective or to
prevent the student from continuing in a manner that will lead to an unsatisfactory conclusion, safety
violation, or damage to equipment.
NOTE 3: All 3-level tasks will be trained if a wartime surge is ordered.

* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a
specific task. (Example: b and 1b)
** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific
   task, or for a subject common to several tasks. This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency
   training is provided in the course or CDC.
X This mark is used alone in course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.
NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime.

* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.
(Example: b and 1b)
** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a
   subject common to several tasks. This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the
   course or CDC.
(-) This mark is used alone in Proficiency Codes Course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in
   resources.
NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime.
(-) When this code is used in the Core & Wartime Tasks Column it indicates that the qualification is a local determination.
(5) When this code is used in the Core & Wartime Tasks Column it indicates the CFM has mandated this task as a core 5-level requirement.
    The training to satisfy this requirement is either provided through OJT, CBTs, CDCs, or a combination.
(7) When this code is used in the Core & Wartime Tasks Column it indicates the CFM has mandated this task as a core 7-level requirement.
    The training to satisfy this requirement is either provided through OJT, CBTs, CDCs, or a combination.
(5*) When this code is used in the Core & Wartime Tasks Column it indicates the CFM has selected this task as core 5-level tasks if loaded
     to the individual’s ITA. This code indicates that training to satisfy this requirement is normally provided through OJT.
(7*) When this code is used in the Core & Wartime Tasks Column it indicates the CFM has selected this task as core 7-level tasks if loaded
     to the individual’s ITA. This code indicates that training to satisfy this requirement is normally provided through OJT.


    CDC column. The use of proficiency coding indicates the level of knowledge training provided by the
    CDCs, The CDC column will now identify the subject knowledge level covered in the CDC. Information
    pertaining to the meaning of the code can be located in the STS coding system table.

    CFETP versus AFJQS task coding. AFJQSs/AFQTPs annotated in the CFETP with a skill level
    denotes the AFJQS is mandatory. Within the AFJQS are individual tasks that are coded either “X” or “X*”.
    If the tasks are coded “X,” they are mandatory. If coded “X*,” they are duty position specific.

Section B - Course Objective List
4. Measurement. Each objective is indicated as follows: W indicates task or subject knowledge which is
measured using a written test, PC indicates required task performance which is measured with a
performance progress check, and PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and
performance elements using a written test and a progress check.

5. Standard. The standard is 70% on written examinations. Standards for performance measurement
are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist. Instructor assistance is
provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the
behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.

6. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the
student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially
proficient). The student can also determine step by step procedures for doing the task.
