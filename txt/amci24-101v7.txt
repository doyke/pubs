                                            Chapter 1

                                   PROGRAM DEFINITION

1.1. APEX is an Aerial Port aircraft cargo loading program. APEX Load Directors are
authorized to supervise the on/offload of cargo to C-17/C-5 aircraft without the presence of a
Loadmaster. APEX provides Aerial Port leadership with the flexibility to determine the best
time to on/offload an aircraft, based on duty schedule and air flow, while facilitating the decrease
of aircraft ground time and providing more efficient use of crew duty day. APEX is a product of
the AMC Velocity Initiative (VI) from 2005.
1.2. Load Directors attend a two week formal course taught by instructors from the USAF
Expeditionary Center. C-17 APEX classes are held at Charleston AFB and Joint Base Lewis
McChord. C-5 APEX classes are held at Travis AFB. At each location aerial port APEX
instructors follow-up the classroom instruction with a one-week aircraft specific ―hands-on‖
training class.
1.3. Load Director responsibilities on the C-17 aircraft consist of operating cargo door and
ramp, aircraft stabilizer struts, aircraft winch, and oversight of on/offloading operations. Load
Director’s responsibilities on the C-5 aircraft consist of operating the aircraft winch and
oversight of the front and aft door on/offloading operations. Load Directors are responsible for
all loading operations in accordance with (IAW) technical orders, Air Mobility Command
Instructions (AMCI) and related guidance. Maintenance will provide support for all C-5 door and
ramp operations. APEX personnel are not qualified to load cargo rigged for airdrop and P-NAF
designated missions.

   calculate Zero Fuel Weight Center of Balance.
   Note: "Load directors have overall control until relieved by the outbound
   loadmaster(s). A coordination briefing is required prior to the loadmaster
   assuming overall control."
8.8. CHECKLISTS: Checklists are a pivotal instrument for safety and training which will
require continual review by unit STAN/EVAL personnel. Two loading checklists exist,
appended and expanded, both are applicable to all ground loading operations. During daily
operations APEX personnel will use, as a minimum, the abbreviated checklists in AMCI 24-101,
V7, CL-1, or CL-2, (for C-17, C-5, respectively) to ensure required APEX loading actions are
accomplished. These checklists are derived from applicable -1 and -9 Technical Orders. When
conflicts occur between checklists and the aircraft technical orders, the technical orders always
take precedence. See AMCI 24-101V7, CL-1, C-17 APEX Load Directors Checklist and AMCI
24-101V7, CL-2, C-5 APEX Load Directors Checklist.

                AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE UNIT RESPONSIBILITIES

10.1. Maintenance support at APEX designated bases and locations where APEX operations
will be performed is critical to the success of APEX.
10.2. Release aircraft for loading to ATOC. An aircraft released for on/offloading indicates
that no maintenance work to the aircraft is planned or presently underway that will hamper
loading operations.
10.3. Coordinate with ATOC to ensure the aircraft is released for loading in the proper
configuration.
10.4. Provide Ground Power Unit (GPU) or Aircraft Power Unit (APU) as required.
10.5. Operate aircraft systems as required and monitor safety.
10.6. Maintain communication capability with Load Director during loading operations.
10.7. Supervise all evacuation operations in the event of an aircraft systems or petroleum, oil,
and lubricants (POL)-related ground emergency. The aircraft maintainer and/or Load Director
will stop all loading operations when an unsafe condition exists.

                                AIRCREW LOADMASTERS

11.1. Aircrew will accept load based on applicable -9 Technical Orders, not personal preference.
11.2. Compute the DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F–Transport/Tactical,
also referred to as the ―Form F‖.
11.3. When utilized, the APEX Load Brief Sheet will be provided to the Loadmaster at
crew show. The optional form will be completed and signed by the primary Load Director when
used.
11.4. On quick turn missions loadmasters are responsible for on/offloading their own aircraft,
unless pre-coordinated with ATOC on in bound call.
11.5. When aircrew training or evaluations are required, ATOC will be informed on inbound
call that APEX is not necessary.

12.1. HQ AMC/A4TC will coordinate with the deployed site leadership on the number of APEX
certified personnel required to successfully accomplish a deployed APEX program.
12.2. HQ AMC/A4OL will ensure the correct information is included in the line remarks to
support deployed APEX locations.
12.3. Aerial port personnel selected to perform deployed APEX Load Director duties must meet
all currency requirements prior to their departure, and ensure currency for the duration of
deployment.
12.4. Deployed APEX Load Directors will hand carry AMC Form 346, a copy of AMC Form
34, APEX checklists, and all appropriate safety gear to carry out their APEX responsibilities.
   12.4.1. All paperwork given to APEX Program Managers at deployed locations should be
   kept on file for the duration of the individual’s deployment.
12.5. Deployed Load Directors will possess the capability to load aircraft at their new location
after sufficient flight line orientation actions are completed.
12.6. This is an AMC specific program; the determination of future deployment policies and
locations related to APEX personnel will be determined by HQ AMC/A4T. Note: Deployed
APEX Program Manager will notify deployed Load Directors of any APEX messages,
FCIFs/FCBs updates. In the event an evaluation is required and no STAN/EVAL personnel are
available, coordinate with HQ AMC/A4TC APEX Program Manager for waiver authority, or if
required an evaluation from HQ AMC/A3V.
