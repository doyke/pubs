SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision reflects extensive changes due to criteria and updated guidance in AFMAN 91-201,
Explosive Safety Standards, and must be completely reviewed.
1. References. AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. The Commander, 46th Test Wing (46 TW/CC) is responsible for explosives operations
     on the 46 TW parking ramp (except A and B rows); Sugar row; trim pads; Hardstand (HS) 1;
     Taxiway Mike West; and Hot Gunlines (HGL) 1 and 3.
     2.2. The Commander, AETC 33d Fighter Wing (33 FW/CC) is responsible for explosives
     operations on the 33 FW aircraft parking ramp; Live Ordnance Load Area (LOLA) and
     Taxiway C when occupied with 33 FW assets.
     2.3. The Commander, 53 Wing (53 WG/CC) is responsible for explosives operations on the
     LOLA when occupied with 53 WG assets and sponsored TDY aircraft.
     2.4. The Commander, 9th Special Operations Squadron (9 SOS/CC) is responsible for
     explosives operations on the 9th SOS ramp; and on A and B rows of the 46 TW ramp.
     2.5. The Directorate of Contracting (AAC/PK) and the Operational Contracting Division
     (AAC/PKO) will include compliance with this publication in terms and conditions of
     contracts, statements of work (SOWs), etc., when they are identified as applicable by the
     requiring organization.
        2.5.1. The requiring organization will coordinate with the Weapons Safety office
        (AAC/SEW) and 46 OSS Airfield Management Office (46 OSS/OSAM) for all TDY
        aircraft deploying to Eglin for explosive aircraft parking and planned munitions loading.
3. Requirements for Aircraft Loaded with Explosives:
     3.1. The 46 TW Maintenance Operations Center (46 MXG/MOC) and/or the 33 FW
     Maintenance Operations Center (33 FW/CPW) will be notified of munitions deliveries and
     when the aircraft loading is complete. Each Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will
     provide a flying schedule to the Fire Alarm Communications Center (FACC), 96 CES/CEFC
     and advise them of any changes or deviations to the posted schedules. The FACC will also
     be notified when munitions are loaded or unloaded on aircraft located in areas authorized in
     Section 8 below; give the aircraft tail number, parking location, and hazard class/division of
     the explosives. Posting of explosives fire symbols for explosive loaded aircraft is not
     required provided the provisions of this paragraph are complied with. If the provisions of
     this paragraph cannot be complied with, post appropriate fire symbols at each aircraft.
     Notifications to the MOC or posting of the fire symbols are the responsibility of the
     personnel loading the aircraft, to include TDY aircraft and personnel. Normally installed
     explosives on aircraft (i.e. ejection seat, canopies) does not constitute explosive loaded.
     3.2. Base Operations (46 OSS/OSAM) will notify AAC/SEW and 96 CES/CEFC of all
     arrivals and departures of explosives loaded cargo aircraft to include Net Explosive Weight
     (NEW) and Hazard/Class Division (HC/D) of the explosives.
EGLINAFBMAN91-202 26 JANUARY 2011                                                               3


   3.3. The 96th Logistics Readiness Squadron (96 LRS) will comply with the requirements of
   paragraph 3.1 or post explosives fire symbols at explosives loaded cargo aircraft as
   applicable.
4. Authorized Explosive Laden Vehicle Routes:
   4.1. Vehicles transporting explosives to and from the designated loading areas on Eglin Air
   Force Base, Duke Field and Eglin Test Ranges will be restricted to designated explosives
   laden vehicle routes. Primary routes will always be used before alternate routes. Primary
   and alternate munitions delivery routes are shown on the Eglin, Eglin Reservation, and Duke
   Field D-8 maps. These maps are available through 96 CEG along with the Eglin GEOBASE
   Tab Maps at https://96ceg.eglin.af.mil/website/asp/tabmaps.asp or on the AAC Safety CoP
   located at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Filter=OO-SE-AA-
   C1&FolderID=OO-SE-AA-C1-16-9&Tab=0. Due to the various munitions delivery/pickup
   areas serviced by the 46 TW munitions storage area, further definition of the alternate
   munitions delivery routes will be developed as the need arises. Where alternate munitions
   delivery routes require crossing an active runway, radio contact with the airfield tower is
   mandatory prior to crossing.
   4.2. Specific routes are not required when transporting munitions to and from licensed
   storage/operating locations on-base. However, vehicles must take the most direct route
   utilizing the explosives laden routes to the maximum extent possible.
   4.3. If munitions must be transported through the city of Fort Walton Beach, contact the Fort
   Walton Beach Fire Department prior to delivery at 850-833-9565 from 8:00 AM-5:00 PM or
   850-833-9571 after hours (on duty Battalion Chief). Notifications will be accomplished
   when transporting Hazard/Class Division 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 or over 1000 pounds aggregate weight
   of 1.4 munitions, hazardous chemicals, and other dangerous articles through the city.
   Notification will include routes to be taken.
       4.3.1. Munitions Control will make the notifications for 46 MXS/MWMW.
5. Authorized Arm/De-arm Areas: Launch/recovery operations will be performed in the areas
immediately adjacent to the active launch and recovery ends of the runways as directed by each
maintenance control unit. Locations are specified on the Eglin D-8 map. Deviations to approved
arm/de-arm locations will be approved by AAC Safety, Airfield Management, and the
responsible Commander.
6. Weapons Load Crew Training/Ground Mounts: Training missiles with live guidance and
control (G&C) units can be utilized in support of weapons load crew training, provided they are
delivered at the beginning of the training day and picked up when training is completed. Test
munitions containing small amounts of 1.4 explosives may be located in hangars 71, 102, 103,
and 130 for aircraft compatibility tests. Obtain approval from AAC/SEW and notify after
munitions are picked up.
7. Personnel Qualification/Certification: Only qualified/certified personnel will be permitted
to install, remove, or handle explosives. When civilian contractor personnel and/or assets are
involved in loading or testing, the requiring activity will coordinate and obtain approval through
the Chief of Safety (AAC/SE) and Munitions Maintenance Squadron, Munitions Flight (46
MXS/MXMW). Upon request, AAC/SE will provide guidance to project personnel, supporting
 4                                                EGLINAFBMAN91-202 26 JANUARY 2011


activities, and contractor representatives to make sure that maximum safety measures are taken
in all operations.
8. Designated Aircraft Parking Areas: All aircraft parking spots, including trim pads used to
support the operational requirements of the 46 TW, 53 Wing, 33 FW, 9 SOS, and transient
aircraft are authorized for carrying and/or loading/unloading the specific munitions listed in
sections 8.1 thru 8.4 below IAW AFMAN 91-201, paragraph 12.47. The quantity being
loaded/unloaded is limited to one aircraft load. Standard airfield and aircraft separation distances
apply. Aircraft carrying or to be loaded/unloaded with other munitions must be parked in an
approved explosives loading area as stipulated in Section Nine below. Explosive loaded aircraft
being placed in maintenance hangers must meet the requirements of T.O. 11A-1-33, Handling
and Maintenance of Explosive-Loaded Aircraft.
     8.1. HCD 1.2.2 internal gun ammunition, 30 mm or less.
     8.2. HCD 1.3 internally installed aircraft defensive flares (external flares and rockets must
     be parked in an approved explosive loading area.
     8.3. HCD 1.4 munitions (i.e. chaff squibs, captive-carry training missiles, BDU-33s, etc.).
     Items may be carried internally or externally.
     8.4. Installed aircraft explosives necessary for safe flight operations per AFMAN 91-201,
     paragraph 12.46.
9. Quantity-Distance (Q-D) Separation: Combat aircraft carrying or to be loaded/unloaded
with munitions beyond those designated in Section Eight can be parked without regard to QD as
long as they are parked in a designated parking area and meet airfield criteria (exclude AE
installed on aircraft (e.g. egress system components, squibs, and detonators for jettisoning
external stores, engine-starter cartridges, fire extinguisher cartridges, and destructors in
electronic equipment), contained in survival and rescue kits (e.g., flares, signals, explosives
components of emergency equipment), and other such items or materials necessary for safe flight
operations. All other explosive loaded aircraft must be parked in approved sited locations and as
listed in Section 10 below, and be separated from other combat aircraft and facilities using Q-D
IAW AFMAN 91-201.
     9.1. Provide maximum separation distance between aircraft consistent with operational
     requirements. Aircraft survivability separation distance (K-30) will be afforded; if K-30
     separation cannot be achieved, separate aircraft at the greatest K-factor that can be achieved
     but never less than K-11. Intermagazine separation distance (K-11) is the minimum distance
     allowable between two combat aircraft.
     9.2. Aircraft separations less than K-30 present additional risks. The responsible
     Commanders for both the explosives-loaded aircraft and the exposed aircraft must be advised
     and accept the risk.
     9.3. A list of commonly loaded munitions and their K-11/K-30 separations distance is listed
     in attachment 1. For K-factor separations other than K-11/K-30, use formula D = K *
     NEWQD1/3, where D=distance, K= protection factor depending on degree of risk assumed
     or permitted, and NEWQD1/3= cube root of NEWQD (in pounds). Where distance is known,
     the K-factor formula is K= D / (NEWQD1/3).
EGLINAFBMAN91-202 26 JANUARY 2011                                                              5


   9.4. For non-explosive military aircraft, the minimum allowable separation factor from
   combat aircraft, explosives-loaded cargo aircraft, or munitions holding areas is K-30,
   minimum 111 ft.
   9.5. Measuring Rules.
      9.5.1. To meet K-30 separation (survivability criteria), measure from the nearest point of
      the explosives (when carried externally) to the nearest point of the exposed aircraft. For
      internally-loaded explosives, measure to and from edge of the aircraft cargo hold or bomb
      bay.
      9.5.2. To meet K-11 separation (propagation criteria); measure distances to and from the
      nearest point of the explosives, when carried externally. For internally-loaded
      explosives, measure to and from edge of the aircraft cargo hold or bomb bay.
   9.6. Hazard Classifications.
      9.6.1. Munitions receive hazard classifications in their original shipping container for
      storage and transportation. When explosives are removed from their original shipping
      container, the classification may be affected. Contact AAC/SEW for specific exceptions.
      9.6.2. Treat HCD 1.2.X as 1.1 out of the shipping container and apply 1.1 separation
      criteria. On the airfield, this rule primarily applies to weapons loaded on combat aircraft
      and munitions placed on transport trailers.
   9.7. Mixing Rules (AFMAN 91-201, Paragraph 12.7.1).
      9.7.1. As a general rule, when HCD 1.1 is mixed with HCD 1.2.X and 1.3, (except 1.4),
      sum all the explosive weights and treat as 1.1. Note: Internal HC/D 1.2 gun ammunition
      and internal HC/D 1.3 defensive flares do not need to be considered with these loads.
   9.8. HCD 1.3 Aircraft Separation. If only HCD 1.3 is loaded, apply aircraft separations as
   follows:
      9.8.1. K-11 (propagation criteria): for < 1000 lbs NEW =50 ft.
      9.8.2. K-30 (survivability criteria): for < 1000 lbs NEW =75 ft.
      9.8.3. For other separation distances above 1000 lbs, contact AAC/SEW and reference
      AFMAN 91-201, Table 12.12.
   9.9. HCD 1.4 Aircraft Separation. The minimum separation between aircraft for HCD 1.4 is
   as follows:
      9.9.1. K-11 (propagation criteria): for < 3000 lbs NEW =50 ft.
      9.9.2. K-30 (survivability criteria): for < 3000 lbs NEW =75 ft.
10. Authorized Loading/Unloading Areas:
   10.1. Hard Stand 1: Explosives are authorized for either combat aircraft or explosives
   loaded cargo aircraft. No external mounted forward firing munitions are authorized.
   Maximum munitions quantities allowed by HCD are:

    10.2. Taxiway M-West: Taxiway Mike West spot 3 is designated for Hot Cargo aircraft
    only, no external munitions or forward firing munitions are authorized. When spot 3 is
    utilized for explosive loaded aircraft, all Mike West parking spots 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 must be
    vacated and occupants of Building 915 (EOD Robotics) must be vacated. Notify Airfield
    Management and AAC Weapons Safety prior to parking any explosive loaded aircraft on
    Mike West spot 3. The net explosive weight authorizations are:

    10.3. Hot Gun Line 1 (HGL-1): The Net Explosive Weight (NEW) on Hot Gun Line 1 is
    limited to 8,000 pounds total per exemption AFMC-EGLIN-84-E3. This table lists the
    maximum explosive weight per spot without implementing any compensatory measures.
    Explosives are authorized for combat aircraft only. Forward firing munitions are not
    authorized on spot 1.
       10.3.1. A 46 TW/CC risk acceptance has been accomplished and is on file at AAC/SEW.
       Four different Compensatory Measures can be employed depending on mission
       requirements. Compensatory measures include (1) closing Taxiway-R to non-military
       aircraft, (2) evacuating Building 940 of all occupants, (3) evacuating non-combat aircraft
       adjacent to HGL-1 (i.e. tanker aircraft), and (4) allow separation of aircraft less than K-30
       but never less than K-11 separation. Attachment 1 reflects the maximum net explosive
       weight per spot when implementing one or more compensatory measures.
       10.3.2. The following chart reflects normal aircraft parking without any compensatory
       measures and assumes aircraft separation at K-30 to adjacent spots. Contact AAC/SEW
       when parking aircraft at less than K-30 and/or to implement compensatory measures for
       additional aircraft parking options if normal parking and separations cannot meet mission
       requirements.

     10.6. Live Ordnance Load Area (LOLA): The LOLA consists of two rows of aircraft for
     a total of 16 parking spots. Normal day-to-day separation of explosive loaded aircraft is K-
     30. When operations are impacted due to space limitations, separation can be reduced by
     applying the greatest K-factor available but never less than K-11. The following is the
     maximum allowable Net Explosive Weight (NEW) limits based on K-11 separation and
     cannot be exceeded regardless of aircraft separation:

         HOT GUN LINE 1 NEW LIMITATIONS IMPLEMENTING COMPENSATORY
                                  MEASURES

1. To meet net explosive weight limitations and meet mission requirements, one or more
compensatory measures may have to be implemented. To implement compensatory measures,
coordinate with AAC Weapons Safety at 882-2540 Opt.3 and Airfield Management at 882-2614.
Airfield Management will also coordinate compensatory measures through the Maintenance
Operations Center (MOC) and Transient Alert (TA).
2. To restrict Taxiway-R to non-military assets, a NOTAM must be issued through Airfield
Management.
3. Before building 940 can be vacated, approval must be obtained through 46 TW/CC and
coordinated through Indyne.
4. Explanation of terms used in this table is located at the end of this table.
5. The limitations for hazard/class divisions 1.2.2, 1.3, and 1.4 are the same for all spots and are
listed at the end of this table.
6. The limitations of this chart apply to munitions deliveries as well as munitions loading. Keep
all munitions trailers to the front and as close to the earthen-berm as possible.

EXPLANATION OF TERMS USED IN HGL-1 TABLE.
1. Routine- routine is the hazard/class division limitations without employing any of the
compensatory measures (LIMFACS) listed in this table. Note: this does not include aircraft
separation which routine separation is based on K-30 distance, see paragraph 9.
2. LIMFAC- is the risk factor that limits the net explosive weight (NEW) on a particular aircraft
parking spot and must be eliminated or mitigated before the NEW can be increased based on
mission requirements.
3. TW-R- Taxiway-R is a joint use taxiway which is shared by with civilian aircraft ad requires
more stringent quantity-distance separation compared to Military-use only assets.
4. R/W 01/19- Runway 01/19 is a joint-use runway for civilian and military aircraft.
5. B.940- building 940 is an inhabited building use by Indyne personnel which support the 46
Test Wing aircraft.
6. CapaG2T2/T3- These two spots are located on hot gun line 2 and are used to refuel aircraft
utilizing the fueling pantagraphs.
7. Exemption- This refers to an existing exemption AFSC-EGLIN-AFB-84-E3 which limits the
net explosive weight on the Hot Gun Line 1 to 8000 lbs at any given time. The exemption is to
the UHF/VHF transmitter site, Bldg.947.
8. (XX) - the numbers in parenthesis indicates separation distance in hundreds of feet.
9. 1.1 1-450 PFNS- This is a quantity-distance reduction authorized by AFMAN 91-201
provided the net explosive weight is limited from 1-450 lbs. PFNS refers to primary fragments
not stopped.
