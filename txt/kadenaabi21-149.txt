7. Alternate/Temporary Repair Area Safety Procedures.              The following procedures must be
strictly enforced to maintain a safe working environment for personnel and aircraft in the alternate fuel
systems repair areas:
     7.1. Open repair areas must be large enough to accommodate the aircraft and support equipment.
     7.2. Aircraft must be roped off 50 feet in all directions plus an additional 50 feet downwind of the
     aircraft when exhaust purging fuel tanks. Warning signs will be placed at the rope perimeter to warn
     personnel of the hazard.
     7.3. No aircraft will be allowed to operate under its own power within the jet blast safety limits
     outlined in Technical Order 1-1-3, or within 100 feet, whichever is greater. To prevent an aircraft
     from taxiing through the area, the Control Tower, Command Post, and Airfield Management will be
     notified by the MOC about the closure of the affected taxiway. This notice will also ensure the
     closure does not conflict with other activities. Airfield Management is the approving authority for
     all taxiway closures.
     7.4. Aircraft radar will not be operated within 300 feet of the open fuel tank repair area.
     7.5. All non-intrinsically safe radios will be kept at least 50 feet away from the open-repair area.
     7.6. Open repair areas will have an ample supply of grounding points for the aircraft and support
     equipment.
     7.7. All portable electrical equipment and connectors will meet the requirement of the National
     Electrical Code for class one hazardous locations.
     7.8. Extension lights used for fuel systems maintenance will be the approved explosion-proof type.
     Flashlights will be labeled or marked for use in class one, group D, and division-one hazardous
     locations.
     7.9. Repair crews will typically consist of three personnel for in-tank maintenance or as many as the
     technical data designates. For in-tank maintenance, two personnel must be 2A6X4’s (Aircraft Fuel
     Systems Technicians). The third person may be from any other Air Force Specialty Code provided
     all requirements are met IAW Technical Order (TO) 1-1-3.
     7.10. An emergency means of communication, such as a vehicle or radio, will be positioned at the
     repair site whenever open fuel tank maintenance is being performed. All radio transmission will be
     performed outside of the repair area.
8. Maintenance Approval. During fuel systems repair no other maintenance will be performed on the
aircraft without prior approval from the 18 CMS or 353 MXS Fuel Systems Repair Section Chief or
respective 2A674 Red X qualified personnel IAW 1-1-3, Para 5.2, Warning. All non-fuel systems repair
element personnel who need to enter the repair area will do so only after being cleared by a Fuel
Systems Repair Supervisor.
