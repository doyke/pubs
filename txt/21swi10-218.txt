1. General. The Peterson Command Post (CP) is responsible for overall management of the
wing alert notification system. The 21st Mission Support Group (MSG) Force Support Squadron
(FSS) is the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for Total Force Accountability (TFA) and
Air Force Personnel Accountability and Assessment System (AFPAAS). As the OPR, 21
MSG/FSS will monitor TFA efforts and provide status reports to installation leadership until
100% accountability is attained or reporting is suspended by higher headquarters. The
Installation Personnel Readiness (IPR) is responsible for overall management of the wing
Strength Accounting and Recall Reporting System (STARRS). The IPR is also responsible for
granting STARRS access to Group Control Centers (GCCs), Unit Control Centers (UCCs),
supported mission partner units, GSUs and AF Elements (AFELMs) as designated in writing by
unit commanders or directors. The 21 MSG is responsible for ensuring appropriate mission
partners are identified and incorporated in this instruction. The 21 MSG is responsible for
notifying any additional mission partners not listed in this document.
21SWI10-218 2 JUNE 2011                                                                           3


   1.1. National emergencies or other contingencies may require the 21 SW/CC to notify
   personnel or recall them to their place of duty. All 21 SW units must have recall plans in
   place and ensure all personnel are aware of their responsibilities to ensure fast and accurate
   accountability. This includes DEERS enrolled family members and family members of
   DAF/NAF employees when receiving evacuation entitlements. Notifications/recalls should
   be as covert as possible to deny potential enemies useful information and to avoid public
   speculation or alarm. This instruction also establishes the requirement for group
   commanders and their units to provide recall rosters to the Peterson CP,
   21sw.woc@peterson.af.mil to facilitate timely notifications/recalls.
   1.2. Unit commanders/agency chiefs are responsible for initiating alert notifications to
   assigned personnel, including contractors supporting their respective units.
   1.3. UCCs are responsible for consolidating and relaying strength reports to the IPR.
   1.4. The IPR is responsible for reporting personnel strength to the 21 MSG/CC.
   1.5. Operations Security (OPSEC) Policy: Follow OPSEC guidance in Joint Publication 3-
   13.3, Joint Doctrine for Operations Security, AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC) and
   AFI 10-701 AFSPC SUP 1, Operations Security (OPSEC).
2. Recall. The nature of the situation or higher headquarters’ direction determines the personnel
who will be recalled and the type of recall. It is paramount that individuals respond in an
expeditious and safe manner. Personnel must report in the appropriate duty uniform. Do NOT
delay reporting for personal grooming, meals, etc. UCCs will begin strength reporting to the IPR
no later than Recall Hour +2 hours.
   2.1. Covert Recall. Recall personnel as quickly as possible without public notice and
   minimize actions which might alarm the general public. The telephone is normally used. If
   the telephone system is not operational or an individual does not have a telephone, person-to-
   person contact is required.
   2.2. Overt Recall. Recall personnel using the fastest means available. Telephone and public
   media (radio and television) are authorized for use.
   2.3. Types of Recalls and Notification.
       2.3.1. Report For Duty Recall. This recall is used to direct personnel to report for duty
       during real-world or exercise situations.         All personnel will report to their
       assigned/appointed duty sections. During exercises, personnel in non-duty status (leave,
       temporary duty and non-duty Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs)) are not
       normally contacted. Shift workers will be recalled at the discretion of the commander.
       2.3.2. Report For Accountability Recall. Accountability is everyone’s responsibility.
       This recall is used to account for all personnel during real-world or exercise situations.
       Peterson AFB UCCs will activate. Personnel will not report to their duty sections unless
       directed otherwise. This recall requires personnel to call their unit and report their status
       and, if required, the status of their DEERS-enrolled family members. See Attachment 3
       for further information.
       2.3.3. Six Ring Telephone Standby. Personnel are immediately available to receive
       information instructions by telephone or pager within six rings. Commanders or
       designees may allow personnel to leave their home while on telephone standby; however,
 4                                                                  21SWI10-218 2 JUNE 2011


        individuals must provide a contact number and be able to respond immediately if
        necessary.
        2.3.4. Notification Advisory. This advisory is used to notify personnel of actual or
        imminent situations (e.g., severe weather, early release, delayed reporting, base closure,
        local emergency, security conditions, or other directed actions). Only personnel available
        for duty are contacted. Do not contact IMAs (unless in duty status), personnel on leave,
        temporary duty, or in quarters.
        2.3.5. Communications-Out Recall. The 21 SW/CC may designate a communications-
        out recall whenever the wing sustains an overall communications failure or if the nature
        of the threat and need for security dictate. A communications-out recall involves groups
        activating their communications-out procedures. Groups/squadrons will establish
        communications-out procedures when developing recall rosters.
3. Recall Procedures. All 21 SW organizations will designate and maintain, in writing, the
mission status of all civilian personnel (i.e., essential or non-mission essential). Only mission-
essential federal employees will report to work outside normal work schedules. Non-mission-
essential federal employees can be contacted during an alert notification, but will not report
outside of normal work schedules unless a commander or supervisor deems them essential for a
particular situation. Contractors must be identified as essential for operations through their
contract or statement of work to be recalled. Mission-essential includes the minimum number
required to keep critical base support and mission activities functioning until additional support
arrives. This includes, but is not limited to, fire fighters, security forces, command and control,
power plant operators, snow removal, medical personnel, dining facility workers, selected child
care workers, and shift workers. While in contrast, non-essential personnel are those that could
be delayed for short periods of time (hours to days) without serious mission impact.
Commanders identify mission-essential and non-mission-essential positions and ensure the
personnel are properly notified. Mission-essential positions should be documented in the
employee's AF 971, Supervisor/Employee Brief. There are occasions when management may
recall non-mission-essential employees because of a mission requirement. Circumstances can
change in a matter of minutes or hours requiring mission-essential status to change.
     3.1. Crew rest personnel. Crew rest requirements are established by AFSPCI 10-1202.
     3.2. Each unit commander will develop a recall process that ensures the most efficient
     dissemination of information and timely feedback up the chain of command.
     3.3. All 21 SW groups, squadrons, and wing staff agencies will provide the Peterson CP a
     current recall roster no later than the tenth day of each quarter (or as changes occur)
     beginning with January and continuing on the tenth day of April, July and October.
     3.4. All 21 SW assigned personnel will ensure they have adequate family care plans. The 21
     SW/CC determines if child care facilities will open to support contingencies.
     3.5. The Peterson CP will notify the wing command section, all 21 SW Group Commanders
     and the Director of Staff (DS) or their designated alternates. The Peterson CP will also
     initiate recall of all 21 OG GSUs. The Peterson CP will provide the IPR additional guidance
     for a Format 6 Total Force Accountability received by higher headquarters. If formed, the
     CAT will initiate recalls and make appropriate notifications.
21SWI10-218 2 JUNE 2011                                                                           5


   3.6. If already formed, the 21 SW CAT will initiate recall of all subordinate units.
   3.7. Upon receipt of a mass deployment tasking with a 72 hour or less Available to Load
   date, the Peterson CP will ensure the Installation Deployment Officer (IDO) and the 21
   SW/CC are notified immediately. If the IDO is in receipt of the deployment tasking, they
   will notify the 21 SW/CC and the Peterson CP. While the 21 SW/CC may direct a recall to
   support deployment activities, at a minimum, the IDO will ensure that all required
   deployment work centers are notified.
   3.8. Security Forces (SF) Personnel. SF units will compile and maintain recall information
   for SF augmentee personnel assigned to support SF operations during a crisis or exercise.
   3.9. Units supporting task forces must ensure task force personnel are included in their alert
   notification system. Examples include, but are not limited to, Personnel Support for
   Contingency Operations (PERSCO), mobility, cargo processing, transient alert, and search
   and recovery teams. Respective units will have rosters tailored to identify and notify such
   teams, as necessary.
4. Information Protection.
   4.1. Recall Rosters. The term "recall rosters" and/or "rosters" pertain to all alert notification
   types of rosters.     Units will develop and maintain recall rosters that include both
   communications-in and communications-out formats and instructions. The recall roster must
   contain the following statements:
“This roster is subject to the “Privacy Act of 1974,” 5 U.S.C. § 552a. Personal privacy
information regarding government employees and members of the Armed Forces is
protected, as implemented by AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program. Information is
being collected to allow for alert notifications procedures and is for official intra-
governmental use only.”
      4.1.1. Unlisted phone numbers must be identified with an asterisk (*) with the following
      statement on the recall roster. "Unlisted phone numbers will not be released to anyone
      outside the organization and will be used for official government business only." Do not
      release unlisted phone numbers to personnel without a need to know.
      4.1.2. Mark rosters FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY, show an "as of” date, and identify the
      organization's recall roster POC.
      4.1.3. Required Instructions. Provide all necessary recall instructions to all personnel.
      As a minimum, include the following, "Instructions for Use." Recall rosters will identify
      mission-essential personnel.
      4.1.4. Notification Processes. Provide all necessary information when the primary
      contact cannot be made; provide provisions for reporting when required actions and
      notifications are complete. Provide information of what to do when the telephone is
      inoperative or the individual is otherwise unavailable.
      4.1.5. Personnel Listings. Include military and civilian personnel. Identify IMAs, unit
      reservists and Mission-Essential Federal Employees (MEFEs). List personnel by rank,
      name, duty phone and home phone. It is recommended that addresses be included to
      facilitate "communications-out" notification procedures. Directors and key personnel
      may be identified by duty title.
 6                                                                   21SWI10-218 2 JUNE 2011


     4.2. Provide each person a copy of the roster. Personnel must ensure DEERS enrolled
     family members are aware of the roster information if evacuation is declared and evacuating
     separately.
     4.3. Dispose of obsolete rosters in such a manner as to prevent the unauthorized release of
     personal information.
5. Standard Recall Formats. The below formatted terminology will be identified on the back
of all 21 SW recall rosters. Units may add additional formats, as required. Recall Reference
Time will be the time the commander of the organization directs initiation of the recall. Recall
Reference Time is also used to determine the time required to complete recall actions.
     5.1. Format 1A. Peterson AFB Recall: “This is the Peterson Command Post with a
     Format 1A Recall. Recall Reference Hour is _____L. Recall IS/IS NOT applicable to
     721 MSG. ” GCC/UCCs will activate. Crisis Action Team WILL/WILL NOT activate.
     Instructions: Complete your pyramid alert notifications and report for duty immediately.
     Crisis Action Team (CAT) personnel will report to the primary CAT facility unless directed
     otherwise. GCCs/UCCs will activate.
     5.2. Format 1B. 21 SW Recall: “This is the Peterson Command Post with a Format 1B
     Recall. Recall Reference Hour is ______L.” GCC/UCCs will activate. Crisis Action
     Team WILL/WILL NOT activate. Instructions: Complete your pyramid alert notifications

     the primary/alternate/tertiary/virtual/off-site location. If virtual, CAT members will log into
     the 21 SW Common Operational Picture (COP) chat room using the Defense Connect Online
     (DCO) while remaining in immediate area. CAT members may also be directed to report to
     the Off-Site area.
     5.4. Format 3. 21 SW Recall for Accountability Purposes. “This is the Peterson
     Command Post with a Format 3 Accountability Recall. This recall IS/IS NOT
     applicable to 21 SW DEERS enrolled dependents. This recall IS/IS NOT applicable to
     mission partner personnel. Recall Reference Hour is ________L.”                Instructions:
     GCC/UCCs and the IPR will activate. All 21 SW personnel will immediately report status to
     their UCCs at (xxx) xxx-xxxx. UCCs will access/update STARRS accordingly. Personnel
     do not have to report for duty unless otherwise directed. GSUs will report accountability to
     their respective GCC/UCC, who in turn will update STARRS. Group Commanders should
     ensure mission partner notifications (if applicable) are accomplished IAW this instruction,
     Chapter 9.
     5.5. Format 4. Six-Ring Telephone Standby: “This is the Peterson Command Post with a
     Format 4 notification. Recall Reference Hour is ______L.” (NOTE: A reference/recall
     hour may or may not be established). Instructions: Complete your pyramid alert
     notifications and stand by on six-ring alert until further notice. You must be capable of being
     contacted by radio, telephone or pager within six rings.
21SWI10-218 2 JUNE 2011                                                                         7


   5.6. Format 5. General Notification Advisory: “This is the Peterson Command Post with
   a Format 5 notification of ________.” (NOTE: Delayed reporting, base closure, local
   emergency, or security condition requiring immediate notification of personnel.) Recall
   Reference Hour is ______L.” (NOTE: A reference hour may or may not be established.)
   Instructions: Complete your pyramid alert notifications.
   5.7. Format 6. Total Force Accountability (TFA). “This is the Peterson Command Post
   with a Format 6 Total Force Accountability. Recall Reference Hour is ________L.”
   Instructions: UCCs and IPR will activate. If in the Geographic Area Of Interest (GAOI),
   unless otherwise directed by your UCC, log on to the Air Force Personnel Accountability and
   Assessment System (AFPAAS) webpage: https://afpaas.af.mil for reporting instructions. If
   unable to do so, contact your UCC at (xxx) xxx-xxxx. If unable to contact your UCC,
   contact the AFPC Personnel Readiness Center at 1800-435-9941. All UCCs must contact the
   IPR once 100% contact/accountability is made.                    GSUs will report 100%
   contact/accountability information to their respective GCC/UCC who in turn will notify the
   IPR. The IPR will monitor TFA efforts and provide status reports to leadership until 100%
   accountability is attained or reporting is suspended by higher headquarters.
   5.7.1. Air Force Personnel Accountability and Assessment System (AFPAAS) events are
   initiated by the Joint Staff (JS) or HQ USAF (HAF) when it is determined that a disaster
   event or national emergency has the potential to create a significant loss of DoD/AF affiliated
   member lives. The JS or HAF in conjunction with the Federal Emergency Management
   Agency, when applicable, establishes the GAOI and creates an accountability event in
   AFPAAS that will require each unit accomplish a TFA. Unit commanders are required to
   make 100% contact and account for all assigned personnel and their DEERS eligible family
   members (if directed). Individuals in the GAOI are required to account using the AFPAAS
   system. If you are in the GAOI, unless otherwise directed by your UCC, log on to the
   AFPAAS webpage at https://afpaas.af.mil for reporting instructions.
6. Strength Reporting Procedures. UCCs will accomplish strength reporting using STARRS.
Units without access to STARRS will use the strength reporting worksheet located at
Attachment 2. Worksheets will be marked “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY” when filled in. For
maximum operations security of strength data, use secure communications, when available. The
21 SW GCC/UCCs contact the IPR with strength data. The IPR will provide total wing
personnel strength data to the 21 MSG/CC. The 21 MSG/CC will ensure strength data is
provided to the 21 SW/CC. Use the following definitions when providing strength report data
   6.1. Assigned Strength. This is the number of personnel actually assigned to the unit. This
   includes the number of military personnel assigned to the unit, to include personnel on
   terminal leave and personnel in PCS status that are still accounted for in your manning
   strength. The 21 FSS will maintain a contact number on personnel in PCS/Terminal Leave
   status.
   6.2. Leave. This is the number of personnel on ordinary, emergency, or convalescent leave.
   6.3. TDY. This number includes all personnel on TDY orders, attending non-local
   Professional Military Education (PME), or at conferences and classes off base.
   6.4. Hospitalized. This is the number of personnel admitted to the hospital or placed on
   quarters.
 8                                                                  21SWI10-218 2 JUNE 2011


     6.5. Other. Identify any personnel in correctional custody, confinement, security access
     revocation, or Absent Without Leave. These personnel are accounted for, but not available
     for duty.
     6.6. Available for Duty. This is the number of personnel who can respond to the situation.
     Include all personnel currently on duty and crew members in crew rest. During exercises,
     personnel undergoing promotion testing, attending local PME or performing exercise
     evaluator or controller duties are considered available for duty. Individuals attending PME
     need to be accounted for, but, at the direction of the 21 SW/CC, may not need to be removed
     from PME.
     6.7. Not Available for Duty. These individuals not contacted during the recall or not able to
     perform duties.
     6.8. UCC Members/Monitors. Report strength accountability in STARRS and update
     changes as they occur. The IPR will update assigned numbers on behalf of UCCs based on
     information provided if they do not have access to the STARRS. The unit commander will
     validate the assigned strength numbers.
     6.9. The UCCs at Peterson AFB need to contact the IPR for access to the STARRS database.
     The UCC POCs need to be identified by an appointment letter in Attachment 1 from the
     squadron commander to gain STARRS access. The UCCs are responsible for assisting their
     units outside of the Peterson AFB complex with gaining access and reporting strength
     numbers, to include update of recall strength if access is not available.
     6.10. Upon initiation of a Recall Format 1A, 1B, 3, or 6, GCC/UCCs will form to account
     for unit personnel and report strength via STARRS to 21 FSS/FSOXI (IPR). For Recall
     Format 1A, 1B, or 3 the Peterson CP will relay additional commander directed guidance
     IAW the Peterson CP checklists. During a Format 6, the Peterson CP will notify the IPR of
     any additional accountability guidance relayed by higher headquarters . The IPR will relay
     this information to the GCC/UCCs. The GCC/UCCs will accomplish the appropriate
     accountability recall with the additional guidance. During a Format 4, UCCs may form at
     commander or staff agency chief discretion to track the status of notifications, but strength
     reporting is not required.
     6.11. The 21 SW goal is to have 100 percent accountability at recall +4 hours. A TFA,
     Format 6 may have additional timing guidance.
7. UCC and STARRS Users. Group and unit commanders will appoint members, in writing
and submit to 21 FSS/FSOXI (IPR). Appointment memos will include member’s grade, name,
computer user name, organization, and duty phone using the format in Attachment 1. As a
minimum units will have one (1) primary and one (1) alternate member appointed as a STARRS
user.
     7.1. The IPR will maintain a copy of all appointment memorandums.
     7.2. Appointment memorandums must be accomplished and sent to IPR when new UCC
     STARRS members are assigned.
     7.3. UCC members must receive STARRS training within 60 days of appointment. Newly
     appointed members can either receive the training within their unit from assigned trained
     STARRS monitors or by attending a STARRS training session conducted by the 21
21SWI10-218 2 JUNE 2011                                                                           9


   FSS/FSOXI. At least one (1) UCC member should receive STARRS training from the 21
   FSS/FSOXI.
   7.4. Recall of personnel on leave, pass, or TDY in the local area. Recall messages are not
   prepared for members on leave, pass, or TDY in the local area. They will be contacted by
   telephone or by runner during actual recall alerts.
8. Release from Recall.
   8.1. The 21 SW/CC will direct release from any recall. Normally the release statement will
   be transmitted by the Peterson CP/CAT unless the 21 SW/CC directs otherwise.
   8.2. Release is accomplished by using the organization’s recall rosters.
9. Training. Unit commanders/agency chiefs must be familiar with wing operational plans
and/or situations that require alert notifications. Commanders must train personnel on alert
notification procedures. Units are authorized and encouraged to test procedures at the discretion
of their unit commander. Unit commanders are advised to coordinate tests with 21 SW/XPP to
deconflict exercise and drill schedules.
10. Notifications. The 21 SW/CC is responsible for the safety, security, and well-being of all
21 SW personnel and mission partner units that reside on or offbase. The 21 SW/CC will utilize
the Peterson CP and assigned units for mass notifications.
   10.1. The key to protecting people and resources at Peterson AFB is timely notification of
   emergency
   situations, such as Force Protection Condition (FPCON), and Information Operations
   Condition
   (INFOCON) changes, major accidents or incidents, and imminent life-threatening weather
   conditions.
   Table in 1.1. below outlines the severe weather conditions requiring mission partner and
   subordinate unit notifications.

Table 1.1. SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS

 Warning                Associated Weather                           Desired Notification Lead Time

 Tornado Warning        Tornado                                               10 minutes
 Hail Warning           Hail greater than or equal to 3/4 inch                60 minutes
 High Wind Warning      Surface winds greater than or equal to 50 knots       60 minutes
 Lightning Warning      Observed lightning within 5 miles                     As Observed



   10.2. To ensure all on/off-base units are quickly notified of these situations, the Peterson CP
   will
initiate notifications to the group commanders and agencies listed below. These agencies have
the additional responsibility of notifying mission partner and subordinate units. All personnel
are responsible for ensuring their personnel and dependents are aware of these situations and are
also responsible for training these personnel on individual and unit protective actions in response
 10                                                                 21SWI10-218 2 JUNE 2011


to emergencies. If directed to evacuate, units must use the information directed in AFI 10-218.
The Peterson CP notifies the agencies as directed in Attachment 4.
   10.3. The agencies in Attachment 4 are responsible for notifying units in their appropriate
   chain, along with affected subordinate units. They will maintain internal procedures
   (including periods of communications outages) for timely 24-hour notifications, if required.
   Units must ensure the Peterson CP has current telephone numbers of offices or individuals
   that will be notified of emergency conditions, including cellular and home phone numbers, as
   appropriate.
       10.3.1. Each group has the responsibility to notify units and mission partners as
       identified in Attachment 4. Groups are responsible to notify subordinate units added after
       publication of this document. The 21 MSG/CC is responsible to ensure notifications are
       accomplished to mission partner units that are added after publication of this document.
       10.3.2. FPCON Notifications. The 21 SW/CC will direct the 21 SW to implement the
       appropriate FPCON through the Peterson CP and/or the CAT, if formed. Unit/agency
       POCs/GCCs/UCCs will collect and consolidate attainment data for their respective units
       and report attainment to the Peterson CP and the CAT, if formed.
       10.3.3. INFOCON Notifications. The 21 SW/CC will direct the Wing Computer
       Network Defense (WCND) and Peterson CP to implement the appropriate INFOCON.
       The WCND will notify unit Client System Administrators (CSAs) to initiate INFOCON
       changes, who will report attainment back to the WCND. The WCND reports wing
       attainment to the Peterson CP and the CAT, if formed.
       10.3.4. Incident Notifications. All individuals and organizations will notify the Peterson
       CP immediately of any incident that has the potential to generate Wing, NAF, MAJCOM,
       HQ AF leadership interest and/or local or national media interest. These include mission
       degradation or loss due to hostile acts, mishaps, accidents, or natural disasters and events
       involving personnel death, serious injury or illness, assault, or hate crimes. A complete
       list of reportable items can be found in AFI 10-206, AFSPC Supplement, Operational
       Reporting, Table 3.4 and Attachment 3.
11. Disaster Notifications and Use of the Secondary Crash Network.
   11.1. Secondary Crash Net (SCN) is a direct-line telephone notification system used for base
   emergencies. SCN agencies are limited to agencies requiring emergency action/response to
   aircraft incidents/mishaps. Only use the SCN to relay information critical to aircraft and
   airfield operations (e.g., hazardous weather warnings, in-flight emergencies, ground
   emergencies, FPCON level changes, Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
   activations/recalls, bomb threats or terrorist activities).
   11.2. AFI 13-213, Airfield Management, governs the structure and use for the SCN. The 21
   OSS/OSA, Airfield Operations Flight, is the OPR for the SCN. During airfield operating
   hours, Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS) activates the SCN for those situations
   initiated by the Primary Crash Network.
   11.3. Personnel on duty in each agency equipped with a SCN will immediately answer the
   SCN. Agencies will remain on the line until released by the AMOPS. After the second
   transmission of the message, the AMOPS will release those stations in receipt of a complete
21SWI10-218 2 JUNE 2011                                                                    11


   message. Stations having questions will remain on the line and ask questions after all
   agencies have been polled.
      11.3.1. Upon receipt of an SCN notification, agencies will accomplish required actions,
      as directed.
   11.4. Disaster Alert. The AMOPS will activate the SCN to alert disaster response forces of
   disasters or emergencies that require response per AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency
   Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. Disaster alerts may require
   immediate recall and activation of base disaster response forces. See Attachment 3 for
   guidance regarding personnel accountability following natural disasters or national
   emergencies.
   11.5. Alert Sirens. The 21 SW/CC is responsible for the safety and protection of all
   personnel on Peterson AFB. It is incumbent for all personnel residing on or working on
   Peterson AFB to understand the Giant Voice alerting messages/signals and LOCKDOWN
   procedures. Sponsors/QAEs must inform all personnel to include dependents/contractors of
   these messages/signals. Use          AFVA 10-2510, USAF Emergency Notification Signals,
   and AFVA 10-2511, USAF Standardized Attack Warning Signals, as a reference." The
   Peterson CP can use any method to alert the base populace to include desktop alerts, email
   distribution and any other potential means.
      11.5.1. The Peterson CP tests the Giant Voice every Friday at 1200L. During these tests,
      the Peterson CP coordinates with the Emergency Communications Center (ECC) and
      facilities close to the sirens in advance so patrols and personnel in the facilities can
      monitor selected sirens and report results to the Peterson CP.

                                          Attachment 3
      PERSONNEL ACCOUNTABILITY FOLLOWING NATURAL DISASTERS OR
                      NATIONAL EMERGENCIES

A3.1. IAW AFI 10-218, PERSONNEL ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONJUNCTION WITH
NATURAL DISASTERS OR NATIONAL EMERGENCIES, and this instruction, HHQ or 21
SW/CC may initiate an alert notification or recall during and/or following a natural disaster or
national emergency as deemed necessary to account for all active duty, civilians, non-
appropriated fund employees, and dependents. This is a modified recall procedure bringing
those deemed necessary to accomplish a function into their duty sections, with contact of the
remainder for accountability purposes (Recall Format 3). The 21 SW/Peterson CP is responsible
for overall management of the wing alert notification system. The IPR is responsible for overall
management of the wing personnel strength reporting system, the Total Force Accountability,
and providing guidance in accountability procedures. Unit commanders are responsible for the
management of their accountability process.
A3.2. Military and civilian members contacted may be asked about the status of their DEERS-
enrolled dependents. Accountability for members shall be reported by UCCs IAW existing alert
notification procedures, with the addition of reporting numbers of missing active duty
dependents. In the event the sponsor is away from home station, UCCs will contact the
sponsor’s dependents to ascertain their status and report it accordingly if a dependent is missing.
A3.3. All 21 SW organizations will gather and maintain home addresses and phone numbers on
all DoD civilians and NAF employees assigned to their units. This information will be
safeguarded for official use only and maintained by only those with a need to have the
information, such as section chiefs, UCCs, unit Commanders, etc. When directed, UCCs will
use this information to contact their civilians and report accountability to the IPR using the
reporting tool described in this document. The IPR will provide reporting procedures and HHQ
templates that need to be completed by the UCCs and returned to the IPR at specific reporting
times until the unit is 100% complete. UCCs need to be aware that reporting areas may
grow/shrink based on the event(s).
A3.4. Federal employees may be contacted during an alert notification, but will not report
outside of normal work schedules unless a commander or supervisor deems them essential for
providing a particular response capability. Contractors must be identified as mission-essential
for operations through their contract or statement of work or objectives in order to be recalled.
A3.5. When unable to make contact with individuals, pass the name(s) of those individuals not
contacted to the next person in the chain. Identify personnel not contacted to the
commander/UCC initiating the recall.
A3.6. Supervisors are responsible for knowing TDY and leave locations of their subordinates
and having valid contact information Commanders will ensure unit accountability statistics are
up-channeled to the IPR. The IPR will provide UCCs with the required reporting templates for
accountabilities.
A3.7. If already formed, the CAT will initiate recall of all subordinate units and staffs. Recall
status of 21 SW GSUs is the responsibility of the CAT.
