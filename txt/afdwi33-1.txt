1. Staff Meetings and Speaking Invitations: AFDW meetings and program responsibility
include, AFDW/CC Meeting Guidance, Headquarters, Air Force District of Washington (HQ
AFDW) Staff Meeting Guidance and AFDW Program Responsibility listed by A Staff, Special
Staff and HQs. Each responsibility is to be met with timeliness and accuracy.
     1.1. AFDW/CC Meetings: Requests to meet with the AFDW/CC must come from a
     Commander, Director, or Deputy. To make a request, send the following information to the
     AFDW/CC Exec org box; purpose (include whether the brief is decisional or informational),
     classification, date/time, briefer(s) and AFDW attendees, list of attendees not in AFDW and a
     point of contact (POC).
        1.1.1. Read-ahead's are required for meetings or briefings with the AFDW/CC. Send all
        read-ahead’s to the AFDW/CC Workflow Inbox and copy the AFDW/CCA. Read-aheads
        are due at 1500 hours the day prior to the meeting or briefing.
     1.2. AFDW/CC speaking invitation: Requests for AFDW/CC to speak or brief at an event
     will be submitted before the event. All requests must be submitted not later than (NLT) five
     work days prior to the event. To make a request, complete the Speaking Questionnaire at
     (Attachment 2) and send to AFDW/CC Workflow and AFDW/CCX Workflow.
     1.3. HQ AFDW/CC Staff Meeting: The AFDW/CC staff meeting is scheduled every
     Monday at 1000. When a Federal holiday falls on a Monday, the staff meeting will occur on

     proceeding Friday in order to verify security clearance information. Slides should be e-
     mailed to AFDW/CC Workflow. Slides are due on Friday for Monday and Tuesday staff
     meetings; if Friday is a holiday, the slides are due on Thursday. Requests to provide a special
AFDWI33-1 22 JUNE 2011                                                                          3


   brief must come from the Commander, Director or Deputy and should be coordinated with
   AFDW/CCX before the staff meeting. Slides for the brief are due to the AFDW/CCK
   Workflow the preceding Friday. The briefing should be no more than 10 minutes in length.
   Classified briefings must be coordinated with AFDW/CCK before Friday.
2. Staff Work and Administrative: Prepare all Air Force (AF) correspondence using plain
language. Plain language saves the AF time, effort and money. Plain language means using
logical organization and common, everyday words, except for necessary technical terms. Prepare
correspondence using active voice and short sentences. Refer to AFH 33-337, The Tongue and
Quill and (Attachment 3)
   2.1. Organize material for the reader. Identify the audience for the document; write to get
   attention and anticipate questions. Always start by putting the main message up front. Present
   information in the succeeding paragraphs in a logical order.
   2.2. Avoid words and/or phrases the reader might not understand and define each
   abbreviation or acronym the first time it is used. Avoid ambiguous phrasing, confusing legal
   terms and technical jargon.
   2.3. Use "you" and other pronouns to speak directly to readers (active voice). Do not refer to
   people as if they were inanimate objects. "You" reinforces the message intended for your
   reader. To communicate effectively, write sentences in the active voice. Active voice is the
   best way to identify who is responsible for what action.
   2.4. Short sentences deliver a clear message and sentences should average 15 to 20 words.
   Complex sentences confuse the reader by losing the main point Resist the temptation to put
   everything in just one sentence. Break up your idea into its logical parts.
   2.5. Coordinate with offices affected by the proposed action during the draft stage to ensure
   minimal revisions. Coordinate with each office mat has a functional interest Schedule enough
   time to finish review and coordination.
   2.6. Coordinate using the Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) provided on Virtual National Capital
   Region (NCR), https://amcr.af.mil/org/AFDW CC/default.aspx. (Attachments 4,5 and 6)
3. Review: Staff work resulting in a set of electronic files (packages) requiring Commander
(CC), or Vice Commander (CV) review and signature must be delivered in a paper copy to
AFDW/CCK. Once reviewed and signed, a PDF of the signed documents) will be added to the
electronic package to comply with HAF/ES guidance IAW HOI 33-3.
   3.1. The Action Officer (AO) is responsible for the package until the task is complete; the
   package is signed and delivered to the final recipient.
       3.1.1. The suspense date is the date the final action must be completed. It is not the date
       the package leaves the AO's desk.
       3.1.2. Organizations creating pre-routed tasks that will generate a package seeking
       command level signature should check with Command Executive Officer (CCE) before
       setting the task suspense date. The front office can require up to five days for package
       review and signature.
       3.1.3. Tasks should be limited to one topic with a single suspense. Related topics with an
       earlier or later suspense require separate tasks.
 4                                                                  AFDWI33-1 22 JUNE 2011


     3.2. The front cover SSS must be signed by the commander, vice commander, director or
     deputy. Check the document for format, typos, spelling, grammar and punctuation. Refer to
     the Virtual NCR page https://afdw.afncr.af.mil/org/AFDW_CC/default.aspx for proper SSS,
     format and procedures.
     3.3. All files need to have clear and descriptive filenames: Questions on the status of a
     package should be directed to CCK.
        3.3.1. Ensure all attachments correspond to those listed on the printed electronic Stall
        Summary Sheet (e-SSS), as needed. Check format and proofread for typos, spelling,
        grammar and punctuation within all documents. This is critical for anything to be signed.
        Double check all references to make sure they are correct.
        3.3.2. Prepare letters or memorandums for signature and provide appropriate authority to
        sign and perform the required action. Check format and proofread for typos, spelling,
        grammar and punctuation.
            3.3.2.1. For appointments, delegations, and waivers, include a copy of the Air Force
            Instruction (AFI) text which authorized the AFDW/CC to take the requested action.
            Highlight the specific text on the copied page which authorizes the requested action.
4. Task Management Tool (TMT): TMT is the primary tasking method for all AFDW staff
work. This policy does not yet apply to Officer Performance Reports, (OPRs) or Enlisted
Performance Reports (EPRs). TMT will be used for all HQ AFDW tasks whether they are
internal or external, and can be used for notification and information-sharing purposes.
     4.1. Internal tasks can be initiated by the CC, CV, CCC, DS, DSD or Directors. Internal
     staffing is appropriate for information, review or coordination of documents and similar
     functions Director-to-Director tasks should be done in TMT. The final package must show
     the appropriate Wing level and HQ AFDW staff coordination on the SSS for the package to
     be forwarded to the AFDW/CCK. Never task below the command or directorate level. See
     section 4.2.
        4.1.1. The task template (titled Word Tasker Template) can be found on the Virtual NCR
        page, https://afdw.afncr.af.mil/org/AFDW_CC/default.aspx Template Tab. The
        template includes detailed instruction.
        4.1.2. A properly formatted Word task document for each task will be uploaded into the
        Original Documents folder of TMT. Reference the Virtual NCR page
        https://afdw.afncr.af.mil/org/AFDW_CC/default.aspx a printed example is provided.
        (Attachment 7)
        4.1.3. The tasker must include all organizations tasked. Director initiated tasks are
        tracked by the tasking directorate. All others are tracked by the DS or DSD. The Office of
        Primary Responsibility (OPR) will usually be the two-letter organization, wing (WG), or
        group requesting distribution. The Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR) will be the
        two-letter organization, wing, or group tasked.
     4.2. External tasks are directed to the wings and groups by the DS or DSD. Directorates will
     not task the Wings. When the entire A-Staff or Special Staff organizations are tasked, these
     terms should be used. Do not list them individually.
AFDWI33-1 22 JUNE 2011                                                                          5


      4.2.1. Internal HQ AFDW communication and cooperation at the appropriate level is
      highly encouraged, but directors or commanders are solely responsible for tasking their
      organizations and staff. Three and four letter organizations should not be designated as
      OPRs or OCRs, except for CCE, CCX and CCK. Individuals should never be tasked in
      TMT.
      4.2.2. AFDW organizations will forward pre-routed external tasks to the AFDW/DS
      Workflow box in TMT for review and distribution to the 11 WG, 79 MDW, 844 CG, and
      directorates as appropriate.
   4.3. The file name for the Word task must begin with the word "TASKER" to ensure easy
   identification by recipients. There can be many files in the Original Documents folder, so
   clear and descriptive filenames are important.
   4.4. At a minimum the Task Instructions section from the Word task should be copied into
   the General Tab portion of the pre-routed task. Offices receiving tasks from Higher
   Headquarters (HHQ) will prepare a pre-routed task and forward to AFDW/DS Workflow in
   TMT. The General Tab shall contain specific guidance to the OCRs that is clear who should
   receive the information, for what purpose, what action will complete the notification to
   complete the process, and for TMT outages. (Attachments 7 and 8)
      4.4.1. The data on the Word task in the General Tab window and in the Task Status
      section must be consistent with each other.
   4.5. Tasks should allow a minimum of five business days for response. Coordinate with
   AFDW/DS if shorter periods are required. The OPR or Originating Office is responsible for
   monitoring the suspense, completing tasks; and requesting extensions. NOTE: HAF/ES will
   not accept extension requests from Directors or Action Officers. Contact AFDW/DS if a
   HAF/ES extension is needed.
      4.5.1. The rational for a shorter suspense must be included as the first line in the General
      Tab of the pre-routed task and in the Suspense line of the accompanying Word task. The
      suspense date must match the date in the task Status line.
      4.5.2. All OCRs normally have the same suspense. If an OCR requires a unique suspense
      explain the requirement in the OCR instruction in TMT. TMT has programming
      limitations that preclude an OCR's suspense later than the OPR suspense.
   4.6. Nominations and Awards. TMT will be used to request nominations and awards.
   Specific nomination and/or selection information must be included in the Word task.
   (Attachment 9) 4.6.1. This guidance applies to requests for nominations for key assignments,
   AF, functional, and AFDW awards.
      4.6.1. Coordinate suspense for nominations requiring AFDW/CC action with
      AFDW/CCE. Packages should be delivered to AFDW/CCK two weeks before the
      suspense unless the HHQ suspense does not permit.
      4.6.2. Directorates processing functional awards should coordinate with AFDW/A1 for
      specific guidance.
5. Congressional Relations Program: In accordance with AFI 91-401, Air Force Relations
with Congress, AFDW Wing Commands will visit respective Congressional delegations
annually through the Capitol Hill Visit Program coordinated by SAF/LLZ. AFDW/CCX is the
 6                                                                   AFDWI33-1 22 JUNE 2011


OPR for this program. The purpose of this program is to build a long-term, face-to-face
relationship with Congressional Members and staffs; and facilitate the delivery of a consistent
Air Force message to Capitol Hill.
       5.1.1. Visits are meant to be courtesy calls during which Members can meet with Wing
       Commanders and discuss AF issues important to them and their constituents.
       Commanders are encouraged to take their Command Chief and/or other representatives
       of the base. Frequent discussion topics for visits include Global War On Terrorism
       (GWOT), Personnel, Total Force Integration, Recapitalization, Base Realignment and
       Closure (BRAC), Military Construction and Housing. Further guidance about appropriate
       and inappropriate topics of discussion is available from SAF/LLZ. Short handouts to
       leave with the Member's office are encouraged and should be coordinated with the
       AFDW/CCX and AFDW/PA offices prior to the visit.
       5.1.2. After the Wing Commander returns from the Congressional visit, he or she will
       complete the Post Congressional Visit Questionnaire (Attachment 10). The purpose of
       this questionnaire is to capture the highlights of the visit, including contact information of
       the Member or Staffer, key issues discussed, results of the meeting and any actions
       required as a result of the meeting.
       5.1.3. After a Congressional representative visits an AFDW organization, the Wing or
       Group Commander will complete Congressional Visit to Installation Questionnaire
       (Attachment 10). The purpose of this questionnaire is to capture the highlights of the
       visit, including contact information of the Member or Staffer, key issues discussed,
       results of the meeting, and any actions required as a result of the meeting. Return the
       questionnaire to the CAG office, (AFDW/CCX).

                                     AFDW GRAMMAR GUIDE

The following rules apply to all correspondence for the AFDW/CC including OPRs, EPRs and PRFs. This
is not intended to be a comprehensive guide; it simply addresses the most common mistakes. Please refer
to AFH 33-337, The Tongue and Quill for additional guidance.
1. Space twice after a period
2. Space once after a comma
3. Space once after a semi-colon
4. Do not space before or after a hyphen, except in the case of expressions such as "short- or long-term"
5. Space twice after a colon
6. Space once before open parenthesis, but do not space after it
7. Space once after a closed parenthesis, but do not space before it
8. Space twice after punctuation at the end of a sentence (includes period, question mark and exclamation
point)
        NOTE: The Tongue and Quill allows an organization to determine spacing after an exclamation
        point AFDW will use two spaces
9. When capitalized, the word "Capitol" refers to the name of a building or neighborhood, e.g., "the
Capitol", "Capitol Hill", "Capitol Heights." When not referring to a place or name do not capitalize the word,
e.g. the capitol building, or the state capitol. The word "federal" is not capitalized unless it is the name of
an agency, e.g. "Federal Bureau of Investigation"
10. Space twice after MEMORANDUM FOR. Example:
MEMORANDUM FOR AFDW/DS
 12                                                                          AFDWI33-1 22 JUNE 2011

                                           STAFF PACKAGES

                 (Commander, Vice Commander, Command Chief and Director of Staff)

All packages sent to the command section will include a SSS with standard AFDW routing and comments.
The command section will determine the actual routing of the package based on the content and availability
of personnel. Deliver star! packages to AFDW/CCK for log-in and distribution. NOTE: The SSS should
stand on its own and provide a concise and comprehensive explanation of the package. All tabs should
be addressed in the text.

In general SSSs will contain the following blocks:

PURPOSE

-Use this block to briefly summarize the reason for the SSS.

DISCUSSION

- Use this block to summarize pertinent information regarding the package. If the package is for approval of
an action, use this section to describe why the action should be approved by the recipient and not someone
else. For instance, "In accordance with AFIXX-XXX, approval authority for this issue is the MAJCOM
Commander." If the commander is asked to waive, approve, appoint or take action. Provide the AFI
documentation as a tab.

CONCURRING ORGANIZATIONS

- Use this block to list which organizations have coordinated on and concurred with the package and any key
points they provided.

NON-CONCURRING ORGANIZATIONS

- Use this block to list any organizations that coordinated, but non-concurred with the package.
Documentation of the non-concur must be included in the package. Include a concise statement of their
position.

RECOMMENDATION

- Use this block to advise the recipient on a course of action. Be specific. For instance, do not simply write,
"Recommend the commander approve this initiative." Instead write, "Recommend the commander approve
this initiative by signing the attached letter at Tab 1."

- Signature Block

- All SSSs must be signed by a Commander, Vice Commander, Command Chief and Director of Staff
requesting the action.
AFDWI33-1 22 JUNE 2011                                                                                      13



PACKAGE CONTENT

- The content of each package will vary greatly based on the issue. The following are basic guidelines
that apply to all packages.

- Include an electronic copy of any document that is to be signed or approved. This allows the command
section to add the date and make changes based on the signer's style. The electronic copy can be posted in
TMT Public Work Space, or emailed (if coordinated with CCK).

- Include any information the recipient may need to make a decision. Large documents may be saved to a
disk. Short documents should be in hard copy.

LETTERS FOR SIGNATURE

- Letters requiring signature must be on AFDW letterhead in Times New Roman 12 point Format
must comply with AFH 33-327, The Tongue and Quill.

- Use HAF OI 33-3 as a guide for preparing correspondence for HAF senior leadership signature. To locate
HAF OI 33-3 follow the "AFDW Policy and Guidance" link on the left side of the AFDW/CC page:
https://afdw.afncr.af.mil/org/AFDW_CC/default.aspx. HAF OI 33-3 is available digitally on the Air
Force Portal at https://www.mv.af.mil/:: Bases-Orgs-Functional Areas:: My Org:: HAF:: Popular
Links:: HOIs

- If the letter appoints a point of contact (POC) for an issue, the POC must be of an appropriate rank based on
the intended recipient of the letter. For instance, if the letter is from the AFDW/CC to the VCSAF, the POC
will be the AFDW/CC not SSgt Smith. Another option is to write, “Please contact me if you have questions or
your staff may contact my Director of XXX at….”.

Create a Word tasker for every TMT task - Include "TASKER" in its file name - Upload into
Original Documents
* TMT limitations require a HHQ Suspense for every tasker
* * TMT limitations allow for a single OPR

Word Tasker = the Originating Office is the CC. The OPR is A12 & the OCRs are the
directorates
In TMT the OPR is A12 and OCRs are the staff directorates

Example 2: A12 initiates a request through the DS for the staff to coordinate an issue
Word Tasker = The Originating Office is DS. The OPR is A12 and OCRs are the directorates

If you have questions contact AFDW/DS or AFDW/DSD

GENERAL GUIDANCE

These procedures will be used during TMT outages when directed by AFDW/DS. These procedures are
designed to mirror the tasking process in TMT and to facilitate transfer of taskers into TMT when services

in the subject e.g. 'Tasker - Call for Quarterly Account Review".

2. The non-TMT pre-routed tasker, e-mail text should briefly state the information that would have been
provided in TMT. See attachment 4.

3. The first attachment to the pre-routed tasker should be the standard "Word Tasker" with 'TASKER"
as the first word in the file name.

4. All required files and background information should be attached to the pre-routed tasker with clearly
identifiable file names.


DIRECTORATE SPECIFICS

This guidance applies to requests for nominations for AF, functional, and AFDW awards and
key assignment opportunities. In addition to the basics include: Name of the award - Due
Date - Tasking Information.

The purpose of providing this information is to provide AFDW/CC the earliest possible notification
of his responsibilities in the nomination/selection process. It is his desire to announce the selectees
and publicly recognize them.
Nominations requiring AFDW/CC review/signature should be coordinated with the CCE to ensure
AFDW/CC availability. Two weeks is desired unless the HHQ suspense does not permit.

Special care should be taken to ensure elements and individuals assigned worldwide are afforded the
opportunity to compete, as appropriate.

The outside organizations that require notification/tasking from AFDW will vary by award. AOs
are responsible for ensuring all the applicable organizations are contacted.

AFDW/A1 has the most experience notifying these individuals, and should be consulted by the
tasker OPR.

This information should be placed in the BACKGROUND section in the Word tasker and also in
the Details tab in TMT. Recognizing that the nomination/selection process varies, request directors
include the appropriate information.
 Eligibility                                Qualifications for nomination eligibility
