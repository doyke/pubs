This instruction implements Air Force Instruction 36-102, Basic Authority and Responsibility for
Civilian Personnel Management and Administration. This instruction establishes policy,
responsibilities, and procedures to implement the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)
Division Chief, Branch Chief, Section Chief, non-bargaining Chief Engineer, Department
Chairs, and non-bargaining Technical Advisor position assignment procedures. This instruction
applies to all AFRL organizations. This publication may be supplemented at any level, but all
direct supplements must be routed to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) of this
publication for coordination prior to certification and approval. Refer recommended changes
and questions about this publication to the OPR, using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication; route AF Form 847 through the appropriate functional chain of
command. Requests for waivers must be processed through command channels to the publication
OPR for consideration. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained IAW Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS)
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been updated to remove any references to military personnel. Military chief
positions are no longer required to be advertised or competed. The name of this instruction was
changed to clarify the true meaning for this instruction, which is to cover all AFRL civilian
leadership positions. This change clarifies temporary actions and Headquarters (HQ)
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) announcement policies with template added as attachment.

All Lab Demo leadership positions for promotions must be advertised through civilian personnel
office (CPO) not just AFRL wide.
1. Policy. This policy includes all civilian division chief, branch chief, section chief, non-
bargaining chief engineer, department chairs, and non-bargaining technical advisor vacancies
and will ensure all interested AFRL employees are given the opportunity to apply for such
positions. This policy does not negate the current Air Force Materiel Command Commander
(AFMC/CC) GS-15/DR-IV Assignment and Announcement Policies and Procedures.
Appropriate paperwork must be submitted IAW AFRL policy. All applicable civilian personnel
policies, instructions, and bargaining agreements will apply.
     1.1. All Lab Demo Civilian Division, Branch, Section Chief, and Department Chair
     vacancies filled via reassignment will be advertised to all Lab Demo civilians AFRL wide as
     applicable by broadband level/at the geographic location where the vacancy exists (due to
     Permanent Change of Station [PCS] funding restrictions).
     1.2. All Lab Demo Civilian Division, Branch, Section Chief and Department Chair
     vacancies filled via promotion will be advertised through the appropriate CPO to at least the
     minimum area of consideration required by the CPO.
     1.3. All civilian division, technology directorate (TD)/711th Human Performance Wing (711
     HPW) level non-bargaining technical advisor positions must be announced TD/711 HPW, at
     a minimum, to all civilians GS-15/DR-IV and below as applicable by broadband level/GS or
     equivalent grade level at the geographic location where the vacancy exists (due to PCS
     funding restrictions).
     1.4. All TD/711 HPW level non-bargaining chief engineer positions must be announced Air
     Force (AF) wide. By announcing these positions external to AFRL, we will ensure that the
     best possible candidates with the best possible balance of Science and Technology/Product
     Center/Logistics Center experience are considered, therefore, providing the broadest possible
     understanding of customer technology transition requirements.
2. Exceptions. The following exceptions to this policy have been approved by the corporate
board and include:
     2.1. Placement of an individual returning from a career-broadening assignment with a
     documented MOA to a similar position (e.g., individual was a branch chief prior to career-
     broadening assignment and is returning to a branch chief position).
     2.2. Civilian leadership positions covered under the Leadership Development Initiative or
     other similar programs where a candidate list will be provided by a higher source; i.e., HQ
     AFMC, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition (SAF/AQ), Air
     Force Personnel Center (AFPC).
     2.3. Reassignment of an existing AFRL Division/Branch/Section Chief to a respective
     vacant position; resulting vacancy (including daisy chain vacancies) must be announced
     according to the policy.
     2.4. AFRL Executive Director (AFRL/CA) waiver approval processed through AFRL
     Directorate of Personnel (AFRL/DP).
     2.5. Realignments when entire office is realigned from one organization to another.
AFRLI36-105 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                  3


   2.6. Job swaps within or across TD/711 HPW of existing leadership positions for
   developmental purposes or mission requirements not resulting in a vacancy.
   2.7. Lateral reassignment of an existing Wright-Site contracting individual to an AFRL
   vacancy in accordance with the MOA Wright-Patterson AFB Contracting Enterprise
   Initiative (CEI).
   2.8. This instruction does not cover Senior Executive Service or Scientific and Professional
   civilian positions.
3. Temporary Actions. Temporary actions up to 120 days do not need to be announced.
Actions extended beyond the 120 days must be announced IAW paragraphs 1.1., 1.2., and 1.3.
4. PCS Costs. For some civilian leadership selections, payment of PCS costs is at the discretion
of the gaining organization if the selected employee is from a different duty location than the
duty location of the announced position. When a position is centrally managed, (covered by
career programs), PCS costs will normally be paid by the Air Force Career Program.
5. Lab Demo Reassignment Announcement Process. Each Senior Personnel Advisor’s
(SPA’s) office will post vacancy announcement(s) via established automated processes.
Announcements must be open for a minimum of five working days with the preference being ten

   [APDP] requirements).
   5.3. Requirement for a Chronological Resume (three page limit) from applicant.
   5.4. Point of contact information.
6. Lab Demo Promotion Announcement Process. Positions will be announced by the
appropriate CPO in accordance with established processes.
7. Interview Questions. Use the local civilian personnel guide as a reference in preparing your
questions.   Interview questions need approval by AFRL/DP or the servicing CPO.
Documentation of the selection process should be retained for at least two years.
8. Interview Panel Requirements. The requirements are as follows and are mandatory for
every AFRL civilian leadership fill action. The requirements include a panel for all selections
with a minimum of three people (rank/grade; one grade above position, only equal to position
when necessary) consisting of:
   8.1. One minority or female representative,
   8.2. One member from outside of the affected division, and
   8.3. One member from outside the affected directorate/wing, where possible.
   8.4. TD/711 HPW level chief engineer panels must include the AFRL Chief Engineer.
   8.5. Exception: An interview panel is not mandatory when only one candidate applies.
9. Selection Guidelines. The following selection guidelines are factors that should be
considered in the selection decision. DR-IV/GS-15 selectees must follow established AFMC
assignment and announcement policies and procedures.
