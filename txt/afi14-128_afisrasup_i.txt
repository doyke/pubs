OVERVIEW

In 1948, the United States Air Force Security Service (USAFSS) was created as a single-service
organization for USAF cryptologic capabilities. Along with sister service counterparts, this
single organization was referred to as a Service Cryptologic Element (SCE) in National Security
Agency and Department of Defense guidance and policy, and assigned numerous roles and
responsibilities in support of a unified US cryptologic enterprise. Through the years, successor
AF organizations also assumed the SCE role: Electronic Security Command, AF Intelligence
Command, and Air Intelligence Agency. In 2001, changes in AF organization created the
situation where some AF cryptologic capabilities, manpower and resources were no longer
assigned directly to the AF SCE. In 2007, Director NSA policy changed SCE to Service
Cryptologic Component (SCC); simultaneously the Air Force transformed Air Intelligence
Agency to AF Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency (AF ISR Agency) through
PAD 07-09. PAD 07-09 and later AF Mission Directive 15, Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance,
and Reconnaissance Agency (AF ISR Agency) re-designated AF ISR Agency as the AF SCC. All
of these changes, along with the existence of some cryptologic capabilities not assigned to the
AF SCC, highlighted the urgent requirement for an AF Instruction to specify the roles and
responsibilities of the AF SCC and AF organizations that would support Department of Defense
requirements for the Service Cryptologic Component.

1. AF SCC Role. AF SCC is the principal advisor to the AF/A2 staff for all programming,
budgeting, training, personnel, policy, doctrine, governance, and foreign relationships for USAF
cryptologic activities. The AF SCC ensures compliance by all USAF cryptologic activities with
the cryptologic policies, tasking, and technical guidance provided by DoD and the Director,
National Security Agency/Chief, Central Security Service (DIRNSA/CHCSS).
2. AF SCC Responsibilities: The AF SCC is the service lead for all USAF cryptologic
activities and has management oversight of those elements of the USAF performing cryptologic
functions. This applies to the cryptologic staff of the AF ISR Agency, its subordinate elements,
and cryptologic elements assigned to other USAF organizations. The AF ISR Agency
Commander is the AF SCC/CC and principal USAF advisor to DIRNSA/CHCSS for USAF
cryptologic matters. The AF SCC maintains an appropriate staff to organize train and equip all
cryptologic resources and activities in the USAF. This staff also provides the management
oversight for all USAF cryptologic activities regardless of program to ensure these activities are
compliant with National and Departmental guidelines, including SIGINT security, training,
authorities, accountability of resources, and oversight (inspections, skill evaluations, and
reporting).
   2.1. Guidance and policy for the management of cryptologic activities come from various
   sources at different levels. AF SCC remains current on all these guidance and policy
   documents to ensure USAF cryptologic activities are conducted within the parameters
   established by them.
   2.1. (AFISRA) The Commander, HQ AFISRA (AFISRA/CC) delegates operational
   oversight and functional management to the HQ AFISRA Director of Intelligence (A2) and
   Director of Operations (A3). As the AF SCC Director of Intelligence and Director of
   Operations, AFISRA/A2 and AFISRA/A3 exercise SCC oversight responsibility for USAF
   cryptologic operational activities. SCC oversight is comprised of two primary functions:
   implementing the legal authority to conduct SCC cryptologic missions on behalf of the
   NSA/CSS and monitoring the execution of cryptologic missions. Functional management
   includes all organize, train, and equip functions of all USAF cryptologic activities regardless
   of program to ensure these activities are postured to accomplish the mission and compliant
   with existing guidance and policy. Note: AFISRA will coordinate and deconflict with the
   command exercising primary ADCON when executing SCC management oversight over
   cryptologic elements assigned outside of AFISRA.
       2.1.1. Execute     AF/A2     responsibilities ensuring    proper    supervision      and
       administrative/technical control of USAF cryptologic intelligence activities, to include
       leading implementation of cryptologic tasking, planning, collection, processing and
       exploitation, analysis dissemination and interoperability between existing and future
       USAF, other Military Department, NSA/CSS, and USSOCOM SIGINT systems;
       seamless connectivity between national and tactical systems; and modernization of
       cryptologic systems.
