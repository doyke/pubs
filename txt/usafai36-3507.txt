1. Managing the Curriculum:
     1.1. The USAF Academy Catalog and the Curriculum Handbook explain the USAF
     Academy curriculum. Annual editions of the catalog contain course descriptions for courses
     taught in the coming year, as well as the graduation and majors" requirements for the cadet
     class that enters while the catalog is in effect. The Curriculum Handbook, updated annually,
     includes this information in greater detail, in addition to all academic practices and
     procedures, academic registration procedures, and academic probation information. The
     Curriculum Handbook is the definitive description of the Academy’s entire curriculum,
     including all courses, programs, and other experiences offered by the Dean of the Faculty
     (HQ USAFA/DF), the Commandant of Cadets, (HQ USAFA/CW), the Director of Athletics
     (HQ USAFA/AD), and the Commander, 306 Flying Training Group (306 FTG/CC).
     1.2. The Curriculum Handbook editor and the coordinator of the Curriculum Committee
     maintain the master Curriculum Handbook in the Office of the Registrar (HQ USAFA/DFR).
     The master Curriculum Handbook consists of the currently approved edition of the
     handbook, the originals of the approved curriculum change proposals, and all amplifying and
     clarifying information pertaining to a particular class, course, program, or experience.
     HQ USAFA/DFR issues Curriculum Handbooks to department heads, academic advisors,
     associate air officers commanding for academics (AAOCAs), cadets, and other appropriate
     USAFA activities. HQ USAFA/DFR revises the handbook annually, with interim publication
     of approved changes.
2. Academic Registration: The current Curriculum Handbook is the official publication for all
matters pertaining to the total registration cycle. Registration information includes how, when,
and under what conditions changes to cadets" current and future academic programs may be
made. The Academic Affairs and Curriculum Division, Office of the Registrar
(HQ USAFA/DFRC) publishes registration guidelines and deadlines.
3. Curriculum Change Procedures:
     3.1. Changes pertaining to a department's sectioning criteria, classroom requirements,
     numbers of sections for courses, or section size options require only a request from the
     department head to the Chief, Academic Scheduling and Customer Service Division
     (HQ USAFA/DFRR) of the Office of the Registrar. This request may be in the form of a
     memorandum to HQ USAFA/DFRR or as an annotated copy of the latest Master Course File
     (MCF).
     3.2. The curriculum change proposal process is designed for long-range planning that allows
     for all the changes to be printed in the Curriculum Handbook before they become effective.
     Academic departments, the Directorate of Athletics, and the Commandant of Cadets submit
     curriculum change proposals once each semester of each academic year to the Integrated
     Curriculum Review Committee for consideration by that committee. The Integrated
     Curriculum Review committee then forwards the change proposal, with recommendations, to
     the full USAFA Curriculum Committee. The effective date for each curriculum change
     proposal should be at least 1 year after submission. Prepare all curriculum change proposals
     (including those requiring coordination or approval of more than one academic department;
     Director of Athletics (HQ USAFA/AD); Dean of the Faculty (HQ USAFA/DF);
USAFAI36-3507 29 MARCH 2007                                                                3


  Commandant of Cadets (HQ USAFA/CW); or the Academy Board) and submit them through
  a USAFA Curriculum Committee representative to the Associate Dean for Student Academic
  Affairs and Academy Registrar (HQ USAFA/DFR). Only members of the USAFA
  Curriculum Committee have the authority to submit curriculum change proposals. USAFA
  Curriculum Committee members include the Dean of the Faculty (HQ USAFA/DF) (chair);
  the Vice Dean of the Faculty (HQ USAFA/DFV); the Associate Dean for Student Academic
  Affairs and Academy Registrar (HQ USAFA/DFR); the Deputy Registrar and Chief,
  Academic Affairs and Curriculum Division (HQ USAFA/DFRC) (non-voting); the Associate
  Dean for Curriculum and Strategy (HQ USAFA/DFA); all HQ USAFA/DF academic
  department heads; the Vice Commandant of Cadets (HQ USAFA/CWV); the Vice
  Commandant for Culture and Climate (HQ USAFA/CWP); the Director of Training and
  Support (HQ USAFA/CWT); the Director, Center for Character & Leadership Development
  (HQ USAFA/CWC); the Wing Director of Curriculum (HQ USAFA/CWVC); the Vice
  Athletic Director (HQ USAFA/ADV); the Deputy Director of Athletics and Head, Physical
  Education (HQ USAFA/ADP); the Director, Plans and Programs (HQ USAFA/A5/8/9) (non-
  voting); and the Director of Admissions (HQ USAFA/RR) (non-voting). In the case of a
  curriculum change proposal generated by the Cadet Wing, the Cadet Wing Commander
  submits the formal proposal through HQ USAFA/DF and HQ USAFA/CW to
  HQ USAFA/DFR.
  3.3. The Integrated Curriculum Review Committee is a sub-committee of the USAFA
  Curriculum Committee with a balanced composition across all mission elements. This
  committee reviews all curriculum change proposals, has decision authority over some (see
  Attachment 4) and forwards all others, with recommendations and review comments, to the
  USAFA Curriculum Committee. Independent of the curriculum change cycle, the Integrated
  Curriculum Review Committee meets regularly to share proposed curriculum changes and
  initiatives across mission elements, and to provide feedback and integration possibilities.
  Changes to the Academic Year Calendar and the USAFA Schedule of Calls are generated by
  (or flow through) the Integrated Curriculum Review Committee, are voted on by the USAFA
  Curriculum Committee, and forwarded to the Academy Board for final approval. The
  Integrated Curriculum Review Committee includes ten voting members: the Associate Dean
  for Student Academic Affairs and Academy Registrar (HQ USAFA/DFR); the Associate
  Dean for Curriculum and Strategy (HQ USAFA/DFA); 4 HQ USAFA/DF academic division
  representatives (one department head or Permanent Professor from each of the Basic
  Sciences, Engineering, Social Sciences, and Humanities divisions); the Wing Director of
  Curriculum (HQ USAFA/CWVC); the Chief of Training (HQ USAFA/CWTT); the Deputy
  Director, Center for Character & Leadership Development (HQ USAFA/CWC); and the Vice
  Director of Athletic Programs (HQ USAFA/ADPV). Additionally, the committee has four
  non-voting advisors: the Deputy Registrar and Chief, Academic Affairs and Curriculum
  division (HQ USAFA/DFRC); a representative from the 306th Flying Training Group (306
  FTG); and two representatives from Plans and Programs (HQ USAFA/A5/8/9).
  3.4. Type curriculum change proposals on plain bond paper and format them as shown in
  Attachment 2. Each proposal must include the following information:
     3.4.1. Short title.
     3.4.2. Classes affected.

       3.4.3. Effective date. (The effective date of the approved proposal should be at least 1
       year after its submission.)
       3.4.4. Purpose of and need for change.
       3.4.5. Description of changes required for the Curriculum Handbook and USAF
       Academy Catalog.
       3.4.6. Any other pertinent information and implications of the proposed change.
       3.4.7. Signature of a USAFA Curriculum Committee member, or in the case of a cadet
       proposal, signature of the Cadet Wing Commander and coordination by HQ USAFA/DF
       and HQ USAFA/CW.
       3.4.8. Type a coordination checklist on plain bond paper, format it as shown, and include
       it as an attachment to each curriculum change proposal.
    3.5. Course titles, descriptions, and numbers as follows:
       3.5.1. Brief, descriptive, and meaningful course titles. An abbreviated title of not more
       than 22 characters (including spaces) appears on each cadet's transcript.
       3.5.2. Each course description indicates the scope of the course, the semester hours of
       credit, the semesters when it is offered, special requirements (laboratory, field trips, and
       so forth), prerequisites, and whether it requires a final examination, final project, or final
       report.
       3.5.3. Number courses according to the following guidelines:
           3.5.3.1. The first digit of the three-digit course number indicates the class level at
           which you normally teach the course (100-level courses are normally taken during the
           Fourth Class year).
           3.5.3.2. The department offering the course coordinates with HQ USAFA/DFR to
           determine the second and third digit of each course number.
           3.5.3.3. A minor change in the course title or description does not require a change in
           the course number.
    3.6. A curriculum change proposal becomes official when the HQ USAFA/DFR receives it
    and assigns it a change proposal number.
    3.7. The final approving authority for most curriculum changes is the Academy Board, the
    USAFA Curriculum Committee, or the Integrated Curriculum Review Committee.
    Attachment 4 lists the levels of approval authority and coordination necessary for various
    changes. The Integrated Curriculum Review Committee meets to review all curriculum
    change proposals. It makes recommendations for those matters requiring USAFA Curriculum
    Committee approval. In turn, the USAFA Curriculum Committee makes recommendations
    for those matters that require Academy Board approval. Published requirements listed in the
    USAF Academy Catalog and the Curriculum Handbook must be approved by and
    coordinated with the individual or activity listed in the center column in Attachment 4.
    Required coordination is shown in parentheses.
    3.8. The right column of Attachment 4 lists the individual or activity having authority to
    make a variation to the published requirements for an individual cadet. Prepare waivers
USAFAI36-3507 29 MARCH 2007                                                                    5


   requiring department or higher approval on USAFA Form 69, Academic Waiver Request.
   USAFA Form 69 is a form filled in by the academic advisor/AAOCA, signed by the
   appropriate department head, and forwarded to HQ USAFA/DFR. After obtaining
   coordination and approvals, HQ USAFA/DFR forwards the USAFA Form 69 to
   HQ USAFA/DFRR for appropriate changes. HQ USAFA/DFRR retains the original copy of
   the form in the cadet’s record. The term "department" applies to divisions in all cases
   involving divisional majors and courses and to the Deputy Director of Athletics and Head,
   Physical Education (HQ USAFA/ADP) when involving courses under that agency's
   responsibility.
