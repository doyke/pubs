SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision incorporates and reorganizes the requirements, information, and procedures formerly in
AFR 55-20; includes a new provision exempting Coast Guard auxiliary aircraft from the requirement for
a landing permit (paragraph 3.2.); adds a new requirement for corporations to resubmit the DD Form 2402
every 5 years (paragraph 5.1.); adds aerial performance, dependents of both active and retired military
personnel, and civil reserve air fleet (CRAF) alternate as new purposes for use (Table 1.); adds Coast
Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration personnel as authorized uniformed service
users (Table 1.); adds all retired uniformed service members with military identification cards as autho-
rized retired military users (Table 1.); eliminates receipt of retirement pay as a prerequisite for issuing a
permit to retired members of the Reserve Forces (Table 1.); adds a requirement that notification of unau-
thorized landings be provided on FAA forms (paragraph 10.1.2.); adds the list of weather alternates for
scheduled air carriers (Attachment 2); adds landing permit application instructions (Attachment 3); and
aligns this instruction with AFPD 10-10. Changed material from previous edition is indicated by a | .
(MCGUIRE) This publication has been revised and must be completely reviewed. This version incorpo-
rates new policy on approving foreign government aircraft landing at McGuire AFB. It removes the term
Base Operations and inserts the term Airfield Management Operations. Removes term Security Police
(SP) and inserts term Security Forces (SF).

AFI10-1001_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2008                                                                   7


      ment) at airfields for which they hold oversight responsibilities. Additionally, for expeditious han-
      dling of short notice requests, they may grant requests for one-time, official Government business
      flights that are in the best interest of the US Government and do not violate other provisions of this
      instruction. As a minimum, for one-time flights authorized under this paragraph, the aircraft
      owner or operator must provide the decision authority with insurance verification and a completed
      DD Form 2402 before the aircraft operates into the Air Force airfield. Air Force authority to
      approve civil aircraft use of Air Force airfields on foreign soil may be limited. Commanders out-
      side the US must be familiar with base rights agreements or other international agreements
      that may render inapplicable, in part or in whole, provisions of this instruction. Decision
      authority is delegated for specific purposes of use and or locations as follows:

          charter is to transport goods and or materials, such as an electric generator or construction
          materials for a community center, for the benefit of remote communities that do not have ade-
          quate civil airports.
          2.4.2.2. Commander, Air Mobility Command (AMC). The Commander, AMC or a desig-
          nated representative may approve permits that grant landing rights at Air Force airfields
          worldwide in support of AMC contracts.
          2.4.2.3. US Defense Attache Office (USDAO). The USDAO, acting on behalf of HQ
          USAF/XOOBC, may grant a request for one-time landing rights at an Air Force airfield pro-
          vided:
             •   The request is for official Government business of either the US or the country to
                 which the USDAO is accredited.
             •   The Air Force airfield is located within the country to which the USDAO is accredited.
             •   Approval will not violate any agreement with the host country.
             •   The installation commander concurs.

NOTES:
1. Landing fees are charged for White House Press Corps flights. Landing fees are not charged if the Air
Force has invited media coverage of specific events.
2. Landing fees are charged if flight is not operating in support of official Government business.
3. Landing fees are charged unless US Government charters have reciprocal privileges in the foreign
country.
     6.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) In accordance with United States foreign operating agreements, Canada
     and Great Britain have indefinite authorization (on file at AM Ops) to land government-owned and
     military aircraft at USAF installations. Notify SFCC and Office of Special Investigation (OSI) of
     inbound foreign aircraft. Make all remaining inbound notifications for these aircraft as normal tran-
     sient traffic notifications.

7. Insurance Requirements. Applicants must provide proof of third-party liability insurance on a DD
Form 2400, with the amounts stated in US dollars. The policy number, effective date, and expiration date
are required. The statement "until canceled" may be used in lieu of a specific expiration date. The geo-
graphic coverage must include the area where the Air Force airfield of proposed use is located. If several
aircraft or aircraft types are included under the same policy, a statement such as "all aircraft owned," "all
aircraft owned and or operated," "all non-owned aircraft," or "all aircraft operated," may be used in lieu of
aircraft registration numbers. To meet the insurance requirements, either split limit coverage for bodily
injury (individuals outside the aircraft), property damage, and passengers, or a single limit coverage is
required. The coverage will be at the expense of the user with an insurance company acceptable to the Air
Force. Coverage must be current during the period the Air Force airfield will be used. The liability
required is computed on the basis of aircraft maximum gross takeoff weight (MGTOW) and passenger or
cargo configuration. Minimum coverage will not be less than the amount indicated in Table 2.

   7.1. Any insurance presented as a single limit of liability or a combination of primary and excess cov-
   erage will be an amount equal to or greater than the each accident minimums indicated in Table 2. for
   bodily injury (individuals outside the aircraft), property damage, and passengers.

   7.2. The policy will specifically provide that:
      •   The insurer waives any right of subrogation it may have against the US by reason of any pay-
          ment made under the policy for injury, death, or property damage that might arise, out of or in
          connection with the insured's use of any Air Force airfield.
      •   The insurance afforded by the policy applies to the liability assumed by the insured under DD
          Form 2402.
      •   If the insurer or the insured cancels or reduces the amount of insurance afforded under the
          listed policy before the expiration date indicated on DD Form 2400, the insurer will send writ-
          ten notice of policy cancellation or coverage reduction to the Air Force approving authority at
          least 30 days before the effective date of the cancellation or reduction. The policy must state
          that any cancellation or reduction will not be effective until at least 30 days after such notice is
          sent.

8. Processing a Permit Application. Upon receipt of an application (DD Forms 2400, 2401, and 2402)
for use of an Air Force airfield, the decision authority:

     requested.
     8.2. Determines the validity of the request and ensures all entries on DD Forms 2400, 2401, and 2402
     are in conformance with this instruction.
     8.3. Approves DD Form 2401 (with conditions or limitations noted) by completing all items in Sec-
     tion II - For Use by Approving Authority as follows:
        8.3.1. Period of Use (Block 7). The "From" date will be either the first day of approved use or the
        first day of insurance coverage. The "From" date cannot precede the first day of insurance cover-
        age shown on the DD Form 2400. The "Thru" date is determined by the insurance expiration date
        and or the purpose of use. For example, the period of use for participants in an Air Force open
        house will be determined by both insurance coverage and open house dates. The permit would be
        issued only for the duration of the open house but must not precede or exceed the dates of insur-
        ance coverage. Many insurance policies terminate at noon on the expiration date. Therefore, if
        the insurance expiration is used to determine the permit expiration date, the landing permit will
        expire one day before the insurance expiration date shown on the DD Form 2400. If the insurance
        expiration date either exceeds 2 years or is indefinite (for example, "until canceled"), the landing
        permit will expire 2 years from the issue date or first day of coverage.
        8.3.2. Frequency of Use (Block 8) is normally "as required" but may be more specific, such as
        "one time."
        8.3.3. Identification Number (Block 9). Installation commanders or a designated representative
        assign a permit number comprised of the last three letters of the installation's International Civil
        Aviation Organization identifier code, the last two digits of the calendar year, a number sequen-
        tially assigned, and the letter suffix that indicates the purpose of use (Table 1.); for example,
        ADW 95-01C. MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and USDAOs use a three position organization abbre-
        viation; such as AMC 95-02K.
        8.3.4. DD Form 2400 (Dated and Filed) (Block 11a). This block should contain the date from
        block 1 (Date Issued) on the DD Form 2400 and the identification of the unit or base where the
        form was approved; i.e., 30 March 1995, HQ USAF/XOOBC.
        8.3.5. DD Form 2402 (Dated and Filed) (Block 11b). This block should contain the date from
        block 4 (Date Signed) on the DD Form 2402 and the identification of the unit or base where the
        form was approved; i.e., 30 March 1995, HQ USAF/XOOBC.
        8.3.6. SA-ALC/SFR, 1014 Andrews Road, Building 1621, Kelly AFB TX 78241-5603 publishes
        the list of companies authorized to purchase Air Force fuel on credit. Block 12 should be marked
        "yes" only if the permit holder's name appears on the SA-ALC list.
        8.3.7. Landing Fees, Block 13, should be marked as indicated in Table 1.
        8.3.8. Permit Amendments. New entries or revisions to an approved DD Form 2401 may be
        made only by or with the consent of the approving authority.
     8.4. Provides the applicant with written disapproval if:
        •   Use will interfere with operations, security, or safety.
        •   Adequate civil facilities are collocated.
AFI10-1001_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2008                                                                     23


       •   Purpose of use is not official Government business and adequate civil facilities are available
           in the proximity of the requested Air Force airfield.
       •   Use will constitute competition with civil airports or air carriers.
       •   Applicant has not fully complied with this instruction.
   8.5. Distributes the approved DD Form 2401 before the first intended landing, when possible, as fol-
   lows:
       •   Retains original.
       •   Returns two copies to the user.
       •   Provides a copy to HQ USAF/XOOBC. NOTE: HQ USAF/XOOBC will provide a computer
           report of current landing permits to the MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and installations.

9. Civil Fly-Ins. Civil aircraft operators may be invited to a specified Air Force airfield for:
   •   A base open house to perform or provide a static display.
   •   A flying safety seminar.
   9.1. Civil Fly-In Procedures:
       9.1.1. The installation commander or a designated representative:
           •   Requests approval from the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU with an information copy to HQ
               USAF/XOOBC/XOOO and SAF/PAC.
           •   Ensures that DD Form 2402 is completed by each user. NOTE: DD Forms 2400 and
               2401 are not required for fly-in participants if flying activity consists of a single landing
               and takeoff with no spectators other than flightline or other personnel required to support
               the aircraft operations.
       9.1.2. The MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU ensures HQ USAF/XOOBC/XOOO and SAF/PAC are
       advised of the approval or disapproval for the fly-in.
NOTE: Aerial performance by civil aircraft requires MAJCOM or FOA approval and an approved land-
ing permit as specified in AFI 35-201, Community Relations. Regardless of the aircraft's historic military
significance, DD Forms 2400, 2401, and 2402 must be submitted and approved before the performance.
The permit can be approved at MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, or installation level. Use will be authorized only
for the period of the event. Fly-in procedures do not apply to aircraft transporting passengers (revenue or
non-revenue) for the purpose of attending the open house or demonstration flights associated with market-
ing a product.

10. Unauthorized Landings:
   10.1. Unauthorized Landing Procedures. The installation commander or a designated representa-
   tive will identify an unauthorized landing as either an emergency landing, an inadvertent landing, or
   an intentional landing. An unauthorized landing may be designated as inadvertent or intentional
   whether or not the operator has knowledge of the provisions of this instruction, and whether or not the
   operator filed a flight plan identifying the installation as a destination. Aircraft must depart the instal-
   lation as soon as practical. On all unauthorized landings, the installation commander or a designated
   representative:
24                                                 AFI10-1001_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2008


        10.1.1. Informs the operator of AFI 10-1001 procedures and the requirement for notifying the
        Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as specified in Section 6 of the FAA Airman's Information
        Manual.
        10.1.2. Notifies the Federal Aviation Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) by telephone or
        telefax, followed by written notification using FAA Form 8020-9, 8020-11, or 8020-17, as appro-
        priate. A copy of the written notification must be provided to HQ USAF/XOOBC.
        10.1.3. Ensures the operator completes a DD Form 2402, and collects applicable charges. (In
        some instances, it may be necessary to arrange to bill the user for the appropriate charges.) DD
        Form 2402 need not be completed for commercial carriers if it is known that the form is already
        on file at HQ USAF/XOOBC.
        10.1.4. In a foreign country, notifies the local US Defense Attache Office (USDAO) by telephone
        or telefax and, where applicable, the appropriate USDAO in the country of aircraft registry, fol-
        lowed by written notification with an information copy to HQ USAF/XOOBC and the civil avia-
        tion authority of the country or countries concerned.
     10.2. Emergency Landings. Any aircraft operator who experiences an inflight emergency may
     land at any Air Force airfield without prior authorization (approved DD Form 2401 and 24 hours
     prior notice). An inflight emergency is a situation that makes continued flight hazardous.
        10.2.1. The Air Force will use any method or means to clear an aircraft or wreckage from the run-
        way to preclude interference with essential military operations after coordinating with the FSDO
        and National Transportation Safety Board. Removal efforts will minimize damage to the aircraft
        or wreckage; however, military or other operational factors may be overriding.
        10.2.2. An operator making an emergency landing:
           10.2.2.1. Is not charged a landing fee.
           10.2.2.2. Pays all costs for labor, material, parts, use of equipment and tools, and so forth, to
           include, but not limited to:
               •   Spreading foam on the runway.
               •   Damage to runway, lighting, and navigation aids.
               •   Rescue, crash, and fire control services.
               •   Movement and storage of aircraft.
               •   Performance of minor maintenance.
               •   Fuel or oil (AFM 67-1, vol 1, part three, chapter 1, Air Force Stock Fund and DPSC
                   Assigned Item Procedures).
     10.3. Inadvertent Unauthorized Landings:
        10.3.1. The installation commander or a designated representative may determine a landing to be
        inadvertent if the aircraft operator:
           •   Landed due to flight disorientation.
           •   Mistook the Air Force airfield for a civil airport.
AFI10-1001_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2008                                                              25


     10.3.2. Normal landing fees must be charged and an unauthorized landing fee may be
     assessed to compensate the Government for the added time, effort, and risk involved in the inad-
     vertent landing. Only the unauthorized landing fee may be waived by the installation com-
     mander or a designated representative if, after interviewing the pilot-in-command and appropriate
     Government personnel, it is determined that flying safety was not significantly impaired. The
     pilot-in-command may appeal the imposition of an unauthorized landing fee for an inadvertent
     landing to the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU whose decision will be final. A subsequent inadvertent
     landing will be processed as an intentional unauthorized landing.
  10.4. Intentional Unauthorized Landings:
     10.4.1. The installation commander may categorize an unauthorized landing as intentional when
     there is unequivocal evidence that the pilot deliberately:
        10.4.1.1. Landed without an approved DD Form 2401 on board the aircraft.
        10.4.1.2. Landed for a purpose not approved on the DD Form 2401.
        10.4.1.3. Operated an aircraft not of a model or registration number on the approved DD
        Form 2401.
        10.4.1.4. Did not request or obtain the required final approval from the installation com-
        mander or a designated representative at least 24 hours before aircraft arrival.
        10.4.1.5. Did not obtain landing clearance from the air traffic control tower.
        10.4.1.6. Landed with an expired DD Form 2401.
        10.4.1.7. Obtained landing authorization through fraudulent methods, or
        10.4.1.8. Landed after having been denied a request to land from any Air Force authority,
        including the control tower.
     10.4.2. Normal landing fees and an unauthorized landing fee must be charged. Intentional unau-
     thorized landings increase reporting, processing, and staffing costs; therefore, the unauthorized
     landing fee for 10.4.1.1. through 10.4.1.6. will be increased by 100 percent. The unauthorized
     landing fee will be increased 200 percent for 10.4.1.7. and 10.4.1.8.
     10.4.3. Intentional unauthorized landings may be prosecuted as a criminal trespass, especially if a
     debarment letter has been issued. Repeated intentional unauthorized landings prejudice the user's
     FAA operating authority and jeopardize future use of Air Force airfields.
  10.5. Detaining an Aircraft:
     10.5.1. An installation commander in the United States, its territories, or its possessions may
     choose to detain an aircraft for an intentional unauthorized landing until:
        •   The unauthorized landing has been reported to the FAA, HQ USAF/XOOBC, and the
            appropriate US Attorney.
        •   All applicable charges have been paid.
     10.5.2. If the installation commander wishes to release the aircraft before the investigation is
     completed, he or she must obtain bond, promissory note, or other security for payment of the high-
     est charge that may be assessed.
26                                                  AFI10-1001_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 9 APRIL 2008


        10.5.3. The pilot and passengers will not be detained longer than is necessary for identification,
        although they may be permitted to remain in a lounge or other waiting area on the base at their
        request for such period as the installation commander may determine (normally not to exceed
        close of business hours at the home office of the entity owning the aircraft, if the operator does not
        own the aircraft). No person, solely due to an intentional unauthorized landing, will be detained
        involuntarily after identification is complete without coordination from the appropriate US Attor-
        ney, the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU, and HQ USAF/XOOBC.

11. Parking and Storage. The time that an aircraft spends on an installation is at the discretion of the
installation commander or a designated representative but should be linked to the purpose of use autho-
rized. Parking and storage may be permitted on a nonexclusive, temporary, or intermittent basis, when
compatible with military requirements. At those locations where there are Air Force aero clubs, parking
and storage privileges may be permitted in the area designated for aero club use without regard for the
purpose of use authorized, if consistent with aero club policies. Any such permission may be revoked
upon notice, based on military needs and the installation commander's discretion.

12. Fees for Landing, Parking, and Storage:
     12.1. Landing, parking, and storage fees (Table 3. and Table 4.) are determined by aircraft maximum
     gross takeoff weight (MGTOW). All fees are normally due and collectable at the time of use of the
     Air Force airfield. DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, is used to deposit the fees with the base
     accounting and finance officer. In some instances, it may be necessary to bill the user for charges
     incurred.

   or for any purpose, the cost of which is subject to reimbursement by the US Government. Parking
   and Storage Fees (Table 4.) are charged if an aircraft must remain beyond the period necessary to
   conduct official Government business and for all non-official Government business operations.
