                                             Chapter 1

                                   GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Introduction. This document describes Air Force Reserve Command’s approach to
determining causal findings and other findings of significance to assist safety investigation board
(SIB) members in developing formal recommendations for mishap reports. Its origin stems from
the desire to help investigating officers (IO) maximize the mishap prevention value of their
mishap reports. A good report results in a recommendation(s) that tackles the root cause or
causes of a mishap. Far too often SIBs stop investigating once the board discovers what or what
or who appears to be the cause of the mishap. Unfortunately, it is human nature to stop there and
not to continue further and ask why the cause occurred or why the individual might have made a
mistake--in effect, identify a root cause. Without a root cause identified, the SIB developed
recommendations will prove ineffective in mishap prevention.
1.2. What is Causal Finding Analysis Methodology (CFAM)? CFAM is a six-step
methodology used to determine: (1) What happened; (2) Why it happened; and (3) What to do to
prevent it from happening again. CFAM consists of a simple diagram of events that become a
draft set of findings for input into AFSAS and a Machine, Media, Man, Management and
Method (5M) checklist (see Attachment 1) that assists the SIB members in pursuing areas
outside of their expertise. Keep in mind that CFAM is a methodology. It is not meant to be a
replacement for USAF mishap investigation principles, but a supplement to the Air Force
investigative process. AFPAM 91-211 checklist items in attachment 3 still need to be reviewed.
1.3. Reasons to use CFAM. There are six reasons to utilize CFAM:
     1.3.1. Contributes to better organized investigation and report.
     1.3.2. Provides a ready-made plan for conducting an investigation.
     1.3.3. Simplifies a complex process.
     1.3.4. Can be used as a time/effort management tool for SIB Presidents.
     1.3.5. Makes investigation and report writing easier by providing a more structured and
     standard method to accomplish both.
     1.3.6. Bottom line - Develop better recommendations for mishap prevention.
1.4. Required Tools.
     1.4.1. A large wall or desk for a work space.
     1.4.2. A roll of butcher paper or large easel pad.
        1.4.2.1. Note: The butcher paper makes it possible to save your work or to take it with
        you when you change locations. For example, simply roll it up and set it aside while you
        wait for your engine analysis from depot. You’ll be able to unroll it months later and
        pick up where you left off. It will also provide a historical and visual record of your
        work.
     1.4.3. Masking tape.
     1.4.4. Two different colored adhesive notes.

                                             Chapter 2

                         SIX STEPS TO THE ROOT CAUSE – STEP 1

2.1. Determine the mishap sequence of events.
     2.1.1. The objective of this step is to create a draft set of findings. Using one color of your
     adhesive notes, start on the far right of your work space and post the mishap sequence of
     events in reverse chronological order. Each event must be a singular statement. Avoid using
     “and” to prevent having two events on one Adhesive note. Each event must have a logical
     connection to a preceding event. If no logical relationship exists, then you have not yet
     correctly described the mishap sequence.
     2.1.1.1. The sequence will read left to right when complete. It must continue to the point
     where all damage or rescue efforts are complete. In some cases the chain of events may
     begin with design deficiencies or improperly written directives prepared long before the
     actual mishap sequence. The key sequence is Design/TCTO/Regulations/Training/Mishap.
     That is the order aircraft are designed and fielded. Many times SIBS have a tendency to put
     guidance or training first and then design. The correct order is; first the design, then the
     TO’s, then regulatory guidance, which results in the training plan and then the mishap.
        2.1.1.2. You will start on the far right because you know where the mishap ended, but
        you don’t yet know where it began.
     2.1.2. For the purpose of example, we will diagram a hypothetical mishap involving an
     aircraft that blew nine main landing gear (MLG) tires while performing a rejected takeoff
     after striking a large bird 10 knots below “GO speed”. See figure 2.1 for help in visualizing
     Step 1.
     2.1.3. Step 1 is complete once the sequence of events is firmly established.

Figure 2.1. Step 1 Determine the mishap sequence of events.

                       SIX STEPS TO THE ROOT CAUSE – STEP 2

3.1. Indentify potential causal areas or factors.
   3.1.1. The objective of this step is to determine areas requiring further investigation. All
   events that led to damage or injury deserve a closer look and will be identified by placing a
   mark on the Adhesive note.
   3.1.2. In our example, we have two events in which damaged occurred: “Mishap Aircraft
   (MA) blew 9 MLG tires”, and “MA struck large bird 10 KTS below GO speed”. We’ll mark
   those events by placing a red dot in the left hand corner of each Adhesive note. Note: If a
   crew member had been injured during the egress we would need to mark it also to determine
   why it happened to prevent it from happening again. Refer to Figure 3.1 below.
   3.1.3. Step 2 is complete once all areas requiring further investigation are identified.

                                               Chapter 4

                          SIX STEPS TO THE ROOT CAUSE – STEP 3

4.1. Ask ―Why‖ of the potential causal areas.
     4.1.1. The objective of this step is to drill into the areas identified in Step 2.
     4.1.2. So how do you drill into those areas? First, use your intuition and experience as an
     aviator to ask what may have caused each of these events. Next, refer to the 5M Checklist
     (attachment 1) for ideas that you might have overlooked. Annotate each adhesive with the
     respective condition number (i.e. “2.5”, or “3.5E”) from the 5M checklist. This will make
     your life easier when it comes time to make your recommendations.
         4.1.2.1. Note: The 5M checklist divides your potential factors into five categories:
         Machine, Media, Man, Management, and Method.
     4.1.3. Place a new color adhesive note above the highlighted finding with the factor or
     condition that you want to explore further. State each factor in the form of a statement, not
     as a question (the reason for this will become apparent later).
         4.1.3.1. Try to avoid the tendency to use single words in place of complete statements.
         Incomplete statements may make sense at the time, but if you have to put your
         investigation on hold for long period of time, you may have a tough time trying to figure
         out exactly what you meant.
     4.1.4. For our example, you would place a new color adhesive note above “MA blew 9 MLG
     tires” that might read “MA had defective tires” and another above that note stating “MA
     antiskid failed” and another one above that with “MP incorrectly applied brakes” and so on.
     These will be the areas that you or the SIB will need to examine. See Figure 4.1 below.
     4.1.5. Step 3 is complete once you have exhausted all the possibilities of why the event
     occurred.

                                          Chapter 5

                      SIX STEPS TO THE ROOT CAUSE – STEP 4

5.1. Determine Causal Factors.
   5.1.1. The objective of this step is to identify your Causal Factors and/or Other Findings of
   Significance. Investigate the mishap or event based on your intuition/experience and the
   questions raised in the 5M checklist. Dig deeply into each factor or condition from Step 3 to
   discover the actual root cause(s) that can be corrected to prevent future mishaps. As you do
   this you will eliminate several adhesive notes.
      5.1.1.1. Once a condition is eliminated (disproved), such as “MA had defective tires”,
      you will place a large “X” over the text and move the adhesive underneath that event.
      The intent is to keep digging into each condition until all of the adhesive notes are moved
      below the event sequence line. Any condition not X’d out (proven correct) will likely be
      a Causal Factor or Other Findings of Significance for that event.
          5.1.1.1.1. Note: Conditions that are eliminated may later be addressed as “Non-
          Factors Worthy of Discussion” when writing the final report.
   5.1.2. In our example in Figure 5.1, you determine that the MP correctly applied brakes and
   that the antiskid had, in fact, failed. Place a large “X” over “MP incorrectly applied brakes”
   and move it “below the line.” Since “MA antiskid failed” was proven to be correct it is
   moved below the line without an “X” to complete this step. You also determined all BASH
   requirements were met and ruled out all three potential factors. This is illustrated by X-ing
   out all of these three factors in figure 5.1.
      5.1.2.1. Note: As you interview mishap personnel and review the technical data, you
      may generate additional adhesive notes (conditions) to stick above an event. You may
      even expand your sequence of events as details come to light.
      5.1.2.2. You may also have additional adhesive notes that are not Causal Factors or
      Other Findings of Significance such as “waiting on an answer from a depot teardown
      request” or results from a “potentially contaminated fluid sample” that you can put in a
      “holding area” in the bottom right of your work area as a reminder for the SIB.
   5.1.3. This step is complete once all of your adhesive notes are below “the line” as shown in
   figure 5.1.

                                           Chapter 6

                      SIX STEPS TO THE ROOT CAUSE – STEP 5

6.1. Reconstruct the sequence of events and repeat Step 3.
   6.1.1. The objective of this step is to complete your draft findings by inserting the non-X’d
   out factors into the sequence of events. We’ll repeat the methodology used in steps 3 and 4
   until we reach a logical conclusion. Once the non-X’d out factors are inserted into the
   sequence and you can go no further, this step is complete.
   6.1.2. In our example, we determined the antiskid system failed. This appears to be a Causal
   Factor, but we still don’t know why this happened. Before we start with step 3, we’ll insert
   the “MA antiskid failed” adhesive into the proper point in the sequence of events. In our
   case it was just prior to “MA blew 9 MLG tires”. Next, we treat this factor as another event
   to research and start putting Adhesive notes above the line just as we did earlier. See figure
   6.1 and 6.2 for a visual illustration.
       6.1.2.1. Previously, in Step 2 you were told not to use questions or single word
       statements. It should now be apparent that neither of these would smoothly fit into our
       sequence of events and would need to be rewritten.
       6.1.2.2. Note: Causes (or “causal findings”) are those findings that singularly or in
       combination with other causes resulted in the damage or injury that occurred. They may
       be:
          6.1.2.2.1. Deficiencies or decisions, which if corrected, eliminated, or avoided would
          likely have prevented or mitigated the mishap damage or significant injuries.
          6.1.2.2.2. Acts, omissions, conditions, or circumstances that either start or sustain the
          mishap sequence.
          6.1.2.2.3. An element of human or mechanical performance.
          6.1.2.2.4. An environmental condition (if it was not reasonably avoidable).
   6.1.3. Not all of your non-X’d out Adhesive notes will be causal or Other Findings of
   Significance (OFS). If your original sequence had holes, the methodology will fill those
   holes. To determine if a factor is causal review paragraph 7.14.3.2.
AFRCPAM91-201 5 JANUARY 2012                                                                13

Figure 6.2. Reconstruct the Sequence of events 2.




   6.1.4. In the case of our example, we’ve determined that the antiskid failed due to improper
   maintenance. We still have not reached a logical conclusion because we don’t know why the
   maintenance was performed improperly. A SIB would need to keep repeating the cycle until
14                                                      AFRCPAM91-201 5 JANUARY 2012


  it could no longer ask “why”. For the purposes of this pamphlet we’ll stop here. If it were an
  actual investigation, the SIB may have determined that the improper maintenance was due to
  an inadequate training program, improper supervision, etc. The point here is to not stop the
  investigation and assign cause to the crew chief that performed the procedure.
  Unfortunately, too many SIBs will stop at this point.
  6.1.5. Your causal findings will now stand out in the event sequence since they are a
  different color. Since you wrote each condition as a factual statement, it easily fits into the
  sequence of events without any rewording. Now you have a solid draft of the Findings,
  Causes, and Analysis to enter into AFSAS. Your recommendations can easily be formulated
  by referring to the respective condition number and its corresponding potential
  recommendations found in the 5M checklist (see attachment 1). See Figure 6.3
     6.1.5.1. Final note: All too often investigators assign training as a recommendation
     without fully exploring whether training is the real fix. If your causal findings and
     recommendations include training as a recommendation, run attachment 2 as a test before
     you make your final report. Attachment 2 will take the investigator through a quick
     decision tree analysis of when to recommend, but more importantly, when not to
     recommend training as the answer. If a worker has the skills and knowledge to do the job
     safely then training will not address the unsafe job performance. Problems that can be
     addressed effectively by training include those that arise from a lack of knowledge of a
     work process, unfamiliarity with equipment, or incorrect execution of a task. This is not
     to say that safety and health training is not an important part of a mishap prevention
     program. Safety training and education are a vital element of any effective safety
     program. Some of the appropriate times when safety and health training should be
     provided are:
         6.1.5.1.1. A worker lacks the safety skills.
         6.1.5.1.2. A new employee is hired.
         6.1.5.1.3. An employee is transferred to another job or task.
         6.1.5.1.4. Changes are made to operating procedures.
         6.1.5.1.5. A worker has not performed a task for some period of time.
  6.1.6. At this point you can review/edit the complete sequence of events and input into
  AFSAS. This will also help you draft the narrative correctly and efficiently. Remember,
  conditions or factors that were X'd out may be discussed in the narrative as areas investigated
  and found to be non-factors, i.e., Non-Factors Worthy of Discussion. Don’t forget to include
  Other Findings of Significance (OFS).

                                            Chapter 7

                       SIX STEPS TO THE ROOT CAUSE – STEP 6

7.1. Write the AFSAS final report.
   7.1.1. The objective of this step is to assist the investigator in organizing the AFSAS final
   message from the data gathered during steps one through five. Log on to AFSAS at
   https://afsas.kirtland.af.mil/Home.do. Guidance is also available in AFI 91-204 and
   AFMAN 91-223.
   7.1.2. Populate sections 1 through 3 as prompted by AFSAS (most are self-explanatory).
   Section 4 is the Narrative, which will be blank/unformatted and will accept any text.
   Consider drafting the Narrative in Word, then pasting it into AFSAS. We recommend the
   following format for Section 4. You should title each section as indicated below:
7.2. AFSAS 4.1. Synopsis:
   7.2.1. Provide a brief statement of what you investigated. Examples: The mishap aircraft
   (MA) sustained damage to its left wing leading edge as a result of a wildlife strike. Or,
   mishap member 1 (MM1) failed to remove an inspection mirror from the number two engine
   inlet, resulting in foreign object damage.
7.3. AFSAS 4.2. Mission Overview: Enter a brief description of the planned mission profile or
planned maintenance actions. Do not say what actually happened. Do not include any analysis.
Just describe the plan. For example: The mission was a planned refueling sortie from McGuire
AFB, NJ to NAS Rota, Spain. The mishap receiver aircraft (MRA) was a C-5B assigned to the
439th AW, Westover ARB, MA. The mishap tanker aircraft (MTA) was a KC-135R assigned to
the 916th ARW, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC. The MRA’s first leg was planned from Westover
ARB to Dover AFB, Delaware to on-load 167,000 pounds of cargo
7.4. AFSAS 4.3. Mishap Sequence of Events: Insert a chronological sequence of events in
narrative format, detailing the events of the mishap. This should include all pertinent events in
the sequence such as a detailed discussion of the flight briefing or maintenance briefing, ground
operations, takeoff, etc. through the mishap sequence, search and rescue, and description of the
mishap site/location. Time of significant events should be integrated. Do not place analysis in
this section. Simply describe the “facts” of the mishap. More is better than less -- when in doubt,
put it in.
7.5. AFSAS 4.4. Mishap Crew or Maintenance Personnel Involved: A description of the
personnel involved goes here, to include qualifications, recent experience, etc. Provide
background information pertinent to the investigation on the mishap crewmembers, maintenance
members (in chronological order; mishap member 1[MM1], mishap member 2 [MM2], etc.),
leadership members, or others that affected the mishap. Background information may include,
but is not limited to, information on training, upgrades, promotions, deployments, 30/60/90 day
totals and summary of 72 hour/14 day histories. Simply describe the “facts” of the personnel
involved in the mishap.
7.6. AFSAS 4.5. Investigation and Analysis: Include not only what was/were factor(s) in the
mishap sequence, but what was ruled out and why. Explain the process used to arrive at the
AFRCPAM91-201 5 JANUARY 2012                                                                  17


conclusions. If an issue could have “reasonably” been a factor in the mishap sequence but was
not, explain in the Non-Factors Worthy of Discussion section how the SIB determined it was not
a factor. Not all non-factors need to be discussed. Reference AFMAN 91-223, chapter 6 for a
discussion of Factors, Non-Factors Worthy of Discussion and Non-Factors.
   7.6.1. A “factor” is any unusual, out-of-the-ordinary, or deficient action or condition
   discovered in the course of a mishap investigation, which in the SIB’s opinion contributed to
   the eventual outcome, or is indicative of a pattern of less than adequate decisions or
   conditions. Each Factor and Non-Factor Worthy of Discussion should be analyzed in a
   separate paragraph.
   7.6.2. Use the “overview, analysis, and conclusion” format for each Factor and Non-Factor
   Worthy of Discussion, as shown below.
       7.6.2.1. Overview: Brief discussion of the Factor/Non-Factor Worthy of Discussion.
       7.6.2.2. Analysis: SIB method to determine the factor’s influence on the mishap scenario.
       Include enough information so the reader can logically follow the SIB’s rationale for
       conclusions reached. It should include references to specific Technical
       Orders/Publications, training received, actions accomplished, results of technical
       analysis, toxicology testing, etc.
       7.6.2.3. Conclusion: Summarize whether the topic was or was not a factor, and if the
       factor was causal in the mishap sequence.
   7.6.3. For example: AFSAS 4.4.1.1.x. Channelized Attention:
       7.6.3.1. Overview: The SIB considered Channelized attention as a possible factor in the
       mishap. Channelized attention is a factor when the individual is focusing conscious
       attention on a limited number of environmental cues to the exclusion of others of
       subjectively equal, higher, or more immediate priority leading to an unsafe situation.
       7.6.3.2. Analysis: The mishap pilot was focused on taxiing the aircraft and executing the
       180-degree turn for the opposite direction departure; the mishap crew’s attention was
       focused inside the aircraft running the Lineup Check. Neither considered the impending
       conflict with the B-4 stand.
       7.6.3.3. Conclusion: Channelized attention was a factor in the mishap.
7.7. AFSAS 4.5.1. Operations Areas Investigated: Topics should include analysis of the
mishap pilot’s background, qualifications, mission planning, ORM applied, operations
supervision, etc. For a thorough list of operations factors to consider, see AFPAM 91-211,
Attachment 4. Topics should flow chronologically if possible. Include human factors write-ups
related to operations personnel in this section. Also include life support, egress, survival, and
rescue issues in this section.
7.8. AFSAS 4.5.1.1. Factors.
   7.8.1. Each Factor should be analyzed in a separate paragraph. Use the “overview, analysis,
   and conclusion” format for each (see example above).
   7.8.2. Non-Factors Worthy of Discussion. Each Non-Factor Worthy of Discussion should
   be analyzed in a separate paragraph. Again, use the “overview, analysis, and conclusion”
   format for each.
 18                                                      AFRCPAM91-201 5 JANUARY 2012


   7.8.3. Non-Factors. A list of areas you considered but were not determined to be worthy of
   discussion goes here. For example: Proficiency, Radar Facilities, Airfield Equipment,
   Navigation Aids, Training, Air Traffic Control, Charts and Maps, Mission Familiarization,
   Cockpit Environment, Life Support Equipment, Mission preflight etc.
7.9. AFSAS 4.5.2.        Maintenance/Logistics Areas Investigated: Topics should include
mishap aircraft’s background/history, aircraft records, engine history, recent maintenance
performed, maintenance training, logistics issues, results of technical teardowns and analysis,
etc. For a thorough list of maintenance/logistics factors to consider, see AFPAM 91-211,
Attachment 4. Topics should flow chronologically if possible. Include human factors write-ups
related to maintenance/logistics personnel in this section.
7.10. AFSAS 4.5.2.1. Factors. The same formatting, i.e., “overview analysis and conclusion”
apply here.
7.11. AFSAS 4.5.2.2 Non-Factors. Worthy of Discussion. Utilize the same formatting, i.e.,
“overview analysis and conclusion”.
7.12. AFSAS 4.5.2.3. Non-Factors. A list of areas you considered but were not determined to
be worthy of discussion goes here. For example: Depot Management, Depot Quality Assurance,
Manning Level, Training, Supervision, JOAP/Chip Detector history, Electrical systems, Flight
Controls, Fuel System, Egress system, Anti-Skid/Braking System, Hydraulic system, Aircraft
Maintenance and Servicing, Aircraft History, Technical Data Usage, Maintenance Training,
Maintenance Supervision, etc.
7.13. AFSAS 4.6. Conclusion: Construct a brief conclusion paragraph.
7.14. AFSAS 5. Findings and Causes: Findings need to be logical, chronological and must
sustain the mishap sequence. Ensure that all findings and causes are supported by the
investigation and analysis section. Reference AFI 91-204, chapter 5:
   7.14.1. The Findings Test:
       7.14.1.1. Is the Finding necessary to sustain the mishap sequence?
       7.14.1.2. Is the Finding a single event or condition?
       7.14.1.3. Is the Finding specific enough without including supporting evidence?
       7.14.1.4. Does the Finding logically connect to the preceding finding? Read the last
       finding; ask "why"?
       7.14.1.5. Does the finding above answer the "why"? Continue for each finding.
       7.14.1.6. Is the Finding relevant or simply interesting to the reader?
   7.14.2. The Cause Test:
       7.14.2.1. Is the Causal Finding, in most cases, correctable by commanders, supervisors
       or individuals?
       7.14.2.2. Is the Causal Finding a clear and simple statement of a single condition or
       event?
       7.14.2.3. Is the Causal Finding in the active voice and does it follow the format: Who did
       what to whom/what and why?
AFRCPAM91-201 5 JANUARY 2012                                                                     19


       7.14.2.4. If the Causal Finding is an effect or an expected result of a previously identified
       cause, even though its inclusion sustains the mishap sequence, it is not causal.
   7.14.3. General Guidelines on Findings and Causes:
       7.14.3.1. Findings that sustained the mishap sequence, but were normal to the situation
       as it developed are not causal.
       7.14.3.2. A cause is a deficiency, which if corrected, eliminated, or avoided, would likely
       have prevented or mitigated the mishap damage or significant injury. The intent is to
       identify the point where corrective action is needed.
       7.14.3.3. Apply the reasonable person concept when determining a cause. If a person’s
       performance or judgment was reasonable considering the mishap circumstances, do not
       assign cause. It is not appropriate to expect extraordinary or uniquely superior
       performance in such cases. Human factors (physiological or psychological) may be
       causal even though they are reasonable. Similar rationale applies to lack of a system or
       procedure.
       7.14.3.4. Most findings are not causal. Some are effects or the expected result of a
       previously identified cause even though their inclusion sustains the sequence leading to
       the mishap. An engine flameout precipitated by a fuel boost pump failure is the expected
       result of the boost pump failure and is not causal. The boost pump failure may have been
       a result of an even earlier cause such as a bearing failure or technical order non-
       compliance.
       7.14.3.5. Environmental conditions such as a bird strike, lightning or high winds may be
       causal only if all reasonable avoidance and damage/injury mitigation actions were taken.
       An individual, group or organization is virtually always responsible for a failure.
       Publications or objects should almost never be found causal. Rather, the party responsible
       for ensuring the publications are correct or the party responsible for ensuring an object
       does not fail with catastrophic consequences is causal, unless the party took all
       reasonably expected actions. In such cases, there may be process or organizational
       failures, and appropriate parties may be identified as responsible for these failures.
       7.14.3.6. Occasionally, an investigator may not be able to conclusively determine a
       specific causal event. In these special cases, the investigator may choose to list two or
       three most probable causes for each option. In rare instances the causal event may be
       unknown.
7.15. AFSAS 6. Recommendations: A list of all of the SIB’s recommendations goes here.
Each recommendation needs to correspond to a finding. Reference AFI 91-204, chapter 5. If an
AF 847 or AFTO 22 was completed, place its tracking number next to the corresponding
recommendation
   7.15.1. Note: For each recommendation, AFSAS will require you to enter a deficiency and
   reference a finding.
7.16. AFSAS 7. Other Findings and Recommendations of Significance (OFS/ORS):
   7.16.1. Reference AFI 91-204, Chapter 5. Guidance for developing and documenting
   primary findings and recommendations applies similarly to OFSs and ORSs.
20                                                  AFRCPAM91-201 5 JANUARY 2012


  7.16.2. Other Findings of Significance (OFS) are findings that the safety investigators
  believe could contribute to future mishaps and/or warrant command attention, but were not
  part of the mishap sequence. OFS should be listed following the mishap recommendations in
  message and formal reports.
  7.16.3. Other Recommendations of Significance (ORS) are recommendations resulting from
  OFS. Each OFS will be followed by its corresponding ORS. Assign an OPR(s) to each ORS.
