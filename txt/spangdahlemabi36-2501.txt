SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This change incorporates Military Personnel Flight Manual (MPFM) 06-57, Senior Airman
(SrA) Below-the-Zone (BTZ) Promotion Program, and implements the use of AF Form 1206,
Nomination for Award, is now required for all Airmen First Class (A1C) being nominated for
BTZ consideration. The nomination will be no more than 15 lines in length (including sub-
bullet’s) not including headings. The AF Form 1206 will have the following headings:
 2                                             SPANGDAHLEMABI36-2501 8 MARCH 2011


Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duties, Training, Education, and Self Improvement
Efforts, and Other Accomplishments (Attachment 3). The board will not consider any previous
evaluations. The scoring system procedure is changed to reflect paragraph 7.1-7.1.3
(Attachments 4 and 5). Additionally, the instruction now prescribes Spangdahlem Form 1,
Individual Board Member’s Package Score Sheet, and Spangdahlem Form 2, Board President’s
Master Score Sheet. Note: The board president will use this form to consolidate overall scores
recorded by each of the board members on each of the nominees. Board presidents do not enter
their score unless a scoring tie occurs.
1. General.
     1.1. The purpose of this instruction is to provide instructions concerning Senior Airman
     BTZ. The BTZ program provides the opportunity for exceptionally well qualified A1C’s of
     a one-time consideration for promotion to SrA, to be effective 6 months prior to their normal
     promotion date. Airmen selected for these promotions should be those who are clearly
     headed for the top grades and jobs. These promotions are not intended merely as rewards for
     exceptional service in the grade of A1C.
2. Below the Zone Promotion Criteria.
     2.1. By the time of pin on member must have 30 months time-in-service (TIS) and 14
     months time-in-grade (TIG), or 22 months TIG, whichever occurs first (Attachment 2).
     Additionally, the member must meet primary Air Force Specialty Code skill level
     requirements (must possess a 3-skill level, unless waived according to AFI 36-2502), and be
     recommended by the commander on part I of the computerized BTZ nomination roster.
3. Responsibilities.
     3.1. The Promotions office (52 FSS/FSMPDP) identifies eligible members using the Military
     Personnel Section (MPS) computerized product, ensuring all eligible meet TIS and TIG
     requirements.
        3.1.1. MPS determines quotas for large and small units based on 15 percent of the
        eligible population using TIS and TIG requirements only. Members ineligible for
        promotion are not considered when determining the quotas. Computation: Eligible’s
        multiplied by 15 percent equals the quota

Figure 3.1. Computation sample
      Example: 13 eligible’s x 0.15 = 1.95, or 2 BTZ quotas
             (Note: Fractions of 0.5 or higher are rounded up)
      Distribution: Eligibles       Quota          Eligibles      Quota

      3.1.2. Determine the quota and obtain 52d Fighter Wing commander (52 FW/CC)
      approval before distribution to units. The 52 FW/CC has delegated approval authority to
      the Chief, MPS.
          3.1.2.1. Large units (7 or more eligible) receive quotas and promote at unit level.
          Small units (6 or less eligible) are combined into one pool of eligible’s to form the
          Central Base Board (CBB) population.
      3.1.3. The Promotions office distributes BTZ eligible rosters to units with a notification
      letter to include: date of CBB board, suspense for packages (small units), suspense board
      results letter and authorized quotas (large units). Units will be notified by letter if they
      are a large unit or small unit no later than the second week of the first processing month
      (Jan, Apr, Jul, and Oct) prior to that quarter’s selection.
4. Selection Requirements.
   4.1. To ensure fair, equitable, and timely BTZ consideration, units will consider all
   individuals meeting TIG and TIS requirements regardless if a member is on temporary duty
   (TDY), on leave, or has departed permanent change of station (PCS) during or subsequent to
   the processing months for that quarter’s selections.
      4.1.1. All individuals appearing on the eligibility roster must be considered. This does
      not mean all eligible personnel will be nominated to the board.
      4.1.2. Commanders will review member’s personnel records, Personnel Information File,
      Current Fitness test score, and discuss the consideration with the supervisor and First
      Sergeant to ensure members are exceptionally well qualified before making a decision to
      nominate or not to nominate.
      4.1.3. Part II of the listing contains questionable eligibles and Part III contains
      ineligibles. Individuals listed on Part II or Part III are individuals with quality force
      indicators such as rating of 2 or less on the last Enlisted Performance Report, unfavorable
      information file, etc. Individuals listed on Part III are ineligible for promotion IAW AFI
      36-2502, and are not computed in the overall unit’s number of eligibles when
      determining the quota.
      4.1.4. Alternates are selected in the event a selectee is removed by the commander prior
      to the effective date of promotion. Alternates will receive the original BTZ date of rank
      and the effective date will be the date of commander approval. MPS will assist the
      member with applying for a retroactive promotion effective date to Headquarters Air
      Force Personnel Center Enlisted Promotions in accordance with AFI 36-2502.
      4.1.5. If an individual should have been considered during the current quarter board and
      the error is discovered before promotion selections are announced, large unit
      commanders will consider the Airman and adjust selections accordingly. The CBB will
      reconvene to consider small unit eligibles and selections will be adjusted accordingly. If
      discovered after selections are announced, supplemental promotion consideration
      procedures may apply.
      4.1.6. When a commander has promotion authority over two or more units, the eligible
      members are combined and the commander complies with established large or small unit
      procedures.
