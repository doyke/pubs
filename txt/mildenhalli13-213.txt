                              GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. The goal of the airfield driving program is to create a safe airfield environment. Safe
   operation of motor vehicles on the airfield is essential to normal aircraft operations and
   maintenance. Motor vehicles present a clear and definite danger, both to aircraft and ground
   personnel. Carelessness, haste, and a disregard for established safety standards are the
   primary sources of aircraft or vehicle collisions, incidents, and personnel injury with motor
   vehicles on the airfield.
   1.1.2. The standards set in this instruction are to control airfield vehicle operations and must
   be used in conjunction with Mildenhall Instruction (MILDI) 13-204, Airfield and Air Traffic
   Control Operations.
   1.1.3. Only trained personnel will be assigned duties that require driving on the airfield.
   Airfield experience is not a substitute for completion of local airfield driving training and
   testing requirements. Trained personnel must be knowledgeable of and comply with this
   instruction. The use of vehicles and the number of authorized drivers on the airfield will be
   limited to the absolute minimum necessary to accomplish the mission.
   1.1.4. Unit commanders, Airfield Driving Program Managers (ADPM) and Airfield
   Management (AM) personnel have the authority to revoke airfield driving privileges.
   1.1.5. All personnel on the airfield are responsible for monitoring airfield vehicle safety,
   detecting unauthorized vehicles, and immediately reporting airfield driving violations to
   Airfield Management Operations (AM Ops).
      1.1.5.1. If necessary, AM will notify the Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC). The
      BDOC will dispatch a patrol and assist AM in apprehending violators and issuing
      citations if appropriate.
      1.1.5.2. AM will investigate all airfield driving violations and take appropriate action per
      AFI 13-213.
1.2. 100th Air Refueling Wing Commander
   1.2.1. Designates personnel and agencies to support the Airfield Driving Program.
   1.2.2. Holds the authority to reinstate airfield driving privileges, in writing, to perform
   mission essential duties following suspension or revocation of base driving privileges.
   Authority must not be delegated.
   1.2.3. Approves this instruction.
1.3. 100th Operations Group Commander
   1.3.1. Implements and chairs a Runway Incursion Prevention Working Group (RIPWG) if
   there are more than two runway incursions within a six month period.
      1.3.1.1. The RIPWG will consist of the 100 OSS/CC, AOF/CC, Airfield Manager
      (AFM), Wing ADPM, Tower Chief Controller, Wing Safety, Unit Commanders and/or
 6                                                        MILDENHALLI13-213 5 JULY 2013


        Unit ADPMs. Failure to attend a RIPWG will result in the unit’s airfield driving training
        program being suspended until the DAFM can conduct a SAV.
        1.3.1.2. The RIPWG will:
            1.3.1.2.1. Analyze runway incursions and corrective actions.
            1.3.1.2.2. Evaluate airfield driving operating procedures/standards and airfield
            configuration to determine if corrective actions are needed.
            1.3.1.2.3. Develop strategies to prevent the reoccurrence of runway incursions.
1.4. Unit Commanders.
     1.4.1. Limits the number of personnel authorized to drive on the airfield to the absolute
     minimum necessary to accomplish the mission.
     1.4.2. Certifies personnel are qualified to drive on the airfield. This may be delegated in
     writing to the Unit ADPM.
     1.4.3. Appoints a primary and alternate ADPM. Forwards a copy of the appointment letter
     to the Deputy Airfield Manager, 100 OSS/OSAA.
     1.4.4. Unit ADPMs must be at least a SSgt/E-5 or civilian equivalent with six months time
     on station with a AF IMT 483 certified for airfield driving. Waiver authority is delegated to
     the appropriate Group Commander or equivalent. Authority may not be delegated.
     1.4.5. Through the ADPM, establish a training program designed to meet the needs of the
     units.
     1.4.6. Ensure training is conducted for all personnel who drive on the airfield and certify
     personnel who are qualified in the Airfield Driving database. This authority may be
     delegated to the ADPM. If delegated, include on the ADPM appointment letter.
     1.4.7. If a unit member loses base driving privileges or has their civil driver’s license
     suspended or revoked, their airfield driver’s license will also be suspended or revoked. The
     unit’s ADPM will notify the wing ADPM in writing.                         Documentation of

2.1. General.
   2.1.1. All personnel driving/working on the airfield must receive training, briefing or an
   escort prior to entry to the airfield. Sponsoring agency will provide an airfield qualified
   escort for personnel working on the airfield. Personnel acting as an escort must be
   authorized and certified to drive on the airfield.
   2.1.2. AM does not provide airfield escorts for personnel requiring access to the airfield. If
   escorts are required, the agency sponsoring the individuals or event is required to provide
   qualified escorts. The owning/using agency must maintain positive control of all contractors
   working on or near the airfield.
2.2. Airfield Driver’s Training.
   2.2.1. Airfield driver training and certification requirements are listed in Step 2 of the online
   database. (AFI 13-213, Attachment 5, will be utilized to document training when airfield
   driver’s training must be accomplished manually.)
       2.2.1.1. The unit ADPM is responsible for providing the airfield driving website link to
       new trainees for initial entry into the database. Step 1 is completed by the trainee. Any
       restriction imposed on a trainee’s civil license must be complied with while operating on
       the airfield.
       2.2.1.2. The qualified unit trainer is responsible for completing Step 2 with the trainee.
       Upon completion of Step 2, the trainee will be moved into Step 3 to complete the unit
       test. The unit test is enabled by the unit ADPM. After passing the unit test the trainee
       will be placed in Step 4 to take the wing test, and will temporarily drop from the unit’s
       list of trainees. The wing test is enabled by one of the Wing ADPMs from the AM
       section. When all training is complete and the trainee has their airfield driver’s license,
       he or she will then appear in the unit’s list of qualified drivers.
       2.2.1.3. If training and award of AF IMT 483 is accomplished manually (on paper), the
       Unit ADPM will keep all training documentation in the Unit ADPM binder. The Unit
       ADPM will then input the licensee into the airfield driving as an “existing licensee”. The
       system will then track the licensee for refresher training and the Unit ADPM will be able
       to print out the license.
   2.2.2. The following training and tests are required for certification:
       2.2.2.1. Color Vision. See paragraph 2.3.
       2.2.2.2. Light Gun Signal Recognition Test. Practical training for light signals and
       required actions will be accomplished using AFVA 11-240, Airport Signs and Markings.
       During practical drivers training, the trainer shall request a light gun signal test with the
       ATCT so the trainee can visually see what the signals look like.
       2.2.2.3. Airfield Driving Computer Based Training (CBT). A short-cut to the driving
       CBT is located on the RAF Mildenhall AF Portal page under the Training tab. Follow the
MILDENHALLI13-213 5 JULY 2013                                                                  13


     links to Mildenhall Training Site and then to Airfield Training. Personnel must complete
     the CBT with a minimum passing score of 80%. If a person fails the exam, the CBT
     locks them from retesting for 24 hours. Once a passing score is obtained, it will be
     automatically posted to the online database. Unit ADPMs will keep a copy of the CBT
     completion certificate in their ADPM binder.
     2.2.2.4. Airfield Drivers Training (Classroom). All trainees must review MILDI 13-204
     and this instruction. Training must cover vehicle operating principles as well as local
     airfield layout. Trainees must be familiarized with aircraft marshaling signals listed in
     AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground. Ensure special attention
     is placed on CMA markings and procedures. Trainees must be familiar with operating
     procedures in this instruction before conducting day or night orientation training.
     2.2.2.5. Day Airfield Orientation Training (Practical). As a minimum, day orientation
     training must include practical driving on the airfield. In addition to general procedures
     in this instruction, emphasis will be placed on minimum requirements for practical
     airfield driver’s training IAW AFI 13-213, 3.2.3.5.. Ensure the markings used to define
     the boundaries of the CMA (markings and signs) are emphasized. Also ensure proper
     radio phraseology is trained.
     2.2.2.6. Night Airfield Orientation Training (Practical). As a minimum, night orientation
     training must include practical driving on the airfield during the hours of darkness. In
     addition to general procedures in this instruction, emphasis should be placed on airfield
     lighting and signs used to augment daytime airfield markings. NOTE: Continue to
     emphasize the boundaries of the CMA and proper radio phraseology.
     2.2.2.7. Airfield Drivers Test (Practical). Regardless of the hours trained during day and
     night practical training, this check ride should not be accomplished until the trainee is
     confident in their airfield driving abilities. Trainees must be able to demonstrate proper
     driving techniques and answer verbal questions regarding general airfield driving
     procedures proscribed in this instruction and the minimum practical driving test
     requirements outlined in AFI 13-213, 3.2.4.3.4.
     2.2.2.8. Wing Airfield Drivers Test (Electronic or Written). A wing ADPM will
     administer the online (Step 4) or written test required for final certification. The test
     consists of questions regarding operating procedures per this instruction, such as proper
     radio communication, general knowledge, and a separate runway incursion prevention
     test; the test also includes a diagram of the airfield in which the trainee must demonstrate
     the ability to locate the different taxiways, aprons, perimeter road, airfield access points
     and restricted areas, and each end of Runway 11/29 (as a minimum). Minimum passing
     score for the general knowledge test is 80%. The minimum passing score for the
     communication, runway incursion, and the diagram test is 100% (an incorrect answer to
     such questions in the airfield driving database test will result in an automatic failure). In
     addition to the test, the ADPM must conduct a unit specific individual phraseology test
     simulating radio contact with the ATCT with those individuals who operate vehicles
     within the CMA.
  2.2.3. Unit ADPM must ensure annual refresher training is conducted for all personnel
  issued an AF IMT 483. As a minimum, refresher training will include reviewing this
  instruction, MILDI 13-204, and completing the airfield driving CBT and online runway

   incursion prevention test through the airfield driving website. Airfield Driving program
   managers will ensure all refresher items are completed and have their drivers print a new AF
   IMT 483 with the updated information; if drivers are not online, then the unit ADPM must
   annotate refresher training completion on the reverse side of the member's AF IMT 483 and
   update unit master list of drivers.
   2.2.4. Unit ADPM will suspend airfield driving privileges for those who do not complete
   refresher training on the first day of the preceding month after the refresher training was due.
   All qualified airfield drivers who have been deployed or TDY and/or have not driven on the
   RAF Mildenhall airfield within six months must re-accomplish annual refresher training to
   include a day and night orientation and a review of the current MILDI 13-213 prior to driving
   on the RAF Mildenhall airfield. The unit ADPM will annotate completion of this
   requirement on the AF IMT 483 on the airfield driving website.
2.3. Color Vision Requirements.
   2.3.1. Personnel must have the color vision ability to distinguish between red, green, white,
   yellow, and blue to drive within the CMA and receive an unrestricted AF IMT 483.
   2.3.2. Personnel awarded AFSCs which have already had color vision requirements verified,
   do not require additional color blindness screening. Unit ADPMs shall validate all trainees
   meeting this standard with the AFSCs listed in Attachment 5.
   2.3.3. For civilian employees whose duties include airfield driving, color vision
   requirements must be included as a requirement for employment.
   2.3.4. Personnel that are not awarded an AFSC with color vision requirements already
   verified must report to the 48 MDG for color vision testing. Document results in online
   database or Attachment 5 of AFI 13-213. Individuals who fail color vision requirements will
   not be granted access to the CMA.
2.4. AF IMT 483 Issuance
   2.4.1. The AFM, Wing ADPM, and other designated AM representatives are responsible for
   signing AF IMT 483s. All base assigned personnel (e.g. military, DoD civilian, Contractor,
   etc.) required to operate a vehicle on the airfield, must complete all airfield drivers’ training
   and testing requirements outlined in this ADI and AFI 13-213 prior to issuance of an AF IMT
   483. NOTE: An AFSC or career field training (e.g. aircraft maintenance, aircrew, fire and
   emergency services, security forces, transportation, etc.) is not a substitute for completion of
   airfield driving training and testing requirements outlined in this ADI.
   2.4.2. The unit ADPM ensures unit personnel complete airfield driver training and
   certification prior to issuance of an AF IMT 483. (See Attachment 5)

                                           Chapter 3

                    AIRFIELD MARKINGS, LIGHTING AND SIGNS

3.1. General.
   3.1.1. Airfield markings, lights and signs are used to direct and control the movement of
   aircraft and vehicles on the ground. All personnel involved with driving on the airfield must
   be familiar with airfield markings, lights and signs to prevent aircraft impediments and
   runway incursions.
3.2. Runway Markings.
   3.2.1. The runway edge is marked with solid white lines running the length of the runway.
   The centerline is marked with a dashed white line running down the middle of the length of
   the runway. White numerals (11 and 29) at the ends of each runway mark the designation.
3.3. Runway Lights.
   3.3.1. The runway edge is marked with white and amber lights. These high intensity lights
   run the length of the runway and identify the runway edge. White lights also mark the
   runway centerline.
3.4. Runway Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Hold Position Markings.
   3.4.1. Four parallel yellow stripes that extend across the entire width of a taxiway, 180’ from
   the edge of the runway. The two lines closest to the runway are dashed and the other two are
   solid. This marking identifies the boundary of the CMA. No vehicle will pass this marking
   without ATCT approval. See Attachment 3.

Figure 3.1. VFR Hold Position Marking.




3.5. Runway VFR Hold Position Guard (Wig-Wag) Lights.
   3.5.1. Runway guard lights, commonly referred to as “Wig-Wag” lights, are a pair of
   elevated flashing yellow lights installed on either side of the VFR hold position marking.
   Their primary purpose is to enhance runway/taxiway intersections during low visibility
   conditions. See Figure 3.2.
3.6. Runway VFR Hold Position Signs.
   3.6.1. VFR hold position signs have white inscriptions on a red background. They are
   located on the left side or both sides of a taxiway, adjacent to the VFR runway hold position
   marking. This sign indicates the boundary of the CMA and helps drivers identify the CMA
   at night or when the taxiway is covered with snow.
 20                                                     MILDENHALLI13-213 5 JULY 2013


   3.6.2. Hold position signs are Mandatory Signs. Mandatory signs are provided when an
   aircraft or vehicle must follow an instruction. No vehicle will pass these signs without
   ATCT approval. See Attachment 3.

Figure 3.2. VFR Hold Position Sign with Wig-Wag light.




3.7. Runway Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Hold Position Markings.
   3.7.1. Two solid parallel yellow stripes with double vertical stripes spaced two feet apart.
   The space between pairs is ten feet and all stripes are one foot wide. The designation for the
   instrument holding position “INST” is painted on the runway side of the line to be read
   facing the runway.
   3.7.2. This marking is used to prevent aircraft and vehicles from interfering with the
   Instrument Landing System (ILS) signal transmitted to an aircraft on final approach. During
   inclement weather or when visibility is restricted, vehicle operators will not cross the
   instrument hold line without ATCT approval.
   3.7.3. There are two IFR hold position markings. One is located on Taxiway Alpha by the
   Runway 29 end hammerhead and another is located on the Taxiway Bravo on the Runway 11
   end hammerhead. See Attachment 3.

Figure 3.3. IFR Hold Position Marking.




3.8. Runway IFR Hold Position Stop/Go Wig-Wag Lights.
   3.8.1. These lights are a “Wig-Wag” fixture modified to a red and green light controlled by
   the tower. When the lights are green, vehicles may pass the IFR hold position marking and
   proceed up to but not past the VFR hold position marking. When the light is red, vehicles
   will not proceed beyond the IFR hold position marking until the light returns to green. See
   Attachment 3.
MILDENHALLI13-213 5 JULY 2013                                                                  21


3.9. Runway IFR Hold Position Signs.
   3.9.1. IFR hold position signs have the word ILS inscribed in white letters on a red
   background. They are located on the left side of a taxiway, adjacent to the IFR runway hold
   position marking.

Figure 3.4. IFR Hold Position Sign and Stop/Go Wig-Wag Light.




3.10. Perimeter Road Traffic Lights.
   3.10.1. In addition to taxiways, portions of perimeter road and airfield access roads on both
   the east and west ends of the airfield fall within ILS signal areas that must be protected from
   vehicle traffic when an aircraft is on an ILS approach. When the ATCT activates the red
   lights, vehicles must stop at marked locations until the light returns to green.

Figure 3.5. Perimeter Road Traffic Lights.




3.11. Taxiway, Taxilane and Apron Markings.
   3.11.1. Taxiway centerlines are marked with a continuous yellow line. A taxilane is a taxi
   path on an apron and is also marked with a continuous yellow line. These centerlines are
   used to indicate the taxi path of an aircraft.
   3.11.2. Taxiway edges are marked with continuous double yellow lines. The marking
   indicates the edge of the usable taxiway surface from other surfaces not intended for use by
   aircraft.
   3.11.3. Taxilane edges are marked with 15 foot long double yellow lines with 25’ gaps
   between them and are used to define the limits of a designated taxi route where the
   surrounding pavement is intended for use by aircraft. Aircraft movement across the
   designated boundary is permitted either by direction of ATCT, a marshaled or at the pilot's
   discretion.
3.12. Taxiway and Apron Lights.
   3.12.1. Taxiway and apron edges are marked with blue lights.
 22                                                      MILDENHALLI13-213 5 JULY 2013


3.13. Taxiway Signs.
   3.13.1. Taxiway signs are Informational Signs that indicate either a current location or a
   direction of travel. Location signs have yellow inscriptions on a black background.
   Directional signs have black inscriptions normally accompanied with a directional arrow on
   yellow backgrounds.

Figure 3.6. Taxiway Information Sign.




3.14. Wing Tip Lines
   3.14.1. White solid lines across hardstands. These markings identify the minimum distance
   vehicles and equipment can be positioned to facilitate the safe passage of towed or taxiing
   aircraft on adjacent taxiways or taxilanes.

Figure 3.7. Wing Tip Lines.




3.15. Closed Pavement Markings.
   3.15.1. Airfield pavements previously used for aircraft operations that are closed to aircraft
   traffic are marked with a yellow 30’ long capital “X”. Some of these areas on the airfield are
   degraded. Vehicles may still use these paved areas but will conduct FOD checks prior to
   reentering operational airfield pavements.
3.16. Vehicle Lane Markings.
   3.16.1. Some areas of the airfield have vehicle lanes marked with white lines. Airfield
   access roads, roads within the airfield interior, and barrier access roads leading to the runway
   all have white stop-bar markings. The stopping distances ensure taxiways have required
   wing tip clearance. The stop-bars on barrier access roads are in line with CMA hold position
   markings.
MILDENHALLI13-213 5 JULY 2013                                                                    23


3.17. FOD Check Point Signs.
   3.17.1. All access roads to the airfield have FOD check signs to remind personnel of
   mandatory FOD check requirements before entering the airfield if vehicle has been driven off
   a paved surface.

Figure 3.8. FOD Check Point Signs.




3.18. South Perimeter Road Taxiway Crossings.
   3.18.1. Two portions of south perimeter road cross Taxiway Bravo. POVs without a airfield
   POV pass are authorized to cross Taxiway Bravo at the designated points. No POV will use
   a crossing point as a short-cut to any facility. Crossing will only take place when no other
   route is possible or accessible.
   3.18.2. Only the two crossing points designated on Attachment 3 may be used. Vehicles will
   stop at designated stop locations and perform a FOD check (if it has been driven off a paved
   surface) before crossing. Aircraft have the right-of-way at all times. No vehicle will cross
   the taxiway if an aircraft is taxiing towards the crossing point, regardless of distance from the
   point. Additionally, vehicles traveling on the taxiway have priority over vehicles at the
   crossing points. Crossing points are:
      3.18.2.1. North of Hardstand 35 and 37 for access buildings 705, 707 and 719.
      3.18.2.2. West of building 802 and east of building 775.

3.19. South Perimeter Road and Taxiway Bravo
   3.19.1. A portion of south perimeter road is in close proximity to Taxiway Bravo. All
   vehicles operating on perimeter road must stop at one of the two designated locations and
   remain at the stop location if any aircraft is taxiing towards the area or is being towed
   through the area. Vehicles will remain at the stop location until the aircraft has departed the
   area.

                                  VEHICLE OPERATIONS

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Using the airfield for convenience is prohibited. Do not use the airfield as a short cut
   when there are accessible roads off the airfield.
   4.1.2. Runway crossings are restricted to mission essential operations only. When crossing
   the runway is required during flying operations, the preferred crossing point is the departure
   end. No vehicle will cross the runway when perimeter road could be used. The perimeter
   road is designated as the primary means for all traffic to gain access to facilities on the north
   and south side of the runway.
   4.1.3. No vehicle will enter the CMA without approval from the ATCT. Pedestrians (on-
   foot) are prohibited from entering the CMA unless in the performance of official duties and
   in two-way radio contact with the ATCT. See Chapter 5 for CMA procedures. Any other
   pedestrian access to the airfield must be for official business in support of the flying mission
   and limited to direct routes to and from the aircraft parking spots. Always walk in the
   direction of traffic and never stop to sit in areas where aircraft or vehicles move through.
   4.1.4. All vehicles operating on the airfield must have an airfield diagram, AFVA 11-240
   signal decal, and AFVA 13-222. Units may order decals via USAF e-publishing web site.
   The decal may be permanently affixed in plain view of the driver or clipped to the inside of
   the sun visor on the driver's side of the vehicle so it can be flipped down for ready reference.
   4.1.5. All vehicles will stop prior to entering the airfield or crossing a taxiway and determine
   visually, the way is clear before proceeding. Aircraft have the right-of-way at all times.
   Vehicles will never overtake or pass a taxiing/towing aircraft.
   4.1.6. All vehicle drivers and pedestrians operating in the CMA must use a distinct call-sign
   to avoid duplicating or confusing similar names. A list of approved call-signs is included in
   Attachment 2 of this instruction. Additional call-signs may be approved with coordination
   with the DAFM.
   4.1.7. Much of Taxiway Bravo, west of Taxiway Charlie are blind spots and not visible from
   the ATCT. Vehicles must use increased vigilance in these areas to ensure they remain clear
   of taxiing/towing aircraft.
   4.1.8. With the exception of a Transient Alert "Follow Me" vehicle, no vehicle will be
   driven into the path of a taxiing aircraft. Never drive a vehicle between a “Follow Me”
   vehicle and an aircraft, a marshaller and an aircraft, or a fire truck and an aircraft when the
   fire truck has its emergency lights on. It is common for a marshaller to stand on the opposite
   side of the taxiway reference the parking location. Operators found in violation of this
   paragraph are subject to an immediate suspension IAW Chapter 6.
   4.1.9. When driving on the airfield, drivers will follow the basic "rules of the road".
   Random travel on the airfield is not authorized. Vehicles traveling on taxiways and aprons
   will not drive on center/taxi lines unless performing official duties. Vehicles will drive along
   the taxiway or apron edge and then turn 90 degrees to cross.
 26                                                      MILDENHALLI13-213 5 JULY 2013


   4.1.10. No vehicle will be driven within 50’ of any fueling/defueling operation unless
   specifically authorized by a directive. Vehicles and equipment will not be driven or towed
   over in-ground fuel pit covers located on parking aprons.
   4.1.11. Helicopters may operate (hover) on taxiways. It is important airfield drivers look
   "up" as much "out" when driving in helicopter operating areas. Drivers must be familiar
   with designated helicopter operating areas prescribed in MILDI 13-204.
   4.1.12. Any disabled vehicle on the airfield will be immediately reported to AM Ops or the
   ATCT. The driver will remain with the vehicle and use every means possible to alert taxiing
   aircraft. Driver will establish contact with an applicable control center and the owning unit
   must coordinate vehicle removal. At a minimum, the operator of the disabled vehicle will:
       4.1.12.1. Leave the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers on.
       4.1.12.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, make the following transmission:
       “All parties BREAK, BREAK-This is (call sign) with an emergency for Airfield
       Management, Tower, and Maintenance Operations Center.” State the nature of the
       problem and report your position on the airfield.
   4.1.13. Airfield surfaces will not be used for recreational walking or running. Unit formation
   runs may be coordinated with AM and must be approved by 100 OG/CC.
4.2. Airfield Authorized Vehicles.
   4.2.1. GOVs performing official, mission essential duties.
   4.2.2. POVs, GLVs, and contractor vehicles with a valid POV pass and in the performance
   of official duties, or being escorted by an authorized vehicle.
   4.2.3. Unit-owned golf-cart type or similar utility vehicles (electric or gas) are authorized on
   taxiways and aprons only. Drivers must be airfield driving qualified. To be used at night or
   during periods of restricted visibility, they must be equipped with headlights and taillights
   visible from 200’, 30 minutes before sunset to 30 minutes after sunrise.
   4.2.4. Bicycle usage. Bicycles are to be used on the airfield while conducting official
   business only. Recreational bicycling is prohibited on any portion of the airfield. The
   airfield shall not be used when traveling to and from work or as a shortcut. Bicycles
   operating on the airfield will follow the same FOD procedures as all other vehicles IAW
   paragraph 4.11. Night operation requires an operational headlamp and reflectors or reflective
   tape. Tricycles must have a suitable braking device engaged when parked on the airfield.
       4.2.4.1. Unit-owned bicycles are authorized on taxiways and aprons only. Riders must
       be airfield driving qualified and wear required individual protective equipment (IPE).
       Unit-owned bicycles must be marked for unit identification purposes.

       resume normal speed limits.
4.6. Vehicle Lighting.
   4.6.1. All vehicles on the airfield will use headlights during hours of darkness or reduced
   visibility. To preserve an aircrew's night vision, vehicle headlights will never be shined
   towards a taxiing aircraft. When a taxiing aircraft is encountered, the vehicle will stop and
   headlights will be turned off. Parking lights or emergency flashers will be turned on.
   Headlights will remain off until the aircraft has cleared, then turned back on before the
   vehicle is put in motion.
   4.6.2. Golf-cart type vehicles not equipped with parking lights must position their vehicles to
   prevent headlights from being directed toward a taxiing aircraft.
   4.6.3. Drivers of vehicles equipped with daytime running lights (DRL) must be aware of the
   system’s operating procedures. Normally, to turn the head lights off, a vehicle must stop,
   shift transmission into park, and apply the parking break to turn the DRL off while other
   parking/emergency flasher lights function normally. If this procedure does not work, vehicle
   must be stopped in a direction that does not direct headlights towards a taxiing aircraft.
MILDENHALLI13-213 5 JULY 2013                                                                  29

   4.9.4. Vehicles and wheeled equipment that do not have an integral braking system will have
   one rear wheel chocked, both front and back of the tire, while parked on an apron. Vehicles
   will be parked so they can leave without having to back up.
   4.9.5. Vehicles will be parked with the drivers' side towards the aircraft and never pointed
   towards an aircraft. Vehicles parked at the sides of an aircraft must be located clear of the
   wingtips and be clearly visible from the cockpit.
   4.9.6. Vehicles will not be parked closer than 25’ from an aircraft at any time. Vehicles will
   not be parked closer than 200’ (300’ for large aircraft) to the rear of an aircraft whose
   engines are being started or are operating at any time. When operating at above idle settings,
   increase distance to at least 800’.
4.10. Airfield Obstructions.
   4.10.1. Vehicles, Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE), Materials Handling Equipment
   (MHE), etc., are all categorized as mobile obstructions. Vehicles will not be parked or

4.11. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention and Control.
   4.11.1. All vehicles entering the airfield or crossing an airfield surface must stop and
   perform a roll over FOD check if their vehicle has driven off any paved surface. If you
   cannot determine its status, a FOD check should be conducted. Checks will include tires,
   wheel wells, fenders, and truck beds. Vehicles equipped with towable magnets will be
   checked and all debris removed from the magnets. FOD checks during hours of darkness
   must be performed with a flashlight.
MILDENHALLI13-213 5 JULY 2013                                                                       31


   4.11.2. All GOV tires must be checked during the daily vehicle inspection, per AF Form
   1800, Operators Inspection Guide, Item 8. During this vehicle inspection, any foreign
   materials will be removed from the tires of vehicles used for airfield operations.
   4.11.3. During winter conditions snow and icy conditions may cause accumulation on
   vehicles. Anytime these conditions are present, FOD checks are mandatory, to include
   removal of snow and ice from vehicle tops, bumpers, and wheel wells.
   4.11.4. Vehicles will be operated on hard surfaces to the maximum extent possible. If
   operation on an unpaved surface is absolutely necessary, drivers will check tires immediately
   after returning to paved surfaces as required in paragraph 4.11.1. If the pavement area
   requires cleaning after returning to the pavement (i.e., mud), the vehicle operator will ensure
   a sweeper is requested through AM Ops.
   4.11.5. Vehicle operators encountering small amounts of FOD will stop and secure the FOD.
   Large amounts of debris will immediately be reported to AM Ops, who will dispatch a
   sweeper.
   4.11.6. Hats will not be worn on the airfield due to aircraft intake hazard areas. If a hat is

                                           Chapter 5

           CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREA AND RADIO PROCEDURES

5.1. Controlled Movement Area (CMA).
   5.1.1. The CMA includes the runway, both overruns and 180’ of all areas adjacent to the
   runway and overruns edges. See Attachment 3. Access to the CMA is limited to mission
   essential operations only.
   5.1.2. All vehicles or personnel must establish two-way radio contact with the ATCT and
   receive approval from the ATCT before entering any portion of the CMA.
   5.1.3. The VFR hold lines indicate the boundary of the CMA on all taxiways leading to the
   runway. Barrier access roads have white stop bars by the shelters to indicate the boundary.
   Vehicles or personnel working on the infield areas of the airfield will use the barrier shacks
   as a visual reference to determine the edge of the CMA boundary.
   5.1.4. Though not part of the CMA, personnel working on the Runway 11 or 29 ILS
   Localizer shelters must establish and maintain contact with the ATCT prior to entering the
   area.
   5.1.5. In certain situations, the ATCT may grant access to the CMA but limit the areas that
   may be accessed. EXAMPLE: Grass mowing equipment may receive approval within the
   CMA but told to hold short of the runway; often referred to as "...approved up to but not on
   the runway...". Barrier Maintenance personnel may be approved in barrier shacks but told to
   hold short of the runway. In these situations, it is imperative the drivers fully understand and
   acknowledge ATCTs instructions.
   5.1.6. Anytime the ATCT directs vehicles or personnel to exit the CMA, they will depart the
   CMA by the most direct route (by any accessible route) and fall back to a position outside of
   the CMA boundary.
   5.1.7. Vehicles that normally operate within the CMA must use high beams and rotation
   beacon lights. Vehicles not equipped with beacon lights must use emergency flashers.
   Vehicles will turn lights on prior to contacting the ATCT and requesting access onto the
   CMA. Upon exiting the CMA, vehicles will leave the lights on until the ATCT has
   acknowledged they are off the CMA.
   5.1.8. Taxiways (except for areas on the runway side of VFR hold lines) and parking aprons
   are not part of the CMA. Radio contact with the ATCT is not required in these areas.
5.2. Convoy or Escort Procedures.
   5.2.1. Personnel acting as escorts must be authorized and certified to drive on the airfield
   and be fully aware of associated responsibilities. Escorts must brief all drivers on route,
   speed and procedures.
   5.2.2. The number of vehicles in a convoy must be limited to the minimum required to
   accomplish the mission and will not exceed five vehicles. The convoy must maintain close
   intervals when crossing the CMA. The convoy escort must be in the lead vehicle and is
   responsible for all communications with the ATCT.
 34                                                      MILDENHALLI13-213 5 JULY 2013


   5.2.3. Lead vehicle will contact the ATCT and advise them of how many vehicles are in the
   convoy; i.e., "...AMC convoy plus three..." means a total of four vehicles. The lead vehicle
   will not enter the CMA until the ATCT approves and will not call off the CMA until the last
   vehicle has crossed the CMA boundary.
5.3. Radio Procedures.
   5.3.1. Vehicles and personnel will contact the ATCT via the base land mobile radio Ground
   net, call sign “Mildenhall Ground.” Access to any portion of the CMA requires Mildenhall
   Ground approval. Radio must be monitored and contact with Mildenhall Ground maintained
   the entire time a vehicle or person is within the CMA.
   5.3.2. If radio contact is lost, the ATCT will flash runway lights on and off or use light-gun
   signals to direct the vehicle to exit the CMA. If a vehicle has a radio failure, they will depart
   the CMA immediately and then contact the ATCT as soon as possible to report they are off
   the CMA.
   5.3.3. Vehicles will only use approved call signs described in Attachment 2. AM may
   approve other temporary call signs in coordination with the ATCT on a case-by-case basis.
5.4. Radio Phraseology.
   5.4.1. To eliminate miscommunications and possibly compromising safety, it is imperative
   proper phraseology be adhered to. Radio transmissions are monitored (and recorded) by AM
   and the ATCT at all times. Violating radio phraseology requirements can result in loss of
   driving privileges.
   5.4.2. All radio communications will be kept to the minimum required to accomplish the
   mission. Use the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) pronunciation for
   individual letters and/or numbers included in radio transmissions per Attachment 5.
   5.4.3. The words "clear", “cleared”, or “clearance” must not be used by personnel or vehicle
   operators in the CMA on any radio or in communication with ATCT. EXCEPTION:
   Vehicle operators may reply “Loud and Clear” in response to an ATCT request for radio
   transmission quality or clarity.
   5.4.4. The only word that authorizes access to the CMA is PROCEED. ON is the proper
   term for entering the CMA. OFF is the proper term for exiting the CMA. HOLD-SHORT
   means disapproval of a request and do not enter the CMA. CROSS or ACROSS only
   authorizes a vehicle to cross the CMA. If approved to cross, do not stop within the CMA
   without further ATCT permission.
   5.4.5. It is mandatory all HOLD-SHORT or PROCEED instructions issued by Ground are
   acknowledged by reading back the instructions to Ground verbatim. A vehicle will not enter
   the CMA until instructions issued by Ground are read back. Vehicle operators must listen
   carefully and repeat Ground instructions as they understand them.
   5.4.6. Always ensure radios are keyed prior to beginning the transmission to prevent parts of
   the communications be cut-off. Also ensure the radio mike does not have wind blowing into
   it while transmitting.
   5.4.7. Normal communication sequence:
      5.4.7.1. Call Sign of station being called (who you are calling).
MILDENHALLI13-213 5 JULY 2013                                                                    35


      5.4.7.2. Your Call Sign (who you are).
      5.4.7.3. Your Location (where you are).
      5.4.7.4. Your Request (what you want to do).

                                 VIOLATION PROCEDURES

6.1. General.
   6.1.1. All personnel operating on the airfield are responsible for identifying airfield driving
   violations. Report all violations to AM Ops and Security Forces immediately. Some airfield
   driving violations also violate MILDI 31-204 traffic rules and can result in a citation issued
   by Security Forces.
   6.1.2. Unit commanders, unit ADPMs, SFS, and AM personnel have authority to suspend
   and revoke airfield driving privileges (AF IMT 483). Commanders and ADPMs may only
   revoke privileges for personnel assigned to their unit. If AM revokes privileges, the DAFM
   must notify the unit commander and ADPM. If a unit revokes privileges, the unit must notify
   the DAFM.
6.2. CMA Violations.
   6.2.1. A CMA violation is entering the CMA without authorization from the ATCT. A
   runway incursion is entering the runway without authorization and is the most serious CMA
   violation. Runway incursions can result in loss of life and aircraft.
   6.2.2. All CMA violations must be immediately reported to AM. The DAFM will notify the
   AOF/CC, 100 OSS/CC, 100 OG/CC, Wing Safety and applicable unit commander and
   ADPM. AM will take immediate action to correct a problem or apply interim control
   measures to prevent CMA violations.
   6.2.3. A CMA violation that adversely impacts flight operations must be submitted to Wing
   Safety on an AF IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report, within 24-hours of the violation,
   and completed IAW AFI 13-213, 3.2.8.3.2.6. Wing Safety will process as Class E safety
   event per AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigation and Reports.
   6.2.4. A CMA violation that did not impact an aircraft operation must be submitted to Wing
   Safety on an AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report, within 24-hours of the violation, and
   completed IAW AFI 13-213, 3.2.8.3.2.6. Wing Safety will process as Class E safety event
   per AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigation and Reports.
   6.2.5. All CMA violations, regardless of impact to flight safety, must be reported at the
   AOB. The driver responsible for the violation will brief the incident at the AOB. The
   DAFM must maintain a copy of all AF IMT 651s/457s filed, actions taken, results and
   supporting documentation for at least six months.
   6.2.6. All drivers accused of committing a CMA violation will immediately report to or be
   escorted to AM Ops. Drivers will surrender their AF IMT 483 and provide a written (signed)
   statement to AM providing the who, what, when, where and how regarding the event.
   6.2.7. The DAFM will notify the unit commander within 24 hours that AM and Flight Safety
   will conduct an investigation. If the driver is found at fault, airfield driving privileges will be
   revoked for a minimum of 60 days. AOF/CC, OSS/CC, or OG/CC will determine the final
   length of suspension based upon the severity of the incident and Flight Safety’s investigation
 38                                                      MILDENHALLI13-213 5 JULY 2013


   results. The unit commander of the violator will be notified in writing by the OSS/CC of the
   final determination. The driver must be retrained (as if they were a new airfield driver) per
   this instruction and obtain a new AF IMT 483 before driving privileges are reinstated. In
   addition to retraining, unit commander's must thoroughly evaluate the individual and provide
   an MFR in addition to required retraining paperwork stating the individual is safe to drive on
   the airfield.
       6.2.7.1. Any MFR requesting reinstatement of airfield driving privileges must detail how
       the mission is adversely affected by the individual not being able to drive on the airfield.
       Use sample Attachment 6.
   6.2.8. Any driver committing a second CMA violation will have airfield driving privileges
   revoked for the remainder of the individual's assignment. The OG/CC holds the authority to
   reinstate airfield driving privileges, in writing, to perform mission essential duties following
   revocation of a driver’s AF IMT 483.
   6.2.9. The DAFM will assign an operational category per AFI 13-213 to each CMAV and
   document on AF IMT 651/457.
6.3. Other Airfield Driving Violations.
   6.3.1. Individuals stopped for suspected violations must surrender their AF IMT 483 (and
   USAFE Form 449 if applicable) upon request. Privileges may be suspended on-site pending
   an investigation regarding the event. If privileges are suspended, another certified driver
   must take control of the vehicle or AM will escort from the airfield.
   6.3.2. Individuals are encouraged to provide a statement detailing who, what, when, where,
   and why occurred during the incident (Be as detailed as possible) to their ADPMs, who will
   coordinate with the DAFM. The DAFM will complete an investigation. Once investigation
   is complete, the DAFM will coordinate with the AFM to determine the disposition of the
   individuals driving privileges. The DAFM will notify the Unit ADPM of investigation
   results. The ADPM must notify the unit commander.
       6.3.2.1. First Violation. Driving privileges may be suspended a minimum of 7 days and
       a maximum of 14 days, depending on the nature of the violation. Additional training will
       be directed by AM specific to the violation. Training must be completed by the Unit
       ADPM and documented on a memo to 100 OSS/OSA. Driver may resume airfield
       driving duties once suspension time is over and additional training has been
       accomplished.
       6.3.2.2. Second Violation. Driving privileges will be suspended for a minimum of 14
       days and a maximum of 30 days. Additional training will be directed by AM specific to
       the violation. Training must be completed by the Unit ADPM and documented on a
       memo endorsed by unit commander to 100 OSS/OSAA. Driver may resume airfield
       driving duties once suspension time is over and additional training has been
       accomplished.

     6.3.2.3. Third Violation. Any driver committing a third violation will have their driving
     privileges revoked for the remainder of the individual's assignment. A unit commander
     requesting airfield driving privileges for a third-time offender must submit a written
     request to 100 OG/CC for consideration. If 100 OG/CC approves continued privileges,
     driver must complete retraining and receive a new AF IMT 483.
