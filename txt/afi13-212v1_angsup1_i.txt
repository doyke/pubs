SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.


The definition of Air Force ranges in this AFI is expanded to include MRTFBs as described in DoD
Directive 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB). This revision of AFI 13-212 reflects a
more integrated operational and engineering approach to range management and provides guidance on
roles and responsibilities in the management of Air Force range operations. The following changes are
added: (1) Provides guidance on Range Planning and Modernization Planning, and identifies the Environ-
mental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Military Munitions Rule as the guiding document used to meet EPA
regulatory requirements on active and inactive ranges. (2) Places responsibility for Air Force range policy
and management under HQ USAF/XOOR. (3) More thoroughly explains the planning and requirements
process for new airspace/range initiatives. (4) Provides guidance on range operations, laser operations,
night operations/Night Vision Devices (NVDs), range personnel training, and weapon safety footprint/
laser safety footprint requirements. (5) Adds policy and planning for Electronic Combat Ranges (ECRs)/
Electronic Scoring Sites (ESSs). (6) Establishes a standard definition and reporting requirement for range
utilization. (7) Adds Ammunition, Explosives, and other Dangerous Articles (AEDA) provisions, changes
residue clearance requirements, and incorporates guidance on the process for evaluating appropriate
response actions on closed, transferred, and transferring ranges containing military munitions. (8) Pro-
vides policy and procedures for use of “Depleted Uranium”.

                                       GENERAL CONCEPTS

1.1. Purpose. This instruction defines Air Force requirements and responsibilities to manage Air Force
ranges. It provides the guidance to implement the policies that govern the use of Air Force ranges and the
framework by which commanders can safely, effectively, and efficiently operate their ranges. These poli-
cies support the goal of balancing the need to accomplish realistic testing and training with the need to
minimize potential impacts of such activities on the environment and the surrounding communities.
1.1. (ANG) Purpose. This supplement further defines ANG specific requirements and responsibilities to
manage ANG ranges in addition to guidance in AFI 13-212, Volumes I, II, and III. All ANG ranges have
significant land mass constraints and/or operational limitations. Due to these limitations, a high level of
operational oversight, command and control is required to protect these national training assets.

1.2. Description of Ranges. A range is any land mass or water body, with the associated Special Use
Airspace (SUA). A range is a designated area established to conduct operations, training, research and
development, and test or evaluation of military hardware, personnel, tactics, munitions, explosives, or
Electronic Combat (EC) systems. Range capabilities and services vary and are dependent upon test and
training requirements delineated by the MAJCOMs.
    1.2.1. Primary Training Range (PTR). PTRs usually accommodate basic to intermediate air-to-sur-
    face training. Primary Training Ranges (PTR) normally consist of land of a limited size, approxi-
    mately 5000-100,000 acres. Typical PTRs contain target arrays, threat simulators, and weapons
    scoring systems and provide Service Class A, B, and/or C range capabilities. (See paragraph 1.3.5.).
    PTRs normally support the training requirements of a specific unit and are in close geographic prox-
    imity to their primary users.
    1.2.1. (ANG) ANG ranges are defined as either Primary Training Range (PTR) or Intermediate Train-
    ing Ranges (ITR) and provide service Class "A" capabilities. An ITR may also be referred to as a
    Combat Training Center (CTC) Range. In the ANG, an ITR is often associated with a Combat Readi-
    ness Training Center. The 266 Range Control Squadron (RANS) is an Electronic Combat Range
    (ECR).
    1.2.2. Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB). DoD Directive 3200.11, Major Range and Test
    Facility Base (MRTFB), establishes the policy and responsibilities for the management and operation
    of specific DoD T&E activities (collectively referred to as the MRTFB). The MRTFB is part of the
    National Test Facilities Base. MRTFBs are national assets that exist primarily to provide T&E infor-
    mation to DoD decision-makers and to support the T&E needs of DoD research programs and weapon
    system development programs. MRTFBs also support DoD’s training needs. The Air Force Air War-
    fare Center (Nellis AFB), the Air Force Air Armament Center (Eglin AFB), and the Utah Test and
    Training Range (UTTR) also serve as dual test/training MRTFBs. Other U.S. government agencies
    (federal, state, local, and tribal), allied foreign governments, and defense contractors may use
    MRTFBs. Private organizations and commercial enterprises may also use MRTFBs if authorized.
    MRTFB commanders will ensure that they are not competing with U.S. private industry in providing
    services to commercial or non-DoD government users. Use of these facilities by private organizations
    and commercial enterprises should not increase DoD’s cost to operate MRTFBs, and should not be
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                    7


   factored into the decision-making process for sizing, operating, and maintaining the T&E infrastruc-
   ture.
   1.2.2. (ANG) ITR ranges will be equipped to operate at a higher level of tactical training (threats,
   etc.) than typical PTRs in order to accommodate larger scale deployments, Large Force Exercises
   (LFEs) not normally available for Home Station Training.

1.3. Operations and Range Classifications. Range operations require that the surface area (land or sea)
encompassing the weapon safety footprints or surface area underlying the air-to-air range be protected by
purchase, lease, or other restriction to ensure the safety of personnel, structures, and the public from
expended rockets, missiles, or target debris. The Range Operating Agency (ROA) will perform a risk
assessment and establish mission parameters to minimize potential safety hazards associated with weap-
ons employment. The ROA will assess the weapon safety footprints against each intended target to ensure
new weapons, platforms, and/or tactics can be employed safely before actual use on a range. In no case
employ actual weapons outside DoD SUA specifically authorized for the employment activity. When the
employment envelope of the weapon is outside the rangeland, the ROA will perform a risk assessment
and ensure public notification of the activity. The ROA will conduct a risk assessment for launching
off-range onto targets on the range, and will ensure safety mechanisms are in place to avoid off-range
impacts.
1.3. (ANG) Operations and Range Classifications. The Range Operating Agency (ROA) will nor-
mally be the parent Wing, Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC) or State Headquarters. ROA
responsibilities may be delegated no lower than the Range Commander.

       266th RANS - ECR                              366 OSS, ID
    1.3.1. Air-to-Surface. Air-to-Surface operations cover a wide range of mission requirements. Ranges
    that support, for example, complex multi-aircraft operations, air-to-surface missiles, aeronautical sys-
    tem testing, unmanned vehicles, and cruise missiles require a substantial amount of range space and a
    sophisticated range infrastructure. This infrastructure may include high fidelity threat simulators,
    visual threat simulators, scoring capabilities, realistic surface attack target arrays, command and con-
    trol systems, communication networks, data display/processing capabilities, instrumentation/debrief
    systems, flight termination systems, and flight hazard analysis/impact prediction capability.
    1.3.1. (ANG) ANG Ranges will be equipped and RCOs will be trained to act as Ground Forward Air
    Controllers for CAS Training missions. RCOs will provide CAS input as well as laser illuminator and
    designator wing weapons and tactics directive and in compliance with Joint Tactics, Techniques, and
    Procedures for CSA, Joint Pub 3-09.3. ANG ranges will provide SSS and electronic threats as
    required by mission training requirements.
    1.3.2. Electronic Combat Range (ECR)/Electronic Scoring Site (ESS). ECRs/ESSs provide a simu-
    lated electronic threat environment for aircrew combat training. ECR/ESS facilities and equipment
    can be located at air-to-air or air-to-surface ranges, in or near a Military Training Route (MTR) or a
    Military Operations Area (MOA), or outside of USAF ranges and SUA.
    1.3.3. Surface-to-Air. Surface-to-Air operations cover a wide range of mission requirements. Ranges
    that support, for example, endo- exoatmospheric missile intercepts, aeronautical system testing, and
    ballistic missiles require a substantial amount of range space and a sophisticated range infrastructure.
    This infrastructure may include high fidelity simulators, visual simulators, end-game scoring capabil-
    ities, command and control systems, communication networks, data display/processing capabilities,
    instrumentation systems, flight termination systems, and flight hazard analysis/impact prediction
    capability.
    1.3.4. Air-to-Air. Air-to-Air operations cover a wide range of mission requirements. Ranges that sup-
    port, for example, air-to-air operations involving simulated and actual employment of missiles,
    air-to-air gunnery, aeronautical system testing, unmanned vehicles, and Electronic Combat require a
    substantial amount of range space and a sophisticated range infrastructure. This infrastructure may
    include high fidelity simulators, visual simulators, end-game scoring capabilities, command and con-
    trol systems, communication networks, data display/processing capabilities, instrumentation systems,
    flight termination systems, and flight hazard analysis/impact prediction capability.
       1.3.4.1. Air Combat Training System (ACTS). ACTS ranges are specially instrumented air-to-air
       ranges that provide unique capabilities to observe activities real-time and/or record these activities
       for aircrew feedback.
           1.3.4.1.1. Ground-based Flight Instrumentation Range Systems. These systems provide
           weapon simulations, Time-Space-Position-Information (TSPI), and aircrew kill notification in
           near-real time using ground based towers and communications relays. Ground-based comput-
           ers use weapons simulation fly-out models to determine air-to-air kill probabilities. The Range
           Training Officer (RTO) relays the kill notification.
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                         9


          1.3.4.1.2. Rangeless/Untethered Flight Instrumentation Range Systems. Rangeless/untethered
          systems use pod-to-pod data links and/or onboard recorders carried onboard participating air-
          craft to compute weapon simulations, and provide kill notification. Air-to-air weapon simula-
          tions and real-time kill notification are accomplished by automatically computing weapon
          simulations and kill probabilities within “smart” flight instrumentation pods. An RTO is not
          required for kill notification.
       1.3.4.2. Live Air-to-Air Gunnery Operations. Air-to-air targets such as towed devices and Aerial
       Gunnery Target System (AGTS) are used for live air-to-air gunnery operations. The aircraft per-
       formance capabilities and the appropriate munitions ballistic tables determine the airspace and
       surface area required for safe performance.
       1.3.4.3. Range Integration Instrumentation System (RIIS). RIIS is a near-real time data acquisi-
       tion and storage system. RIIS integrates range equipment located at ECRs and ESSs. Data
       received from range equipment includes, but is not limited to, aircraft position, emitted threats,
       Electronic Counter-Measures (ECM), and weapon delivery.
   1.3.5. Range Classifications/Types of Service. The following are the USAF range classifications:
   1.3.5. (ANG) All ANG weapons ranges normally support the requirements of local ANG units and
   are available for use by other United States (US) Military services. Due to relatively small landmass
   and proximity to adjacent cultural areas, class B or C operations are not authorized on any ANG
   Range during weapons employment operations or laser (emitting eye and/or skin hazards) operations.
       1.3.5.1. Service Class A. This range is manned, has a ground-based scoring capability, and has a
       Range Control Officer (RCO) who controls aircraft using the range. Delegation of weapons
       release authority by the RCO occurs when the RCO can not positively determine aircraft attitude,
       orientation, etc. (e.g., loss of visual contact, night or high altitude releases, or loss of positional
       data information from ground-based radar or other instrumentation). However, as long as the RCO
       is present on the range, the service provided remains Class A. In situations where the RCO dele-
       gates safe release of ordnance to a flight lead, individual pilot, Forward Air Controller (FAC), or
       other briefed person, the RCO maintains overall authority on the range and can deny release clear-
       ance or abort the release at any time. If the flight lead, individual pilot, FAC, or other briefed per-
       son accepts delegation of weapons release authority from the RCO, they are solely responsible for
       safe release of ordnance on that pass.
       1.3.5.2. Service Class B. This range is manned or unmanned, has a ground-based scoring capabil-
       ity, but does not have an RCO controlling aircraft. The flight lead, individual pilot, FAC, or other
       briefed person performs the RCO function.
       1.3.5.3. Service Class C. This range is unmanned, with no scoring or aircraft control from the
       ground. The flight lead, individual pilot, FAC, or other briefed person performs the RCO function.
       1.3.5.4. Service Class D. This is an instrumented air-to-air range monitored by an RTO. The RTO
       acts as a training facilitator, ensures all aircraft pods are tracking, and performs real-time kill
       removal as requested and briefed by the flight lead. Air-to-air training may occur within the SUA
       without live RTO monitoring if the aircraft can not use ACTS or if the using agency does not
       request an ACTS debrief.

1.4. Environmental Stewardship - Range Planning. Air Force range policy centers around balancing
three important areas: readiness, environmental responsibility, and public safety. The Air Force has a
10                                                       AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005


responsibility to ensure it operates in an environmentally responsible manner while sustaining the highest
levels of readiness to meet its mission requirements.
     1.4.1. Sustain Readiness. Preserving the long-term environmental vitality of Air Force range assets
     contributes significantly to readiness. Units will develop and maintain range plans with an Executive
     Summary of the Comprehensive Range Plan suitable for inclusion in the installation’s General Plan to
     address operational and environmental issues and support current and future test and training mission
     requirements.
     1.4.2. Environmental Responsibility. The second area of emphasis requires close cooperation in envi-
     ronmental matters between the Air Force leadership and other federal, state, local, and tribal govern-
     ment agencies. Integrate natural and cultural resources management into range planning IAW AFI
     32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources Management, and AFI 32-7065, Cultural Resources Manage-
     ment. Willingness to define the purpose and need for Air Force ranges and to describe the importance
     of the test and training missions enhances credibility and increases public understanding and support.
     Mitigating adverse impacts from daily operations at active and inactive military ranges is an important
     part of effective community relations. Coordinate all community actions with the Public Affairs
     office.
        1.4.2.1. Military Munitions Rule. Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 260, Military Muni-
        tions Rule regulates activities on active and inactive ranges. MAJCOMs/ROAs will comply with
        the guidance established in the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Military Munitions
        Rule to meet EPA regulatory requirements on active and inactive ranges. Ensure environmental
        management flights are involved in the process.
        1.4.2.1. (ANG) The ROA will coordinate with Base Civil Engineering (BCE) for Title 40, Code
        of Federal Regulations, Part 260, Military Munitions Rule. The ROA will coordinate with the BCE
        for UXO clearance. If ANG support is required for UXO clearance, coordination through BCE
        and ANG, Airspace, Ranges and Combat Readiness Training Division (ANG/C4R) is required.
        1.4.2.2. Ammunition, Explosives, and Other Dangerous Articles (AEDA)/Range Residue Clear-
        ance/Decontamination. Each MAJCOM/ROA is responsible for AEDA/range residue clearance/
        decontamination on active and inactive ranges under its control IAW DoD Directive 4715.11,
        Environmental and Explosives Safety Management on Department of Defense Active and Inactive
        Ranges Within the United States and DoD Directive 4715.12, Environmental and Explosives
        Safety Management on Department of Defense Active and Inactive Ranges Outside the United
        States. MAJCOMs/ROAs should manage ranges and targets to maintain long-term viability of
        DoD ranges while protecting human health and the environment and to minimize future clearance
        costs. Ranges and munitions should be designed to minimize potential explosive hazards and
        harmful environmental impacts and to promote resource recovery and recycling.
     1.4.3. Public Safety. The Air Force has a responsibility to protect the public to the maximum extent
     possible from the hazards and effects associated with range operations. This third area of emphasis
     requires leveraging resources by using new technology. Investment strategies will focus on preventing
     pollution, eliminating hazards, and reducing costs by using cost benefit and life cycle analysis tools.

1.5. Modernization Planning. Modernization Planning, governed by AFPD 10-14, Modernization
Planning, consists of Mission Area Plans (MAPs) and Mission Support Plans (MSPs). It establishes the
process to identify and correct deficiencies in mission and functional areas. The results of these activities
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                     11


will be included in the Comprehensive Range Plan. MAPs/MSPs comprise capability roadmaps outlining
a modernization plan to correct task deficiencies. For ranges, they represent an iterative process from the
HQ USAF to the local unit level showing in increasing detail how the various levels fulfill range require-
ments for the Air Force’s mission areas. MAJCOMs evaluate Air Force mission areas and functions, pin-
point mission specific deficiencies or cross cutting mission support deficiencies, and develop cost
affective, mitigating strategies to overcome the deficiencies to achieve the combat capabilities needed in
the future. MAPs/MSPs forecast into the future and provide planning data to USAF’s Program Objective
Memorandum (POM).
1.5. (ANG) Modernization Planning. The ANG Range Master Plan will be maintained and updated by
ANG/C4R.
   1.5.1. (Added-ANG) The ROA for ANG PTRs, ITRs and ECRs will develop and maintain a Com-
   prehensive Range Plan.

1.6. Exemptions and Waivers to AFI 13-212. Requests for exemptions and waivers to this instruction
will be clearly defined and will be based on existing critical circumstances involving operations, mainte-
nance, and/or safety issues. Any change in critical circumstances is cause for review of the exemption or
waiver. The ROA is responsible for monitoring these circumstances and suspending activities permitted
by the exemption or waiver when safety is in question. If safety is not the issue, operations and mainte-
nance activities may continue, pending review of the exemption or waiver, unless the ROA judges them
inappropriate. In either case, the ROA must request an immediate review of the exemption or waiver
through the corresponding MAJCOM (or equivalent) to HQ USAF/XOOR.
   1.6.1. Exemptions. An exemption is a permanent approval for non-compliance with a specific
   requirement of this instruction. Exemptions will remain in effect for as long as the conditions remain
   unchanged. ROAs will review exemptions every five years to confirm that conditions have not
   changed. Generally, an exemption is issued only when it is apparent that conditions can not be allevi-
   ated and the Air Force is willing to accept the risk involved.
   1.6.2. Waivers. A waiver is temporary and requires a plan to alleviate the condition. It has an expira-
   tion date of one year from the approval date or when the condition is alleviated, whichever occurs
   first.
   1.6.3. Request for Exemption or Waiver. A request for exemption or waiver should contain, as a min-
   imum, the following information:
       1.6.3.1. Range name and location.
       1.6.3.2. ROA and a point-of-contact.
       1.6.3.3. Requested exception to AFI 13-212. Reference the specific paragraph.
       1.6.3.4. Description of the conditions at issue. Include maps, charts, photos, drawings, and other
       data to illustrate or define these conditions.
       1.6.3.5. Description of potential alternatives and their impact on test and training operations,
       maintenance, cost, and other factors deemed appropriate by the requesting agency.
       1.6.3.6. Description of proposed actions and procedures to mitigate safety or other issues of con-
       cern. Include maps, charts, graphics, or other illustrations as appropriate.

        1.6.3.7. For waiver requests, propose a plan to alleviate the condition. Include project milestones
        and any additional information bearing on the issue. Forward requests to MAJCOM for review
        and coordination.
     1.6.4. Exemption or Waiver Coordination and Approval. MAJCOMs will forward requests for
     exemptions and waivers to this instruction to HQ USAF/XOOR for coordination and approval.
     1.6.4. (ANG) Exemption or Waiver Coordination and Approval Requests will be forwarded through
     ANG/C4R to HQ USAF/XOO-RA.

1.7. Volume Changes. Forward recommendations for change to this instruction on AF Form 847, Rec-
ommendation for Change of Publication, through channels, to HQ USAF/XOOR, 1480 Air Force Penta-
gon, Washington, DC 20330-1480.
1.7. (ANG) Volume Changes. Recommendations for changes to AFI 13-212 will be forwarded to HQ

     tion, points-of-contact, updated procedures, access to the local supplement to this instruction, sched-
     uling information, etc. The home page will serve as the initial entry point for users to obtain
     information on the range and points-of-contact for questions.
     2.7.5. Range Supplement. Develop and publish a local range operations and maintenance supplement
     to this instruction. Supplements will be reviewed and updated annually and may be published in hard
     copy or electronically. Range supplements should be included on the DoD access range home page.
        2.7.5.1. Range Supplement Content. The range supplement must include, but is not limited to:
        general range description; services available; hours of operation; range diagrams; range schedul-
        ing procedures; operations; safety; emergency and jettison procedures; authorized ordnance;
        weapon safety footprint data; authorized frequency clearances; RCO procedures; chaff and flare
        operations; night, NVD operations, and laser procedures; range utilization report preparation;
        approval and submission procedures; support agency procedures/agreements; and definitive guid-
        ance for coordinating and scheduling all range operations to include maintenance, Explosive Ord-
        nance Disposal, and fire fighting responsibilities.
        2.7.5.1. (ANG) ANG Range Local Supplements will establish procedures for complying with
        SAFE-RANGE. ANG and Local Range Supplements to AFI 13-212, Volumes I-III, as well as
        local Range flight operation, flying and ground safety procedure manuals will be located in the
        main tower facility.
     2.7.6. Range Maintenance Schedule. Develop an annual range maintenance and clearance/ decontam-
     ination schedule that complies with the requirements of this instruction. Maintenance will be preven-
     tative as well as corrective. The Functional Director or Functional Commander will have overall
     responsibility for oversight. Quality Assurance (QA) personnel will have responsibility for evaluating
     and documenting contractor performance IAW the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).
     2.7.7. Range Target Preparation/Maintenance and Residue Clearance. Schedule all range residue
     clearance and final removal/disposal. The unit Comprehensive Range Plan will include the clearance
     schedule and life cycle Target Area preparation/maintenance and residue disposal/removal plan.
     Whenever possible, design, locate, and maintain targets to minimize future residue clearance costs to
     include use of innovative range clearance technologies and best management practices (target material
     substitution, recycling, etc.).
     2.7.7. (ANG) The type of target selected or target construction will be based on target suitability and
     projected life cycle cost. The following factors will be considered when selecting the type of target
     and construction; Level of target fidelity required to satisfy aircrew training requirements; Type train-
     ing event(s) and ordinance(s) the target will be used for; Target location and accessibility for replace-
     ment or maintenance; Target material suitability and potential recycling opportunity. NOTE: Using
     the above criteria will assist the range manager in selecting the appropriate target for a given event/
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                         17


  scenario. For example; A soft target, Joint Modular Ground Target (JMGT) may be more appropriate
  for a given training/exercise event due to the level of activity or target fidelity required. In other cases,
  such as for 30mm strafe it may be more advantageous to use a durable hard target (main battle tank)
  to reduce the frequency of target replacement. The final target determination should consider which
  target satisfies the training requirement and is the most cost effective.
  2.7.8. Range Safety. Establish range safety procedures. Range operations must ensure optimum range
  use while maintaining the highest standards of safety. Maintain a record showing weapon safety foot-
  print application and authorization for each target, manned facilities, and equipment on the range.
  2.7.9. Range Security. Establish range security procedures. ROAs will establish physical safeguards
  for scoring devices, communications, instrumentation, maintenance, and classified equipment. Addi-
  tionally, security for reasons of safety is required. ROAs will establish physical safeguards/procedures
  with joint military and outside agencies, specifying range access control procedures. The ROA may
  delegate the authority, not the responsibility, for range security to other organizations or to civilian
  contract personnel.
  2.7.10. Range Operations Officer (ROO). Appoint a ROO (in writing) to supervise daily range man-
  agement, planning, and maintenance. The ROO will be a commissioned officer or DoD civilian
  employee. On contracted ranges, the ROO will normally have the QA responsibilities. For ANG
  ranges and MRTFBs, the ROA will designate the responsibilities of the ROO. The ROO or designated
  individual has authority over all ground operations and support functions on the range.
  2.7.10. (ANG) RCOs for ANG ranges must be a Rated Officer with a minimum of 500 hours experi-
  ence in a tactical aircraft and experience in ordinance delivery on a tactical range. RCOs will be qual-
  ified as a Drop Zone Safety Officer if the range has a certified Drop Zone. Waivers to these
  qualifications will be requested through ANG/C4R. RCOs assigned to ANG Ranges are encouraged
  to maintain currency in tactical aircraft.
      2.7.10.1. (Added-ANG) RCO Currency. To maintain Range currency, each RCO must:
          2.7.10.1.1. (Added-ANG) Complete initial qualification/certification training IAW this
          instruction and local checkout procedures.
          2.7.10.1.2. (Added-ANG) Perform RCO duty at least once every 365 days.
          2.7.10.1.3. (Added-ANG) RCO Re-currency. If an RCO becomes non-current The Range
          commander, Range Operations Officer or current RCO delegated by the range commander
          may re-certify the RCO by observing him/her in the performance of all RCO duties. After 365
          days of non-currency the RCO must complete the entire check out program.
          2.7.10.1.4. (Added-ANG) The RCO/enlisted duty day should not exceed 12 hours. Duty days
          in excess of 12 hours require notification of the next higher level of authority. The ROA
          should establish local requirements for crew rest to ensure crew safety and safe conduct of
          range operations.
  2.7.11. Range Control Officer (RCO). The ROA will certify RCOs in writing. The ROA will ensure
  that RCOs are fully qualified and trained IAW this instruction and MAJCOM supplements before
  assuming RCO duties. (Exception: for overseas ranges operated by a host nation, the USAF unit using
  the range will certify RCO training and qualification IAW this instruction and MAJCOM supple-
  ments.) An RCO may be a military member, a DoD civilian employee, or a government contractor,
18                                                        AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005


     but as a desired minimum, RCOs must have rated, Air Traffic Control (ATC), Tactical Air Control
     Party (TACP), or weapons controller experience.
        2.7.11.1. Service Class A Range. For Service Class A ranges, the RCO is responsible for all range
        operations and air/ground safety, except in cases where weapons release clearance is delegated. If
        the RCO can not positively determine that the aircraft can release safely, the RCO will delegate
        ordnance release clearance to a qualified flight lead, individual pilot, FAC, or other briefed person,
        by declaring “Authorized (flight lead, individual pilot, FAC, etc.) Control.” In cases where the
        RCO delegates safe release of ordnance, the RCO will maintain overall authority on the range and
        can abort the release at any time, however, the pilot assumes sole responsibility for safe release of
        ordnance. The RCO must maintain continuous radio communication with all aircraft on the range
        and will ensure each aircraft is cleared or declare “Authorized (flight lead, individual pilot, FAC,
        etc.) Control” before every hot pass, to continue a dry pass, or prior to commencing laser opera-
        tions IAW Joint Pub 3-09.3, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Close Air Support
        (CAS).
        2.7.11.2. Service Class B and C Ranges. On Service Class B and C ranges, the flight lead, individ-
        ual pilot, FAC, or other briefed person assumes the responsibilities of the RCO and is responsible
        for safe release of ordnance.
        2.7.11.3. Aerial Gunnery. The duties and responsibilities of the RCO will be IAW AFI 11-214,
        Aircrew, Weapons Director, and Terminal Attack Controller Procedures for Air Operations.
     2.7.12. Range Training Officer (RTO). On Service Class D ranges, the primary RTO responsibilities
     in addition to flight safety are to facilitate training, provide real-time kill removal, and assist flight
     leads in mission reconstruction during debriefs. During autonomous air-to-air training (conducted
     without GCI or AWACS), the RTO may assist aircrews in maintaining aircraft inside airspace bound-
     aries and expedite rejoins upon request. The RTO may be military or contractor furnished, but as a
     minimum, RTOs must possess "rated mission expertise" in the activity being performed or have Air
     Battle Manager/Weapons Director experience.
     2.7.12. (ANG) For the ANG, RTOs must be a rated officer with a minimum of 500 hours in tactical
     aircraft or have Air Battle Manager/Weapons Director experience. Waivers to these qualifications will
     be requested through ANG/C4R. RTOs assigned to ANG ACTS Ranges are encouraged to maintain
     weapon system currency.

2.8. Wing/Center Safety Responsibilities. The Chief of Wing/Center Safety will:
     2.8.1. Develop and implement required programs, practices, and procedures to reduce risk to the pub-
     lic, personnel, and resources and maximize mission accomplishment.
     2.8.2. Advise commanders on safety requirements for all operations.
     2.8.3. Provide wing experts for safety oversight/guidance on operational and T&E issues.
     2.8.4. Provide mission safety requirements for operational and T&E procedures.
     2.8.5. Develop standardized safety requirements.
     2.8.6. Manage the weapons safety mishap-reporting program.
     2.8.7. Investigate, report, and identify corrective actions for safety deficiencies, high accident poten-
     tials, and mishaps.
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                      19


   2.8.8. Establish operational safety criteria and establish display, tracking, and data processing param-
   eters.
   2.8.9. Provide analysis of flight safety criteria and establish display, tracking and data processing
   parameters.
   2.8.10. Conduct analysis and advise commanders of in-flight impact, explosive, toxic, laser, radiolog-
   ical, and acoustic hazards.
   2.8.11. Review and coordinate all unit operations and training documentation.

2.9. Range Safety Personnel Responsibilities. Range Safety Officers (RSOs), and Flight Safety Offic-
ers (FSOs) or equivalent will all be qualified military officers or government civilians. Individual Range
Commanders shall establish specific qualification requirements.

2.10. National, Regional, and Local Range and Airspace Meetings. Actions involving use, creation,
modification, or transfer of military airspace/ranges generate significant public interest. The Air Force
must be prepared to address concerns raised at the local, regional, or national level during the develop-
ment of any airspace/range action. AFI 13-201 describes the various forums that allow units, MAJCOMs,
and HQ USAF to focus on airspace/range issues and exchange information and lessons learned in air-
space/range development. These meetings ensure USAF offices involved in an airspace/range initiative
have a common understanding of the objectives, status, and important issues and provide for a thorough
review by an interdisciplinary team in place at all management levels. The meetings also keep the mem-
bers informed of national level events and trends impacting airspace/range actions. Depending on the spe-
cific forum, membership is open to DoD representatives as well as representatives from other federal,
state, local, and tribal government agencies, private organizations, and special interest groups to exchange
constructive information concerning airspace/range actions. There are DoD-only sessions where it is
appropriate for units to introduce an airspace/range issue or new initiative before presenting it in a Test/
Training Space Need Statement (T/TSNS).

                                                Chapter 3

                                      PLANNING FOR RANGES

3.1. Planning for Ranges. Test and training space (airspace/ranges) includes the air, land, or sea space
that is specifically used to conduct readiness test and training activities. Planning for the ranges consists
of: the preliminary review processes to establish a requirement; development of the proposal for formal
review and public comment, and planning/procuring of instrumentation, threat systems, and test/training
range engineering development. The goal of the range planning process is to identify any existing or
potential conflicts and to propose alternative solutions and recommendations.

3.2. Preliminary Review Process. Major actions to establish, change use, modify, or delete test/training
space (including ranges or permanent airspace), except those purely administrative in nature, are
reviewed by units, MAJCOMs, and HQ USAF. New and on-going T/TSNSs are addressed at the applica-
ble range and airspace meetings to provide a regional perspective to on-going initiatives. Proponents
describe the concept, action, and alternatives in a T/TSNS. The T/TSNS is a brief document, in plain letter
and/or outline, designed to facilitate the airspace/range review process described below, before initiating
the formal aeronautical and environmental proposal processes. The T/TSNS aids the process and outlines
some of the potential issues associated with proposed test/training actions. It provides a standard vehicle
to obtain MAJCOM and Air Staff review, assistance, and validation early in the process. The T/TSNS is
the first step in the Air Force Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP), and once validated, it
serves as the starting point for developing the Description of Proposed Action and Alternatives (DOPAA).
     3.2.1. Other Range Users' Needs. In addition to the primary user, other range users may have needs.
     When any range-related action is contemplated, the proponent has the responsibility to notify users,
     including other MAJCOMs and Services, and solicit their input during the preliminary review pro-
     cesses. In addition, range users have a responsibility to notify the ROA any time their needs change.
     ROAs should establish a dialogue with users. Periodic conferences, which offer face-to-face contact,
     are often the most effective medium to stimulate dialogue. Other mediums such as computer bulletin
     boards, correspondence, and telephone contacts may supplement conferences or provide a substitute if
     a conference is not practical. Including other range users’ needs strengthens the T/TSNS and adds
     support for the initiative. The proponent should require that all users formally submit their needs,
     signed by the appropriate authority, so they can be documented and included in the T/TSNS.
     3.2.2. Procedures. Development of the T/TSNS varies depending upon the level of initiation and
     scope of the need. Units may initiate their own T/TSNS for perceived needs or MAJCOMs may direct
     a unit to initiate a T/TSNS for a unit mission change. For example, an F-16 unit may be directed to
     change their mission from air defense to general purpose or a fighter unit may be given a new missile
     with different operating parameters than the current airspace would allow. At a higher level, a MAJ-
     COM may have the need to initiate a significant change in operations for a new weapon system. Unit
     or MAJCOM procedures apply as follows:
        3.2.2.1. Unit T/TSNS. For unit proponents, the T/TSNS is initially coordinated through the unit
        and validated by the wing commander (or equivalent). The unit then forwards the T/TSNS to the
        MAJCOM for review, comment, and/or concurrence, as appropriate.
        3.2.2.2. MAJCOM and Air Staff Review. If the MAJCOM concurs with an initiative, it forwards
        the T/TSNS to HQ USAF/XOOR, with an information copy to the Air Force Representative
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                        21


       (AFREP), for Air Staff review and comment. This includes ANG and AFRC T/TSNSs. The Air
       Staff (USAF/XOOR, USAF/ILEV, SAF/MIQ, and SAF/GCN) review will be completed within 30
       calendar days of HQ USAF/XOOR receiving the document. The MAJCOM and Air Staff will
       resolve issues identified during this initial review to their mutual satisfaction.
       3.2.2.3. MAJCOM T/TSNS. If a MAJCOM initiates the T/TSNS, then the MAJCOM concur-
       rently forwards it to HQ USAF/XOOR and the AFREP for Air Staff review/comment. A MAJ-
       COM-initiated T/TSNS is appropriate when a new weapon system or weapon requires a
       significant change in SUA configuration (e.g., F-22, JDAM, etc.). In this case, the lead MAJCOM
       validates the SUA need and submits the T/TSNS to HQ USAF/XOOR for review/comment. The
       Air Staff and AFREP review/comment will be completed before submitting the T/TSNS to USAF/
       XOO.

3.3. Develop Description of Proposed Actions and Alternatives (DOPAA). O n c e t h e A i r S t a f f
reviews/comments on the T/TSNS, the next step is to write a DOPAA.
   3.3.1. DOPAA - General Information. The DOPAA provides the framework for assessing the envi-
   ronmental impact of a proposal. It describes the purpose and need for the action, the alternatives, and
   the rationale used to arrive at the proposed action. The T/TSNS serves as the starting point for devel-
   oping the DOPAA. The DOPAA includes a Background/Purpose statement, a section detailing the
   Need, a Proposed Action section, and a section listing the Alternatives. The remaining three sections
   reiterate the Decision to be Made, provide the Identification of the Decision Maker, and outline any
   Anticipated Issues. Although the proponent of the action is the one tasked to provide a complete
   DOPAA, the development of the DOPAA is a team effort. It is essential that operations, engineering,
   legal, logistics, plans, and others on the staff work together to provide all relevant inputs to ensure the
   DOPAA portrays an accurate description of the proposed action and alternatives. For DOPAA prepa-
   ration guidance, refer to AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process.
       3.3.1.1. Factors Influencing the Development of the DOPAA. When developing a DOPAA, the
       proponent needs to consider several factors during the development process. These factors help
       guide the planner and facilitate the identification of problem areas. If problem areas are identified
       during this initial assessment, the planner needs to assess their impacts and if possible, modify the
       proposal to eliminate or mitigate these problem areas. However, this initial assessment does not
       replace the EIAP. It is a tool to help proponents identify potential problem areas early in the devel-
       opment process, thus, significantly improving the success of the proposal, and ultimately saving
       time and money. The bottom line is an optimum proposal that balances the need to accomplish
       realistic testing/training with the need to minimize the potential impacts on the environment and
       the community.
       3.3.1.2. Factors to be Considered when Developing the DOPAA. There are many factors to con-
       sider when developing a DOPAA. These include Operational; Operations & Maintenance
       (O&M); Airspace; Safety; and Environmental, Cultural, and Natural Resource factors. These fac-
       tors are not all-inclusive, but do provide a starting point. Each individual proposal has a unique set
       of factors. Proponents must be flexible and should be prepared to identify and address these fac-
       tors.
          3.3.1.2.1. Operational Factors. The proponent must document operational requirements as
          early as possible in the planning process. Users must formally submit all needs used to derive
          operational requirements. It is critical that commanders (or designated representatives)
22                                                AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005


     approve their proposal submission. In cases where classified initiatives are involved, MAJ-
     COMs will provide guidance on documentation requirements. HQ USAF will provide input
     and direction as required and will keep the Congressional delegations informed of the progress
     of the proposal. Consider the following needs:
        3.3.1.2.1.1. Adequate range time availability to meet mission requirements. Planners must
        consider the number and length of range periods, day and night, needed for all users.
        Include time needed for daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual maintenance and res-
        idue clearance periods. These maintenance activities must be accommodated and must not
        be secondary to operations. In addition, include range weather trends and specify whether
        the range is shared with another Service or the test community.
        3.3.1.2.1.2. Flexibility to restructure targets and threats to meet current and projected mis-
        sion requirements. The scenarios needed to support users' requirements may vary or
        change from time-to-time, depending upon changed tasking or other factors. Also, period-
        ically creating a new layout can keep the challenge in training missions and possibly help
        reduce complacency. Obviously, the more land and airspace available, the more flexible
        range operators can be in restructuring targets and threats. Unfortunately, land and airspace
        are usually the limiting factors, therefore, collaborating with the weapons and training
        officers on target and threat layouts is required.
        3.3.1.2.1.3. Ability to accommodate various test and training events and scenarios based
        on each user's needs. This factor ties in closely with the previous one. It helps establish the
        minimum size requirements of the proposed range. When determining test/training space
        requirements, consider such factors as: Mission Design Series (MDS); types of munitions;
        weapon safety footprints for the kind of weapons proposed for use on the range; maneu-
        vering space for multiple axis of attack; IP to target distances; high altitude attack tactics;
        flight patterns; live ordnance employment (if required); threat dispersion needs; and facil-
        ity locations.
        3.3.1.2.1.4. Capability to support composite force exercises. The airspace/range manager
        must be aware of this need early in the process since this factor may have a far-reaching
        impact on the various controlling agencies and may require a large training space.
        3.3.1.2.1.5. Provide scoring and aircrew feedback systems. These systems are important
        in the training environment, for both aircrews and supervisors. Some common remotely
        operated scoring and feedback systems include: Television Ordnance Scoring System
        (TOSS); Joint Advanced Weapon Scoring System (JAWSS); aircraft instrumentation sys-
        tems such as the Air Combat Training Systems (ACTS); future systems such as the Joint
        Tactical Combat Training System (JTCTS); and other rangeless/untethered ACTS.
        3.3.1.2.1.6. Be within the operational radius of the primary user to permit un-refueled,
        daily use, while optimizing test and training activities with administrative transit time.
        This is most important for the daily users of the range. Occasional users may be able to live
        with other arrangements such as refueling, deployment, etc. This need must be clear in the
        user's statement of need.
        3.3.1.2.1.7. Accessibility of the test/training space by established Military Training
        Routes (MTRs) and/or low altitude Military Operations Areas (MOAs).
     3.3.1.2.2. Operations and Maintenance Factors.
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                 23


          3.3.1.2.2.1. Ensure the range is reasonably accessible to the operating agency. Driving
          time, roads, and road conditions must be suitable for routine maintenance and residue
          clearance procedures. Consider seasonal hazards, such as ice, snow, flooding, and mud
          when evaluating year-round availability. Bridges providing primary access must accom-
          modate all range equipment. Include any needed road or bridge construction in the analysis
          for costing purposes.
          3.3.1.2.2.2. Projected cost of development, operation, and maintenance of the range must
          not be prohibitive, as determined by the MAJCOM. This factor is difficult to quantify dur-
          ing early stages of planning. From a construction and maintenance perspective (see para-
          graph 3.3.1.2.5. for the environmental perspective), try to avoid wetlands, inaccessible
          mountains, ravine areas, and other difficult terrain.
          3.3.1.2.2.3. Conduct a hazard assessment before any range clearance operations and
          obtain EOD input concerning ease of UXO and residue removal. Minimize the use of tar-
          gets that contain hazardous materials (petroleum, oils, lubricants, radium dials, radioactive
          materials, and batteries). Establish safe and practical methods for recycling and disposing
          of range residues IAW DoD Manual 4160.21-M, Defense Reutilization and Marketing
          Manual.
       3.3.1.2.3. Airspace Factors.
          3.3.1.2.3.1. Ensure adequate airspace for aircraft maneuvering and weapons employment
          (simulated and/or live) is available. Proximity of airports, published airways, jet routes,
          Restricted Airspace, MOAs, MTRs, Low Altitude Training (LOWAT) areas, and nearby
          communities must not constrain development of airspace.
          3.3.1.2.3.2. Ensure adequate MTRs, holding areas, and range entry and exit points are
          available.
          3.3.1.2.3.3. AFI 13-201, Air Force Airspace Management, unit/MAJCOM airspace/range
          managers, and the assigned AFREP will have more information on these factors.
       3.3.1.2.4. Safety Factors.
          3.3.1.2.4.1. Nearby air or ground activity must not jeopardize range or flight safety.
          Examples are antenna farms, high voltage transmission lines located along low-altitude
          routes, and glider and hot-air balloon areas.
          3.3.1.2.4.2. Provisions for security, fire protection, and restriction of access must be
          achievable. Restriction of access means limiting access to the range by unauthorized indi-
          viduals to avoid disrupting operations or compromising safety. Provisions for controlled,
          authorized entry and the ability to close off access should be considered.
       3.3.1.2.5. Environmental, Cultural, and Natural Resource Factors.
          3.3.1.2.5.1. Shipping lanes and commercial fishing areas. The Corps of Engineers, the
          National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Coast Guard can help in identifying these
          areas.
          3.3.1.2.5.2. Agricultural areas, timber lands, grazing lands, and fish and wildlife pre-
          serves. The unit civil engineering or the environmental management offices can help with
          information on these areas.
24                                                        AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005


                3.3.1.2.5.3. Major highways and waterways; national, state, and local parks; national
                sanctuaries and seashores; Wilderness and Wilderness Study Areas; Native American Res-
                ervations and sacred areas; and established communities, schools, churches, cemeteries,
                historical and archaeological sites. These can be identified from various maps and docu-
                ments commonly available. The unit civil engineering and environmental management
                offices can help with this information. In addition, the State Historic Preservation Office,
                the National Park Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the US Forest Ser-
                vice have databases on these areas.
                3.3.1.2.5.4. Location of government owned or controlled lands and lands containing sub-
                stantial quantities of minerals, gas, oil, or other essential raw materials. Federal and state
                governments publish this type of information. The Bureau of Land Management is the
                agency responsible for these areas on federal land.
                3.3.1.2.5.5. There are various computer Geographic Information System (GIS) databases.
                They exist on the Internet or through MAJCOM (ACC/DOR and CEV) and Air Staff
                (USAF/XOOR) sources where information on many of these factors can be obtained. Con-
                tact the unit civil engineering or range office for guidance on accessing these databases.
     3.3.2. Develop a Public Affairs Program. Today, almost any action proposed by the military is consid-
     ered newsworthy and will attract both proponents and opponents. Therefore, it behooves the smart
     planner to solicit the cooperation and advice of Public Affairs personnel during all aspects of the plan-
     ning process. The Public Affairs office will assist in developing a cohesive, coordinated plan to
     present to the public. Public Affairs in concert with the proponent should serve as the focal point for
     the release of information to the public. The proponent needs to keep Public Affairs personnel
     apprised of the status of the proposal and provide definitive guidance as to what should and should not
     be discussed. Additionally, all proponents are required to have successfully completed a MAJCOM
     Public Affairs-approved risk communication seminar before they present proposals publicly.
     3.3.3. Comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).
        3.3.3.1. NEPA, and Categorical Exclusions (CATEX), Environmental Assessment (EA) or Envi-
        ronmental Impact Statement (EIS). An important part of the proposal development process is the
        National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). NEPA requires proponents for all major fed-
        eral projects to consider environmental impacts. It is important to note that when choosing an
        alternative, NEPA does not require that the decision-maker choose the most environmentally
        advantageous alternative. However, NEPA does require the decision-maker to make an informed
        decision and consider all potential impacts. The DOPAA is used as the basis for analysis under the
        USAF Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP). AFI 32-7061 contains policies, responsi-
        bilities, and procedures for the EIAP in the continental United States and its territories and posses-
        sions. AFI 32-7061 also addresses the EIAP at non-United States overseas locations. In summary,
        NEPA is a deliberate planning process designed to improve the decision making process for major
        federal actions. Below are the three major categories of analysis required by NEPA.
            3.3.3.1.1. Categorical Exclusions (CATEX). CATEXs apply to those classes of actions that
            individually or cumulatively do not have significant impact on the environment, and therefore,
            do not require further environmental analysis in an EA or an EIS. The approved list of USAF
            CATEXs is in AFI 32-7061. CATEXs apply to actions in the United States and abroad. Gen-
            eral exemptions specific to actions abroad are in DoD Directive 6050.7, Environmental Effects
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                      25


         Abroad of Major Department of Defense Actions. All actions that may be CATEXed still
         require the preparation of a T/TSNS.
         3.3.3.1.2. Environmental Assessment (EA). When a proposed action is one not requiring an
         EIS but is not categorically excluded, the Environmental Planning Function (EPF) must pre-
         pare an EA (Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, [sect] 1508.9, Environmental Assessment).
         Every EA must lead to either a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), a decision to pre-
         pare an EIS, or no decision on the proposal. An EA is a written analysis that provides informa-
         tion to determine whether to prepare an EIS or a FONSI, and aids the Air Force in complying
         with NEPA when an EIS is not required. EAs normally take from 6-12 months to execute.
         Details on EAs are in AFI 32-7061.
         3.3.3.1.3. Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Certain classes of environmental impacts
         require preparation of an EIS (Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1502, Environmen-
         tal Impact Statement). These include, but are not limited to: potential for significant degrada-
         tion of the environment; potential for significant threat or hazard to public health or safety; and
         substantial environmental controversy concerning the significance or nature of the environ-
         mental impact of a proposed action. The EIS is a very complicated process and starts with a
         Notice of Intent in the Federal Register, followed by: Public Scoping, Draft EIS, Public
         Review of Draft EIS, Response to Comments, Final EIS, Record of Decision, and Mitigation,
         as required. EISs normally take 18 to 24 months to complete. Details on EISs are in AFI
         32-7061.
  3.3.4. Early Identification of Funding Needs. Any information, gathered during the planning process,
  is used to refine cost estimates. Real estate, facilities, equipment, construction, and environmental
  mitigation each contribute significantly to overall cost. Other significant costs may be incurred if
  roads, high voltage transmission lines, pipelines, or other items need to be relocated and/or if unex-
  ploded ordnance removal and historical preservation is required. Deriving a cost estimate early is
  important in order to get the funding process started.
     3.3.4.1. Program Objective Memorandum (POM) Input. Land, equipment, construction, National
     Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance, and all other assets needed to get a range built and
     in sustainable operation require funds from different appropriations accounts: O&M—Air Force
     (3400); RDT&E—Air Force (3600); Military Construction—Air Force (3300); Military Personnel
     (MILPERS)—Air Force (3500); Other Procurement—Air Force (3080); and others. The range
     requirements compete with other MAJCOM requirements for funding. Therefore, the POM input
     must be justified and impacts of not funding the proposal need to be articulated. When justifying
     the need, seek to show return on the investment or attempt to quantify the proposal's contribution
     to combat readiness or test objectives.
  3.3.5. Plan For Staffing. Staffing for the range should be included as part of the overall package when
  it is put forward for budget consideration. Contracting for range operation and maintenance can wait
  until after range construction, as the lead-time to let a contract will normally be less than two years.
  The cost of the first year contract should be included as part of the start-up cost of the range.
  3.3.6. Classified Initiatives. Occasionally, there is a need to begin range planning for aircraft bed-
  down, new weapon systems, or other issues that are classified. MAJCOMs will assign a single
  point-of-contact to provide guidance to impacted units for these activities, and will designate spokes-
  person(s) to respond to inquiries from external sources, such as the media or the public. Any proposed
26                                                         AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005


     information release must be approved by the point-of-contact before it is made available to all desig-
     nated spokespersons. The point-of-contact should seek assistance from the Public Affairs office.

3.4. Airspace Establishment and Land Acquisition.
     3.4.1. Airspace. Before establishing a need for new airspace, proponents must ensure they comply
     with AFI 13-201, Air Force Airspace Management, AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis
     Process, and applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Directives, which require a review of
     existing airspace to determine if the proposed action can be “accommodated within or by modifying
     existing areas.” FAA Directives also require that the military accommodate the maximum number of
     operations in existing airspace and limit the proliferation of new airspace. If after reviewing existing
     airspace, the need still can not be accommodated, then proponents will initiate the EIAP and work
     with the Unit/MAJCOM Airspace Manager and AFREP to secure the necessary charted airspace. Pro-
     ponents will ensure they have FAA approval of the airspace before initiating a fee purchase, lease, or
     purchase of an easement of real estate.
     3.4.2. Land. Land acquisitions require lead times as long as 5-7 years. Proponents need to work with
     the Unit/MAJCOM, SAF/MII, and the AF Real Estate Agency (AFREA/DR) for land acquisitions.
     Factors to be examined when considering the acquisition of land include: confirmation that the pro-
     posal can not be accommodated within or by modifying existing areas, and issues associated with pro-
     curing private land or withdrawing federal lands. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of
     1976, and Title 43, United States Code, Section 155-158, Engle Act, require Congressional approval
     for any public land withdrawal, reservation, or restriction of over 5000 acres for any DoD project or
     facility. In addition, proponents need to prepare an Environmental Baseline Survey (EBS) for land
     acquisitions IAW AFI 32-7066, Environmental Baseline Surveys in Real Estate Transactions.
     3.4.3. Funding. If funding for range real estate is received in one allotment, acquisition for all lands
     should proceed immediately. If funds are received in increments, over multiple budget cycles, acqui-
     sition should proceed according to a plan that will allow an initial operational capability at the earliest
     date. For example, a range complex consisting of a Service Class A and two Service Class C tactical
     range areas can be acquired in three increments. Funds from the first increment should be used to
     acquire lands providing the highest benefit to the Air Force. Each increment should provide an opera-
     tional capability of its own.
     3.4.4. Cooperation with Other Agencies. Agreements with other federal, state, local, and tribal gov-
     ernment agencies should be finalized and signed during the acquisition phase. In some locations,
     USAF ranges require liaison and cooperation with many agencies in connection with livestock man-
     agement, fish and wildlife conservation, forest management, immigration and border control, irriga-
     tion development, etc. It is important that any issues impacting operations or safety be settled before
     the range activation date. Base commanders having parent command jurisdiction of an Air Force
     range must investigate and ensure liaison and cooperation with appropriate agencies of federal, state,
     local, and tribal governments. Refer to AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources Management, for
     the requirements. Coordination IAW Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal
     Programs, July 14, 1982, is required for any actions that might influence another agency's plans, pro-
     grams, or projects.

3.5. Combat Training Range (CTR) Executive Reviews. HQ ACC/DOR, with the assistance of AF/
XOOR, SAF/AQPS, AAC/WMR and OO-ALC/LHR, will conduct semi-annual executive-level reviews
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                       27


of all CTR programs covered by Program Management Directive (PMD) 0111(33)/PE 0604735F/
0207429F. The following commands or organizations will send senior representatives (normally O-6/vot-
ing members) to the CTR Executive Reviews: ACC, AETC, AFRC, ANG, PACAF, and USAFE. HQ
USAF/XOOR, AAC/WMR, OO-ALC/LHR, and SAF/AQPS are all non-voting members of the CTR
Executive Reviews. The purpose of the CTR Executive Reviews is to discuss ongoing programs, advo-
cate new requirements, and vote on funding priorities. The voting members of the CTR Executive
Reviews (as delegated by their parent MAJCOMs) have approval authority on CTR funding allocations
and program validation. They also provide requirements direction to AAC/WMR, SAF/AQPS, and
OO-ALC/LHR. ACC/DOR, in conjunction with the user, AAC/WMR, and OO-ALC/LHR prepares the
necessary requirements documentation to implement user prioritized programs. Day-to-day "user" man-
agement of CTR programs is the responsibility of ACC/DOR per the Four-Command Agreement and the
"total force" concept.
   3.5.1. CTR Program/Procurement of Instrumentation, Threat Systems, and Test/Training Range
   Engineering Development. CTRs need improvements to increase combat realism, to aid in developing
   tactics, and to enhance day-to-day training. This includes realistic simulations of the projected threat
   environment, as well as instrumentation for: readiness training, Operational Test & Evaluation
   (OT&E), tactics development and evaluation, command and control, safety, and real-time flight mon-
   itoring. These systems provide precise monitoring, reconstruction, and debriefing of aircrews after
   single and multiple aircraft training missions, including reaction to air defense threats and live or sim-
   ulated ordnance exchanges. A continuous modernization program is required to ensure that CTRs
   meet these requirements.
   3.5.2. CAF Requirements. HQ ACC/DOR is the lead agency for CAF range improvement require-
   ments representing AETC, AFRC, ANG, PACAF, and USAFE. AMC and AFSOC will develop their
   own requirements. AFOTEC will coordinate on CAF requirements that need an OT&E input or have
   an impact on OT&E as well as Development Test and Evaluation (DT&E), Force Development Eval-
   uation (FDE), Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E), and Expeditionary Force Experiments (EFX). The
   members of the CTR Executive Reviews, AAC/WMR, OO-ALC/LHR, and the test community
   should attempt to combine requirements and form partnerships to seek procurement synergy.

3.6. Test Investment Planning and Programming (TIPP) Process. Test infrastructure is a key contrib-
utor to the test process. AFPD 99-1, Test and Evaluation Process states, “The Air Force will operate,
maintain, and improve T&E facilities, including the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) … to
support US Air Force, Department of Defense, and other valid user requirements. In addition, the Air
Force will continually evaluate test infrastructure requirements and capabilities to ensure essential Air
Force needs are met, and to avoid unnecessary duplication and expense of excess test resources.”
   3.6.1. TIPP is the process for planning and programming all investments in the Air Force's T&E
   infrastructure within the AF Improvement and Modernization (I&M) program elements (Major T&E
   Investment and Threat Simulator Development) and identifying potential joint Service investment for
   funding under the Central T&E Investment Program (CTEIP). The purpose of TIPP is to identify the
   most critical shortfalls in the T&E community, develop alternatives to solve them, and deliver a cor-
   porate investment plan for budgeting and funding through the Planning, Programming, and Budgeting
   System (PPBS). HQ AFMC/DO manages the Air Force TIPP process to identify test resource invest-
   ments needed to support military systems testing.
28                                                       AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005


     3.6.2. The TIPP process is how solutions to validated requirements are identified and constrained
     with fiscal reality into an affordable and executable investment plan. TIPP provides a systematic
     approach using a three-phase “strategy-to-task-to-need-to-solution” process to derive the most impor-
     tant Air Force T&E requirements.
        3.6.2.1. Strategy-to-Task: In the strategy-to-task phase, the T&E community synthesizes require-
        ments from the acquisition and technology communities to determine very general guidance
        regarding future T&E infrastructure requirements.
        3.6.2.2. Task-to-Need: The task-to-need phase develops actual T&E requirements (i.e., what
        T&E needs to accomplish its mission) with participation from the acquisition community to
        review the synthesized information from the “strategy-to-task” phase and determine T&E require-
        ments.
        3.6.2.3. Need-to-Solution: The need-to-solution phase starts with the input of T&E requirements
        and needs developed by the T&E and acquisition communities. T&E requirements are the tasks or
        capabilities needed to fulfill the T&E mission. This phase determines how those needs are solved.
        The needs may include required upgrades, necessary sustainment, or required new test technology.
        However, information provided by the “strategy-to-task” and “task-to-need” phases is fiscally
        unconstrained. The next step is developing the Annual Planning and Programming Guidance
        (APPG). The APPG places fiscal reality and business practices in the process for development of
        the near-term T&E Improvement and Modernization portfolio for input to the Program Objective
        Memorandum (POM). These constraints then provide criteria to determine the most important
        T&E needs balanced by fiscal considerations.

3.7. Inputs to the Unit Comprehensive Range Plan. The designated ROA prepares inputs to the unit
Comprehensive Range Plan. The goal is to enhance the compatibility of land and airspace uses and pro-
vide guidance on near and long-term needs. For new ranges, develop plan inputs before the range is oper-
ational and forward the documents to the parent MAJCOM for review/approval and forward to AF/
XOOR. Inputs to the unit Comprehensive Range Plan will address as a minimum: land; airspace; range
facilities; targets; instrumentation (including scoring devices); range operations; safety; environmental
factors; geography; local community and government use of adjacent land (regional development agree-
ments); legal liability; rehabilitation; range clearance/ decontamination; target lists; authorized ordnance;
weapon safety footprint analysis; and future plans or other actions that may have an impact on the range.
The inputs will include the following elements:
3.7. (ANG) Inputs to the Unit Comprehensive Range Plan. ANG Range Comprehensive Range Plans
will be updated and archived annually for an indefinite period of time.
     3.7.1. Range Operations. Describe the range and its capabilities. Use maps, diagrams, etc. Report on
     any MOAs with other USAF agencies, other Services, FAA, etc. and include a summary of the MOAs,
     review and expiration schedules, and signatories. Range budgets, facility upgrades, equipment, struc-
     tures, etc. should also be included. Document operational deficiencies in range area, targets, and air-
     space.
     3.7.2. Safety. Report on range access control procedures, joint use procedures, and document weapon
     safety footprint analysis and approval. Document any safety deficiencies.
     3.7.3. Environmental Factors. Provide a summary of all environmental factors on the range: range
     clearance; endangered species; emissions; air quality; noise; wetlands; water resources; coastal zones;
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                     29


   mineral resources; soil conservation; dual use programs such as grazing, timber, farming, hunting,
   fishing, and camping; hazardous waste; historical/archeological sites; wilderness areas; and flood
   plains. ROAs should reference and summarize source documents on the above topics and provide
   points-of-contact and locations for the sources (reference the Cultural, Environmental, Natural
   Resources plan developed by the unit’s Environmental Management function). Include a list of all
   environmental analysis performed on the range and associated airspace, with result, date signed, and
   location of full document. Document any noise sensitive areas, seasonal restrictions from environ-
   mental actions, etc. If environmental analysis indicates a release or substantial threat of a release of
   munitions constituents from an active or inactive range to an off-range area, and the release poses an
   imminent and substantial threat to human health or the environment, respond in accordance with
   DoD’s explosives safety authority under 10 U.S.C. 172 as implemented in DoD Directive 6055.9,
   DoD Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) and DoD Component Explosives Safety Responsibilities, and
   DoD 6055.9-STD, DoD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards, and IAW response authorities

   ROAs should predict airspace/range issues in the near-term (three to five years) and propose a coordi-
   nated plan to address the required airspace/range modifications.
   3.7.6. UXO/Range Decontamination. Include a plan for life cycle management of UXO and range
   residue. Discuss procedures on how targets are located to minimize periodic range clearance costs and
   final clearance costs. Ensure no deviation from these procedures until a new plan is approved by
   MAJCOM and reviewed by HQ USAF/XOOR.

       RANGE OPERATIONS, RANGE PERSONNEL TRAINING, AND RANGE SAFETY

4.1. Range Operations. Range operations will be IAW this instruction, AFI-11-214, Aircrew, Weapons
Director, and Terminal Attack Controller Procedures for Air Operations, ACCR 55-26, Joint Live Fire
Training Operations, T.O. 1-1M-34, Aircrew Weapons Delivery Manual, T.O. 1-1M-34-1, Aircrew Weap-
ons Delivery Manual (classified), aircraft specific weapons delivery T.O.s, aircraft specific AFI 11-XXX
series, and Air Force Weapons School (AFWS) instructional texts. For MRTFBs additional range
resource management will be IAW DoD Directive 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base
(MRTFB).
4.1. (ANG) Range Operations. RCOs must be familiar with Joint Publication (JP) 3-09, Doctrine for
Joint Fire Support, JP 3-09.1, Joint Laser Designation, and JP 3-09.3 to ensure range procedures are com-
patible and consistent with appropriate operational doctrine.
     4.1.1. Use of Other Ranges.
     4.1.1. (ANG) ANG ranges will support day and night operational requirements.
        4.1.1.1. Other Service Ranges. Either this instruction or the operating Service procedures, which-
        ever is more restrictive, govern USAF operations on ranges operated by other Services. When
        using other Service ranges it is essential that all relevant weapon safety footprints be contained
        within the range boundaries. It is the range user's responsibility to obtain charts, range data, and
        flight information depicting the range boundaries and facilities to determine if the weapon safety
        footprints are contained within the range property. The range user must understand all risks asso-
        ciated with USAF operations on other Service ranges.
        4.1.1.2. Overseas Ranges Operated by a Host Nation. USAF operations on overseas ranges oper-
        ated by a host nation must comply with this instruction or the host nation’s procedures, whichever
        is more restrictive.
        4.1.1.3. Overseas Ranges Operated by USAF. Overseas ranges operated by USAF must comply
        with this instruction, DoD Directive 4715.12, Environmental and Explosives Safety Management
        on Department of Defense Active and Inactive Ranges Outside the United States, or host country
        guidance whichever is more restrictive. Overseas ROAs will develop theater MAJCOM approved
        supplements to this instruction, which govern USAF operations on host nation ranges. Supple-
        ments, at a minimum, will ensure compliance with USAF weapon and laser safety footprint
        requirements and have procedures in place to ensure the safety of personnel. Maintain close coor-
        dination with Department of State representatives in the host country and the theater joint staff. If
        the Corps of Engineers has a real estate representative serving in the host country concerned, that
        representative should assist in negotiating and drafting legal instruments.
        4.1.1.4. Strafe on Ranges not Meeting USAF Standards. Units desiring to strafe on ranges that do
        not comply with this instruction must request a waiver or an exemption, as appropriate, according
        to paragraph 1.6. The request must contain a full description of the range conditions and/or
        intended strafe technique that will minimize risk.
     4.1.2. Written Agreements for Ranges.
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                  33


  4.1.2. (ANG) Memorandums of Understanding, Host-Tenant Support Agreements and other formal
  agreements between ANG Units and other MAJCOMs/Services concerning range use will be for-
  warded to ANG/C4R for review.
     4.1.2.1. Written Agreements for Ranges. If a range is used regularly for initial or continuation
     training, written agreements must exist between a using MAJCOM and the operating agency of
     the range (another MAJCOM, Service, or nation). Limited use during exercises, deployments,
     evaluations, or inspections does not require written agreements, but the using unit must possess
     current range directives.
     4.1.2.2. Written Agreements to Support Foreign Users. These agreements include the Memoran-
     dum of Understanding (MOU), Letter of Agreement (LOA), Host-Tenant Support Agreement
     (HTSA), and Inter-service Support Agreement (ISA). Each signer ensures that these agreements
     meet the needs of the organization without compromising the mission and without placing the
     organization in an untenable position. Coordinate the draft agreement with the staff Judge Advo-
     cate General. Provide the ROA with a copy of each agreement impacting range operations or
     maintenance. The ROA should be familiar with these agreements and keep them readily available
     to the RCO during range operations. If a conflict arises regarding one of these agreements, the
     ROA should resolve the issue at the appropriate level.
     4.1.2.3. Memorandum of Understanding. A MOU is required for Air Force units to use weapons
     ranges belonging to another nation. Individual units normally author these MOUs. MAJCOM/FM,
     JA, and the State Department Mission in the host country review these MOUs for legal and finan-
     cial implications.
     4.1.2.4. Letter of Agreement. Use LOAs to specify procedures at the local level, such as those
     between the operating agency and the controlling agency of the local airspace.
     4.1.2.5. Host-Tenant Support Agreement and Inter-service Support Agreement. An HTSA or ISA
     is required IAW AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures, for Air Force units using weapons
     ranges belonging to other Services.
     4.1.2.5. (ANG) HTSA will be archived indefinitely.
  4.1.3. Joint and Shared Use of Ranges.
     4.1.3.1. Joint Use. USAF policy encourages joint use to maximize use of ranges and associated
     airspace. Ensuring public safety is critical with regard to joint use. When missions are not being
     flown, rangeland may be made available to authorized users for hunting, camping, etc. Live ord-
     nance areas and other areas where hazardous activities occur must remain closed to public access
     until they are decontaminated to the standard set in DoD 6055.9-STD, DoD Ammunition and
     Explosives Safety Standards, or other appropriate standards determined by the DoD Explosives
     Safety Board, or meet the criteria set in paragraph 4.3.16.2. When not needed, range airspace
     should be released to the controlling agency for use by non-participating aircraft. LOAs with the
     controlling agency must specify recall conditions to ensure that military mission requirements will
     be met.
     4.1.3.2. Shared Use. During range operations, activities such as grazing and crop cultivation can
     be allowed provided human access is prohibited in the Hazard Area. These activities must not
     impair range operations in any way.
34                                                       AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005


           4.1.3.2.1. Grazing Program. Grazing can be a complementary activity on USAF ranges. Pro-
           cedures for managing grazing programs are described in AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural
           Resources Management. The ROA will determine suitability and availability of grazing lands
           IAW AFI 32-7064. Grazing programs on Department of the Interior lands withdrawn for
           USAF uses are generally the responsibility of the Bureau of Land Management. In all cases,
           the ROA will ensure the appropriate agreements are in place to maximize shared use of the
           range. The agreement will ensure shared use does not adversely influence range operations,
           describe procedures to ensure public safety, and document agreements and agency responsibil-
           ities for the shared use. An Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan (INRMP) must be
           prepared for all ranges addressing all issues associated with natural resources.
           4.1.3.2.2. Other Commercial Activities. Air Force ranges may also offer other commercial
           uses such as timber management. Again, many of these programs are the responsibility of the
           Bureau of Land Management. The Minerals Management Service of the Department of Inte-
           rior manages the oil and gas exploitation on the Outer Continental Shelf applicable to USAF
           overwater ranges. The ROA will ensure the appropriate agreements are in place to maximize
           shared use of the range. The agreement will ensure shared use does not adversely impact test/
           training, describe procedures to ensure public safety, and document agreements and agency
           responsibilities for the shared use.
           4.1.3.2.3. Recreation and Education Programs. Many ranges encompass large airspace, land,
           or water areas and may contain significant natural resources, wild areas, historical sites, or
           archaeological sites. USAF, as custodian of this public property, has the responsibility to main-
           tain it in the best manner possible consistent with the military mission. The ROA will ensure
           agreements are in place to maximize the safe and appropriate shared use of the range. The
           agreement will ensure shared use does not adversely influence range operations, will describe
           procedures to ensure public safety, protect natural/cultural resources, and document agree-
           ments and agency responsibilities for oversight of the shared use. The INRMP will outline
           public access to natural resources. This plan is prepared in cooperation with the US Fish and
           Wildlife Service and the state fish and game agency. Additionally, the Cultural Resources
           Management Plan will manage and preserve sensitive areas while addressing public concerns.
     4.1.4. Night Operations. (N/A AFSOC)
        4.1.4.1. Night Range Operations. Night range operations present unique challenges to both the
        aircrew and the RCOs and will be conducted IAW AFI 11-214. Visual cues are greatly reduced,
        even with the use of Night Vision Devices (NVD). RCOs must be trained and certified to control
        missions with and without NVDs and must have a minimum of Generation III NVDs. Aircraft atti-
        tude and range are very difficult to determine at night, especially while using NVDs. If the RCO
        can not positively determine that the aircraft can release safely, the RCO will delegate ordnance
        release clearance to a qualified flight lead, individual pilot, FAC, or other briefed person, by
        declaring “Authorized (flight lead, individual pilot, FAC, etc.) Control.” In cases where the RCO
        delegates safe release of ordnance, the RCO will maintain overall authority on the range and can
        abort the release at any time, however, the pilot assumes sole responsibility for safe release of ord-
        nance. Additionally, a spectrum of targets should be provided ranging from well lit, easily identi-
        fied, conventional targets to unlit, realistic, tactical targets. Target arrays should be coordinated
        with the aircrew NVD upgrade program. Range NVDs must be adjusted in an NVD eye lane for
        optimum visual acuity. Re-adjust them at the range tower for maximum range.
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                    35


     4.1.4.1. (ANG) If the RCO cannot positively determine that aircraft parameters exist for safe ord-
     nance release, the RCO may delegate release authority to the flight lead, individual pilot, or FAC
     by declaring, "Authorized flight lead/FAC control". In cases where the RCO delegates release
     authority, the RCO retains authority to abort the pass or to take back clearance control at any time.
     At all times the RCO maintains overriding munitions release and abort authority on the range.
        4.1.4.1.1. Night Vision Devices. All Service Class A ranges must be equipped with NVDs
        that are binocular in design and have at least Generation III tubes. Range NVDs will be main-
        tained to the same standards as aircrew NVDs. MAJCOMs will approve RCO training in the
        use of NVDs. As a minimum, NVD training for RCOs should include: night range operations,
        human visual system, physiological issues, proper adjustment, care and use, NVD limitations,
        disorientation, and aircrew limitations. The range will be equipped with an eye lane for proper
        adjustment of NVDs.
        4.1.4.1.1. (ANG) The Night Vision Goggle computer based training (CBT) program will be
        successfully completed by all ANG Range personnel prior to use of NVDs and will be
        reviewed annually. This program is available through ANG/C4R.
        4.1.4.1.2. (Added-ANG) ANG target lighting will be a steady (not flashing, strobe, etc.) style
        light. Manned sights will be marked with flashing or strobe lights. Range boundaries, if
        marked, will also be marked with flashing or strobe lights.
     4.1.4.2. Range Lighting. Proper light management is essential for safe night range operations.
     This lighting falls under several categories such as: range identification lighting, target lighting,
     range tower lighting, aircraft lighting, and IR target pointers and/or lasers.
        4.1.4.2.1. Range Identification Lighting. For Service Class A ranges, a distinctive pattern of
        lights must be present to permit positive range and target orientation and identification. These
        lights must be of a type that will be visible for both “Aided” and “Un-aided” missions but
        should not interfere with weapons delivery by causing distraction or washing out the target
        locations. The pattern of these lights should be arranged in an easily identifiable, unique
        design. Ensure that no similar pattern of lights exists near range boundaries that could be mis-
        identified as targets or the Target Area. The light pattern will be published in the local supple-
        ment to this instruction and on the ROA’s homepage.
        4.1.4.2.2. Target Lighting. Target lighting may be accomplished using incandescent lights,
        lanterns, or flares. Lights and lanterns should be NVD compatible or reduced in intensity to
        produce the minimum halo around each light when viewed through NVDs. Every effort should
        be made to prevent the target from appearing as a light with a halo to allow positive target
        identification. Strafe target lighting should also avoid halo effects.
        4.1.4.2.3. Range Tower Lighting. Proper management of Service Class A range tower lighting
        is important to maximize performance of NVDs used by range personnel. Tower lights (inte-
        rior and exterior) should be minimized to reduce glare on the windows. Lighting on manned
        locations must facilitate positive identification by the aircrew. Ideally, lights necessary for
        operation should be replaced with lights that are compatible with NVDs. All unnecessary
        lights should be extinguished or taped over. Consider moving obstruction and strobe lights to
        locations that will best support night operations.
36                                                        AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005


            4.1.4.2.4. Aircraft Lighting. With RCO concurrence, all aircrews may use reduced or blacked
            out external lighting in restricted airspace IAW AFI 11-214 when conducting night range oper-
            ations, and the range is equipped for NVG use.
            4.1.4.2.5. IR Target Pointers and/or Lasers. IR target pointers may be used to help identify the
            location of range targets, the position of manned sites, or other locations. When using these
            pointers, be aware of the Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance (NOHD) and do not point the laser
            at unprotected personnel within the hazard zone. Additionally, a single IR target pointer will
            not be used as the sole source of target identification. When lasers are used to designate or
            mark targets, RCOs will prohibit attack headings within ± 10° of the laser designator to target
            line (safety zone) and will restrict aircraft target run-in headings to a 50° attack cone on either
            side of the safety zone. ROAs will publish the appropriate restrictions in their supplements to
            this instruction and will ensure that the range is certified for each laser use IAW this instruc-
            tion. Ensure that tactics are considered when evaluating the use of lasers.
            4.1.4.2.6. Other Control Methods. Other methods used to ensure safe night operations include
            but are not limited to: require a dry pass on the range to ensure positive identification of tar-
            gets; require a day mission prior to night use if the aircrew has never flown on the range; use
            of radar or other aids by the RCO to determine aircraft position; and determine a minimum
            illumination level depending on range terrain conditions. For RCO transfer of control proce-
            dures, refer to paragraph 4.1.4.1.
        4.1.4.3. Range Weather. Range weather restrictions for flight operations will be IAW AFI 11-214,
        MAJCOM, unit requirements, or specific range limits, whichever is more restrictive.
        4.1.4.4. Minimum Altitudes. Minimum altitudes during night surface attack missions are IAW
        AFI 11-214, MAJCOM requirements, the pilot’s NVD category, or the minimum altitudes allowed
        by actual illumination, whichever is higher.
     4.1.5. Air Force Range Certification/Evaluations for Laser Operations.
        4.1.5.1. Laser Operations. Before the ROA can authorize laser operations, the range must be cer-
        tified IAW AFOSH Standard 48-139, Laser Radiation Protection Program; ANSI Z136.1, Amer-
        ican National Standard for the Safe Use of Lasers; and MIL HDBK 828A, Laser Safety on Ranges
        and in Other Outdoor Areas. Range certification for laser operations is essential to range safety.
        Lasers can cause permanent eye damage or momentary vision loss, which could result in serious
        flight safety hazards.
        4.1.5.2. Laser Certification. The range commander makes a laser certification request through the
        MAJCOM to the Brooks AFB Optical Radiation Safety (ORS) Team, consisting of the Air Force
        Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the Air Force Institute for Environment, Safety, Occupational
        Health and Risk Assessment (AFIERA). An on-site evaluation to assess risks, hazards, and proce-
        dures for laser operations on the range will be completed and a report provided to the range com-
        mander, base bioenvironmental engineering, and MAJCOM. The goal of the survey is to ensure
        safe operation of lasers on the range while minimizing the impact of any restrictions on flight
        operations. Once the range’s laser safety program has met the recommendations of the report, it is
        certified for the laser operations evaluated in the report. As a minimum, evaluations will consist
        of:
            4.1.5.2.1. Preliminary data collection.
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                      37


        4.1.5.2.2. On site survey-verification of data (weapons, targets, and tactics).
        4.1.5.2.3. A final report that provides range specific, laser safety footprints, safety recommen-
        dations, and laser systems approved for use at that range.
     4.1.5.3. Range Certification Validity. Laser certification is required to conduct laser operations on
     ranges. This laser certification will remain valid for three years, as long as the laser type, aircraft
     or platform, weapons, targets, tactics, range boundary, and airspace do not change, and despecu-
     larization meets the requirements specified in paragraph 4.1.5.4.
        4.1.5.3.1. After initial certification, the Unit Safety Officer (USO) or designated Laser Safety
        Officer (LSO) will conduct a range survey status review and evaluate laser operations on the
        range annually. The Brooks ORS TEAM will provide the format for this report and it will be
        documented and reported to the MAJCOM (or equivalent) and the Brooks ORS Team. This
        report is essential to the continued certification of the range. The range will be decertified for
        laser operations if the report is not received within 45 days of the expiration of the annual
        reporting period and can only be re-certified by the MAJCOM (or equivalent) and the Brooks
        ORS Team.
        4.1.5.3.2. (Added-ANG) An Laser Safety Officer (LSO) will be present during any opera-
        tion/mission employing lasers (emitting ocular and/or skin hazard) or IR pointers.
     4.1.5.4. Range Laser Operations. The ROA must publish or reference all laser-operating proce-
     dures in the local supplement to this instruction. The director of Base Medical Services must be
     notified of the specific type of laser activity that will occur on the range. Range personnel must
     have a baseline eye exam before working in the laser hazard environment. All range personnel
     working within the Laser Surface Danger Zone (LSDZ) must wear laser safety goggles of appro-
     priate optical density. A periodic despecularization of the LSDZ surrounding the targets must be
     accomplished IAW MIL HDBK 828A. Lasers must not be operated without the approval of the
     USO or designated LSO and the RCO. The RCO will be notified and approve use of a laser when
     it is initially turned on and will acknowledge notification by the user that the laser is turned off
     upon completion of laser activity. The RCO will record the start and stop times of lasing periods.
     4.1.5.4. (ANG) ANG ranges will not allow use of a single source pointer/marker/laser as the sole
     method to identify or mark targets.
     4.1.5.5. Ground Lasers. Ground laser designator or illuminator operators will comply with the
     requirements of this instruction. The USO, designated LSO, or RCO will be notified when ground
     personnel such as Tactical Air Control Parties or Special Operations Forces conduct laser opera-
     tions on the range. Ground lasers will not be directed at targets or Target Areas where the laser
     beam will terminate beyond the range boundary.
     4.1.5.6. Laser Injury Reporting. Injury reporting will be IAW AFOSH Standard 48-139.
  4.1.6. Communication Requirements.
     4.1.6.1. General Requirements. The operating agency must supply specific requirements and the
     concept of operation to the base communications officer in order to plan the desired communica-
     tion facilities. Consider AFPD 33-1, Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4)
     Systems during the planning and programming of communications and electronic systems. The
     exact communication facilities for each range may vary, depending on Class of Service (A, B, C,
38                                                   AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005


     or D), location, operating conditions, usage, etc. Two general categories of communication facili-
     ties will suffice for all ranges as follows:
        4.1.6.1.1. Point-to-point (ground) communications are required between the range (Service
        Class A or B), the parent or using base, and among the various agencies on the range. The
        point-to-point communications are usually telephone systems, although radio or microwave
        may be necessary in isolated locations. The range control tower must be able to communicate
        with the flank towers and operations buildings by means of telephone or radio systems.
        Backup communications (Service Class A) between towers rely on intra-base radios, which
        may be either the portable or porta-mobile type. Intra-base radios are used to maintain contact
        with maintenance personnel operating in the Target Area.
        4.1.6.1.2. Ground-to-air communications are required to control aircraft on the range. The
        ground-to-air communications are usually ultra high frequency (UHF) radios since this is the
        type most often found in USAF aircraft. Very high frequency (VHF), frequency modulation
        (FM), or amplitude modulation (AM) radios are authorized at ranges where aircraft regularly
        using the range are equipped with VHF, FM, or AM radios. On Service Class A ranges, a com-
        plete UHF and/or VHF backup capability is required to avoid any loss of range missions
        because of radio failure. Service Class B ranges, if staffed, must have the capability to commu-
        nicate with the aircraft to provide scores; however, a backup capability is not required. No
        radios are required on Class C ranges.
        4.1.6.1.2. (ANG) Range Control Officers will monitor guard frequencies and will transmit on
        UHF/VHF guard frequencies as appropriate.
            4.1.6.1.2.1. (Added-ANG) The RCO will ensure that all air-to-ground and ground-to-air
            communications recorders are working properly. Each recording will contain the range
            name, date, and time. Recordings containing records of any range incident will be kept and
            secured until released by the investigating agency.
            4.1.6.1.2.2. (Added-ANG) All aircraft utilizing the range will monitor UHF Guard fre-
            quency.
            4.1.6.1.2.3. (Added-ANG) Aircraft using UHF, VHF or Fm radios on the range will be on
            range assigned UHF/VHF or FM frequencies.
     4.1.6.2. Additional Service Class A Communication Requirements. On Service Class A ranges,
     communications between flank towers and the control tower must be operational at all times and
     have a backup capability. In addition, all maintenance crews, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
     teams, and visitor escorts must maintain two-way communications with the range control tower,
     range office, or parent base while working on the range.
     4.1.6.3. Communication Operations. As part of their normal duties, the range crews will operate
     all communications equipment used on Class A and B ranges. There is no need to assign commu-
     nications personnel as radio operators, unless special conditions warrant this particular Air Force
     Specialty Code for a given range. The following additional guidance also applies:
        4.1.6.3.1. Night Communications. In-flight range operations will be conducted on the fre-
        quency assigned to the range for communication between the RCO and range users. Standard
        terminology and monitoring of the inter-flight frequency by the RCO increases the flight and
        RCO’s situational awareness and helps reduce the possibility of weapons delivery mishaps.
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                      39


   4.1.7. Range Operations Support.
   4.1.7. (ANG) ANG Ranges support both day and night operations.
      4.1.7.1. Supply. Obtain needed parts or replacements through normal supply procedures. The
      ROA should establish procedures with the parent supply organization to obtain materials for range
      operations, as well as salvage and disposal. When the distance between the parent base supply
      organization and the range is great, establish a separate supply section at the range to administer
      all supply activities.
      4.1.7.2. Vehicles. The vehicles and heavy equipment necessary to operate and maintain a range
      will vary based upon type, number and Class of range; terrain, vegetation, soil composition and
      climate; distance from parent base; and availability of commercial power. Use of GFE vehicles in
      contract operations should be kept to a minimum per AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, and Federal
      Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 45:45.304, Providing Motor Vehicles. The ROA will appoint a
      vehicle control officer or Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) to manage vehicle operations and
      responsibilities IAW AFI 24-301. The contractor is responsible for supply and maintenance sup-
      port for contractor-provided vehicles. Vehicles and equipment may be obtained from the Defense
      Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO) to fulfill contractual requirements. The contractor may
      provide maintenance for these items and parts may be obtained locally with range reimbursable
      funds. Consistent with AFI 24-301 and FAR Part 45:45.304, existing special use vehicles once
      provided GFE will be “laid in” (as authorized by MAJCOM/LG) to meet range vehicle require-
      ments. Any subsequent need for vehicles to meet contractual requirements will be the responsibil-
      ity of the range O&M contractor.
      4.1.7.2. (ANG) Some Ranges, which are geographically separated from their host unit, must
      complete range vehicle and equipment maintenance functions.
      4.1.7.3. Utilities. The ROA is responsible for providing all utilities required in support of range
      operations. Commercially provided services should be used when available and expedient.
      4.1.7.3. (ANG) All ranges will maintain emergency generators sufficient to operate all utilities
      required for flight operations in the event of commercial power outage.

4.2. Range Personnel and Training.
   4.2.1. Range Personnel Training. The ROA will establish a training program for all personnel
   assigned to a range IAW MAJCOM supplements. The ROA will annually review all training records.
   See Attachment 2 for a general guide for range personnel training requirements.
   4.2.2. Additional Range Personnel. Other personnel may be needed to maintain and construct targets,
   man scoring towers, provide fire fighting support, provide law enforcement, maintain roads, maintain
   radios, maintain range scoring equipment, and operate/maintain threat simulators. EOD personnel
   will periodically be required to supervise, perform, and certify range residue is free of energetic mate-
   rial during clearance operations. Specific military manpower requirements for range personnel will be
   IAW applicable MAJCOM or equivalent manpower instructions/standards. The number of personnel
   required for contract duties will be as required to meet contract Statements of Work, specifications,
   and military directives and instructions.

4.3. Range Safety.
     4.3.1. ROAs will ensure weapon safety footprints exist for all aircraft, weapons, and tactics (includ-
     ing other Services and countries) authorized for a given target and event on the range. Otherwise,
     weapons employment is prohibited. For PTRs, training weapon safety footprints must exist before the
     ROA authorizes operations on the range. For MRTFBs, either training weapon safety footprints or
     approved test weapon safety footprints and a safety risk analysis must exist before the ROA authorizes
     operations on the range. TEST WEAPON SAFETY FOOTPRINTS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED FOR
     TRAINING IF THERE IS AN APPROVED TRAINING WEAPON SAFETY FOOTPRINT. The
     ROA will analyze each target on the range using the applicable test or training weapon safety foot-
     prints.
     4.3.1. (ANG) Applies to all ANG Weapons Ranges.
     4.3.2. Test Weapon Safety Footprint Methodology. On-range “containment” of a weapon systems
     performance envelope, impact footprint and/or associated debris fields requires the surface area (land
     or sea) to be protected by purchase, lease, or other restriction. This general policy ensures safety will
     be maximized consistent with mission requirements. However if the weapon platform’s technical
     characteristics exceed the ability to “contain” everything within a designated surface area, a risk man-
     agement policy may be used if authorized by the Range Commander. The Range Operating Agency
     (ROA) will perform a risk assessment study to identify and control hazards. This risk assessment will
     establish mission parameters to minimize potential safety hazards associated with weapon employ-
     ment.
        4.3.2.1. Risk Management. Ensure Compliance with Range Commanders Council (RCC) Stan-
        dard 321-97, (Common Risk Criteria for National Test Ranges) for performing a risk assessment
        study. Risk management is a systematic and logical process to identify and control hazards. This
        process includes any or all of the following steps: 1) identify the hazards, 2) define hazard levels,
        3) define risks, 4) define and implement risk reduction measures, 5) obtain approval from proper
        authority, and 6) ultimately accept the hazard or risk.
        4.3.2.2. Ensure Compliance with Range Commanders Council (RCC) Standard 321-97 for inert
        debris. This guidance provides levels of protection for each individual (individual risk), and
        acceptable risk limits for decision-makers and the overall mission (collective risk).
     4.3.3. SAFE-RANGE Program Methodology and Training Weapon Safety Footprints. See AFI
     13-212, Volume 3 for detailed explanation of the step-by-step procedures of the SAFE-RANGE Pro-
     gram methodology, and the development process for training weapon safety footprints and their appli-
     cation using the SAFE-RANGE Program.
     4.3.3. (ANG) SAFE-RANGE. All ANG Ranges will comply with SAFE-RANGE.
        4.3.3.1. Background. The principle objective of the SAFE-RANGE Program methodology is to
        assist the ROA in promoting safe range operations. SAFE-RANGE Program methodology identi-
        fies weapons impact point probabilities from a variety of platforms and parameters thus providing
        the ROA with a scientific basis for making sound range planning and operational decisions.
        4.3.3.2. SAFE-RANGE Program Methodology. SAFE-RANGE Program methodology allows the
        ROA to identify possible target locations; modify allowable delivery ground tracks to eliminate or
        reduce hazards; identify the best location for range improvements; or design a new Target Area/
        range. The methodology is based on weapon safety footprints developed from a combination of
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                    41


     actual weapon impact data and simulation results. A weapon safety footprint defines the minimum
     land required to employ a given munition safely, using a certain aircraft and delivery tactic, over a
     specific soil density and target type. Each weapon safety footprint incorporates a probability dis-
     tribution function (pdf) which provides the information necessary to perform a quantitative risk
     assessment and evaluate the relative risk of an identified hazard.
     4.3.3.3. Training Weapon Safety Footprints. HQ ACC/DOR is the USAF executive agent for pro-
     curing and modifying training weapon safety footprints. MAJCOMs shall fund their command
     unique SAFE-RANGE requirements and/or any costs for software licenses and equipment. If a
     specific weapon safety footprint, aircraft, and/or tactic combination does not have a validated
     training weapon safety footprint, that weapon, aircraft, and/or tactic combination is not authorized
     for employment by the training community.
         4.3.3.3.1. Authorizations/Restrictions. Authorizations and restrictions will be published in the
         ROA’s local range supplement. ACC is designated as the lead command/executive agent for
         training weapon safety footprint development, but not for test weapon safety footprint devel-
         opment for AFMC MRTFBs. MAJCOMs will coordinate with ACC/DOR for training weapon
         safety footprint requirements and future development.
         4.3.3.3.2. SAFE-RANGE Program Computer Support. MAJCOMs will ensure each ROA has
         sufficient computer hardware, software, and Internet capability to operate and support the
         SAFE-RANGE Program.
  4.3.4. Weapon Safety Footprint Application Policy. Weapon safety footprints will be applied to each
  target on the range. ROAs will maintain a record (electronic or hard copy) of the analysis (to include
  approved ordnance, deliveries, and run-in restrictions) in the local range supplement to this instruc-
  tion. The weapon safety footprints define the Hazard Area around a target. Access is not authorized to
  the Hazard Area for a particular target when that target is in use.
  4.3.5. New Weapons, Aircraft, Training Requirements. The Air Force must develop test and training
  weapon safety footprints as new weapons, aircraft, and employment tactics are developed and enter
  the operational inventory. Appropriate MAJCOMs will ensure training weapon safety footprints are
  available prior to levying new weapons training requirements or introducing new aircraft and weap-
  ons into the USAF inventory.
  4.3.6. Use of Live Ordnance. Before a range is authorized for live ordnance use, the ROA must
  accomplish a T/TSNS and with the approval and assistance of the MAJCOM, and in coordination
  with the parent range, will comply with the Environmental Impact Analysis Process. The ROA will
  ensure weapon safety footprints are analyzed before designating specific targets for live ordnance
  employment. Aircraft with free-falling and/or forward-firing ordnance will not over fly or point their
  guns at manned sites with intent to expend or employ weapons. Aircraft with moveable guns, such as
  helicopters and AC-130 Gunships, must not point their guns at any manned site. Facilities where the
  risk of damage is deemed unacceptable must not be within the weapon safety footprint and/or weapon
  fragmentation pattern. For day-to-day operations, the RCO (or delegated flight lead, individual pilot,
  FAC, or other briefed person) is the approval authority for employment of live ordnance.
  4.3.7. Range Operations Near Manned Equipment and Facilities. Manned equipment and facilities,
  such as range towers and simulated threat emitters, may be located within the Hazard Area during
  range operations, provided training ordnance is used and an operational risk analysis was conducted
  and approved by the ROA. At a minimum, the analysis will include a SAFE-RANGE Program meth-
42                                                        AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005


     odology IAW AFI 13-212, Volume 3 to assess the risk. The ROA must approve each proposal in writ-
     ing. The ROA may delegate approval authority for short notice, temporary locations known to be in a
     low risk area. However, each location authorized by the delegated approver will be for one-time use
     only. Additional requests must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis and approved by the ROA.
     4.3.8. Depleted Uranium (DU). Use of DU on a US government owned and operated range requires a
     license granted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (See Chapter 8 for an expanded DU policy).
     HQ USAF/XO must approve use of DU ammunition on Air Force ranges. Limit the use of DU to that
     necessary to maintain readiness. Restrict the use of DU to specifically designated Nuclear Regulatory
     Commission (NRC) licensed Target Areas. Do not use live, full-scale munitions (this does not pre-
     clude Combat Mix) in a DU Target Area.
     4.3.8. (ANG) DU and Cluster Bomb Units (CBU) are not authorized for use on any ANG range.
     4.3.9. Supersonic Flight in Range Airspace. Supersonic flight over land is prohibited below 30,000
     feet MSL (below 10,000 feet MSL over water and less than 15 NM from land), except where specifi-
     cally authorized. Refer to AFI 13-201, Air Force Airspace Management, for further guidance on how
     to obtain a supersonic waiver. Overseas locations will obtain host nation approval as required.
     Approval for supersonic flight in range airspace, even above 30,000 feet MSL over land (above
     10,000 feet MSL over water and greater than 15 NM from land) requires as a minimum a T/TSNS
     approved by the MAJCOM/DO (submit information copies to HQ USAF XOOR and ILEV).
     4.3.9. (ANG) Also submit an AF Information Management Tool (IMT) 813, Request for Environ-
     mental Impact Analysis.
     4.3.10. Self-protection Flare and Chaff Use. Flares will be employed IAW AFI 11-214 and/or specific
     range guidance, whichever is more restrictive. Chaff will be employed IAW CJCSM 3212.02, Per-
     forming Electronic Attack in the United States and Canada for Tests, Training and Exercises, and/or
     specific range guidance, whichever is more restrictive. This guidance assumes use of current inven-
     tory flares and chaff, and an adequate environmental assessment of action. Any flare or chaff car-
     tridges having significantly different characteristics (pyrophoric flares or double squibbed chaff) may
     be expended during authorized T&E activities until their use is authorized by the appropriate MAJ-
     COM.
     4.3.11. Armament Safety Procedures. Prior to first release when carrying expendable ordnance (live,
     inert, or training), final switch configuration for weapon release will not be accomplished until the air-
     craft is in such a position that any accidental release will be contained within the range. MAJCOMs
     will develop specific guidance for armament system configurations for multiple passes. After com-
     pleting final weapons delivery, each flight member will perform a weapons system safety check. Refer
     to AFI 11-214, aircraft specific AFI 11-XXX series operating procedures, and individual range sup-
     plements for additional guidance.
     4.3.11. (ANG) ANG ranges will develop and publish local armament safety procedures in their local
     supplement to AFI 13-212, Volumes I-III.
     4.3.12. Emergency Jettison Areas. All ranges must have an area designated for jettison of ordnance,
     external fuel tanks, towed targets etc. Jettison areas will be located such that maximum protection is
     provided to ground personnel in case the jettisoned ordnance detonates.
     4.3.12. (ANG) ANG ranges will develop and publish local emergency jettison procedures in their
     local supplement to AFI 13-212, Volumes I-III.
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                      43


  4.3.13. Range Demonstrations and Visitor Procedures. These events educate observers about Air
  Force capabilities. Staging these events presents additional concerns for safety. Each ROA must pub-
  lish or reference procedures in their local range supplement to ensure positive control of all spectators.
  Visitor locations must be analyzed using the SAFE-RANGE Program to ensure that spectators are not
  within the Hazard Area during operations. The ROA will have control in those limited cases where
  DoD personnel or contractors must be within the Hazard Area during operations to accomplish a spe-
  cific mission-related task. Waiver requests will be IAW paragraph 1.6.
  4.3.14. Flight Safety.
     4.3.14.1. Activation of Airspace. The RCO will activate range airspace with the local Air Traffic
     Control (ATC) facility or Air Traffic representative IAW local agreements between the ROA and
     the controlling agency. The request for activation should be timed (before a scheduled mission) to
     allow shared or joint users to clear the area and for the controlling agency to make internal adjust-
     ments.
     4.3.14.2. Weather Observation. The RCO will monitor weather conditions and wind direction/
     velocity. The RCO will get current altimeter settings, temperature, and wind direction/velocity
     from the local base weather station, command post, Automated Surface Observing System
     (ASOS), or ATC agency at least hourly, if the capability is not available at the range. The local
     weather detachment or command post should advise the RCO of any sudden adverse weather
     changes that might impact range operations or safety.
     4.3.14.3. Range Restricted Area—Community Relations. To maximize safety on and around
     ranges, the ROA must engage in an active and comprehensive public outreach program. This can
     include attendance at public governmental meetings, community briefings, establishment of com-
     munity advisory groups, etc. However, all such public programs will be coordinated through the
     unit’s public affairs and legal offices. ROAs will follow guidance published in AFI 13-201 and
     include information on the hazardous operations associated with range activities as well as the
     dangers to non-participating aircraft. The RCO and/or flight-lead are responsible for enforcing
     safe operating procedures during range operations.
     4.3.14.4. Aircraft Accident Procedures. In case of an aircraft crash during Service Class A range
     operations, the RCO will initiate all necessary emergency actions. These include appropriate noti-
     fications, closing of the range, and assuming responsibility as the interim on-scene commander
     until the crash response team can be organized. During Service Class B and C range operations,
     the flight lead, individual pilot, FAC, or other briefed person will start the emergency actions, and
     if feasible, act as the interim on scene-commander. Investigations will be conducted IAW AFI
     91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
     4.3.14.4. (ANG) The ROA will be the approving authority for resuming range operations follow-
     ing an aircraft accident involving range operations.
  4.3.15. Ground and Explosive Safety.
     4.3.15.1. Ground and Explosive Safety. The ROA is responsible for establishing procedures for
     ground and explosive safety. In addition, the ROA must ensure public notices are published rela-
     tive to danger zones associated with ranges under the operating agency’s control.
     4.3.15.2. Hazard Notice. The ROA must ensure that hazard notices inform the local populace of
     hazards associated with trespassing on range property. Posted notices saying "Bombing Range" or
44                                                      AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005


        "Gunnery Range" must meet the requirements of AFI 31-209, The Air Force Resource Protection
        Program, and AFI 31-101, Volume 1, The Air Force Physical Security Program. MAJCOMs and
        ROAs are required to develop procedures for permitting/deconflicting ground party and non-mili-
        tary activities on the range.
        4.3.15.3. First Aid and Evacuation. There must be provisions for first aid as well as expeditious
        pickup and evacuation of aircrew members or range personnel injured during range operations.
        4.3.15.4. Fire Fighting Equipment. On Service Class A and staffed Service Class B ranges, appro-
        priate fire fighting equipment and personnel must be available to deal with local fire hazards. This
        capability may be provided through USAF, land owner, in-service civilian, or independent con-
        tractor assets, or through agreement with another government agency such as the Bureau of Land
        Management or US Forestry Service. Sufficient hand-operated fire fighting equipment must be
        assigned directly to the range for emergency use.
        4.3.15.5. Emergency Procedures. Emergency procedures for each range must be published in the
        local range supplement.
        4.3.15.6. Safety Briefing Requirements. The ROA or contractor will provide and document initial
        and yearly ground and explosive safety briefings to personnel assigned to operate and maintain
        Air Force ranges. Non-EOD personnel will receive appropriate training from EOD personnel
        before assisting in range clearance. Authorized visitors and personnel who infrequently visit the
        range must be briefed on range safety.
        4.3.15.7. Hazard Condition Watch. The RCO and all range personnel must continually watch for
        hazardous conditions such as trespassers, fires, abnormal bird activity, etc. Range users will be
        notified immediately of any hazardous conditions on the range. If safety is in question, the RCO
        will stop range operations until the situation is remedied.
     4.3.16. Range Access.
        4.3.16.1. Target Area Access. The Target Area is the area on a range complex that immediately
        surrounds the target or designated mean point of impact. Only authorized personnel will be
        allowed access to Target Areas. Public access to Target Areas is prohibited. The Target Area
        demarcation will be determined locally based on an Operational Risk Management (ORM) analy-
        sis IAW AFI 91-213, Operational Risk Management (ORM) Program. The ORM analysis exam-
        ines geographic features, frequency of EOD sweeps, type of ordnance authorized, employment
        tactics, and type of proposed joint or shared use. The Target Area demarcation should normally be
        no less than 1000 feet from the center of the target or designated mean point of impact. The ORM
        analysis is required for all new targets, and existing targets will be examined to determine if an
        ORM analysis is required. The ROA will certify that all Target Area access procedures and rules
        sufficiently protect all personnel and property.
 NOTE:
ORM is an interdisciplinary team approach to managing risk. ORM membership includes but is not lim-
ited to operations, civil engineering, environmental, legal, public affairs, safety, and EOD.
        4.3.16.2. Hazard Area Access. The Hazard Area is the area of a range defined by a composite of
        all weapon safety footprints for all authorized weapon delivery events, against targets located in
        the Target Areas. Access to Hazard Areas is not authorized when the range is in use, and must be
        positively controlled when the range is not in use. Unless authorized by the ROA, public access is
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                   45


     prohibited in Hazard Areas used for live munitions. All live munitions must be accounted for in a
     Hazard Area or a portion of a Hazard Area before public access is authorized. Access to Hazard
     Areas will be determined locally based on an ORM analysis that examines geographic features,
     frequency of EOD sweeps, types of ordnance authorized, employment tactics, and type of pro-
     posed joint or shared use. The ROA will certify that all Hazard Area access procedures and rules
     sufficiently protect all personnel and property. On ranges where Hazard Area access is controlled
     by another agency, it is the responsibility of the ROA to establish procedures to control access and
     inform that agency of potential hazards.
        4.3.16.2.1. Weapon Safety Footprint Area. A closed contour that defines the land area con-
        taining 99.99 percent (at a 95 percent confidence level) of all initial impacts and ricochets,
        resulting from the release of a specified weapon type during air-to-surface weapon delivery
        events.

                                                 Chapter 5

                        ELECTRONIC COMBAT TRAINING OPERATIONS

5.1. Electronic Combat Training Operations. This chapter provides general description, policies and
procedures for all Electronic Combat Ranges and Electronic Scoring Sites (ECRs/ESSs). The MAJCOMs
are responsible for establishing procedures and training principles used by Electronic Combat (EC) oper-
ations personnel. In cases where civilian contractors provide ECR/ESS operations, variances may be nec-
essary. However, the basic training principles outlined in this instruction will be adhered to, while
allowing for deviations in range operations and organizational structure. Each MAJCOM/ROA will
develop and reference ECR/ESS operating procedures as a supplement to this instruction.
     5.1.1. Mission. The mission of an ECR/ESS is to provide a realistic electronic threat environment for
     the combat training of aircrews. In addition, ECRs/ESSs provide Electronic Combat support for com-
     posite force training, unit exercises, unit gunnery competitions, normal training missions, and higher
     HQ exercises or inspections. To accomplish this, EC threat equipment and operating procedures must
     closely parallel those of the anticipated enemy threat systems.
     5.1.2. Electronic Scoring Sites. ESSs are no-drop bomb scoring sites that primarily support aircrew
     training for strategic and tactical weapons delivery or tactical cargo airdrops in a realistic environ-
     ment. ESSs are normally located near instrument MTRs. These ranges require only a small land area
     for equipment location. An ESS has the capability to provide mission debriefings detailing individual
     aircrew or large force analysis/feedback on the effectiveness of Electronic Counter Measures (ECM)
     and threat avoidance procedures.
     5.1.3. Electronic Combat Ranges. Collocated with air-to-air and air-to-surface ranges, ECRs provide
     a simulated electronic threat environment for aircrew combat training. ECRs can vary in complexity
     and the level of training provided. ECRs are located within range boundaries, and off-range to provide
     aircrew training in MOAs, MTRs, and other SUAs. ECRs are further delineated as Basic or Advanced
     ECRs.
        5.1.3.1. Basic ECR. Basic ECRs provide Electronic Combat training primarily to units within a
        local operating area. A Basic ECR consists of at least three geographically separated threat emit-
        ters capable of providing a limited EC threat environment. Additionally, each Basic ECR has the
        capability to provide analysis/feedback on the effectiveness of ECM and/or threat avoidance pro-
        cedures.
        5.1.3.1. (ANG) ANG Ranges will provide basic through advanced electronic threats as required
        by units in accordance with range capabilities.
        5.1.3.2. Advanced ECR. Advanced ECRs provide a variety of electronic combat training scenar-
        ios in an Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) environment. An Advanced ECR consists of a
        minimum of ten geographically separated threat emitters integrated in an IADS type environment
        capable of providing a variety of tactical and strategic Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) and
        Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA) training scenarios. Mobile emitters are used to provide scenario
        flexibility. Additionally, each Advanced ECR has the capability to provide mission debriefings
        detailing individual aircrew or large force analysis/feedback on the effectiveness of ECM and
        threat avoidance procedures.
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                      47


   5.1.4. Electronic Combat Personnel Training. ECRs/ESSs provide a realistic electronic threat envi-
   ronment for aircrew combat training. Therefore, it is essential that threat operators assigned to ECRs/
   ESSs have a working knowledge of EC doctrine and employment concepts.
       5.1.4.1. Training Programs. Management criteria, administrative practices, and training policies
       required to conduct a comprehensive ECR/ESS training program will include academics and prac-
       tical application in live and simulated environments. Unit developed training programs will adhere
       to applicable USAF/MAJCOM safety procedures. ECR/ESS personnel should be familiar with
       applicable MAJCOM-series training events.
          5.1.4.1.1. (Added-ANG) All ANG range personnel who operate or maintain EC threat simu-
          lators and visual cueing systems will be trained by a unit or contractor developed training pro-
          gram that includes the following areas; initial orientation to mission, organization and safety,
          hands-on training with threat simulator, radio and visual cueing devices, and refresher training
          as deemed necessary by the ROA.
       5.1.4.2. Responsibilities. Unit commanders, ECR/ESS operations officers, and/or site managers
       are responsible for the selection and written designation of instructor personnel who will conduct
       site training. The unit training officer/site manager is responsible for developing the unit training
       programs, training schedules, quarterly and annual unit training plans, and lesson plans, and is the
       unit approving authority for all unit developed training courses or programs.

5.2. Electronic Combat Equipment Management. EC range equipment consists of SAM simulators,
AAA simulators, Smokey SAMs, and ground-based jamming systems. See AFI 13-212, Volume 2 for
special equipment and systems to simulate enemy threats. (See Attachment 1 for emitter/simulator defi-
nition).
   5.2.1. Requests for New/Additional Threat Systems, Reallocation, and Modification. HQ ACC is the
   lead command for all requests for new/additional threat emitters, simulators, and systems. AFI
   10-901, Lead Operating Command--Communications and Information Systems Management, pro-
   vides guidance on the lead command duties and responsibilities. Development of new threats systems
   will be processed through the CTR Executive Review. The impacted MAJCOMs will mutually agree
   upon requests for reallocation of threat systems. HQ USAF/XOOR will arbitrate any unresolved
   issues.
   5.2.1. (ANG) ANG C4R is the validating agency for new or additional threat systems for ANG range
   inventory. The originating ROA will validate the requirement by official letter to ANG C4R. The
   request must include the number and type system required, mission requirements and confirmation of
   maintenance facility, funding and personnel to adequately support the requested system.
   5.2.2. Requests for Disposition of Equipment. MAJCOM approval is required before a unit deacti-
   vates, transfers, or decommissions any threat emitter or simulator. All deactivation/decommission and
   final disposition requests will be processed through the applicable MAJCOM and forwarded to HQ
   ACC. HQ USAF/XOOR will arbitrate any unresolved issues.
   5.2.2. (ANG) ANG/C4R is the approval authority for deactivating or decommissioning any ANG
   electronic threat asset. ANG/C4R will provide disposition instructions for all ANG electronic threat
   equipment.

     5.2.3. Equipment Inventory and Configuration Control. HQ ACC/DOR will develop and maintain a
     system that accurately inventories, tracks equipment, and documents the configuration of threat emit-
     ters and simulators.
     5.2.4. Range Equipment Utilization. Each ECR/ESS is required to report monthly range equipment
     utilization as part of the quarterly range equipment utilization report IAW this instruction.
     5.2.4. (ANG) ANG ITRs, PTRs, ACTS, and ECR will use ACC/DOR developed software to elec-
     tronically report utilization data for equipment tracked by ACC/DOR.
     5.2.5. ECR/ESS Equipment. AFI 13-212, Volume 2 lists the equipment used for Electronic Warfare
     and Radar Bomb Scoring (RBS).

5.3. Radio Frequency Spectrum Issues. ROAs will coordinate all systems requiring radio frequency
spectrum through the appropriate MAJCOM Spectrum Management Office. Failure to consider frequency
requirements during initial range planning could seriously hamper testing as well as limit training once a
system becomes operational.

5.4. Electronic Warfare Product Improvement Working Group (EW PIWG). The Range Threat
Systems Office will chair an EW PIWG IAW AFI 21-118, Improving Aerospace Equipment Reliability
and Maintainability. The primary goals of the EW PIWG are to receive feedback from equipment users,
jointly establish priorities for future efforts, develop solutions to Reliability & Maintainability (R&M)
problems, and provide updates concerning on-going efforts.

5.5. Conduct of Electronic Attack and Chaff Procedures. Use, approval, and employment of Elec-
tronic Attack and chaff will be IAW CJCSM 3212.02, Performing Electronic Attack in the United States
and Canada for Tests, Training and Exercises, and/or specific range guidance, whichever is more restric-
tive.

5.6. Scheduling. ROAs will schedule ESS activity via the approved military scheduling authority for that
asset. Attempt to schedule ESS activity to maximize asset usage and minimize unit-training conflicts.

5.7. Electronic Scoring Site Activity. ROAs should make every effort to score requested ESS activity.
Aircrews should conduct ESS activity IAW procedures in the appropriate aircraft specific AFI 11-XXX
series. ESSs refer to the chapter pertinent to the system or area of operation necessary for mission accom-
plishment. Enter deviations from scoring directives in Site Remarks Section of Aircrew Score Informa-
tion Network (ASIN), Command Bomb Data Analysis (CBDA), or other report. MAJCOMs will
determine mission priorities for unit ESS activity.

                                   REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

6.1. Reporting Requirements. Range resources are limited, costly, and subject to competing require-
ments for their use. Range utilization reports provide important data for the management of these
resources. To plan and document use of these resources, MAJCOMs will ensure their ROAs compile
quarterly range utilization reports as outlined below and maintain a three-year historical record of these
reports. HQ USAF/XOOR in conjunction with the MAJCOMs will develop and maintain an AF range uti-
lization database to track range use, as well as usage data on electronic threat, scoring, and instrumenta-
tion feedback systems. Reporting requirements covered in this chapter apply to USAF managed or
scheduled ranges only.
6.1. (ANG) Reporting Requirements. ANG ranges will submit monthly utilization reports no later than
ten workdays following the reporting period IAW the format and procedures established by ANG/C4R.
ANG ITRs, PTRs, and ECR will use ACC/DOR developed software to electronically report utilization
data for equipment tracked by ACC DOR.
   6.1.1. Report Requirements and Protocols.
       6.1.1.1. Data Currency. ROAs will update data currency monthly and submit quarterly reports to
       MAJCOMs no later than 10 working days following the reporting period. MAJCOMs will vali-
       date these reports and forward to HQ USAF/XOOR no later than 15 working days following the
       reporting period.
       6.1.1.2. Reporting Methods. E-mail or updates via a World Wide Web page are the primary
       reporting method. Data disks may be submitted instead of e-mail. E-mail accounts for all users in
       the reporting chain will be identified with MAJCOM or unit and the appropriate office symbol fol-
       lowed by the words “Range Utilization Report” (i.e., 27OSS/OSTR Range Utilization Report). Do
       not use personal addresses.
       6.1.1.3. Time Calculations. The monthly resource utilization data will be recorded in hours and
       tenths of hours. When two or more activities use resources simultaneously, identify time for all
       users.
       6.1.1.4. Classification. Submit only unclassified reports. Transmit classified information sepa-
       rately through proper means.

6.2. Range Utilization Report. ROAs will use these reports to track a variety of data associated with
determining range workload requirements and providing information associated with environmental
actions. ROAs will report all range utilization, cancellations, and closures. MAJCOMs/ROAs can use the
range utilization reports to determine manning requirements (contractor or government personnel) before
the start of each fiscal year. MAJCOMs will include a synopsis of this analysis when submitting POM and
annual budget requests. See Attachment 3 for range utilization report content and format.

6.3. Expended Munitions Tracking Report. ROAs will maintain permanent records of all expenditures
(types, quantities, locations, using organization, and estimated dud rates) per target of ammunition and
explosives. MAJCOMs/ROAs will comply with the record keeping requirements of Title 40 Code of Fed-
eral Regulations, Part 260, Military Munitions Rule, DoD Directive 4715.11, and DoD Directive 4715.12.
50                                                       AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005


6.4. Range Residue Clearance/Decontamination Report. Each ROA will submit a range residue clear-
ance/decontamination report to their MAJCOM, concurrent with periodic or annual clearance activity.
This report is a record of events involved in residue clearance/ decontamination of a range. It must include
the number of people and the amount of money and material required to accomplish the work. The report
indicates the areas that have been cleared to include precise area boundaries. For closing, transferring, and
transferred ranges, attach the range residue clearance/decontamination report to the Certificate of Clear-
ance. The Certificate of Clearance is a report that becomes an official document certifying that all danger-
ous and explosive materials reasonably possible to detect have been removed.

6.5. RAMPOD Configuration Management System. The Reliability, Availability, Maintainability Pod
(RAMPOD) configuration management system is a PC-compatible, database system that is used to track
pod/test-set location, movement, modernization, configuration, utilization, and maintenance status.
RAMPOD requires field units/contractors to update the database system to reflect any changes in loca-
tion, configuration, or maintenance status of the pod/test-set. This system provides visibility into the dis-
position and configuration of these assets to all levels of command. AAC/WMR will monitor the
RAMPOD configuration management system. Funding will be provided by AAC/WMR or as agreed
upon by the CTR Executive Review members. Termination of the RAMPOD system will be at the discre-
tion of the CTR Executive Review members. The RAMPOD system policies and procedures apply to
CAF, AETC, AFRC, and ANG units.
     6.5.1. Policy. Units requesting additional pods/test-sets to fill mission requirements on a temporary
     basis (no transfer of ownership) will attempt to resolve these requests inter-unit. Temporary loans will
     be annotated by the lending unit in the RAMPOD database. Unfulfilled requirements will be for-
     warded to ACC/DOR for arbitration and direction by the CTR. Shipping costs will be the responsibil-
     ity of the gaining unit. Pods will be returned in the same maintenance status as they were received.
     Units requesting additional pods/test sets and related equipment to fill mission requirements on a per-
     manent basis (transfer of ownership) will attempt to resolve these requests inter-MAJCOM. The coor-
     dinated request will be forwarded to ACC/DOR. Shipping costs will be the responsibility of the
     gaining unit. Additionally, the CTR Executive Review members will coordinate with ACC/DOR, who
     will provide final distribution plans for new production pods/test-sets to AAC/WMR. ACC/DOR will
     work day-to-day issues and any additional changes to the approved plan. AF/XOOR will arbitrate any
     unresolved differences.
     6.5.2. Responsibilities. AAC/WMR will provide funding to support the RAMPOD system or as
     agreed upon by the CTR Executive Review members. HQ ACC/DOR will provide units with direc-
     tion for implementation of RAMPOD, including, but not limited to: activities associated with collec-
     tion and maintenance of data, input pod/test-set inter-unit movement procedures, configuration
     change, routine maintenance and actual pod loss/damage data into the RAMPOD, and coordinate with
     RAMPOD in efforts to compile, maintain, and report reliability/maintainability data for the ACTS
     pods/test sets. The purpose of this guidance is to ensure standardization and continuity. MAJCOMs
     will provide direction to field units by establishing procedures to ensure all data is submitted to RAM-
     POD. This provides an accurate means of assessing reliability and maintainability of components,
     maintenance and repair events, and on-line inventory and warranty status from system level to the
     lowest serialized component. WR-ALC/RAMPOD will collect maintenance data for Reliability and
     Maintainability (R&M), warranties, and other information as deemed necessary to meet RAMPOD
     requirements. Under no circumstances will units move pods/test-sets either on a temporary or perma-
     nent basis without documentation in the RAMPOD system.

   RANGE MAINTENANCE; AMMUNITION, EXPLOSIVES, AND OTHER DANGEROUS
    ARTICLES (AEDA)/RANGE RESIDUE CLEARANCE/ DECONTAMINATION; AND
             CLOSING OR TRANSFERRING OF AIR FORCE RANGES

7.1. Range Maintenance. ROAs must develop an annual range maintenance and clearance/decontami-
nation schedule that renovates, removes, replaces, and overhauls range targets and systems. Maintenance
should be preventative as well as corrective. Range maintenance is the responsibility of the ROA through
in-house or contract resources. If range maintenance has been contracted, the Functional Director or
Functional Commander will have responsibility for oversight.
7.1. (ANG) Range Maintenance. ROAs will submit exemptions IAW AFI 13-212, Volume I, Paragraph
1.6., to the clearance criteria for areas that cannot be cleared due to accessibility or other conditions.

7.2. Ammunition, Explosives, and Other Dangerous Articles (AEDA)/Range Residue Clearance/
Decontamination Responsibility. Each MAJCOM/RO A is responsible for AEDA/range residue clear-
ance on active and inactive ranges under its control IAW DoD Directive 4715.11, Environmental and
Explosives Safety Management on Department of Defense Active and Inactive Ranges within the United
States, DoD Directive 4715.12, Environmental and Explosives Safety Management on Department of
Defense Active and Inactive Ranges Located Outside the United States, and Title 40 Code of Federal Reg-
ulations, Part 260, Military Munitions Rule. Furthermore, each MAJCOM/ROA must dispose of radioac-
tive wastes IAW the Air Force Radioactive and Mixed Waste Office (AFRMWO) and AFI 40-201,
Managing Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force. In addition, each MAJCOM/ROA should accom-
plish a periodic despecularization on those ranges used for laser training (see paragraph 4.1.5.4.). The
ROA is responsible for funding and scheduling all AEDA/range residue clearance. The ROA should pub-
lish a "straw-man" schedule in the unit Comprehensive Range Plan. This plan must address USAF, fed-
eral, state, local, tribal, and host nation requirements and standards for land management and pollution
abatement. The ROA or QAE may temporarily postpone AEDA/range residue clearance on a
case-by-case basis for severe weather or other unforeseen circumstances that warrant delays.

7.3. AEDA/Range Residue Clearance/Decontamination. AEDA/range residue clearance includes the
removal or disposal of all ordnance, inert ordnance residue, Training Projectile (TP) ammunition, and
other range residue material reasonably possible to detect (normally down to four inches in size). Military
EOD personnel or civilian UXO contractors inspect ordnance residue. Military EOD personnel render
safe and dispose of unexploded ordnance IAW established procedures and practices. Trained non-EOD
range or range O&M contractor personnel may then remove safe or inert ordnance residue, TP ammuni-
tion, and other range material. EOD personnel must brief the range clearance personnel on the possible
hazards and the safe handling of debris. Debris should be subjected to double-inspection or a mechanized
process to ensure AEDA is not released to the public. Dispose of safe ordnance debris according to appro-
priate Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) directives, as directed by Memorandum of
Agreement with DRMO, or through an option for direct commercial sales. Processing AEDA residue
should not be viewed as a funds generating activity. Management and disposal of AEDA must consider
safety first. Additionally, DoD Instruction 4715.4, Pollution Prevention, excludes ships, aircraft, weap-
ons, other material required to be demilitarized or mutilated, and scrap resulting from demilitarization
from being sold through a qualified recycling program. The proceeds from their sale SHALL NOT be
returned to a qualified recycling program.

7.3. (ANG) AEDA/Range Residue Clearance/Decontamination. Any use of explosives for ordnance
safing/disposal by UXO contractors, and other contractors will be permitted only after a Site Specific
Safety Plan (SSSP) is approved by ANG/C4R, Weapons Safety (ANG/SEW), and Civil Engineering
Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) (ANG/CEXD). For the purposes of this instruction, the following
definitions for EOD/UXO technicians apply: (1) EOD refers to military EOD personnel of any branch of
the US Armed Forces. (2) UXO refers to those contracted personnel that are trained to handle/inspect
explosive ordnance. This plan will address all aspects of the explosive operations to be conducted to
include the following:
     7.3.1. To identify, safeguard, and dispose Unexploded Ordnance (UXO), MAJCOMs will ensure that
     all ROAs accomplish the following:
        7.3.1.1. Safely clear UXO from ranges consistent with the stated mission of the installation and
        for the continuing viability of the range. Resolve all conflicts between explosive safety and other
        requirements with the objective of minimizing explosive hazards. Do not use controlled burning
        as a method of UXO clearance on USAF ranges. Burning to clear vegetation is authorized so long
        as environmental and safety requirements are met.
        7.3.1.2. Prepare a plan for range clearance operations. At a minimum, consider the number of per-
        sonnel involved, types of ordnance anticipated to be encountered and/or recovered, support
        requirements, expected levels of contamination, and a clearly articulated rational for UXO clear-
        ance.
        7.3.1.3. Prohibit unauthorized access to ranges and Target Areas. Post UXO hazard warning signs
        where possible (bilingual, as required) and require other access controls, as necessary.
        7.3.1.4. Ensure individuals authorized access to USAF ranges receive appropriate explosive
        safety training before entering the range.
        7.3.1.5. Establish an outreach program to educate installation personnel and the public about the
        dangers of trespassing and UXO hazards. Using appropriate forums, address range issues that
        have the potential to influence the surrounding community.
        7.3.1.6. Respond promptly to protect personnel and property from any UXO located off a military
        installation IAW AFI 32-3001, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Program.
        7.3.1.7. Notify installation personnel and the public, as appropriate, if any range operation pre-
        sents a potential explosive hazard off the range. This includes informing the public of any mishap
        that could influence the local community and may require additional precautions and/or restric-
        tions.
        7.3.1.8. Respond immediately to releases or substantial threats of release of hazardous UXO con-
        stituents, when such release or threat of release poses an imminent and substantial threat to human
        health or the environment IAW DoD Response authorities under Title 10, United States Code,
        Section 2701, Environmental Restoration Program, and Title 42, United States Code, Section
        9604, Response Authorities.
        7.3.1.9. On active and inactive ranges, the procedures for evaluating and responding to explosives
        safety, human health, and environmental risks will be IAW Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations,
        Part 260, Military Munitions Rule.
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                     53


       7.3.1.10. Limit the use of live cluster munitions (Mk-20 Rockeye and CBU-XX series munitions)
       for training. Conduct cluster munitions release on designated Target Areas only and make all rea-
       sonable attempts to employ inert and live cluster munitions on different targets.
       7.3.1.10. (ANG) ANG Ranges will not permit Cluster Munitions or DU munitions.

              disposal work shall contain provisions for QAE surveillance visits by the government
              (e.g., military EOD, ACC/DOR representative, ROA personnel or Contracting Officer
              designated personnel). These surveillance visits will be performed at least once during
              each scheduled UXO range clearance operation. Additional surveillance visits will be
              accomplished depending on breadth and scope of contracted work performed. Surveil-
              lance reports will be forwarded to the Contracting Officer and copies provided to HQ
              ACC/DORI. Safety deficiencies noted by the EOD QAE will be immediately identi-

            7.3.1.12.4. All areas known or suspected to contain UXOs using range maps and/or installa-
            tion master planning maps. Conduct historical research as necessary.
        7.3.1.13. Remove all hazardous material from items used as targets IAW AFI 13-212, Volume 2.

7.4. AEDA/Range Residue Clearance Types and Requirements. The three AEDA/range residue
clearance types are active, inactive, or excess, depending on the status of the range concerned. Limit
active AEDA/range residue clearance to the range surface. Perform subsurface AEDA/range residue
removal, as required, (e.g. construction work in the Target Area, burying cables, etc.) to a depth that per-
mits safe operations on the range. Report subsurface AEDA/range residue clearance separately. Clear
active ranges or in-use Target Area programmed for continued use as described below. The frequency of
AEDA/range residue clearance is established by the Functional Director or Functional Commander and is
verified by the QA personnel, based on the type of range and specific circumstances surrounding its use.
Target Areas used specifically for testing live munitions containing extremely hazardous fusing will be
identified as "Extremely Hazardous Contaminated Target Areas". Clearance requirements of “Extremely
Hazardous Contaminated Target Areas” will be based on an Environmental, Safety, and Occupational
Health (ESOH) risk analysis, and if warranted, a waiver request will be forwarded to HQ USAF/XOOR
for staffing through appropriate USAF ESOH agencies.
     7.4.1. Periodic AEDA/Range Residue Clearance/Decontamination. The frequency for AEDA/range
     residue clearance for Service Class A/MRTFBs is every three months or 75 Use-Days. Clear the tar-
     gets used for missiles, rockets, and bomb testing/training of all UXO and inert residue to a radius of
     100 meters. ANG, Edwards AFB, and Eglin AFB will comply with the provisions in 7.4.2.1..
 NOTE:
On a conventional range, strafe targets are hand-policed daily, and a more detailed clearance is performed
every week or six Use-Days.
     7.4.2. Annual Range Residue Clearance/Decontamination.
        7.4.2.1. Service Class A, B, and C Ranges. Annually, clear the areas around the targets used for
        missiles, rockets, and bomb testing/training of all UXO and inert residue to a radius of 300 meters
        (1000 feet). In addition, annually, clear the access ways into the tactical targets as well as the area
        30 meters (100 feet) on either side of the access ways. When targets are relocated, clear the access
        ways and new Target Areas per the annual clearance criteria. The ANG, Edwards AFB, and Eglin
        AFB requirement is to clear, as prescribed above, any target with 20,000 bombs dropped on it or
        all targets annually, whichever occurs first.
     7.4.3. Complete Clearance. Every five years perform a Complete Clearance on each existing range.
     The Complete Clearance includes inspection, removal, and disposal of munitions and unusable target
     debris and may be accomplished incrementally (e.g. 20% of the required area per year for five years).
     The criteria for Complete Clearance is a radius of 1000 meters around each target or an area that has a
     density factor of less-than-or-equal-to five whole ordnance items per acre, whichever is closer to the
     target. To ensure adequate range residue clearance/decontamination, MAJCOMs or equivalents will
     specify ordnance-sampling criteria for areas outside of the cleared areas up to the range boundaries.
     Clear these areas when the criteria reach a density factor of greater than five whole ordnance items per
     acre.
     7.4.4. AEDA/Range Residue Clearance/Decontamination Waivers. MAJCOMs may submit a waiver
     request to HQ USAF/XOOR if they require relief from the AEDA/range residue clearance and decon-
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                   55


  tamination requirements. Waiver approval will be based on individual merit and extenuating circum-
  stances (e.g., USAF Target Areas overlapping with other Service Target Areas). The waiver package
  must include ESOH risk analysis and identify precautions to take in order to minimize hazards, as
  well as a plan to achieve full compliance with clearance/decontamination requirements before the
  wavier expires.
  7.4.5. Equipment Used in Maintenance and Clearance/Decontamination. See AFI 13-212, Volume 2
  for equipment used in maintenance and AEDA/range residue clearance/decontamination.
  7.4.6. Decontamination Assistance. Forward requests for periodic and complete range decontamina-
  tion assistance to the EOD team responsible for that range. If manning assistance is required, the EOD
  team will forward a request to the MAJCOM EOD functional management office at least 90 days
  before the proposed start of the operation. The request should include:
     7.4.6.1. Periods of required assistance (days, weeks, etc.).
     7.4.6.2. Number of personnel required.
     7.4.6.3. Names and telephone numbers of the operating agency point-of-contact.
  7.4.7. (Added-ANG) Command Range Residue Removal (R3) Procedures. The ROA Resource
  Manager (RM) will ensure that the ACC Four-Step Process for Range Residue Removal and Recy-
  cling is followed.
     7.4.7.1. (Added-ANG) Step 1. All range residue to include target and ordnance residue will be
     checked by EOD/UXO technicians and approved for handling prior to any processing.
     7.4.7.2. (Added-ANG) Step 2. At the conclusion of each range clearance, a chain of custody will
     be established for all residue inspected by EOD/UXO personnel. The residue will be secured in
     the Residue Holding Area until released for processing.
     7.4.7.3. (Added-ANG) Step 3. An independent third party EOD/UXO quality assurance evalua-
     tor will verify all processed material and certify the load on a DD Form 1348-1, DoD Single Line
     Item Release/Receipt Document, and the chain of custody document. Active duty and Active
     Reserve Component (ARC) EOD personnel may perform QAE duties contingent upon availabil-
     ity. Requests for military EOD support should be submitted at least 30 days prior to the start of
     operations through appropriate Headquarters (HQ) EOD functional managers (ACC/AFRC/ANG)
     and base civil engineer commanders.
     7.4.7.4. (Added-ANG) Step 4. If contracted, AF Quality Assurance Evaluators shall survey con-
     tractor performance to verify compliance with all contract specifications and safety requirements.
     Additionally, all material shall be secured and under chain of custody receipt until the material is
     directly consumed.
  7.4.8. (Added-ANG) Residue Holding Areas (RHA). A RHA is a secured area with appropriate
  administrative/physical controls that limit access. The RHA should be located outside the Weapons
  Safety Footprint Area. All range residue material will be checked and approved for movement by
  qualified EOD/UXO technicians prior to placement in the RHA. Residue in holding areas shall be
  segregated according to type of residue. Segregation categories include (but are not limited to)
  full-scale practice munitions, sub-scale practice munitions, light metal and commercial grade vehi-
  cles, armored vehicles, Smokey SAMs, non-recyclable residue, radioactive components awaiting dis-
  position by the base's Bioenvironmental Flight, etc.

     7.4.9. (Added-ANG) Radiological Sweep. Range residue will be swept by radiological equipment by
     appropriately trained personnel. This survey includes aircraft components, dials, gauges, tank starting
     units, etc., to determine if radioactive components are present. If radioactive components are found,
     remove, segregate, and package radioactive items for government pick-up and disposal. All residues
     shall be checked for radioactivity before removal from range. Follow Nuclear Regulatory Guide 1.86,
     Termination of Operating Licenses for Nuclear Reactors, Table 1. Be aware that level of radioactive
     activity allowed by smelters and scrap yards is less than that allowed by the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
     mission.
     7.4.10. (Added-ANG) Range Residue Certification. Range residue will be checked to ensure that it is
     inert and/or free of explosives by the Senior UXO supervisor, before any processing will occur. No
     site activity will take place without the presence of qualified UXO personnel. The Senior UXO super-
     visor is responsible for all contractor on-site range residue certification activities. The Senior UXO
     supervisor shall have at least 15 years combined active duty military EOD, ANG EOD technician and
     contractor UXO experience, to include at least ten years in supervisory positions, and be a graduate of
     the US Navy EOD School. A minimum of six years of the required 15 years experience shall be on
     active duty or an ANG EOD technician in military EOD units. This individual shall have documented
     experience with and/or specialized training in the type of munitions/ordnance items expected while on
     each site. All proposed UXO personnel are subject to the approval of HQ ACC EOD Branch (ACC/
     CEXE). Contractors will provide list of UXO personnel and their qualifications for approval at least
     30 days prior to the start of each range operation.
     7.4.11. (Added-ANG) Processing. Prior to commencing, work plans will be developed to address the
     work to be performed, procedures, range schedule (for the overall project and for each range) and
     resources necessary and relevant to the accomplishment of the project objectives. The work plan will
     address specific milestones such as field survey duration, scope of the effort, start and completion
     timelines. The process for demilitarizing munitions and munitions residue shall leave them in a condi-
     tion where they will not be recognizable as munitions. DoD 4160.21-M and DoD 4160.21-M-1,
     Defense Demilitarization Manual, will be followed to ensure proper demilitarization is accomplished.
     All processed material will be accompanied by a completed DD Form 1348-1 Issue Release/Receipt
     Document and DD Form 1348-2, Issue Release/Receipt Document with Address Label and
     chain-of-custody documentation (locally produced). Sub-scale practice bombs (e.g., bomb dummy
     unit (BDU)) and other sub-scale practice munitions, expended rockets and warheads, inert projectiles;
     guided missile parts and guided bomb components will be run through a process that reduces these
     items into four-inch pieces or smaller and unrecognizable as munitions items. Full-scale inert bombs
     will be cut up into at least two pieces (after the tail and front portions of the bomb have been removed/
     cut off). The inner filling will be removed.
     7.4.12. (Added-ANG) Third Party UXO Quality Assurance (QA). For contracted range residue
     removal operations, no site activity will take place without third party UXO QA personnel on-site.
     The UXO QA will have "stop work" authority and will monitor the UXO actions to ensure project
     compliance and safety. The third party UXO QA may be a contractor or military EOD if the UXO QA
     is contracted. This person shall have at least 15 years experience in the UXO field and must be a grad-
     uate of the US Navy EOD school. This person may be an independent UXO contractor (but under no
     circumstances will this individual report to the contract and/or R3 site manager) or government per-
     sonnel from Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) in TO 11A-1-60, Inspection Of Reusable Munitions
     Containers And Scrap Material Generated From Items Exposed To Or Containing Explosives, who
     are authorized to sign munitions residue inspections. In all cases the UXO QA will fill out a
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                       57


   chain-of-custody form documenting custody transfer of all residue removed from the range. Active
   duty and ARC EOD personnel may perform QAE duties contingent upon availability. Requests for
   military EOD support should be submitted at least 30 days prior to the start of operations through
   appropriate BCE Commanders through ANG/C4R. If military EOD is used for UXO QA, the senior
   military EOD person must be at least a 7-Skill Level.

7.5. Closing or Transferring of Ranges. It is Air Force policy to decontaminate and issue Certificates
of Clearance for excess ranges or ranges converted to other uses but remaining on the installation property
inventory.
   7.5.1. DoD 6055.9-STD, DoD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards identifies UXO decon-
   tamination standards for closed, transferred, and transferring military ranges. Closed ranges include
   those ranges that are within military control but are put to a use incompatible with range activities.
   Transferring ranges include those ranges associated with Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)
   activities and other property transfers to non-military entities. Transferred ranges include those identi-
   fied in the Formerly Used Defense Site (FUDS) program.
   7.5.2. Declaration of Excess Ranges. Whenever a range is no longer required for any military purpose
   and the decision is made to remove it from the rolls of USAF property, a declaration of excess prop-
   erty is made. Prepare a declaration of excess land IAW AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property, and
   submit through the parent base and MAJCOM real property channels to HQ USAF/XOOR and the Air
   Force Real Estate Agency (AFREA) (SAF/MII). If the lands recommended for disposal have hazard-
   ous ordnance debris, UXO, or other potentially hazardous contamination, then the MAJCOM must
   decontaminate IAW paragraph 7.5.3.
   7.5.3. Decontamination Requirements. It is Air Force policy to decontaminate and issue certificates
   of clearance for excess ranges or ranges converted to other uses but remaining on the installation prop-
   erty inventory. If the lands recommended for disposal have hazardous ordnance debris, UXO, or other
   potentially hazardous contamination, then the MAJCOM is required to:
       7.5.3.1. Prepare a Notice of Contamination.
       7.5.3.2. Prepare a Land Use Determination.
       7.5.3.3. Decontaminate the land IAW DoDD 4715.11 and DoD 6055.9-STD.
       7.5.3.4. Prepare a Certificate of Clearance. Attach a range residue clearance/decontamination
       report, approved by the DoD Explosives Safety Board (DDESB), to the Certificate of Clearance.
       Forward the Certificate of Clearance with the Report of Excess (SF 118) to AFREA (SAF/MII) for
       forwarding to the General Services Administration. Info HQ USAF/XOOR.
       7.5.3.5. Ranges that are inactive and planned by the MAJCOM to be converted to other uses, but
       remain on the installation property inventory, require that the MAJCOM:
           7.5.3.5.1. Decontaminate the land IAW DoDD 4715.11 and DoD 6055.9-STD.
           7.5.3.5.2. Document clearance/decontamination actions in the appropriate tabs of the unit
           Comprehensive Range Plan. Forward two copies of the report to the installation responsible
           for the range. File the original copy with the real estate records maintained by the base civil
           engineer.
58                                                       AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005


            7.5.3.5.3. Prepare a Certificate of Clearance. Attach a range residue clearance/decontamina-
            tion report, approved by DDESB, to the Certificate of Clearance. Upon completion, forward
            the Certificate of Clearance and DDESB approval to AFREA (SAF/MII). Info HQ USAF/
            XOOR.
     7.5.4. Compliance with NEPA when Closing or Transferring Ranges. NEPA requirements are based
     primarily on which agency has environmental responsibility for the land, who is to receive the land,
     and what the immediate use of the land will be. Generally, the landowner has the environmental
     responsibility unless it is specifically vested in another party through a lease, license, LOA, or other
     legal instrument. Normal transfer of real property to other governmental agencies (e.g., returning pub-
     lic domain land to the Department of Interior or reporting excess real property to the General Services
     Administration for disposal) is categorically excluded from the Environmental Impact Analysis Pro-
     cess. Consult the servicing staff judge advocate whenever questions regarding NEPA compliance
     arise.
     7.5.5. Airspace. If a range is no longer required for military use and is permanently converted to other
     uses and no longer requires secure airspace over or around it, the airspace will be turned over to the
     FAA IAW AFI 13-201, Air Force Airspace Management. If the range requires AEDA and range resi-
     due clearance/decontamination, the airspace should not be released to the FAA until the clearance
     efforts are finished, because these efforts may present a danger to low flying aircraft.
     7.5.6. Equipment and Facilities. All government-owned range equipment will be returned to the par-
     ent base controlling the range, when the range is no longer used as an active range. Secure range facil-
     ities so they do not create a potential hazard to personnel. In some cases, this may involve demolition
     and removal of existing structures. If demolition or removal is necessary, ensure compliance with the
     Environmental Impact Analysis Process.

7.6. Ensuring Safety.
     7.6.1. Safety Training. Exercise extreme caution when working within weapon Target Areas to pre-
     clude inadvertent detonation of UXO. Ground and explosive safety briefings will be provided to all
     non-EOD personnel engaged in range residue clearance operations. Non-EOD personnel must be
     briefed on the markings used for practice and inert ordnance, on ordnance rendered safe, and the haz-
     ards they may encounter. The non-EOD personnel may assist in removing training ordnance and other
     inert ordnance that have been inspected and marked for removal by EOD personnel.
     WARNING:
     At no time will non-EOD personnel attempt to move munitions (except training gun ammunition on
     targets designated for that use, and expended Smokey Sam missile simulators) until they have been
     examined by EOD personnel and rendered safe. Only EOD technicians are authorized to handle the
     disposal of hazardous energetic items.
     WARNING:
     Decontamination of ranges is prohibited during periods in which snow covers the ground. Placement
     of new targets, target maintenance, removal, and replacement are not authorized during these periods.
     7.6.2. Safety Requirements. During maintenance and AEDA/range residue clearance, specific
     arrangements must be made to ensure that aircraft operations do not pose a hazard to ground person-
     nel. Each working team must have a signaling device for use in the event an uninformed flight crew
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                   59


  attempts to use the range. In addition, all ground personnel must maintain two-way communications
  with the range control tower or range office while engaged in residue clearance operations.
     7.6.2.1. Service Class A Range Operations During Maintenance and Clearance/Decontamination.
     Maintenance and AEDA/range residue clearance/ decontamination can be conducted on one side
     of a dual Service Class A range (except behind strafe targets) while the RCO is controlling aircrew
     training missions on the other side of the range.
     7.6.2.2. Service Class B and C Range Operations During Maintenance and Clearance/ Decontam-
     ination. Service Class B and C ranges will be closed during maintenance and AEDA/range residue
     clearance/decontamination. However, if several Class B and C ranges are located together, or if
     the range is of sufficient size, clearance/decontamination can occur on a portion of the range while
     the remainder is being used. The operating agency must ensure that aircrews are briefed concern-
     ing the location of ground personnel and that no ordnance is released until target identification is
     certain.
     7.6.2.3. Over flight Procedures. Over flight is not authorized without ROA/RCO approval over
     areas or portions of ranges during maintenance and clearance/ decontamination. This ensures the
     protection of ground personnel and prevents aircraft damage by fragments from demolition oper-
     ations. Strict adherence to the procedures outlined below is mandatory.
         7.6.2.3.1. Range Operations During EOD/Maintenance Closures. Anytime personnel are on a
         range and no demolition operations are planned, missions may be scheduled for dry-only oper-
         ations above 3000 AGL. During demolition operations, missions may be scheduled for
         dry-only operations above 10,000 AGL. When no personnel are on the range, but the range is

                       TEST AND TRAINING USE OF DEPLETED URANIUM

8.1. Policy and Procedures for Use of Depleted Uranium. This instruction establishes policy and pro-
cedures for the use of Depleted Uranium (DU) by Air Force units. Test and training operations involving
DU will be IAW this instruction, AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials In The US Air Force, and
the applicable USAF Radioactive Material Permit issued under the authority of USAF Master Materials
License by the Air Force Medical Operations Agency’s (AFMOA) Radioisotope Committee (RIC).

8.2. Responsibilities.
     8.2.1. HQ USAF. The Air Staff provides policy and operational oversight of the use of DU. Approval
     authority for the use of DU rests with HQ USAF/XO.
     8.2.2. Air Force Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA). The RIC (AFMOA/SGOR) provides regula-
     tory oversight of all radioactive material used in the Air Force, other than those classified as falling
     under Section 91B of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA).
     8.2.3. Unit Commanders. Ensure that only authorized DU activities are conducted, establish pro-
     grams to ensure activities are accomplished safely and in compliance with requirements, and identify
     resources needed to comply with this instruction.
     8.2.4. Personnel handling Depleted Uranium. Individual users are responsible for effective control of
     DU by:
        8.2.4.1. Complying with radiation safety procedures outlined in the license or permit authorizing
        the storage or use of DU, the referenced directives, local operating instructions or directives, and
        verbal instructions of their Radiation Safety Officer and supervisor.
        8.2.4.2. Stopping any imminent danger situation immediately, placing the operation in a safe con-
        figuration, and informing their Radiation Safety Officer or supervisor of unsafe or non-compliant
        radiological conditions and incidents or accidents involving DU.

8.3. Authorized Locations. The use of DU is restricted to sole use Target Areas. Except for Combat
Mix, all other munitions (including practice training munitions) are prohibited from use in a DU Target
Area. Testing of 30 mm API (DU) munitions and reliability certification flight tests are limited to the fol-
lowing locations:
     8.3.1. 30 mm API (DU) Testing.
        8.3.1.1. Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, Range C-64. To conduct life cycle testing of 30mm API
        (PGU-14/B) ammunition, rounds are fired into an enclosed gun butt. Use Range C-64C to handle,
        store, machine, and test R&D items within an enclosed test chamber.

        Evaluation (OT&E) in order to verify ballistics, Operational Flight Program (OFP) software
        changes, Low Altitude Safety and Targeting Enhancement (LASTE) upgrades, and to conduct
        USAF Weapons School instructor pilot training and tactical employment evaluation using Combat
        Mix.
     8.3.2. Reliability Certification Flight Tests.
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                       61


      8.3.2.1. Authorized DoD Installations. Authorized installations in support of the reliability certi-
      fication flight test program include: UTTR; Eglin AFB; Kwajalein Test Range; Alaska Test
      Range; and Tonopah Test Range. Reliability certification flight test activities at Vandenberg AFB,
      Nellis AFB, Whiteman AFB, and Barksdale AFB are limited to carrier/weapon interface and
      launch only.
      8.3.2.2. Jurisdiction. Use of DU for reliability certification flight tests is a 91B activity and falls
      under the jurisdiction of HQ AFSC/SEW.

8.4. Disposal/Decommission Procedures.
   8.4.1. Disposal of Expended DU Penetrators. Expended DU penetrators and visible fragments will be
   collected, packaged, and disposed of in coordination with the base Radiation Safety Officer and the
   Air Force RIC. Before commencing clearance actions, an EOD team will sweep the Target Area and
   “safe” any UXO. Annually, authorized personnel will manually remove visible DU rounds and frag-
   ments, and package them for disposal (see paragraph 8.4.1.2.).
      8.4.1.1. Authorized Personnel. Personnel trained in DU hazards and wearing the appropriate per-
      sonal protective equipment, as determined by a qualified health physicist and the base Radiation
      Safety Officer, will remove penetrators and fragments.
      8.4.1.2. Disposal Packing Requirements. Penetrators and fragments will be packaged for disposal
      or recycling IAW instructions provided by the Air Force Radioactive and Mixed Waste Office
      (AFRMWO). Prepare requests for disposal or recycling IAW AFI 40-201 and coordinate with the
      base Radiation Safety Officer.
      8.4.1.3. Contaminated Targets. Vehicles and tanks that are no longer intended to be used as targets
      or are so damaged from use that they are in need of replacement will be identified and decontam-
      inated or have arrangements made for proper disposal or recycling (See paragraph 8.4.1.2.).
   8.4.2. Decommission Plan. Prior to expending DU at any authorized location, units will develop a
   decommissioning plan identifying costs to remediate DU contamination at the site based on current
   technology. Review and update the decommissioning plan biennially and provide a copy of the plan to
   the RIC (AFMOA/SGOR).

Terms
 NOTE: The purpose of this glossary is to help the reader understand the terms used in this publication. It
does not encompass all pertinent terms. Joint Publication 1-02, DoD Dictionary of Military and Associ-
ated Terms, and AFDD 1-2, Air Force Glossary, contain standardized terms and definitions for DoD and
USAF use.
Aerial Gunnery Target System (AGTS) —The AGTS incorporates a towed banner target with an
acoustical sensor that scores gunnery hits by counting the audible passage of cannon rounds through the
banner material. The AGTS is reeled in and recovered by the tow aircraft if there is no damage to the
target.
Air Force Representative (AFREP) —An Air Force officer stationed at HQ FAA or a regional office
and accredited by AF/XO to provide USAF representation to FAA on airspace/range and air traffic
control matters.
Alert Area —Airspace designated to inform pilots of a high level of training activity or any unusual
activity where prior knowledge would significantly enhance air safety. There are no restrictions placed on
non-participating IFR or VFR aircraft.
Ammunition, Explosives, and other Dangerous Articles (AEDA) —A n y s u b s t a n c e t h a t : b y i t s
composition or chemical characteristics, alone or when combined with other substance(s), is or becomes
an explosive or a propellant; or is hazardous or dangerous to personnel, animal, or plant life, structures,
equipment, or the environment as a result of blast fire, fragmentation, radiological or toxic effects.
Armor Piercing Incendiary (API) —A 30 mm round consisting of a 0.66 pound extruded DU
projectile, alloyed with 0.75 weight percent titanium, encased in a 0.8 mm-thick aluminum shell and
windscreen.
Byproduct Material —Radioactive material (except Source and Special Nuclear Material) yielded in or
made radioactive by exposure to radiation, incident to the process of producing or using Source or Special
(SS) Nuclear Material.
Certificate of Clearance —This is the official document verifying that the cleared rangeland is carefully
searched and cleared. It certifies removal of all dangerous and explosive materials reasonably possible to
detect. The certificate is dated, and a range residue clearance/ decontamination report is attached. The
decontaminated areas identified in red crosshatch on a map, and annotated in the map legend.
Combat Mix (CM) —A sequential mixture of DU and HEI rounds in which one HEI round, followed by
five DU rounds, are fired by the AN/GAU-8 Gatling gun.
Comprehensive Planning —The ongoing, iterative, participatory process addressing the full range of
issues impacting or impacted by a range’s development. Through this process, goals and objectives are
defined, issues are identified, information is gathered, alternative solutions are developed, and a sound
72                                                      AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005


decision-making process is employed to select a preferred alternative for implementation.
Comprehensive Range Plan—The totality of documents that provide a wide range of information
necessary for decision making. It encompasses those specific documents determined to be essential for
planning and managing a range’s assets and operations.
Controlled Firing Area (CFA) —An area in which ordnance firing is conducted under controlled
conditions so as to eliminate hazards to non-participating aircraft, and to ensure the safety of persons and
property on the ground. Aeronautical charts do not depict CFAs.
Controlling Agency —Air Traffic Control (ATC) facility responsible for providing airborne control
services in and around a designated airspace. With respect to a restricted area, the using agency may
authorize transit through or flight within the restricted area according to a joint-use agreement.
DoD Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) —DoD organization charged with promulgation of
ammunition and explosives safety policy and standards, and with reporting on effectiveness of the
implementation of such policy and standards IAW DoD Directive 6055.9, DoD Explosives Safety Board
(DDESB) and DoD Component Explosives Safety Responsibilities
Depleted Uranium (DU) —DU is Uranium ore processed to remove material useful for Nuclear reactor
fuel and Nuclear weapons. Natural Uranium consists primarily of a mixture of two isotopes of uranium:
Uranium-235 and Uranium-238, 0.7 and 99.3 percent, respectively. The resulting Uranium-238 is
Depleted Uranium, which is 0.7 times as radioactive as Natural Uranium. DU is a dense, heavy metal with
a limited health hazard, and has two properties that make it ideal for military applications: extreme
density and its surface ignites on impact (especially with steel).
Despecularization —The removal of any highly reflective material such as glass or polished metal from
Target Areas used as laser targets to prevent potential damaging reflections of the laser emissions. This
will ensure that laser energy is safely contained within the laser safety footprint area.
Emitter/Simulator —Generic terms used to describe threat equipment operated at Electronic Combat
Ranges (ECR) and Electronic Scoring Sites (ESS). However, ACC operates a variety of equipment
including, but not limited to: Emitter only systems, Emitter-Receiver-Processors, and replica type
systems. Carefully compare the similarities and features of different systems and consider operational
requirements. Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) and Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA) simulators include all
manned and unmanned threat emitters.
Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) —The formal process, as outlined in the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), used to assess environmental impacts resulting from a proposed
action.
Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) —The detection, identification, on-site evaluation, rendering safe,
recovery, and final disposal or unexploded explosive ordnance. It may also include explosive ordnance
that has become hazardous by damage or deterioration.
Government Controlled —Control exercised by any agency of the federal government, not just USAF
or DoD.
Hazard Area —The area of a range defined by a composite of all weapon safety footprints for all
authorized weapon delivery events, against targets located in a given sub-range or target complex. They
encompass Target Areas, but do not include them.
SAFE-RANGE Program Methodology —A systematic procedure for applying training weapon safety
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                        73


footprints to perform a quantitative risk assessment of aircraft ordnance deliveries.
Isotope —Nuclides having the same number of protons in their nuclei, and hence the same atomic
number, but differing in the number of neutrons, and therefore in the mass number. Almost identical

        A3.1.5.1. Normal Gross Range/Equipment Hours [A]. For Service Class A ranges, the total num-
        ber of shift hours planned per day multiplied by the number of days the range was open in the
        quarter. If the range is manned by contractors, this is the number of daily shift hours specified in
        the contract multiplied by the number of days the range was open in the quarter. If military person-
        nel man the range, use the daily shift hours multiplied as above. For Service Class B and C ranges
        (non-staffed), Gross Range/Equipment Hours will be equal to the published range operating hours
        or total time equipment could have supported the primary mission. The total of [B], [E], [F], [G],
        [H] (and in some cases [J]) and [K] must equal Gross Range Hours [A]. Does not include overtime
        hours, which are reported in [I].
        A3.1.5.2. Range Set-up and Shutdown Hours [B]. This is equal to the number of hours daily mul-
        tiplied by the number of duty days in the quarter that are needed to set-up and shutdown a Service
        Class A range. Measure range set-up time from the beginning of the shift to the time the range is
        declared open. Measure shutdown hours from the time the range is declared closed to the end of
        the shift.
        A3.1.5.3. Operating Hours [C]. Equal to [A] minus [B]. Normally equals published range operat-
        ing hours.
        A3.1.5.4. Overtime Hours [D]. Those hours in excess of shift/contract hours needed to support
        traditional test and training requirements.
        A3.1.5.5. Range Maintenance Closure Hours [E]. The total time the range was not available dur-
        ing operating hours due to either scheduled or unscheduled maintenance/ clearance. “Opportune”
        maintenance performed during an inactive period that would not be an impact as long as at least 15
        minutes prior notice was given. Do not account for opportune range maintenance here.
        A3.1.5.6. Range Weather Closure Hours [F]. The total time the range was not available during
        operating hours to be scheduled or used for primary mission due to poor weather at the range.
        No-shows, or cancellations caused by poor weather elsewhere or aircraft aborts, while the range
        weather was satisfactory, will be logged as a short-notice cancellation. If range weather and main-
        tenance factors were concurrent, only maintenance will be logged.
AFI13-212V1_ANGSUP1_I 15 MARCH 2005                                                                         85


      A3.1.5.7. Short Notice Operations Cancellation [G]. The total time the range was scheduled but
      the originally scheduled user did not show up because of user attrition (ground abort, base
      weather, etc.), short-notice mission changes, schedules change, OPS/HHQ cancels, etc. The MAJ-
      COMs/ROAs will publish in its supplement to AFI 13-212 the latest time that a schedule change
      can be made without classifying it as a short-notice cancellation.
      A3.1.5.8. Range Hours Used [H]. Report the total time expended in support of all users during
      shift/contract hours (in hours and tenths of hours). When two or more activities or flying units use
      the range/resource simultaneously, identify time of all users. MAJCOMs/ROAs will develop use
      categories to account for traditional uses, VIP visits, inspections, shared use, or other authorized
      activities for which the range was manned and/or used.
      A3.1.5.9. Additional Hours Used Outside Normal Operating Hours [I]. This factor accounts for
      uses of the range in excess of shift/contract hours. MAJCOMs/ROAs will develop categories
      within this factor to account for: Special Forces training; range airspace turned over to the FAA for
      their use; hunting; wildlife; environmental and cultural surveys (to include Bureau of Land Man-
      agement and US Fish and Wildlife Service); mineral and natural gas exploration; and other
      non-traditional uses.
      A3.1.5.10. Range Hours Precluded [J]. The total time the range was not available during normal
      operating hours due to other reasons. MAJCOMs/ROAs will develop range hours precluded cate-
      gories. Examples of precluded categories are: encroachments/use by higher priority programs or
      agencies (testing, ranges managed by other Services, etc.); power failures; accident investigations;
      fire hazards; forestry, fish, and wildlife surveys; air traffic control; or other activities that prevent
      use of the range or restricted airspace during normal operating hours.
      A3.1.5.11. No Utilization or No Requirement [K]. That portion of capacity not reported as normal
      range hours used, maintenance, weather, precluded, or other use. Within this category break out
      separately:
          A3.1.5.11.1. Opportune Maintenance Time [K1]. These are hours where the range was open,
          there was no mission utilization, but maintenance was performed. K1 is a subset of K.
      A3.1.5.12. Normal Net Capacity [L]. [A] minus ([B], [E], [F], [J]) or [G]+[H]+[K]. Normal
      capacity does not include overtime hours that are reported in [I].
      A3.1.5.13. Normal Use Rate [M]. Calculate the normal (does not include overtime hours these are
      reported in [I]) use rate as the sum of [G] and [H] divided by [L] multiplied by one hundred. This
      is equal to (G+H)/L * 100 or (G+H)/(G+H+K) * 100.
      A3.1.5.14. User Identification and Support Hours [N]. User name (include wing/unit, service
      (AF, Navy, etc.), and installation) and the time expended in support of each user.
      A3.1.5.15. Comments [O]. As required to explain factors, categories or special circumstances.

A3.2. Report Format. Each MAJCOM/ROA will compile the data in an Excel spreadsheet or
web-based format. The MAJCOMs/ROAs may add additional data requirements, as required. Data col-
lection and transmission from field to MAJCOM may be automated or via the web. An example format
follows:

                               ANG RANGE COUNCIL CHARTER
A4.1. (Added-ANG) ANG Range Council Charter. The following is the ANG Range Council Charter

AIR NATIONAL GUARD RANGE COUNCIL CHARTER
Effective 1 December 2003

1. This charter establishes the Air National Guard (ANG) Range Council - its purpose, goal, objectives,
and membership. The need for this council was recognized at the January 1988 Range conference and is
outlined in AFI 13-212, Volume I, Range, Planning and Operations.

2. PURPOSE - To serve as an advisory group to the Air National Guard Readiness Center Range Man-
ager, ANG/C4RR.

3. GOAL - To increase ANG range efficiency and capability.

4. OBJECTIVES -

   a. To aggressively pursue an agenda of general interest and benefit to all ANG ranges.

   b. To provide consolidated positions for these issues to ANG/C4RR.

   c. To provide staff support for ANG/C4RR generated range issues requiring field inputs.

   d. To provide a pool of functional expertise, from ANG range personnel, for specialized needs at des-
ignated ranges.

5. The Council will consist of one voting member from each ANG Range, the 266 RANS, and one
non-voting member from each AFRC range. At least eight Council members must be present (Quorum)
if a decision is required on a motion/proposal. Council Chairman and Vice-Chairman will be elected
every two years, preferably during an ANG Range Conference. Nominations will be solicited and elec-
tion ballots prepared between meetings. The ANG Range Manager will be included as a non-voting
member of the council.

6. The Council will meet three times annually, typically in January, May, and September. The meetings
will be at various ANG ranges, other locations at the Council's discretion, or in the Washington, DC met-
ropolitan area. Ranges expecting inspections within 6-12 months, or ranges having pressing needs
should be visited first.
