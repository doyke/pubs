                                    GENERAL PROCEDURES

1.1. Air Force Form 1206, Nomination for Award:
   1.1.1. Nominations will be one page (front only) and in bullet format using the designated pitch of
   PerFORMPRO or Delrina FormFlow. Do not include classified information in the nomination. Do not
   sign the Air Force Form 1206.
   1.1.2. Do not weigh your nominations down with unnecessary, ineffective, flowery language. Direct,
   hard-hitting, fact-filled, results-oriented nominations get more attention than ones which poetically
   describe the nominee’s attributes.
       1.1.2.1. Be specific when giving the timeframe of the accomplishment and do not include accom-
       plishments which occurred outside the nomination period. If another award is formally announced
       and presented during the nomination period, it may be included in the nomination (even if the
       award itself was for accomplishments outside the nomination period). Information should be ver-
       ifiable.
       1.1.2.2. Not all awards have headings for the Specific Accomplishments portion of the Air Force
       Form 1206. For those awards without specific headings, some suggestions for consideration are:
       leadership and management, scope of responsibility, innovative and creative ideas, community
       involvement, initiative, self-improvement efforts, recognition received, etc.

1.2. Nomination Packages:
   1.2.1. Nominations may be sent through electronic-mail (e-mail) to HQ Air Force Personnel Center
   (AFPC), MPF/CSS Operations Branch (DPSFM). The appropriate e-mail address will be announced
   each year by message. The e-mail package must include the Delrina FormFlow version of the AF
   Form 1206 and its data file. The package must be e-mailed from the office of the Major Air Command
   Director of Personnel (MAJCOM/DP) or equivalent. It is the responsibility of the MAJCOM/DP or
   equivalent to maintain a backup disk and copies of all nomination packages in case the e-mail trans-
   mission is unsuccessful.
   1.2.2. If e-mail is not possible or Delrina FormFlow is not being used, packages must be sent via cer-
   tified mail. Each package must contain an original Air Force Form 1206 nomination plus 4 copies.
       1.2.2.1. Place required documents in pocketed folders with plastic document protectors to prevent
       mutilation of nominations during shipment. Use alligator clips to hold nominations together.
       1.2.2.2. Base-level nomination packages must be accompanied by a transmittal letter from the
       host wing commander or equivalent, to the award nominee’s MAJCOM/DP or equivalent. MAJ-
       COM nomination packages must be accompanied by a transmittal letter from the respective MAJ-
       COM/DP or equivalent to HQ AFPC/DPSFM.
       1.2.2.3. MAJCOM, FOAs, etc., will only submit one winner per category. The Dixon award is the
       only exception.

1.3. Award Period. All nominations are based on activities during the fiscal year (1 October - 30 Sep-
tember).
8                                                                     AFI36-2819 19 OCTOBER 2005


1.4. Award Eligibility. Nominees must have served more than 6 months (for individual awards) or have
been in operation for more than 6 months (for group awards) in the specialty for which nominated unless
otherwise annotated.
    1.4.1. Nominees are submitted in a category based on the grade of the individual as of 30 September
    or in the case of a group nomination the size of the unit as of 30 September as explained in paragraph
    1.5.

1.5. Strength Figures for Group Nominations. The military or civilian population is normally the
strength as of 30 September, unless the organization nominated was located at a closure or draw down
installation. Obtain strength figures from the MPF for military strength figures and Civilian Personnel
Flight (CPF) for civilian strength figures. The MPF and CPF should use the base-level Personnel Data
System (PDS) and the command “/STRENGTH_XX” where “XX” is the first two digits of the MPF/CPF
ID. This command will provide the total active duty or civilian strength figures for your nominations. The
exact command for the “/STRENGTH” is found in AFMAN 36-2622, volume 1, chapter 3, Personnel
Data Systems End Users Manual. Each individual, group, or base nominated competes on its own merits
and mission. They are not penalized for size or location.

1.6. Deadlines and Where to Mail Nomination Packages. Nominations not meeting the established
suspense date will be marked “LATE.” Extensions will not be granted.
    1.6.1. DELETED.
    1.6.2. Mail: MAJCOM/DPs or equivalent must submit their nomination packages to HQ AFPC/DPF-
    FOC, 550 C Street West, Suite 37, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4737, with a postmark no later than the
    3d Friday of December of each year.

1.7. Selection Board. A central selection board will select Air Force level winners in all categories. The
board will convene at HQ AFPC each year. A general officer or Senior Executive Service (SES) will head
the board, with colonels, chief master sergeants, and civilian equivalents comprising the board’s member-
ship from the appropriate functional areas. Board members will be divided into panels to review nomina-
tions based on functional expertise. Nonvoting recorders from the functional areas will provide
administrative and technical assistance to the board. Funding for individuals selected to serve on the
selection board will be borne by the unit and/or MAJCOM of assignment. The AF/DP approves all win-
ners.

1.8. Announcement of Winners. Upon approval of the winners, the AF/DP will release a message
Address Indicator Groups (AIG) 8106 , 610 (CPFs), 10406 (Education Centers), 10607 (Reserves), 7309
(Guard) and 9689 (On-the-Job Training [OJT] office at the MPFs and Logistics Maintenance Training
[LGMT]) announcing all the Air Force level winners worldwide.

1.9. Award Recognition. The AF/DP may present engraved plaques, or they will be mailed to each
MAJCOM/DP or equivalent. The MAJCOM/DP or equivalent can forward or present the plaque to their
winners. Additionally, military and civilian winners will be authorized to wear the Air Force Recognition
Ribbon or the Air Force Recognition lapel pin, respectively.
