SUBJECT: Active, ANG, and AFRC Aircraft Configuration Compatibility


RECOMMENDATION: AIRCRAFT OF THE SAME TYPE AND MODEL MUST HAVE THE SAME
CONFIGURATION.

DISCUSSION: System compatibility builds an opportunity for efficient integration and operations of
ANG and AFRC and active forces. It permits sharing of technical assistance, parts equipment, and
personnel. System compatibility greatly reduces the support tail needed for weapon system when it
deploys. It makes sense for inter-operability and joint operations.

HQ AMC/A4 POSITION: Active, ANG, and AFRC pursue weapon system configuration compatibility.
