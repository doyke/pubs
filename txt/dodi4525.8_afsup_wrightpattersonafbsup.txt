ity Distribution Office (ADO) maintain a copy of this publication. The publication outlines specific

envelopes, and labels, must be prepared in accordance with (IAW) the specific requirements outlined in
this publication.
E2.1.7 USPS Notice 67 (current edition) Recommend ADOs maintain a coy of this template, which is to

mation enhances the processing and delivery of mail, and reduces undeliverable-as-addressed mail, both
of which allow cost reduction through improved efficiency.
E2.1.15 (ADDED) USPS Publication 178, Recommendations for Designing Flat Mail (current edition).
Recommend each ADO maintain a copy of this publication. This publication outlines specific design
requirements which qualify flat-size mail pieces for postal discounts. Proper design allows flat-size mail
