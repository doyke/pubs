     minimum:
Tab A: HAZCOM Regulations (AFI 90-821 and 354 FWI 90-821)
Tab B: Work Area/Shop-Specific Written HAZCOM Program
Tab C: Work Area/Shop-Specific HAZCOM Training Plan/Training Materials
354FWI90-821 14 JUNE 2012                                                                           5


Tab D: BE Occupational and Environmental Assessment/Survey reports and other applicable
information provided by Safety, Public Health, Fire Department, etc.
Tab E: Documentation of HAZCOM Training
Tab F: Hazardous Chemical Inventory
Tab G: MSDSs
Tab H: A List of non-routine tasks involving hazardous materials

If items are kept in an alternate location, a cross-reference shall be used in appropriate section to
indicate the location.
   4.3. JSA: Workplace supervisors will identify the tasks where hazardous materials are used,
   personal protective equipment is required, method in which the material is to be used, and
   machine that uses it (if applicable). The JSA must follow the format provided by 354
   FW/SEG.
   4.4. Process Specific Evaluations: Workplace supervisors should breakout the hazardous
   materials used into the processes where they are used as required by EESOH-MIS AF policy.
   4.5. Hazardous Chemical Inventory: Workplace supervisors will ensure an inventory of all
   hazardous chemicals is compiled and maintained in the HAZCOM binder. As a minimum,
   this inventory will identify the manufacturer, chemical or product name, national stock
   number (NSN), and container size. Tracking quantities used, amounts on-hand, and
   identifying the processes where the chemicals are used is also strongly encouraged. This
   inventory must be dated and kept current. The hazardous chemical inventory should be
   numbered in the order in which the MSDSs are filed.
   4.6. Non-routine Task Listing:
       4.6.1. Non-routine tasks are:
           4.6.1.1. Those tasks included within a workplace’s normal activities but performed
           infrequently; for example, cleaning a solvent tank and changing the solvent.
           4.6.1.2. Temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Code
           or job series.
       4.6.2. The supervisor will prepare a list of non-routine tasks or operations (involving
       hazardous materials) performed in the work area. This list will be dated, kept current, and
       maintained in the HAZCOM binder. This listing will also identify Standard Operating
       Procedures (SOP), Operating Instructions (OI), or Technical Orders (TO) governing non-
       routine tasks involving hazardous materials. If after discussions with the workers, it is
       agreed that no non-routine tasks are performed in the work area, the absence of non-
       routine tasks will also be documented. Supervisors will prepare OIs thoroughly
       describing non-routine tasks, associated hazards, and controls if a TO or other document
       does not adequately describe these tasks.
   4.7. MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet): Supervisors are responsible for ensuring MSDSs
   are available for each hazardous chemical used within their respective work centers. These
   MSDSs will also be maintained in the HAZCOM binder. If an MSDS is not available for a
   newly procured chemical, the supervisors should not accept the chemical until an MSDS is
   obtained. MSDSs can be obtained from the manufacturer or supplier, installation or unit
6                                                              354FWI90-821 14 JUNE 2012


    HAZMART, and EESOH-MIS. If not available from theses sources, 354 MDOS/SGOJ or
    354 LRS/LGRMH may be contacted for further assistance.
    4.8. Labels and Other Forms of Warning:
       4.8.1. The workplace supervisor will ensure each container of hazardous chemical in the
       workplace is labeled, tagged or marked with the identity of the hazardous chemical
       contained therein. This includes appropriate hazard warning and the name and address of
       the manufacturer, importer, or other responsible party.
       4.8.2. The workplace supervisor will ensure existing labels on incoming containers of
       hazardous chemicals are not removed or defaced unless the container is immediately
       marked with the required information.
       4.8.3. The workplace supervisor will ensure transfer containers, vats, tanks, and other
       containers filled with hazardous materials are properly labeled IAW AFI 90-821.
       4.8.4. DD Forms 2521 or 2522, signs, placards, process sheets, batch tickets, or other
       such written materials will be used to label these containers IAW AFI 90-821.
    4.9. Employee Information and Training:
       4.9.1. Unit commanders will ensure all supervisors of work areas using hazardous
       materials receive training on the Federal Hazard Communication Training Program
       (FHCTP).
       4.9.2. Initial FHCTP Training. Initial FHCTP training should be conducted at the
       appropriate AF technical training school, and documentation of this training should be
       available. If initial FHCTP training documentation is not available, the workplace
       supervisor should conduct initial training using AFI 90-821. In all cases, the workplace
       supervisor must ensure this training has been done and that it is documented as “Initial
       FHCTP Training” in section III on the AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health
       Record, for each assigned worker.
       4.9.3. Workplace-Specific FHCTP Training.
          4.9.3.1. The industrial hygiene surveys performed by 354 MDOS/SGOJ and the shop
          specific occupational health education materials available from 354 MDOS/SGOL
          are excellent sources of information for workplace-specific training plans.
          Supervisors will develop workplace-specific training plans using the materials from
          these offices to ensure technical accuracy.
          4.9.3.2. Supervisors will conduct workplace-specific training for all employees using
          hazardous chemicals at the time of their initial assignment and when work area/shop
          conditions or hazardous materials change.             Workplace-specific training is
          recommended/strongly encouraged to increase employee hazard awareness and
          enhance HAZCOM effectiveness.
          4.9.3.3. Supervisors will document all workplace-specific training as “Workplace-
          Specific FHCTP Training” in section V on the AF Form 55 for each assigned worker.
       4.9.4. Minimum Employee Information and Training Requirements.
          4.9.4.1. Employees shall be informed of:
354FWI90-821 14 JUNE 2012                                                                      7

Painting Exterior Paint
PROCESS DESCRIPTION:
Directive: TOs 1-1-691, 1-1-4, 1-1-8, 1-1-24, 1-1-690 and applicable -3, -23, or equivalent
series TOs
Location: Operations are conducted mainly in hanger 1160. There have been instances where
these operations have been performed in other areas such as the Thunder Dome Hanger. All
other areas used are open bay hangers.
Before operations start, the hanger is evacuated and only authorized personnel are remaining.
The doors of the hanger are closed and manned to prevent inadvertent exposures to visitors.
Procedure:
After sanding is complete, personnel prime and paint the plane.
Personnel of the shop “feather” all areas requiring touch-up paint once the plane has been
prepared. Depending on the extent of the damage to the outside paint surface, sanding may
involve going all the way down to bare metal. There are no composites found as part of the skin
of KC-135 aircraft.
Other areas are scuffed using abrasive pads.
Method:
Mechanical spraying using airless sprayers.
Duration: Dependent on the amount of damage (1–3 days).
No ventilation system used or available in the shop.
Personnel must be signed off on the task by a certified trainer within the shop prior to performing
the operation.

Part A3. Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) Procedures

A3.1. General. Each MSDS is a detailed information bulletin prepared by the chemical
manufacturer describing the physical and chemical properties, physical and health hazards,
routes of exposure, precautions for safe handling and use, emergency and first-aid, procedures,
and control measures of the listed hazardous chemicals.

A3.2. Availability. The HAZCOM program monitor maintains copies of all MSDSs for each
hazardous material used in our work area and makes them readily accessible during each work
shift. Copies of all the MSDSs are maintained in [Insert location here ex: MSDS Binder]
located at [location ex: Room 1-b]. The HAZCOM program monitor will reconcile MSDSs on
file and the work area hazardous chemical inventory at least annually.

A3.3. Workers. Workers may review MSDSs for the material they work with and request a copy.

Part A4. Labels and Other Forms of Warning

A4.1. General. It is the responsibility of chemical manufactures and commercial distributors to
label containers of hazardous chemicals according to the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration’s Federal HAZCOM standard. Each container of hazardous chemicals received
must be labeled, tagged, or marked with the:
        --Identity of the material
        --Appropriate hazard warning (flammable, corrosive, etc.)
        --Name & address of the producers (not required for portable containers)
ALL labels must be legible and prominently displayed.

A4.2. Portable Containers. Portable containers do not need to be labeled as long as they are for
immediate use (ref: AFI 90-821, para. 2.6.6.1). If the employee cannot maintain full control over
the chemical or departs the work area, and if there is residual material left in the portable
container this material shall either be disposed of under applicable local disposal regulations,
returned to its original container, or labeled in accordance with applicable regulations.
