This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-6, Capabilities-Based
Planning & Requirements Development. This instruction defines the requirements function in
the 552 ACW, levies responsibilities, sets forth procedures, and describes products. For the
purpose of this instruction, requirements activities are limited to the E-3 aircraft, operational and
mission support software, direct mission support equipment, and training devices. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Information Management Tool (IMT) 847, Recommendation
for Change of Publication; route AF IM 847s from the filed through Major Command
(MAJCOM) publications/forms managers. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management
of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. This instruction is
directive and applies to the 552 ACW and subordinate groups.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision updates the instruction to reflect organizational responsibilities within the 552
ACW regarding requirements activities.

1. General. Requirement activities impact every aspect of the Wing. The timely identification,
validation, and prioritization of requirements are essential to supporting the continued
accomplishment of the 552d Air Control Wingâ€™s mission.

   1.1. Requirements Activities: All activities necessary to state a coordinated Wing need
   (requirement) that has an acquisition solution and all activities necessary to monitor and guide
   the acquisition community as it responds to a stated Wing need. Further, it encompasses all
552ACWI 10-601 13 January 2009                                                                     2

  activities necessary to prepare Wing organizations to implement and take ownership of the
  solution once fielded. Programs/Projects are defined as requirements which have secured a
  funded acquisition solution.

     1.1.2. Concept of Operations: It is incumbent on all managers to review mission
     capability and supportability requirements in order to plan for and implement
     modernization programs. Since, requirement activities involve Wing personnel from every
     level and function it is necessary to have an agency at Wing level to coordinate and direct
     Wing functions and processes to the extent they involve requirements activities.

     1.1.3. On behalf of the commander, 552d ACW, Requirements (XPR) will monitor and
     direct the performance of requirements activities. XPR will be the single point of contact
     to higher headquarters and/or acquisition agencies for all programs/projects requiring an
     acquisition solution, and as such will function as the Office of Primary Responsibility
     (OPR) for long-term requirements programs such as block upgrades and modernization
     efforts. Once projects/ programs migrate to operational/fleet installation status, OPR will
     be transferred to the appropriate group(s), as outlined in the associated program System
     Activation Plan (SAP). XPR will then function as Office of Corollary Responsibility
     (OCR).

2. Organization:

  2.1. At the Wing level, requirements activities will be supervised and directed by 552
  ACW/XPR, Chief of Requirements. This instruction does not specify a formal
  organizational structure below the Wing level. Requirement activities are an inherent part of
  management responsibilities and are left to the Group Commanders to provide the best means
  of accomplishment.

  2.2. XPR will establish working groups to focus on establishing high-level
  needs/requirements and to develop a roadmap for future capabilities. Members of the
  working group will be comprised of action officers from the Operations Group, Maintenance
  Group and Communications Group. The working groups will meet quarterly or as required
  and report activities to the Wing Requirements Working Group (WRWG). The WRWG, in
  turn, reports status and requests direction from Wing leadership via the Wing Requirements
  Review Board (WRRB). The WRRB will be held quarterly.

  2.3. Once a need/requirement receives funding a program Integrated Product Team (IPT) will
  be established. XPR will lead the team consisting of subject matter experts and action
  officers from each affected group and/or function within the Wing. These IPTs function at
  the Wing level. Group Commanders may have group teams for projects that have an
  extensive impact on their organizations to ensure a coordinated effort. Group Commanders
  may establish a requirements section and delegate authority to the section leaders to carry out
  the responsibilities of this instruction.

     2.3.1. Upon formation of the program/project IPT, a SAP will be written and maintained
     by the team. This document provides a top level program overview and outlines the
3                                                   552ACWI 10-601 13 January 2009

      implementation strategy, schedule, funding and issues/concerns. The SAP is a living
      document and should continually reflect significant changes and updates throughout the
      life cycle of the program/project. See Attachment 1 for Sample Program/Project SAP. All
      active SAPs will be available to senior leadership via the XPR web site and serve as the
      basis for continuity and uniformity of purpose in requirement activities.
