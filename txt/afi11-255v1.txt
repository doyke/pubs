     1.7.1. Training start date is the date when the first significant training event (a training event
     directly contributing to qualification, certification, or upgrade) has begun (e.g., FAA ADX)
     after being attached or assigned to the unit. Training time ends with the completion of Initial
     training (FAA Aircraft Dispatcher training and certification) and Mission Qualification
     training (initial evaluation and certification).
1.8. Unsatisfactory Student Progress. Academic instructors and instructor/examiners FMs
will identify students who fail to progress and forward their recommendations to the Student’s
supervisor. If a student fails to progress even after training time extensions are granted, the
Commander 618 AOC (TACC), PACAF 613 AOC/AMD, and the USAFE 603 AOC/AMD or
his/her designated representative will conduct a Progress Review (PR). Following the PR a
recommendation will be made regarding the Continuation of training.
1.9. Training Records. Individuals assigned to a designated training flight or equivalent office
within AMC 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCM, or USAFE 603 AOC/AMCT, and PACAF 613
AOC/AMDM will maintain FM training records.
     1.9.1. Training Records Documentation. The Director of Command and Control 618
     AOC (TACC) and/or PACAF 613 AOC/AMD, USAFE 603 AOC/AMD will designate
     individuals assigned to the training flight organization as responsible for standardizing and
     maintaining FM training records. MAJCOM training forms will be forwarded to the
     MAJCOM A3 or designated representative for approval and included in the MAJCOM
     supplements. NOTE: Use of Electronic Training Records are recommended.
     1.9.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT) Records Review.
        1.9.2.1. Operations Review. FM supervisors will review active training records
        monthly during initial and OJT and immediately prior to scheduling evaluations to
        validate the completion of all training. Operations review will be a separate entry in the
        FM training record and should include comments on the student’s progress. FM
        supervisors should review the daily performance of individuals during MQT.
        1.9.2.2. Training Record Review. As required after each shift, Instructors will review
        training records prior to each shift in order to develop a training plan. As required after
        each shift, instructors will document training in sufficient detail to accurately assess
        student performance and make recommendations for subsequent training. After the
        satisfactory completion of all required training, the instructor will make a
        recommendation for an evaluation. Students will review training records after each
        training shift.
1.10. Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements.
     1.10.1. Instructors must be current and qualified in any event that they instruct.
AFI11-255V1 20 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                     9


   1.10.2. When performing FM duties, the following personnel will be under direct
   supervision of an instructor:
      1.10.2.1. All non-current FMs.
      1.10.2.2. All unqualified FMs.
      1.10.2.3. All FMs in initial, upgrade, or re-qualification training unless performing duties
      they are qualified in where supervision is not required (i.e. An FM in instructor upgrade
      training who is performing non-instructor FM duties).
   1.10.3. Failed Evaluation Procedures. The Director of Command and Control 618 AOC
   (TACC) and/or PACAF 613 AOC/AMD, and the USAFE 603 AOC/AMD or his/her
   designated representative must receive prompt notification of failed FM evaluations.
   Remedial training following a failed evaluation may be the academic contractor’s
   responsibility, Air Force’s responsibility, or a joint responsibility, depending on the nature of
   failure. Identifying the specific required remedial training is the responsibility of the
   evaluator FM. Scheduling and ensuring the prompt accomplishment of remedial training
   following a failed evaluation is the responsibility of the supervisor. In every case, close
   coordination and training priority is required to qualify/requalify the individual as soon as
   practical.
1.11. Distribution. The Commander 618 AOC (TACC), PACAF 613 AOC/AMD, and the
USAFE 603 AOC/AMD, or his/her designated representative will establish distribution
requirements of this AFI.
1.12. Transfer of Flight Managers. After transferring from one MAJCOM to another, before
an FM can work unsupervised, the gaining MAJCOM will review and assess their qualification
and currency.

                                     INITIAL TRAINING

2.1. Description. This chapter specifies the minimum training requirements for FM initial
training. All FMs will complete initial training prior to entering Mission Qualification training.
Initial training includes the FAA Aircraft Dispatcher training and certification.
2.2. Initial Training. The goal of initial training is to produce a student FM with a basic
understanding of the roles and responsibilities of an FAA licensed aircraft dispatcher roles, and
responsibilities. FAA certification as an aircraft dispatcher provides a solid conceptual and
technical foundation for students entering into Mission Qualification training. Accordingly,
student FMs must complete an FAA-Approved Aircraft Dispatch Course and take and pass the
written, practical, and oral certification examinations culminating in the award of an FAA
Aircraft Dispatcher certificate prior to entry into follow-on MQT. Student FMs who already
possess an FAA Aircraft Dispatch Certificate may be required to complete initial training as a
refresher without the requirement to take the written, practical and oral certification
examinations.

                                            Chapter 3

                          MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. Description. This chapter establishes minimum criteria and training requirements for FM
Mission Qualification training. The goal of Mission Qualification training is to produce a
qualified individual who can perform FM duties unsupervised. FM Mission Qualification
training is accomplished in the academic classroom and on-the-job by performing planning and
active flight following of real-world flight managed sorties under the direct supervision (see note
below) of an instructor FM. After the successful completion of MQT and a Mission
Qualification evaluation, the newly trained FM will be certified by the Director of Command and
Control 618 AOC (TACC) and/or PACAF 613 AOC/AMD, and the USAFE 603 AOC/AMD.
Once certified the individual can perform FM duties unsupervised. Table A2.1 outlines the
minimum training areas for Mission Qualification training. Additional MAJCOM specific
training will be documented in the MAJCOM supplements.
3.2. Aircraft Mission Design Series (MDS) Training. The 618 AOC (TACC), PACAF 613
AOC/AMD, and the USAFE 603 AOC/AMD have unique missions, and aircraft MDS training
should be tailored to reflect these different missions. As a minimum, MDS training will include
performance characteristics, planning factors, communications/navigation equipment, minimum
equipment list requirements, and fuel/cargo load capacity. Additional MAJCOM specific
training will be documented in the applicable MAJCOM supplement.
3.3. FM Mission Qualification Training. MQT is accomplished in an academic classroom or
similar and continues during OJT under the direct supervision of an instructor/evaluator FM in
the 618 AOC (TACC), PACAF 613 AOC/AMD, and the USAFE 603 AOC/AMD at a weapon
system (computer work station). Effective flight following of operational flight managed sorties
is another key aspect of MQT and is also accomplished under the direct supervision of an
instructor/evaluator FM. Table A2.1 lists the minimum requirements for MQT.                 NOTE:
Instructors/Evaluators will closely monitor the student FMs performance due to the effects it
may have on operational sorties. Although the student FMs training progress is important, it
should not be placed above sortie success. The instructor/evaluator is ultimately responsible for
the planning and effective flight following of the operational sortie. Direct instructor supervision
means over the shoulder, adjacent, or within the immediate vicinity of the student’s workstation.
The instructor will always be physically located in the same work area as the student.
   3.3.1. OJT Shift Work. A student FMs practical experience is achieved during OJT shift
   work, and as such, the student FM will be paired with an instructor/evaluator for each shift.
   The instructor FM will use the students training records and available sortie profiles to
   determine an optimum training plan for each shift.
   3.3.2. OJT Training Records. Each MAJCOM will develop FM training records for OJT.
   MAJCOM specific training forms will be included in the MAJCOM supplements to this
   instruction. NOTE: Use of Electronic Training Records is recommended.
3.4. Aircraft Operations/Familiarization Flight for FMs (As Required by MAJCOM).
   3.4.1. FMs are permitted to fly in Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) status IAW the
   provisions in AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable MAJCOM supplements.
   NOTE: FMs may be authorized MEP status IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM supplements to
 12                                                     AFI11-255V1 20 SEPTEMBER 2013


   participate on any flight managed by a FM.        Some destinations may require country
   clearance.
      3.4.1.1. FMs will accompany the aircrew during pre-flight sortie activities to observe all
      aspects of the air mobility mission. Participation in operations/familiarization Flights
      will broaden the FMs understanding and improve support to the aircrew. FMs who are
      physically restricted from flying will submit a waiver to the MAJCOM A3 using the
      procedures described in paragraph 1.5
      3.4.1.2. FMs will normally remain with their departure crew, however IAW AFI 11-401,
      para. 1.6.2.6.1., the FM may join a different mission to optimize training or expedite
      return to home station.
      3.4.1.3. To the maximum extent, the FM will participate in all pre-mission planning
      performed by the aircrew and observe inflight activities from the flight deck while on
      headset (if possible) from the aircraft’s jump seat. Direct interface between the FM is
      essential to maximize training/familiarization of flight operations.
3.5. FM Certification and Decertification. See AFI 11-255, Volume 2, Flight Manager
Evaluation Criteria for FM certification and decertification requirements. All 618 AOC
(TACC), PACAF 613 AOC/AMD, and the USAFE 603 AOC/AMD FMs must be certified prior
to performing unsupervised duties.
AFI11-255V1 20 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   13


                                          Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Description. This chapter establishes the minimum training in the form of periodic,
differences, ancillary, and requalification training requirements for FMs. Continuation training
requires an FM to complete a minimum number of sorties on a monthly/quarterly basis to
maintain currency. Periodic Training will be accomplished prior to FMs being scheduled for
their periodic evaluations (see AFI 11-255 Volume 2, Flight Manager Evaluation Criteria).
4.2. Continuation Training. The goal of FM continuation training is to ensure a certified FM
maintains currency in assigned tasks while performing FM duties. An FM is non-current if they
fail to plan 24 sorties per month. FMs on staff or supervisors who do not perform 12 sorties per
quarter can be considered non-current. A non-current FM will regain currency by performing
FM duties under the direct supervision of an instructor/ evaluator. Currency requirements are
defined within this instruction (see Table 4.1), MAJCOM’s will delineate minimum currency
requirements in their MAJCOM Supplement.
   4.2.1. FMs Currency (see Table 4 1). Staff/supervisory FMs performing
   instructor/evaluator duties may count up to 6 sorties while performing instructor/evaluator
   FM duties (dual-log), but these 6 sorties must be performed as the primary FM. Likewise,
   instructors not in a staff or supervisory position may dual-log 12 sorties while performing
   instructor FM duties, but 12 sorties must be performed as the primary FM. MAJCOM
   specific currency requirements will be included in the MAJCOM supplement. Individuals
   delinquent in one or more currency events will be considered non-current and must be
   supervised while performing FM duties.

Table 4.1. Currency Requirements for FMs.
           Position                    Monthly Sorties                 Quarterly Sorties
FM/Instructor FM                            24*                              N/A
Staff/Supervisory FMs                      N/A                               12*

*Instructor FMs can dual log up to 50 percent of their requirements and staff/supervisory FMs
performing instructor/evaluator duties can dual-log 50 percent of their requirements. See
paragraph 4.2.1. above.

       4.2.1.1. Completion and tracking of currency is ultimately the responsibility of
       individual FMs.
   4.2.2. Loss of Currency.
       4.2.2.1. FMs. FMs are non-current the day after currency expires. For example, an FM
       who is current for the month of January, but flight-manages less than 24 sorties in
       February will become non-current on 1 March.
       4.2.2.2. Staff/Supervisory FMs. The Quarterly periods for Staff/Supervisory FM
       currency run from 1 January through 31 March, 1 April through 30 June, 1 July through
       30 September and 1 October through 31 December. A staff/supervisory FM who does
14                                                      AFI11-255V1 20 SEPTEMBER 2013


     not complete currency requirements will be considered non-current the day after the
     quarter expires.
     4.2.2.3. A non-current FM may not perform FM duties unless under the direct
     supervision of an instructor/evaluator FM.
  4.2.3. Failure to Complete Training Requirements. Declare FMs non-current if they fail
  to maintain currency or fail to complete their continuation training requirements. The
  following guidance applies:
     4.2.3.1. FMs who are non-current and have not performed duties for one month not to
     exceed 179 days can regain currency by demonstrating proficiency to an
     instructor/evaluator FM. The training accomplished and the assessment of performance
     will be documented and included in the individual’s training folder.
     4.2.3.2. FMs who are non-current less than 90 days, the FMs supervisor will determine
     when the individual is ready to perform FM duties unsupervised.
     4.2.3.3. FMs that are non-current in excess of 90 days must be recertified by the Director
     of Command and Control 618 AOC (TACC) and/or PACAF 613 AOC/AMD, and the
     USAFE 603 AOC/AMD or their designated representative, prior to performing FM duties
     unsupervised.
     4.2.3.4. FMs who have not performed duties in excess of 180 days, but less than 1 year,
     must accomplish periodic training and be supervised by an instructor/evaluator FM for a
     minimum of two weeks. If warranted, an evaluation may be administered. MAJCOMs
     will identify which currency items result in an unqualified status requiring requalification
     and which currency items do not result in an unqualified status allowing currency to be
     regained according to paragraph 4.2.3. above. Regardless of whether a requalification
     evaluation is required, the Director of Command and Control 618 AOC (TACC) and/or
     PACAF 613 AOC/AMD, and the USAFE 603 AOC/AMD or his/her designated
     representative must recertify the FM prior to the FM performing duties unsupervised.
  4.2.4. Regaining Currency.
     4.2.4.1. For loss of currency less than 90 days, an FM must demonstrate proficiency
     under the supervision of an FM instructor.
     4.2.4.2. If a non-current FM fails to regain currency within 90 days they will be
     decertified.
     4.2.4.3. If a non-current FM fails to regain currency within one year of becoming non-
     current, the FM is unqualified and a requalification evaluation is required for
     recertification. The FM Supervisor will send a recommendation to the Director of
     Command and Control 618 AOC (TACC), PACAF 613 AOC/AMD, or the USAFE 603
     AOC/AMD or their designated representative, on whether the FM should be allowed to
     continue in the program. The Director of Command and Control 618 AOC (TACC),
     PACAF 613 AOC/AMD, or the USAFE 603 AOC/AMD or his/her designated
     representative will have the ultimate authority to return the FM to training status or
     convene a Flight Manager Evaluation Board (FMEB). The FMEB will consist of: The
     individual making the decertification recommendation; the individual’s immediate
     supervisor; the Chief of the Flight Management Division; a Union representative (if
AFI11-255V1 20 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  15


       required) and will be chaired by the Director of Command and Control 618 AOC
       (TACC), Chief 613 AOC/AMD, or the Chief 603 AOC/AMD or his/her designated
       representative. The FMEB will review pertinent performance documentation and
       circumstances and either determine a course of action to attain recertification or direct
       removal of the individual from the Flight Management program.
4.3. Periodic Training Requirements. Table A3.1 lists the suggested minimum training topics
for FM periodic training. Periodic training is intended to maintain and raise FMs knowledge in
procedures and mission requirements. The lecture/discussion format provides an excellent forum
to present new information or new programs, present topics requiring additional emphasis and
share information and lessons learned from the experiences of qualified FMs. Accomplishing
periodic training is one of the requisites for individuals who have not performed FM duties for
over 180 days to become recurrent. The AMC Chief, 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCM, or USAFE
Chief, 603 AOC/AMCT, or PACAF Chief ,613 AOC/AMDM or their designated representative
will prescribe the curriculum for periodic training. This curriculum will be updated annually
and/or change in source documents. MAJCOM specific periodic training requirements will be
documented in the MAJCOM supplements to this instruction.
   4.3.1. FM Training Records. All periodic training events will be recorded in the
   individual’s training record. Training events conducted during periodic training may be
   consolidated under one entry.
   4.3.2. Responsibilities
       4.3.2.1. FM Supervisors. Supervisors are responsible to schedule and ensure FMs
       complete periodic training.
       4.3.2.2. FMs. FM periodic training will be designated on the FMs individual’s schedule.
       It is the responsibility of each individual to attend periodic training when scheduled.
   4.3.3. FM Eligibility Period. The eligibility period for periodic training begins six months
   prior to the last day of the individual’s current qualification. The individual’s qualification
   month and expiration date will be established following the initial certification date. For
   example, an FM whose initial qualification month is January 2013 will be eligible for the
   periodic qualification examination and evaluation between 1 January 2014 and 30 June 2014.
   4.3.4. Failure to Complete Periodic Training Requirements. Completion of periodic
   training is a prerequisite for being scheduled for a periodic evaluation. FMs who fail to
   complete periodic training requirements prior to the last day of their most current
   qualification period will be unqualified. An unqualified FM must be supervised by an
   instructor/evaluator FM until their periodic training is complete and they successfully pass an
   evaluation.
4.4. Difference Training. Expanding roles and responsibilities and evolving technological
require specific focused training to bridge the gap between current capability and future
capabilities, requirements and responsibilities. Difference training is designed to build on
current knowledge and skills, and prepares FMs for future requirements.
4.5. Ancillary Training. This training contributes to mission accomplishment, but is separate
from an Air Force specialty code or occupational series. Examples of ancillary training includes:
DoD Information Assurance, Force Protection, Human Relations, Information Protection, etc.

NOTE: 618 AOC (TACC), PACAF 613 AOC/AMD, or USAFE 603 AOC/AMD Chief of
Flight Management or their designated representative may identify additional training
requirements in local operating instructions.
4.6. Requalification (REQUAL) Training. REQUAL training will be tailored to meet the
needs of the student. For FMs unqualified for 1 – 3 years, REQUAL training may consist of
portions of FM mission qualification academic training and OJT. For FMs unqualified for more
than 3 years, REQUAL training will consist of both the academic and OJT Mission Qualification
training. In either case, at the conclusion of training the individual must pass an FM evaluation
and be certified before performing FM duties unsupervised.
AFI11-255V1 20 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                     17

                                    UPGRADE TRAINING

5.1. Description. This chapter identifies requirements for FM upgrade training. FMs
completing initial, mission qualification training and certification are qualified to perform basic
FM responsibilities. MAJCOM’s will identify additional training, evaluation and/or certification
requirements for instructor and evaluator upgrades in their MAJCOM supplement. AMC Chief,
618 AOC (TACC)/XOCM, or USAFE Chief, 603 AOC/AMCT, and PACAF Chief ,613
AOC/AMDM will identify specific duties requiring Upgrade training, such as, FM Lead,
Mission Expansion (ME), and Air Traffic Management Coordinator (ATM). These additional
training requirements will be documented in the appropriate MAJCOM supplement. Additional
training and/or certification are required for the duties listed in paragraph 5.2 and paragraph 5.3
5.2. Instructor FM. Instructor candidates will be selected based on experience, judgment,
ability to instruct, skills, and technical knowledge. Individuals designated and certified for
upgrade to instructors should have at least one year experience as an FM. MAJCOM’s will
document instructor upgrade training requirements in their respective supplements. Individuals
designated as Instructor FMs are qualified to instruct at any level in which they are qualified.
   5.2.1. Instructor FM Responsibilities.
       5.2.1.1. Instructors will begin each training session with an overview of training
       objectives, a clear delineation of work to include specific sorties to be planned and flight
       watched and any required instructor reviews during the training session, i.e. review of
       aircrew departure papers before they are filed or published. At the conclusion of the
       training session, the instructor will provide a thorough debrief, and, provide
       recommendations for the next training session.
       5.2.1.2. Instructors will review the individual’s OJT training records prior to each shift in
       order to develop a shift training plan. After each training period, instructors will
       document training in sufficient detail to assess student performance and make
       recommendations for subsequent training.
       5.2.1.3. Instructors will ensure all required training items are completed, signed off, and
       proficiency demonstrated before recommending a student for evaluation and/or
       certification. Instructors should further ensure the student’s supervisor or the designated
       representative is apprised of the student’s status and ensures all items are completed
       before recommending a supervisory review.
       5.2.1.4. Instructors are responsible for the execution of all assigned sorties during the
       training session. Should the student’s judgment or proficiency pose a question in the
       instructor’s mind as to the student’s ability to safely manage the sortie, the instructor will
       immediately take primary responsibility for managing the sortie. The instructor will
       explain and demonstrate the correct methods and procedures for the sortie. The
       Instructors will ensure the student’s supervisor is apprised of the student’s performance.
5.3. Evaluator FM. Experienced Instructors will be recommended for evaluator certification
and must possess satisfactory knowledge of training and evaluation policies and procedures and
possess the ability to administer evaluations according to AFI 11-255, Volume 2, Flight
 18                                                    AFI11-255V1 20 SEPTEMBER 2013


Manager Evaluation Criteria. Evaluators should have at least six months experience as an
Instructor FM. Evaluators are qualified to conduct examinations at any level in which they are
qualified.
5.4. MAJCOM Specific Duties.
   5.4.1. AMC. AMC as the MAF lead command for MAF Flight Management will maintain a
   Command Flight Manager position that ensures MAF FMs requirements, training,
   evaluation, and procedures are maintained throughout the MAF community. MAJCOMs
   may specify roles and responsibilities for MAJCOM specific positions in their MAJCOM
   supplement.
