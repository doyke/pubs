1. Facility Manager Appointment.
     1.1. Designation and assignment of primary facility manager, alternate facility manager and
     organizational building representative (OBR). Each organizational commander will submit a
     letter of appointment or a TINKER AFB Form 545, Facility Manager Appointment Form,
     Figure 1.1., to Real Property at 72 ABW/CECR to appoint a primary facility manager,
     alternate facility manager and/or OBR. Information in this file will only be used for purposes
     relating to assigned duties.
     1.2. Facility manager training is required for each facility manager, alternate facility
     manager and OBR. Training is not required before the appointment of a facility
     manager/OBR but should be completed within 30 days of appointment. Training is provided
     by      72      ABW/CECR          on-line     via     the      Tinker      web        at
     https//wwwmil.tinker.af.mil/72abw/ce/RealProperty/realproperty.htm          .      Any
     manager/OBR that has not had the required training at the time of appointment will be
TINKERAFBH32-9001 26 FEBRUARY 2010                                                             3


  notified of the training requirement and given a link to the Real Property web page, along
  with a list of what they will find on the web page.
  1.3. The organizational commander will notify 72 ABW/CECR at least 10 days prior to any
  change in primary facility managers, alternate facility managers or OBRs. At the time of
  permanent change of duty station, separation, transfer to another location or termination of
  employment, the individual will obtain clearance from the Real Property Department.
     1.3.1. REAL PROPERTY MANAGER
            72 ABW/CECR
            Bldg 414
            Telephone: 734-8443
            Fax: 734-3102
  1.4. The organization using the largest amount of space within a facility will be responsible
  for the appointment of a primary and alternate facility manager. To accommodate the other
  using organizations, each respective division/squadron commander may appoint one OBR.
  The OBR will be responsible for their area within the building, not unlike the manner in
  which the facility manager is responsible for the entire building.
  1.5. Contractors or contractor representatives may be assigned as real property facility
  managers when (a) provisions for such assignments are in the best interest of the government
  and contained in the Performance Work Statement, and (b) when the buildings are provided
  to the contractor as government furnished facilities necessary to perform the contract, and the
  contractor and/or personnel will be the sole or primary occupant or user. It is the
  responsibility of the organizational commander and facility manager to ensure compliance
  with this handbook and all other applicable directives by the facility manager, alternate
  facility manager and OBR. The facility manager is to provide guidance to the alternate and
  OBR in the correct procedures for accomplishing the duties and responsibilities of this
  instruction. The primary and alternate managers, and OBRs, should work as a team to ensure
  the facility is managed effectively and efficiently.

2. Facility Manager Responsibility.
   2.1. Maintain a maintenance request folder for each facility assigned.
   2.2. Conduct monthly visual inspections of the facility for drafty or broken windows and
   doors, damaged electrical fixtures, leaking plumbing, dirty vents, etc. to determine the
   condition of the property, using AF Form 2519, All Purpose Checklist, Figure 2.1. Inspect
   all interior areas such as closets, stairwells, entrances, hallways and office areas for neatness
   and cleanliness. Notify area occupants of any poor housekeeping and ensure corrective action
   is taken. Housekeeping within equipment and mechanical rooms is solely the responsibility
   of 72 ABW/CECO. Report unsecured mechanical rooms to the Customer Service Center,
   734-3117.
   2.3. Survey all assigned areas and submit work requests, if required, to ensure removal of
   handicap barriers. Any questions regarding the American Disabilities Act may be referred to
   72 ABW/CECEE, 734-2868.
      2.3.1. INTERIOR DESIGN
             72 ABW/CECEE
             Bldg 400
             Telephone: 734-2868
             Fax: 734-5538
   2.4. Brief the users of the facility on their collective responsibility for the care, custody and
   protection of the property. Ensure that facility users do not alter the arrangement of or
   move/remove: water, heating, lighting, ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing and related
   fixtures, or other real property installed equipment.
   2.5. Jointly publish rules for opening and closing the facility during normal duty hours and
   for after-hours admittance and use (including security measures to be observed). These rules
   should include procedures for coordinating with the energy monitors to ensure maximum
   conservation of energy while the facility is closed.
   2.6. Ensure that assigned space is used as approved by the base Facilities Board and the
   Space Working Group, 72 ABW/CEAO, 734-2074. A good practice is to have floor plans of
   the facility and outline which organizations occupy which areas within the building.
   2.7. Fire prevention must be an integral part of the facility manager’s monthly facility
   inspections. When the facility manager identifies a fire hazard or deficiency, corrective
   action must be initiated immediately. Fire inspectors will request the facility manager
   accompany them during annual fire prevention assessments. The facility manager will be
   advised of any discrepancies noted. Ensure follow-up corrective action is taken on all
   discrepancies and irregularities that are found during fire inspections. Compliance with fire
   safety guidelines as defined in AFOSHSTD 91-501, Air Force Consolidated Occupational
   Safety Standard, is required. Fire prevention is everyone’s responsibility. Facility managers
   must continually enforce fire-safe practices. For more information about fire safety and
   prevention, contact 72 ABW/CEFT, 734-3981.

  2.8. Fire extinguishers must be inspected monthly for serviceability. A program shall be
  established to track each fire extinguisher from cradle to grave and document monthly
  checks. Facility managers shall budget for the purchase and maintenance of fire extinguishers
  to comply with AFOSHSTD 91-501. See the Fire Department web site
  https://wwwmil.tinker.af.mil/firedept for more information on fire extinguishers.
  2.9. When permanently vacating a facility, ensure all government and/or personal property is
  removed, the interior of the facility is cleaned and fire hazards are removed. Upon
  completion of these tasks, notify Real Property (72 ABW/CECR), 734-8443, for a joint
  inventory and inspection of the facility. If the inventory and inspection are acceptable and all
  keys are turned in for the facility, 72 ABW/CECR will relieve the organization of
  responsibility for the facility.
  2.10. The facility manager in conjunction with the unit emergency management (UEMR)
  representative need to identify protective tornado shelter locations in all unit facilities (see
  CEMP Plan 10-2 Annex B, Natural Disasters). The tornado shelter areas must be identified
  with Tinker approved shelter signs which are unit funded. Contact 72 ABW/CEX for sources
  of signs.
  2.11. The facility manager in conjunction with the unit emergency management (UEMR)
  representative must have a plan for in-place sheltering and/or evacuation for terrorist
  weapons of mass destruction incidents. The plan must be developed, briefed to all unit
  personnel and maintained in the Tab C of the unit emergency management handbook. In-
  place sheltering and/or evacuation are outlined in CEMP Plan 10-2, Appendix 5 to Annex D.

   minor maintenance and self-help work, the facility manager/OBR will enter the following
   items on the Maintenance Request Register as a minimum: complete description of work
   being requested, location of work, room number, etc., avenue used to request work, date
   submitted or time called in, service call job order or work request number given by 72
   ABW/CECOW, and date of completion. If the facility manager/OBR has more than one
   building, a separate maintenance request register for each facility is required.
5. AF Form 332, BCE Work Request. AF Form 332 will be used to request modifications,
renovations, installations, maintenance and repair, or new work/construction to assigned real
property or real property installed equipment. This form will be used for in-house work, contract
work, self-help work and work done as a result of facility abuse or ordinary wear and tear.
   5.1. Requester (Section I Blocks 1-3, 5-7 & 11-13): The facility manager or OBR will
   prepare an AF Form 332, and retain one copy for the facility manager’s files. When possible,
   all requirements for a single facility will be included in a single AF Form 332 submission.

       unless contract is generated within Civil Engineering.
       5.4.5. If NONE, please ―X‖ this box.
   5.5. Coordination (Section I Block 14): Coordination with agencies other than 72
   ABW/CEC is the responsibility of the organization submitting the work request. Minimal
   coordination requirements for work other than routine maintenance and repair are Fire Dept,
   Environmental Management and Safety. Routine minor maintenance and repair does not
   require coordination. If this is a self-help project, inform the self-help department if you need
   shop support (i.e., electrical, fire sprinkler, plumbing or HVAC). 72 ABW/CECOW
   Customer Service, 734-3117, can assist you with coordination.
   5.6. Estimated Costs (Section III Blocks 20 & 21): When using self-help, provide an
   estimate for labor and material costs. Attach a list of materials that will be used to
   accomplish the project and if applicable, as-built drawings with alterations and changes. As-
   builts are also required when installing ceiling or flooring materials.
   5.7. Submit written requests well in advance so that accomplishment is within a realistic
   time frame. Allow time for the AF Form 332 to be processed and planned. Under the Work
   Order Allocation Program the respective Work Allocation Board will review each AF
   Form 332. After approval by the board and priority placement, the work order will be
   assigned a number by 72 ABW/CECOW.
6. Self-Help. Self-help is a great way to get some low priority work accomplished. There are
many instances where an individual or organization may desire to do their own work. In these
instances, the requester furnishes the work force and has the option of furnishing the materials.
In deciding whether or not to approve the self-help request, the self-help representative must
determine:
   6.1. if the work is required. whether the requester has the technical capability and resources
   available to do the job. what support will be required. whether it would be economical for the
   requester to donate the necessary labor and materials.
   6.2. It must be recognized that self-help may not always be cost effective. Civil Engineering
   is ultimately responsible for work on real property and consequently, may have to correct
   deficiencies created by self-help work. Therefore, materials furnished by the requester must
TINKERAFBH32-9001 26 FEBRUARY 2010                                                             13


   meet Air Force standards of quality and be approved by the Fire Department (72 ABW/CEF)
   and Civil Engineering.
   6.3. Materials must be requisitioned within 30 days of self-help approval of AF Form 332.
   The self-help scheduler will notify the requester to pick up material (if furnished by 72
   ABW/CEC) and begin work. All self-help work must be completed within 90 days of
   receiving material. Upon completion of self-help work, all furnished excess material will be
   turned in to the self-help department (72 ABW/CECOW). The self-help department may
   assign a job monitor for minor construction projects who will conduct periodic inspections
   until the project is completed. Notify the self-help department upon completion or
   cancellation of self-help work order requests.

              Telephone: 734-5530
              Fax: 734-3199
   6.4. Self-help Cards: Self-help cards are another option permitting customers to obtain
   minor maintenance materials for small fix-it-up projects without submitting an AF Form 332.
   Facility managers/ OBRs are issued self-help cards to purchase minor maintenance items
   such as paint and accessories, outlet covers, and ceiling tiles. There is a limit of $50.00 a
   month per organization and building. Batteries, dorm cleaning supplies, tools/flashlights, and
   vehicle supplies cannot be purchased with the self-help card.
   6.5. AF Purchase Card Program: In accordance with Air Force Instruction 32-1001,
   Operations Management, prior to commencing any work that will repair, modify, or
   construct a real property facility, all base organizations must submit, and have approved, an
   AF Form 332. The proposed work must result in a complete and usable facility and the total
   cost of the work must be under $2,000. Separate billing of work items to avoid this limit is
   prohibited.
7. Projects by Contract. There are many instances when needed work is beyond the scope of
in-house capabilities. In this case, a facility project-by-contract may be needed. As the facility
manager, the first person to contact about projects would be your Facilities Board Working
Group (FBWG) member. Your FBWG member is your advocate for facility projects. 72
ABW/CECR can assist you in determining your FBWG member.

         Fax: 734-3102
   7.2. Submittals: Facility projects by contract are requested on an AF Form 332, in the same
   manner as any other work request. Once the work request has been processed through the
   Work Order Review Board and the recommendation made to accomplish the work via
   contract, it will be assigned a project number. It is important that the work request include a
   thorough description of the work to be accomplished and a complete justification. Supporting

   documents, such as drawings and design specifications, Risk Assessment Codes (RAC),
   and/or Fire Safety Deficiency Codes (FSDC), provide information that can further define the
   cost of a project, the time requirements for completion and the fund source. Based on the
   information provided, the work will be classified as ―maintenance‖, ―repair‖ or
   ―construction‖. The programming avenue will be established and the project approval
   documents will be generated. Facility projects by contract require time for accomplishment,
   so facility managers need to plan ahead.
   7.3. Timeline: From project planning to construction, the contract process can run 2-5 years
   depending on the program avenue selected.

Table 7.1. Timeline
            Operations and Maintenance (O&M):                               2 years
            P-341 Unspecified Minor Construction (urgent):                  1 year
            Military Construction (MILCON):                                 5 years
            Military Family Housing (MFH):                                  2-5
                                                                    years
            Non-Appropriated Funds (NAF):                                   2-4
                                                                    years
   7.4. Fund Sources: There are several different fund sources available based on the program
   avenue selected. Outside of tenant or other local fund sources, the list includes:

Table 7.2. Fund Sources
            Sustainment, Restoration & Modernization by Contract
            Defense Energy Supply Center
            Environmental Compliance
            MILCON Program Funds
            Defense Medical Funds
            NAF: Services, AAFES, Civilian Welfare Fund
            Utility Energy Services Contracts for Energy Conservation
   7.5. Facility Sustainment Model (FSM)/Facilities Investment Metric (FIM): Prioritizing
   facility projects for inclusion into fund-source programs is a difficult task, in that it requires
   input from the user, functional experts, reports/studies, FBWG members, and the Facilities
   Board. The FSM is the Department of Defense’s method of classifying facility work as either
   sustainment, or restoration and modernization. Sustainment supports maintenance and repair
   activities necessary to keep an inventory of facilities in good working order, including
   preventive maintenance tasks and scheduled minor/ major repair (including replacement of
   old systems) within expected life cycles. Restoration and modernization supports repair and
   replacement work to restore damaged facilities due to accident or failure attributable to
   inadequate sustainment, excessive age, or other causes. It also supports alteration of facilities
   to implement a new, higher standard, to accommodate new functions, or to replace building
   components that typically last more than 50 years. To further identify and stratify facility
   projects, and determine funds requirements, the Air Force applies the FIM. FIM assesses a
   project’s impact on the installation’s mission, and its relative order of importance. Each
   project will be assigned an impact rating. Sustainment projects are considered preventative
TINKERAFBH32-9001 26 FEBRUARY 2010                                                            15


   maintenance level and require advanced planning and scheduling to prevent mission impact.
   Restoration and modernization will be assigned one of three FIM impact ratings:
      7.5.1. Critical: Significant loss of installation/tenant mission capability
             Frequent mission interruptions
             Work-arounds continuously needed
             RAC or FSDC of 1
      7.5.2. Degraded:
             Limited loss of installation/tenant mission capability
             Work-arounds to prevent mission disruption and degradation are frequent
             RAC or FSDC of 2 or 3
      7.5.3. Essential: Marginal or no adverse impact to installation/tenant mission capability
             Work-arounds are seldom required
8. Keys and Locks.
   8.1. Key Control and Duplication: Locks for facilities and associated real property will be
   changed by 72 ABW/CECOSL personnel. No organization other than 72 ABW/CECOSL on
   Tinker AFB shall reproduce keys or obtain keys, cores, locks, padlocks, or cylinders for real
   property. The use of off-base locksmiths for work on real property items without Civil
   Engineering coordination is prohibited.

      8.1.2. Requests for keys, cores, and locks will be on an TINKER AFB Form 325,
      Request for Lock Work or an AF 332, signed and submitted by the facility
      manager/OBR. Re-keying of a facility will be by submission of AF Form 332 to 72
      ABW/CECOSL. Keys are then distributed by the facility manager/OBR to appropriate
      personnel via AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt. A record of all keys issued will
      be kept current and complete by the facility manager/OBR.
   8.2. Lock and Core Installation: Facility managers/OBRs will submit an AF Form 332, or
   TINKER AFB Form 325 to the Lock Shop for keys or core changes for their facilities or the
   keying of new construction projects. The Lock Shop will establish the required DSWs.
      8.2.1. Prior to changing key codes or contractor cores, the locksmith will notify the
      facility manager/OBR to pick up the new keys as soon as possible and the locksmith will
      then proceed to make all required changes. The facility manager/OBR will collect all old
      keys for turn-in to 72 ABW/ CECOSL.
   8.3. Exceptions:
      8.3.1. Service contract keys (including custodial keys) will be requested and issued to the
      contractor by the facility manager/OBR after coordination with the Service Contract
      Section (72 ABW/ CEES). Upon issuance of keys, the facility manager/OBR will supply

   8.4. Grand Master and Master Keys:
       8.4.1. Grand master keys and other master keys for areas not under the base grand master
       system will be issued only to the base commander (72 ABW/CC) upon request. Issuance
       of master keys will be coordinated through the on-duty Flight Chief or designee at the
       Force Protection Operations Center, 72d Security Forces Squadron.
       8.4.2. To be considered a master key, the key must have the capability of opening the
       locks in more than one facility, with different key codes in each facility. To be considered
       a sub-master key, it must be capable of opening all the locks in one facility when the key
       code is different for each lock. The person to whom keys are issued is the person
       responsible for the use of the keys.
   8.5. Broken and Lost Dorm Keys: Damage or loss of a key due to theft, misuse, or
   negligence must be reported to the Dormitory Manager and the key holder will have to
   reimburse the government for the replacement cost of the key.

   any questions regarding cipher locks and associated equipment, please contact the Lock Shop
   at 739-5625. CE will maintain the structural part of doors and gates, and the best compatible
   lock system, but cannot maintain user installed lock systems.
9. Energy Conservation. The facility manager/OBR is the key to an effective utilities
conservation program. A primary function of the facility manager/OBR is to support energy
conservation through cooperative effort with the organization energy manager. With the support
of supervisors and commanders, they can ensure that the personnel using their facilities do not
waste energy or utilities. Facility managers/OBRs shall adhere to the following guidelines.
Corrective action should be taken when unable to do so.

   supervisor. Note: Space heaters are excluded from use unless medically approved.
   9.7. Turn off machines such as fans, typewriters, calculators, copy machines or other
   electrical equipment when not in actual use.
10. Facility Abuse. Management of facility abuse is a continuing item of interest throughout
the Air Force. The facility manager, OBR, organizational commander, base civil engineer, and
the base commander all play an integral part in identifying, investigating, and resolving any
possible instances of facility abuse. Facility abuse can be defined as any damage or loss which is
due to misconduct or negligence in the use, care, custody or safeguarding of real property
facilities or systems.
   10.1. When the facility manager/OBR finds damage to the facility or installed equipment,
   which is suspected to have been caused by abuse, it will be reported to the commander and
   an investigation will be initiated by the facility manager/OBR. If the damage is the result of
   misconduct, and the liability has been affixed, the commander will submit an AF Form 332
   with a statement of acceptance in item 27, signed by the individual admitting liability. A
   suspense file will be established to ensure the debt is cleared.
   10.2. When civil engineering personnel identify, or are notified of a possible facility abuse
   case, the operations manager will investigate the damage. A letter will be sent to the
   organizational commander requesting an investigation. Repairs will not be made by Civil
 18                                             TINKERAFBH32-9001 26 FEBRUARY 2010


   Engineering (unless otherwise approved) until the organizational commander investigates the
   situation and completes a facility abuse action letter to the base civil engineer. If specific
   liability cannot be established, the work in question will be completed as soon as possible
   charging all cost to the organization.
      10.2.1. The organization commander’s reply to the abuse letter will be routed through
      the base civil engineer and to the base commander for final approval of action taken.
      10.2.2. A suspense file will be maintained in all abuse cases by the Customer Service
      Center and a follow-up will be completed to ensure the earliest possible closing of the
      case. The file will contain, but not be limited to, the AF Form 20, Repair Cost and
      Reparable Value Statement; diagrams, photographs when available, Security Forces
      reports and statements of witnesses. This file will also include the action taken by the
      organizational commander; the DD Form 362, Statement of Charges/Cash Collection
      Voucher; DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher; or other applicable forms and one
      copy of the actual repair cost, if the individual pays for the damage.
      10.2.3. If it is determined that an individual is liable as a result of a report of survey, or
      the individual voluntarily accepts pecuniary liability, the Customer Service Center will
      furnish cost of repairs (based upon completed Work Order Cost Report) to the Defense
      Accounting Office (DAO) (OC-ALC/DAO-DE) according to DoDR 7000-14 Vol. 4. The
      DAO will process the appropriate collection document for the collection of charges to the

Terms
AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request—A document used by organizations to
request specific types of work, generally minor construction, self-help, or work required because
of facility abuse. This form is also used by the facility manager/OBR to identify to Civil
Engineering routine maintenance and repair requirements that do not meet the emergency criteria
for a service call or are not urgent in nature.
AF Form 327, Base Civil Engineer Work Order—A work authorization document used by
Civil Engineering which identifies time and material requirements for a specific plan of work. It
provides the detailed planning and controls necessary for the efficient accomplishment of large
or complex jobs.
Alternate Facility Manager—Performs the tasks of the facility manager in the absence or
unavailability of the facility manager.
Direct Schedule Work Order (DSW)—This document authorizes work accomplishment by
emergency, urgent, or routine service calls. DSWs are intended to serve as a simplified method
of work processing which reduces the administrative workload when detailed planning is not
required and materials are normally available.
Emergency Service Call—Any work required to correct an emergency condition that is
detrimental to the mission or reduces operational effectiveness. It includes providing security to
areas subject to compromise or protecting high value property and equipment. An emergency
includes, as a minimum: the failure of any utility, fire protection, environmental control, security
alarm system or clogged plumbing. Service calls will be completed without delay regardless of
overtime requirements or other restrictive factors.
Excavation (Dig) Permit—Dig permits are required for any disturbance of the ground surface
anywhere on base. All personnel needing to penetrate the ground on Tinker (excavators) are
TINKERAFBH32-9001 26 FEBRUARY 2010                                                               21


required to obtain approval from base Civil Engineering before they dig. The Tinker Excavation
Permit Request form and maps may be picked up at Engineering Support, building 400, second
floor, 734-2869. The area of excavation must be clearly marked with paint or flags. All requests
should be submitted to Engineering Support at least one week prior to actual excavation.
Facility—A separate individual building or other structure.
Facility Abuse—Any damage or loss which is due to misconduct or negligence in the use, care,
custody or safeguarding of real property facilities or systems.
In—Place Sheltering—A short-term protective measure used in case of hazardous material
release. A hazardous material release may be caused by an accident or intentional release by a
terrorist group. You may hear the term Weapons of Mass Destruction Incident or WMD.
Job Monitor—The individual in Civil Engineering who is assigned the responsibility for
monitoring self-help projects.
Maintenance Request Continuity Folder—This folder will be used and maintained by the
facility manager/OBR to collect all identified work requirements for the facility. It will be passed
on by the out-going facility manager/OBR to the next facility manager/OBR. This folder will
contain, as a minimum, a copy of this handbook, and a Maintenance Request Register. NOTE:
Facility managers must also maintain a list of all organizational building representatives assigned
to their facility.
Maintenance Request Register—A log of requests for maintenance, repair, construction, or
self-help projects submitted to Civil Engineering. This register will be maintained by the facility
manager to track requests from initial submission to completion of work or other final
disposition.
Organizational Building Representative (OBR)—A person who may be appointed by their
commander (directorate, division, or squadron level). This individual is responsible for a
designated area of a multi-organization facility.
Organizational Commander—The commander (directorate, division, or squadron level) of an
organization using space in a facility. The commander is responsible for ensuring compliance
with the requirements of this handbook.
Primary Facility Manager—A person appointed by the organizational commander (directorate,
division, or squadron level) according to the requirements of this handbook and other applicable
directives. This person will be the primary point of contact for the organization for items covered
in this handbook.
Real Property Accountable Officer—The individual (military or civilian) designated on orders
from the installation commander to maintain a real property accountable record.
Routine Service Call—A routine system that has been developed for those jobs which should be
accomplished within 30 days, but do not qualify as urgent or emergency. The idea is to separate
the base into zones and use a routine designation by zone to accomplish work requirements. On a
recurring basis of less than one month, requirements for a particular zone are extracted, materials
are gathered, skills assembled and the work is scheduled. The consolidation of work
requirements using this method enables Civil Engineering to more effectively use the work force
and minimize the number of dispatches to a specific area.

Self—help Work—Work performed on real property facilities by an individual or group outside
the Civil Engineering organization. This work will be requested on an AF Form 332, prior to the
work being accomplished, and authorized by Civil Engineering according to AFI 32-1098, Base
Civil Engineering Self-Help guide. TINKERAFBH32-9001 26 FEBRUARY 2010 23
Urgent Service Call—Used for minor maintenance and repair requirements that are not
emergencies, but should be accomplished within five days after identification. Examples of work
that could qualify as urgent include leaky faucets or sluggish drainage
