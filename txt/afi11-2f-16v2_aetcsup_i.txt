                                          Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. All evaluations will be conducted IAW the provisions of AFI 11-202V2 and this
volume.
1.2. Waivers. Waiver authority for this publication is the MAJCOM A3. Waivers will be
requested from the parent MAJCOM Stan/Eval through appropriate channels.
1.2. (AETC)Waivers. HQ AETC/A2/3/10 is the waiver authority unless otherwise specified in
this supplement. Send waiver requests through Stan/Eval channels to HQ AETC/A3V. The
operations group commander (OG/CC), or equivalent, of the unit that generated their supplement
will handle waivers to supplemental guidance.
1.3. Procedures.
   1.3.1. Flight examiners (FEs) will use the evaluation criteria contained in Chapter 3 for
   conducting flight evaluations and Chapter 4 for emergency procedure evaluations (EPE). To
   ensure standard and objective evaluations, FE will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed
   evaluation criteria.
   1.3.2. Recording devices (video recorders (DVR/VTR), air combat maneuvering
   instrumentation, etc.) should be used, when available, to reconstruct/evaluate the mission.
   1.3.3. Unless specified, the examinee or FE may fly in any flight position/seat (to include
   chase) which will best enable the FE to conduct a thorough evaluation.
   1.3.4. The FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be
   conducted prior to flight. The examinee will accomplish required flight planning in
   accordance with the flight position during the evaluation. Higher Headquarters FEs (and unit
   FEs as determined locally) may assist in mission planning/briefing as tasked and will be
   furnished a copy of necessary mission data, mission materials, and data transfer cartridge
   loads.
   1.3.5. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the evaluation. This debrief will include
   the examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than
   qualified) and any required additional training.
   1.3.6. (Added-AETC) Normally, FEs will evaluate within their aircrew specialties during
   flight evaluations. Any FE may evaluate any type of mission or qualification evaluation for
   either crew position, with the exception of the pilot Instrument/Qualification
   (INSTM/QUAL) evaluations which must be evaluated by a pilot FE. Any FE can administer
   an emergency procedures evaluation (EPE).
1.4. Grading Instructions. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-
202V2 and this instruction.
   1.4.1. Grading assumes smooth air and a stable aircraft baseline. Momentary deviations from
   tolerances are acceptable provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such
   deviations do not jeopardize flying safety. The FE will consider cumulative deviations when
   determining the overall grade.
 6                                             AFI11-2F-16V2_AETCSUP_I 18 MARCH 2013


     1.4.2. Examinees will brief and fly the desired airspeed/AOA for approaches and SFO
     parameters.
     1.4.3. Appropriate area grades will be assigned by comparing examinee performance against
     standards per Chapter 3. The overall flight evaluation grade will be derived from individual
     area grades based on a composite for the observed events and tasks.
        1.4.3.1. FE judgment must be exercised for applying subjective area grades, for specific
        situations not covered, and for assigning the overall grade.
        1.4.3.2. If the examinee receives an unqualified area grade in any of the critical areas
        identified by this volume, an overall qualification level of "Q-3" will be assigned.

Table 1.1. General Criteria.

The following general criteria apply at all times unless more restrictive
in Chapter 3:

Q         Altitude        +/- 200 feet

          Airspeed        +/- 5%

          Course          +/- 5 degrees/3 NM (whichever is greater)

          TACAN Arc       < 3 NM



Q-        Altitude        +/- 300 feet

          Airspeed        +/- 10%

          Course          +/- 10 degrees/5 NM (whichever is greater)

          TACAN Arc       > 3 NM



U                         Exceeded Q- limits
1.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation. In order of preference, the EPE will be conducted in
a flight simulator/unit training device (UTD), cockpit procedure trainer (CPT), or verbally. Only
conduct a verbal EPE if a flight simulator/UTD or CPT is not available or not configured
appropriately for the evaluation. Grading criteria for each required item are listed in Chapter 4.
This evaluation will include areas commensurate with examinee's Ready Aircrew Program
(RAP) training level and event qualifications.
     1.5.1. The following items are required on all Emergency Procedure Evaluations: All
     Critical Action Procedures (CAP) will be evaluated by the examinee completing a written
AFI11-2F-16V2_AETCSUP_I 18 MARCH 2013                                                    7


  CAP test at the beginning of the EPE and executing all CAPs during the EPE. Any
  incorrectly completed written CAP will result in a “U”. The EPE will not be started until
  successful completion of the written CAP.
     1.5.1.1. In addition to the CAP requirement in paragraph 1.5.1., additional "non-CAP"
     emergency procedures will be evaluated. Non-CAP emergency procedures will be
     selected from Table 2.2.

     1.5.4. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade will be placed in supervised status
     until recommended additional training is completed and/or a reevaluation is successfully
     accomplished. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade because of an unsatisfactory
     CAP accomplishment will not be permitted to fly until a successful reevaluation is
     accomplished. For EPEs in which the examinee is qualified, but requires additional training,
     the FE will indicate whether the additional training will be accomplished before the next
     flight. Additional training and reevaluations will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-202V2.
     1.5.5. Normally, an EPE will be conducted separately for the pilot INSTM/QUAL and MSN
     evaluations. In situations where INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluation eligibility zones
     overlap, a single EPE may be administered to fulfill the requisites for a combined
     MSN/INSTM/QUAL evaluations. The combined EPE must be of sufficient scope and length
     to ensure all required areas for each evaluation are accomplished.
     1.5.5. (AETC) In situations where WSO QUAL and MSN evaluation eligibility zones
     overlap, a single EPE may be administered to fulfill the requisites for the combined
     MSN/QUAL evaluation. The combined EPE must be of sufficient scope and length to ensure
     all required areas for each evaluation are accomplished.
     1.5.6. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs:
        1.5.6.1. Q. Performance is correct. Quickly recognizes and corrects errors.
        1.5.6.2. Q-. Performance is safe, but indicates limited proficiency. Makes errors of
        omission or commission.
        1.5.6.3. U. Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or ability.
1.6. Documentation of Weapons Employment Results. Weapons employment results will be
documented in the Mission Description Section of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
Qualification, for MSN evaluations. Include entries for each type of actual and simulated
ordnance that was employed.
     1.6.1. Air-to-Surface. Results will be recorded as Hit or Miss for each air-to-surface record
     delivery. Flight examiners may use either AFI 11-2F-16 Volume 1, F-16--Aircrew Training,
     individual weapons events or current MAJCOM Block XX RAP tasking message events (e.g.
     combined events, etc.) when determining grading or assigning additional training. Document
     results as in Table 1.2 or per PEX format.
     1.6.2. Forward Air Controller (FAC) Target Marks. For the purpose of FAC target mark,
     marks will be scored as a Hit or a Miss by the FE in either FAC or fighter aircraft. Marks will
     be scored as a "Hit" if they are considered usable for marking the designated target, delivered
     in a timely manner, and delivery used is tactically sound. They will be scored as a "Miss" if
     they are unusable for target marking, untimely, or the deliveries are tactically unsound (i.e.,
     excessive altitude loss, unnecessary exposure to the threat, excessive tracking time, etc.).
     1.6.3. Air-to-Air. Record the number of simulated missile/gun firing attempts and the
     number that were valid as in Table 1.2 Shot validity will be evaluated at pickle with all
     parameters IAW AFTTP 3-1.Shot/Kill.
     1.6.4. FE Judgment. FE judgment will be the determining factor in deciding the weapons
     employment grade. If the FE elects to award a higher area grade than warranted by the
AFI11-2F-16V2_AETCSUP_I 18 MARCH 2013                                                        9


   score(s), the FE will include the justification in the Comments Section of the AF Form 8.
   Include entries for each type of simulated ordnance that was employed.

                                          Chapter 2

                             EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General.
   2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2.
   2.1.2. Required areas for flight evaluations are detailed in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 for EPEs
   When it is impractical or not possible to accomplish a required flight evaluation area in-
   flight, it may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., simulator/UTD, CPT, or by verbal
   examination) in order to complete the evaluation. Document the reason and type of alternate
   method used in the Comments portion of the AF Form 8. If the FE determines the required
   item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate method, the examinee will require an
   additional flight to complete the evaluation.
   2.1.2. (AETC) See Attachment 2 (Added) for required WSO flight evaluation areas (Table
   A2.1 (Added)), and for WSO EPEs (Table A2.2 (Added)). See Attachment 3 (Added) for
   WSO flight evaluation criteria and Attachment 4 (Added) for WSO EPE criteria.
      2.1.2.1. Areas annotated with an "R" are required items for that evaluation.
      2.1.2.2. Areas annotated with an “R1” require evaluation of at least one of the items
      under the associated section and category for that evaluation (All CAPs are required to be
      accomplished for both INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluations).
      2.1.2.3. Areas indicated with an “R2” require evaluation of at least two of the items
      under the associated section for that evaluation (All CAPs are required to be
      accomplished for both INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluations).
   2.1.3. Publications Check.        Currency of Flight Publications. Evaluate all issued
   publications/checklists for currency and accuracy on all flight evaluations. Units may specify
   additional publications to be evaluated in the unit supplement to AFI 11-202V2.
   2.1.3. (AETC) Use the applicable flight manual publication for non-USAF F-16 units.
   2.1.4. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). In accordance with AFI 11-290,
   Cockpit/Crew Resource Management, CRM skills will be evaluated during all evaluations.
   CRM skills are integral to all phases of flight and are embedded within specific grading
   criteria. Therefore, no specific evaluation criteria area titled CRM exists. As all the CRM
   skills listed on the AF Form 4031, CRM Skills Training/ Evaluation Form, are
   included/embedded, use of the Form 4031 is unnecessary for evaluations in the F-16. The
   Stan/Eval trend program can be used to measure the effectiveness of CRM training.
   2.1.5. Combined Evaluations. With the approval of the Operations Group Commander, the
   INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluations may be combined as a single evaluation. Unit
   Commanders should recommend this option only for experienced pilots. Combined
   evaluations flown in this manner must fulfill all current INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluation
   requirements, including ground phase requisites. One EPE may be accomplished that
   encompasses requirements of both EPEs, with additional simulator time as required to
   complete all items.
AFI11-2F-16V2_AETCSUP_I 18 MARCH 2013                                                           11


2.2. Instrument/Qualification Evaluation. A mission flown according to instrument flight
rules (to the maximum extent practical) best fulfills the objective of the INSTM/QUAL
evaluation. To the maximum extent possible, this evaluation will include approaches at airfields
other than home or deployed locations (USAFE: Preferably non-US locations). Approaches may
be flown to fields which have a non-published, practice approach available (e.g. Visual Flight
Rules (VFR) conditions only approach), but not a published FLIP approach. The intent is to
grade instrument procedures which are independent of an approach’s certification (to use a non-
published approach, the approach plate must be built using the standards applied to published
approach plates, local OGV must approve use of the approach, and approval for the approach to
must be documented in the local unit supplement to AFI 11-202V2). This evaluation may be
administered on any compatible training mission. When B/D model aircraft are available, pilots
may complete their INSTM/QUAL evaluation with an FE occupying the rear cockpit.
2.2. (AETC)Instrument/Qualification Evaluation. See paragraph 2.7 (Added) for WSO
QUAL evaluations.
   2.2.1. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
       2.2.1.1. Instrument examination.
       2.2.1.2. Closed and open book qualification examinations.
       2.2.1.3. EPE.
       2.2.1.4. CAP Written Exam. Answers must contain all critical action items in proper
       sequence. Abbreviations are allowed.
2.3. Mission Evaluation. MSN evaluations will be flown IAW current tactics, unit tasking,
theater Area of Responsibility scenarios, and will incorporate all appropriate evaluation
requirements from Table 2.1 Scenarios that represent unit Designed Operational Capability
(DOC) tasking satisfy the requirements of this evaluation. The profiles will be designed to
evaluate the training/flight position/special qualifications as well as basic airmanship of the
examinee. Initial MSN evaluations will be given in the primary DOC of the unit unless directed
otherwise by the squadron commander due to assigned contingency tasking. Examinees will be
evaluated in the position of their highest qualification. At the FE’s discretion, portions may be
flown in another position, but the emphasis is to have examinees evaluated at their highest
qualification level. Wingman may be required to brief (to include tactics) and/or lead certain
phases of the mission, but will not be evaluated for flight leadership. Evaluations during
exercises or exercise deployments are encouraged. Evaluations during contingency/combat
deployments will be given as a last resort in order to maintain mission qualification status. Note:
Basic Mission Capable (BMC) aircrew will only be evaluated on those missions routinely
performed. Examinees will only be evaluated on those areas for which they are qualified.
2.3. (AETC)Mission Evaluation. See paragraph 2.7 (Added) for WSO MSN evaluations.
   2.3.1. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
       2.3.1.1. EPE.
       2.3.1.2. Air Defense qualified pilots in wings which support a full-time ASA detachment
       (or home-station alert) will complete at least one Air Sovereignty intercept during every
       Mission EPE.
 12                                            AFI11-2F-16V2_AETCSUP_I 18 MARCH 2013


       2.3.1.3. CAP Written Exam. Answers must contain all critical action items in proper
       sequence. Abbreviations are allowed.
   2.3.2. Air-to-Surface. This evaluation will include, as a minimum, navigation to the initial
   point (IP), an IP to target run, planned weapons employment and threat reactions. First-look
   navigation and look-alike targets are encouraged. For examinees that are certified Combat
   Mission Ready/BMC in nuclear and conventional tasking, the evaluation will emphasize only
   one scenario. Mission profiles should include actual delivery of practice or live ordnance.
   Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) scenarios should include simulated HARM
   employment against emitters. Ordnance deliveries may be dry if they can be validated.
   2.3.3. Air-to-Air. This evaluation will include, as a minimum, one intercept, offensive
   maneuvering and planned weapons employment. When practical, adversaries should simulate
   enemy aircraft, tactics and ordnance IAW AFTTP 3-1. Dissimilar aircraft are preferred.
   Additionally, pilots:
       2.3.3.1. Must have operable radar.
       2.3.3.2. When weather or other restrictions prohibit D/ACBT, or Low Altitude Training,
       may fly multiple intercepts.
       2.3.3.3. ASA mission evaluations will be sampled by ASA assigned units.
       2.3.3.4. DELETED
   2.3.4. Reconnaissance. A day visual sortie will be used to the maximum extent possible. A
   minimum of three targets will be assigned and more than 50 percent acquired for successful
   completion of the mission. Exceptions to the minimum number of targets are permitted for
   enhanced profiles and specialized missions. Successful acquisition of targets will be based on
   the requested elements of essential information and/or FE judgment. In-flight targets may be
   assigned by the FE. Targets not acquired due to adverse weather, verified sensor malfunction
   or threat reaction will not be charged against the pilot.
   2.3.5. FAC(A). Air-to-surface evaluation requirements/grading criteria will be used when
   determined applicable by the FE.
2.4. Formal Course Evaluation. Syllabus evaluations will be flown IAW syllabus mission
profile guidelines if stated, or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training objectives.
Formal course guidelines may be modified, based on local operating considerations or FE
judgment, to complete the evaluation. Training objectives and related areas will be graded using
the performance criteria in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4.
2.5. Instructor Evaluation. Instructor evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2.
   2.5.1. Initial Flight Evaluation. To initially qualify as an instructor in the F-16, the pilot must
   successfully complete an initial instructor evaluation. This is a one-time evaluation in which
   the examinee must demonstrate ability to instruct in some phase of the unit's mission. Except
   for requirements delineated under Area 33, Instructor Performance, in Chapter 3, specific
   profiles and/or events will be determined by the flight examiner.
   2.5.1. (AETC) Initial Flight Evaluation. To initially qualify as an instructor in the F-16, the
   WSO must successfully complete an initial instructor evaluation. This is a one-time
   evaluation in which the examinee must demonstrate ability to instruct in some phase of the
AFI11-2F-16V2_AETCSUP_I 18 MARCH 2013                                                           13


   unit's mission. Except for requirements in paragraph A3.2.33 (Added), specific profiles
   and/or events will be determined by the flight examiner.
   2.5.2. Subsequent aircrew evaluations (i.e. INSTM/QUAL and MSN) will include instructor
   portions during the evaluations.
   2.5.3. Chase Procedures. Formal Training Unit (FTU) Instructor Pilots (IPs) will be
   evaluated on chase procedures during INSTM/QUAL or MSN evaluations prior to
   performing FTU duties for the first time.
   2.5.3. (AETC) Chase Procedures. Not applicable to WSO QUAL evaluations.
   2.5.4. FTU and Weapons Instructor Course (WIC) Mission Evaluations. USAF Weapon
   School (USAFWS) and FTU Instructor Pilot mission evaluation profiles will normally be
   IAW the formal course syllabus for any MSN which the IP is qualified to instruct. The only
   required items for an FTU or WIC IP mission check are those items required by the syllabus,
   for the specific sortie being flown.
2.6. Instructor Pilot Rear Cockpit Landing Evaluations. An evaluation of rear cockpit
landings will be completed prior to performing rear cockpit landing instructor duties. These
duties include instruction for and demonstration of landings during initial qualification training,
requalification training, or additional training.
   2.6.1. Examinees will complete the evaluation as follows:
       2.6.1.1. All rear cockpit landing qualification evaluations will include satisfactory
       demonstration of overhead and emergency patterns, and a landing performed from the
       rear cockpit.
       2.6.1.2. IPs will accomplish the rear cockpit landing qualification during either the
       INSTM/QUAL evaluation sortie, the MSN evaluation sortie or during another sortie as a
       requisite. OGV will specify when the rear cockpit landing qualification will be completed
       and identify procedures for completion of this requirement in the unit supplement to AFI
       11-202V2.
   2.6.2. When the rear cockpit landing qualification is evaluated during a separate sortie as a
   requisite for a flight evaluation, record "SPOT" in the Flight Phase block on the AF Form 8.
   Describe the purpose of the evaluation as "Rear Cockpit Landing Qualification" in the
   Mission Description section of the Comments block. In addition, FEs will document all
   discrepancies on the AF Form 8 in Section IV, paragraph B, under a sub-paragraph after the
   EPE discrepancies as follows: "2. Rear Cockpit Landing Qualification." If no discrepancies
   are identified, enter "None" after the sub-paragraph title. A sub-paragraph 3 would then be
   used for flight discrepancies. If a reevaluation is required, an additional "SPOT" entry will be
   recorded in the Flight Phase block on the front of the AF Form 8. Additional training will be
   documented IAW AFI 11-202V2.
   2.6.3. An initial rear cockpit landing qualification may be conducted independently of
   another evaluation. FEs will document completion of this Rear Cockpit Landing
   Qualification as a "SPOT" evaluation on an AF Form 8. Evaluate RCP landing qualification
   on all subsequent INSTM/QUAL evaluations. It may be an additional sortie on the
   INSTM/QUAL evaluation, and documented as SPOT. If the entire INSTM/QUAL evaluation
   sortie is flown from the RCP and RCP landing requirements IAW AFI 11-2MDS-Vol2 are
 14                                        AFI11-2F-16V2_AETCSUP_I 18 MARCH 2013


   met, annotate the AF Form 8 with an INSTM/QUAL flight only, and add rear cockpit
   landing qualification in the mission description on the back of the AF Form 8.

     
1. Airwork/Advanced Handling/Tactical Maneuvering. This area is required for pilots receiving INSTM/QUAL
evaluations. Maneuvers can be:
     a. Aerobatics
     b. Advanced handling characteristics / Horn Awareness and Recovery Training Series / Confidence maneuvers
     c. Any Air-to-air mission (Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM), Air Combat Maneuvering, Air Combat Training, adversary
     training aid etc.)
     d. Any Air-to-Ground mission (CAS, AI, etc.)
     e. Formation (fingertip, tactical, trail)
2. Unusual Attitude Recoveries. Do not perform unusual attitude recoveries in single seat aircraft.
*3. Simulated Flame Out (SFO) Traffic Patterns/Approach/Landing. Pilots unable to accomplish an SFO during their
INSTM/QUAL evaluation may delay this emergency traffic pattern/approach requirement until their next periodic evaluation
(usually a MSN evaluation). When delayed until the next periodic evaluation, that evaluation will be incomplete until the
SFO is accomplished. Exception: Should adverse weather conditions impede accomplishment of an SFO, a simulator/UTD
evaluation may be used only after every attempt has been made to evaluate the SFO in the eligibility window of the
subsequent evaluation. To evaluate an SFO via simulator/UTD requires prior MAJCOM/A3T (AFRC – AFRC/A3V)
approval on a case-by-case basis. Pilots not requiring a MSN evaluation must accomplish an SFO during every
INSTM/QUAL evaluation and can also pursue MAJCOM/A3T (AFRC – AFRC/A3V) approval to evaluate it via
simulator/UTD on a case-by-case basis. For all cases, if an SFO is evaluated via simulator/UTD the subsequent INST/QUAL
evaluation must include in-flight evaluation of the SFO. Verbal evaluation of an SFO is never approved.
4. Precision Approach. At least one precision approach must be flown to complete the flight evaluation. Annotate types of
approach(es) flown in the mission description. (USAFE: aircrew will fly a PAR if available).
5. AETC. These items are not required on FTU Instructor evaluations when syllabus profiles make accomplishment
impractical (e.g. BFM mission checks). Document the omissions in the Comments portion of the AF Form 8.
6. Air-to-Ground Weapons Employment. Grade Hit/Miss IAW paragraph 3.4.3.2.
7. USAFWS. These items are not required on USAFWS Instructor evaluations when syllabus profiles make accomplishment
impractical. Document the omissions in the Comments portion of the AF Form 8.
8. ASA Units. ASA wings are waived and authorized to evaluate Air-to-Air Weapons Employment
(Area 77) during EPE profiles.

1. Areas annotated with an “R1” require evaluation of at least one of the items under the associated Section and category for
that evaluation. See paragraph 1.5.1. for detailed information.
2. Areas indicated with an “R2” require evaluation of at least two of the items under the associated Section for that
evaluation. See paragraph 1.5.1. for detailed information.
3. Air Defense qualified pilots in wings which support a full-time ASA detachment (or home-station alert) will complete at
least one Air Sovereignty intercept during every Mission EPE.

2.7. (Added-AETC) WSO Qualification Evaluation. This evaluation is normally combined
with WSO MSN. A separate QUAL evaluation may be administrated to basic aircraft
qualification WSOs who do not maintain qualification in the unit’s tactical mission and WSOs
going through initial qualification. This evaluation may be administered on any compatible
training mission with the approval of the unit Chief of Stan/Eval and the Squadron Commander’s
or Operations Officer's concurrence. Incorporate all required areas from Table A2.1 (Added).
Minimum ground phase requisites are:
   2.7.1. (Added-AETC) Closed and open book qualification examinations.
   2.7.2. (Added-AETC) EPE. See Table A2.2 (Added).
   2.7.3. (Added-AETC) Instrument examination.
2.8. (Added-AETC) WSO Mission Evaluation. Scenarios that represent unit Designed
Operational Capability (DOC) tasking satisfy evaluation requirements. Profiles will be designed
to evaluate the training/flight position/special qualifications as well as examinee’s basic
airmanship. Incorporate all required areas from Table A2.1 (Added). Initial mission evaluations
will be representative of the unit’s mission. Mission evaluations will normally be flown using
unit formations and tactics. Examinees will be evaluated in the position of their highest
qualification. If briefed, and at the FE’s discretion, portions may be flown in another position,

but the emphasis is to evaluate examinees at their highest qualification levels. Evaluations during
exercises or exercise deployments are encouraged. Evaluations during contingency/combat
deployments will be given as a last resort in order to maintain mission qualification status. Video
tape recorder (VTR) film may be used to evaluate the tactical portion of the sortie. Note:
Examinees will be evaluated only in those areas where they are qualified.
   2.8.1. (Added-AETC) Ground Phase Requisites. Minimum requirements are:
       2.8.1.1. (Added-AETC) EPE. See Table A2.2 (Added). Normally a single EPE fulfills
       the WSO QUAL/MSN evaluation EPE requirements.
       2.8.1.2. (Added-AETC) CAPs Written Exam. Answers must contain all critical
       action items in proper sequence. Abbreviations are allowed.
   2.8.2. (Added-AETC) Air-to-Air. This evaluation will include, as a minimum, one
   intercept, offensive maneuvering and planned weapons employment. Adversaries will
   simulate enemy aircraft, tactics and ordnance IAW AFTTP 3-1.Threat Guide. Dissimilar
   aircraft are preferred. Additionally, aircrew must have an operable radar. When weather or
   other restrictions prohibit ACBT, or low altitude training, aircrews may fly multiple
   intercepts.
   2.8.3. (Added-AETC) Air-to-Surface. First-look navigation and look-alike targets are
   encouraged. Navigation legs will reflect unit plans and tasking, with timing appropriate to the
   tasking. Mission profiles should include actual delivery of practice or live ordnance.
   Ordnance deliveries may be dry if, in the FE’s opinion, accomplishing an actual delivery
   would significantly decrease the realism of the sortie, the mission profile allows a thorough
   evaluation of the examinee, and the dry passes can be evaluated.

Notes:
1. Units will determine appropriate level of proficiency in these areas, based on WSO experience
levels. Examples include, but are not limited to aerobatics, confidence maneuvers, basic fighter
maneuvers (BFM), advanced handling characteristics, and formation (fingertip, tactical, trail).
2. Unusual attitude recoveries will be evaluated during EPEs, or in-flight with a pilot FE in the
aircraft.
3. Every attempt will be made to evaluate the full instrument penetration and approach. An en
route descent or radar vectors to final may be substituted if Air Traffic Control (ATC) constraints
prevent completion of the evaluation.
4. Either a precision approach radar (PAR) or an instrument landing system (ILS) recovery must
be performed if this area is evaluated.
5. These items are not required on FTU Instructor evaluations when syllabus profiles make
accomplishment impractical (e.g. BFM mission checks). Document the omissions in the
Comments portion of the AF Form 8.
6. Annotate by hit/miss per event.

     A3.2.2.2. (Added-AETC) Presentation:
        A3.2.2.2.1. (Added-AETC) Q. Presented briefing in a professional manner.
        Effective use of training aids. Flight members clearly understood mission
        requirements.
        A3.2.2.2.2. (Added-AETC) Q-. Did not make effective use of available training
        aids. Dwelled on non-essential mission items.
        A3.2.2.2.3. (Added-AETC) U. Did not use training aids. Redundant throughout
        briefing. Lost interest of flight members. Presentation created doubts or confusion.
     A3.2.2.3. (Added-AETC) Mission Coverage:
        A3.2.2.3.1. (Added-AETC) Q. Established objectives for the mission. Presented all
        training events and effective techniques discussed for accomplishing the mission.
        A3.2.2.3.2. (Added-AETC) Q-. Omitted some minor training events. Limited
        discussion of techniques.
        A3.2.2.3.3. (Added-AETC) U. Did not establish objectives for the mission.
        Omitted major training events or did not discuss techniques.

     A3.4.3.2. (Added-AETC) Area 82--Air-to-Ground Weapons Employment:
     Notes:
     1. Scoreable Ranges. When weapons deliveries are performed on different ranges during the
     same mission, or like deliveries constituting separate events are performed on the same range,
     all events will be evaluated and the area grade will be predicated upon the criteria in
     A3.4.3.2.1 (Added) through A3.4.3.2.3.3 (Added).

     2. Unscoreable Ranges. Hit/miss will be determined by the FE based on impact of the
     simulated ordnance and desired weapons effects for the pass flown.

     3. Simulated Releases. Hit/miss will be determined by the FE based on VTR film, etc.

     4. Unexplained Delivery Misses. The FE will determine hit/miss by reference to VTR film in
     cases where unexplained weapons delivery misses occur (e.g., wind shears).
