                                           Chapter 1

      USAF AIRSPACE PLANNING, MANAGEMENT, AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Management Objectives. The objective is to provide airspace in which USAF test and
training missions can be conducted as realistically as possible, while maximizing safety and
minimizing the impact on other users, surface activities, and the environment. Military users
should acquire only that airspace required for mission accomplishment and return airspace to the
National Airspace System (NAS) or host nation in a timely manner when not in use or when no
longer required. This ―Joint Use‖ policy ensures effective management of assigned airspace.
   1.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Airspace Use Philosophy.                 Headquarters (HQ) AFSOC is
   committed to the development and maintenance of required airspace necessary to safely
   accomplish 100 percent of present and future readiness training. AFSOC supports the
   effective and efficient use of all navigable airspace in the United States, including special use
   airspace (SUA) and airspace for special use (ASU). HQ AFSOC promotes real-time access
   to AFSOC-managed airspace by nonparticipating aircraft whenever it is not required for
   essential flight operations and training. HQ AFSOC/A3A will identify future SUA
   requirements to HQ Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as they become quantifiable.
   1.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) Exclusive Use. AFSOC units require "exclusive use" in AFSOC-
   managed airspace (see Attachment 1, Terms).
   1.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) Flight Operations/Training. Conduct flight operations/training
   only in appropriate SUA/ASU unless authorized by HQ AFSOC/A3. Agencies planning to
   use SUA/ASU must be familiar with special procedures/requirements detailed in letter of
   agreement (LOA) or letter of procedure (LOP).
1.2. Responsibilities and Command Relationships. The Airspace, Ranges, and Airfield
Operations Directorate (AF/A3O-A) is responsible for policy and oversight of civil aviation
collaboration, airspace, ranges, and airfield operations as designated by HQ USAF, Deputy Chief
of Staff, Air, Space & Information Operations, Plans & Requirements, through the Director of
Operations and Training. AF/A3O-A is the OPR for AFPD 13-2, Air Traffic Control, Airspace,
Airfield, and Range Management. The Ranges and Airspace Division, (AF/A3O-AR) is the focal
point for USAF airspace management. The USAF manages airspace through the major command
(MAJCOM) offices for airspace management, as well as the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) Headquarters (FAA/AJR-01) and FAA Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Service Area Air
Force Representatives (AFREPs). This instruction applies to each MAJCOM functioning as the
USAF component of a unified command as outlined in unified command directives and to the

sponsors regional and national ARC meetings to ensure that all USAF offices involved in
airspace and range operations have a common understanding of objectives and key issues. The
councils provide for a thorough review of airspace and range issues by interdisciplinary teams at
all management levels. The council meetings are open to all military services, land management
agencies, and other interested or concerned parties. The use, creation, modification, or transfer of
military airspace and ranges has the potential to become controversial. Because today‘s actions
are closely scrutinized by numerous Federal and State agencies, as well as, public and private
organizations and special interest groups, the USAF must be prepared to address concerns raised
at the local, regional, or national level during the development of any range or airspace action.
To better address these challenges and ensure continued access to test and training space, the
USAF has established review processes in the form of ARCs designed to:

  aligned to provide a geographic focus on airspace/range issues. They are open to delegates
  from all military services; land management agencies, and other interested or concerned
  parties with which the USAF should exchange constructive information concerning flight
  activities in the region. Council meetings may be hosted by military units, MAJCOMs,
  and/or Regional AFREPs, or other agencies as appropriate and approved by the regional co-
  chairs.
  1.3.3. Regional Council. The councils are co-chaired by one senior active duty officer and
  one senior NGB officer. Senior officers (O-6 and above) responsible for airspace and range
  management oversight at the unit, MAJCOM, and/or NGB State Headquarters level are
  preferred co-chairs. Co-chairs may be elected by the council, or appointed by AF/A3O-A or
  the NGB/CF. At the wing commander‘s discretion, units with minimal range or airspace
  management responsibility or requirements may elect not to participate in the councils.
  Commanders who exempt their units from council participation must notify the council chair
  through the AFREP. Since cross-communication and cooperation is the ultimate goal of the
  councils, agendas should include time for breakout meetings to allow those working specific
  issues time to gather. The council meetings typically include a DOD Session and a
  Management Session.
     1.3.3.1. DOD Session. The purpose of the DOD Session is to identify issues and
     shortfalls in test/training space or its attributes, present concepts to address shortfalls or
     meet new requirements, and to develop a consistent communications approach to clearly
     state proposed resolutions. Membership includes, as a minimum, the regional AFREP,
     representatives from the MAJCOM, Operations Group commanders or designees, and
     unit airspace managers. The regional co-chair shall be responsible for inviting other
     services present in the region to participate. Units should coordinate presentations on
     concepts for new or modified test/training space through their MAJCOM Airspace/Range
     Management Office.
         1.3.3.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Units planning to present a concept for new or modified
         test/training airspace at a regional council meeting must coordinate their presentation
         with HQ AFSOC/A3AA no later than (NLT) one week prior to the meeting date.
     1.3.3.2. Management Session. The Management Session is a forum for dialogue between
     DOD units and other agencies with either an aeronautical or an environmental stake in
     military flight operations. Representative non-DOD participants may include the FAA,
     National Park Service (NPS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Forest Service
     (USFS), Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), State
     Aviation Officials, and other bodies/groups focused on national aviation issues. Military
     units are requested to provide a short presentation (approximately five minutes) on their
     typical flight operations, training requirements, areas commonly overflown, and issues
     being worked to include current airspace. The Management Session also provides the
     opportunity for other agencies to address perspectives and present aeronautical or
     environmental issues. Since cross-communication and cooperation is the ultimate goal of
     the councils, agendas should include time for breakout meetings to allow those working
     specific issues time to gather.
         1.3.3.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) Airspace managers attending their respective regional
         management session will present a short briefing (approximately five minutes) on
AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                        15


         their typical flight operations, training requirements, areas commonly overflown and
         issues being worked to include current airspace. Units will coordinate this briefing
         with HQ AFSOC/A3AA NLT one week prior to the meeting.
         1.3.3.2.2. (Added-AFSOC) Unit airspace managers that are unable to attend their
         respective regional session meeting should ensure an alternate attends who is
         knowledgeable enough to advocate the position of their unit.
  1.3.4. Regional Executive Session. The purpose of the Executive Session is to provide
  senior-level oversight of the regional airspace/range process and issues identified at the
  council meeting. The Executive Session should present a strategic direction to plan and
  promote development of aerospace test and training resources to support present and future
  military needs in the regions. Participants should formulate a strategic course of action that
  will focus long-term regional goals and national security objectives resulting in
  programmatic guidance leading to the resolution of range and airspace issues. The goal is to
  preserve a highly capable force structure within the region, supported by efficient and
  effective training infrastructures.
     1.3.4.1. In addition to the co-chairs, attendance is limited to MAJCOM representatives,
     AFREPs and other military representatives (MILREPs), and senior NGB representatives
     from each state in the region. The strategic interests of individual units will be
     represented by their MAJCOM and/or their NGB state representative. If units have
     specific issues that require the attention of the Executive Session, they should attend at
     the discretion of the MAJCOM and only with the concurrence of a co-chair. Unless
     specifically authorized by the co-chairs, attendance by non-DOD representatives is
     inappropriate. Non-DOD participants may be invited at the discretion of the co-chairs to
     address specific issues. Co-chairs are responsible to invite other equivalent level
     representatives from other military departments.
  1.3.5. National Airspace/Range Executive Council (NAREC). The NAREC will convene to
  allow senior USAF leaders to review pending and proposed range and airspace actions from
  a national perspective and provide feedback to regional councils, MAJCOM, and HQ USAF.
  The NAREC meeting will also serve as a forum for senior USAF leaders to focus on a
  national strategic vision for ranges/airspace and keep members informed of national-level
  events and trends affecting airspace and range actions. NAREC membership includes as a
  minimum, the chair of each regional council and the senior officers charged with airspace
  and range responsibilities from the MAJCOM and Air Staff. The NAREC is co-chaired by
  AF/A3O and an equivalent NGB general officer. All AFREPs and MAJCOM airspace and
  range managers and Range/Airspace Division Chiefs should attend this meeting. Senior
  representatives from other government agencies and services may be invited by the regional
  co-chair and should be approved by the national co-chairs as required.
  1.3.6. NAREC/Regional Meeting Outlines. Meetings should be arranged to address on-going
  issues, assign OPR/OCRs, and track action progress. MAJCOM, state, and/or unit
  representatives can also brief pertinent issues to the Council.
  1.3.7. Unit/MAJCOM/Airspace and Range Councils—General. The ARCs provide a forum
  for designing, updating, and tracking proposed airspace and range actions in support of unit
  flying missions. Units and MAJCOMs may conduct their own ARCs to address specific
  airspace and range needs.

  1.3.7. (AFSOC) ARC memberships at the unit level will consist of, as a minimum,
  representatives from operations, environmental, legal and public affairs. A senior officer,
  normally Operations Group commander or equivalent, will chair the ARC.
  1.3.8. NAREC/Regional Airspace and Range Council Minutes. All minutes from the
  NAREC and regional ARCs will be forwarded to the MAJCOM POCs for Airspace and
  Range Management. All MAJCOM Airspace and Range Management offices will forward
  applicable regional ARC minutes to units within that region.

                                            Chapter 2

                        AIRSPACE FOR MILITARY OPERATIONS

2.1. Special Use Airspace (SUA). SUA is a designation for airspace that is of a defined vertical
and lateral dimension that alerts users to areas of unusual flight hazards and separates those
activities from other airspace users to enhance safety. Certain limitations or restrictions may be
placed on non-participating aircraft. Except for controlled firing areas (CFA), SUA is depicted
on aeronautical charts. Additional information on SUA may be found in the following: Title 14
Code of Federal Regulations, Part 73, Special Use Airspace, current edition; FAAO 7400.2,
FAAO 7400.8, Special Use Airspace; and Flight Information Publications (FLIP): General
Planning (Chapter 2), AP/1A, AP/2A, and AP/3A. SUA includes Controlled Firing Areas
(CFA), Military Operations Areas (MOA), Restricted Areas, Warning Areas, Alert Areas,
Prohibited Areas, and National Security Areas (NSA) (CONUS, Alaska, and Hawaii only).
   2.1.1. Controlled Firing Area (CFA). CFAs contain civilian and military activities that could
   be hazardous to non-participating aircraft. These include rocket testing, ordnance disposal,
   and small arms fire. CFAs are differentiated from MOAs and restricted areas in that the
   hazardous activities are suspended to avoid a potential hazard to non-participating aircraft.
   Radar or a ground lookout is utilized to indicate when an aircraft might be approaching the
   area, and activities are then suspended. CFAs are not depicted on aeronautical charts.
   2.1.2. Military Operations Area (MOA). Airspace designated for nonhazardous military
   activity, established outside Class A airspace, below 18,000 feet mean sea level (MSL), and
   within US territorial airspace. Activities conducted in MOAs include, but are not limited to,
   aerobatics, air combat tactics, and formation training. This airspace serves to segregate non-
   participating Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) aircraft from the activity and inform non-
   participating Visual Flight Rules (VFR) aircraft where these activities are being conducted.
   VFR aircraft are not restricted from transiting MOAs.
   2.1.3. Restricted Area. Designated areas established by appropriate authority where aircraft
   flight, while not wholly prohibited, is subject to restriction. They are shown on aeronautical
   charts and published in Notices to Airmen (NOTAM). Restricted Areas are designated
   rulemaking airspace under 14 CFR Part 73, where restrictions are placed on all non-
   participating aircraft. This airspace is used to contain military activities that are hazardous to
   non-participating aircraft, and lies within the territorial airspace of the United States. The
   term "hazardous" implies, but is not limited to, live firing of weapons and/or aircraft testing.
   2.1.4. Warning Area. Airspace of defined dimensions extending from 3 or 12 nautical miles
   (NM) outward from the coast of the United States containing activity that may be hazardous
   to non-participating aircraft. The purpose of warning areas is to warn non-participating pilots
   of the potential danger. Warning Areas may be located over domestic waters, international
   waters, or both. They are equivalent to ICAO "danger areas" and are exclusively located over
   the coastal waters of the US and its territories. Activity may be hazardous, but international
   agreements do not provide for prohibition of flight in international airspace so no restriction
   to flight exists. DOD Directive 4540.1, Use of Airspace by US Military Aircraft and Firings
   Over the High Seas, 13 January 1981, applies to activities conducted in this airspace.
   Executive Order 10854, Extension of the application of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958,
18                                           AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


  establishes the relationship between the DOD, State Department, and FAA regarding
  warning areas and military operations within international airspace under the purview of
  FAA air traffic services. Presidential Proclamation No. 5928, Territorial sea of the United
  States of America, 27 December 1988, codified in Title 3, Code of Federal Regulations,
  extended the US territorial boundary limit from 3 to 12 NM.
  2.1.5. Alert Area. Airspace designated to inform pilots of a high level of training activity or
  any unusual activity where prior knowledge would significantly enhance air safety. Examples
  of alert areas include very busy airports or areas of high-density oil-rig helicopter traffic.
  Activity conducted in this airspace is in accordance with FARs (unless waived or exempted).
  There are no restrictions placed on non-participating IFR or VFR aircraft.
  2.1.6. Prohibited Area. Prohibited areas prohibit overflight of a surface area in the interest of
  national security or environmental protection. Aircraft are prohibited from flying within a
  prohibited area without permission of the using agency. There are no prohibited areas
  managed by the DOD. Examples of prohibited areas include the White House, the National
  Mall, and Camp David. Prohibited areas are depicted in most publication with a ―P‖ followed
  by a numeric identifier, e.g., P56.
  2.1.7. National Security Area (NSA). An NSA is designated where there is a requirement for
  increased security and safety of ground facilities. When it is necessary to provide a greater
  level of security and safety, flight in NSAs may be temporarily prohibited by regulation
  under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 99.7, Special Security
  Instructions, current edition.
     2.1.7.1. Per FAAO 7400.2, an NSA is designated to enhance national security and
     protect national assets. An NSA is identified on sectional aeronautical charts to inform
     users of the NAS regarding the NSA‘s vertical and lateral dimensions, but is not an
     exclusionary airspace that can be used to prevent aircraft from entering that airspace.
     FAAO 7400.2 states, ―pilots are requested to voluntarily avoid flying through an NSA.‖
     Hence, charted NSAs are advisory in nature only. An NSA is not a vehicle to preclude
     aircraft from entering the designated airspace, or to protect any asset or operation within
     or beneath the NSA. Caution: Units/installations should balance the advantage of charting
     an NSA to the disadvantage of highlighting a national asset to the general public.
     2.1.7.2. If it is determined that security measures within an established NSA require the
     temporary restriction of flight activity, a temporary flight restriction (TFR) would need to
     be coordinated with the FAA to restrict flight within that volume of airspace charted as
     an NSA. In addition to requesting a TFR through FAA channels IAW 14 CFR Part 99.7,
     and FAAO 7210.3, Facility Operation and Administration, units/installations shall
     coordinate through their respective MAJCOM airspace management offices and
     AF/A3O-AR.
     2.1.7.3. If a unit determines that an NSA is required as a candidate measure to achieve
     required increased protective measures for the installation or owned facility, the unit
     should address the requirement through the base/installation anti-terrorism/force
     protection working group. As a normal practice of identifying installation security risks
     and protective measures, use the criteria established in FAAO 7400.2 to determine the
     dimensions of the required airspace. The dimensions should be limited to the minimum
     required to promote the protection of the national asset or area identified (e.g., identify
AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                          19


       the area of interest vice the entire base property). For processing actions for an NSA, see
       para 3.4.
   2.1.8. Joint Use. Under the ‗joint-use‘ concept, SUA is released to the controlling agency
   and becomes available for access by non-participating aircraft during periods when the
   airspace is not needed by the using agency for its designated purpose. Such use enhances
   safety and benefits the NAS. The USAF encourages the use of military radar units and the
   provisions of military air traffic services for SUA complexes when such services are
   available to enhance safety and utility.
NOTE:
 The sole responsibility to remain within assigned SUA rests with the pilot, whether flying under
IFR or VFR.
2.2. Airspace for Special Use (ASU) Designations. These designations are in either FAAO
7610.4 or in military regulations and documents. ASU designations are not rulemaking actions
and some (contained solely in military documents) may not require coordination with the FAA
for establishment. ASU is used to collectively identify non-SUA assets. ASU is airspace of
defined dimensions wherein activities must be confined because of their nature and where
limitations may be imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities. ASU
includes Aerial Refueling (AR) Tracks/Anchors, Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace
(ATCAA), Low Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) areas, TFR, Cruise Missile Routes, Local
Flying Area, Military Training Routes (Instrument Routes [IR]/Visual Routes [VR], and Slow
Routes [SR]).
   2.2.1. Aerial Refueling (AR) Airspace. Airspace developed according to the provisions of
   FAAO 7610.4 to conduct air refueling. Permanent air refueling airspace is designated as
   either a track or an anchor or established via a letter of agreement (LOA) with the appropriate
   ATC facility responsible for the airspace. After coordination with ATC, refueling routes or
   anchors are processed through the appropriate AFREP for publication in FLIP. Temporary or
   special AR airspace may also be established by coordination/agreement with the ATC facility
   having purview over the airspace.
   2.2.2. Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA). Defined airspace normally within
   Class A airspace (above 18,000 feet MSL) and established in accordance with FAAO 7610.4
   by an LOA with the ATC facility having responsibility for the airspace. ATCAAs were
   established to permit the continuation of MOA activities above 18,000 feet MSL. They can
   be combined with an MOA or established as a stand-alone piece of airspace. MOAs are
   depicted on aeronautical charts, but ATCAAs are not. Non-participating aircraft are
   separated from the military activity being conducted within the ATCAA by ATC. VFR
   aircraft are permitted to enter an MOA, but are not permitted to enter most ATCAAs because
   they are not permitted to fly VFR above 18,000 feet MSL.
   2.2.3. Low-Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) Areas. Usually large geographic areas
   established for random VFR, low altitude navigation training to preclude flying over the
   same point more than once per day. Activities are in accordance with all applicable FARs
   and flown at an airspeed of 250 knots or less. MAJCOMs will determine establishment
   criteria. There is no required coordination with the FAA. LATN areas are not published on
   aeronautical charts. Environmental documentation in accordance with AFI 32-7061 is
20                                          AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


  required. Send copies of LATN areas to the appropriate AFREP. A full description of the
  LATN area(s) and any restrictions will be maintained in the unit flight operations office.
     2.2.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) Low altitude tactical navigation (LATN) areas shall normally
     be established at or below 1500 feet above ground level (AGL).
     2.2.3.2. (Added-AFSOC) Compliance with all applicable CFRs is mandatory.                The
     avoidance of persons, structures, and obstructions is paramount.
     2.2.3.3. (Added-AFSOC) A T/TSNS will be initiated for each new LATN area to be
     developed. Forward the T/TSNS and a map of the proposed LATN area to HQ
     AFSOC/A3AA for evaluation and review. HQ AFSOC/A3AA will provide assistance as
     required in the development of the LATN area. SOW/CC is the approval authority for
     the LATN once coordination is accomplished.
     2.2.3.4. (Added-AFSOC) Environmental        Impact    Analysis   Process    (EIAP)
     documentation will be in accordance with Title 32, CFR, Part 989. Environmental
     documentation shall be retained on file by the proponent and updated as required to
     reflect current operations.
     2.2.3.5. (Added-AFSOC) Documentation establishing LATN areas shall be kept on file
     by the proponent in accordance with USAF RDS, Table 13. A copy of the approved
     documentation and area chart will be provided to HQ AFSOC/A3AA.
  2.2.4. Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR). A TFR can be established to protect people or
  property from a temporary hazard when the presence of low-flying aircraft would magnify,
  alter, spread, or compound the hazard. TFRs provide a safe environment for the operation of
  disaster relief aircraft and prevent unsafe congestion of sightseeing aircraft above an incident
  or event that may generate a high degree of interest. TFRs are commonly used to increase the
  safety of aircraft performing aerial firefighting operations. This information is available via
  NOTAM and the implementing NOTAM will contain specific information to preclude
  misunderstanding.
  2.2.5. Cruise Missile Routes. Cruise missile operations conducted in excess of 250 knots and
  below 10,000 feet MSL are conducted in restricted areas, MOAs, and along selected IRs
  during daylight hours under VFR conditions. Cruise missiles will be accompanied by two
  escort aircraft that have the ability to maneuver the missile out of the flight path of
  conflicting traffic at all times.
  2.2.6. Local Flying Areas. Most military facilities develop local flying areas within which
  they can conduct routine, non-hazardous training activity. These areas are normally
  developed in conjunction with local FAA controllers and airspace managers and are de-
  conflicted with other airspace such as Class B, C, or D airspace, SUA, or ASU.
  2.2.7. Military Training Routes (MTR). The MTR program is established by the FAA and
  the DOD for the purpose of conducting low-altitude, high-speed training. Generally, MTRs
  are established below 10,000 feet MSL for operations at speeds in excess of 250 knots. Each
  segment of an MTR route is allocated a floor and ceiling altitude and lateral boundaries,
  described in NM left and right of centerline. MTRs are established according to the criteria in
  FAAO 7610.4. Routes are established as either IR or VR. The DOD has a speed exemption
  to 14 CFR Part 91.117 (see FAAO 7610.4). The FAA has approval authority over IR
AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                        21


  establishment and the appropriate MAJCOM approves establishment of VRs. Environmental
  documentation in accordance with AFI 32-7061 is required to establish MTRs. VRs are
  processed through the FAA via the AFREP. AFREPs assign all route numbers. Ultimately,
  MTRs are published in FLIP AP/1B and charted on FLIP AP/1B Area Planning Chart, and
  FAA sectional charts. Some MTRs are on DOD Low IFR enroute charts.
     2.2.7.1. MTR Evaluations. MTR evaluations include route reviews that have a
     management focus and annual flight evaluations that have an operational focus. Units
     with scheduling authority for an MTR will conduct and document evaluations for all
     MTRs with a floor at or below 1,500 feet Above Ground Level (AGL) by the last day of
     the anniversary month. Failure to complete them in the prescribed time limits necessitates
     closing the route/segment, unless waived by the MAJCOM (or NAF where the
     MAJCOM has delegated this responsibility to the NAF). All MTRs shall be surveyed
     across their entire route width and length and aircrew route briefing guides updated to
     reflect new areas of concern. The SUA/MTR Review, Attachment 4, contains additional
     information required when reviewing MTR.
        2.2.7.1.1. Route Review. Route reviews should be conducted by the unit airspace
        manager using the Chart Updating Manual (CHUM), FLIP AP/1B, Sectional
        Aeronautical Charts, Tactical Pilotage Charts, and other aeronautical charts. Route
        reviews should annotate the following:
            2.2.7.1.1.1. Charted/uncharted obstacles or hazards within 100 feet of the MTR
            floor and 2 NM of the lateral boundary.
            2.2.7.1.1.2. Entry/exit/route segment within 5 NM of public-use airports.
            2.2.7.1.1.3. Entry/exit/route segment within 5 NM of Class B, C, and D airspace.
            Also consider Class E airspace associated with non-towered airports and
            instrument approach procedures.
            2.2.7.1.1.4. Entry/exit/route segment within 5 NM of airways and charted VFR
            flyways.
            2.2.7.1.1.5. Potential bird attractant areas within 2 NM of a route that may attract
            large concentrations of birds.
            2.2.7.1.1.6. Potential noise-sensitive areas within 3 NM of a route. Review areas
            where restrictions are identified to minimize the impact of noise.
            2.2.7.1.1.7. TFRs established by FAA NOTAMs (i.e., wild fires, DOI
            environmentally sensitive animal breeding areas, and parachute jumping areas).
            2.2.7.1.1.8. Other potential flight safety hazards.
            2.2.7.1.1.9. Route reviews should also verify the accuracy of aircrew route
            briefings and ensure MTR Special Operating Procedures and Remarks published
            in FLIP AP/1B are accurate and complete. Review previous route evaluations to
            ensure any other previously identified findings have been appropriately addressed.
            2.2.7.1.1.10. Unit Civil Engineering environmental office shall review the route
            for environmentally sensitive areas.
 22                                         AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


          2.2.7.1.2. Route Evaluation. Route evaluations are intended as ongoing operational
          checks as to how a specific route is mission planned, entered, flown, and exited
          during day-to-day operations. Route evaluations are used to document uncharted or
          undocumented obstacles, environmentally sensitive areas, and other potential flight
          safety hazards, to include planning deficiencies and potential flight conflicts with
          other routes, Class B, C, and D airspace, and air traffic service procedures. Data
          gathered during route evaluations are to be used to recommend changes to USAF
          policy and procedures and to update in-flight guides, FLIP, and other pertinent
          publications. Airspace managers should work with route schedulers and users to
          develop local evaluation methods to facilitate effective route evaluation by users and
          document follow-up and corrective action taken to alleviate flight safety hazards
          identified during evaluations.
NOTE:
 There is no required frequency for route evaluations. They should be accomplished by aircrew
on an as needed basis based on actual operations where problems were encountered.
          2.2.7.1.3. MTR Annual Flight Evaluation. The annual flight evaluation complements
          the ongoing route evaluation program by continuing the operational check of the
          route. The annual flight evaluation provides important data, as it is not completed
          under the same mission conditions (e.g., aircraft type, speed, required systems checks,
          etc.) and ensures a comprehensive operational review of the MTR. Conduct the
          evaluation during the anniversary month after publication or within a year since the
          last flight evaluation (MTR segments with a floor of 1,500 feet AGL or higher need
          not be evaluated).
              2.2.7.1.3.1. Failure to meet the annual suspense shall preclude the use of MTRs
              until evaluation requirements are met, unless waived by the MAJCOM.
              2.2.7.1.3.1. (AFSOC) Failure to complete the evaluation in the prescribed time
              limits necessitates closing the route unless waived by HQ AFSOC/A3. Units will
              document and maintain route evaluations.
              2.2.7.1.3.2. Evaluations should be conducted at low airspeeds to allow more time
              for observation. Evaluation aircraft should be either conventional aircraft capable
              of low airspeeds or helicopters. Use of Civil Air Patrol, aero club, or
              contract/charter is encouraged. Should such aircraft be unobtainable, the
              evaluation should be conducted at the slowest operational airspeed consistent with
              the type of aircraft normally flying the route.
              2.2.7.1.3.3. The route should be evaluated to ensure obstruction clearance at the
              minimum altitude usable for training. The evaluation aircrew should consider the
              route‘s minimum defined altitude when considering an obstacle‘s flight safety
              potential, as other units may train at lower altitudes. If possible, the airspace
              manager should act as a pilot or as an observer on as many evaluation flights as
              possible.
              2.2.7.1.3.4. Flight evaluation crew members should be familiar with low-altitude
              flying and evaluation requirements. They should receive a pre-brief from the
              scheduling activity and provide a de-briefing to the scheduling activity.
AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                            23


               2.2.7.1.3.5. The scheduling activity, in coordination with the airspace manager,
               must develop an MTR survey schedule. The airspace manager must ensure the
               necessary charts are available for the evaluation and inform the Obstruction
               Evaluation/Airport Airspace Analysis (OE/AAA) Program Manager of uncharted
               obstructions within 100 feet below the floor and within 2 NM of the lateral
               boundary of the MTR or any other hazards to air traffic affecting low-altitude
               navigation.
               2.2.7.1.3.6. Routes less than 4 NM wide may require two passes; one each side of
               the centerline. Routes greater than 4 NM wide may require additional passes to
               complete an adequate evaluation. Route centerlines are established for charting
               and route width measuring purposes only and may not require a direct pass.
               2.2.7.1.3.7. All users must be alert for new obstructions/hazards. Aircrews should
               be briefed to report any observed construction (i.e., temporary cranes, mines,
               temporary helipads, etc.) or uncharted obstructions/hazards to the scheduling
               activity/airspace manager. Information should include latitude and longitude
               coordinates and estimated height and description of obstructions/hazards.
NOTE:
 Professional judgment is the key to effective evaluations. Visual acuity may vary greatly and the
parameters above are given as guidelines only. Evaluation aircrew must consider the impact of
foliage, haze, clouds, fog contrast (light), airspeed/ground speed, terrain, snow, and task
saturation.
               2.2.7.1.3.8. The evaluation aircrew should consider the following when
               conducting evaluations:
NOTE:
 Document a potential hazard‘s latitude and longitude for identification purposes. Provide an
estimated or actual height of the obstruction if possible.
                  2.2.7.1.3.8.1. Accuracy, adequacy, and availability of mission planning
                  materials for the route.
                  2.2.7.1.3.8.2. Accuracy and completeness of the aircrew route briefing.
                  2.2.7.1.3.8.3. Potential hazards during entry and exit procedures, to include
                  possible ATC conflicts, ATC center/sector boundaries, possible
                  communication problems, frequency congestion, and task saturation.
                  2.2.7.1.3.8.4. Identify obstacles not listed in the CHUM that pose a hazard.
                  2.2.7.1.3.8.5. Possible ATC conflicts from public-use airports to include
                  portions of the route within 5 NM of Class B, C, and D airspace. Also
                  consider Class E airspace associated with non-towered airports and instrument
                  approach procedures.
                  2.2.7.1.3.8.6. Possible ATC conflicts from airways, charted VFR flyways or
                  practice areas, and other MTRs.
                  2.2.7.1.3.8.7. Potential for bird strikes from bird attractant areas to include
                  known migratory routes.
24                                         AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


               2.2.7.1.3.8.8. Built-up areas showing new development (buildings) including
               evidence of mining activity.
               2.2.7.1.3.8.9. Environmentally sensitive areas not previously identified.
               2.2.7.1.3.8.10. Possible interference to night vision goggle operations.
               2.2.7.1.3.8.11. Other potential flight safety hazards.
            2.2.7.1.3.9. The evaluation aircrew should return the survey documentation to the
            scheduling activity/airspace manager. Aircrews should also debrief the scheduling
            activity on specific observations and their potential to create conflicts and/or task
            saturation with flight operations.
        2.2.7.1.4. (Added-AFSOC) Wing-level Chief of Airspace Management (CAM) and
        environmental personnel flight (EPF) shall conduct an EIAP review of each
        MTR/LATN at least every five years from the anniversary date, or date of last review.
        At a minimum EIAP reviews should address the following:
            2.2.7.1.4.1. (Added-AFSOC) Changes in operations.
            2.2.7.1.4.2. (Added-AFSOC) Weapon systems.
            2.2.7.1.4.3. (Added-AFSOC) Environmentally sensitive and built-up areas (as
            they relate to previously documented environmental impacts).
            2.2.7.1.4.4. (Added-AFSOC) Changes in emissions.
            2.2.7.1.4.5. (Added-AFSOC) Altitude changes.
            2.2.7.1.4.6. (Added-AFSOC) Frequency of operations.
            2.2.7.1.4.7. (Added-AFSOC) Munitions (including chaff and flare).
            2.2.7.1.4.8. (Added-AFSOC) Aircraft noise.
     2.2.7.2. Evaluation Results. Airspace managers must coordinate with schedulers and the
     senior operational commander on any route, or a segment of a route, found to contain
     potential flight safety hazards. An assessment of the hazard must be conducted prior to
     closing or reopening the route or route segment. Ensure corrective actions are
     documented.
        2.2.7.2.1. Report uncharted obstacles on MTRs to the scheduling activity/airspace
        manager as soon as possible after landing. Airspace managers shall update uncharted
        obstacles, within 100 feet of the floor and within 2 NM of the lateral boundary of the
        MTR for inclusion in the Special Operating Procedures in FLIP AP/1B of the
        evaluated route.
            2.2.7.2.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Use FAA Form 7110-4 to identify uncharted
            obstacles for inclusion in the Special Operating Procedures.
            2.2.7.2.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) Uncharted obstructions above 200 feet AGL
            should be reported to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)
            through HQ AFSOC/A3AA.
AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                         25


         2.2.7.2.2. Units shall remove all references to charted obstacles from the route
         Special Operating Procedures in FLIP AP/1B. Include uncharted obstacles in the
         aircrew route briefing guides.
     2.2.7.3. Aircrew Route Briefing Guides. Units shall prepare and maintain aircrew route
     briefing guides for each MTR for which they are the scheduling activity. Briefing guides
     will include special operating procedures and constraints and may emphasize items
     already mentioned in FLIP AP/1B.
         2.2.7.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) Route briefing guides define route deconfliction
         procedures, special operating procedures and/or constraints that are not covered in the
         FLIP AP/1B.
         2.2.7.3.2. (Added-AFSOC) An MTR will be used only for those activities for which
         it was designed and environmentally assessed.
     2.2.7.4. FLIP AP/1B, Special Operating Procedures/Remarks. FLIP AP/1B provides
     information and operating instructions for all MTRs. Therefore, it is critical that units
     ensure information listed in FLIP AP/1B is complete and accurate. Originating and
     scheduling activities must ensure FLIP AP/1B identifies those procedures for the safe and
     efficient operation of aircraft on their respective MTRs. At a minimum, units shall
     include the following in Special Operating Procedures or Remarks:
         2.2.7.4.1. Potential hazards during entry, exit and flying of the route. Include listing
         all Class B, C, and D airspace within 5 NM of the route. Include reference to the
         applicable Sectional Aeronautical Chart.
         2.2.7.4.2. Unpublished/uncharted obstruction data pending publishing/charting.
         2.2.7.4.3. Route deconfliction procedures.
         2.2.7.4.4. Possible bird attractant areas and migratory routes.
         2.2.7.4.5. Noise and low-level flight sensitive areas.
         2.2.7.4.6. Uncharted airports.
         2.2.7.4.7. Other potential flight safety hazards.
  2.2.8. Slow Speed Low Altitude Training Routes (SR). SRs are low-level training routes
  used for military air operations conducted at or below 1,500 feet AGL and at an airspeed of
  250 knots or less. Unlike IR and VR MTRs, SRs are not technically part of the MTR system
  and therefore have no directive guidance in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) or
  FAAO 7610.4. MAJCOMs will determine establishment criteria. There is no requirement for
  coordination with the FAA. SRs are published in FLIP AP/1B; however, they are not
  published on aeronautical charts. Environmental documentation in accordance with AFI 32-
  7061 is required. There is no overall mechanism to inform military or civilian aviators that an
  SR is active, as Automated Flight Services Stations are not notified. A full description of the
  SRs and any restrictions will be maintained in the unit flight operations office.
     2.2.8.1. (Added-AFSOC) Altitudes and Corridors. Slow Routes (SR) shall be
     established at or below 1500 feet AGL. SR widths will be of sufficient size to encompass
     all planned activities required for the aircraft training profile. Under no circumstances
     should the route be wider than 20 nautical miles (NM).
 26                                       AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


       2.2.8.2. (Added-AFSOC) Compliance with all applicable CFRs is mandatory.         The
       avoidance of persons, structures and obstructions is paramount.
       2.2.8.3. (Added-AFSOC) EIAP documentation will be in accordance with Title 32,
       CFR, Part 989. Environmental documentation shall be retained on file by the proponent
       and updated as required to reflect current operations.
       2.2.8.4. (Added-AFSOC) Documentation establishing SR will be accomplished using a
       FAA Form 7110-4. Maintain all documents in accordance with USAF RDS Table 13,
       Rule-4.
2.3. (Added-AFSOC) Scheduling SUA/ASU. SUA/ASU is a DOD resource. Although
AFSOC-managed/scheduled SUA/ASU is established to support AFSOC requirements,
scheduling agencies of AFSOC SUA/ASU will support the requirements of other DOD airspace
users. AFSOC-managed SUA/ASU will be scheduled on an exclusive-use basis. AFSOC units
using SUA/ASU scheduled by other DOD agencies may operate on a mutual/concurrent-use
basis consistent with the host unit‘s policy.
2.4. (Added-AFSOC) Exercise Airspace. The coordination and or development of airspace to
support special events such as Field Training Exercises, Operational Readiness Inspections,
Evaluations or Joint Chiefs of Staff Exercises may require the involvement of the unit, NAF,
DRU and/or MAJCOM airspace managers as trusted agents.
   2.4.1. (Added-AFSOC) Develop temporary or modify existing airspace for exercises IAW
   FAAO JO 7610.4 and/or 7400.2. Use of exercise airspace may require environmental
   assessment. Conduct exercise planning with sufficient lead time to meet FAA timelines to
   secure airspace approval and notification.

                                           Chapter 3

                    PROCESSING AIRSPACE AND RANGE ACTIONS

3.1. Test/Training Space Needs Statement (T/TSNS). T/TSNS is defined as air, land, or sea
that is used to conduct test/training activities. In a T/TSNS, proponents describe the operational
requirement, concept, alternatives, and an analysis of competing stakeholders in a brief
document. The T/TSNS should be completed prior to initiating the USAF EIAP and once
validated, can serve as the starting point for developing the Description of Proposed Action and
Alternatives (DOPAA). Actions to establish or modify test/training space (including ranges,
ATCAAs, MOAs, MTRs, Restricted Areas, Warning Areas, or permanent airspace), except those
purely administrative in nature, will be reviewed by the unit, MAJCOM, and AF/A3O-AR.
Coordination should include MAJCOM Civil Engineer (office responsible for Environment
Analysis), Legal, and PA offices. Modification to test/training space that does not alter the
dimensions, altitudes, times of designation (such as changing the designation of the controlling
or using agency or correction of typographical errors in the published description), or LOA
changes, will be reviewed by the unit and MAJCOM and do not require a T/TSNS.
   3.1.1. Airspace actions in this preliminary stage should be referred to as ―concepts‖, since
   there is no assurance that outlined solution will move forward to be developed into a formal
   action that would require an aeronautical/environmental proposal developed in cooperation
   with the FAA. During informal liaison with stakeholders, it is important to keep in mind the
   use of the flexible and less formalized status of a ―concept‖ rather than a more developed and
   stringent action required in a proposal status.
   3.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) Processing Airspace Proposals. Prior to beginning an airspace
   proposal, unit airspace managers should ensure TERPS requirements, impacts or
   considerations are addressed.
       3.1.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) Develop airspace proposals IAW FAAO JO 7610.4 and/or
       FAAO JO 7400.2. Use the current sectional chart, or full size printed facsimile of the
       current sectional chart, to depict the airspace proposal. Submit the proposal through the
       chain of command to HQ AFSOC/A3AA.
   3.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) The airspace management proponent must keep a copy of
   completed airspace action (to include the applicable final environmental documentation) for
   historical records. See USAF RDS, Table 13-4.
   3.1.4. (Added-AFSOC) , Development of SUA/ASU. Prior to initiating a new airspace
   proposal, examine the suitability of existing SUA/ASU, the capacity of the airspace being
   examined to accommodate projected requirements, and coordinate with local Air Traffic
   Control (ATC) agencies. Process changes in the same manner as new proposals.
3.2. T/TSNS Procedures. Development of the T/TSNS will vary depending upon the level of
initiation and scope of the need. Units may initiate their own T/TSNS for perceived needs, or by
direction from their MAJCOMs for a unit mission change. For example, an F-16 unit may be
directed to change their mission from air defense to general purpose, or a fighter unit may be
equipped with a new missile with capabilities and tactics that dictate different training space
characteristics. At a higher level, a MAJCOM may have the need to initiate a significant change
in training for a completely new weapon system. New and ongoing T/TSNSs will also be
 28                                         AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


addressed at the applicable ARC, for the purpose of providing a regional perspective to ongoing
initiatives. Unit or MAJCOM procedures apply as follows:
3.2. (AFSOC)T/TSNS Procedures. Airspace managers will brief unit-level T/TSNS concepts
to the applicable regional Airspace and Range Council as early in the process as possible. The
MAJCOM airspace manager will facilitate scheduling the briefing at the next applicable regional
meeting.
   3.2.1. Unit T/TSNS. For unit proponents, the T/TSNS is initially coordinated through the
   unit and approved by the wing commander (or equivalent). The T/TSNS is then forwarded to
   the MAJCOM for review, comment, and/or concurrence, as appropriate.
       3.2.1.1. MAJCOM and Air Staff Review. If the MAJCOM concurs with an initiative
       (this includes the NGB and AFRC), the MAJCOM will forward the T/TSNS to AF/A3O-
       AR, for Air Staff review and comment. The Air Staff (AF/A3O-AR, SAF/IEI, SAF/IEE,
       AF/A7CPB, SAF/GCN, AF/A3O-AD [AFREP], and other offices deemed appropriate)
       review shall be completed within 30 working days of AF/A3O-AR receipt. AFREPs will
       ensure that the T/TSNS is coordinated with other Service Area MILREPs to determine
       any impact to USAF or other service airspace actions. If the 30-day suspense cannot be
       met, AF/A3O-AR will notify the MAJCOM. The Air Staff will identify issues during this
       initial review prior to further MAJCOM processing and approval.
       3.2.1.1. (AFSOC) HQ AFSOC/A3A will retain a copy of coordination documentation
       for all T/TSNS‘s submitted for review. Documentation must indicate approval from the
       wing commander and will include coordination with AFSOC Civil Engineer (office
       responsible for the environmental analysis), Legal and Public Affairs (PA) offices.
   3.2.2. MAJCOM T/TSNS. If the T/TSNS is initiated by a MAJCOM, the MAJCOM
   forwards it to AF/A3O-AR for Air Staff review. A MAJCOM-initiated T/TSNS would be
   appropriate when a new weapon system or weapon could require a significant change in
   test/training space configuration (e.g., F-22, JDAM, etc.).
3.3. Writing the T/TSNS. The T/TSNS shall be as clear and concise as possible, with a depth
and scope sufficient to allow a reasonable review and assessment. The document length does not
need to be more than five pages (not including any supporting attachments). The T/TSNS covers
the same subject matter as the formal DOPAA; however, it is not expected to address all items in
the level of detail required in a DOPAA. The T/TSNS should be an "in-house" effort, as opposed
to preparation by a contractor. The format for T/TSNS is as follows:
   3.3.1. Title: The title of the T/TSNS shall be a concise description of the concept and have a
   unique alphanumeric designation. The format will be: MAJCOM, 2-digit year, 3-digit
   sequence number (assigned by MAJCOM), unit or proponent, and the title of the initiative
   (Example: ACC-06-001: Anytown AFB, F-24 Beddown). Include on the title page the
   T/TSNS proponent‘s name and phone number.
   3.3.2. Operational Requirement/Justification: Briefly discuss what has changed. What
   MAJCOM specific requirement(s) are driving this action? Include unit and mission; other
   units concerned, if any, weapon systems characteristics and coordination accomplished to
   date.
AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                             29


   3.3.3. Concept: Briefly describe the concept and include maps that illustrate the current and
   future airspace/range structure, to include altitudes, legend, and a scale. The concept should
   detail who wants to do what, where, and why, including objectives of the action. How does
   the concept satisfy the need? Be sure to include: the boundary dimensions/description (**NM
   x **NM), the volume (10,000 feet MSL to FL 600), its attributes (use of chaff and flares,
   supersonic, threats, targets, frequency spectrum, mountainous terrain, etc.), the frequency and
   periods of use (0800-2200 Monday-Friday) and its proximity to the installation. This concept
   should not be so detailed as to prematurely eliminate potentially reasonable alternatives.
   3.3.4. Alternatives: Briefly list several alternatives to the concept, including a ―No Action‖
   alternative. Reasonable alternatives include those that are practical or feasible from a
   common sense, technical, and economic standpoint. In developing alternatives, consider
   alternatives that may be procedural or non-materiel in nature (e.g., renegotiation of LOAs
   with the Army, FAA, or Navy, or implementation of seasonally based deconfliction
   procedures during peak use periods). ―No Action‖ means the continuation of present
   management activities without implementing the concept. Impacts may include: quantifiable
   degradation to training, inability to meet mission objectives or higher headquarters direction,
   inefficiencies, costs, etc.
   3.3.5. Competing Interest Potential: T/TSNS actions have the potential to raise controversial
   issues, reaching to the national level, very early in the planning process. For this reason, it is
   important that USAF planning and review processes for airspace actions be as thorough as
   possible, with identification and involvement of concerned parties, public and private, early
   in the process. Understanding other stakeholder interests leads to ―win-win‖ alternatives.
   Public involvement in, and notification of, airspace actions and proposals is not just a legal
   requirement, but a smart and efficient way to increase the chances of success for a concept.
   USAF proponents should develop a plan early in the process to involve groups with
   competing interests in the process to achieve the desired results. Use all available resources
   (subject matter expertise, previous environmental actions, etc.) to assess any possible
   competing interests from stakeholders that may be impacted by your action. Briefly state in
   bullet format whether the concept or any of the alternatives may impact any of the following
   or other areas: recreational areas (parks: federal, state, and local); Native American
   reservations, lands, or areas of special interest; grazing or farming; endangered species;
   wildlife refuges; consultation with other state/federal agencies; archaeological sites; hunting
   and fishing areas; population centers, communities, previously identified or potential noise
   sensitive areas; ongoing litigation which may be impacted; other training space actions that
   may be impacted; and regional actions by other MAJCOMs or military departments. Identify
   if there are any outside agencies that have requested or, in your opinion, would support the
   concept (federal, state, local, and/or stakeholder groups) and if any coordination has been
   completed to date.
3.4. Processing an NSA Request. The NSA proposal should clearly state the rationale for the
NSA requirement and the proposed boundaries of the NSA (include a map). All NSA proposals
should be coordinated through the installation airspace and ATC offices. If local ATC service is
not provided by the requesting unit or host installation, coordinate the initiative with the ATC
facility providing this service before being forwarded to the wing/installation commander for
approval and subsequent submission to the MAJCOM.
 30                                           AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


   3.4.1. Following wing/installation commander approval, all NSA proposals will be
   forwarded to the MAJCOM airspace management office for appropriate HHQ coordination,
   with an information copy to the AFREP. AFREPs will not take action on NSA proposals
   until formal coordination has been requested by HQ AF/A3O-A.
   3.4.2. MAJCOM airspace management offices shall coordinate with respective ATC and
   security forces offices. Once approved by the MAJCOM, forward the NSA proposal to
   AF/A3O-AR.
       3.4.2.1. AF/A3O-AR will coordinate the proposal with SAF/GCN and other air staff
       agencies as appropriate. Once approved, AF/A3O-AR will forward the proposal to the
       AFREP for coordination with the FAA.
       3.4.2.2. The USAF recognizes the potential vulnerability of certain facilities to threats
       from the air. However, concerns about the effect of flight-restricted airspace on the NAS
       have traditionally outweighed the potential security benefits provided by such a
       designation. Despite the numerous sites that might logically be expected to qualify for
       prohibited airspace, at this time fewer than ten such prohibited areas exist across the
       United States. Based on historic FAA responses to restricted flight over USAF
       installations/activities, units should not plan to permanently establish flight avoidance
       areas over installations/activities to satisfy local security requirements. Should a specific
       and credible threat to an installation be identified, a TFR is the preferred alternative.
3.5. Post T/TSNS Environmental Analysis. Airspace and range actions are subject to
environmental analysis in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
of 1969 as promulgated in AFI 32-7061. AFI 32-7061 incorporates by reference Title 32, Code
of Federal Regulations, Part 989, Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP), current
edition, which is the controlling document on the Air Force EIAP. Develop concepts that
concern airspace under FAA jurisdiction according to the procedures outlined in FAAO 7400.2
and FAAO 7610.4. Overseas units will work with host nation and/or liaison officers regarding
proposed airspace actions. Submit USAF airspace actions to the FAA through the AFREP. The
AFREP will notify AF/A3O-AR when they receive the DOPAA. Airspace proposals for
temporary exercise airspace, provisions for short-term special missions outside of established
airspace, or similar actions should be reviewed by the MAJCOM with an information copy
routed through the AFREP to AF/A3O-AR.
   3.5.1. The proponent uses AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis,
   Section I, Proponent Information, to initiate the required environmental analysis process. The
   DOPAA is important for the successful initiation and completion of the process. To ensure
   proponents remain actively involved on the development of proposals and alternatives, it is
   recommended that units do not use contractors for this purpose. If contractors are used,
   proponent airspace managers must work closely with the contractor to ensure operational
   mission requirements are identified, airspace elements are specifically addressed, and
   potential impacts are adequately assessed.
       3.5.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) The DOPAA should include all new/additional flying
       activities proposed. These activities should be described in sufficient detail to allow
       someone reviewing the document to understand the nature and extent of the proposal. At
       a minimum, it should include all proposed flying activities, including type and number of
       airframes, use rates by day (0700-2200L) and night (2200-0700L), sorties/sortie-
AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                          31


      operations per month, and planned profiles (airspeeds and altitudes) to be flown. It
      should also include airspace utilization (MOAs and MTRs) where training and proposed
      flight activities are to be considered.
      3.5.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) The DOPAA should include all reasonable alternatives to
      include a no-action alternative. Questions on preparation and content of AF Form 813
      should be directed to the local environmental coordinator.
   3.5.2. Restricted Area proposals requesting designation from the surface will indicate that
   the proponent owns, leases, or by agreement controls the underlying surface. Failure to do so
   prior to submission of the proposal may delay processing.
3.6. Letters of Agreement (LOA). Develop actions that concern airspace under FAA
jurisdiction according to the procedures outlined in FAAOs 7400.2 and 7610.4. Additional
information on creating LOAs with the FAA is found in FAAO 7210.3 and AFI 13-203, Air
Traffic Control.
   3.6.1. FAAO 7610.4 provides guidance for the following airspace initiatives:
      3.6.1.1. ATC Services by the Military.
      3.6.1.2. Military Operations Requirements and Procedures [SUA/ATCAA].
      3.6.1.3. Central Altitude Reservation Function Responsibilities.
      3.6.1.4. FAA/North American Air Defense/Pacific Air Forces Procedures for Control of
      Air Defense Aircraft.
      3.6.1.5. Military Training Routes (MTR), IR.
      3.6.1.6. Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft.
3.7. Supersonic Operations. Conduct planned supersonic operations only under the following
conditions, and with appropriate consideration/evaluation of environmental impacts:
   3.7.1. Over open water areas, above 10,000 feet MSL and more than 15 NM from any land
   area.
   3.7.2. Over land areas, above 30,000 feet MSL.
   3.7.3. Avoid areas of population concentration and ―Avoidance Locations,‖ as well as HQ
   USAF specified critical areas listed in FLIP AP/1B.
      3.7.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) Supersonic operations above 30,000 feet mean sea level
      (MSL), or over water above 10,000 feet MSL and more than 15 NM from land, may be
      conducted only after environmental review in accordance with Title 32, CFR, Part 989,
      and approval by the Operations Group Commander. Recurring supersonic operations
      above 30,000 feet MSL, or over water as described above, should be documented on an
      AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis.
   3.7.4. If units require supersonic flight operations outside the parameters in paragraphs 3.7.1
   or 3.7.2 above, submit a waiver request through MAJCOM A3 channels (include
   coordination with the MAJCOM and unit level EIAP program managers). Waiver requests
   shall include the appropriate level of environmental analysis (environmental assessment [EA]
   or unsigned finding of no significant impact [FONSI] or draft environmental impact
32                                         AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


  statement [EIS]), and an airspace analysis documenting existing and projected airspace
  utilization, availability, and deficiencies (see Attachment 5). These materials must
  accompany the waiver request to AF/A3O-AR for Air Staff review, coordination
  (AF/A7CPB at a minimum) and approval. Send courtesy copies to the AFREP. Waivers will
  be valid for a period not to exceed 3-years.
     3.7.4.1. Submit requests for supersonic tests/exercises of short duration (30-days or less)
     through MAJCOM A3 channels to AF/A3O-AR for approval (with AF/A7CPB
     concurrence) at least 60-days before the mission requirement start date. Accompany
     waiver requests with the appropriate level of environmental analysis (EA or unsigned
     FONSI, or draft EIS).
     3.7.4.2. For recurring tests/exercises or tests/exercises of duration greater than 30-days,
     submit requests IAW para 3.7.4 at a minimum of 60-days before the mission start date.
     3.7.4.3. (Added-AFSOC) Supersonic operations below 30,000 feet MSL require an
     environmental assessment (at a minimum) and Air Staff approval IAW AFI 13-201. This
     pertains not only to permanent operations, but also to temporary test/exercises involving
     supersonic speeds. The DOPAA to establish/change supersonic flight areas/operations
     should arrive at HQ AFSOC/A3A as early as possible prior to its anticipated need. The
     process to obtain a permanent waiver for supersonic operations will take approximately
     36 months. This will allow for HQ AFSOC/A3A review, Air Staff coordination and
     approval. Proposed changes in supersonic operations due to a change in unit assigned
     weapon system(s), or a change in tactics, must be environmentally assessed prior to
     implementing the proposed change.
  3.7.5. The MAJCOM A3 in coordination with the MAJCOM EIAP program manager will
  review existing approved supersonic flying waivers for renewal every 3-years. MAJCOM
  airspace management offices will provide a courtesy copy of the waiver renewal package to
  AF/A30-AR (who will notify AF/A7CPB in turn) prior to MAJCOM A3 approval. The
  review will be conducted to ensure the operations (sortie limits, aircraft types, minimum
  altitudes, etc.--see Attachment 6), affected environments, and resulting impacts are
  consistent with the environmentally assessed and approved actions. Evaluate all adopted
  mitigation measures and commitments made in initially approving the supersonic flying
  operations for compliance. Detail changes to land use underneath the area of supersonic
  flight that have occurred since the original approval and include any updated environmental
  analysis. MAJCOM airspace management offices, EIAP, and other offices, as necessary,
  shall develop and maintain a management system for ensuring compliance and periodic
  monitoring. Promptly advise AF/A3O-AR of any environmental or operational condition
  warranting reconsideration of the decision approving supersonic flight operations (e.g., a
  different weapon system, environmental conditions, or a change in tactics). If the waiver
  renewal is not completed prior to the 3-year expiration date, the controlling MAJCOM A3
  (with environmental planning function coordination) is authorized to approve temporary
  continuation of existing supersonic operations below 30,000 feet MSL until the waiver is
  renewed. All requirements imposed by the original approval decision remain in effect.
     3.7.5.1. (Added-AFSOC) Units will submit a request for renewal to the appropriate
     civil engineering activity at least six months prior to expiration of the approved three-
AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                          33


       year period. Forward a copy of the locally coordinated renewal request to HQ
       AFSOC/A3AA.
   3.7.6. MAJCOM airspace management offices shall notify AF/A3O-AR of MAJCOM A3
   waiver renewals within 30-days and maintain supporting documents for a minimum of 10-
   years.
   3.7.7. Sonic Boom Events. The characteristics of sonic booms are such that damage to
   property may result. The USAF adjudicates sonic boom claims caused by Air Force, AFRC,
   and NGB aircraft. The staff judge advocate nearest the incident location usually investigates
   such claims or complaints. Commanders of units operating aircraft capable of supersonic
   flight or units that manage airspace used by such aircraft will establish internal methods to
   document unplanned supersonic flight activities over land or within 15 NM of a coast. The
   remarks section in Aircrew Resource Management System may be used for this purpose.
   Training or scheduling/utilization tools are also acceptable for this purpose. This data is not
   required for supersonic activity that is part of combat or combat support missions.
       3.7.7.1. Minimum information to be retained includes: callsign, type aircraft, unit,
       location of supersonic event, and route of flight.
          3.7.7.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Units will document supersonic flight activities over
          land or within 15NM of a coast. Information to be collected for each event will
          include at a minimum: aircraft callsign, aircraft type, unit, airspace or location, time
          of event, altitude of event and route of flight. Documentation will be maintained for
          two years IAW USAF Records Disposition Schedule Table 13-4, Rule 4, Table 13-4.
          Retain data pertaining to property damage claims investigation for five years.
       3.7.7.2. Acknowledgment of unauthorized supersonic activity will be made to the
       originating or scheduling activity of the airspace. Identifying DOD aircraft causing sonic
       booms permits the investigating judge advocate to confirm USAF involvement and
       obtain aircraft and flight data that are useful for computing the approximate magnitude of
       sonic booms.
       3.7.7.3. If flight data is classified, pilots should provide the minimum information
       needed to identify the flight and home base. Prompt acknowledgment of supersonic
       activity enables the judge advocate to conduct an immediate investigation, helps to
       promptly resolve pending claims, and enables PA officials to respond promptly to
       community and news media inquiries.
3.8. SUA Review Teams. The FAA SUA Review Program provides for a continuing review of
all airspace allocations IAW FAAO 7400.2. To supplement routine airspace programs and the
annual review afforded by Restricted Area/MOA utilization reports, the FAA may use SUA
review teams on an as required basis to examine selected areas. These teams coordinate their
visits to USAF units with the MAJCOM through the AFREP.
   3.8.1. These teams review selected areas, determine needed actions, and recommend a plan
   for efficient and safe use of airspace. They examine the current and planned use of SUA to
   minimize conflict with other airspace users. Based on the requirements of each user and
   actual use of airspace, they evaluate the need to retain, change, revoke, or establish SUA.
   Consideration should be given to returning associated ATCAAs when returning MOAs to the
   NAS.
 34                                          AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


   3.8.2. MAJCOMs should be prepared to provide the teams detailed documentation about
   scheduling, utilization times, altitudes, geographical areas used, type of air activities
   conducted, and future use plans (for the NGB, units will provide this documentation).
   Address national security requirements at an unclassified level unless team member security
   clearance authorizations are appropriately verified prior to the team visit. Military
   participation will be on a case-by-case basis.
   3.8.3. After evaluating the team's recommendations, the FAA, with the military's
   concurrence, may initiate procedural changes or airspace modifications.
   3.8.4. (Added-AFSOC) Reviewing Special Use Airspace Assignments. Units will forward
   SUA Review reports to HQ AFSOC/A3AA NLT 15 February each year. Unit airspace
   managers will maintain current SUA/MTR review checklists. Maintain documentation for
   each managed SUA, to include any authorized changes in the original proposed usage,
   LOP/LOAs and environmental documentation in accordance with USAF RDS, Table 13-4.
   Note: Complete SUA/MTR review checklists for Restricted Areas, MOAs, ATCAA,
   Instrument Routes (IRs) and Visual Routes (VRs) (AFI 13-201 Attachment 4).
3.9. Airspace Disposition Process. Responsible stewardship of airspace resources also
involves identifying those parcels of airspace no longer required by the USAF. However, the
airspace may meet the requirements of another user. Take the following steps, in order, for
returning unneeded airspace to the NAS:
   3.9.1. Originating activity notifies the MAJCOM of intention to return airspace.
       3.9.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) The         Operations    Group    Commander       will   sign   the
       correspondence.
   3.9.2. MAJCOMs solicit input from other units within the MAJCOM to determine if there
   are other USAF units with a need for the airspace. If a requirement is identified, the
   MAJCOM will notify the AFREP of their intention to reassign the airspace. AFREPs will
   assist with the FAA process.
NOTE:
 Changes in use of airspace, other than administrative in nature, require environmental
consideration per the EIAP.
   3.9.3. If no requirement is identified within that MAJCOM, the MAJCOM will notify
   AF/A3O-AR, who will solicit input from other MAJCOMs.
   3.9.4. If AF/A3O-AR determines there is no USAF requirement, AF/A3O-AR will notify the
   Airspace Subgroup of the PBFA, to determine if there is any other DOD requirement. If
   another Service has a need for the airspace, that Service would assume the lead for
   transferring the airspace. If there is no requirement, AF/A3O-AR will initiate action through
   the FAA/AJR-01 to return the airspace to the NAS. FAA/AJR-01 will maintain a listing of
   airspace returned to the NAS. This timeline should not exceed 4-months.
3.10. Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) Responsibilities. Disseminate time critical information
regarding changes impacting airspace (scheduling procedures, altitudes, etc.), either temporary or
not sufficiently known in advance, via NOTAM. A NOTAM may serve as notification of an
alteration until permanent publication on aeronautical charts or in other publications. It is the
AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                       35


responsibility of the airspace-scheduling agency to ensure that this information is revised and
submitted in accordance with the FAA AIM.
 36                                          AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


                                          Chapter 4

                                          GENERAL

4.1. Importance of Effective Community Relations. It is important to the overall efficiency of
the USAF that the public be continually informed about the flying mission. Effective community
relations dictate mutual respect for and recognition of factors affecting or affected by USAF
operations. The willingness to define the purpose, mission and need for airspace and aircraft
actions, enhances our credibility and increases public understanding and support for our
operations. Mitigating adverse impacts from USAF operations is a matter of effective
community relations. Coordinate all community relations issues with the unit PA Office.
   4.1.1. Keeping the Public Informed. Commanders should highlight in their PA programs the
   need for operational readiness and actions that contribute to the state of readiness. Public
   affairs programs should fully explain all measures taken by the USAF to avoid or mitigate
   possible disturbances to civilian communities, especially those communities situated under or
   near military airspace. Present this information not only to those communities in the
   immediate vicinity of the facility but also when applicable to stakeholders such as the FAA,
   NPS, BLM, USFS, USFWS, BIA, State Aviation Officials, and other bodies/groups focused
   on national aviation issues.
   4.1.1. (AFSOC) Participation in Public Meetings. Subordinate units will advise HQ
   AFSOC/A3AA of requests to participate in public meetings involving
   airspace/environmental issues. Airspace management representatives must ensure their
   personal comments are not construed as MAJCOM/HQ USAF‘s official position. The
   official HQ AFSOC position can only be determined after proper coordination with HQ
   AFSOC/A3A. All AFSOC Airspace Management representatives and operations personnel
   will accomplish risk communication training prior to actively participating in public
   meetings.
   4.1.2. Protection of the Civilian Population and Communities. The USAF has a
   responsibility to protect the public to the maximum extent practicable from the hazards and
   effects associated with flight operations.
       4.1.2.1. Units must be sensitive to USAF environmental and safety responsibilities and
       to the concerns of affected communities and aviation interests. Evaluation of flight
       activities, at least annually, will be an agenda item for the airspace manager at the wing
       Airfield Operations Board (AOB). Minutes of the AOB will serve as a written record of
       the annual evaluation.
          4.1.2.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Units will forward             meeting    minutes    to   HQ
          AFSOC/A3AA if not included in the AOB minutes.
       4.1.2.2. Review the effects of mission changes. Changes to air operations are likely to
       cause public concern or comment regarding environmental impacts and require
       environmental analysis as prescribed in AFI 32-7061. Avoid noise-sensitive areas to the
       maximum extent possible. If operations at low altitude are mission essential and justified
       with a documented requirement, comply with minimum safe altitudes as prescribed in
       AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules.
AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                          37


  4.1.3. Operations versus Readiness Impact. It is important for the USAF to recognize and
  communicate to the public the difference between an ―operational impact‖ and a ―readiness
  impact.‖ Although a particular public concern may have an impact on operations (routes,
  altitudes, turn points, etc.), the potential change to our operations may not impact our
  readiness. Conversely, a proposed restriction that would prohibit a bomber wing from
  dropping training ordnance could clearly affect the readiness of that unit. Recognizing the
  difference between these two concepts may create an opportunity for cooperation in
  negotiating or mitigating airspace issues.
     4.1.3.1. Readily available public information can be helpful in gaining support for USAF
     air operations. Units should:
         4.1.3.1.1. Establish a program to distribute information on military airspace and
         supersonic areas. Ensure coordination with the appropriate FAA facility (CONUS,
         Hawaii, and Alaska only).
         4.1.3.1.2. Develop an explanatory letter outlining the purpose, routes, areas, altitudes,
         intensity, day, and time of use of the areas or routes and location of existing operating
         areas or routes in the vicinity. Use aids such as charts, photographs, and film footage
         for visual clarification. Send the letter and appropriate visual materials through PA
         for release to appropriate community news media. Send this information to each
         interested stakeholder.
         4.1.3.1.3. Provide PA offices with information to be used in news releases for new
         areas and routes or major modifications to existing ones. Provide additional
         information for follow-up news releases as required.
         4.1.3.1.4. Ensure community and news media inquiries on changes to operational
         areas or routes are answered promptly.
  4.1.4. Congressional Interest. Because of increasing public and political sensitivities to
  military airspace, appropriate congressional offices should be informed of significant
  emerging mission requirements at the earliest opportunity. This serves to promote better
  understanding of the USAF‘s flying mission, and inform these congressional offices of future
  USAF airspace actions so that they may handle any public comments.
     4.1.4.1. Noise Complaints and Congressional Inquiries. When Congressional inquiries
     are received, timely and accurate response is paramount. MAJCOM-designated unit
     OPR/OCRs should include airspace and/or range management, stan-eval, PA, and airfield
     operations functions. AF/A3O-AR will be the A3/5 focal point for inquiries received at
     the Air Staff (typically from Congressional staffs, the Chief of Staff, or Secretary of the
     Defense/Air Force offices). AF/A3O-AR will coordinate through the MAJCOM airspace
     or range management function for inputs/responses to inquiries. MAJCOMs will
     establish their own procedures for internal research and response to these inquiries.
     Regardless of whom the MAJCOM designates for investigating these inquiries, the
     airspace or range management function needs to be an integral part of the process. Aside
     from possessing the expertise necessary in most cases to adequately respond, the airspace
     office needs to be sensitive to those areas or routes that are drawing public attention.
     Avoid referring callers to the other military departments, or government agencies without
 38                                          AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


       first attempting to answer questions concerning aircraft noise through all available means.
       AFREPs can provide considerable assistance regarding noise complaints.
NOTE:
 The intent of this paragraph is not to circumvent or supersede the MAJCOM or unit PA office
role in these issues. PA should be provided the opportunity to coordinate on responses to
congressional inquiries. If the MAJCOM does not directly task PA to respond, at the least
responses need to be coordinated with them, since in many cases, they may receive inquiries
directly. For information on Military Pilot Deviation processing or HATR, see AFI 91-202.
       4.1.4.1. (AFSOC) Noise complaints and Congressional inquiries originating from
       higher headquarters will be referred to the appropriate unit for investigation. AFSOC
       units will establish their own investigation procedures for handling these matters.
       4.1.4.2. (Added-AFSOC) Units will coordinate all responses to Congressional or other
       higher headquarters inquiries dealing with military training airspace through HQ
       AFSOC/A3AA.
   4.1.5. Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ). Operations personnel assist CE in
   establishing and maintaining (where applicable) an active AICUZ program by providing
   flying operations data required for developing noise contours. Support development of
   maximum feasible land use compatibility between air installations and neighboring
   communities according to policy and guidance issued by AF/A7CPB. For specific
   information on the AICUZ program, see AFI 32-7063, Air Installation Compatible Use Zone
   Program.
   4.1.6. Visits and Statements. Coordinate all official visits to HQ FAA through FAA/AJR-01.
   Coordinate all official visits to FAA service area offices through the applicable AFREP.
   Inform the AFREPs of all issues other than routine operational coordination between the
   USAF and applicable FAA offices. MAJCOMs or HQ USAF must approve comments,
   commitments (LOAs, Memorandums of Understandings, etc.), and opinions regarding
   airspace or other aeronautical matters covered by this instruction prior to going outside the
   USAF. (This does not prevent routine coordination between operating elements of the USAF,
   FAA, and host nation ATC agencies or officials.)
       4.1.6.1. (Added-AFSOC) FAA Airspace Review/Government Accounting Office
       (GAO)/Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA) Visits. HQ AFSOC/A3AA is the central point
       of contact for coordinating FAA/GAO/AFAA inquiries concerning airspace matters.
       Report unscheduled visits/inquiries from these agencies to HQ AFSOC/A3AA.
4.2. Applicable Federal Aviation Requirements.
   4.2.1. Public Law 85-726, The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, created the FAA
   and charged the FAA Administrator with managing all national airspace under United States
   jurisdiction, including US Protectorates and designated Flight Information Regions. Because
   DOD airspace requirements often compete with those of commercial and general aviation
   and may impact public freedom to transit certain airspace, DOD military services have a
   special interest in presenting credible requirements to the FAA and managing allocated
   airspace efficiently.
AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                         39


   4.2.2. Title 5 United States Code Sections 551–559, Administrative Procedure Act. Requires
   public notice before the FAA can carry out certain airspace management actions, including
   military actions. The FAA notifies the public of an airspace proposal through a Notice of
   Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) published in the Federal Register, or by distributing to
   known interested parties a non-rulemaking circular that describes the proposal. Either of
   these methods sets forth the proposal and specifies a period of time in which the FAA will
   receive comments or suggestions. The FAA will publish its final decision, stating whether or
   not the proposal was modified as a result of the comments or suggestions received. If the
   FAA's final decision makes minor changes to the original proposal, a second NPRM or
   circular is not usually required. In all cases, the FAA makes the final decision on SUA
   proposals.
   4.2.3. Waivers to 14 CFR, Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs). Send four copies of FAA
   Form 7711-2, Application for Certificate of Waiver or Authorization, (available from FAA
   Service Area Offices) through military command channels to AFFSA/A3OF, who sends the
   original and two copies to the FAA.
NOTE:
 Waivers for airshow issues (speed, minimum safe altitudes, parachute jumping, etc.) should be
submitted directly to the local Flight Standards District Office.
   4.2.4. Exemption to 14 CFR Part 91.117 (Speed Authorization). 14 CFR Part 91.117 states
   that no person may operate an aircraft below 10,000 feet MSL at an indicated airspeed of
   more than 250 knots. Recognizing that some DOD aircraft performance requirements exceed
   250 knots, the FAA issued an exemption to 14 CFR Part 91.117. However, it is not a blanket
   waiver. Conditions under which operations are authorized below 10,000 feet MSL can be
   found in FAAO 7610.4.
   4.2.5. Obtaining FAA Publications and Forms. Most of the FAA publications and forms
   referenced in this instruction are available through the unit publications manager. Units
   having difficulty obtaining publications or needing a publication on short notice or on a one-
   time basis (such as an Advisory Circular) may contact the FAA field offices.
4.3. International, Foreign National Operations, and Combat Airspace. USAF procedures
governing operations in international or foreign national airspace must recognize the right of a
foreign government to establish and enforce procedures for operations within its sovereign
airspace. AF/A3O-AR oversees international and foreign operations.
   4.3.1. Host nation laws, regulations, and procedures are usually stated in AIP, ICAO Rules
   and Practices, or locally published directives. Non-conflicting USAF and DOD directives
   apply in foreign national airspace.
   4.3.2. A designated US military operational command may manage combat or contingency
   airspace during times of tension, contingencies, or war. AF/A3O-AR is the OPR for combat
   airspace management procedures and development of related policy and doctrine.
   4.3.3. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Policy. ICAO documents specify
   standards and recommend practices for international flight operations and ATC. Govern
   USAF flight operations in international and foreign national airspace by these standards and
   practices, as supplemented by ICAO member nations AIP, non-conflicting applications of
 40                                      AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


   USAF or DOD directives, and special LOAs for strategic, tactical readiness, or training
   operations. See FLIP and DOD Foreign Clearance Guide.
4.4. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Certificate of Authorization (COA). To obtain a
COA through the FAA for UAS, units should consult FAAO 7610.4 and their AFREP for
guidance on processing COA applications through FAA ATO Service Area channels.
AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                           41

                                           REPORTS

5.1. Need for Reports. Report data is of ever-increasing value to airspace managers at all
levels. Accurate reporting is critical in many decisions affecting military airspace: BRAC data
collection, environmental impact analysis, and legal actions to name a few. See paragraphs 5.3
and 5.4 for reports that the FAA requires. USAF scheduling agencies may need to provide use
data on military airspace on a case-by-case basis; therefore, maintain data on all designated
airspace (CONUS, Hawaii, and Alaska only).
5.2. Airspace Denial Report. Each USAF using agency should submit denial reports via the
report in Attachment 7. Airspace proposals initiated because of inadequate airspace due to FAA
restrictions (capping, time limitations, etc.) have a much better chance of success when
accompanied by denial reports. The report should include denials or restrictions in availability of
military airspace. Forward the report through appropriate channels to MAJCOM Airspace
Management office and the AFREP as required. Reports are submitted as required by event,
although MAJCOMs may stipulate other reporting requirements. This report is designated
emergency status code D. Discontinue reporting during emergency conditions. Do not report
during MINIMIZE.
   5.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) Airspace Denial Report. Units must document, via a brief
   narrative, each airspace denial.       If an unsatisfactory trend develops, inform HQ
   AFSOC/A3AA. HQ AFSOC/A3A will work with AFREPs and FAA Liaisons to resolve the
   issue. If this fails to resolve the issue, HQ AFSOC/A3A will forward the report to HQ
   USAF/A3O-A for resolution. Note: Altitude restrictions are considered airspace denials.
5.3. Annual Restricted Area Utilization Report. Each USAF scheduling agency must submit
a restricted area use report by 1 December every year (covering the period of 1 October through
30 September, or for any part of the preceding 12-month period ending 30 September). Prepare
reports according to FAAO 7400.2. Submit these reports for all US (including territories and
possessions) restricted areas:
   5.3.1. Send the restricted area use report through the MAJCOM to the AFREP. Assign the
   Interagency Report Control Number (IRCN) 1412-DOT-AN.
   5.3.2. NGB units report directly through their State Adjutant General to the regional AFREP
   and send an info copy to NGB/A3A.
   5.3.3. The AFREP will send one copy to the Director of Operations in the FAA service area
   having jurisdiction over the airspace being reported; one copy to the Director of System
   Operations Airspace and AIM, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue,
   SW, Room 400E, Washington, DC 20591; and one copy to AF/A3O-AR, 1621 North Kent
   Street, Rosslyn Plaza E Suite 320, Arlington, VA 22209.
   5.3.4. (Added-AFSOC) Reports are due at HQ AFSOC/A3AA via electronic transmission
   NLT 15 November.
5.4. Annual Military Operations Area (MOA) Utilization Report. Each USAF scheduling
agency must submit a MOA utilization report by 1 January every year (covering the period of 1
October through 30 September, or for any part of the preceding 12 month period ending 30
 42                                           AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


September). Prepare reports according to FAAO 7400.2. Submit these reports for all US
(including territories and possessions) MOAs.
5.4. (AFSOC)4. (Added) Reports are due at HQ AFSOC/A3AA via electronic transmission
NLT 15 December.
   5.4.1. Send this report through MAJCOM to the AFREP. Assign the IRCN 1412-DOT-AN.
   5.4.2. NGB units must report directly through their State Adjutant General to the regional
   AFREP and send an info copy to NGB/A3A.
   5.4.3. The AFREP will send one copy to the Director of Operations in the FAA service area
   having jurisdiction over the airspace being reported; one copy to the Director of System
   Operations Airspace and AIM, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue,
   SW, Room 400E, Washington, DC 20591; and one copy to AF/A3O-AR, 1621 North Kent
   Street, Rosslyn Plaza E Suite 320, Arlington, VA 22209.
5.5. Release of SUA/ASU Utilization Data. Although USAF does not release detailed
information to the public, generic data (i.e., we flew XX sorties on XX route, MOA, etc., during
the month of _______) is an acceptable response to inquiries requesting information on
SUA/ASU utilization. More detailed data should be considered as For Official Use Only.
5.6. (Added-AFSOC) Spill-Out Reports. Units will maintain documentation of alleged DOD
spill-outs from SUA including date, time, type of aircraft, call sign, number of aircraft, airspace
designation and reason (if known) in a brief narrative. Inform HQ AFSOC/A3AA of alleged
spill-outs that may attract public attention.
5.7. (Added-AFSOC) Airspace Intrusions Reports. Report alleged civil aircraft violations of
military SUA to the FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO). FSDO requires nature of the
incident, time of occurrence and tail number (if known) of the alleged violating aircraft. Note:
This report is not a substitute for the USAF Hazardous Air Traffic Report.

     OBSTRUCTION EVALUATION/AIRPORT AIRSPACE ANALYSIS (OE/AAA)

6.1. General. Responsibility for policy and procedures for the USAF OE/AAA Program is
located within AF/A3O-AD. The OE/AAA system is designed to identify obstacles that affect
military airfields and military airspace (CONUS, Hawaii, and Alaska only).
   6.1.1. OE/AAA Program Manager Responsibilities. Management of the OE/AAA Program
   resides in the AFREP Eastern Service Area office. The program manager is responsible for
   providing policy oversight, training, daily operations, and interface with other DOD services
   and FAA Obstruction Evaluation Service (OES) personnel. The program manager will test
   all system modifications and enhancements to DOD modules prior to implementation.
   6.1.2. OE/AAA Specialist Responsibilities. The specialist is responsible for ensuring the
   program is executed daily. The specialist will distribute Obstruction Evaluations/Landing
   Area proposals affecting military airspace to the airspace manger according to program
   capabilities.
   6.1.3. Airspace Manager Responsibilities. Units are responsible for evaluating detrimental
   effects on military airspace in accordance with FAAO 7400.2. When responding to proposed
   construction or a landing area proposal, the unit shall identify the detrimental effects in detail
   to the appropriate OE cell specialist via email within 10 working days. The unit shall contact
   the appropriate OE cell specialist to request additional time if needed. A response to OE‘s
   and non-rulemaking airports (NRAs) is required. If no response is received from the unit, the
   OE/AAA cell specialist will contact the MAJCOM for action.
   6.1.4. MAJCOM Responsibilities. MAJCOMs will notify the USAF OE/AAA Program
   Manager in the event of a new airspace manager being assigned. They shall respond on
   behalf of the unit in the event the unit airspace manager cannot respond to OE cases.
6.2. Obstacle Evaluation Processing.
   6.2.1. OE cases in the vicinity of an existing structure: If the structure is located on an
   ―antenna farm‖ (multiple antennas in a localized area) and is not higher than the other
   structures, the case can be closed out. If the structure is of greater height or more than 1 NM
   from another structure, the case shall be sent to the airspace manager using the ―For Your
   Information‖ (FYI) letter (see Attachment 8) and closed out with the military statement. The
   military statement can be found in para 6.1.4.3.1.
   6.2.2. OE cases involving proposed construction: The case will be sent for comment using
   the SUA Letter (see Attachment 9) if the structure is located in an area where it is the only
   structure. If the structure is located on an ―antenna farm‖ and is not higher than the other
   structures, the case can be closed out.
   6.2.3. Structures that penetrate the floor of military airspace will comply with the instruction
   for filing an aeronautical objection in para 6.1.5. For structures within 100 feet of the floor of
   military operations, cases will be addressed using the FYI letter and the military statement
   and closed out. If the structure is more than 100 feet from the floor, the case can be closed
   out.
 44                                           AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


   6.2.4. Slow Routes: If the structure is located in an area with other structures of the same
   height, the case can be closed out. If the structure is higher, then the case can be closed out
   with the military statement. If the structure is of greater height and more than 1NM from
   another structure, it will be sent to the airspace manager using the FYI letter.
6.3. Non-Rulemaking Airports (NRA).
   6.3.1. For proposed landing areas or expansion of existing fields that underlie SUA or ASU,
   cases will be sent to airspace manager for comment using the NRA Letter (see Attachment
   10).
   6.3.2. For proposed construction on civil airports that underlie special use airspace, cases
   will be sent to airspace manager for comment.
   6.3.3. For proposed construction on civil airports or proposed landing areas under SRs, cases
   will be sent an NRA FYI Letter (see Attachment 11) including the military statement.
6.4. OE Case Response Statements.
   6.4.1. The following is an example of a military statement for an OE case where there is no
   hazard: ―While the structure does not constitute a hazard to air navigation, it would be
   located within or near a military training area and/or route.‖
   6.4.2. The following is an example of a statement for an OE case where there is no hazard
   for NRA case: ―Please advise the proponent that the airfield will be located within the
   confines or near a military training route or military training area.‖
6.5. Contents of an Aeronautical Objection. The USAF may object to the development of an
obstruction, airport, etc., which interferes with operations. The airspace manager must forward
all objections to the OE/AAA specialist. The objection may contain the following: definition of
the problem, detailed list of the assumptions, discussion of all the facts relevant to the problem,
discussion of all practicable solutions and justification of the selected solutions, and description
of any economic aspect in detail to show the effect on USAF operations. The objection must
include as a minimum (as applicable):
   6.5.1. Compromise of existing or proposed ATC procedures (i.e., airport traffic patterns,
   routings to and from MTRs, future area navigation/global positioning system procedures,
   etc.).
   6.5.2. Conflict with existing or proposed operations in SUA or on MTRs.
   6.5.3. Interference with established communication and/or radar frequencies (information
   only, part of FAA determination but could impact the USAF).
   6.5.4. Conflict with either existing or proposed navigational aid (NAVAID) operations or
   use (information only, part of the FAA determination but could impact USAF).
   6.5.5. As an alternative, use the following statement to negotiate with the proponent through
   the FAA OES specialist: ―The proposed structure constitutes a hazard to air navigation
   because it penetrates the floor of the military training route/military training area by ____
   number of feet. Request it be lowered by ____ feet or relocated ____ NM (North, South,
   East, West) to avoid a hazard to military operations.‖
AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                          45


   6.5.6. (Added-AFSOC) Aeronautical objections are forwarded through HQ AFSOC/A3AA
   to the appropriate AFREP and Obstruction Evaluation/Airport Airspace Analysis (OE/AAA)
   office.
6.6. Wind Generated Energy Facilities (WGEF).
   6.6.1. The USAF must sustain a safe flying environment while accomplishing its missions.
   This section provides methods for evaluating the siting of wind generated energy facilities
   (WGEF) on or near installations, communications/radar facilities, lands, airfields,
   assault/drop zones, ranges and airspace, etc; hereafter referred to as ―air operations.‖
   6.6.2. The USAF views the development and use of renewable energy as a national priority
   and is a partner in cooperation with federal and state agencies, and communities in promoting
   alternative energy resources. The USAF will work with these and other related parties to
   minimize the impact WGEF may have on air operations.
   6.6.3. There is currently no single source or method of identifying all WGEF proposals.
   WGEF project proposals may be received from many sources including the FAA, DOI,
   city/county/state planning and zoning agencies, community leaders, and other organizations
   including wind energy developers/associations. The wind generation developer, hereafter
   referred to as the ―proponent,‖ may not be aware of the potential impacts a proposal may
   have on USAF air operations. Therefore, it is critical to actively inform all WGEF
   stakeholders of USAF interest in any effort.
   6.6.4. USAF personnel must ensure proposals are quickly relayed to potentially affected
   units. Units are responsible for determining the potential impact on current and
   planned/future operations and will assess the proposed site for flight safety hazards,
   electromagnetic frequency interference, operational security, and other encroachment factors
   (see Attachment 12 for guidelines) (CONUS, Hawaii, and Alaska only).
   6.6.5. Active community outreach programs provide the best means of identifying proposals
   that may encroach on air operations. Outreach should include, but is not limited to, those
   with land management authority, BLM and USFS. It should also include agencies
   responsible for energy development, such as state energy agencies and commissions, energy
   associations and local offices of the Department of Energy DOE. Early analysis and
   identification of potential impacts may prevent unnecessary effort and expenditure on behalf
   of the proponent. The siting of a wind anemometer or meteorological data collection tower(s)
   is the first and most critical step for the proponent in assessing the potential of wind energy
   development. It is imperative that the USAF becomes involved no later than this point. Since
   the OE/AAA process does not evaluate all construction of facilities/equipment less than 200
   feet AGL, these facilities/equipment may not undergo automatic obstacle evaluation unless
   close to an airfield. If WGEF proposals are on USAF lands, the unit will ensure these
   proposals are submitted for review under the OE/AAA program requirements (CONUS,
   Hawaii, and Alaska only).
      6.6.5.1. WGEF proposals may be received by one unit, yet impact others. The following
      procedures are to be used for obstacles that do not fall under the provisions of the
      OE/AAA process. The receiving unit will identify the owner of the affected airspace
      within 24 hours of receipt; the impacted owner will then be the OPR to coordinate the
      USAF response. The OPR should coordinate with affected units and the proponent to
46                                          AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


     establish an estimated response time. Normally, proponents expect a response within two
     weeks, but several factors may determine the ultimate response time (e.g., number of
     units, MAJCOMs and other services affected). A single response should be provided
     addressing the most restrictive requirement (i.e., if one unit is affected, than the response
     should reflect that impact). Responses should be short and concise (a memo, via e-mail or
     fax); state if the proposal will or will not impact operations; how that conclusion was
     reached; if the proposal is proceeding as planned or is being modified, whether or not
     further negotiations are necessary, etc. Include a POC for each affected unit; these unit
     POCs will also be provided to the proponent. The OPR will provide courtesy response to
     higher headquarters (MAJCOM and AF/A3O-AR), the AFREP (see Figure 1.1) and the
     regional Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE) office (see
     Attachment 13). AF/A3O-AR will be responsible for forwarding the proposal to other
     Air Staff offices as required. If issues cannot be resolved at the local level, the OPR
     should contact the MAJCOM Airspace Management Office as soon as possible for
     further guidance. (CONUS, Hawaii, and Alaska only).
  6.6.6. When drafting a response, the POC should work closely with range operations,
  airfield operations, airspace managers, ATC, CE community planners, or AICUZ Program
  Manager and environmental representatives to develop a strategy for analyzing areas within
  which WGEF would be compatible, conditionally compatible, or incompatible. One
  methodology is the use of a simple ―Stoplight‖ chart (see Attachment 14). In the vicinity of
  airfields, any analysis should take into consideration the airfield criteria found in UFC 3-260-
  01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design. Once developed, this analysis should be
  shared with the AFREP, AFCEE Regional Office, MAJCOM, AF/A3O-AR, land use
  planning organizations (city, county, regional and state), federal land management agencies
  and any state energy associations (CONUS, Hawaii, and Alaska only).

       7210.3.
       7.3.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) The unit commander will ensure copies of the LOA are
       distributed to appropriate units.
   7.3.2. (Added-AFSOC) A LOP is required when a Restricted Area is designated as joint-
   use. The format for the LOP is in FAAO JO 7400.2, Part 7. A LOP should be accomplished
   with the controlling agency to outline operating procedures within the Restricted Area. LOPs
   are processed using the same procedures as LOAs.
7.4. (Added-AFSOC) Waivers. Due to unique local situations, units may request waivers to
this supplement. Forward requests via e-mail or letter through the SOW/CC to HQ
AFSOC/A3AA. Describe the specific factors which resulted in the request for waiver. If
approved, the waiver stays in effect indefinitely, unless HQ AFSOC/A3AA specifies otherwise,
cancels it in writing, or issues a change that alters the basis for the waiver. The unit office of
primary responsibility (OPR) must coordinate with the base publications manager to include the
waiver in the applicable base publication.
7.5. (Added-AFSOC) Alleged Airspace Violations. HQ AFSOC/A3AA will forward alleged
violations to the appropriate wing airspace manager. The wing airspace manager will investigate

7.6. (Added-AFSOC) Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft
(MARSA). When missions and tactics require aircraft to fly in closer proximity than normal
AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                          49


ATC approved separation standards, military authorities must accept responsibility for separation
of participating aircraft and ensure implementation with the appropriate ATC facility. A LOA is
required. For air refueling operations, MARSA applies between the tanker and the receivers. An
aircrew does not have the authority to invoke MARSA at any time. Authority to exercise
MARSA is retained by HQ AFSOC except as follows:
   7.6.1. (Added-AFSOC) Special operations wing (SOW) commanders may grant
   authorization for MARSA for separation of their unit owned aircraft. MARSA is
   accomplished through proper mission planning, adequate aircrew briefings, insistence on
   proper aircrew technique, and crew discipline according to the appropriate directive.
   7.6.2. (Added-AFSOC) Civilian contract flight operations, including remote ground or air
   controlled Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)/Remote Piloted Aircraft (RPA), may be
   authorized to use MARSA by HQ AFSOC/A3 or SOW commanders in conjunction with
   AFSOC supported or authorized flight activity. Units shall brief participating pilots on
   appropriate air safety and LOA airspace procedures before conducting flight operations.
   7.6.3. (Added-AFSOC) Separation Requirements. Specify the provisions for the use of
   MARSA in a LOA or LOP with the appropriate controlling agency/ATC facility or other
   appropriate governing document and use MARSA only for Instrument Flight Rule (IFR)
   operations. MARSA applies at all times during air refueling, cell/en route formation, altitude
   reservation, air intercept training and formation takeoffs. It is accomplished through strict
   adherence to specified procedures. Aircrews not familiar with the MARSA separation will
   be provided with a pre-mission brief on the specified separation criteria by the scheduling
   unit.
7.7. (Added-AFSOC) Military Training Route and Slow Route Planning Criteria:
   7.7.1. (Added-AFSOC) Minimum Altitudes. All MTRs will be designed to place the
   aircraft at the lowest altitude necessary to meet mission requirements consistent with flight
   safety, whether at IFR or Terrain Avoidance/Terrain Following(TA/TF) altitude. (Note: In
   no case will the floor of a new MTR be established below 100 feet AGL.) Lateral separation
   from obstructions will be preferred to higher altitudes over obstructions. Every effort will be
   made to design route segments for TFR operations so as to avoid man-made obstructions. In
   certain cases, minimum operating altitudes will be dictated by environmental constraints.
   7.7.2. (Added-AFSOC) Top of Block Altitudes. IFR altitudes will be established for each
   IR segment to provide a minimum clearance of 1000 feet above the highest
   obstruction/terrain within the designated route width and a minimum clearance of 500 feet
   above the highest obstruction/terrain within five miles beyond the route width on each side.
   7.7.3. (Added-AFSOC) Terrain Avoidance/Terrain Following (TA/TF) Clearance Plane
   Setting (CPS) (Bombers Only). Individual units will be responsible for establishing
   clearance plane settings for training routes/MOAs and restricted areas for all applicable
   airspace used by their unit. TA/TF altitudes will be established for each MTR with every
   effort to establish the lowest altitude consistent with flight safety. TA/TF clearance plane
   setting (CPS) will provide at least 200 feet clearance above known man-made obstructions
   within the route corridor. Aircrews are advised that CPSs provide no buffer outside the route
   limits; obstructions higher than the approved TA/TF altitudes could be present immediately
   adjacent to the route perimeter. Aircrews are advised that not all known vertical obstructions
 50                                           AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


   are depicted on standard NGA Tactical Pilotage Charts (TPC) due to cartographic
   limitations. The number of CPSs will be minimized to balance safety and training benefits.
   7.7.4. (Added-AFSOC) Route Width. MTR corridor widths shall be of sufficient size to
   contain all planned activities. Unless specifically approved by HQ AFSOC/A3AA the total
   corridor width will not exceed 20NM.
       7.7.4.1. (Added-AFSOC) Route Width (Corridor). MTR boundary limits within which
       aircraft are restricted to conduct operations. Route width will normally be defined in
       FLIP AP/1B as a distance right and left of route centerline. In some cases, when
       approved by HQ AFSOC/A3A, the route corridor may be defined as a series of
       coordinates. Outside turns causing gaps in the route corridor, when not defined
       otherwise, will be closed using the following method:
           7.7.4.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Draw a line perpendicular to the outbound course line
           from the turn-point towards the outside of the corner and mark the spot where it
           intersects its route width corridor (temporarily label as point #3).
           7.7.4.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) Draw a line outward from the turn-point that bisects the
           angle formed by the steps identified in paragraph 7.8.4.1.1.
           7.7.4.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) Calculate the average route width for the two segments,
           and mark that distance on the line created IAW paragraph 7.8.4.1.2. (temporarily
           label as point #2).
           7.7.4.1.4. (Added-AFSOC) Connect the three points.
   7.7.5. (Added-AFSOC) MTR Closure. The originating activity, scheduling unit or
   controlling agency may close a route to all aircraft whenever hazardous conditions, accidents,
   conflicting traffic conditions, or environmental concerns warrant. Notify the controlling
   agency and all scheduled users of the closure. Aircrews will not enter a low level route after
   being advised it is closed. When a MTR has not been closed by one of the above agencies, it
   is the responsibility of the using unit to evaluate flight conditions and determine whether or
   not conditions warrant low altitude flight. The final decision on whether or not to enter or
   abort a low-level route rests with the aircrew and will be based on evaluation of forecasts or
   existing conditions. The wing scheduling activity will establish procedures for closing
   routes.
7.8. (Added-AFSOC) Low Level Bird Strike Hazards and Aircrew Reporting
Procedures. Bird strikes are a year-round hazard and unit planners must consider the bird threat
when scheduling low-level operations. The large number of different bird species with varying
flight habits results in bird activity at all times of day or night. The most hazardous time is from
sunset to 0100L during waterfowl migration season. However, the primary year-round threat is
soaring raptors. Aircrews that observe hazardous low-level bird activity must report the bird
sighting to their local safety office and MTR scheduling agency. When possible, the hazardous
bird sighting report should include, at a minimum, the following information: location, altitude,
size of flock (i.e., small bird, large bird). Note: The Chief of Airspace Management should
notify the wing/unit safety office of planned route surveys and dates. This notification will
provide the safety office the opportunity to accomplish their bird hazard survey in conjunction
with the required route survey(s).
AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                         51


7.9. (Added-AFSOC) Weather Information. Weather support for aircrews flying MTRs will
be provided by the using unit weather shop unless otherwise specified in a letter of agreement or
route Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). Aircrews will pre-brief Pilot-to-Metro Service
(PMSV) contact in advance. Prior to penetration to the low altitude route/airspace, aircrews will
attempt to contact one of the weather flight PMSV stations designated during the pre-takeoff
briefing for the latest information of significant en route weather.
7.10. (Added-AFSOC) VFR Traffic Avoidance (See and Avoid). CFR, Title 14, Part 91
permits VFR operation in areas outside controlled airspace with flight visibility down to one
mile. This is less restrictive than the requirements of AFI 11-202V3. Therefore, the
responsibility to observe and avoid other traffic is an integral part of flying MTRs in weather
conditions equal to or better than one mile visibility.
7.11. (Added-AFSOC) Review of Environmental Decision Documents. Each AFSOC CAM
will conduct a review of all applicable environmental decision documents by 15 March each year
to ensure that training operations are in strict compliance with and within the scope of all
relevant environmental analyses, including any existing management actions or mitigations. In
addition ensure similar strict compliance by others using AFSOC training airspace and assets.
This review should be coordinated through the unit‘s installation environmental planning
function. Report compliance to HQ AFSOC/A3AA.

Terms
Aeronautical Objection—A written objection to proposed construction, to an airspace proposal,
or to a proposed facility that infringes (or is believed to infringe) on the safe, orderly, and
expeditious flow of air traffic.
Aeronautical Proposal—A written proposal of (but not limited to) construction of any new
airport, any manmade obstruction that would extend into the navigable airspace, the
establishment or change of SUA (including any special or unusual air traffic control procedures)
and the establishment of or change to any new or existing NAVAID. Accomplish the preliminary
review process (T/TSNS) IAW Chapter 3 prior to initiating any aeronautical proposal action
associated with establishment or change of SUA.
Aerial Refueling (AR) Airspace—Airspace developed according to the provisions of FAAO
7610.4 to conduct air refueling.
 56                                           AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


(Added-AFSOC) AFSOC Units—Any AFSOC organization, including DRUs below the NAF
level.
Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA)—Defined airspace normally within the
Class A airspace (above 18,000 feet MSL) and established in accordance with FAAO 7610.4 by
a LOA with the ATC facility having responsibility for the airspace.
Airspace Action—The procedural act of designation, redesignation, modification, or revocation
of a parcel of airspace.
Airspace Concept—For identification purposes, the informal initial requests for additional
military airspace are referred to as ‗concepts‘ and generally a concept is part of the T/TSNS
process.
Airspace for Special Use (ASU)—Used to collectively identify non-SUA assets. ASU is
airspace of defined dimensions wherein activities must be confined because of their nature, and/
or wherein limitations may be imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those
activities.
Airspace for Special Use (ASU) Designations—These designations are in FAAO 7610.4 or
military documents. None are rulemaking actions and some (contained solely in military
documents) do not require coordination with the FAA for establishment.
Airspace Proposal—Having been through the T/TSNS process, an airspace proposal is the
formal portion of requests for airspace through the FAA. There must be a clearly defined need
and justification for obtaining or revising airspace.
Alert Area—Airspace designated to inform pilots of a high level of training activity or any
unusual activity where prior knowledge would significantly enhance air safety.
(Added-AFSOC) Bomber Route—A low altitude military training route which has been
evaluated for bomber operations. Bombers may conduct operations on other routes provided a
unit assessment of environmental concerns, BASH, obstruction hazards, turn radius
requirements, necessary climb/descent gradients between route segment altitudes and minimum
clearance plane settings for TA/TF operations has been accomplished. Bomber schedulers must
ensure the safe separation of aircraft by coordinating deconfliction procedures with the
appropriate route scheduling activity listed in FLIP. Coordination should include at a minimum
the airspeeds to be flown, entry and exit times, deviation allowed from the coordinated times (i.e.
+/- 5 minutes) and separation to be provided from other flights. Weather support is provided by
the using unit unless otherwise specified.
Controlled Firing Area (CFA)—CFAs contain civilian and military activities that could be
hazardous to non-participating aircraft.
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)—The codification of the general and permanent rules
published in the Federal Register by the executive departments and agencies of the Federal
Government. It is divided into 50 titles that represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation.
Each volume of the CFR is updated once each calendar year and is issued on a quarterly basis.
14 CFR represents Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which contains the Federal
Aviation Regulation (FAR) parts.
AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                             57


Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP)—The formal process, as outlined in the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), used to assess environmental impacts resulting
from a proposed action.
(Added-AFSOC) Exclusive Use of Airspace—Only participating aircraft engaged in the same
mission or activity are authorized to operate simultaneously within a specified airspace area.
This does not prohibit the scheduling activity/airspace manager from segregating separate
missions and/or activities through airspace subdivisions/altitude blocks to use airspace and
support mission requirements efficiently.
Federal Register—An official publication that provides a uniform system for making available
to the public regulations and legal notices issued by Federal agencies. These include Presidential
proclamations and executive orders, Federal agency documents having general applicability and
legal effect, documents required to be published by an Act of Congress, and other Federal
agency documents of public interest. All rulemaking actions are published in the Federal
Register.
Low-Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) Area—Usually large geographic areas established
for random VFR, low altitude navigation training.
(Added-AFSOC) Man—Made Obstructions–Structures which present a hazard to flight.
Structure height is measured from the terrain surface.
Maneuver Area—A designated segment of an IR or VR where aircraft may perform various
maneuvers dictated by operational requirements. The entire MTR is considered a
Corridor/Maneuver Area except where stated otherwise in FLIP. Aircraft vary their route of
flight and altitudes in the corridor to avoid obstacles, reduce noise impacts, and achieve IFR or
VFR point-to-point navigation and tactical training. Maneuver areas are not substitutes for
MOAs. Do not develop maneuver areas in lieu of MOAs. Include details of maneuver area
operations in the IR/VR proposal.
Military Airspace—A collective term used to indicate both Special Use Airspace (SUA) and
Airspace for Special Use (ASU).
Military Briefing Guides—Unit maintained briefing guides for each MTR that include route
deconfliction procedures, special operating procedures, and/or constraints not listed in current
FLIP AP/1B.
Military Operations Area (MOA)—Airspace designated for nonhazardous military activity,
established outside the Class A airspace (below 18,000 feet MSL) and within US territorial
airspace.
(Added-AFSOC) Mountainous Terrain—Terrain that varies more than 1000 feet in elevation
within 10 NM of a published track (MTR). When the track crosses a narrow gorge in such a way
that the aircraft will not descend into the gorge, the low point of the gorge will not be considered.
The approving authority may consider the route mountainous if certain terrain features present a
hazard to operations.
(Added-AFSOC) Mutual/Concurrent Use of Airspace—Participating aircraft can expect to
encounter other military aircraft scheduled to operate within the same airspace boundaries and/or
at the same altitude. When scheduled for mutual use of airspace, pilots must operate their
aircraft in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) and maintain a "see and avoid" posture for
 58                                           AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


other aircraft. AFSOC units will ensure that aircrews scheduled into mutual/concurrent use
airspace are briefed accordingly.
National Security Area (NSA)—Designated area where there is a requirement for increased
security and safety of ground facilities.
Nonrulemaking Actions—Cases relating to FAA decisions or activities affecting airspace for
which FAA does not generally issue a rule, regulation, or order. These actions include
establishing (or eliminating) FAA or military NAVAIDs as well as designating controlled firing
areas, alert areas, MOAs, warning areas, and airports provided the action of one of these items
does not impact on a mandatory rulemaking action.
Prohibited Area—Areas where over flight of a surface area is prohibited in the interest of
national security or environmental protection.
(Added-AFSOC) Real Time Airspace Use—The time airspace is actually used as opposed to
scheduled for use. When aircraft enter the respective airspace real time or actual-use time
begins. When the aircraft exit the air space, real time use ends. Real time (or actual-use time)
tracking is critical to the effective and efficient evaluation of airspace utilization. Every effort
must be made to accurately report real time airspace use.
(Added-AFSOC) Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)—Any unmanned air vehicle not piloted or
controlled from within the vehicle. RPAs may be remotely controlled from the ground or an
aircraft. A RPA must be controlled so as to remain clear of and/or avoid conflict with
disassociated/nonparticipating aircraft(see appropriate FARs and/or FAA Handbook regarding
Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS).
Restricted Area—Designated areas established by appropriate authority over which the flight of
aircraft is restricted.
Rulemaking Actions—Procedures where FAA assigns, changes, or rescinds airspace and
manages its use by rule, regulation, or order. These actions include establishing (or eliminating)
jet routes, airways, restricted areas, prohibited areas, and various classes of airspace (A, B, C,
etc).
Slow Speed Low Altitude Training Routes (SR)—Low-level training routes used for military
air operations conducted at or below 1,500 feet AGL and at an airspeed of 250 knots or less.
(Added-AFSOC) Sortie—A single flight, by one aircraft, from takeoff to landing.
(Added-AFSOC) Sortie-Operation—A sortie-operation is the use of one airspace area (MOA,
MTR, aerial refueling area, restricted area, etc.) by one aircraft. The number of sortie-operations
is used to quantify the number of uses by aircraft and to accurately measure potential
environmental impacts(e.g., noise, air quality, and safety impacts).
Special Use Airspace (SUA)—Airspace that is of a defined vertical and lateral dimension that
alerts users to areas of unusual flight hazards and separates those activities from other airspace
users to enhance safety. Certain limitations or restrictions may be placed on non-participating
aircraft.
Warning Area—Airspace of defined dimensions extending from 3 or 12 nautical miles (NM)
outward from the coast of the United States that contains activity that may be hazardous to non-
participating aircraft.

                           WGEF EVALUATION GUIDELINES

A12.1. The OPR shall evaluate proposed applications for wind energy site testing and
monitoring activities and for commercial wind energy development when proposed on or near
lands or airspace managed by the USAF (including the ANG, and the USAFR). The
development of wind turbines has increased dramatically worldwide and USAF operators will
frequently encounter their presence in real world operations. WGEF evaluation will contain the
potential impact assessment of temporary site testing placement and monitoring activities,
permanent wind energy development, and recommendations on how to minimize the impacts to
the USAF mission, as required.
A12.2. The OPR shall examine the issues below when evaluating the impacts of possible
placement of wind anemometers and other permanent energy development facilities:
   A12.2.1. Safety. Although the height of anemometers may not pose an immediate hazard,
   the site of the anemometer may eventually lead to the placement of wind turbines at the site
   that may exceed 750 feet AGL. When evaluating an anemometer proposal, the OPR should
   look at the future height of a wind turbine tower and associated impacts (e.g., power lines
   and related equipment for the operation of wind turbines). The OPR will verify with the
   proponent that the maximum height is to the tip of the blade as opposed to the hub. The
   placement of qualifying turbines shall be addressed through the FAA OE/AAA system at the
   time they propose the anemometer siting. The wind anemometers/turbines should be viewed
   in a manner similar to other obstructions, such as cell towers, oil/natural gas platforms, and
   water towers, encountered in normal air operations. When a unit receives an anemometer
   proposal, the OE/AAA process should be executed at that time. For those proposed in the
   vicinity of airfields, UFC 3-260-01, and the OE/AAA section of this AFI consulted.
   A12.2.2. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and Radar Signatures. The EMI and radar
   signatures of wind turbines can impact current and future air operations. The OPR should
   contact the Air Force Research Lab at Kirtland AFB, NM (AFRL/DEHE) at DSN 263-6083
   for further analysis. Provide the lab information on manufacturer(s) specifications (e.g.,
   height of wind structure, blade construction material, average blade revolutions per minute
   (RPM), etc.) and possible affected electronic sites.
   A12.2.3. Operational Security. Sites should be evaluated for potential impact on national
   security.

                                     STOPLIGHT CHART

A14.1. Units should assess their airspace for compatibility with wind energy development. A
successfully implemented method of illustrating land use compatibility is the ―Stoplight‖ chart
(see Figure A14.1). The compatibility will depend greatly on the type of mission being
conducted.
   A14.1.1. Red identifies land use that is incompatible for the development of wind turbines.
   An example of a red area would be when a turbine penetrates a vertical and/or lateral
   airspace boundary, adversely impacts radar system performance, Terminal Instrument
   Procedures, landing zone operations, or interferes with operations.
   A14.1.2. Yellow identifies land use that may or may not be compatible for wind turbine
   development. An example of a yellow area is an area where the unit is proposing to expand
   an existing piece of airspace for a future mission or where a turbine would leave minimum
   separation from existing flight tracks or paths. The yellow area is where the unit and
   proponent may need to perform careful evaluation and negotiation in the placement of wind
   turbines. Applying this to the airfield environment, the criteria for yellow will be based on
   specific conditions and mission needs.
   A14.1.3. Green identifies land use that is compatible for the development of wind turbines.
   An example of a green area is if the floor of a section of airspace is at least 1,000 feet above
   the proposed maximum height of a turbine. Green areas do not depict areas not required by
   the unit; rather, they specify areas where mission impact is minimal below a specified
   altitude. It should not be inferred that the area is not required as airspace or is not critical to
   airfield operations.

Figure A14.1. Stoplight Chart




Discussion. 1. Red indicates airspace with a base altitude of surface or 100 feet AGL. Any
obstacle at any height would have detrimental impact to air operations. 2. Yellow area is
proposed extension of existing airspace. An obstacle proposed in this area would need to be
 76                                           AFI13-201_AFSOCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


carefully evaluated for impact on future airspace operations. 3. Green indicates airspace with a
base altitude of 2,500 feet AGL. Obstacles up to 2,000 feet AGL will have little to no impact on
air operations (NOTE: In the unusual circumstance of an obstacle being higher than 2,000 feet
AGL but less than 2,500 feet AGL, it could be considered in a yellow’ zone). 4. The Grid pattern,
(Yellow/Green combination) indicates transitional airspace. Green is up to 750 feet AGL, but
yellow between 750 and 2,500 feet AGL. This chart is designed as a planning feature to assist in
surface evaluation of obstacles affecting airspace. It is not part of the FAA’s OE/AAA process
and does not necessarily depict the actual airspace vertical altitude dimensions (NOTE: this
example assumes no obstacle will be higher than 4,000 feet AGL). Note that to apply this type of
assessment strategy to the airfield environment, the altitudes and considerations will be different
than those described here.
A14.2. The Stoplight chart can represent a 3-D depiction of your airspace by defining the
altitudes. A selected area can contain two or more colors. For example, an area could be green up
to 750 feet AGL, yellow between 750 feet and 1000 feet AGL, and red above 1000 feet AGL.
