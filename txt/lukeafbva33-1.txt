                     PRIVACY ACT STATEMENT
                        56 FW Commander’s Staff –
                           Information Collection

AUTHORITY: Title 10 U.S.C. 8013, Secretary of the Air Force, Executive Order 9397

PURPOSE: The Social Security Number (SSN) will be used as a method of positive
identification of military personnel attending 56 FW Commander’s Call. Scanning the
Common Access Card (CAC) is an efficient, effective and reliable means of obtaining
the SSN.

ROUTINE USES: Copies of the roster will be maintained with the 56 FW
Commander’s Staff (full SSN will be removed; only the last 4 will be used). The
squadron commander will only receive the portion of the roster that pertains to their
squadron only and will be marked For Official Use Only. Information (not including
SSNs) will be disclosed to Squadron Commanders to substantiate active duty military
members that were not in attendance at any of the 56 FW Commander’s Calls.

DISCLOSURE IS VOLUNTARY: Without this information the 56 FW Staff cannot
accurately account for attendance to Commander’s Call. 56 FW Commander’s Call is a
mandatory appointment; failure to attend and provide this information can lead to
actions.
