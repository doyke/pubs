1.   Scope
     This multiservice operations publication provides tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTP) for conducting chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) avoidance. This
document presents comprehensive TTP for passive and active avoidance measures. Users of
this manual will be CBRN staff officers, CBRN noncommissioned officers (NCOs),
non-CBRN personnel performing collateral duties as an additional duty CBRN officer or
NCO, commanders and staff at the tactical through strategic levels, and civilian agencies.
2.   Purpose
     The purpose of this publication is to provide commanders, staffs, key agencies, and
service members with a key reference for planning and conducting CBRN avoidance. It
provides the tools for CBRN defense personnel to implement active and passive CBRN
avoidance measures and supports the decision-making process. It also serves as a key
source document for refining existing training support packages, training center exercises,
and service school curricula.
3.   Application

                                    INTRODUCTION 


1.   Background
     a.    The best defense against CBRN weapons is using the fundamental principles of
contamination avoidance. Avoid the hazard by deterring or preventing it from being
released in the first place; or know exactly where, what, and how much CBRN hazard is
present in the area of operations (AO) and do not enter that area unless it is vital to
mission success.
     b.    Successful contamination avoidance prevents disruption to operations and
organizations by minimizing unnecessary time in cumbersome protective postures and by
minimizing decontamination requirements. Successful avoidance may be achieved by
bypassing contamination or calculating the best time to cross contaminated areas using the
procedures described in this manual. Avoiding contamination requires the ability to
recognize the presence or absence of CBRN hazards in the air; on water, land, personnel,
equipment, and facilities; and at short and long ranges.
     c.   Surveillance and detection capabilities enable forces to recognize CBRN hazards.
The fusion of these capabilities with information from other sources yields an overall COP,
supporting decisions for specific avoidance, protection, and decontamination actions.
      d.  These surveillance and detection results also establish requirements for other
avoidance measures, such as sounding alarms, marking hazards, and warning forces. To
support commanders’ decisions on contamination avoidance implementation measures are
executed to avoid or limit exposure, such as increasing the use of shelters during CBRN
employment windows and providing key information for movement before, during, and
after CBRN attacks.
2.   Sense, Shape, Shield, and Sustain
     CBRN defense has four operational elements that serve as key capability categories.
Figure I-1, page I-2, displays the interrelationship between these four operational
elements—sense, shape, shield, and sustain. The elements interrelate to varying extents,
with shape having the most influence on the other operational elements.
     a.   Sense. Sense is the capability to continually provide updated and accurate
information about the CBRN situation at a specific time and place. Contamination
avoidance implements this element by detecting, identifying, and quantifying those CBRN
hazards in all physical states (solid, liquid, gas) with sensors, arrays, and detectors.
     b.   Shape. Shape provides the ability to characterize the CBRN hazard. The force
commander’s staff collects and assimilates information from sensors, intelligence, and
medical assets in near-real time to provide actual and potential impacts of CBRN hazards.
This information allows the commander to develop a clear understanding of the current and
predicted CBRN situation.

                          Figure I-1. CBRN Operational Elements
     c.   Shield. Shield provides the capability to shield the force from harm caused by
CBRN hazards by preventing or reducing individual and collective exposures, applying
prophylaxis to prevent or mitigate negative physiological effects, and protecting critical
equipment. Avoidance, mitigation, and active- and passive-defense measures assist the
commander with the shield of personnel and equipment.
      d.   Sustain. Sustain is the ability to conduct decontamination and medical actions
that enable the quick restoration of combat power, maintain or recover essential functions
that are free of the effects of CBRN hazards, and facilitate the return to preincident
operational capability as soon as possible.
3.    Fundamentals and Principles
      The possibility that an adversary will use CBRN weapons against the United States
and its allies continues to increase daily. If these weapons are used, our forces must be
ready to implement the principles of CBRN defense. The first of these is contamination
avoidance, which if successful, may limit the need for individual and collective protective
equipment or the need to conduct time- and labor-intensive decontamination activities. In
addition to the current arsenals of CBRN weapons systems, almost all areas of the world
have various types of factories, research facilities, pharmaceutical production lines, and
power plants that contain large quantities of materials which may be hazardous when
released into the atmosphere. Experiences with the chemical release at Bhopal, India, and
the nuclear contamination release at Chernobyl, Ukraine, demonstrate that toxic industrial
material (TIM) can be just as hazardous as military weapons. A release other than attack
(ROTA), whether intentional or due to collateral damage, presents a potential challenge for
our forces.
      a.   Fundamentals of CBRN Defense. The three fundamentals of CBRN defense are
contamination avoidance, protection, and decontamination (see Figure I-2). Executed at all
levels and coupled with an effective retaliatory response, these fundamentals will increase
the likelihood of a US victory. While avoiding contamination is always desirable, the
mission may force individuals and units to occupy or cross a contaminated area. Units can

minimize their performance degradation and limit exposure to contamination by following
the principles and procedures outlined in this manual.

                                                                 equipment, or

     b.    Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is defined as taking actions
to avoid or reduce the effects of a CBRN attack and to minimize the effects of CBRN or TIM
contamination hazards. There are active and passive measures that can be taken to avoid
contamination. Passive-defense measures include those measures taken to avoid being
targeted and hit by a weapons system. These include operational security, camouflage and
concealment, hardening positions, and the dispersion of service members and equipment.
Contamination avoidance includes the following four CBRN-specific steps:



2 February 2006   FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                     I-3
          (1)   Implement passive-defense measures.
          (2)   Warn and report CBRN or TIM events.
          (3)   Locate, identify, track, and predict CBRN or TIM hazards.
          (4)   Limit exposure to CBRN or TIM hazards.
     c.    Tenets of Contamination Avoidance. The doctrinal tenets of contamination
avoidance are sound and can be applied to all situations at all levels. The TTP of applying
contamination avoidance will vary according to mission, the type of agent encountered, and
the environmental conditions. Some TIM are not detected by standard military detectors.
For example, the TTP applied to a large, fixed facility, such as an airfield, will differ from
those selected for a mobile unit. The following list outlines some of the skills and
procedures necessary to implement contamination avoidance:
          (1)   Knowledge of potential hazards.
          (2)   Intelligence preparation of the battlespace (IPB).
          (3)   Vulnerability analysis.
          (4) Situational awareness (SA) (based on the three items listed above and the
actual data from the location of the contamination).
      d.   Fixed and Mobile Operations. Units and activities can generally be
characterized as fixed or mobile. In a similar manner, contamination within the battlespace
is confined to a specific location or is being carried across the terrain by wind. Since the
services currently have a very limited capability to perform standoff detection, most
detection will occur in close proximity to, or in the midst of, a unit. In many cases, the
warning to a unit of a potential hazard will come from another unit that has become
contaminated. At higher echelons, specialized units (CBRN reconnaissance, biological
detection) provide attack indications through the CBRNWRS. Each unit provides CBRN
information commensurate with its detection capability. The fusion of data from many
sources provides the commander with SA of CBRN contamination and its potential effect on
his scheme of maneuver.
      e.    Knowledge of Hazards. Contamination avoidance begins with the knowledge of
hazards that may be encountered. This includes the physical characteristics, field behavior,
and employment techniques that may be used. A thorough IPB is also essential to
avoidance. Understanding the threat’s CBRN capabilities and delivery systems allows the
joint force commander (JFC) to employ the assets necessary to protect the force. Because
the detectors have technical and practical limitations, they should be integrated and
networked throughout the battlespace in order to provide maximum coverage against
threats.
     f.    Principles of Avoidance. The principles of avoidance include the elements of
detecting, identifying, predicting, warning, reporting, marking, relocating, and rerouting.
           (1) Detecting. In CBRN environments, detection is the act of locating CBRN
hazards by using detectors or monitoring and survey teams. The implications of detection
include the following:
                (a) Warning. Standoff detection provides the warning of an approaching
cloud (not a specific chemical-biological [CB] agent) in sufficient time to implement
protective measures before an agent contamination occurs.


I-4              FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56 2 February 2006
                (b) Treatment (Medical Surveillance [MEDSURV]). Detection for
treatment focuses on identifying the type of agent dispersed in an attack so that the best
possible treatment can be rendered as early as possible.
                 (c) Verification (Reconnoitering and Monitoring). Detection for
verification provides critical information to support decisions regarding national strategic
direction and integration.
                (d) Surface Contamination (Monitoring). Detection for surface
contamination assists the commander with their decision making process. The results of
monitoring will allow them to make decisions, such as whether decontamination is
necessary or whether bypass routes are needed.
                (e) Unmasking (Dewarning). Detection for unmasking is a means of
detecting the reduction of contamination to acceptable levels. A comparison of methods and
results from the earlier detection of an agent will be an important aspect of determining
when to unmask.
           (2) Identifying. Identification allows commanders to take the measures
required for protection and treatment. Follow-on surveys and sampling can then be used
for the verification.
           (3) Predicting. CBRN personnel prepare hazard predictions for CBRN attacks,
as the attack is not confined to the area directly attacked. The resulting aerosol or fallout
travels with the wind and can cover a large area downwind of the attack area. To prevent
casualties, units quickly estimate the possible hazard area and warn units within that area.
The estimates of the hazard areas are only approximations. Terrain, weather, and delivery
system variations modify the hazard area. In addition, the methods used to predict the
downwind hazard are “safe-sided” for personnel safety. This ensures that the hazard
should be within the predicted area, giving units in the area time to take appropriate
precautions.
          (4) Warning and Reporting. Warning and reporting informs US forces, allies,
and friendly forces of the impending or actual use of CBRN weapons.
         (5) Marking. Contamination is marked to warn friendly personnel. Units or
CBRN reconnaissance teams mark all likely entry points into the area and report
contamination to higher headquarters (HQ).
            (6) Relocating and Rerouting. Relocation may be an option, depending on the
tactical situation and the mission. This is a viable option for units that are mobile, but is
not valid for fixed sites, ports, and airfields.
4.   Vulnerability Reduction
      Active measures prevent the enemy from using CBRN weapons; passive measures
increase survivability. Individual and unit collective measures are only discussed briefly
here. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and
Chemical (NBC) Protection for detailed information.
     a.   Active Measures. Active measures are those measures taken to find and destroy
munitions and delivery systems. The destruction of the delivery systems and munitions is
the best method of reducing the chances of being attacked. The destruction of stockpiles of
CBRN munitions and production facilities is usually beyond the capabilities of lower-level



2 February 2006   FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                 I-5
commanders. Strategic levels of command will have the responsibility and the assets to
find and destroy these targets. Operational and tactical level commanders do not have the
capability to locate and destroy stockpiles or production facilities, but they do have the
capability to find and destroy delivery systems.
     b.   Passive Measures. It may not be possible to destroy all threat CBRN munitions
and delivery systems; units must always take precautions to avoid being targeted and to
reduce the effects of an attack if one does occur. These are passive measures. All units
must use passive measures as part of normal operations to reduce the effects of operating
under CBRN conditions. These measures include—
            (1) Planning Ahead. Commanders must take the time to carefully plan courses
of action (COAs) and allow for the additional time requirement. This is commonly referred
to as war-gaming. A bad decision could cause the unit to become contaminated or suffer
casualties. See Appendix A for preattack checklists.
          (2) Avoiding Detection. Avoiding detection is the best way to prevent CB
attacks. Do this by employing operations security (OPSEC) measures. These include
camouflage, light discipline and, especially, signal security. Active and passive measures
must be used to prevent the enemy from gaining target information.
          (3) Providing Warning. If the unit is unable to avoid CBRN attacks, the early
warning of battlefield hazards is very important. The CBRNWRS notifies units that
adjacent units have been attacked or that a downwind hazard is present.
          (4) Seeking Protection. Seek protection in hardened facilities or bunkers. If
they are not available, natural terrain may provide shelter from some effects of CBRN
weapons. However, ditches, ravines, and natural depressions allow the accumulation of
chemical agents. Heavy forests and jungles protect against liquid chemical agents, but
vapor hazards will increase.
            (5) Dispersing Assets. Dispersion must reduce vulnerability, but not hinder
operations or prevent the unit from concentrating when necessary. Supplies (especially
food; petroleum, oil, and lubricants [POL]; and ammunition) must be dispersed so that they
will not all be destroyed at once. The degree of acceptable dispersion will depend on the
mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops available and civilian (METT-TC)
considerations.
NOTE: The USMC and joint doctrine use the term mission, enemy, terrain and
weather, troops and support available—time available (METT-T). Civilian
considerations are inherently measured within the context of this acronym.
          (6) Remaining Mobile. Mobility gives the commander the best chance for
avoidance. Constant movement prevents the enemy from pinpointing locations and
accurately employing CBRN weapons.
           (7) Covering Supplies and Equipment. Store supplies and equipment under
cover to prevent contamination.

5.   Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Battle Management
      Future requirements for CBRN defense must contribute to the achievement of full
force protection (FP) as envisioned by Joint Vision 2020 (see Figure I-3). Currently, our
ability allows us to incorporate existing sensors into a manual system with “man-in-the
loop.” Future artificial intelligence applications will reduce, but not eliminate, human
judgment requirements. Combining service capabilities, coalition partners, and available
civil defense assets into a standardized warning and reporting system provides the best
opportunity to produce CBRN awareness. The sensors collect data, the data is turned into
information by using the CBRN report formats, the information is processed into knowledge
by experts who provide hazard predictions and contamination overlays, and the knowledge
is used by commanders as the basis of understanding for subsequent planning and order
development. CBRN battle management (BM) requires the consideration of risks
associated with an adversary CBRN employment and the friendly CBRN defense actions.
It includes the proper employment of the CBRNWRS and applies principles of IM to the
CBRN defense challenges facing the command.

 “The potential of such asymmetric approaches is perhaps the most serious danger the United States faces
 in the immediate future—and this danger includes long-range ballistic missiles and other direct threats to
 US citizens and territory. The asymmetric methods and objectives of an adversary are often far more
 important than the relative technological imbalance, and the psychological impact of an attack might far
 outweigh the actual physical damage inflicted. An adversary may pursue an asymmetric advantage on the
 tactical, operational, or strategic level by identifying key vulnerabilities and devising asymmetric concepts
 and capabilities to strike or exploit them. To complicate matters, our adversaries may pursue a
 combination of asymmetries, or the United States may face a number of adversaries who, in combination,
 create an asymmetric threat. These asymmetric threats are dynamic and subject to change, and the US
 Armed Forces must maintain the capabilities necessary to deter, defend against, and defeat any adversary
 who chooses such an approach. To meet the challenges of the strategic environment in 2020, the joint
 force must be able to achieve full spectrum dominance.”

                             Figure I-3. Excerpt From Joint Vision 2020
     a.    CBRNWRS. The CBRNWRS provides data and information to support the
CBRN BM process. Input and output from the CBRNWRS provides a means to inform
friendly units of possible contamination. For the CBRNWRS to be effective, units send
information on first use by the fastest communications means available. For example, first-
use reports require FLASH precedence. Units send subsequent information by any reliable
communications means.
      b.   CBRN IM. CBRN IM (see Figure I-4, page I-8) refers to the processes a
commander uses to obtain, manipulate, direct, and control information. IM includes all
processes involved in the creation, collection, control, dissemination, storage, and retrieval
of information. CBRN SA of the operations environment allows the commander to
anticipate future conditions and accurately assesses risks. Graphic depictions of CBRN
hazard estimates/plots with text files (e.g., messages, reports) are very useful versus sole
reliance on map boards and overlays. The vertical and horizontal exchange of CBRN-
related information keeps different commands and staff personnel informed. The CBRN
staff determines the need for specific types of CBRN information (i.e., the when and where
of the CBRN attack). Positioning the required information at its anticipated points of need
speeds the flow and reduces demands on communications systems. The information
received from sensor networks also helps to provide an assessment of the current situation
by detecting and identifying CBRN hazards in air, on water, or on land. It detects and

identifies CBRN hazards affecting personnel, equipment, or facilities and the physical state
of such hazards (gas, liquid, or solid). The detection of hazards is a key enabler and
provides a visualization of the CBRN environment. This visualization helps to develop a
clear understanding of the current and predicted CBRN situation, envision the end state
(mission accomplishment without CBRN casualties and operating tempo [OPTEMPO]
degradation), and anticipate the sequence that moves the force from its current state to the
desired end state. The commander’s SA and risk assessment leads to decisions to
implement measures to protect the force and maintain an advantage in the OPTEMPO
while preventing casualties under CBRN conditions by reducing the threat, reducing
operational vulnerability, and avoiding contamination.

          (1) Actions. The CBRN staff translates all source information into an
understanding of the CBRN threat and the operational environment for CBRN defense
actions. This process requires—
               •    Timely conduct to assess vulnerability.
               •    Specific COAs for reducing vulnerability and countering specific threats.




I-8                  FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56 2 February 2006
            •     CBRN warning and reporting on potential and actual CBRN attacks to
facilitate risk assessments and actions and to minimize the short- and long-term health
effects of toxic exposures.
          (2)     Enablers. To maintain SA, units conduct CBRN IM by—
          •       Obtaining the relevant battlespace data.
          •       Processing data into relevant information.
          •       Gaining knowledge by determining the impact of the information on
operations.
          •    Developing a plan based on the knowledge of the situation (knowing what
has occurred and what to do about it).
          •       Supporting CBRN defense execution through orders and risk management.
          •       Maintaining SA with man-in-the-loop assessment.
           (3) Data. The CBRN staff focuses on knowing what data is relevant,
determining what data can be collected prior to events, and developing a data collection
plan to obtain other data.
          (4) Information. The CBRN staff processes data into operationally significant
information and develops a collection plan to obtain additional data if information is
incomplete.
           (5) Knowledge. The CBRN staff uses their military decision-making process to
translate information into knowledge. It estimates and assesses hazards to develop
possible COAs.
           (6) Understanding. Understanding requires SA; the commander uses this
awareness to communicate intent and issue orders that mitigate risk through the
application of various CBRN defense measures.
6. Commander and Staff Interactions in Meeting Chemical, Biological,
Radiological, and Nuclear Defense Challenges
      a.   CBRN defense challenges call for close commander and staff interactions.
Operations in CBRN environments demand close attention to technical details by CBRN
staff experts and the integration of CBRN defense knowledge into the organization plans
and actions. Technical experts must be fully familiar with the organization mission and
capabilities and the current situation so that their assessments and recommendations
provide meaningful options for action by the commander.
      b.    In addition to applying the principles of CBRN defense and exercising CBRN BM
capabilities in the most effective manner, CBRN staff experts must be aware of the military
and civilian environments in which the organization operations are unfolding. While the
primary responsibility of the commander and the military organization as a whole is to
accomplish the mission and care for the lives and welfare of individuals in uniform, the
military exists in an interdependent mode with its surrounding community. Therefore, due
to consideration in risk assessments, other recommendations and plans must be given to
the broader environment, including the civilian populace, in order to make militarily
effective plans that are not frustrated by adversary damage inflicted on the civilian
community. See Appendix B for information on CBRN cells.


2 February 2006   FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56               I-9
7.     Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Operations
       CBRN operations require detailed planning to be successful.
       a.   CBRN Defense Planning and Considerations.
          (1) Operational Implications. At the operational level, the analysis of the
battlespace environment should concentrate on—
       •    The capability of transportation networks to support movement.
       •    Logistic support to CBRN weapons.
       •    Zones of entry into and through the operational area and area of interest.
     •     The impact of large geographic features (such as mountains, large forests,
deserts, and archipelagos) on military operations.
       •    Seasonal climatic efforts on CBRN weapons effects.
CBRN defense planning and analysis assists the commander and staff in visualizing and
assessing the full spectrum of adversary offensive CBRN weapons capabilities across all
dimensions of the battlespace. The following is a list of items to be considered when
planning CBRN defense:
                 (a) Intelligence Collection, Analysis, and Production. Assessments should
identify threat agents and weapons and industrial sites containing TIM that would present
a hazard to deployed forces if sabotaged or destroyed.
                 (b) SA. Ensure that the CBRNWRS is operational as quickly as possible
after entry into a theater. Assets such as the Biological Integrated Detection System
(BIDS) should be deployed to monitor high-value assets. Detection systems for CBRN
agents should be deployed and networked to provide a warning of attack.
               (c) Common Planning, Training, and Equipment Standards. Gaps in the
CBRN defense capabilities of multinational forces are identified to promote effectiveness in
planning and operations.
                (d) Medical CBRN Defense. Medical CBRN defense is integrated into the
planning process to support unit readiness. See Appendix C for detailed information on
radiological exposure
                  (e) Protection of the Joint Rear Area and Theater Sustainment
Capabilities. A successful adversary CBRN attack on an essential port of debarkation or
other critical logistics facility can degrade joint-force OPTEMPO and force generation
capabilities.
                (f) Logistics Burden of CBRN Attacks. The resupply of protective
clothing, equipment, repair parts, medical supplies (antidotes and antibiotics), and other
resources must be factored into computation of resource requirements.
               (g) In-Theater, Active-Defense Systems. Planners should consider
deployment configurations and concepts of operations that maximize the use of active-
defense systems.
               (h) Preplanning for Attack Operations. Attack operations are prioritized
and may be a high strategic or national priority at any point in a crisis, during the



I-10              FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56 2 February 2006
transition to war, or during hostilities as a means to deny an adversary the capability to
produce, store, transport, or employ CBRN weapons.
               (i) Effects of CBRN Attacks on Command, Control, Communications,
Computers, and Intelligence (C4I). Limitations will result from the requirement to operate
in CBRN protective equipment, from the contamination of equipment, and from the effects
of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) on electrical and electronic equipment.
                 (j) Capabilities and Limitations of Multinational Forces. The planning
process should consider the implications and feasibility of diverting US assets and
capabilities to support host nations (HNs) and other multinational members in meeting
common operational objectives.
                (k) In-Theater Consequence Management (CM). Plans for in-theater CM
include the mitigation and management of the effects of CBRN attacks within a theater of
operations (see Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological,
and Chemical Aspects of Consequence Management).
            (2) Tactical Implications. At the tactical level, the size and location of
battlespace are influenced by the physical location of adversary land, air, naval, space, and
other forces that could pose a direct threat to the security of the friendly force or the success
of its mission. The extent to which the effects of the battlespace environment are analyzed
at the tactical level is largely dependent on the mission and planning time available. At a
minimum, tactical level forces should analyze the battlespace environment in terms of
military objectives, avenues of approach, and the effects of a CBRN environment on
personnel, military operations, weapons systems, and force mobility. CBRN defense at the
tactical level will be based on, and result in, a higher degree of detail than would be
necessary at higher levels of military operations.
           (3) Homeland Defense Implications. A challenge for commanders conducting
CM operations is the requirement to adequately protect personnel, and materiel from a
CBRN incident. There is a need for a response capability to save lives, contain an incident,
and recover to a point that permits operations to resume. Confronting this challenge
requires a comprehensive and integrated approach from threat mitigation to incident
response and recovery. Military units develop deliberate plans to respond to CBRN attacks
within their assigned regions. Response plans should be updated regularly and coordinated
with the appropriate response agencies in the region. Plans should focus on the
unanticipated event and potential terrorist targets, such as special events, high-profile
buildings, medical and scientific research centers, and air and rail transportation
platforms. Response elements should also prioritize planning efforts in coordination with
the other response agencies within their region. Planning efforts should be prioritized based
on the most likely threats.
     b.    Chemical Defense Planning and Considerations. (See Appendixes D and E.)
           (1) Operational Implications. Chemical warfare (CW) can be used to
contaminate ground and resources with persistent chemical hazards. Nonpersistent vapor
hazards and the vapor from persistent contamination can spread downwind and pose a
hazard over a significant portion of the AOs given the right meteorological (MET)
conditions. Commanders will need to consider the avoidance and evacuation of hazard
areas. CW protection will be needed for forces that remain in the area. Operational
capability and tempo are likely to be degraded because of the need for the force to adopt



2 February 2006   FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                  I-11
CBRN defense detection, warning, protection, and control measures. Chemical detection,
identification, protection, and decontamination will put a burden on the theater logistics
system.
          (2) Tactical Implications. Forces remaining in or near CW hazard areas will
probably need to remain in CBRN protection until the commander determines that the
personnel should reduce their mission-oriented protective posture (MOPP) level. This can
cause some loss of OPTEMPO due to the fact that it may—
               (a) Cause personnel to work in individual protective equipment (IPE),
degrading performance, increasing fatigue, and possibly lowering force cohesion and
morale.
                 (b) Reduce the overall speed, cohesion, and freedom of movement of forces
in the local area because of contaminated areas and assets.
                (c) Restrict the local use of ground and operational assets, cause resource-
intensive decontamination of key assets, and distort the logistics chain.
           (3) Homeland Defense Implications. The use of chemical agents can cause
psychological and physiological effects and also cause contamination or damage that will
restrict the use of facilities, equipment, or supplies. Fear and panic are the normal
reactions to discussions of chemical agents, and most civilian authorities will need
considerable assistance in locating, containing, and recovering from a chemical incident.
       c.   Biological Defense Planning and Considerations. (See Appendix F.)
           (1) Operational Implications. The potential impact of biological warfare (BW)
attacks at the operational level can be wide-ranging and significant, particularly if the
detection and identification of an attack proves difficult and countermeasures are difficult
to implement. Large numbers of casualties can reduce the operational capability of the joint
force, reduce morale, and divert medical and logistics resources from current operations.
When combined, these factors may reduce OPTEMPO.
           (2) Tactical Implications. There will be some loss of operational capability by
those forces remaining in or near BW hazard areas. The following factors may hinder
personnel effectiveness:
                 (a)   Remaining in CBRN protection for long periods of time.
               (b) Maintaining frequent and regular health monitoring of personnel,
increased standards of hygiene, and protection of rations and water.
                 (c)   Avoiding the use of contaminated areas and assets.
                 (d)   Decontaminating key assets.
           (3) Homeland Defense Implications. One of the dangers of biological weapons
is amplified by the fact that exposure to the agents would probably not be known until
symptoms appear (sentinel casualty). Personal protection generally consists of individual
protection and medical measures, such as immunization or the application of some other
postincident medical treatment (antibiotics). Biological-agent dissemination could be
accomplished by measures such as aerosol dissemination, food or water contamination, and
vector release. Biological agents can be produced in the laboratory or purchased from a
number of medical-research firms. For planning purposes, individual protection at any
suspected biological incident is of the utmost importance. Mobile laboratories can process


I-12              FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56 2 February 2006
samples and identify pathogens. Early identification is essential in order to begin
treatment protocols.
    d.   Nuclear and Radiological Defense Planning and Considerations. (See
Appendixes G and H.)
            (1) Operational Implications. The devastation resulting from a nuclear burst
is likely to require that a significant portion of the joint force assets be deployed to assist in
recovery in the area of the nuclear burst. The fallout from the nuclear detonation will cover
a portion of the joint operational area, and measures to control the contamination and
exposure of all personnel in the area will be needed. The operational capability of the joint
force is likely to be degraded for a considerable period. The potential for mass casualties in
the local civilian population is also likely to place a burden on the operational command and
staff.
            (2) Tactical Implications. In the area of a nuclear detonation, the operational
capability of the joint force will be seriously degraded. Degradation will be caused by the
loss of personnel, equipment, and resources; and the need to rescue and treat injured
personnel and fight possible fires will require a significant expenditure of resources. The
blocking of transportation routes and mobility corridors by debris and trees may also
degrade recovery. There will also be a need to deploy assets to assist other agencies and the
HN. The immediate area of the nuclear detonation is likely to be highly contaminated, and
movement, except to save life, will be severely limited. Fallout and induced radiation
patterns will require that units follow the operational exposure guidelines in Appendix C.
            (3) Homeland Defense Implications. While the detonation of a nuclear device
is perhaps the least likely scenario for a terrorist incident, it has the potential to cause the
greatest damage in terms of destruction and psychological damage (fear and panic). The
effects of a nuclear detonation include thermal, blast, and nuclear radiation. Even for a
small nuclear device, the number of casualties from blast, thermal, and initial nuclear
radiation could number in the hundreds. The presence of an induced radiation pattern and
downwind fallout will require a large number of monitors using radiac equipment and
might require the evacuation of a large number of people until the radiation decays to a
safe level.
     e.    Radiological Weapons Defense Planning and Considerations. (See Appendixes G
and H.)
            (1) Operational Implications. Radiological warfare can be used to contaminate
ground and resources with radioactive hazards. Commanders will need to consider the
avoidance and evacuation of the hazard areas, particularly during military operations other
than war (MOOTW). Radiological protection will be needed for forces that remain in the
area. Operational capability and tempo are likely to be degraded because of the need for
the joint force to adopt CBRN defense detection, warning, protection, and control measures.
           (2) Tactical Implications. There will be some loss of operational capability by
those forces remaining in or near radiological hazard areas. This will be caused by the need
to—
                  (a)   Remain in CBRN protection for long periods of time.
                (b) Manage exposure to radioactive hazard and rotate personnel,
particularly during MOOTW.



2 February 2006    FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                  I-13
                 (c)   Avoid the use of contaminated routes, areas, and assets.
                 (d)   Decontaminate key assets.
             (3) Homeland Defense Implications. A terrorist could wrap an improvised
explosive device (IED) with radiological materials to create an incident in which the initial
explosion may kill or injure persons in the immediate vicinity of the device. Following the
incident, the possible ingestion and inhalation of radioactive particles would also pose a
health risk. Simple radiological dispersal is an act intended to spread radioactive material
not involving an explosive device. A terrorist need only secure a supply of radiological
material (e.g., gamma, beta, or alpha emitters) from a medical laboratory, industrial
facility, or other site and disperse the material.
       f.   ROTA and TIM Defense Planning and Considerations. (See Appendix H.)
             (1) Operational Implications. The sites of significant TIM facilities in the joint
operations area need to be plotted and, whenever and wherever possible, avoided during
operations. Contingency plans need to be made with the HN to control and contain the
hazards if TIM facilities are damaged. Whatever the circumstances of a TIM release, the
impact on military capability will need to be assessed. A large-scale release from TIM
facilities, particularly if there are also large fires, has the potential to spread toxic aerosols
and smoke across a significant percentage of the operational area. Such hazards will need
to be avoided by the joint force or protection will be needed, particularly during MOOTW.
This is likely to restrict the freedom of action of the joint force and may degrade
OPTEMPO. Damage to nuclear facilities, even without a breach to core containment, may
also spread radioactive aerosols and smoke. In addition, if threat CBRN weapon production
or storage sites are targeted and hit, downwind hazard prediction should be accomplished
to determine if there is any threat to the force or HN personnel.
            (2) Tactical Implications. Forces that remain in the area will probably need to
adopt protection. Because of the nature of the TIM, countermeasures may not be within
the CBRN defense capability of the joint force. In this case, a specialist in the field of
hazardous materials (HAZMAT) management will be needed from the HN or outside the
theater. If conflict takes place in the area of TIM storage facilities, the risk of collateral
damage and the release of TIM must be assessed. Unused industrial sites with hardstands
and warehouses often provide ideal logistics facilities, but need to be checked for all forms
of TIM before use. Particular note of TIM needs to be taken when accommodations for
personnel are selected.
           (3) Homeland Defense Implications. TIM are substances that may create signs
and symptoms similar to CBRN exposure. These materials are found throughout the
normal transaction of daily business in the United States and are transported on our
railways, roadways, and waterways. They may or may not be precursors to CBRN agents.
Most of the materials contain volatile organic compounds, which are materials that contain
hydrocarbons and possibly other hazardous elements. They may be naturally occurring or
man-made and may evaporate easily based on agent characteristics. Testing has proven
that extended exposure may lead to debilitating injury. Some are carcinogenic, such as
benzene, or mutagenic, such as hexane (nervous system disorder). Technological
innovations and the widening proliferation of CBRN hardware and scientific expertise
increase the likelihood that states, nonstate actors, or transnational groups could threaten
the US homeland and population directly and, in times of conflict, deny US access to critical
overseas and domestic infrastructures. Terrorism remains one of the deadliest and most


I-14              FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56 2 February 2006
persistent threats to US security. The motives, perpetrators, and methods of terrorist
groups are evolving in ways that complicate analysis, collection, and counteraction and
require the ability to respond flexibly and quickly. Sophisticated detection, analytical, and
protective equipment is required to detect and identify the TIM and the special protective
equipment that may be needed.

1.   Background
      a.   CBRN avoidance measures can consist of passive measures as described in
Chapter I. However, the reporting of critical information will support time-sensitive
decisions to warn and protect our forces. The effective and efficient processing of CBRN
information will support the unit mission and the commander’s FP decision making.
Timely CBRN IM is built on integrating NBC report input into the command and staff
COP.
      b.   A CBRN COP provides the commander and his forces with information that is
accurate, timely, usable, precise, and reliable. As defined in Joint Publication (JP) 1-02,
COP is a single identical display of relevant information shared by more than one
command. A COP facilitates collaborative CBRN planning and assists all echelons to
achieve SA. While the COP is intended to support the unit mission, the CBRN staff will
display information specifically designed to support their operations (e.g., NBC reports,
hazard predictions). The key consideration is that the information must be organized and
easily understood. The CBRN staff supports the preparation of the COP through the
following:
     •     Identifying information requirements (e.g., adversary CBRN capabilities,
potential time and place of attacks).
     •    Collecting and processing information (e.g., collection, analysis, and
dissemination of NBC reports).
      •   Providing information to build the COP and displays (e.g., hazard overlays, areas
of contamination).
     •     Developing understanding (e.g., supporting the commander’s decision-making
process to take avoidance or protective measures).
2. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Common Operational Picture
Functions
    There are four representative functions that support CBRN COP operations. They
are—
     a.    Detection. Detection is the act of locating CBRN hazards by the use of CBRN
detectors or monitoring and/or survey teams.
     b.  Identification. Identification is the process of determining the benign or
hazardous character of an unknown detected substance.
     c.    Contamination Marking. Contamination marking is used to provide warning to
friendly forces of the presence of contamination.
     d.   Warning and Reporting. The warning and reporting of a CBRN attack is done
using the CBRNWRS.

3. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Information Management

     CBRN IM is providing quality information to the right person at the right time in a
usable form to facilitate understanding and decision making. CBRN IM uses the
CBRNWRS as a tool to provide relevant, precise, accurate, timely, usable, and complete
information.
NOTE: An automated version of the CBRNWRS (joint warning and reporting
network [JWARN]) is currently being integrated into existing C4I systems in
order to collect, process, store, protect, display, and disseminate CBRN
information.
    a.     CBRN Processes. CBRN IM supports the commander in three main areas:
achieving SA/understanding, making decisions, and communicating execution information
to implement those decisions. CBRN IM is cyclical in nature and has four basic steps
(Figure II-1).

           (1) Identify Information Requirements. Information requirements are the
criteria that must be known about the battlespace to enable mission accomplishment.
Information requirements such as MET data; friendly unit locations; enemy CBRN
capabilities; the likelihood of CBRN weapons use; and where, how, and what CBRN
materials may have already been employed against friendly forces will all have a direct
impact on information requirements.



II-2                       FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56 2 February 2006
           (2) Collect and Process Information. The process continues with the collecting
and processing of information to fulfill information requirements. The receipt of NBC1 or
NBC4 reports will require processing in accordance with Appendixes E through H and will
directly contribute to fulfilling and identifying information requirements.
                (a) Collect. Obtain information on a CBRN attack from the NBC1 and
NBC4 reports in any manner, including direct observation or other reconnaissance and
surveillance (R&S) means.
                (b) Process. Discern the meaning of the data; and filter, format, compile,
organize, correlate, plot, and evaluate the CBRN information.
                (c) Store. Retain the CBRN information in any form for orderly, timely
retrieval and documentation until needed.
               (d) Protect. Take measures to ensure the availability of information and
information systems.
                (e) Display. Represent the CBRN information in a usable, easily
understood audio or visual form tailored to the needs of the user. The display conveys the
COP for decision making and exercising C2 functions. Historically, the display of CBRN
information has taken the form of formatted charts, written reports, verbal narrative
reports, and graphic map displays.
                (f) Disseminate. Communicate the evaluated information (such as
NBC2, NBC3, or NBC5 reports), and coordinate the procedures to disseminate the
applicable information to be incorporated into the standard operating procedure (SOP).
                (g) Dispose. Take action on inactive records. These include destroying
and archiving information.
           (3) Provide Information to Build a COP/Display. CBRN information that is
accurate, timely, usable, complete, precise, and reliable is used to build a COP. COP is a
single, identical display of information shared by more than one command. CBRN
information contributes to the COP. The impact of a CBRN attack can affect more than one
command. Each command affected requires relevant information on the CBRN attack (e.g.,
when, where, impact).
           (4) Develop an Understanding. Awareness is achieved by the provided
information, but it takes an understanding of the information to make prompt, correct
decisions (such as changing a route to avoid contamination or adjusting the MOPP level).
     b.   CBRN IM Activities. The CBRN IM includes seven basic activities—collecting,
processing, storing, protecting, displaying, disseminating, and disposing of the information.
     c.   CBRN IM Capabilities. The capability to receive and report CBRN attack
information varies from command to command. The CBRN staff makes an assessment of
the capability that exists within their command. Capabilities may range from detectors
and alarms that are not integrated to fully integrated sensors at selected locations.
           (1) Currently, many CBRN-agent detector and alarm arrays operate as
independent units. When a CBRN attack is detected, only those personnel in the
immediate vicinity hear the alarm. Adjacent units need to be notified by radio, wire
communications, or audible or verbal means. CBRN calculations and computations in
support of CBRN hazard prediction are often done manually.


2 February 2006   FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                II-3
           (2) To assist commanders and improve and automate the information
gathering and sharing process, several government off-the-shelf (GOTS) and commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) systems have been developed and are in use throughout the US
military (see Chapter III for more information).
4.     Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Information Flow Strategy
       The effective flow of information is paramount to CBRN defense operations.
      a.    The CBRN IM procedures must provide for the rapid vertical and horizontal flow
of information. Traditional staff arrangements have determined that the flow of CBRN
information should logically flow to the CBRN cells. However, it should not form a firewall
to the exchange of CBRN information with the other staff elements (e.g., operations,
intelligence, and logistics) or commands. Optimum information flow within a HQ requires
speed and clarity of transfer, without creating fragmented or useless information. The
effective flow of CBRN information requires the information to be—
     •     Positioned properly. Positioning the required information at its anticipated
points of need speeds the flow (e.g., using public folders or web pages to post the required
CBRN information, such as MET reports).
     •     Mobile. Information flow must be immediately adjusted to support the vertical
and lateral flow of information between adjacent forces (e.g., collaborative planning system
on the integration of CBRN R&S assets).
     •     Accessible. All levels of command must be able to pull the information they need
to support concurrent or parallel planning and mission execution (e.g., graphic depiction of
CBRN forces in a COP).
      •     Fused. Information is received from many sources, in many mediums, and in
different formats. It is blended into an accurate summary (e.g., a CBRN threat assessment
disseminated in graphic form on an automated COP system).
       b.      The information flow provides input for the commander’s decision support
matrix (DSM). The DSM identifies key decisions, expected events, and planned friendly
actions that the commander expects to make during the next stage or phase of the
operation. The DSM links information to key CBRN decisions. The CBRN staff provides
input to help develop a DSM during the planning process. The DSM identifies the
commander’s critical information requirement (CCIR) needed to make decisions and
achieve the desired results. (For more information on DSMs refer to Marine Corps
Warfighting Publication [MCWP] 3-40.2)
     c.    Implementing the CBRN information flow strategy provides for the required
input for the decision-making process. The CBRN staff performs the following
representative functions that furnish information to support the COP and the
decision-making process:
      •     Collect and analyze sensor inputs (e.g., detector data, detector alarms, medical
alerts).
       •    Maintain information on the status of CBRN networked sensor grids.
       •    Format and forward NBC reports to facilitate the warning of personnel.




II-4              FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56 2 February 2006
    •     Disseminate NBC reports and detector data over service tactical communication
networks.
      •    Conduct planning, training and certifying of war fighters to help ensure that
deployed and/or fielded (developmental) CBRN detectors are interoperable with the
warning and reporting system. If integrated detectors are not used, ensure that personnel
are trained in manual report procedures.
     •   Generate and display scalable hazard overlays (e.g., plots) resulting from CBRN
and TIM hazards.
     •    Provide hazard prediction analysis capabilities, perform CBRN and TIM risk
assessments, and provide situation reports (SITREPs) in support of CBRN
reconnaissance/survey plans and decontamination plans.
    •   Create CBRN annexes to operation plans (OPLANs), operation orders
(OPORDs), and fragmentary orders (FRAGORDs).
      •    Store, modify, retrieve, display, archive, and transfer data on weather, terrain,
unit locations, intelligence, locations of attacks, sources (suspected and actual) of attacks,
and CBRN or TIM hazards. This archived data is needed for event reconstruction in the
postattack phase. Weather, terrain, unit location, etc., information is required for input to
the basic hazard prediction analysis capability.
     •    Provide hazard estimated times of arrival and times of departure to units near a
hazard area.
    •    Maintain information on the locations of assigned (remote, direct, and
networked) detectors.
     •     Maintain unit CBRN information status, radiation exposure status (RES) for
reporting units, and operational status and expected changes for supporting CBRN units.
Monitoring CBRN unit status facilitates the decision process and risk assessment, and
provides current and expected unit status for the support of CBRN defense missions.
      •    Provide recommendations on dewarning via manual voice or automatic means to
affected units within and outside the area of concern.
      •    Provide input, as required, on detailed characteristics of CBRN agents, their
delivery means, their symptoms (e.g., human effects), and other data required for adequate
risk assessment.
     •    Provide basic hazard predictions of CBRN agents and TIM to assist in the
preparation of vulnerability assessments.
     •     Provide a man-in-the-loop filtering capability at the operator level to validate
CBRN detections, reduce the likelihood of being falsely warned, and reduce information
overload for single and multiple attacks.
     •     Log and archive CBRN report, detector, and sensor inputs.
     •     Receive and accept the input of intelligence data from tactical, operational, and
strategic sources; predicted intercepts of theater air and missile (TAM) data from air
defense radar systems and defense C2 systems; and other C4I and R&S inputs.

     •    Receive and accept meteorology and oceanography data from tactical,
operational, and strategic sources.
5.     Common Operational Picture Management
     Maintaining the COP ensures that US forces can make informed CBRN defense
decisions.
    a.   Information Inputs. CBRN data feeds into the COP and can be automated or
manual. CBRN IM input may include the following:
          (1) Friendly CBRN air, maritime, and ground force tracks/locations within the
operational area.
          (2) Enemy air, maritime, and ground force CBRN capabilities within the
operational area.
           (3)   CBRN operational overlays.
           (4)   MET and terrain overlays.
           (5)   CBRN-related nongovernmental organization products.
           (6)   Any other information or graphic displays required.
      b.   Standardization. CBRN information requirements are often predictable. The
staff can position information at its anticipated points of need to speed information flow and
reduce the demands on communications systems. One method is establishing a standard
reports matrix (Table II-1) to meet recurring information requirements. It provides a brief
description of the report, the sender, the receiver, and when and how to transmit the report.
The matrix should reflect the following information:
       •   Report title: Report title or type of information provided.
     •     Submitted by: The component or agency normally responsible for submitting the
report.
     •    Submitted as of: Close-out time for recurring reports. This should be no more
than 1 hour before the arrive-not-later-than (NLT) time.
       •   Arrive NLT: Time to post the report for joint task force review.
       •   Transmission type: System used (e.g., e-mail or defense message system).
     •     Precedence: The precedence to use when notifying the joint task force that the
report is available (not applicable to some notification methods).
       •   Addressee: Who the report goes to.
       •   Info to: Additional addresses.

       c.      CBRN Information Network Applications.
           (1) Networking technologies are expanding the options available for managing
the flow of CBRN-related information. A collaborative environment for sharing CBRN-
related information can be achieved using tools such as web pages, public folders, and e-
mail. An intranet infrastructure for HQ may differ from one HQ to another, but the
concepts are generally the same. A HQ intranet is a communications network in which
access to published information is restricted.
                (a) Web sites and portals. A well-organized Web site assembles,
organizes, and presents vital CBRN information in a timely manner. The CBRN staff may
develop and maintain their own Web pages for the site. CBRN information on these Web
pages could include important updates, status reports, common staff products, and current
activities.
                (b) E-mail. E-mail is a highly effective means to communicate CBRN
information, which would provide rapid dissemination of time-critical information within
the HQ. The CBRN staff should consider establishing functional versus individual
accounts to avoid an unnecessary e-mail overload. This helps prevent a message backlog
for personnel not on shift. Additionally, the use of a precedence system within an e-mail
identifies the messages requiring timely handling and review.

                (c) Shared disk drives and folders are other means that allow common
access to information. Shared drive folder names may be topical or use the same titles as
those shown in the file plan drive. See Table II-2 for a sample of shared message folders.

     CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR 

             WARNING AND REPORTING SYSTEM 


1.   Background
      The collection, evaluation, and exchange of information on CBRN incidents are
extremely important parts of avoidance. Chapter I provided a CBRN avoidance overview
and describe how it fits into the overall CBRN defense concept of operations. Chapter II
provided a CBRN COP and CBRN IM overview. The CBRNWRS is a CBRN avoidance
cornerstone. It provides the information transfer necessary to develop the CBRN COP and
IM. Commanders at all levels must be provided with timely, accurate, and evaluated
information on contamination from CBRN attacks and ROTA. These incidents can have a
significant effect on any military operations, plans, and decisions. The primary means of
warning units of an actual or predicted CBRN hazard is the CBRNWRS. The CBRNWRS
allows commanders and CBRN staffs to determine required protective measures and plan
operations accordingly. It is the responsibility of commanders at all levels to ensure that
plans, directives, and SOPs consider CBRN defense as a priority.
2.   Organization
     The CBRNWRS provides a systematic organization of the CBRN COP information.
     a.    CBRN Warning and Reporting Areas. In order to organize the reporting,
evaluating, and sharing of CBRN incident information, the following information areas and
zones will be established:
            (1) The CBRN area of observation is a geographical area consisting of several
CBRN zones of observation. When operating in areas where the CBRN area of observation
is not defined beforehand, the area must be defined and agreed to by the involved
commands. An example of an area of observation would be Central Command
(CENTCOM).
           (2) The CBRN zone of observation is a geographical area which defines the
responsibility for collecting and reporting information on enemy or unidentified nuclear
detonations, CB attacks, NBC ROTAs, and resulting contamination. CBRN zones of
observations must cover the entire geographical area defined by a CBRN area of
observation. An example of a zone of observation would be a USA division AO.
      b.   CBRN Warning and Reporting Centers and Cells. These sections will be
responsible for processing and evaluating CBRN-related data, updating information
requirements, assisting with the development of the CBRN COP, and updating battlefield
intelligence. Refer to Appendix B for more information on the responsibilities and TTP on
CBRN center and cell operations.
3.   Information Management
     Managing the CBRNWRS is crucial for the success of a command. To be useful,
CBRN information must be collected, reported, and evaluated. Once evaluated, it can be
used to update battlefield intelligence. Obtaining and converting CBRN information into
usable intelligence does not just happen. The volume of information that needs to be


2 February 2006   FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56              III-1
collected and reported could easily disrupt communications and tactical operations if it is
not properly managed. This section describes what information is available and how that
information gets to the person or unit needing it.
      a.   Gathering Information. The first step in managing the CBRNWRS is to
determine what information is available and who is available to collect it. Two types of
data must be collected. Observer data provides information that a CBRN attack has
occurred. Monitoring, survey, and reconnaissance data provide information on where the
hazard is located. Every unit is responsible for observing and recording enemy attacks, but
every unit does not automatically forward NBC1 reports. For example, many units may
observe a nuclear burst, but if every unit forwarded a report, nothing would get through.
For this reason, selected units that have the equipment to make the accurate
measurements will submit the NBC1 reports. These units are called designated observers.
The units that are required to forward NBC reports will be designated in the field SOP,
OPORD, or OPLAN. Additional units are selected during tactical operations, based on
their physical locations. These units may or may not be listed in the OPORD.
           (1) Designated Observers. All units have some information-gathering
responsibilities. Certain units, because of their capabilities and location, are chosen as
designated observers for attacks. Designated observers must be as accurate as possible
when providing data on enemy releases. Observers are selected to provide total coverage
over the entire area of interest (AOI). This requires ground and aerial observers. The
designated observer system provides the essential data to prepare the hazard location
predictions and the CBRN damage assessments. It provides raw observer data, using a
standard report format. The communications section of the OPORD will specify the
primary and alternate means of communication.
                (a) Ground. Ground units are selected for the designated observer system
based on the following factors:
                •       Battlefield location.
                •       Available communication networks.
                •       Mission (current and future).
                •       Training and experience.
                •       Availability of accurate measuring devices.
                (b) Aerial. Aircraft provide excellent observer coverage for CBRN attacks.
The aviation unit commander selects the crews. Designated aircrews are instructed to
report data about the type of attack and when and where it occurred. If the aviators
measure the cloud parameters, they must also provide the location from which it was
measured. Aviators have the advantage of height. They are able to see and report actual
ground zero (GZ) locations. They also can see and estimate the crater width. Such data is
usually not obtainable from ground observer units.
           (2) Monitoring, Survey, and Reconnaissance Data. NBC1 reports are the first
step to predict where the CBRN hazards will be. These predictions (NBC3 reports) are only
an estimation of the hazard area. Feedback is needed from the reporting units to
determine exactly where the contamination is located.




III-2               FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56 2 February 2006
                 (a) This feedback comes from monitoring, survey, and reconnaissance
(NBC4 reports). Monitoring and reconnaissance operations give the initial location of the
CBRN hazards. The initial monitoring and reconnaissance reports are forwarded through
the intelligence channels to the processing CBRN center or cell. This information may also
be sent via integrated C2 systems (i.e, the JWARN).
                 (b) The NBC4 reports are then plotted on the situation map. If more
information is needed, the CBRN staff will direct a unit (picked because of its location and
capability) to collect and forward the necessary data. Depending on the type of information
required, this unit may be an organic CBRN defense team or a CBRN reconnaissance unit.
                 (c) The collection of CBRN information is a joint effort between tactical
units and the processing CBRN staff. The CBRN staff plans and directs the collection
effort. The field SOP, OPORD, or OPLAN will describe who collects and forwards the
information for an evaluation.
      b.    Evaluating Information. After an attack has occurred and the data has been
collected, it will be forwarded to, and evaluated by, the CBRN center or cell. It will then be
used to update the battlefield intelligence. Units and intermediate HQ may use the raw
data that is being reported to develop their own intelligence until detailed results are made
available from the CBRN cell.
      c.    Transmitting Information. Procedures used to transmit information to and from
the CBRN cell are an important part of the CBRNWRS. The signal or communications
section of the SOP, OPORD, or OPLAN will outline what information is to be sent to what
sections. Figure III-1, page III-4, shows the direction that various NBC reports will travel.
Usually, the flow of the CBRN data is through the normal chain of command; however,
there are some exceptions.
           (1) The CBRN center or cell may request information, such as R&S
information. The unit doing the survey shall be responsible and will report directly back to
the CBRN cell. This is especially true for aerial surveys. The surveying unit should also
send a copy back to its parent unit for archiving and recording of the CBRN exposure, if
necessary.
          (2)     The designated observers will send the reports directly to the CBRN cell.
          (3) The attached units or operational control units may have no direct contact
with a parent unit. In these cases, their HQ will receive the information.
           (4) The units that operate independently in an area will report through the HQ
controlling that AO.

           (5) The method of transmitting the information depends on the tactical
situation and mission of the unit. Methods will be specified in OPORDs, OPLANs, or unit
SOPs.
           (6) The NBC reports should be formatted ahead of time and be as short and
concise as possible. In this case, wire communications are best.
4.      Types of Reports
   The CBRNWRS uses standardized reports to effectively organize and disseminate
CBRN COP information.
      a.    Standard CBRN Reports. The CBRNWRS consists of six standard reports for
CBRN incidents. The STANAG and the US message text format (USMTF) standardize each
of the CBRN reports. The United States and its NATO allies use the same message
formats. This improves the accuracy, comprehension, and interoperability of the system. It
also increases the speed of dissemination and submission. The standard NBC reports are
as follows:
         (1) The NBC1 report is an observer’s report. This report gives the basic data of
the CBRN attack.
            (2)   The NBC2 report is used to pass evaluated data from the collected NBC1
reports.


III-4             FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56 2 February 2006
         (3) The NBC3 report is used to provide immediate warning of the predicted
contamination and hazard areas.
          (4) The NBC4 report is used to report detection data and pass monitoring and
survey results. This report is used if an attack is not observed and the first indication of
the contamination is by detection.
          (5) The NBC5 report is used to pass information of an actual contamination.
This report can also include areas of possible contamination, but only when the actual
contamination coordinates are also included in the report.
          (6)     The NBC6 report is used to pass detailed information of the CBRN events.
            (7) The CBRN reports use a standard format and line items to shorten the
message (see Table III-1). The CBRNWRS is based on a code letter system. The meaning
of each letter used to transmit an NBC report is described in this MTTP. Each type of NBC
report is comprised of a sequence of lines and has a unique identifier. Letter formats for
the CBRNWRS and the meaning of the lines are described below in Table III-1 and in the
applicable appendix for the specific type of report. Each set contains a sequence of fields.
NBC reports start with a common message heading consisting of the NBC report number
(1–6), and the event. The format for the fields, allowable entries, and conditions are
explained later in this chapter and the applicable appendixes.

      b.   The Merchant Warning System (MERWARN). A simplified contamination
warning system has been established throughout NATO for broadcasting warnings of a
contamination dangerous to the merchant shipping. This system calls for the origination of
five types of messages by NATO naval authorities.
          (1) MERWARN NBC Effective Downwind Message (EDM). The MERWARN
NBC EDM is a prediction of the fallout that will result from a 1-megaton (mt) nuclear
surface explosion in a specified sea area at a specified time. It will give the master of a ship,
observing a nuclear explosion, an immediate indication of the area likely to be affected by
fallout.
           (2) MERWARN NBC3 Nuclear. This message will be issued after a nuclear
attack and gives fallout data for a specific nuclear explosion or series of explosions, which
will be identified in the message.
            (3) MERWARN NBC Chemical Downwind Message (CDM). This contains a
forecast of the MET data needed for the chemical hazard area prediction procedure.
          (4) MERWARN NBC3 Chemical. This message is issued to pass immediate
warning of a predicted chemical contamination and hazard area.
           (5) MERWARN Diversion Order. This is a general diversion order, based upon
the fallout threat, whereby merchant ships proceeding independently are passed evasive
routing instructions of a general nature.

NOTE: In some cases, it may be better to provide warning of a contamination by
means of general plain language messages rather than by the formats above. See
Appendix C for more information on CB MERWARN messages and Appendix G
for more information on nuclear MERWARN messages.
      c.   Strike Warning (STRIKWARN). Friendly forces need to receive advanced
warning of a nuclear strike to ensure that they are not placed at unnecessary risk. Such
attacks are announced through a STRIKWARN message. This message applies to nuclear
strikes that may affect forces operating on land, over land, or at sea. STRIKWARN
messages typically use automatic data processing (ADP) messages, but can use alternate
means of communication to transmit warnings using the STRIKWARN format. Appendix I
of this manual covers STRIKWARN in more detail.
     d.    MET and Weather Reports. Current MET data is a vital prerequisite for
radiological fallout and CB and ROTA downwind hazard prediction. MET data is
transmitted as a basic wind report (BWR). The effective downwind report (EDR) and the
chemical downwind report (CDR) are prepared at the CBRN control center and are
disseminated to all units served by the preparing CBRN control center.
         (1) BWR. A BWR is a basic wind message (BWM) or a basic wind forecast
(BWF). This message contains the basic MET data to be used for a fallout prediction (see
Appendix D). A BWR is an ADP-formatted message used to accommodate the BWM or the
BWF when transmitted.
           (2) EDR. An EDR is an EDM or an effective downwind forecast (EDF). This
message contains information on downwind speed and downwind direction for each of seven
preselected nuclear weapon yields (see Appendix I). An EDR is an ADP-formatted message
used to accommodate the EDM or the EDF message when transmitted.
           (3) CDR. A CDR is a CDM or a chemical downwind forecast (CDF). This
message contains basic MET information for predicting a biological aerosol (see Appendix
E) and chemical vapor hazard area (see Appendix F). A CDR is an ADP-formatted message
used to accommodate the NBC CDM or the NBC CDF message when transmitted.
5.   Mandatory Entries in Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reports
      In order to process and evaluate the CBRN attack data quicker and with more
efficiency, ensure that the information is valid and assist in manually inputting the data
into the automated systems (each line has mandatory information that must be entered for
the NBC message to be properly formatted). Certain rules apply to all lines or messages
and are as follows (see Table III-2, page III-8, for information required by line):
    a.    The field contents are described by one of the following: A = alphabetic, N =
numeric, S = special characters (comprised of six characters [.,-()?]), B = blank, and X = any
combination of ANBS. Combinations of the codes exist in some fields.
      b.   The fields must be filled with the number and the type of characters identified,
or a dash (-) may be inserted into a field when the information is not available. However,
some fields vary in length, which is indicated by giving a range for the number of
characters (for example, 1-20X).
     c.   When a line is repeatable, it is indicated by a preceding asterisk (for example,
*=3 indicates that data can be entered up to three times).

     d.    If a repeatable line is used, then all fields within that line must be used each
time that line is repeated.
        e.       In manual procedures, all information under one set is put into one sentence.
     f.    In STRIKWARN messages, the units of measurement are default values and are,
therefore, excluded from the fields.
      g.   All directional/angular measurements must be stated in degrees (3N) or mils
(4N) (for example, 40 degrees = 040, 18 mils = 0018).
        h.       Sets or fields are mandatory (M), operationally determined (O), or conditional
(C).

6.    Classification and Precedence
     The classification and precedence of the CBRN messages ensure that they are
disseminated in a timely and effective manner.
     a.   Classification. Unless the NBC message contains specific operational
information (e.g., effects on troops), all such messages should be unclassified.
       b.   Precedence. NBC1 messages reporting the first enemy use of CBRN weapons
(first use of nuclear weapons, first use of biological weapons, and first use of chemical
weapons) or ROTA incidents must be given FLASH precedence. All other messages should
be given a precedence that reflects the operational value of the contents. Normally,
IMMEDIATE would be appropriate. Once a CBRN event occurs, the number of NBC
messages will be substantial. CBRN staffs must prepare their SOPs carefully in order to
avoid an unnecessary load on the communication systems.
7.    Decision Support Tools
     Collecting, evaluating, processing, and relaying all the reports from the field can be an
extremely difficult and time-consuming task when done manually. In order to help reduce

the number of errors and expedite the process, the United States Government (USG) has
developed various modeling programs and systems to help commanders make more
informed decisions quicker and more accurately. There are a large number of models
available through various Department of Defense (DOD) and other federal agencies. Models
are volatile and dynamic; therefore, considerable expertise is required to avoid misuse or
misreading of the results. For additional information on models, refer to the Modeling and
Simulation Information Analysis Center Web site <www.msiac.dmso.mil>.
8.       Technical Reach-Back Capabilities
     The commander will require not only accurate and timely information but also
tremendous reach-back capabilities. Reach-back occurs when commanders access the
capabilities of remotely located informational resources through their C2 systems. Reach-
back is a process that employs communications assets to identify and bring to bear
resources that are not present at a CBRN site.
         a.   General.
           (1) Technical reach-back is the ability to contact technical subject matter
experts (SMEs) when a technical issue exceeds the on-scene SME’s capability. Reach-back
should be conducted using established unit protocols. Many of the listed reach-back
resources have other primary missions and are not specifically resourced for reach-back.
Issues may include the following:
                 (a) Nonstandard Agent Identification of CBRN and TIM. If a TIM is used
or is suspected, CBRN personnel must obtain technical information. This information could
include persistency, medical effects, and decontamination or protection requirements.
                (b) Modeling/Hazard Prediction. The spread of contamination must be
known to operational units. Technical experts can use modeling to provide a better
indication of where vapor, liquid, or aerosolized hazards may occur. Technical reach-back
should provide the ability for detailed analysis of the area to assist in determining
downwind hazard areas and locating staging areas, operation centers, decontamination
sites, etc.
          (2) Reach-back can be accomplished through various means, from the
telephone to broadband satellites.
      b.   Technical Reach-Back Capabilities. The following technical reach-back capability
is available if technical issues exceed on-site, local SME capabilities (see Table III-5).

     CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR 

               CENTER AND CELL OPERATIONS


1.   Background
     The CBRN cell is the focal point for all data relating to a CBRN attack or a ROTA
event within the established AO. The organizations of the CBRN cells will be theater-,
mission- and service-dependent, which is meant to be flexible in size and composition.
2.   Responsibilities
       The responsibilities of the CBRN staff will vary depending on the echelon where the
cell is established. All CBRN cells will have several of the same functions regardless of the
established echelon. These common functions include the following:
     •    Advising the commander and staff on CBRN defense matters.
     •    Monitoring the subordinate unit’s CBRN status.
     •    Operating the CBRNWRS for the AO where established.
     •    Assisting with vulnerability analysis.
      •    Assisting the intelligence section with the identification of CBRN-related
intelligence requirements.
      •    Assisting the intelligence section with the interpretation of CBRN-related
intelligence.
     a.   Theater, Corps, Air Force, and Fleet Levels of Command. The CBRN cells must
have an appropriate number of personnel who are equipped, trained, and qualified to
perform tasks efficiently and rapidly (see Table B-1 for a sample structure). They must—

          Senior NCO/petty officer                                   A
          Computer/plotters (two per shift)                       A and B
          Clerk typist (one per shift)                            A and B
          Operations NCO/petty officer                               B

         (1)      Assess the status and capability of friendly units operating in the CBRN
environment.
                 (a) The CBRN cell evaluates the impact of the CBRN contamination on
the tactical operations. The evaluation may include the following information:
                  •     The degree of contamination at selected points or areas.




2 February 2006    FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                  B-1
                •    The effects of contamination on tactical units.
               •    The protection required by troops operating in designated
contaminated areas.
The CBRN cell must be prepared to recommend the length of time troops can safely operate
within the radiologically contaminated areas. In coordination with the surgeon’s staff, the
CBRN cell must be prepared to make recommendations about the psychological aspects of
prolonged operations in MOPP gear.
                 (b) The CBRN cell may then recommend the type and quantity of supplies
and equipment required to support the decontamination operations. The CBRN cell
balances these recommendations with the information received from the contaminated unit
and the logistics staff officer on the availability of the supplies and equipment.
         (2) Maintain the status and coordination of CBRN support (i.e.,
decontamination or reconnaissance units).
                (a) When information in the AOI is inadequate, the CBRN cell, in
cooperation with appropriate support elements, recommends locations for conducting
surveys. The CBRN cell may coordinate and control a survey if transportation,
communications, and personnel assets are available. The CBRN cell briefs the survey
parties and designates the areas to be surveyed. The briefing includes the type, amount,
frequency, and means of reporting. For detailed procedures pertaining to monitoring and
surveying, see Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and
Chemical Reconnaissance.
                (b) The CBRN cells at this level may also be responsible for the
organization and implementation of the sampling, identification, and evacuation of the CB
agents. This information can be critical in treating patients and confirming an exposure. It
can also be used as evidence in a prosecution.
           (3) Transmit CBRN warnings (NBC3 report) to the adjacent HQ and to
military and civilian agencies when the predicted hazard areas extend beyond the area of
responsibility (AOR).
          (4)   Organize and coordinate the CBRNWRS within the AOs.
           (5) Track information on enemy CBRN activities. CBRN personnel prepare an
overlay showing the locations, times, number, and extent of enemy CBRN attacks. This
overlay provides higher commands with data on the number of attacks or strikes reported
and the nuclear yields employed. It also gives a brief assessment of the significance of
these strikes.
          (6)   Make final filtering and correlation of the CBRN incidents within the AO.
     b.    Area and Maritime HQ. The area and maritime HQ must maintain direct
communication with the regional HQ and the appropriate units of the national civil defense
organizations concerned. Information and predictions of the land areas that will be affected
by the fallout should be passed to the area HQ or the relevant CBRN center. In the same
manner, the information on the CBRN and ROTA hazards should be exchanged between
the area and maritime HQ.

     c.    Fixed-Site, Division, Regiment, Brigade, and Designated Shipboard and Wing
Levels of Command. The responsibilities at the designated fixed-site, division, regiment,
brigade, shipboard and wing levels of command have common duties and responsibilities for
a higher and lower echelon CBRN reporting agency. At this level, some of the main duties
include the following:
          (1)     Receiving, consolidating, and evaluating reports of the following:
          •     CBRN attacks.
          •     ROTA.
          • Resultant contamination within the AO (for the unit where the center is
established).
          (2) Performing computer modeling and simulations. This level has the
resources and techniques available to conduct the more involved and complicated
procedures. These techniques and procedures are based on the comparison of data from
many sources (much of the data used is not available to a single unit).
            (3) Executing tasks in the AO, which have influence on the unit’s or subunit’s
operations. The NBC reports generated or processed at this level will have a line ALPHA
(strike serial number).
            (4) Calculating detailed fallout predictions, including recalculations as a result
of significant weather changes and passing the appropriate warnings to the units likely to
be affected (NBC3 report).
          (5)     Directing CBRN reconnaissance and survey efforts within the AO.
          (6) Analyzing the survey and monitoring results and passing the information
on the contaminated areas to the units likely to be affected (NBC4 and NBC5 reports).
           (7) Requesting and providing detailed information on the CBRN or ROTA
events, as directed (NBC6 report).
           (8) Exchanging CBRN information with the appropriate national, military, and
civilian authorities as outlined by directives and SOPs.
         (9) Providing information to merchant shipping on the predicted or actual
contamination via MERWARN.
           (10) Maintaining the CBRN situation map. At this level, the CBRN cell plots
data from the NBC reports on the tactical situation maps and overlays. These maps and
overlays show the actual areas affected by the contamination at a selected time and for a
given AOI. The maps and overlays also show the predicted downwind hazard areas. CBRN
personnel recompute and adjust the prediction several times daily based on the changes,
decay rate, additional contamination, and tactical situation.
          (11) Preparing and disseminating wind messages (see Appendix D).
           (12) Providing technical assistance in the interrogation of prisoners of war. This
technical assistance is generally in the form of providing the interrogator with a list of
questions to ask the prisoner. The questions may involve employment tactics, CBRN
munitions, types of weapon systems available, and defense training status.
          (13) Assisting the commander with the selection of designated observers.

      d.   Unit Level of Command and Designated Observers. The unit level procedures
and designated observer’s primary concern is the collection of useful data for the CBRN cell
and not the detailed analysis or evaluation of the data. The processing and analysis
techniques at this level are designed for the rapid evaluation of data. These results are not
as accurate as those obtained by the CBRN cell, but are sufficient for planning until they
can be replaced. Designated observers are any unit tasked to report and forward
information to a CBRN cell, such as CBRN observation posts, survey and reconnaissance
teams, and preattack reconnaissance teams. Designated observers and unit level CBRN
sections are responsible for—
         (1) Reporting the initial enemy use of CBRN weapons by the most expeditious
means available in accordance with directives and SOPs (NBC1 report).
           (2) Immediately reporting any CBRN incident and subsequent data to the
respective CBRN center (NBC1 or NBC4 report).
           (3) Reporting detection data, monitoring, reconnaissance and survey results to
the respective CBRN cell (NBC4 report).
           (4) Plotting simplified hazard predictions (see Appendixes E, F, G, and H for
detailed instructions on how to complete them).
         (5) Submitting detailed information on CBRN and ROTA events as requested
(NBC6 report).
          (6)   Monitoring for symptoms, radiation, and causalities.
          (7)   Collecting and forwarding samples.
      e.    Coordination. Coordination is essential for proper contingency planning at all
levels of the CBRN warning and reporting organization. This planning provides CBRN
information rapidly where it is required and reduces the duplication of reports.
Cooperation and coordination between the NATO CBRNWRS and the national military and
civilian systems are important strengthening factors to the common defense effort. The
details of information exchange depend upon national policy and the structure of the
national forces and civil defense organizations. Commanders must delegate authority to
the appropriate levels of command for negotiating agreements and arrangements with
corresponding national armed forces and civil defense authorities. Warning information
should be exchanged at the lowest level possible.
     f.   Responsibilities. To achieve success on the modern battlefield, commanders and
CBRN staffs must create an effective and efficient C2 system for CBRN support efforts.
The CBRN staff must clearly understand its responsibilities and relationships with the
supported commanders and their staff elements.
         (1) The CBRN staff officer is the principal advisor to the force commander for
all CBRN matters. He is responsible for the following:
            •     CBRN support to all elements of the force according to the decisions and
priorities of the force commander.
          •     Staff planning and coordination for all CBRN subordinate units.
          •     Staff supervision during the execution of the CBRN support operations.

           (2)    The senior CBRN NCO’s or petty officer’s primary responsibilities include
the following:
          •       Train enlisted personnel within the CBRN cell.
            •    Assist the shift officer in charge (OIC) as a 12-hour shift noncommissioned
officer in charge (NCOIC).
          •       Supervise the processing of the CBRN attack information,
        •   Coordinate with the other staff sections in preparing and disseminating the
CDM and EDM messages and managing the CBRNWRS.
          •       Ensure that all staff journals, files, and records are maintained.
          •       Supervise the maintenance of the section’s vehicles.
          •    Advise the senior CBRN officer on the distribution of chemical personnel
within the AO and advise on readiness issues.
          (3)     The computer and plotter are responsible for the following:
         •   Receive, process, and plot the CBRN attack information and determine
downwind hazard predictions of the enemy CB agent clouds and radioactive fallout.
          •       Prepare the appropriate NBC reports and distribute them.
          •       Maintain the visual displays and staff journals as required.
          •       Maintain the CBRN situation map in the CBRN cell.
          •       Gather CBRN information from the subordinate command’s SITREPs.
          •    Use various DSTs to assist with the hazard prediction and sending and
receiving messages.
          •       Transmit the detailed instructions to radiological survey parties and survey
operations.
          •     Calculate the transmission factors (TFs) and correlation factors (CFs) from
the data provided by radiological monitoring or survey parties.
          •       Prepare and disseminate the EDMs and CDMs.
        •         Select the CFs for the radiological decay (from tables, graphs, or
nomograms).
           •    Convert the radiological contamination data to the ground dose rates at a
reference time.
          •       Maintain the radiation status reports of subordinate units.
          (4)     The operations NCO’s or petty officer’s duties include the following:
          •       Assist with the processing of CBRN attack information.
          •       Coordinate with the other staff sections.
          •       Prepare and disseminate CDMs and EDMs.
          •       Manage the CBRNWRS.

            •    Ensure that all staff journals, files, and records are maintained.
            •    Assist the senior NCO or petty officer.
            (5) The clerk performs general administrative support functions for the CBRN
cell. The clerk’s duties include the following:
            •   Act as the radio-telephone operator.
            •   Prepare and dispatch messages and maintain the daily staff journal/message
file.
           • Record and forward NBC messages to the plotters and prepare chemical and
radiological contamination overlays for transmission.
3.      Overlap and Duplication
      For functional and operational reasons, the AOR of NATO, USA, USAF and USN
forces overlap. In addition, the AOR of the USA, civil defense, and forces not assigned to
the NATO may overlap or even be identical. NBC reports will inevitably be duplicated,
particularly in the case of a nuclear detonation. Therefore, commanders at all levels must
ensure that their plans are fully coordinated with all neighboring CBRN centers in order to
avoid duplication of reports and to ensure the rapid and efficient exchange of useful CBRN
information. CBRN warning and reporting plans must be available and must state the
requirement for the NBC reports to be submitted between units.
4.      Correlation of Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reports
      a.   The purpose of this correlation is to show the relationship between NBC
messages and to help determine whether a CBRN incident is a stand-alone incident or
belongs with a multiple strike. Whenever new reports are received, they should be
correlated with the existing reports. Some specific lines or sets to pay particular attention
to include the following:
        •   Set Bravo—location of the observer and direction of the attack.
        •   Set Golf—delivery means and quantity.
        •   Set India—release of information.
      b.    Using the sets above, the CBRN defense specialist and officer can determine whether
the attacks occurred in the same proximity, whether the means of delivery and quantity were
identical or similar (fog of war), agent likeness, air or ground burst, and liquid or vapor.

                                        Appendix C 

     MANAGEMENT OF EXPOSURE TO RADIOLOGICAL HAZARDS 


1.   Background
      The exposure of forces to a radiological and nuclear hazard can have an immediate
effect on personnel or affect their health or ability to survive subsequent exposures in the
longer term.
     a.    Exposure Control. International recommendations and national regulations of
various force components cover the management of exposure to ionizing radiation. There
are also various regulations covering the exposure of personnel to other toxic industrial
hazards. However, these are yet to become as pervasive as the ionizing radiation
regulations. The joint force commander’s operational exposure guide (OEG) needs to be
prepared in the preevent phase.
           (1) US forces and subordinate commanders will avoid exposing personnel to
radiological hazards.
            (2) Where the avoidance of exposure is impractical because of other operational
priorities, exposure is to be as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). The local
commander needs to balance the successful outcome of the mission with the maintenance of
the ALARA principle.
           (3) Exposure or suspected exposure to a radiological hazard needs to be
recorded to assist the short-term and possible long-term employment of personnel.
           (4) By waiting to enter a contaminated area, the contamination level will
usually be reduced and, with it, the chance of exposure. Exposure can also be accidental.
Personnel may not know that equipment is contaminated. Usually, this can be prevented
by always marking contaminated equipment, but there are places where contamination
hazards can accumulate (e.g., in air filters). All engines have air filters which trap
contaminants, and these contaminants accumulate. Even if the hazard area is small, it can
be deadly. Persons working around equipment should be aware of hidden hazards. Always
dispose of contaminated collectors, such as air filters, as contaminated waste.
           (5) All plans should include postattack procedures for limiting exposure to a
radiological hazard. The longer a person is exposed to the contamination, the greater the
chance of becoming a casualty. Only the personnel required to accomplish a mission should
be sent into a contaminated area.
     b.    Data Recording. The exposure of personnel to hazards will be recorded. This is
so that, where practical, exposure levels can be made similar across the force and the
long-term health of the individuals can be managed.
      c.   Rotation of Assets. If it is necessary for operational reasons, commanders and
staff need to plan to rotate other forces through the area. This is so that exposure to the
hazards is kept as even as possible throughout the force according to the ALARA principle.
Such rotations will require a considerable planning effort by the joint staff if forces in the
hazard area have been or become contaminated by the hazards. Movement control to limit
the spread of decontamination may also be needed.



2 February 2006   FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                 C-1
2.    Information Management—Operational Exposure Guide
      a.    The OEG concept requires that all units maintain radiation exposure records.
For example, USA records are based on platoon level data received daily, or after a mission
in a radiological contaminated area. The unit dose is an average of the doses to individuals
in the unit who have dosimeters, usually two per squad in the USA. Therefore, the USA
assumes that each soldier receives an individual dose equal to that of the average for the
platoon. The records are usually kept by the unit chemical officer at the battalion level.
When a soldier transfers out of an exposed unit, the RES for that platoon is noted in the
soldier’s personnel file. When possible, soldiers are reassigned to platoons with the same
RES category. Although this might create personnel strength management problems, it is
intended to prevent personnel from incapacitation due to radiation overexposure in future
operations. The other services have service-specific requirements to maintain radiation
dose records. The individual dosimetry should be requested if the situation warrants, since
individual dosimetry can greatly assist with the patient assessment and management.
      b.    The credibility of leaders and the trust on which that credibility is based must be
maintained. Leaders must keep the troops informed on the possible mission exposures,
realistic risk estimates, unit dose information from radiac equipment, and any other
information that removes ambiguities and uncertainties in any given situation. Leaders
must address, not dismiss, real concerns. The leaders should know the OEG for their
mission, the RES of their unit, and the risks associated with their mission. They should
have an understanding of the acute radiation exposure hazards in comparison with the
immediate dangers of a conventional combat. They should also understand the potential
for long-term health risks when troops receive radiation exposures. Leaders should also be
knowledgeable on how to request assistance for interpreting the risks associated with
radiation exposures.
3.    Nuclear and Radiological Exposure Control
     Nuclear and radiological exposure control ensures the safety of all personnel operating
in and near these environments.
     a.    Radiation Exposure Control. Radiation exposure plans and the OEG need to be
prepared in the preevent phase. This will be based on the CBRN IPB and the results of
in-theater reconnaissance and survey of the local nuclear and radiological TIM facilities.
Commanders and staffs need to ensure that—
          (1) Exposure to radiation hazards is recorded by the issue and use of individual
and group reading dosimeters, to national force components as appropriate.
           (2) Exposure of groups to radiation is controlled by the calculation of nuclear
RES and control doses so that the radiation doses received by groups are evenly distributed
according to STANAG 2083.
          (3) Long-term medical records need to be maintained for all personnel after
any exposure to ionizing radiation above normal, local background radiation.
           (4) All plans should include postattack procedures for limiting exposure to
radiological hazards. The amount of an exposure is important. Every minute spent in a
radiologically contaminated environment increases a person’s total radiation dose. Only
personnel required to accomplish a mission are sent into a contaminated area.

     b.    Low-Level Radiation (LLR). Unlike residual radiation deposited by a nuclear
detonation, LLR hazards may result from highly diverse materials and represent a wide
range of hazards. Figure C-1 provides flowcharts to conduct decision making for LLR.
Possible sources of LLR include the following:

          (5) Military Commodities. Some military munitions (e.g., depleted uranium
[DU]) and equipment contain radiation, which may present a radiation hazard if disrupted.
      c.   Medical Effects of LLR.
           (1) Late or delayed effects of a radiation exposure occur following a wide range
of doses and dose rates. Delayed effects may appear months to years after irradiation and
include a wide variety of effects involving almost all tissues and organs. Some of the
possible delayed consequences of radiation injury include the following:
           •    Shorter life.
           •    Carcinogenesis.
           •    Cataract formation.
           •    Chronic radiodermatitis.
           •    Decreased fertility.
           •    Genetic mutations.
The effect upon future generations is unclear. Data from Japan and Russia have not
demonstrated the significant genetic effects in humans.
           (2) Delivering the same gamma radiation dose at a much lower dose rate or in
fractions over a long period of time allows tissue repair to occur. There is a consequent
decrease in the total level of injury that would be expected from a single dose of the same
magnitude delivered over a short period of time. Neutron radiation damage does not
appear to be dose rate-dependent.
           (3) Chronic radiation syndrome (CRS) is defined as a complex clinical
syndrome occurring as a result of the long-term exposure to single or total radiation doses
that regularly exceed the permissible occupational dose. CRS is highly unlikely to affect
military personnel in operational settings. Prolonged deployments to heavily contaminated
areas or long-term ingestion of highly contaminated food or water would be required for
CRS. A near-ground weapon detonation, radiological dispersal device (RDD), major reactor
accident, or similar event that creates contamination with high dose rates, given prolonged
exposure, would permit development of CRS.
      d.   Command Radiation Exposure Guidance. Commanders will require advice from
their medical officers concerning the radiation effects on their personnel. Medical advice
must be practical and be based upon the requirements of the mission and the diversity of
the human response to radiation. Overreaction to a contamination could make enemy use
of an RDD more tenable. The effects of radiation that exceeds the normal occupational
exposure levels must not be minimized or exaggerated. CBRN risks must be in their proper
places relative to the other hazards of combat. Widespread environmental radiological
contamination can never be so great as to preclude mandatory mission accomplishment.
Maintain dose records of those exposed to the LLR.
          (1) Commanders need to be aware of the individual dose histories when
planning future operations that are at risk of LLR exposure.

           (2) On completion of the military operation, long-term health monitoring may
be required for those personnel who have been exposed to radiation. This should be done
according to the national regulations. A postoperation assessment of the internal doses
may also be required.
      e.   Personnel Evacuation From a Radiological Area. When evacuation personnel are
sent into a radiologically contaminated area, an OEG must be established. Prolonged
wearing of the IPE under MOPP conditions, the climate, workload, and fatigue combine to
limit personnel effectiveness and, consequently, hamper casualty evacuation. Based on
factors such as missions, priorities, and OEG, commanders decide which of the evacuation
assets will be sent into the contaminated area. As a general principle, to limit the
contamination of evacuation assets, patients should be decontaminated before the
evacuation.
     f.    RDD. The severity of the psychological effects of an RDD will depend on the
nature of the RDD material itself and the method of deployment. A point source of
radiation produces physical injury only to the soldiers within its immediate vicinity. An
RDD that uses a conventional explosion as a dispersal method will cause psychological
injury from the physical effects of the blast in addition to the radiation and heavy-metal
hazard inherent in many radioactive materials. The misinterpretation of the explosion as a
nuclear detonation may induce psychological effects similar to those produced by a true
nuclear detonation. The number of casualties from the blast and a generally more frantic
situation will intensify the level of stress on soldiers.
           (1) The presence of an RDD within a civilian population center will produce
more detrimental psychological damage to the soldiers than it will to a military target.
Military units in a theater of operation during war often have limited contact with civilian
populations. However, during peacetime missions (such as operations other than war
[OOTW]), a closer relationship may exist between civilians and soldiers. The treatment of
civilian casualties, particularly children, from the exposure to an RDD could markedly
increase the psychological impact on soldiers.
           (2) Mass psychosomatic symptoms from the unrealistic fear of the effects of
radioactive material pervasive in many civilian populations could severely overload medical
support and operations.
4.   Radiological Exposure
     Radiological exposure must be controlled to ensure the safety of all personnel.
Exposure levels have been developed to categorize and manage the risk posed to
warfighters who have been exposed to radiation.
      a.   Radiation Exposure During War. Consult medical specialists for medical
assessments and recommendations. With exposures below 125 centigray (cGy), the overall
effectiveness of combat units will not be degraded. However, above this threshold,
commanders must be aware that their force’s capability to fight will be diminished. The
term “combat effective” is used for personnel who will be suffering radiation sickness signs
and symptoms to a limited degree and who will be able to maintain their performance at
least 75 percent of their preexposure performance level. Those individuals who are
predicted to be “performance degraded” would be operating at a performance level between
25 and 75 percent of their preexposure performance. Those predicted as “combat
ineffective” should be considered as capable of performing their tasks at 25 percent (at best)

        b.     RES.
           (1) The RES of a given unit is based on the operational exposure above normal
background radiation. It is designed to be an average, based on unit level dosimeters, and
is not useful for the individual casualty. The degree-of-risk concept helps the commander
establish an OEG for a single operation and minimize the number of radiation casualties.
By using the RES categories of subordinate units, the commander establishes an OEG
based on the acceptable degree of risk.
           (2) Medical officers may adjust a unit’s RES after careful evaluation of the
exact exposure status of individual members of the unit. When possible, the physical and
biological dosimetry should be used in this regard. The unit status should reflect the
arithmetic mode of the available radiation exposure history of all individual members. Any
unit member whose exposure status is more than one category greater than the mode
should be replaced (or designated as a subcategory in OOTW). A command health physicist
should be consulted whenever possible. When the exposure dose rate is known to be less
than 5 cGy per day, the repair of an injury is enhanced and the time for cellular repair us
reduced. In these circumstances, dosimetry should be available that would allow the RES
category to be reduced after 3 months at the normal background levels. When individual
dosimetry is unavailable, a period of 6 months (since the last radiation exposure above
background) is sufficient to upgrade a unit’s RES status one category or subcategory one
time only. Tables C-3 and C-4 (page C-9) provide RES categories and their respective
effects.

  LI is the casualty criterion defined as the lowest dose at which performance is degraded (i.e., 25–75%
capable) within 3 hours and will remain so until death or recovery or become combat ineffective at any
time within 6 weeks.

      c.   Nuclear Risk Criteria. There are three degrees of risk—negligible, moderate,
and emergency. Table C-4 provides the risks associated with each respective RES category.
Latent ineffectiveness (LI) is the casualty criterion defined as the lowest dose at which
performance is degraded (i.e., 25 to 75 percent capable) within 3 hours and will remain so
until death or recovery or become combat ineffective at any time within 6 weeks.
     •     Negligible (1 percent LI). Negligible risk is acceptable when the mission requires
units to operate in a contaminated environment. However, it should not be exceeded
unless a significant advantage will be gained.
      •     Moderate (2.5 percent LI). Moderate risk is usually acceptable in close support
operations. Moderate risk must not be exceeded if troops are expected to operate at full
efficiency.
     •     Emergency (5 percent LI). The emergency risk dose is only acceptable in rare
situations termed disaster situations. Only the commander can decide when the risk of the
disaster situation outweighs the radiation emergency risk.

  NOTES:
  1. RES categories are based on previous exposure. Risk levels are graduated within each RES
  category in order to provide more stringent criteria as the total radiation dose accumulated
  becomes more serious.
  2. Reclassification from one RES category to a less serious one is made by the commander upon
  advice from medical personnel and after ample observation of the actual state of health of exposed
  personnel.
  3. All exposures to radiation are considered total body and simply additive. No allowance is made
  for body recovery from radiation injury.
  4. Exposure criteria given for RES-1 and RES-2 units should be used only when the numerical
  value of a unit’s total past cumulative dose is unknown.
  5. Each of the degrees of risk can be applied to radiation hazards resulting from enemy or friendly
  weapons or both and from initial nuclear radiation resulting from planned friendly supporting fire.

     d.    Radiation Exposure During Military Support to Civil Authorities. The Health
Physics Society believes that the receipt of doses of ionizing radiation by responders to a
nuclear terrorism event is unavoidable and justifiable. For certain individuals, doses could
exceed levels normally encountered in the typical utilization of radiation (e.g., occupational
exposures, exposures to medical practitioners and patients). While regulatory limits of
exposure have been well-described for radiation doses from such routine utilization of
radioactivity and radiation, exposure limits for emergency workers are not well-described.
           (1) Occupational Versus Emergency Dose Limits. In the regulatory scheme for
occupational radiation exposure, a number of dose limits have been defined and described
for members of the public and occupationally exposed persons. The basic assumptions used
to derive these limits involve a balance of risk to the individual against the benefits to be
obtained by permitting such exposure (both to the individual and to society). In a terrorist
event, however, the assumptions used in the justification of limits would not likely apply,
thus the limits may not be appropriate to members of the public nor to personnel
responding to the event.
            (2) Dose Guidelines to Responders to a Terrorist Event. The use of
radioactivity or radiation as a means of a terrorist attack will result in dose rates
significantly higher than natural background. In a terrorist event, immediate response is
critical for the mitigation of effects, saving lives, protecting property, and the timely
restoration of the affected area, particularly where the affected area has significant
economic or iconic value to the area or country. Such compelling needs justify higher levels
of dose rates in the performance of these duties, much higher than would normally be
justified from routine life activities. Accordingly, higher dose limits can be justified (see
Table C-6, page C-14). The following dose guidelines apply during response to a terrorist
event:
           •      The dose rate will not exceed 50 REM for the responders.
          •   Provisions are in place for long-term MEDSURV of the responders that
exceed 25 REM.
           •    The individuals most likely to be permitted these levels of exposures would
be professional responders (e.g., firefighters, police, emergency medical technicians [EMTs])
who, by sake of employment, have implicitly agreed to assume the significant risks in a
rescue operation.
          •    The most likely effect at 50 REM would be some minor fluctuations in blood
count which are entirely reversible. In addition, the exposed persons might face a slightly
higher chance of incurring a fatal cancer.
           •    These risk levels are comparable to other risk factors which are commonly
found in these types of activities (e.g., smoke inhalation, physical trauma, heavy physical
exertion).
           •     The benefit of such individual exposure would be the mitigation of a
condition or situation that could result in dangerous levels of exposure to members of the
public or in some other way threaten the general public health and safety (e.g., the
mitigation of widespread fires or the protection of critical infrastructure that is needed for
organized evacuation or relocation of populations).

            •     The dose rate will not exceed 5 REM during routine duties other than
lifesaving, firefighting, etc.
              •     The dose rate for members the public will not exceed 0.1 REM.

                                                       personnel only. Members of the general public
                                                       are excluded.
     Incident Command                  0.10 cGy/hr     Command centers, staging areas, etc., may need
     Centers, Staging Areas,                           to be set up close to the event. Such areas
     etc.                                              should be established in a location that is below
                                                       the listed dose rate.
     Hot Zone                          1.00 cGy/hr     Responders should enter the area only on an as-
                                                       needed basis in order to accomplish specific
                                                       tasks.
     “Turn Around” Limit              100.00 cGy/hr    Dose rates in these areas represent levels of
                                                       radiation that require detailed planning to enter.
                                                       Entry is permitted only with special authorization
                                                       and to accomplish well-defined tasks.
     Justifiable Rescue Limit        1,000.00 cGy/hr   At this dose rate, the likelihood of the successful
                                                       rescue of victims is outweighed by the dose
                                                       effects to the responders. This guideline
                                                       represents the level that rescue operations may
                                                       not be justified. Enter such areas only after it has
                                                       been determined that the likelihood of success
                                                       outweighs the potential harm to the rescuers.

5.     Radioactive Materials of Military Significance
      A warfighter could potentially be exposed to various radioactive materials. Some are
more dangerous than others. Below is a listing of radioactive materials that are of
significance to the military.
       a.     Americium.
           (1) Americium-241 (241Am) is a decay daughter of plutonium and is primarily
an alpha emitter and a very low energy gamma emitter. It is detectable with a standard
radiac, such as the field instrument for detection of low-energy radiation (FIDLER)
instrument, due to the emission of a 60-kEv gamma ray.
           (2) Americium is used in smoke detectors and other instruments, and it will be
found in fallout from a nuclear-weapon detonation. It is used as a sealed source in the
M43A1 chemical agent detector that is a component of the M8A1 alarm.
           (3) Americium is a heavy-metal poison but, in large quantities, can cause
whole-body irradiation. Seventy-five percent of an initial lung burden is absorbed, with 10
percent of the particles retained in the lung. Gastrointestinal absorption of americium is
minimal, but it may be absorbed rapidly through skin wounds. External exposure is not a
concern unless large amounts of the substance are located in one area and personnel are in
close contact for an extended period of time.
       b.     Cesium.
           (1) Cesium-137 emits a beta particle as it decays to barium-137, which in turn
decays by emitting gamma rays. It emits gamma rays and beta radiation and can be
readily detected by gamma instruments.


C-14                  FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                   2 February 2006
          (2) Cesium-137 (137Ce) is found in medical radiotherapy devices and in soil
density and moisture testers. The mishandling of a medical radiotherapy device was
responsible for the worst radiation accident in the western hemisphere. It was used in the
Chechen RDD threat against Moscow.
           (3) Cesium is completely absorbed by the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and
wounds. It is soluble in most forms and is treated by metabolism as a potassium analog.
Excretion is in urine. Primary toxicity is whole-body irradiation. Deaths due to acute
radiation syndrome have occurred.
     c.   Cobalt.
           (1) Cobalt-60 (60Co) is used in medical radiotherapy devices and commercial
food irradiators. It will most likely be found after improper disposal or after the destruction
of a hospital or commercial facility. It generates high-energy gamma rays and 0.31 million
electron volts (MeV) of beta rays. It is easily detectable with a gamma detector.
          (2) Cobalt could be used as a contaminant in an improvised nuclear device to
make the fallout more radioactive.
          (3) Cobalt will be rapidly absorbed by the lung, but less than 5 percent will be
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Nothing is known about absorption through
wounds. Primary toxicity will be from whole-body irradiation and acute radiation
syndrome.
     d.   DU.
           (1) DU emits alpha, beta, and weak gamma radiation. Due to its high density,
much of the radiation never reaches the surface of the metal. It is, thus, self-shielding.
Also, intact DU rounds and armor are packaged to provide sufficient shielding that stops
beta and alpha radiations. Gamma radiation exposure is minimal. After several months of
continuous operations in an armored vehicle completely loaded with DU munitions, crew
exposures might exceed peacetime general-population exposure limits, but would not
exceed peacetime occupational exposure limits. Hence, DU is not a serious irradiation
threat. It is readily detectable with a typical end-window Geiger-Mueller™ counter.
           (2) Although DU is not a chemical or radiological hazard, it can present a
chemical toxicity hazard and, perhaps, a long-term radiological health risk under some
conditions when it is introduced internally to the body. Some risks associated with DU
munitions have been evaluated experimentally, some risks are still under study, and some
risks were identified from practical experience during Operation Desert Storm. DU
internalization via inhalation is the primary concern.
           (3) Inhaled DU compounds may be metabolized and result in urinary excretion.
The inhalation of DU oxides may occur during tank fires or by entering destroyed armored
vehicles without a protective mask. Absorption will be determined by the chemical state of
the DU. Soluble salts are readily absorbed; the metal is not. DU fragments in wounds
become encapsulated and are gradually metabolized, resulting in whole-body distribution,
particularly to bones and kidneys. In laboratory tests, DU does cross the placenta. No
renal toxicity has been documented to date.
     e.   Iodine.
           (1) Iodine-131, -132, -134, and -135 will be found after a reactor accident and
following the destruction of a nuclear reactor. Radioactive iodine is a normal fission


2 February 2006   FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56               C-15
product found in reactor fuel rods. It is released by rupturing the reactor core and its
containment vessel. Postdestruction winds will determine the fallout pattern. Most of the
radiation is beta rays, with some gamma.
           (2) Primary toxicity is to the thyroid gland. Thyroid uptake concentrates the
radioactive iodine and allows local irradiation similar to therapeutic thyroid ablation. A
high incidence of childhood thyroid carcinoma was documented following the Chernobyl
disaster.
     f.    Nickel-63. Nickel-63 is a pure beta emitter with a radiological half-life of 92
years and is used in chemical-agent monitors (CAMs). The beta energy of nickel-63 is too
low to penetrate the dead layer of skin; however, efforts should be taken to prevent
internalization.
       g.   Phosphorus.
          (1) Phosphorus-32 (32P) will generally be found in research laboratories and in
medical facilities where it is used as a tracer. It has a strong beta ray and can be detected
with the beta shield open on a beta-gamma detector.
         (2) Phosphorus is completely absorbed from all sites. It is deposited in the
bone marrow and other rapidly replicating cells. Local irradiation causes cell damage.
       h.   Plutonium.
           (1) Plutonium-238 and -239 (238 and 239 Pu) are produced from uranium in
reactors. It is the primary fissionable material in nuclear weapons and is the predominant
radioactive contaminant in nuclear-weapon accidents. The primary radiation is in the form
of alpha particles, so plutonium does not present an external irradiation hazard. It is
always contaminated with americium, which does have a fairly easily detectable X-ray by
use of a thin-walled gamma probe.
           (2) Five-micron or smaller particles will remain in the lung and are
metabolized based on the salt solubility. The particles that remain will cause local
irradiation damage. Gastrointestinal absorption will depend on the chemical state of the
plutonium; the metal is not absorbed. Stool specimens will be positive after 24 hours, and
urine specimens will be positive after 2 weeks. Wound absorption is variable. Plutonium
may be washed from intact skin.
       i.   Radium.
           (1) Radium-226 (226Ra) is not a federally regulated commodity and has no US
military use. It may be encountered in the former Soviet Union equipment as instrument
illumination, in industrial applications, and in older medical equipment. Primary radiation
is alpha particles, but daughter products emit beta and gamma rays and, in quantity, may
present a serious external irradiation hazard.
          (2) Most exposure is by ingestion, with 30 percent absorption. Little is known
about wound absorption, but radium will follow calcium to bone deposition. Long-term
exposure is associated with leukemia, aplastic anemia, and sarcomas.
NOTE: Former Soviet Union equipment is manufactured and used by militaries
throughout the world as a result of arms purchases and technology transfers.

     j.   Strontium.
           (1) Strontium-90 (90Sr) is a direct fission product (daughter) of uranium. It and
its daughters emit beta and gamma rays and can be an external irradiation hazard if
present in quantity.
          (2) Strontium will follow calcium and is readily absorbed by respiratory and
gastrointestinal routes. Up to a 50 percent dose will be deposited in the bone.
     k.   Thorium-232.
          (1) Thorium-232 is a naturally occurring radioisotope of thorium and is an
alpha emitter.
           (2) When thorium is heated in the air, it glows with a white light. For this
reason, one of the major uses of thorium has been the Welsback™ lantern mantle used in
portable gas lanterns. Thorium-232 is also used in radiac sets AN/VDR-2, AN/PDR-54, and
AN/PDR-77 for use as calibration check sources. Thorium-coated optics are found on many
night vision devices and thermal optic fire control systems. Also, heat-resistant thorium
alloys are used in the combustor liner for the Abrams tank turbine engine and on various
military aircraft engines.
          (3) In general, Thorium-232 presents a minimal hazard, but care should be
taken to avoid internalization of any particles from damaged components or during metal
working activities.
     l.   Tritium.
          (1) Tritium is the heaviest isotope of hydrogen and is a low-energy beta emitter
with a physical half-life of 12 years. Tritium gas rapidly diffuses into the atmosphere.
           (2) It is used in nuclear weapons and muzzle velocity detectors. Tritium is
generally used in devices requiring a light source, such as luminescent gun sights, watches,
compasses, and fire control devices for tanks, mortars, and howitzers.
          (3) Tritium is a beta emitter and is not a significant irradiation hazard.
However, the release of a large amount in a closed space can cause an exposure of clinical
importance. No adverse health effects have been reported from a single exposure.
     m.   Uranium.
           (1) Uranium-235, -238, and -239 (235, 238, and 239U) are found (in order of
increasing radioactivity) in DU, natural uranium, fuel rods, and weapons grade material.
Uranium and its daughters emit alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. DU and natural
uranium are not serious irradiation threats. Used fuel rods and weapons-grade (enriched)
uranium-containing fission products can emit significant levels of gamma. If enough
enriched uranium is placed together, a critical mass may form and emit lethal levels of
radiation. This could be encountered in a fuel-reprocessing plant or melted reactor core.
          (2) Inhaled uranium compounds may be metabolized and excreted in the urine.
Urinary levels of 100 micrograms per deciliter following acute exposure may cause renal
failure.
           (3) Absorption will be determined by the chemical state of the uranium.
Soluble salts are readily absorbed; the metal is not.

WEATHER EFFECTS ON NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL 

       AGENTS AND METEOROLOGICAL REPORTS

1.   Background
     MET reports are used—
     •    As the basis to assess weather data determining if environmental factors are
conducive to enemy employment of CBRN weapons.
     •    In conjunction with plotting tools to predict downwind vapor hazard and fallout
patterns.
     •    To assess the impact of seasonal climate on CBRN weapons effects.
     a.   MET Operations.
           (1) MET operations identify the critical weather information needed to
determine the effects of weather on the use of CBRN weapons. MET operations also
analyze the seasonal or monthly normal variations in weather patterns that might affect
the use of CBRN weapons.
        (2) Intelligence ensures that EDMs and CDMs are passed to subordinate
commands, in coordination with the USAF staff weather officer (SWO).
          (3) The CBRN staff must have close coordination with intelligence and
meteorology personnel.
        (4) The CBRN staff is responsible for CBRN defense at every echelon of
command. It assesses whether environmental factors are conducive to the enemy use of
CBRN weapons.
        (5) The CBRN staff provides input on hazard predictions, increasing the
commander’s SA.
     b.    USN. The Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center provides
wind field data and high-resolution MET data for DTRA CBRN dispersion modeling and
simulation. DTRA supports the DOD hazard assessment planning and contingency
operations. The Naval Oceanography Program will provide MET forecasts as required in
support of CBRN avoidance and consequence management to the USN and joint
commanders.
2.   Weather Effects on Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Agents
     Weather can affect CBRN agents in various ways. In some instances, it can prolong
the presence of agents in the battlespace and, in other instances, it can shorten the time
agents pose a hazard to the warfighter.
      a.   Nuclear. Any condition that significantly affects the visibility or the
transparency of the air affects the transmission of thermal radiation. Clouds, smoke
(including artificial), fog, snow, and rain absorb and scatter thermal energy. Depending on
the concentration, they can stop as much as 90 percent of the thermal energy. On the other



2 February 2006   FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56              D-1
hand, clouds above the burst may reflect additional thermal radiation onto the target that
would have otherwise traveled harmlessly into the sky.
          (1)   Rain.
                 (a) Rain on an area contaminated by a surface burst changes the pattern
of radioactive intensities by washing off higher elevations, buildings, equipment, and
vegetation. This reduces intensities in some areas and, possibly, increases intensities in
drainage systems, on low ground, and in flat or poorly drained areas.
               (b) Rain and fog may lessen the blast wave because energy dissipates by
heating and evaporating the moisture in the atmosphere.
                (c)   Clouds and air density have no significant effects on fallout patterns.
                 (d) Precipitation scavenging can cause the removal of radioactive
particles from the atmosphere; this is known as rainout. Because of the uncertainties
associated with weather predictions, the locations that could receive rainout cannot be
accurately predicted. Rainout may occur in the vicinity of GZ, or the contamination could
be carried aloft for tens of kilometers before deposition. The threat of rainout especially
exists from a surface or subsurface burst. Vast quantities of radioactive debris will be
carried aloft and deposited downwind. However, rainout may cause the fallout area to
increase or decrease and also cause hot spots within the fallout area.
                (e) For airbursts, rainout can increase the residual contamination hazard.
Normally, the only residual hazard from an airburst is a small neutron-induced
contamination area around GZ. However, rainout will cause additional contaminated areas
in unexpected locations.
                (f) Yields of 10 kilotons (kt) or less present the greatest potential for
rainout, and yields of 60 kt or more offer the least. Additionally, yields between 10 kt and
60 kt may produce rainout if the nuclear clouds remain at or below rain cloud height.
          (2)   Wind Speed and Direction.
               (a) Wind speed and direction at various altitudes are two factors that
determine the shape, size, location, and intensity of the fallout pattern on the ground
because contaminated dirt and debris deposit downwind.
                 (b) Surface winds also play an important role in the final location of the
fallout particles. They pile fallout material in drifts, and winds cause localization in the
crevices and ditches and against curbs and ledges. This effect is not locally predictable, but
personnel must be aware of the probability of these highly intense accumulations of
radioactive material occurring and their natural locations.
          (3)   Cold-Weather Operations.
                 (a) Weather conditions limit the number of passable roadways.
Radiological contamination on the roadways may further restrict resupply and troop
movement. Seasonal high winds in the arctic may present a problem in radiological
contamination predictions. These winds may reduce dose rates at GZ. At the same time,
they extend the area coverage and create a problem for survey and monitoring teams. Hot
spots or areas of concentrated accumulation of radiological contamination may also occur in
the areas of heavy snow and snow drifts.




D-2              FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56 2 February 2006
                  (b) At subzero temperatures, the radius of damage to material targets can
increase as much as 20 percent. Blast effects can drastically interfere with troop movement
by breaking up ice covers and causing quick thaws. These effects can cause avalanches in
mountainous areas. In flat lands, the blast may disturb the permafrost to such an extent as
to restrict or disrupt movement.
                (c) The reflecting nature of the surface over which a weapon is detonated
can significantly influence the distance to which blast effects extend. Generally, reflecting
surfaces (such as thin layers of ice, snow, and water) increase the distance to which
overpressures extend.
                 (d) The high reflectivity of ice and snow may increase the minimum safe
distance (MSD) as much as 50 percent for unwarned troops and for warned, exposed troops.
Reflectivity may also increase the number of personnel whose vision is affected by the
brilliant flash or light dazzle especially at night.
                 (e) Cold temperatures also reduce thermal effects on materials. Snow,
ice, and frost coverings on combustible materials greatly reduce the tendency of the
materials to catch fire. However, thermal effects will dry out exposed tundra areas, and
grass fires may result.
          (4)     Mountain Operations.
                (a) The clear mountain air extends the range of casualty-producing
thermal effects. Within this range, however, the added clothing required by the cool
temperatures at high altitudes reduces casualties from these effects.
                 (b) In the mountains, the deposit of radiological contamination will be
very erratic because of the rapidly changing wind patterns. Hot spots may occur far from
the point of detonation, and low intensity areas may occur very near it. Limited mobility
makes radiological surveys on the ground difficult, and the difficulty of maintaining a
constant flight altitude makes air surveys highly inaccurate.
           (5) Desert Operations. Desert operations present many varying problems.
Desert daytime temperatures can vary between 90°F to 125°F (32°C to 52°C). These
temperatures create an unstable temperature gradient. However, with nightfall, the desert
cools rapidly and a stable temperature gradient results. The possibility of a night attack
must be considered in all planning. Blowing winds and sand make widespread radiological
survey patterns likely.
            (6) Jungle Operations. Radiation hazards may be reduced because some of the
falling particles are retained by the jungle canopy. Subsequent rains, however, will wash
these particles to the ground and concentrate them in water collection areas. Radiation hot
spots will result.
     b.   Biological.
           (1) Air Stability. A stable atmosphere results in the greatest cloud
concentration and area coverage of biological agents. Under unstable and neutral stability
conditions, more atmospheric mixing occurs. This leads to a cloud of lower concentration,
but the concentration is sufficient enough to inflict significant casualties. The coverage
area under unstable stability conditions is also reduced. Table D-1, page D-4, provides a
snapshot of how weather effects the biological dissemination.

            (2) Temperature. Air temperature in the surface boundary layer is related to
the amount of sunlight the ground has received. Normal atmospheric temperatures have
little direct effect on the microorganisms of a biological aerosol. Indirectly, however, an
increase in the evaporation rate of the aerosol droplets normally follows a temperature
increase. There is evidence that survival of most pathogens decreases sharply in the range
of minus 20°C to minus 40°C and above 49°C. High temperatures kill most bacteria and
most viral and rickettsial agents. However, these temperatures will seldom, if ever, be
encountered under natural conditions. Subfreezing temperatures tend to quick-freeze the
aerosol after its release, thus decreasing the rate of decay. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV)
light (one form of the sun’s radiation) increases the decay rate of microorganisms. UV light,
therefore, has a destructive effect upon biological aerosol. Most toxins are more stable than
pathogens and are less susceptible to the influence of temperature.
           (3) Relative Humidity. The relative humidity level favoring employment of a
biological agent aerosol depends on whether the aerosol is distributed wet or dry. For a wet
aerosol, a high relative humidity retards evaporation of the tiny droplets containing the
microorganisms. This decreases the decay rate of wet agents, as drying results in the death
of these microorganisms. On the other hand, a low relative humidity is favorable for the
employment of dry agents. When the humidity is high, the additional moisture in the air
may increase the decay rate of the microorganisms of the dry aerosol. This is because
moisture speeds up the life cycle of the microorganisms. Most toxins are more stable than
pathogens and are less susceptible to the influence of relative humidity.
           (4) Pollutants. Atmospheric pollutant gases can also affect the survival of
pathogens. Pollutant gases have been found to decrease the survival of many pathogens.
These gases include nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide. This
could be a significant factor in the battlefield where the air is often polluted.
           (5) Cloud Coverage. Cloud coverage in an area influences the amount of solar
radiation received by aerosol. Thus, clouds decrease the amount of destructive UV light
that the microorganisms receive. Cloud coverage also influences factors such as ground
temperature and relative humidity.
           (6) Precipitation. Precipitation may wash suspended particles from the air.
This washout may be significant in a heavy rainstorm but minimal at other times. High
relative humidity associated with mist, drizzle, or very light rain is also an important

factor. Humidity may be favorable or unfavorable, depending on the type of agent. The low
temperatures associated with ice, snow, and other winter precipitation prolong the life of
most biological agents.
     c.   Chemical. Adversaries will seek to employ chemical agents under favorable
weather conditions, if possible, to increase their effectiveness. Table D-2 provides an
overview of how weather effects aerosolized chemical agents.

          (1) Atmospheric Stability. One of the key factors in using chemical weapons is
the determination of the atmospheric stability condition that will exist at the time of attack.
This determination can be made from a MET report or by observing field conditions.
                (a) Unstable conditions (such as many rising and falling air currents and
great turbulence) quickly disperse chemical agents. Unstable is the least favorable
condition for chemical agent use because it results in a lower concentration, thereby
reducing the area affected by the agent. Many more munitions are required to attain the
commander’s objectives under unstable conditions than under stable or neutral conditions.
                 (b) Stable conditions (such as low wind speeds and slight turbulence)
produce the highest concentrations. Chemical agents remain near the ground and may
travel for long distances before being dissipated. Stable conditions encourage the agent
cloud to remain intact, thus allowing it to cover extremely large areas without diffusion.
However, the direction and extent of cloud travel under stable conditions are not
predictable if there are no dependable local wind data. A very stable condition is the most
favorable for achieving a high concentration from a chemical cloud being dispersed.
                (c) Neutral conditions are moderately favorable. With low wind speed
and smooth terrain, large areas may be effectively covered. The neutral condition occurs at
dawn and sunset and generally is the most predictable. For this reason, a neutral
dispersion category is often best from a military standpoint.
              (2)   Vapor Concentration and Diffusion.
                (a) Agent concentration is governed by the volume of the agent cloud.
Since clouds continually expand, agent concentration levels decrease over time. Wind speed
determines the downwind growth of the cloud. Vertical and horizontal turbulence
determines the height and width of the cloud. The rate at which the downwind, vertical,
and horizontal components expand governs the cloud volume and the agent concentration.
                 (b) To be effective at a specific concentration level, the agent cloud must
remain in the target area for a definite period. Wind in the target area mixes the agent and
distributes it over the target after release. For ground targets, high concentrations and
good coverage can best be achieved with low turbulence and calm winds when the agent is



2 February 2006     FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                 D-5
delivered directly on target. A steady, predictable wind drift over the target is best when
the agent is delivered on the upwind side of the target. Conditions other than these tend to
produce lower concentrations and poorer target coverage. However, unless the weather
conditions are known within the target area, the effects of the agent on the target will be
approximations.
                (c) The concentration and diffusion of a chemical-agent cloud are also
influenced by the following:
                 •    Hydrolysis is a process in which (chemical) compounds decompose and
split into other compounds by taking up the elements of water. Chemical agents with high
hydrolysis rates are less effective under high-humidity conditions.
                 •     Absorption is the process of the agent being taken into the vegetation,
skin, soil, or material. Adsorption is the adding of a thin layer of agent to vegetation or
other surfaces. This is important in dense vegetation. Absorption and adsorption of
chemical agents may kill vegetation, thus defoliating the area of employment.
                 •    Shifting air currents and horizontal turbulence blow a chemical cloud
from side to side. The side-to-side motion of the air is called meandering. While the agent
cloud meanders, it also spreads laterally. Lateral spreading is called lateral diffusion. In
unstable conditions, the lateral spread tends to be greater than in stable conditions.
                 •    Wind currents carry chemical clouds along the ground with a rolling
motion. This is caused by the differences in wind velocity. Wind speeds increase rapidly
from near zero at the ground to higher speeds at higher elevations aboveground. The drag
effect by the ground, together with the interference of vegetation and other ground objects,
causes the base of an agent cloud to be retarded as the cloud stretches out in length. When
clouds are released on the ground, the drag amounts to about 10 percent of the vertical
growth over distance traveled on grass, plowed land, or water. It amounts to about 20
percent over gently rolling terrain covered with bushes, growing crops, or small patches of
scattered timber. In heavy woods, the drag effect is greatly increased.
                 •     Wind speeds can vary at different heights. The wind direction can
also change with an increase in height; this is known as wind shear. Because of wind
shear, a puff (or chemical cloud) may become stretched in the downwind direction and may
travel in a direction different from that of the surface wind. Additionally, a chemical cloud
released in the air may be carried along faster than it can diffuse downward. As a result,
air near the ground on the forward edge of the cloud may be uncontaminated while the air a
few feet up may be heavily contaminated. This layering effect becomes more pronounced
and increases proportionately with the distance of the forward edge of the cloud from the
source.
                 •    The vertical rise of a chemical cloud depends on the weather variables
(such as temperature gradient, wind speed, and turbulence) and the difference between the
densities of the clouds and the surrounding air. As mentioned earlier, the temperature of
the cloud and the air influences their relative densities. Hotter gases are less dense and,
therefore, lighter than cooler gases and air. Therefore, they rise until they are mixed and
somewhat diluted and then attain the same temperature and approximately the same
density as the surrounding air.




D-6              FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56 2 February 2006
                 •     The vapor cloud formed by an agent normally employed for a
persistent effect rises in a similar manner, but vapor concentrations build up more
gradually.
           (3)   Wind.
                 (a) High wind speeds cause rapid dispersion of vapors or aerosols, thereby
decreasing the effective coverage of the target area and the time of exposure to the agent. In
high winds, larger quantities of munitions are required to ensure the effective
concentrations. Agent clouds are most effective when wind speeds are less than 4 knots and
steady in direction. The clouds move with the prevailing wind as altered by terrain and
vegetation. Steady, low wind (speeds of 3 to 7 knots) enhances the coverage area unless an
unstable condition exists. With high winds, chemical agents cannot be economically
employed to achieve casualties.
                (b) The evaporation of liquid agents due to wind speed depends on the
amount of the liquid exposed to the wind (the surface of the liquid) and the rate that the air
passes over the agent. Therefore, the duration of effectiveness is longer at the places of
greater liquid-agent contamination and in places where the liquid agent is sheltered from
the wind.
                 (c) The evaporation rate of agents employed for persistent effect in a
liquid state is proportional to the wind speed. If the speed increases, evaporation increases,
thus shortening the duration of the effective contamination. Increased evaporation, in turn,
creates a larger vapor cloud. The vapor cloud is dispersed by higher winds. The creation
and dispersion of the vapor is a continuous process, increasing or decreasing in proportion
to the wind speed.
          (4) Temperature. There will be increased vaporization with higher
temperatures. Also, the rate of evaporation of any remaining liquid agent from an exploding
munition can vary with the temperature.
           (5) Humidity. Humidity is the measure of the water vapor content in the air.
Hydrolysis is a process where compounds react to chemical change with water, resulting in
chemical agents with high hydrolysis. Rates are less effective under conditions of high
humidity. Humidity has little effect on most chemical-agent clouds. Some agents (phosgene
and lewisite) hydrolyze quite readily. Hydrolysis causes these chemical agents to break
down and change their chemical characteristics. If the relative humidity exceeds
70 percent, phosgene and lewisite cannot be employed effectively except for a surprise
time-on-target attack because of rapid hydrolysis. Lewisite hydrolysis by-products are not
dangerous to the skin; however, they are toxic if taken internally because of the arsenic
content. The riot control agent CS also hydrolyzes, although slowly, in high humidity. High
humidity combined with high temperatures may increase the effectiveness of some agents
because of body perspiration that will absorb the agents and allow for better transfer.
           (6)   Precipitation.
                (a) The overall effect of precipitation is unfavorable because it is
extremely effective in washing chemical vapors and aerosols from the air, vegetation, and
material. Weather forecasts or observations indicating the presence of, or potential for,
precipitation present an unfavorable environment for the employment of chemical agents.
However, light rains distribute persistent agents more evenly over a large surface. Since

more liquid is then exposed to the air, the rate of evaporation may increase and cause
higher vapor concentrations. Precipitation also accelerates the hydrolysis effect. Heavy rain
or rain of a long duration tends to wash away liquid chemical agents. These agents may
then collect in areas previously uncontaminated (such as stream beds and depressions) and
present an unplanned contamination hazard.
                 (b) The evaporation rate of a liquid agent reduces when the agent is
covered with water, but returns to normal when the water is gone. Precipitation may bring
some persistent agents back to the surface as contact hazards that have previously lost
their contact effectiveness by soaking into the soil or other porous surfaces.
                (c) Snow acts as a blanket, covering the liquid contaminant. It lowers the
surface temperature and slows evaporation so that only very low vapor concentrations form.
When the snow melts, the danger of the contamination reappears; however, hydrolysis may
reduce its operational effectiveness.
3.    Overview of Meteorological Reports
      Weather reporting must be thoroughly integrated into the CBRNWRS.
      a.   BWR.
           (1) The BWR provides information on the wind conditions (i.e., wind direction
and wind speed) in a number of layers from the surface of the earth to 30,000 meters (m)
altitude. Each layer has a thickness of 2,000 m.
          (2) The NBC BWR is an ADP-formatted message used to accommodate the two
types of BWRs.
                  (a) The BWM provides wind directions and speeds at various elevations
for an initial 6-hour period based on actual weather data.
                (b) The BWF provides wind directions and speeds for a subsequent 6-hour
period based on predicted data.
           (3) Within each of the two types of BWRs, the message always begins with
information on the wind conditions within the lowest layer first (from the surface to 2,000
m), then for the 2,000- to 4,000-m layer, etc. A numerical identifier is used for each of the
layers, beginning with 2 for the 0 m–2,000 m layer, 4 for the 2,000 m–4,000 m layer, etc.
      b.   EDR.
           (1) The EDR is used to provide the effective downwind data needed to predict a
fallout area following a nuclear burst. Seven downwind speeds and downwind directions
(toward which the wind is blowing) are transmitted within each EDR, corresponding to
seven preselected weapon yield groups.
          (2) The NBC EDR is an ADP-formatted message used to accommodate two
types of EDRs.
                (a) The EDM provides downwind speeds and directions for the selected
seven yield groups during an initial 6-hour period.
               (b) The EDF provides wind directions and speeds for selected yield groups
for a subsequent 6-hour period.

           (3) Special Case. When the effective downwind speed is less than 8 kilometers
per hour (kph), the predicted fallout area will be circular and the radii of two concentric
circles around GZ will be equal to the Zone I downwind distance and the Zone II downwind
distance, respectively.
     c.      CDR.
           (1) A CDR contains basic MET information for predicting biological aerosol or
chemical vapor hazard areas. These reports are also used for ROTA incidents where Type
T, TIM, Case 2, RDD, Case 3, biological bunker or production facility, or Case 4, chemical
stockpile or TIM transport/storage are involved.
          (2) The NBC CDR is an ADP-formatted message used to accommodate two
types of CDRs.
                   (a)    The CDM provides required weather information during an initial
6-hour period.
                   (b)    The CDF provides required weather information for a subsequent
6-hour period.
          (3) These reports are prepared by corps and division CBRN cells from
information obtained through the assigned weather support element (USAF Air Weather
Service [AWS], SWO, or Naval Oceanography Program representative).
           (4) The CDR is transmitted at least four times a day, and each message is valid
for a 6-hour period. Each 6-hour period is subdivided into three 2-hour subperiods.
      d.    MET Report Fields. Tables D-3 and D-4 (page D-10) provide fields and lines used
in the different MET reports.

4. 	 Basic Wind Reports (Details and Examples)
          This paragraph details how to effectively create and use BWRs.

       a. BWRs. As described previously, the BWR is an ADP-formatted message used to
accommodate the two types of BWRs—the BWM based on actual weather data, and the
BWF based on predicted data. It provides wind conditions (direction and speed) in 2,000­
meter intervals from the surface of the earth to 30,000 meters.
          b. Wind Vector Plot.
           (1) The information contained in the BWM is used for the construction of a
wind vector plot. The BWM is converted into downwind directions for each layer of height
by reversing the wind direction by 180 degrees.
           (2) The wind speed of each layer, as given in the BWM, is represented by a
vector, the length of which is extracted from the appropriate table. Tables D-5 through D-10
(pages D-22 through D-24) give the vector length in centimeters for different scale maps
listed in kph and knots. Ensure that the correct map size and wind speed are selected.
NOTE: Above 18,000 meters, altitude layers for plotting vector diagrams continue
at 2,000-meter intervals; however, since the map distance factors vary so little,
some of the columns in the following tables have been combined for convenience.

           (3) From GZ, draw a vector in the downwind direction of the layer 0–2,000
meters. Label the downwind end of the vector with the label 2, and label the vector length
alongside the vector. The vector now represents the downwind direction and the downwind
speed within the height layer from the surface to 2,000 meters.

           (4) From the end of the first vector, draw the next vector. The downwind end of
this vector is labeled 4, so the vector represents the downwind direction and downwind

NOTE: Unless otherwise annotated, winds are taken “from” not in the direction
“to”; therefore, the back azimuth must be taken (more than 180°, subtract 180; less
than 180°, add 180). If the windspeed is provided in kph rather than knots per
hour, then multiply by 0.54 (see Tables D-11 and D-12, page D-27).

5.   Effective Downwind Reports (Details and Example)
     The EDR is used to provide the effective downwind data needed to predict a fallout
area following a nuclear burst for the nearest 6-hour period (EDR) or for a period more than
6 hours ahead (EDF). Seven downwind speeds and corresponding downwind directions are
transmitted in the EDM, corresponding to seven preselected weapon yield groups.

      a.   Since effective downwind speed and effective downwind direction vary with the
yield, seven downwind speeds and downwind directions are transmitted, corresponding to
seven preselected yield groups, ALFA through GOLF as follows:
       ALFAM        is     ≤      2 KT 

       BRAVOM       is     >      2 KT          ≤      5 KT 

       CHARLIEM     is     >      5 KT          ≤      30 KT 

       DELTAM       is     >      30 KT         ≤      100 KT 

       ECHOM        is     >      100 KT        ≤      300 KT 

       FOXTROTM     is     >      300 KT        ≤      1,000 KT (1 MT)    

       GOLFM        is     >      1,000 KT      ≤      3,000 KT (3 MT)    

     b.  To calculate the data, use the following procedure with 2 KT for ALFAM, 5 KT
for BRAVOM, and 30 KT for CHARLIEM and so on.
        (1) Step 1. Army users may obtain a blank DA Form 1971-3-R, Effective
Downwind Message Worksheet, located in Appendix L (see Figure D-2).

           (2) Step 2. Place a sheet of overlay paper over the wind vector plot, and mark a
GN reference line and GZ. Mark the cloud top height, cloud bottom height, and 2/3 stem
height for the 2 KT yield. Draw radial lines from GZ through these three points (see Figure
D-3).




                                           2/3 Stem 1.7 km


                                                  CT 4.9 km
                       CB 2.6 km




            Figure D-3. Wind Vector Plot with Cloud and Stem Radial Lines (2 KT)

            (3) Step 3. To determine the effective wind speed (sss), measure the distance
along the cloud bottom radial line from GZ to its intersection with the wind vector plot at
the cloud bottom height point. Multiply as indicated on the EDM work sheet. Round each
result to the nearest kilometer (km) (28.4 km = 28, 28.5 km = 29 km).
NOTE: A situation may arise when the effective wind speed for one or more yield
groups is less than 8 kph. In this case the downwind distance for Zone I is
determined using a nomogram in Appendix J. Enter the nomogram with the
effective wind speed of 8 kph on the left-hand scale and the highest yield for each



2 February 2006   FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56              D-29
yield group on the right-hand scale. Then, read the downwind distance for Zone I
on the center scale.
            (4) Step 4. To determine the effective downwind direction, use a protractor and
measure the azimuth from GZ to cloud top and the azimuth from GZ to 2/3 stem. Add these
two measurements, and divide by 2. This is known as bisecting the angles. The result of
this bisection is the effective downwind direction (ddd).
NOTE: When the GZ and/or the cloud top radial line or the GZ and/or the 2/3 stem
radial line fall in the first quadrant (0 to 90) and the other radial line falls in the
fourth quadrant (270 to 360), the result of adding the GZ/cloud top azimuth and
the GZ and/or 2/3 stem azimuth divided by 2 will be the back azimuth of the ddd.
In this case, determine ddd by the following method: If the total is greater than
180°, subtract 180°; if the total is less than 180°; add 180° and enter the ddd in the
EDM.
          (5) Step 5. Measure the angle between the cloud top and 2/3 stem. If the angle
exceeds 40°, report the actual angle measured in the "Warning Area Angle" column of the
EDM. If the angle measured is an odd number, round the angle to the next highest even
number.
          (6) Step 6. Repeat Steps 2 through 5 for the remaining yield groups. Use a
separate sheet of overlay paper for each yield group.
           (7) Step 7. Complete the EDM portion of the work sheet based on the data and
calculations. Remember the 3-6-9 rule:
            •    3 digits mean winds less than 8 kph, and digits represent the Zone I
distance.
            •    6 digits mean normal message.
            •    9 digits mean expanded radial lines to a given number of degrees.
NOTE: For ADP EDM reports the expanded angle special case will only contain
seven digits versus nine. For example if the EDM line reads CHARLIEM/­
/310/015/6/, the “6” represents an angle of 60°. See paragraph 5c below.
       c.   Special Cases.
           (1) When the effective wind speed is less than 8 kph for a given yield group, the
applicable line will contain only three digits. These three digits will represent the radial
line distance of Zone I. In this case, no wind speed is given and the fallout pattern will be
two concentric circles.
            (2) Another special case occurs when the fallout is not expected to fall within
the normal 40° angle of the prediction. In this case, the appropriate line on the EDM has
nine digits. The first six digits represent wind direction and wind speed. The last three
digits will be the angle in degrees between the left and right radial lines.
           (3) The simplified procedure does not normally provide for a warning angle
greater then 40°. In the instances where the detailed procedure demands an angle greater
then 40°, this warning area is given in the EDM to subordinate units to expand their
original warning area. The 40° standard angle between the two radial lines must be
expanded in equal degrees on each side of the reference line.

6.   Chemical Downwind Reports (Details and Example)
     This paragraph details how to effectively prepare and use CDRs.
     a. General Preparation. A CDR contains basic MET information for predicting
biological aerosol and chemical vapor hazard areas. These reports are also used for a ROTA
incident. Biological agents will generally remain toxic through multiple changes in MET
conditions and multiple CB MET reports.
          (1) The CDR is prepared by corps and division CBRN staffs (or service
equivalent) from information obtained through the USAF AWS, SWO, or Naval
Oceanography Program. The CDR is transmitted at least four times a day, and each
message is valid for a 6-hour period. Each 6-hour period is subdivided into three 2-hour
periods.
          (2) The NBC CDR is an ADP-formatted message that is used to accommodate
the CDM which provides the required weather information during an initial 6-hour period
or the CDF which provides required weather information for subsequent 6-hour periods.
The following is a sample CDM:

          (3) The first step in preparing the CDM is to acquire the weather data.
Weather information can also be obtained from the artillery MET section. Although the
MET section cannot provide forecasts, it can provide current weather information.
           (4) The next step is to break the information down into three consecutive
2-hour increments. WHISKEYM is used for the first 2-hour increment, XRAYM for the
second, and YANKEEM for the final 2-hour increment. Then, the CBRN cell translates this
data into codes and puts it in the proper format. Each forecast line contains 12 digits.
            (5) The first six digits represent the downwind direction and wind speed. The
last six digits represent the air stability, temperature, humidity, significant weather
phenomena, and cloud cover. Weather data which is unavailable or for which no code exists
is represented by a dash.
       b.    CDM Preparations Without Weather Service Support. A valid CDM may not
always be available from the corps or division CBRN cell or applicable to the unit AO. Units
may estimate the air stability category by observing local MET conditions. A field-expedient
method of obtaining the necessary weather data may be used when all other sources are
unavailable. In order to obtain local weather data, units may obtain a belt weather kit
(National Stock Number [NSN] 6660-01-024-2638) and barometer (NSN 660-00-551-3998).
The weather information obtained in this manner is only for that particular area, for that
period of time. It is by no means a forecast from which a CDM may be produced. However,
it is a local method of verifying CDM weather data. If this method is used for local weather,
include this data on the NBC1 chemical report.
           (1) Step 1. Measure the wind speed and direction with the lensatic compass
and ananometer. Use the highest wind speed recorded. Take the temperature and
humidity readings using the wet bulb at 1 meter aboveground. Obtain readings every 2
hours if practical, but not greater than 4 hours.
            (2) Step 2. Determine the four transition periods of wind speed and direction
during the day. Take the average of the readings during each transition period. The most
difficult aspect is determining the sun by observation. Since most units do not have
equipment to do this, make the best estimation possible. (Example: It is morning. The
sun’s angle is 45°, and the sky is less than half covered. Find the time of day [morning] and
the angle of the sun [45°] in Table D-13. Find the sky condition [less than half-covered].
Read across and down to the point where the lines converge. The air stability category is
U.)

           (3) Atmospheric Stability Charts. The stability of a CB agent cloud is directly
affected by the temperature of the air at the surface of the earth and the first few meters
above the surface.
           (4) Temperature Gradients. The air stability categories are dependent on the
temperature gradient (difference of air temperature at two altitudes). The temperature
gradient is determined by measuring the air temperature at two different altitudes.
Compare the differences in air temperature to the normal or expected change in
temperature. The normal change in temperature is 1° cooler for every 100 meters increase
in altitude. The four possible gradient conditions are inversion, neutral, lapse, and elevated
inversion.
                 (a) Inversion Temperature Gradient (Stable). If air at the higher altitude
is warmer than the normal temperature at the lower altitude, the air will not move
vertically. This represents an inversion temperature gradient. This condition usually
exists on a clear night when middle and low clouds cover less than 30 percent of the sky and
on early mornings until about 1 hour after sunrise when the wind speed is less than 5
knots. It is characterized by a minimum of convection currents and by maximum air
stability, which is ideal for enemy employment of chemical agents. Weak inversion
conditions tend to prevail during the day over large bodies of water.
                (b) Neutral Temperature Gradient (Neutral). A neutral condition exists
when the air temperature shows very little or no change with air increase in altitude. This
represents the neutral temperature gradient. This condition usually exists on heavily
overcast days or nights, at 1 or 2 hours before sunset or 1 to 2 hours after sunrise, when the
middle and low clouds cover more than 30 percent of the sky. Independent of cloud cover
and the time of day, a neutral condition may also exist when the wind speed is greater than
5 knots. Additionally, periods of precipitation are normally accompanied by a neutral
condition. A neutral temperature gradient is most favorable for enemy use of biological
agents because the associated wind speeds result in larger area coverage.




2 February 2006    FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                 D-33
                 (c) Lapse Temperature Gradient (Unstable). If the air at the higher
altitude is cooler than the expected difference, there will be vertical movement of air
creating turbulence. This condition normally exists on a clear day, when the middle and
low clouds cover less than 30 percent of the sky and when the wind speed is less than 5
knots. This is the least favorable condition for the enemy to employ CB agents. Over large
bodies of water, weak lapse conditions tend to prevail at night. When a lapse condition
exists, area coverage without diffusion will be enhanced with a steady low wind speed of 3
to 7 knots.
                  (d)   Elevated Inversion (Stable).
                 •    Elevated inversion may occur when cooler air settles under warmer
air. This condition will generally occur when a warm and cold frontal system converge over
a large body of water. Elevated inversions also occur when the stable boundary layer
formed overnight weakens in the morning as the sun heats the surface. The significance of
an elevated inversion layer is that the layer will act as a lid over the surface. This lid traps
air particulants and chemical agents at a given height aboveground, thus presenting an
increased threat to aircrews. The SWO must report this condition to the CBRN and
divisional aviation units when it occurs.
                 •    Once the air stability category has been obtained from Table D-13
(page D-33), enter the adjustment chart (Table D-14) with that category. Select the
appropriate weather and terrain condition. Read across to where they intersect, and
extract the final stability category. Use this stability category to determine the maximum
downwind distance.

      c.    Naval CDM. The Naval CDM is essentially computed in the same manner as the
land CDM. In most cases, the CDM information is obtained through land-based CBRN
centers. However, in the event that land CDM information is not available or differs
significantly from the weather conditions at sea, Figure D-4 can be used to determine the
stability category. The numbers 1 through 7 depicted on the graph correspond to the seven
stability categories used in the land CDM. The seven stability categories indicated on
Figure D-4 are as follows:
       •    1—Very unstable.
       •    2—Unstable.
       •    3—Slightly unstable.
       •    4—Neutral.

         CHEMICAL-CONTAMINATION AVOIDANCE TACTICS, 

                TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES


1.   Background
     a.    The CBRN cell staff monitors and tracks all CBRN information within the
AO. The commander, CBRN cell, and medical and intelligence sections make
decisions that rely on the SA and the significance of gathered data. The commander
and staff apply the information from intelligence, medical, and surveillance systems
to support the following:
     •     Hazard predictions.
     •     Warning, reporting, and notification.
     •     Casualty prevention.
     •     Casualty management.
      b.    Units obtain relevant data from multiple sources (such as, sensors,
detectors, observers, and medical staffs). The applicable NBC chemical (CHEM)
report data is processed, extracted, formatted, and forwarded. The commanders and
their staff evaluate the information to assess any impact on operations. Risk
assessment is part of the decision-making process and may result in directives or
orders to help reduce the impact of the assessed hazards. The commanders may
direct an integrated series of protective or avoidance measures to decrease the level
of risk (decrease exposure opportunities) or reduce the effects of exposure. Because
SA is an ongoing process, the plan is revised as updated information is received.
2.   Chemical-Contamination Avoidance Procedures
     Avoidance procedures are broken down into preattack, during attack, and
postattack. The lists given below, while not all-encompassing, will assist in
developing unit SOPs and directives.
     a.    Before the Attack.
           (1)    Subordinate units are alerted.
          (2) Commanders specify the appropriate MOPP levels, establish
automatic masking criteria, and if MOPP0 is assumed, determine the location for
chemical protective clothing based on METT-TC.
          (3) The unit continues the mission while implementing actions to
minimize casualties and damage.
                (a) Personnel, equipment, munitions, POL, food, and water are
protected from contamination.
                (b) Detection paper is placed to provide visibility and maximum
exposure to liquid agents.

               (c) OPSEC, dispersion, cover, and concealment are practiced so
that the unit may avoid being targeted.
                  (d)   Chemical detectors and alarms are checked and prepared for
use.
                  (e)   Updated CDMs are prepared for each unit
            (f) (Shipboard) Countermeasure wash-down system, shipboard
ACADA, and AN/KAS-1A CW directional detector are activated as appropriate.
       b.   During the Attack.
         (1) All personnel automatically mask, sound the alarm, decontaminate
themselves as required, assume MOPP4, and administer self-aid and buddy aid.
           (2) The chain of command and communications are restored, and the
unit continues with the mission.
          (3) Adjacent units are immediately warned of the potential downwind
vapor hazards.
           (4) The unit identifies the type of agent and submits an NBC1 CHEM
report as the mission permits.
           (5) The unit performs the following actions for attacks that leave liquid
or solid contamination on the equipment, personnel, or terrain:
                  (a)   Conduct personal wipe-down and operator’s spray-down or
wipe-down.
                (b) Warn the casualty evacuation section of contaminated
casualties. Personnel killed in action are wrapped and marked.
                  (c)   Mark the contaminated area, and relocate to a clean area if the
mission allows.
                (d) Determine where and when further decontamination can be
accomplished, if necessary.
                (e) Coordinate for decontamination, and resupply protective
clothing and decontaminants.
              (f) Ensure that contaminated battledress overgarments are
exchanged within 24 hours after being contaminated.
                  (g)   Replace contaminated protective covers within 24 hours.
                  (h)   Conduct unmasking procedures for nonpersistent agents.
                  (i)   Treat casualties, and prepare for evacuation as the mission
permits.
                (j) Receive the NBC2 CHEM report, plot the potential hazard
area, and inform the commander.
       c.   After the Attack.
          (1) The unit has undergone decontamination operations, and casualties
have been evacuated.


E-2                FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56 2 February 2006
            (2) The unit reorders chemical defense equipment (i.e., MOPP suits,
filters, and M291 refill kits).
           (3) Continue the effort to identify the agent if the unit has not yet
identified what agent was used. This will be done by—
           •    Using the M256A1 Kit.
           •    Using the ICAM.
           •    Using the ACADA.
           •    Taking samples and forwarding them to the area lab for analysis.
          (4) Perform the following if the unit must continue to operate in or
occupy the contaminated area:
          •    Continue efforts to refine the contamination hazard area and extent
by continued sampling and detection.
           •    Adjust or improve MOPP as required.
           •    Mark contaminated areas, and identify “hot spots.”
         •    Monitor contamination decay or covering to determine when natural
decay may render the area safe.
            •     Be alert for “transient contamination” and the spread or movement
of contamination by natural sources (i.e., wind, rain, runoff, rivers) or human
sources, (i.e., vehicle traffic, rotor wash).
3.   NBC1 CHEM Report
      The NBC1 CHEM report is the most widely used report. The observing unit
uses this report to provide chemical attack data. All units must be completely
familiar with the NBC1 CHEM report format and the information needed to
complete the report. This report is prepared at the unit level quickly and accurately
and then sent to the next higher HQ. NBC1 CHEM reports are not routinely passed
to corps or higher CBRN cells except for the initial-use report. Line items BRAVO
(location of observer), DELTA (DTG), GOLF (means of delivery), INDIA (release
information), and TANGO (terrain, topography, and vegetation description) are
mandatory entries in the NBC1 CHEM report.
          a.    Precedence. The precedence of the NBC1 CHEM report depends on
whether or not it is an initial report. The initial use of a CBRN weapon report is
FLASH precedence; all others are IMMEDIATE precedence.
            b.    Report Preparation. Individuals identified by the unit SOP submit
raw data to the unit CBRN defense team. NBC1 format should be used; however, a
size, activity, location, unit, time, and equipment (SALUTE) or spot report may also
be used and should be submitted to the unit CBRN defense team. The unit CBRN
defense team normally consists of individuals who have been trained in CBRN
defense. This ensures that the report is in the proper format and is as correct as
possible.
           c.  Sample. A sample NBC1 CHEM report is shown in Figure E-1, page
E-4). The column “Cond” indicates the means operationally determined (O) or

4.     NBC2 CHEM Report
     The NBC2 CHEM report is based on one or more NBC1 CHEM reports. It is
used to pass evaluated data to higher, subordinate, and adjacent units.
     a.    When actual attack areas are reported, it is easy to differentiate between
attacks by their locations. When estimated attack areas are reported, the CBRN
specialist uses the following sets to differentiate attacks:
       •     Set BRAVO: Location of the observer and direction of the attack.
       •     Set GOLF: Delivery means and quantity.
       •     Set INDIA: Release information.
     b.    Using the sets above, the CBRN specialist can determine whether the
attacks occurred in the same proximity, whether the means of delivery/quantity
were identical or similar (taking into account the fog of war), agent likeness, air or
ground burst, and liquid or vapor.
     c.    The CBRN cell prepares the NBC2 CHEM report, assigns it a strike serial
number, and disseminates it to the appropriate units. Each subordinate unit then
decides whether to disseminate the report further. Line items ALFA (strike serial
number), DELTA (DTG), FOXTROT (location of attack), GOLF (means of delivery),
INDIA (release information), and TANGO (terrain, topography, and vegetation
description) are mandatory entries in the NBC2 CHEM report. A sample NBC2
CHEM report is shown in Figure E-2.

5.     NBC3 CHEM Report
      The NBC2 CHEM report and current wind information are used to predict the
area of hazard. This prediction is disseminated as an NBC3 CHEM report, which is
sent to all units or activities that could be affected by the hazard. Each unit or
activity prepares a plot of the NBC3 CHEM report, determines which of its
subordinate units or activities are affected, and warns them accordingly.
Commanders should use this report as battlefield intelligence when planning
missions. The NBC3 CHEM report is a prediction of the hazard area. This prediction
is safe-sided to ensure that a significant hazard will not exist outside the predicted
hazard area. Units within the hazard area must adjust their MOPP level as
necessary. They must ensure that chemical-agent alarms are placed far enough
upwind to provide adequate warning. A sample NBC3 CHEM report is shown in
Figure E-3.

30 April 2009     FM 3-11.3/MCWP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56, C1                 E-5
      a.   Chemical Contamination Prediction and Plotting. The chemical prediction
procedure for land provides information on the location and extent of the hazard
area and the duration of the hazard resulting from attacks with chemical weapons.
It provides the necessary information for commanders to warn units within the
predicted hazard area. In general, the predicted hazard area will be dependent on
the type of attack, the means of delivery, and MET factors in the attack area.
      b.   Definitions Used in Chemical Hazard Predictions.
           (1) Attack Area. This is the predicted area immediately affected by the
delivered chemical agent.
           (2) Hazard Area. This is the predicted area in which unprotected
personnel may be affected by vapor spreading downwind from the attack area. The
downwind distance depends on the type of attack, the weather, and the terrain in
the attack area and the area downwind of the attack area.
          (3) Contaminated Area. This is the area in which liquid hazard may
remain for some time after the attack. The actual shape and duration can only be
determined by surveys.
NOTE: If actual surveys alter the initial data used for the determination of
the attack, the NBC2 and NBC3 CHEM reports must be changed or
updated.
     c.     Types of Chemical Attacks. Chemical attacks can be divided into three
types, as follows:
           (1) Type A: Air-Contaminating attacks (nonpersistent agents). Type A
attacks are to be assumed unless liquid is present that is subsequently confirmed to
be a persistent agent.
           (2)   Type B: Ground-contaminating attacks (persistent agents).
           (3)   Type C: Attack origin unknown.
      d.   Means of Delivery.
           (1)   The means of delivery and types of agent containers are listed in
Table III-2.
     e.   Prediction of the Downwind Hazard. After an attack by chemical agents,
personnel may encounter three types of hazards—liquid, vapor, or liquid and
vapor—depending on their position relative to the attack area.
          (1) Liquid Hazard. Personnel in an area contaminated with liquid
chemical agents will be exposed to a hazard that varies according to—
                 (a)   The type and amount of agent disseminated.
                 (b)   The method of dissemination.
                 (c)   The local climatic conditions.
                 (d)   The nature of the terrain.

                  (e)     The time lapse after the contamination.

          Liquid agents may completely stop evaporating and result in an all-clear
survey under very cold conditions. A hazard can be recreated when temperatures
rise.

          (2) Nonpersistent Agents. Most nonpersistent agents are disseminated
mainly as vapor, but some of the agent types may leave residual liquid in shell or
bomb craters for hours or days depending on the climatic conditions and munition
type. Craters should be avoided until tests have proven the absence of a liquid
hazard.
           (3) Persistent Agents. Persistent agents are disseminated as liquid and
present a vapor and contact hazards. This hazard will last for several hours to days
depending on the terrain, climatic conditions, and munition type.
           (4) Border Areas. Some agents, normally classified as nonpersistent,
may behave as persistent agents in very cold environments, and liquid from
nonpersistent and persistent agents may freeze at low temperatures (e.g., HD
freezes at temperatures below 14°C) and can present a delayed hazard to personnel
when the temperature rises.
           (5) Thickened, Nonpersistent Agents. Thickened, nonpersistent agents
may have to be treated as persistent, ground-contaminating agents. Blister agents
are normally classified as persistent agents and will be indicated as such when
detected by three-way detector paper. Some ground-contaminating agents, however,
are very volatile and should be treated as nonpersistent.
            (6) Vapor Hazard. All chemical agents present a vapor or aerosol hazard
to personnel downwind of the attack area. The area covered by this hazard may be
estimated by using prediction techniques. The actual downwind distance covered by
a toxic cloud will depend on the type and amount of agent disseminated, method of
dissemination, climatic conditions, and terrain.
      f.   Attack Chronology.
           (1) The dimensions of the downwind hazard area will depend on the
means of delivery, category of agent, type of attack, weather, and terrain. The cloud
arrival time at positions downwind of the attack point or area will depend on the
representative downwind speed.
           (2) The ability to provide a timely warning to personnel downwind of
the point or area of attack will depend on the time taken to learn of the attack, the
time taken to predict a downwind hazard area, and the time required to transmit
the warning to those in the hazard area.
      g.   Principles of Chemical Predictions and Limitations.
           (1) Unprotected personnel in an attack area will be exposed to chemical-
agent hazards unless they take immediate protective action at the first indication of
an attack. It is assumed that once chemical warfare has been initiated, troops in
areas attacked by aircraft or missiles or coming under artillery or other
bombardment will immediately and automatically carry out appropriate chemical
defense tactics whether or not a chemical alarm has been given.
          (2) An attacked unit will attempt to warn all friendly forces in the
immediate vicinity, using the procedures described in STANAG 2047 (CBRN and air
attacks only).




E-8            FM 3-11.3/MCWP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56, C1    30 April 2009
         (3) At fixed installations and at other locations where established
communications and alarms are available, the procedures in STANAG 2047 should
be used.
          (4) Units and installations that are warned should not promulgate the
alarm beyond their own area.
NOTE: As soon as a CBRN cell realizes that the completion and submission
of an NBC3 CHEM report would not warn a unit in the hazard area in time,
it will attempt to pass the alarm by the most expeditious means available.
            (5) CBRN cells will use information in the NBC3 CHEM report to
provide timely warning to units and installations in the predicted downwind hazard
area. Due to climatic and geographical variations, the lateral limits of the predicted
hazard area are normally defined by an angle of lateral spread that is 30° on either
side of the forecast representative downwind direction.
           (6) The hazard area prediction will be less reliable as the distance from
the point of emission increases.
           (7) Units in the downwind hazard area that are warned by a CBRN cell
will not raise an alarm outside their own area, but will submit an NBC4 CHEM
report according to the SOP when the chemical agent cloud actually arrives.
          (8) The limiting dosages of agents assumed in establishing the
procedures for hazard area prediction, while not sufficient to produce casualties
immediately, may produce later effects (i.e., miosis from nerve agents).
      h.   Simplified Hazard Prediction (Land). The simplified hazard prediction
tells subordinate units whether they are in a chemical downwind hazard area. Since
Type A attacks present the greatest hazard, the simplified procedures are based on
that type of attack. It is valid until an NBC3 CHEM report is received. Units need to
make a simplified prediction using a CDM and a simplified template. The template
can be made from acetate, overlay paper, or plastic. Figure E-4, page E-10, shows a
sample simplified predictor. The following steps describe how to use a simplified
prediction:
           (1) Step 1. Get the wind speed from the CDM. If it is less than 10 kph,
use the circular portion of the prediction. If it is greater than 10 kph, follow the
remaining steps.
         (2) Step 2. Get the wind direction from the CDM. Mark that direction on
the compass circle of the template.
           (3) Step 3. Obtain the air stability code from the CDM and adjust the
code using Table D-14, page D-34, to determine the downwind distance (see
Table E-3, page E-11).
           (4) Step 4. Place the template on the map with the attack center of the
prediction (the cross mark) over the actual attack center. Rotate the predictor until
the downwind direction points toward GN.
           (5) Step 5. Draw the downwind line perpendicular to the downwind
direction using the distance obtained in Step 3.

         i.     Detailed Type A Attack Downwind Hazard Prediction (Land).
              (1) Type A agents are normally dispersed as an aerosol or vapor cloud
  with little or no ground contamination. A nonpersistent nerve agent employed
  upwind of the target is an example of this type of attack. Air-contaminating agents
  are normally dispersed in ground-bursting munitions, such as artillery shells and
  multiple rocket launchers.
            (2) For the following two cases of chemical attacks, see examples in
  Figures E-5 and E-6, pages E-12 and E-14) the following information is required:
                         (a)   NBC1 or NBC2 CHEM report.
                         (b)   Detailed MET information.
  NOTE: If detailed MET information is not available, the air stability
  category should be determined by using Table D-13, page D-33. The
  downwind direction and downwind speed must be measured locally.

                (h) Draw a line from the maximum downwind distance at right
angles to the downwind direction line. Extend the line on either side of the
downwind direction line.
               (i) Extend the downwind line upwind from the center of the attack

                (j) Draw two lines from the upwind end of this line, which are
tangents to the attack area circle, and extend them until they intersect with the
maximum downwind distance line. These lines will form a 30° angle on either side of
the downwind line.
                (k)    Ensure that the hazard area is taken to be the area bounded
by—
                •      The upwind edge of the attack area circle.
                •      The two 30° tangents.

                                             Leading-Edge Speed

                (b)    Trailing Edge Speed = Downwind Speed x 0.5

                                          Distance to Point
                Latest Arrival Time =
                                          Trailing-Edge Speed

NOTE: The distance to the points considered must be measured from the
upwind edge (circle center for Case 1) of the attack area.
      j.   Detailed Type B Attack Downwind Hazard Prediction (Land).
           (1) Type B agents are normally dispersed in liquid form to contaminate
surfaces. Persistent nerve and mustard agents are examples of this type of attack.
Ground-contaminating agents are normally dispersed by aircraft spray tanks, air-
bursting artillery shells, rockets, missiles, and mines. The evidence of ground
contamination may include the observer’s report of the agent falling to the ground
from air-bursting munitions, the identification of the agent with NBC-M8 paper, the
positive response of M9 paper, or the identification of a blister agent with the M256
series sampler or reading on the ICAM.

           (2)    For the next six cases of chemical attacks the following information
is required:
                  (a)   NBC1 or NBC2 CHEM report.
                  (b)   Detailed MET information (e.g., CDM or similar information).

            > 20° C                       up to 2 days              up to 1 day


NOTES:
1. The daily mean surface temperature is needed for the estimation of the
probable time after which personnel may safely remove their protective
masks (see Table E-4).
2. The air stability category is not considered in Type B hazard predictions
because the maximum downwind distance is always 10 km.
3. The estimates assume ground contamination densities up to 10 g/m2.
4. When making hazard estimates, the vapor has been considered to be the
determining factor within the attack area and in the downwind hazard
area. The duration of the hazard from contact with bare skin is, however,
difficult to predict. The duration can only be determined by the use of
chemical-agent detection or identification devices.
5. When temperatures are considerably lower than 0°C, the duration of
contamination may be longer than indicated in Table E-4, page E-16. The
absence of vapor does not preclude the presence of contamination.
6. Daily mean surface air temperature may be obtained from local MET
sources.
7. The information in Table E-4 is a worst-case scenario. Real, known
information should be used to the extent possible.

area 2 km. This is equal to twice the radius of the attack area.
                •    Draw two lines from the upwind end of this line, which are
tangents to the attack area circle, and extend them until they intersect with the
10-km downwind distance line. These lines will form a 30° angle on either side of the
downwind line.
               •     Draw a line connecting the downwind corners of the two vapor
hazard areas (Points A and B in Figure E-12, page E-24).

      l.   Adjusted Hazard Prediction (Land). The methods previously discussed are
based on constant environmental conditions. After significant weather changes, the
NBC3 CHEM report may no longer be accurate or apply. An adjusted NBC3 CHEM
report must be sent to the unit or installation in the new hazard area if possible.
Also, notify units who may no longer be in the hazard area. Significant weather
changes include the following:
     •     Representative downwind speed of 10 kph or more or a wind speed that
increases from less than 10 kph to more than 10 kph or the reverse.
       •   Air stability category (Type A attacks only).
       •   Changes in downwind direction by 30° or more.

NOTE: For a change in wind speed, determine the geographical center of the
frontline of the traveling cloud at the time the new data becomes available.
Calculate this distance by multiplying the original wind speed by twice the
time in hours since the attack. The center of the cloud front is then considered
to be the new center of attack area. Once the new center of attack is
determined, the downwind hazard area is determined using the procedures for
that type of attack.
          (1) Recalculation of Hazard Distances. When significant weather
changes occur or are predicted to occur, the following procedures for Type A attacks
should be used to determine—
                (a) The distance the chemical agent cloud will have traveled prior
to the change by using—
             d1      =      u1 x t1
             d1      =      distance traveled prior to change in weather conditions
             u1      =      downwind speed prior to change in weather conditions
          t1  =    time elapsed between the time of attack and the end of the
current CDR time period
NOTE: If the distance traveled, as calculated above, is equal to or exceeds
the original maximum DHD, recalculation is not required.
                (b) For Type A case 2 attacks, measure the distance d1 along the
downwind line and mark it. If that point is outside the current CDR area, get the
CDR for the area containing the new point and get the weather conditions for the
next time period. Compare these weather conditions with those used for the current
CDR time period, and determine if significant weather changes are predicted.
               (c)          Determine the distance the chemical cloud will travel after the
change by using—
             d2      =      H2 - d1
             d2      =      remaining hazard distance
           H2 =             maximum hazard distance under the conditions prevailing
after the change
             d1      =      distance traveled prior to change in weather conditions

NOTES:
1. If the second time period has a wind speed ≤10 kph (Type A1), always
draw a circle with a radius of 10 km (as if d2 = 10 km).
2. In constructing the hazard area, keep in mind that the maximum hazard
distance, valid during either set of weather conditions, must not be
exceeded. If d2 is ≤0, recalculation is not required.

move it to the perimeter of the circle on the new downwind direction line. This will
take into account the fact that some of the chemical cloud may travel at 1.5 times
the mean wind speed and will, therefore, have traveled further.

                (a) Plot the hazard area as calculated before and after the change
in wind direction, using the procedure described above.
                (b) Indicate on the GENTEXT/CBRNINFO line the reason for
recalculation and the effective time for the new hazard area.
          (8) Type B, Case 2, 4, and 6 Attacks With a Change in Wind Speed from
>10 kph to ≤10 kph.
               (a) Plot the hazard area as calculated for the wind speed >10 kph,
using the appropriate procedure described above for the correct case.
               (b) Plot the hazard area as calculated for the wind speed ≤10 kph,
using the appropriate procedure described above for the correct case.
          (9) Hazard Area. The examples of the hazard area are valid after a
change in wind direction; they also include the area before the change. This takes
into account transient hazards caused by the shift in wind direction in the areas
between the two hazards.
           (10) After Recalculation. When recalculation is complete, calculate the
arrival time of the hazard and issue an NBC3 CHEM report/map overlays to the
units or installations that will be affected. Issue the new NBC3 CHEM report to
those units initially warned to inform them that there may be a residual vapor
hazard in their area. The same strike serial number should be used as in the

previous message, and the previous message should be referred to in the
GENTEXT/CBRNINFO line of the new message.


     m. MERWARN. A simplified contamination warning system has been
established throughout NATO for broadcasting warnings of contamination
dangerous to merchant shipping via the Merchant Ship Communications System
(MERCOMMS) and coastal radio stations. This system calls for the origination, by
NATO naval authorities, of three types of messages relating to chemical avoidance.
          (1) 	 MERWARN NBC3.
                (a) This message is issued to pass immediate warning of a
predicted chemical contamination and hazard area. MERWARN NBC3 CHEM
reports are issued as soon as possible after each attack. They contain sufficient
information to enable the master of a ship to plot the downwind hazard area. The
following standard format will be used for MERWARN NBC3:
          MERWARN NBC3 CHEM                 (Message identifier)
           ALFA:              Strike serial number (as defined by naval authority).
           DELTA:             DTG (Z) of start and end of attack.
           FOXTROT:           Location of event.
           GOLF:              Delivery means.
           INDIA:             Release information.
           PAPAA:             Predicted attack and hazard area.
NOTE: If the downwind speed is ≤5 knots or variable, line PAPAA will
consist of three digits instead of coordinates, representing the radius of a
circle in nautical miles, centered on the location of the attack contained in
line FOXTROT.
           YANKEE:            Downwind direction and speed. 

           ZULU:              Information on actual weather conditions. 

           GENTEXT:           Remarks. 

NOTE: Some of the letter items above may not be completed in the report
that is received, but there will be sufficient information for a downwind
hazard plot to be developed.
                (b) The MERWARN NBC3 standard format may not be suitable
after a multiple chemical attack, which produces a hazard from several attacks or
depositions in a large or complex target area. In such cases, warnings will be plain
language statements of a more general nature, indicating areas affected and
expected movement of the hazard.

                         HAZARD IS EXPECTED TO HAVE DISPERSED BY
                         021000ZSEP1999//
          (2) MERWARN Diversion Order. This is a general diversion order,
based on the threat, whereby merchant ships proceeding independently are passed
evasive routing instructions of a general nature. In addition to the origination of a
MERWARN NBC3 message, naval authorities may, if circumstances dictate,
broadcast general diversion orders, based on the hazard areas, whereby merchant
ships proceeding independently will be passed evasive routing instructions of a more
general nature, using the standard naval control of shipping identifier MERWARN
DIVERSION ORDER.
           Example: MERWARN DIVERSION ORDER: English Channel closed. All
shipping in the North Sea is to remain north of 052 degrees N until
031500ZSEP1999.
   n. MERWARN Plotting. When a chemical attack is reported in a
MERWARN NBC3 message, the following procedures should be followed:
       •   Plot the location of the attack from the details in line FOXTROT.
       •   Plot the coordinates or radius of the circle contained in line PAPAA.
If a MERWARN NBC3 is not received but observations of an attack or a local report
of an attack is received, then the following procedures should be carried out:
           (1)   Mark the actual or suspected location of the attack on the chart.
           (2) Draw a circle, radius 0.5 nautical miles (NM), centered on the attack
location. From the center of the attack area, draw the downwind direction, which is
contained in line CHARLIE of the MERWARN NBC CDM.
           (3) Place the center of the ship chemical template (Figure E-21, page E­
41) on the center of the attack area. Position the center line of the template on the
downwind direction line.



E-40                 FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56 2 February 2006
                       Figure E-21. Air Stability Category (Sea)
            (4) Keep the center line of the template on the downwind direction, and
move the template upwind until the 20° lines of the template make tangents with
the circle around the attack area.
         (5) Mark the tangent lines using the holes in the template. Join these
marks with the attack area circle.
           (6) If the chemical agent is identified as nerve agent, determine the
DHD for the miosis level (Table E-6) for the agent. Measure this distance from the
center of the attack area on the downwind direction line, and mark it. Through this
point, draw a line perpendicular to the downwind direction line until it meets the
two tangents.
          (7) If the agent is unknown, use the DHD of 44 NM, as this will be the
worst-case scenario.
          (8)     The hazard area is now defined as the area bounded by the—
          •       Upwind radius of the attack area.
          •       20° tangents.
          •       DHD line.
          (9)     Adjustments to the DHD can be made when the agent is identified.
     o.    Simplified Procedure Requirements (Sea). The simplified procedure
requires the following:
     •    Sea chart of the AO.
     •    Ship chemical template.

           •    NBC1 or NBC2 CHEM report.
           •    NBC CDM.
  If a valid NBC CDM is not available, Figure E-21 may be used to determine the air
  stability category, which is the basis for the determination of the maximum DHD.
  This distance is determined from Table E-6. When using the simplified procedure,
  use the DHDs related to miosis. The representative downwind direction and
  downwind speed must be determined onboard.

                (1)      Determination of the Hazard Area. The hazard area is determined
  as follows:
                  (a) Plot the center of the attack area (line FOXTROT) on the chart.
  Draw a circle (0.5NM radius) around the center to represent the attack area.
                  (b) Place the template for a simplified chemical hazard area
  prediction on the chart in such a way that the center point of the template circle
  coincides with the center of the attack area. The value on the protractor
  corresponding to the downwind direction given in the NBC CDM must be oriented
  towards north on the chart. Mark this position of the template on the chart by using
  the holes punched in the template along the downwind axis.
                   (c) Move the template back along the downwind axis until the
  radial lines become tangents to the circle (30° standard). Use the holes punched out
  along the radial lines to mark the position and connect to the circle, forming
  tangents.
                   (d) Mark the maximum DHD on the downwind axis. Through this
  point, draw a line perpendicular to the downwind axis to intersect the tangents
  (Figure E-22, page E-44).
  NOTE: When light winds are reported (wind speeds of 5 knots or less) in
  the NBC CDM, the hazard area is represented by a circle concentric to the
  attack area, with a radius equal to 15 NM.

                •       20 degrees for a wind speed of 10 knots or more.
      (3) Low Wind Speeds. For wind speeds of 5 knots or less, the hazard area
will be circular, with a radius equal to the DHD for 5-knot wind speed. However,
the radius should not exceed 15 NM.
       q.   Determination of the Downwind Hazard Area.
          (1) Plotting the Downwind Hazard Area. To plot the chemical
downwind hazard area on a sea chart or on general operations plot, the above
information is used in the following way (see Figures E-24 and E-25, pages E-47 and
E-48).
                  (a) Plot the location of the attack area. If the exact location (center
of the attack) is known, draw a circle with a radius of 0.5 NM around this point. If
only a dissemination area is reported, determine the center point of this area and
draw a circle with a radius of 0.5 NM around this point. If the size of the attack
area is known to be larger, adjust the radius accordingly.
                 (b) Plot the downwind direction. From the center of the attack
area circle, draw a line representing the downwind direction.
                 (c) Draw the tangents to the attack area. Draw two lines which,
being tangents to the circle, form an angle equal to the half-sector angle on either
side of the representative downwind direction (downwind axis).
                 (d) Plot the hazard levels. Label the point on the downwind
direction line (downwind axis), marking the extent of the DHD for the relevant level
of hazard (LCt50, ICt5, and/or miosis). Draw a line through this (these) point(s),
perpendicular to the downwind axis and intersecting the two tangents. The
downwind hazard area is contained within this line, the tangents, and the upwind
arc of the attack area circle.
           (2) Low Wind Speeds. When low wind speeds (5 knots or less) are
reported in the NBC CDM, draw a circle concentric to the attack area circle, using
the relevant DHD as the radius. However, the radius should not exceed 15 NM (see
Figure E-26, page E-49).

          (1) Adjustment Requirements. If the MET conditions change during the
hazard, the predicted hazard area must be adjusted for the following:
                 (a)   Stability category changes from one category to another.
                 (b) Wind speed changes of more than 5 knots or from 5 knots or
less, to more than 5 knots, and vice versa.

               (c)   Wind direction changes of more than 20°.
           (2) Recalculation of Hazard. The new hazard area is determined by
calculating the downwind distance that the agent cloud may have traveled at the
time of the change in the MET conditions using the representative downwind speed.
Consider this point to be the center point of a new attack area, and draw a circle
around it with a radius equal to half the width of the hazard area at that point.
From there on, repeat the steps using the procedure described previously. The
distance which the agent cloud may already have traveled must be subtracted from
the maximum DHD under the new weather conditions (see Figure E-27, page E-52).
           (3) Agent Clouds Crossing the Coast Line. When a cloud from a
chemical agent crosses the coast line from sea to land or vice versa, consider the
point where the downwind direction line (downwind axis) intersects the coast line to
be the center point of a new attack area. Follow the procedure described above using
the appropriate tables for sea and land to determine the DHDs. When frequent
changes occur, use the land procedure when working manually.
           (4) Beginning and End of Hazard. In the case of air-contaminating
attacks (nonpersistent agent), the beginning and end of the hazard at a given point
may be determined using the following:
               (a)   Representative downwind speed.
               (b)   Distance of the location from the edge of the attack area.
               (c)   Beginning and end of the attack.
The following two formulas are used:
               tB = (dA x 60) / (1.5 x VZ) or tB = (dA x 40) / VZ
               and
               tE = (dB x 60) / (0.5 x VZ) or tE = (dB x 120) / VZ = 3 x tB
          Where—
               tB = time in minutes from the beginning of the attack to the
               beginning of the hazard.
               dA = distance between the location and the downwind leading edge of
               the dissemination area (in NM).
               dB = distance between the location and the downwind trailing edge
               of the dissemination area (in NM).
               VZ = wind speed in knots. If necessary, the wind speed must be
               determined as the mean wind speed over several periods of validity
               of the NBC CDM.

               tE = time in minutes from the end of the attack to the end of the 

               hazard.

     Example: 

                  Given: dA = 5 NM, VZ = 10 knots. 

                  Using the formulas, tB and tE are calculated as follows: 

                       tB = (5 NM x 40) / 10 knots = 20 minutes, and
                       tE = (5 NM x 120) / 10 knots = 60 minutes
            (5) Hazard Arrival Time. The beginning of the hazard is expected at
this location 20 minutes after the beginning of the attack and is expected to end 60
minutes after the end of the attack.
           (6) Maximum Duration. The expected maximum duration of the
air-contaminating hazard (i.e., when the calculated hazard is expected to be
completely clear) may be obtained by using the maximum DHD as dA, and
calculating tE from the formulas in paragraph (4) above.
          (7) The CBRN cells must continuously check the NBC3 CHEM
messages issued in order to ensure that any new information (MET or CBRN) is
considered. If necessary, a corrected NBC3 CHEM message must be transmitted.

6.     NBC4 CHEM Report
      a.    When any unit detects CBRN hazards through monitoring, survey, or
reconnaissance, this information is reported using an NBC4 CHEM report (see
Figure E-28). Separate NBC4 CHEM reports are consolidated and then plotted on
the tactical map to show where the hazard exists. If monitoring information is
incomplete, a survey may be directed. Monitoring reports contain the type of agent
detected (line INDIA) indicating the type of chemical agent and persistency, the
location of the sampling (geographical position), the type of sample (air sample or
liquid sample) (line QUEBEC), the date-time of the detection (line SIERRA), and
topography information (line TANGO).

      c.   If no chemical agent is detected, this should be reported by entering NIL
in line INDIA. When all hazards from one attack are gone, the responsible CBRN
cell should annotate this in an NBC4 CHEM report by entering NIL in line INDIA
and by entering "CHEMICAL FREE ATTACK" in line GENTEXT/NBC INFO. To be
able to identify the attack, the strike serial number (line ALFA from the NBC2
CHEM report) must be included in the report.

7.      NBC5 CHEM Report
      a.    The NBC5 CHEM report is prepared from the contamination plot. This
report is last in order because it consists of a series of grid coordinates. Often, this
message must be sent via radio nets. This requires lengthy transmission. The
recipient is required to plot each coordinate and redraw the plot. This report may
also be sent as a map overlay.
      b.   For NBC5 CHEM reports, line items INDIA (release information),
OSCAR (reference time), and XRAYA (actual contour information) are mandatory
(see Figure E-29).

                                        Appendix F
          BIOLOGICAL-CONTAMINATION AVOIDANCE TACTICS, 

                  TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES


1.   Background
      As with all forms of CBRN attacks or ROTA, an effective means of communication
must be trained and rehearsed for the avoidance of biological contamination to be
successful. Once a unit is aware that it may have been in a biological attack or is within a
possible hazard area, the avoidance procedures throughout this manual should be initiated.
The CBRNWRS should be used to relay information about the biological agents and
hazards in an efficient and timely manner. Biological avoidance requires an understanding
of what biological agents are, how they may be employed, and what happens to the agents
after they are released. Biological agents are broken down into two broad categories—
pathogens and toxins.
    •     Pathogens are infectious agents that cause disease in man, animals, or plants.
Agents that constitute antipersonnel BW threats include bacteria, viruses, and rickettsias.
     •    Toxins are poisonous substances produced as by-products of the microorganisms
(pathogens), plants, and animals.
2.   Biological-Agent Dissemination Methods
     There are three general methods of disseminating biological agents—aerosol, vector,
and covert. Each method is designed to get the agent into the body, and each method
targets a specific portal of entry in order to infect the individual.
     a.    Aerosol Dissemination.
           (1) Biological Agents. Biological agents may be disseminated by ground- or air-
bursting munitions, aircraft spray tanks, or boat- or truck-mounted aerosol generators. An
aerosol attack will most likely occur in a covert (hidden) manner. Dissemination is likely to
occur at altitudes of 1,000 feet or less (100 feet optimum). The estimation of the hazard
areas resulting from dissemination at altitudes greater than 1,000 feet aboveground
requires extensive MET analysis.
         (2) Toxins. Toxins can be disseminated as a liquid (such as “yellow rain”). This
makes the toxin highly visible and an immediate hazard. It will generally be limited to the
immediate area of the attack.
            (3) Aerosol Cloud Travel. In a tactical aerosol attack, the aerosol cloud (after
initial formation) will travel downwind at a rate determined by the wind speed. The cloud
will lengthen and widen as it travels downwind. The length of the agent cloud will equal
about one-third of the distance traveled. Units near the release point will encounter a more
concentrated cloud. However, units located farther downwind (even though exposed to a
less concentrated agent cloud) will be exposed for a longer period of time, so unprotected
personnel may inhale a higher total dose. The peak danger area will be located in the area
where the cloud stays intact, while at the same time, it is at its maximum width and
length. This distance is approximately the maximum downwind hazard prediction for a



30 April 2009   FM 3-11.3/MCWP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56, C1                F-1
chemical agent; therefore, it is vital to determine whether or not the attack is biological or
chemical.
           (4) Casualty Production. The biological-agent cloud can cause immediate and
delayed casualties. This is due to the fact that each individual will receive a different dose,
and the time until the onset of symptoms will depend on the amount of agent received and
each individual’s physiological makeup. The onset of illness will also be affected by the
person’s reaction time and any other forms of protection (i.e., inoculation, masking time)
that were available against the agent. Biological-agent casualties can occur in an area as
much as two times the maximum DHD for a chemical agent.
            (5) Dispersal and Settling Out. Traveling farther downwind, the cloud is
exposed to the environmental elements. It is subjected to dispersal, settling, and impaction
on the terrain features. The agent cloud will lose much of its concentration, and the losses
will be such that the majority of unprotected personnel will not receive an infective
(pathogen) or effective (toxin) dose. Dispersal will not be uniform, and casualties may occur
as far as four to five times the maximum DHD of chemical agents.
                  (a) Bursting-Type Munitions. When a biological projectile or bomb bursts,
the filling (liquid slurry or dry powder) is initially dispersed in all directions. An effective
ground-bursting munition will project the majority of the filling into the air to form an
aerosol cloud. Air-bursting munitions may also form an aerosol cloud that will behave in a
similar manner to a spray attack. The agent may be designed to fall to the ground as a
surface contaminant, much like persistent chemical agents. The dimensions of the aerosol
cloud will be influenced by the means of delivery, weather conditions, and terrain.
                (b) Spray Tanks and Generators. Aircraft and vehicle spray tanks or
aerosol generators may be employed to form an aerosol cloud. This form of attack is likely to
take place covertly.
      b.   Vector Dissemination. Some pathogens may be delivered by the use of vectors,
such as fleas, ticks, lice, or mosquitoes. Many of these same vectors have carried diseases
since recorded history, and avoidance procedures should be practiced at all times to limit
the potential for infection.
          (1) Controlling Vectors. One of the major difficulties with vectors is control.
Once they are released, they are basically out of control and can attack anyone. Vectors are
quite mobile and can easily leave the area where they were released.
            (2) Logistical and Production Problems. Getting a live, infective pathogen
inside a vector is a difficult proposition. Getting the vector inside a delivery vehicle that will
not damage or kill the vector is another difficult issue. Doing these things and then
delivering sufficient quantities of the vectors to be effective in producing a disease outbreak
will be difficult.
     c.    Covert Dissemination. Sabotage and terrorist personnel may possess a variety of
aerosol and contamination (poisoning) techniques for various targets. Aerosol techniques
can be fairly large operations, using aerosol generators (or foggers) that produce large,
open-air hazard areas. These techniques also can be more limited and selective, targeting
the enclosed air space of key C2 facilities, aircraft, ships, troop billets, and similar areas.
Biological agents in liquid, powders, or spray can be placed directly into foodstuffs at
harvest, processing, distribution, and preparation points. They can also be placed into the
water reservoir or distribution chain.

3.   Avoidance Procedures
     Avoidance procedures are broken down into actions—before, during, and after the
attack. For a biological attack, these procedures will also be broken down by the different
dissemination methods. The lists given, while not all-encompassing, will assist in
developing the unit SOP and directives.
     a.     Aerosol Avoidance Procedures.
            (1)   Preattack.
                  (a)   Alert subordinate units.
                (b) Establish and enforce preventive medicine (PVNTMED) programs to
include immunizations, area sanitation, personal-hygiene standards, and rest and
nutritional needs of the troops.
                  (c)   Gain intelligence on the threat capabilities and intentions.
                  (d) Seek out, intercept, and destroy enemy weapon systems, production
facilities, and storage sites.
               (e) Instruct troops on the threat, how to recognize the attack, and
protective measures to be taken.
                  (f)   Train and drill on the fitting and donning of protective masks and
clothing.
                  (g)   Set up collective protection systems for personnel, equipment, and
supplies.
NOTE: Field-expedient collective protection must be airtight.
                  (h)   Identify backup (alternate) food, water, and supply sources.
                  (i)   Establish detection and sampling procedures.
                  (j)   Conduct a vulnerability analysis.
                  (k)   Increase MEDSURV.
                  (l)   Increase food and water surveillance.
                 (m) Distribute prophylaxis if the threat agents are known and prophylaxis
for the agent exists.
            (2)   During Attack.
                  (a)   Recognize the attack.
                 (b) Initiate personnel protective measures. In the event of a potential
biological attack involving a munitions release, masking is the first priority; but since the
attack may be chemical or toxin, MOPP4 is initially required. For the maximum protection
and the lowest risk of incurring casualties, soldiers should wear protective clothing and
masks for at least 4 hours after the unit has been attacked or the agent cloud is predicted
or known to have passed through the unit area. Every effort must be made to identify the
exact agent, including its characteristics. If the skin is contaminated, remove the
contamination immediately using the procedures provided in the Multiservice Tactics,

Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear
Decontamination.
                  (c)     Repulse or eliminate the delivery vehicle or weapons.
                (d) Observe for distinguishing signs between a biological- and chemical-
agent attack or a mixture of a conventional and biological attack.
              (e) Report the attack utilizing the CBRNWRS. A biological attack that
cannot be immediately identified will be reported as an NBC1 UNK.
            (3)   Postattack.
               (a) Estimate the downwind hazard. Significant casualties in unprotected
personnel can occur at two times the maximum DHD for a chemical agent.
                  (b)     Determine the BW agent.
                 (c) Initiate prophylaxis and vaccination against a biological attack. This
should be the first priority once the agent is known.
                  (d)     Begin sampling and collection procedures according to the unit SOP.
                (e) Consume only sealed rations and properly contained water. Outer-
container surfaces, if exposed, must be properly decontaminated. Call PVNTMED personnel
when the safety of the unit level water supplies is questionable. Inspect food storage depots
and supply points. Replenish water supplies from the water purification units.
                 (f) Separate the biological casualties. Separate the ill from the well
individuals if the BW agent is contagious (isolation of ill). If possible, only properly
protected individuals (vaccinated, on prophylaxis, or in proper personal protective
equipment) should provide treatment to sick individuals. If unprotected individuals must
provide treatment, use a minimum number of personnel until protective prophylaxis or
equipment can be obtained. Keep in mind that when dealing with contagious individuals,
evacuation options may be limited.
                  (g)     Implement movement restriction if the BW agent is contagious.
      b.    Vector Avoidance Procedures.
            (1)   Preattack.
                  (a)     Apply insect repellant on the exposed skin.
                  (b)     Gain intelligence on the threat capabilities and intentions.
               (c) Seek out, intercept, and destroy enemy weapon systems and
production and storage sites.
                  (d)     Instruct troops on the threat, recognition of the attack, and protective
measures.
                (e) Establish and enforce PVNTMED programs, to include
immunizations, area sanitation, personal-hygiene standards, and rest and nutritional
needs of the troops.

          (2)     During Attack.
              (a) Recognize and report suspicious indications of the vector attack (the
   sudden appearance of large numbers or strange kinds of insects not previously
   encountered in an operational area or the finding of vector bomblet cages).
                (b) Cover the exposed skin. Balance between protection and performance
   degradation. Protective overgarments will not totally exclude a determined tick.
   Bloused trousers and rolled-down, buttoned sleeves with insect repellant (properly
   applied) will probably afford as much protection with less degradation.
                  (c)   Apply insect repellant liberally, especially to neck, face, ankle, and
   wrist areas.
                  (d)   Report the attack.
          (3)     Postattack.
                  (a)   Coordinate with the supporting medical authority for PVNTMED
assistance.
                (b) Begin insecticide and other pest control measures as outlined by
PVNTMED personnel. Logistical support for unit size pest control procedures should be a
coordinated effort between the CBRN staff and the supporting medical authority.
Physically remove lice, ticks, and fleas from body by self-aid and buddy aid, as necessary.
              (c) Make hazard estimates. Reconnaissance and medical reports may
help the CBRN staff assess the hazard areas.
     c.   Covert Avoidance Procedures.
          (1)     Preattack.
                  (a)   Maintain OPSEC.
                  (b)   Identify covert and sabotage threat force capabilities and intentions.
               (c)      Arrange for security measures to be taken based upon threat 

   assessment.

                  (d)   Identify alternate supply sources for high-risk items.
               (e) Instruct troops to be alert to the dissemination devices or signs of
   covert tampering, as intelligence dictates.
                (f) Establish and enforce PVNTMED programs, to include
   immunizations, area sanitation, personal-hygiene standards, and rest and nutrition
   needs of the troops. The protection of food and water may prevent the successful
   employment of a specific biological agent.
          (2)     During Attack.
               (a) Report the observation of an attack, the apprehension of enemy agents
   engaged in such activity, or the finding of signs and indications of covert attacks.
                 (b) Initiate personnel and collective protection. For maximum protection
   and the lowest risk of incurring casualties, soldiers should maintain protective posture
   for at least 4 hours.

             (3)   Postattack.
                  (a) Warn personnel downstream, downwind, and down the supply lines.
      The CBRN cell will warn personnel based on at-hand medical and intelligence
      information and the analysis of NBC1 BIO reports.
                    (b) In conjunction with veterinary personnel and the Surgeon General,
      initiate the disposal and replacement of food, water, and other supplies. The CBRN cell
      can coordinate inspections and medically approved replenishment sources. Actions
      involving the disposal of major quantities of food must be coordinated with the
      supporting veterinary personnel. Actions involving the disposal of major quantities of
      other nonmedical supplies should be coordinated with the CBRN cell.
                  (c) Initiate sampling based on the knowledge, consent, and special
      sampling requirements. If a BW attack is suspected, wash surfaces with at least a 5
      percent solution of bleach. Bleach is a very effective form of decontamination for most
      BW agents.
4.     Biological-Contamination Reporting, Predicting, and Plotting
     In order for a unit to implement passive avoidance measures, it will need advanced
warning of a potential contamination. The rest of this chapter deals with the various NBC
BIO reports and the prediction of hazard areas.
5.     NBC1 BIO Report
      The NBC1 BIO report is the most widely used report. The observing unit uses this
report to provide CBRN attack data. All units must be completely familiar with the NBC1
BIO report format and the information needed to complete the report. This report is
prepared quickly and accurately at the unit level and sent to the next higher HQ or NBC
cell as directed by OPORDs/directives. NBC1 BIO reports are not routinely passed to corps
or higher CBRN cells, except for the initial-use report. Lines BRAVO (location of observer),
DELTA (DTG), GOLF (means of delivery), INDIA (release information), and TANGO
(terrain, topography, and vegetation description) are mandatory entries in the NBC1
report.
       a.   Precedence. The precedence of the NBC1 BIO report depends on whether or not
it is an initial report. The initial use of a CBRN weapons report is FLASH precedence; all
others are IMMEDIATE precedence.
     b.   Preparation. Individuals identified by the unit SOP submit raw data to the unit
CBRN defense team. The NBC1 BIO format should be used; however, a SALUTE, or spot
report may also be used and should be submitted to the unit CBRN defense team. The unit
CBRN defense team normally consists of the individuals who have been trained in CBRN
defense. This ensures that the report is in the proper format and is correct.
    c.    Sample. A sample NBC1 report is shown in Figure F-1. The column “Cond”
shows O (operationally determined) or M (mandatory) for each message type.
Operationally determined sets listed may be added or deleted at the user’s discretion.

6.   NBC2 BIO Report
     The NBC2 BIO report is based on one or more NBC1 BIO reports. It is used to pass
evaluated data to higher, subordinate, and adjacent units. The CBRN cell is usually the
lowest level that prepares NBC2 BIO reports. However, CBRN personnel at an
intermediate HQ may prepare NBC2 BIO reports if they have sufficient data. These
intermediate HQ, however, will not assign a strike serial number. The CBRN cell prepares
the NBC2 BIO report, assigns it a strike serial number, and disseminates it to the
appropriate units. Each subordinate unit then decides whether to disseminate the report
further. Lines ALFA (strike serial number), DELTA (DTG), FOXTROT (location of attack),
GOLF (means of delivery), INDIA (release information), and TANGO (terrain, topography,
and vegetation description) are mandatory entries in the NBC2 BIO report. A sample
NBC2 BIO report is shown in Figure F-2, page F-8.

7.      NBC3 BIO Report
      Area CBRN centers use NBC2 BIO reports and current wind information to predict
the area of hazard. This prediction is disseminated as an NBC3 BIO report. It is sent to all
units or activities that could be affected by the hazard. Each unit or activity prepares a plot
of the NBC3 BIO report, determines which of its subordinate units or activities are affected,
and warns them accordingly. Commanders should use this report as battlefield intelligence
when planning missions. The NBC3 BIO report is a prediction of the hazard area. This
prediction is safe-sided to ensure that a significant hazard will not exist outside the
predicted hazard area. As the JWARN is developed and fielded, its built-in models will give
a more realistic depiction of the predicted hazard area. Units within the hazard area must
adjust their MOPP level if necessary. A sample NBC3 BIO report is shown in Figure F-3.

     a.    Definitions. In order to avoid contamination, the commander needs to know
where the contamination is located. The biological prediction procedure provides
information on the location, extent of the hazard area, and duration of the hazard resulting
from attacks with biological weapons. It provides the necessary information for
commanders to warn units within the predicted hazard area. The following definitions are
used in predicting biological hazards.
           (1) Attack Area. This is the predicted area immediately affected by the
delivered biological agent.
          (2) Hazard Area. This is the predicted area in which unprotected personnel
may be affected by an agent spreading downwind from the attack area. The downwind
distance depends on the type of attack and on the weather and terrain in the attack and
downwind areas.
            (3) Contaminated Area. This is the area in which a biological hazard may
remain at hazardous levels for some time after the attack. The contamination may be in
solid or liquid form. The actual shape and duration can only be determined by surveys and
sampling.

      b.   Types of Biological Attacks. Biological attacks can be categorized into the
following four groups, based on the means of delivery and wind speed (see Table F-1,
page F-11).
           (1) Type P. Type P consists of attacks with localized exploding munitions (such as
bomb [BOM], shell [SHL], rocket [RKT], mine [MNE], surface burst missile [MSL]), surface
release spray (SPR), or surface release aerosol generator (GEN).
           (2) Type Q. Type Q consists of attacks with munitions that cover a large area
(such as bomblets [BML] or air burst MSL).
           (3) Type R. Type R consists of attacks where the location of the attack is known,
but the type of container is unknown (UNK), or the attack was from an air release SPR or
GEN.
          (4) Type S. Type S consists of detection after an unobserved attack.
NOTE: A surface release SPR or GEN should be treated as Type R if it is mobile
and releases material over a distance exceeding 1 km.

     c.   Hazard Prediction. Before a detailed prediction can be made, the CBRN staff will
determine the type of biological attack and the case. This information is crucial for the
hazard prediction.
        (1) Attack Location. Determine or estimate the location of the attack from the
NBC1 BIO reports, and mark it on a map overlay.
           (2) Attack Areas. Determine or estimate the type of attack from the NBC1 BIO
reports. The attack area is plotted as outlined below.
                (a) Type P. The attack area for Type P is drawn as a 2 km radius circle,
centered at the release location.
                (b) Type Q. The attack area for Type Q is drawn as a 10 km radius circle,
centered at the release location.
                  (c) Type R. The attack area for Type R is defined by the line end points
entered as two positions in set FOXTROT. A 2 km radius circle is drawn at the center
position or at the two end positions, with tangents connecting the two circles together. If
the flight direction cannot be established, assume it to be perpendicular to the wind
direction. If only one position is reported in set FOXTROT, the line is 100 km, long-centered
on this point, oriented in the direction of the aircraft trajectory, and centered at the middle
of the observed flight path.
                (d) Type S. The attack area for Type S is drawn as a 50 km radius circle,
centered at the detection location. The attack area is unknown; this is only an initial area.
NOTE: The attack area for Types P, Q, or R may be reduced or enlarged based on
the available information specified in GENTEXT. In computer-generated
messages, this information will be formatted as RDS: XXX km, always using three
digits for the radius (e.g., RDS: 045 km).
       d.   Downwind Travel Distances.
          (1) Downwind Travel. The downwind travel distance is defined as the distance
traveled by the center of the cloud. The downwind travel distance is broken into three
segments corresponding to the three time periods of the NBC CDR as follows:
                 d1 = u1t1
                 d2 = 2u2
                 d3 = u3 * (4 – t1)
Where—
            d1 = distance (in km) travelled within the first NBC CDR 2-hour period of the
attack.
            d2 = distance (in km) travelled within the next NBC CDR 2-hour period.
            d3 = distance (in km) travelled within the third NBC CDR 2-hour period.
            u1 = wind speed (in kph) for the first NBC CDR 2-hour period following the
attack.
            u2 = wind speed (in kph) for the next NBC CDR 2-hour period.
            u3 = wind speed (in kph) for the third NBC CDR 2-hour period.


F-12            FM 3-11.3/MCWP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56, C1       30 April 2009
           t1 = hours remaining after the attack or detection within the NBC CDR 2-hour
period of validity corresponding to the attack.
           (2)   Special Cases.
           •   For any NBC CDR time periods where the wind speed is <10 kph, a value of
10 kph should be used for computations.
           •     Weather information may not be available for the full 6-hour period after
an attack. If this is the case, the hazard distances can only be calculated for the time
weather is available.
          (3) Downwind Travel Distance. To calculate the downwind travel distance,
perform the following steps:
           •    Step 1. If the attack or detection occurs in the first NBC CDR 2-hour time
period, three downwind distances are calculated: d1, using the first NBC CDR time period
(set WHISKEYM); d2, using the second NBC CDR time period (set XRAYM); and d3, using
the third NBC CDR time period (set YANKEEM).
          •    Step 2. If the attack or detection occurs in the second NBC CDR time
period, downwind distances are calculated: d1, using the second NBC CDR time period (set
XRAYM) and d2, using the third NBC CDR time period (set YANKEEM).
           •    Step 3. If the attack or detection occurs in the third NBC CDR time period,
only d1 can be calculated using set YANKEEM.
            (4) Total Downwind Distance. The total downwind distance of the center of the
biological cloud is the sum of the three distances:
                 DA = d1 + d2 + d3
           Where — 

                 DA = total downwind distance in km.

            (5) Leading and Trailing Edges. The leading and trailing edges for the current
NBC CDR should also be computed, based on the downwind distance path and using the
factors of 1.5 and 0.5, respectively:
                 DL = 1.5DA

       e.   Determining Initial Hazard Areas.
            (1)   Case 1 Attacks.
               (a) Wind Speed. The wind speed is 10 kph or less, so a wind speed of 10
kph should be used.
                (b) Radius of Hazard Area. The radius of the hazard area circle equals the
attack area radius plus the product of a wind speed of 10 kph times the time in hours
remaining after the attack or detection in the corresponding CDR time period. For example,
in a Type P, Case 1 attack having a 2-hour travel duration, the hazard area radius would
equal:
                  (time × wind speed) = radius for Case 1
                  (2 h × 10 km/h) + 2 km = 22 km
                (c) Types P, Q, and S. A single hazard area circle will result for Types P,
Q, and S. The area within this circle represents the hazard area. The attack area for Type S
is drawn as 50 km.
               (d) Type R. Two circles are drawn for Type R, with tangents drawn
between the hazard area circles. The total enclosed area represents the hazard area.
                 (e) Downwind Distance. A value of zero is used for the downwind distance
path, leading edge, and trailing edge computations for Case 1 attacks, since the wind
direction is considered variable. The leading edge can be considered to be the edge of the
hazard area circle.
            (2)   Case 2 Attacks.
            (a) Downwind Direction. Determine the downwind direction from the
NBC CDM. Draw a line through the center of the attack circle, oriented in the downwind
direction.
                (b) Type R. For a Type R release, choose one of the attack area circles.
Calculate the downwind distance for the first period (d1). The line should extend to distance
d1 in the downwind direction from the center of the circle. In the upwind direction along the
same line, mark a distance equal to twice the attack circle radius.
              (c) End of d1. Draw a line perpendicular to the downwind direction line,
at the downwind distance (d1), and extending in both directions.
                 (d) Tangent Lines. Draw two lines tangent to the attack circle from the
upwind point marked, extending until they intersect with the perpendicular line. These
lines will form a 30° angle on either side of the downwind direction line.
                 (e) Type R. For a Type R release, repeat this procedure for the other
attack area circle and connect the lower hazard area corners to enclose the combined
downwind hazard area.
                (f) Type S. For a Type S release, there is no hazard area plotted because
the location and time of the release is unknown. A 50-km radius circle defines an area

where there is a risk of being exposed to the biological agent. Informing friendly units
throughout the area of this risk should be considered. Before a hazard prediction can be
carried out, reports are required from units in the area or survey teams. Once more
information about the attack has been obtained, Type S attacks should then be treated as
Type P, Q, or R.

NOTE: A = radius of attack area, d1 = downwind travel distance in the CDR time
period, t1 = time remaining from attack in the CDR time period, u1 = wind speed, d1 =
u1 x t1.
                (a) Step 1. Obtain the locations of the attack end points from the relevant
NBC BIO message(s) (set FOXTROT), and plot them on the map. Connect the end points to
form the attack line.
                (b) Step 2. Draw a circle with the attack area radius around each point.
                  (c) Step 3. Connect these circles on both sides by drawing tangents to the
circles parallel to the attack line to designate the attack area.
                (d)   Step 4. Draw a GN line from the center of each circle.
              (e) Step 5. Using the valid NBC CDM, identify the downwind direction
and the downwind speed.
               (f) Step 6. From the center of each attack area circle, draw a line
showing the downwind direction.
                (g)   Step 7. Determine the downwind travel distance (d1).
                 (h) Step 8. Plot the downwind travel distance from the center of each
attack area circle on the downwind direction lines.
                 (i) Step 9. From the downwind travel distance, draw a line perpendicular
to each of the downwind direction lines. Extend the lines to either side of the downwind
direction lines.
                 (j) Step 10. Extend the downwind direction lines, twice the attack area
radius, upwind from the center of each attack area circle. This is equal to twice the radius
of the attack area.
                (k) Step 11. From the upwind end of each line, draw two lines, which are
tangents to the attack area circle, and extend them until they intersect with the
perpendiculars to the downwind direction lines. These lines will form a 30° angle on either
side of the downwind direction lines.
               (l) Step 12. Draw a line connecting the downwind corners of the two
hazard areas (Points X and Y in Figure F-9, page F-21).
                 (m) Step 13. Prepare and transmit an NBC3 BIO report to units and
installations in the predicted hazard area according to the SOP.

NOTE: H1 = radius of hazard area.
                (a) Step 1. Obtain the location of the attack from the relevant NBC BIO
message(s) (set FOXTROT or QUEBEC), and plot it on the map.
                 (b) Step 2. Draw a circle with the attack area radius around the center of
the detection location. The area within this circle represents the attack area and the
hazard area.
                 (c) Step 3. Prepare and transmit an NBC3 BIO report to units and
installations in the predicted hazard area according to the SOP.
     g.    Adjusted Hazard Prediction. When the wind direction does not change by 30° or
more and does not drop below 10 kph, the total downwind distance can be used to calculate
a single hazard area as shown in Figure F-11. The leading and trailing edges should also
be computed, starting at the attack location. The leading and trailing edges should be
displayed with lines drawn perpendicular to the downwind distance path, extending to the
tangent lines. After significant weather changes, the NBC3 BIO report may no longer be
accurate or apply. An adjusted NBC3 BIO report must be sent to the unit or installation in
the new hazard area if possible. Also notify the units that may no longer be in the hazard
area. Significant weather changes are:
     •     Representative downwind speed of 10 kph or more or if the wind speed increases
from less than 10 kph to more than 10 kph or the reverse.
     •    Change in downwind direction by 30° or more.

 Figure F-12. Type Q, Case 2, Attack (1 Hour Into CDR, Changing Downwind Direction)
                 (a) Draw the attack area circle and the initial hazard area for the NBC
CDR time period containing the attack. For a Type S attack, draw the attack area radius
circle centered on the observation location and wait for more information.
                (b) The hazard area at the end of that time period is drawn as a circle
centered at the downwind edge (d1), having a radius equal to the distance along the
perpendicular line from the downwind direction line to one of the tangents.
                  (c)   If the next time period is Case 1 extend this circle by the distance d2.
                (d) If the next time period is Case 2, draw a new downwind direction line
for the new time period of distance d2 from the end of the d1 line. Repeat the triangle
procedure with the circle just drawn being the new attack area.
                (e) Draw the circle containing the hazard area at the end of the second
time period as described for the end of the first time period.
                (f) Construct the hazard area for the third time period as described for
the second time period. For Case 2, use the extended distance (DE) to include the leading
edge.
                (g) The hazard area for the current NBC CDR includes the combined
areas drawn for the initial hazard area and hazard areas associated with the second and
third time periods, if applicable.
        (2) The NBC3 BIO report should be generated by corresponding to the current
NBC CDR time-periods. The hazard area defined in set PAPAX should only include those


2 February 2006    FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                  F-25
points computed for the current NBC CDR, which should be extended to 6 hours from the
time of the attack. In this case, the hazard area for no more than three time periods will
appear in PAPAX.
            (3) The leading and trailing edges are computed along the downwind distance
path, starting at the attack location. The leading and trailing edges should be displayed
with lines drawn perpendicular to the downwind distance path, extending to the tangent
lines for the time period containing each distance.
           (4) For Type S attacks, notice should be taken of the location of enemy
positions further upwind of the hazard area, calculated in accordance with paragraph
7c(2)(d). The area between the enemy positions and the template should be considered as
being potentially biologically contaminated, with appropriate warnings issued and
protective measures taken. If a new detection is made outside the hazard area, the
procedures in 7c(2)(d) should be repeated for the new location.
       h.   Hazards Spanning Multiple CDM Messages.
            (1) Before proceeding to the next CDR, the downwind hazard area should be
recalculated. The third time period for the recalculation is not to be extended, to include the
leading edge, e.g., distance d3 should be used in place of distance DE; however, the leading
and trailing edge distances still need to be computed and plotted as points. Distance (DA)
is also not to be extended to result in 6 hours total time. Rather, d3 will end at the end of
the current CDR (e.g., 2u3). If the attack occurs in the second or third CDR time period,
only one or two distances will result as described in paragraph 7d(3). If actual measured
MET conditions have been recorded during a current NBC CDR, a better estimate of the
current hazard area will be obtained.
           (2) An attack circle for the end of the current NBC CDR is drawn centered at
the current downwind location and then extended to the tangent lines. This attack circle
defines the extent of the cloud at the end of the current NBC CDR. If this circle does not
include the leading and trailing edge distances, the circle radius should be enlarged around
the current downwind location until both points are included.
           (3) The hazard area for the next 6-hour time period should be computed when
the next NBC CDR is received. If the next NBC CDR has not been received, the last time
period for the current NBC CDR should be used for lines WHISKEYM, XRAYM, and
YANKEEM. When the next NBC CDR is received, the hazard prediction should be
recalculated. The hazard area should then be reported in line PAPAX of a new NBC3 BIO
report.
          (4) Hazard areas should continue to be computed until no further
contamination can be confirmed or until the hazard duration that follows has been reached.
Attention should still be paid to the previously calculated areas, which may be
contaminated until the end of agent effectiveness.
     i.    Termination of Biological Hazard Assessment. For biological attack Types P, Q,
and R where the NBC3 BIO report was generated from one or more NBC1 BIO reports with
the biological agent UNK, the NBC3 BIO report computations may be terminated if a
chemical agent is confirmed. Otherwise, biological hazard assessment should continue until
further information is available.

      j.     Hazard Duration. Upon confirmation of a specific biological agent or toxin, the
expected duration of viability of the agent should be recorded in the second field of set
PAPAA. The attack area radius computed for the current NBC CDR should be entered into
the first field of set PAPAA. Agents may continue to be a hazard on the ground in the
contaminated area from days to, potentially, years.
8.      NBC4 BIO Report
      The NBC4 BIO report (see Figure F-13) is the recorded result of an initial detection,
reconnaissance, survey, or monitoring action at a location being checked for the presence of
biological agents. Each line QUEBEC, ROMEO, SIERRA, TANGO, WHISKEY, YANKEE,
and ZULU segment in every NBC4 BIO report is a record of one contamination sample
point location, environment, time of reading, type and level of contamination, method of
sampling, and local MET conditions. The NBC4 BIO report will often be far downwind of
the attack area location as defined in the corresponding NBC2 and NBC3 BIO reports,
since biological agents will most likely be detected as airborne contamination. An NBC4
BIO report can be assumed to be associated with the same attack if —
     •    It can be placed in the hazard area for an NBC3 BIO report between the
expected earliest and latest times of arrival.
     •    It is within 10 km and 2 hours of another NBC4 BIO report, which has already
been assigned to an attack.

9.      NBC5 BIO Report
      The NBC5 BIO report (Figure F-14) is prepared from the contamination plot. This
report is last in order because it consists of a series of grid coordinates. Often, this message
must be sent on the radio nets. This requires lengthy transmission. If an overlay is not
sent, the recipient is required to plot each coordinate and redraw the plot. For NBC5 BIO
reports, lines INDIA (release information), OSCAR (reference time), and XRAYA (actual
contour information) are mandatory.

                                        Appendix G
NUCLEAR-CONTAMINATION AVOIDANCE TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, 

                 AND PROCEDURES

1.   Background
     Under the threat of or in actual nuclear warfare, units continually evaluate the
impact that enemy use of nuclear-weapons could have on the conduct of operations. They
must be prepared for a contingency action to reduce the disruption caused by a nuclear
attack (e.g., establishing a nuclear OEG).
      a.   Casualty-producing levels of fallout can extend to greater distances and cover
greater areas than most other nuclear weapon effects. Such fallout levels can, therefore,
influence actions on the battlefield for a considerable time. Knowledge and understanding
of the nuclear contamination aspects discussed in this appendix help the commander
determine the advantages and disadvantages of each COA open to him in the execution of
assigned missions.
     b.    Fallout areas can be the largest contaminated area produced on the battlefield.
There are two important aspects of fallout prediction—winds aloft and surface winds
determine where fallout will occur. Therefore, the actual location of the fallout can differ
greatly from those that might be expected from the direction of the surface winds.
     c.    Fallout particles are often visible during daylight hours. The arrival and settling
of dust-like particles after a nuclear burst should be assumed to indicate the onset of fallout
unless monitoring shows no radiation in the area. Any precipitation following a nuclear
attack must be regarded as rainout from the nuclear cloud.
      d.    The neutron-induced area is small compared to the fallout area produced by the
same yield nuclear weapon. It is often contained within the area of greatest destruction and
collateral obstacles (e.g., tree blow down, rubble, or fire). Frequently, there will be no need
to enter the neutron-induced area. Units should move into neutron-induced areas only
when necessary. If units are required to pass through GZ or the attack location or to occupy
positions in the immediate vicinity of GZ, the induced radiation is operationally significant.
Units will base their entry and stay times on the radiation level present in the induced
area.
      e.   The dose rate at any location within a contaminated area does not remain
constant. The dose rate decreases with time. Therefore, in time, a radiation hazard will be
of no military significance. The rate at which this decay takes place also varies with time,
generally becoming slower as time passes. The decay rate for contamination in an area
depends on many factors. It generally cannot be determined until several series of dose
rate readings are taken for specific locations within the contaminated area. Standard decay
conditions are, therefore, assumed by all units until actual conditions are determined or
until higher HQ directs otherwise.

2.    Nuclear-Contamination Avoidance Procedures
     Avoidance procedures are broken down into actions before the attack, during the
attack, and after the attack. The lists given, while not all-encompassing, may assist in
developing unit SOPs and directives.
      a.   Preattack.
           (1) Evaluate and monitor enemy nuclear-weapon activities. Reassess threat
and risk, including the following:
           •     Yield of nuclear weapons.
           •     Expected detonation height (high altitude, air, surface, or subsurface).
           •     Likely delivery systems and range.
           •     Nuclear weapons storage facility locations and activity or movement.
           •     Nuclear weapons deployed to the units.
           •     Doctrine for use.
           •     Past use of nuclear weapons and likelihood of use.
           •     Training and exercises in nuclear warfare.
           •     The administration of iodine tablets.
           •    MET and environmental analysis associated with potential delivery means
and identified nuclear weapons.
           •     Expected damage at this location after an attack.
           (2)   Determine the following radiological detection capabilities:
           •     Types of radiation able to detect.
           •     Types of radiation unable to detect.
            •    Concept of operations for detectors, including joint service, HN, and
coalition force assets.
           •     Normal background readings for radiological detectors.
         (3) Determine how many and what types of radiation detection instruments
and support equipment are available for use.
NOTES:
1. Consider the instruments available for use through or by joint service,
coalition, and HN forces.
2. Consider detectors that are at the home station and those scheduled to arrive
via the time-phased force deployment data.
           (4) Determine the following number and type of activities that require
radiological detection:
           •     Dosimeter use (individual use and in main shelter area).
           •     Detection (patient decontamination and mobile reconnaissance teams).



G-2               FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56           2 February 2006
         (5) Use the nomograms and calculations for determining probable hazard
dimensions for nuclear attacks.
         (6) Direct shelter management teams and CBRN reconnaissance teams to take
background readings as follows:
           •     Shelter management teams take readings inside the main living/shelter
areas of the facility, in and around the personnel decontamination station, and in the
immediate area outside of the shelter.
           •   Reconnaissance teams take background readings at locations that may be
used as reconnaissance points (normally not located near shelters) or future radiological
shelters (unmanned at the present time).
         (7) Develop a concept of operations for the use of radiological detection
instruments. Use the following techniques as guidelines:
           •      Shelter teams will only take readings outside the shelter until the point is
reached where a reading (however small) can be measured inside the main living/shelter
area of the facility.
NOTE: Once this point has been reached, the protection factor (PF) or CF of the
shelter can be determined by dividing the outside reading by the inside reading.
For example, the PF/CF of a shelter would be 50 if the outside reading was 1
cGy/hr and the inside reading was 0.02 cGy/hr.
          •     CBRN reconnaissance teams will not be used to take survey readings
outside unless the information is critical to the mission operations.
NOTE: In all cases (for individuals, CBRN reconnaissance teams, and shelter
management team members), the goal will be to limit radiological exposure to the
absolute minimum required to accomplish critical mission operations.
          (8) Provide specific visual aids and current information to ensure that all
personnel are familiar with the following:
           •      Individual protective actions.
           •      Radiation signs/symptoms.
           •      Iodine tablets.
     b.    During Attack.
           (1)    Take action for personnel in an open area.
           •      Seek the best available protection (building, bunker).
           •    Move to a ditch, depression, or structure that provides protection from the
blast, fragments, and small arms fire (if a building or bunker is not available).
           •    Drop to the ground, crawl to the closest available protection, and don IPE
according to the unit SOP or OPORD if no warning is received and an attack begins.
           •     Use any available material to provide overhead cover (rain gear, poncho,
tarps, or plastic).
NOTE: Adjust to the local policies and procedures.



2 February 2006        FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                G-3
           (2)   Perform buddy checks, ensuring that IPE is correctly worn.
           (3)   Perform self-aid/buddy aid while maintaining a low profile.
           (4)   Close doors and windows, and cover items with plastic if time allows.
           (5)   Monitor and report the following attack indicators to the CBRN cell:
           •     Detector response.
           •     Casualty data.
           •     Environmental data.
           (6)   Monitor the CBRNWRS for reports of a CBRN attack.
      c.   Postattack.
          (1) Predict the downwind hazard area of the nuclear detonations and fallout,
and predict the radiation intensities.
           (2)   Ensure that personnel cover their exposed skin while outside.
           (3) Ensure that personnel protect themselves from ingesting or inhaling the
radioactive particles while outside.
           (4)   Ensure that the total accumulated gamma dose is kept under 125 cGy per
person.
NOTE: The installation commander may adjust this limit, as necessary, to
accomplish critical mission operations.
           (5) Avoid sending people outside when fallout is accumulating or radiation
intensity has not reached a safe level.
         (6)     Monitor the area for radioactive fallout, and forward information to the
CBRN cell.
           •     Continuously monitor for gamma radiation when fallout is expected.
           •     Identify the exact time of the arrival and forward it to the CBRN cell.
           •    Monitor and record the intensity readings every 15 minutes until the
radiation peaks.
           •     Monitor and record the intensity readings every hour after the radiation
peaks.
NOTE: If an increase is noted, resume monitoring every 15 minutes until a new
peak is identified.
           (7) Verify or determine the PF or CF of the shelters by dividing the outside
intensity reading by the inside intensity reading on the radiac equipment (e.g., 300 cGy/hr
divided by 30 cGy/hr = PF or CF of 10).
           (8)   Activate the decontamination teams, and proceed with the decontamination
as directed.
NOTE: Ensure that the decontamination teams are dispatched with dosimeters
and that their total radiation doses are tracked and kept to a minimum for each
task.


G-4               FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56          2 February 2006
          (9)     Directly decontaminate the area by using the following methods:
           •    Covering. Eight centimeters (3 inches) of earth will decrease radiation dose
rates by one-half because of the shielding provided by the soil.
           •    Brushing or Vacuuming. This is effective on personnel and paved or
finished surfaces. Use brooms, brushes, and vacuums inside shelters and on personnel.
Street sweepers are ideal for roadways and flight lines.
           •   Scraping. Remove firm soil and snow by scraping. Move contaminated
waste as far away as possible.
           •   Washing. Hot water and detergent are effective on wood, roofing material,
masonry products, steel surfaces, asphalt, and concrete. Use a fire hose or power-driven
decontamination apparatus to loosen and flush away fallout particles. Scrubbing with
brooms, followed by rinsing, produces excellent results on paved surfaces.
NOTES:
1. Radioactive contamination cannot be neutralized; it only can be removed,
covered, or isolated.
2. Items exposed to the fallout do not become radioactive themselves. Remove
the fallout, and check with radiacs to determine if an item is safe to use.
           (10) Determine the radiation decay rate based on the amount of time since the
radiation peak and the current gamma radiation intensity.
NOTE: This information is vital for planning military operations.
          (11) Monitor the individual radiological records.
          (12) Monitor the shelter radiological logs.
          (13) Direct the resupply, restocking, or redistribution of the following:
          •       Munitions/ammunition.
          •       POL.
          •       First aid items.
          •       IPE.
          •       Iodine tablets.
          •       Food and water.
          •       Batteries.
          •       Contamination control and decontamination assets.
3.   Nuclear Information Management
      Managing nuclear-attack information is crucial for the success of a command. To be
useful, nuclear information must be collected, reported, and evaluated. Once evaluated, it
can be used as battlefield intelligence. Obtaining and converting nuclear information into
usable nuclear intelligence does not just happen. The volume of information that needs to
be collected and reported could easily disrupt communications and tactical operations if not




2 February 2006          FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56           G-5
properly managed. This section describes what information is available and how that
information is transmitted to the person or unit requiring it.
      a.   Collection of Nuclear Information. The first step in managing nuclear attack
information is to determine what information is available and who is available to collect it.
Two types of data must be collected. Observer data provides information that a nuclear
attack has occurred. Monitoring, survey, and reconnaissance data provides information on
where the hazard is located. Every unit is responsible for observing and recording nuclear
attacks, but every unit does not automatically forward NBC1 NUC reports. Many units
may observe a nuclear burst, but if every unit forwarded a report, communications would
be overwhelmed. For this reason, only selected units with the equipment that can make
accurate measurements will submit NBC1 NUC reports. These units are called designated
observers. Additional units are selected during tactical operations based on their physical
locations. Only selected units automatically submit NBC1 NUC reports to the CBRN cell.
      b.   Monitoring, Survey, and Reconnaissance Data.
           (1) NBC1 NUC reports allow the CBRN cell to collect information on where
designated observers have seen a nuclear attack. The CBRN cell then evaluates this
information in the form of an NBC2 NUC report. From the NBC2 NUC report, a simplified
or detailed hazard prediction can be made. This prediction (NBC3 NUC report) is only an
estimation of the hazard area. Feedback is needed from the units to determine exactly
where the contamination is located. This feedback comes from monitoring, survey, and
reconnaissance (NBC4 NUC reports). Monitoring and reconnaissance operations give the
initial CBRN hazard location to the CBRN cell. Initial monitoring and reconnaissance
reports are generally forwarded through the intelligence channels to the CBRN cell. This
information may also be sent to the CBRN cell by the use of the various DSTs as discussed
in Chapter III.
           (2) The CBRN cell then plots the information on the situation map. If more
information is needed, the CBRN cell directs a unit (picked because of its location and
capability) to collect and forward the necessary data. This information could be from
additional monitoring reports or a survey of the area in question. Collecting nuclear
information is a joint effort of the unit and the CBRN cell. The unit actually collects the
information. The CBRN cell plans and directs the collection effort. More detailed
information concerning the collection effort is addressed in Multiservice Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance.
      c.   Evaluation of Nuclear Information. After the nuclear data has been collected, it
is evaluated. It is then used as battlefield intelligence. The CBRN cell is the primary
evaluation center. Units and intermediate HQ use this raw data to develop nuclear
intelligence for their own use until detailed results are available from the CBRN cell.
     d.   Transmission of Nuclear Information. Procedures used to transmit nuclear
information to and from the CBRN cell are an important part of IM. The method of
transmitting information depends on the tactical situation and the mission of the unit.
Refer to Chapter III for more detailed information.
      e.   Designated Observer System. Although all units have some
information-gathering responsibilities, certain units, because of their capabilities and
location, are chosen as designated observers for nuclear attacks. Designated observers
must be accurate when providing data on a nuclear burst. Observers are selected to



G-6              FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56         2 February 2006
provide total coverage over the entire AOI. This requires ground and aerial observers. The
designated observer system provides the essential data to prepare hazard location
predictions and nuclear damage assessments. It provides raw observer data, using a
standard report format. The CBRN cell specifies the primary and alternate means of
communication.
             (1)   Designated Ground-Based Observers.
                (a) Ground units are selected for the designated observer system based on
the following factors:
                   •   Battlefield location.
                   •   Communication nets available.
                   •   Mission (current and future) interference due to enemy action.
                   •   Training and experience.
                   •   Anticipated reliability of data.
                   •   Possession of organic angle measuring equipment.
               (b) Field artillery and air defense artillery units are best-suited as
designated observer units. These units have organic optical equipment ideal for sighting
measurements. These items are listed below in order of preference (Figure G-1).
               •    M2 aiming circle (this equipment is preferred because it is set to GN
and measures in mils).
                   •   M65 or M43 battery command periscope.
                   •   T16 or T2 theodolite.
                   •   M2 pocket transit.

types of radar can define the nuclear cloud. Field artillery and air defense artillery radars
are positioned in the division and corps areas.
           (2)   Designated Aerial Observers.
                (a) Aircraft provide excellent observer coverage for nuclear attacks. The
CBRN control center coordinates with the appropriate aviation officers to have several
aircraft crews designated as observers. The aviation unit commander selects the crews.
Designated aircrews are instructed to report the type of attack and when and where it
occurred. If aviators measure the cloud parameters, they must also provide the location
from which it was measured.
                (b) Aviators have the advantage of height. They are able to see and
report actual GZ locations. They also can see and estimate crater width. Such data is
usually not obtainable from ground observer units.
     f.    Nondesignated Observers. All units are required to record (in the prescribed
format) their observations concerning nuclear strikes. Nondesignated observer units that
have not been specifically tasked will transmit their reports only upon request. However,
these units must report a nuclear attack only to the next higher HQ according to the local
SOP.
      g.   Determination That a Nuclear Attack has Occurred.
           (1) The development of a nuclear cloud is divided into three stages—fireball,
burst cloud, and stabilized cloud. The fireball stage exists from the instant of the explosion
until the generally spherical cloud of explosion products ceases to radiate a brilliant light.
During this stage, do not look at the fireball. The brilliant light can cause permanent
damage to the eyes.
           (2) As the brilliant light fades to a dull reddish glow, the fireball stage
transforms into the nuclear-burst cloud stage. At this point the cloud can be safely
observed. The cloud may be a spherical cloud (high airburst) or a mushroom type cloud,
with or without a stem (low air or surface burst). Relatively low-yield nuclear surface
bursts have clouds similar to a surface burst of a conventional explosive. Severe turbulence
and rapid growth in cloud height and width are characteristics of this stage.
           (3) When the cloud ceases to grow in height, the stabilized cloud stage begins.
Height stabilization occurs from about 4 to 14 minutes after the explosion, depending on
the yield. The nuclear burst angular cloud width (line LIMA, as explained in Chapter III
for an NBC1 NUC report) and stabilized cloud top/bottom angle or height (line MIKE) are
measured during this stage. Figure G-2 illustrates the growth of a nuclear cloud. After the
height stabilization, the cloud continues to grow. This is due to wind, not nuclear energy.
For this reason, cloud measurements are not taken after H+10 minutes. Measurements of
the nuclear-burst cloud are taken at H+5 minutes (line LIMA) or at H+10 minutes (line
MIKE).

            (4) Nuclear-cloud measurements (parameters) have been correlated with the
yield of the weapon. This information can be extracted from nomograms and the
ABC-M4A1 nuclear yield calculator. The use of the nomograms and the ABC-M4A1 is
described in more detail later in this appendix.
            (5) Unit SOPs detail the duties and circumstances concerning when and how
measurements are taken. For accuracy, the following list of measurements (in order of
reliability) is provided to aid in SOP development:
                   (a)   Nuclear-burst angular cloud width at H+5 minutes.
                   (b)   Stabilized cloud top or cloud bottom height at H+10 minutes.
                   (c)   Stabilized cloud top or cloud bottom angle at H+10 minutes.
4.   NBC1 NUC Report
     The NBC1 NUC report can have the most far-reaching consequences of all NBC
reports.
     a.    Introduction. The NBC1 NUC report (Figure G-3, page G-10) is the most widely
used report. The observing unit uses this report to provide nuclear-attack data. All units
must be familiar with the NBC1 NUC report format and its information. The unit must
prepare this report quickly and accurately and send it to the next higher HQ. The battalion
(squadron) and higher elements decide which NBC1 NUC reports to forward to the next
higher HQ. If several reports are received on the same nuclear attack, then a consolidated
NBC1 NUC report is forwarded instead of separate reports. This reduces the number of
reports to a manageable level. The data in an NBC1 NUC report is used to locate GZ and to
determine the yield of the nuclear burst.

           (1)    Purpose. The purpose of the NBC1 NUC report is to provide nuclear-attack
data.
            (2) Message Precedence. The first time a nuclear weapon is used against US
forces, the designated unit will send the NBC1 NUC report with a FLASH precedence. If a
previous NBC1 NUC report has been forwarded, an IMMEDIATE precedence will be used.
      b.   Observer Position. Use universal transverse mercator (UTM) coordinates
latitude (LAT) and longitude (LONG) or a place name. Enter this location on line BRAVO of
the NBC1 NUC report. Line BRAVO is required on all reports from ground observers and
should be encoded. This is the location of the angle-measuring equipment. It may or may
not be the unit location. The direction of the attack from the observing unit is also reported
on this line.

     c.    DTG of the Attack.
         (1) After the second shock wave has passed, uncover the eyes and record the
DTG to the nearest minute. This data is entered as line DELTA of the NBC1 NUC report.
            (2) The DTG of the attack is always reported. The time zone used is specified
by the field SOP, OPLAN, or OPORD or is contained in other instructions. The CBRN cell
conducts time checks with the designated observers and converts all times to Zulu time.
      d.   Attack Location or GZ. If the designated observer has an actual location, this
will be transmitted on line FOXTROT. If the attack location is estimated, a detailed
description of how the estimation was made should be transmitted on line GENTEXT. A
detailed description of how the CBRN cell calculates the GZ location is covered in
paragraph 5 of this appendix.
      e.   Type of Burst. Observe the developing cloud to see if the burst was an airburst
by noting the shape and color of the cloud or the absence of a stem. If the cloud is lighter in
color than the stem or if the stem is ragged or broken (does not solidly connect with the
cloud), record “air” in line HOTEL of the NBC1 NUC report. If the stem is thick and dark
and it connects with the cloud, record “surface” in line HOTEL. If the cloud does not match
any mental image for air or surface, record “unknown” in line HOTEL. “Unknown” may
also be recorded when the attack occurs at night. A subsurface burst is recorded as
“surface” only if the detonation ruptures the surface.
      f.    Flash-to-Bang Time. The designated observers will be assigned to report the
flash-to-bang time. At the instant of the blue-white flash, cover your eyes, hit the ground,
and start counting slowly (1,000 and 1, 1,000 and 2, 1,000 and 3, and so on) until the arrival
of the shock wave or bang. Make a mental note of the count on which the shock wave
arrives (for example, 1,000 and 4). If the observer has a watch and can note the exact time
(in seconds), the watch can be used to record the flash-to-bang time. This data is entered as
line JULIET on the NBC1 NUC report. Remain in place until the debris has stopped
falling. It must be noted that there will be two shock waves—one blowing in one direction
and the other blowing a few moments later in the opposite direction. If the bang is not
heard in 5 minutes (a count of 1,000 and 300), continue with other measurements below.
      g.    Angular Cloud Width. The angular width of the cloud is measured 5 minutes
after the detonation. The width of the nuclear cloud is the angular dimension, in mils or
degrees, of the cloud diameter. The optical equipment operator takes this measurement at
H+5 minutes. This measurement is made for nuclear clouds resulting from air and surface
bursts. All units have some ability to take this measurement. The lensatic compass should
be used if the listed equipment (Figure G-1, page G-7) is not available. Take the
measurement of the angle by measuring the right and left side of the nuclear cloud. The
numerical difference between these azimuths is the angular cloud width (Figure G-4, page
G-12). This measurement is reported as line LIMA.

     h.    Cloud Top or Cloud Bottom Height. The cloud top or bottom height can only be
measured by aircraft or radar. Helicopters and most small, fixed-wing aircraft have a
limited capability to determine the cloud height. The CBRN cell may have to coordinate
with other service liaison officers to make arrangements to measure the cloud height.
Again, CBRN cell coordination is required to establish this data source. Radar may also be
helpful in resolving the actual number of bursts and GZs. This measurement is taken at
H+10 and reported on line MIKE, in feet or km (Figure G-5).

       i.   Stabilized Cloud Top Angle.
          (1) The cloud top angle is the vertical measurement, in mils or degrees, from
the GZ level (or from ground level if the GZ level is unknown), to the cloud top. This
measurement is taken at H+10 minutes and reported in line MIKE (see Figure G-3, page G­
10).
          (2) These measurements are less reliable than measurements made at H+5
minutes. Most units in the field cannot take cloud bottom or top angle measurements.
Therefore, they are not normally designated as observer units. These measurements
cannot be made with a lensatic compass.

          (3) If the angular width of the cloud cannot be measured, the designated
observer unit measures the cloud bottom or cloud top angle. Nondesignated observer units
with angle-measuring equipment can also take this measurement.
           (4) The individuals specifically tasked to take the cloud measurements report
this data and other data specified in the unit SOP to the unit CBRN defense team. If the
unit is a designated observer, the defense team will format the data into an NBC1 NUC
report. The report is transmitted per the SOP or by other written directions.
      j.   Stabilized Cloud Bottom Angle. The cloud bottom angle measurement is the
vertical angle (in mils or degrees) measured from the GZ level (or ground level if the GZ
level is unknown) to the point of intersection of the stabilized cloud and the stem. The
cloud bottom or top angle measurements are not taken for airbursts. This measurement is
taken at H+10 minutes and reported in line MIKE (Figure G-3, page G-10).
5.   NBC2 NUC Report
       a.  Introduction. The NBC2 NUC report reflects the evaluated nuclear-burst data.
It is based on one or more NBC1 NUC reports. NBC2 NUC reports are created for all air,
surface, and unknown types of bursts. When surface or unknown bursts are reported,
fallout predictions are made. Users of NBC2 NUC reports are not limited to the use of the
line items shown in Figure G-6, page G-14. Any other line items may be added as
appropriate.
           (1) Purpose. The purpose of the NBC2 NUC report is to pass the evaluated
data to higher, subordinate, and adjacent units.
           (2) Message Precedence. All other messages (after the initial NBC1 NUC
report has been sent) should be given a precedence, which reflects the operational value of
the contents. Normally IMMEDIATE would be appropriate.
          (3) The division (or designated higher HQ) CBRN cell, after determining the
estimated yield, prepares the NBC2 NUC report, assigns it a strike serial number, and
disseminates it to the appropriate units.
           (4) Subsequent data may be received after the NBC2 NUC report is sent. If
this data changes the yield or GZ location, send this data in an NBC2 NUC update report.
Use the same strike serial number and DTG of attack.
     b.   Strike Serial Number.
           (1) The CBRN cell serves as a focal point for all requests for information
concerning nuclear strikes. It is responsible for assigning a strike serial number to each
nuclear attack (friendly or enemy) that occurs within its assigned area.
           (2) Once the unit receives the NBC2 NUC report, the unit CBRN defense team
takes the report and a current EDM (see Appendix D for further information concerning
EDMs) and prepares a simplified fallout.

       c.     Location of GZ (Line FOXTROT).
           (1) Any unit that is not part of the designated-observer system is obligated to
take the cloud measurements and record all observed burst data. This data is recorded in
the NBC1 NUC report in line BRAVO or FOXTROT and evaluated for the NBC2 NUC
report. The unit does not report to higher HQ unless specifically requested. The CBRN cell
will use this data to locate GZ and to estimate the yield.
           (2) At the unit level, GZ is located in one of three ways—direct observation,
intersection, or polar plot.
                  (a) Direct Observation. For small-yield weapons, direct observation may
provide the actual GZ location. However, units do not reconnoiter for the GZ location. If
GZ cannot be observed, measure the azimuth from the observer to the center of the stem
(surface burst) or nuclear-burst cloud (air burst). Enter this data in line BRAVO of the
NBC1 NUC report. If GZ can be observed, determine the UTM, LAT, and LONG
coordinates or the place name. Enter this data as line FOXTROT (actual). Aerial observers
may provide an estimated or actual GZ, depending on the altitude, orientation, terrain, and
visibility conditions. The GZ must be observed to use line FOXTROT (actual).
               (b)     Intersection (Estimation for Line FOXTROT). The principal GZ
location method is a plot of intersecting azimuths sent by the designated observers. The
procedures are as follows:
               •    Locate and mark the position of each observer unit on the operations
map overlay using the data on line BRAVO.


G-14                 FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                       2 February 2006
            •      Determine each azimuth to be plotted. This information is also on line
BRAVO. Convert all magnetic azimuths to grid azimuths.
                  •   Mark each azimuth from each observer position using a protractor.
                 •     Extend each azimuth to the distance necessary for the observer’s
positions to intersect.
                  •     Post any data that assists in the determination of the GZ location
(e.g., radar, pilot reports).
                 •    Evaluate the data. The result of the intersecting azimuths is an
estimation of the location of GZ. The GZ location is reported on the NBC2 NUC report on
line FOXTROT, qualified with the word estimated (unless FOXTROT [actual] information
is used in the determination).
                  •   Disregard the azimuths that do not intersect with the other azimuths.
               •     Take the center of the plot as the estimated GZ location whenever
azimuths do not cross to form a clear GZ location.
                (c) Polar Plot (Estimation for Line FOXTROT). Polar plot techniques are
based on flash-to-bang time and the speed of sound (350 meters per second or 0.35 km per
second). The procedures are as follows (see Figure G-7, page G-16):
               •    Make an approximation of the distance between GZ and the observer
in km by multiplying the flash-to-bang time (data on line JULIET of the NBC1 NUC report)
by 0.35 km per second.
             •    Plot the observer’s location on the situation map. This is line BRAVO
on the NBC1 NUC report.
                •    Mark the azimuth from the observer’s position to the attack location
using a protractor. Convert the magnetic azimuth to a grid azimuth.
              •    Draw this azimuth to the length previously calculated as the distance
between GZ and the observer.
                •    Read the grid coordinates of the place where the azimuth line, in the
previous step, ends. This is an approximate plot of the GZ location.

     d.   Methods of Determining the Yield (Line NOVEMBER). Before the yield can be
estimated, the location of GZ, position of the observer, and DTG cloud measurements were
taken must be known. The nuclear-burst parameters are presented in nomograms. Each
nomogram is an independent means of estimating yield. The following are methods for
determining yield, from the most accurate to the least accurate:
         (1) The distance in km between GZ and the observer, in conjunction with line
LIMA or MIKE information, represents the best method of estimating the yield.
          (2) Use Figure G-8 to determine the yield, based on the nuclear-burst angular
cloud width and the distance between GZ (or line JULIET, flash-to-bang time) and the
observer. The data is reported in line LIMA.
               (a)   The right-hand scale is the nuclear-burst angular cloud width, in mils
and degrees.
               (b)   The center scale is the distance in km between GZ and the observer.
               (c)   The left-hand scale is the yield, in KT.
                 (d) To use this nomogram, place a hairline from the point on the
right-hand scale (representing the nuclear burst angular cloud width at H+5 minutes)
through the point on the center scale (representing the distance between GZ and the
observer) (or line item JULIET, flash-to-bang time). Read the yield where the hairline
crosses the yield scale (left). You must be as exact as possible.
          (3) The cloud top or cloud bottom height, when stabilized, can be closely
measured by aircraft or air defense artillery (ADA) radar. Measurements, in meters or feet
above the earth’s surface, must be made at H+10 minutes. The data is reported in line
MIKE.
                (a) Use Figure G-9, page G-18, to correlate these measurements with the
yield. The distance between GZ and the observer is not required.
               (b)   The extreme left and right scales on the nomogram are yield, in KT
and MT.

               (c) The scale second from the left is the cloud top height at H+10 minutes,

                (d) The scale third from the left is the cloud bottom height at H+10
minutes, in thousands (103) of meters or feet.
                  (e) The other scales on the nomogram, (2/3 stem height, cloud radius, and
time of fall) are not used in the yield estimation. These scales are used in the detailed
fallout prediction.
                 (f) To use the nomogram, determine the stabilized cloud top or cloud
bottom height from line MIKE of the NBC1 NUC report. Place a hairline directly over the
reported data, and pin the hairline to the nomogram. Pivot the hairline until it crosses the
outside yield scales at the same value (far left and far right). This value is the estimated
yield.
           (4) Given the distance between GZ and the observer and the stabilized cloud
top angle or cloud bottom angle, use Figure G-10, page G-20, to determine the yield. The
data is reported in line MIKE.
                (a) The right-hand scale gives the distance in km from GZ to the observer
and the flash-to-bang time, in seconds, counted by the observer.
                  (b)   The center scale is the cloud top or cloud bottom angle, in mils or
degrees.
                  (c) The left-hand scale is actually two scales. The left side of the scale
lists the yields to be read when using the cloud bottom angle; the right side of the scale lists
the yields to be read when using the cloud top angle.
                 (d) To use this nomogram, place a hairline through the point on the
right-hand scale, representing the distance between GZ and the observer, and through the
point on the center scale, representing the cloud top or cloud bottom angle. At the point of
intersection of the hairline and the left-hand scale, read the yield. If the cloud top angle
was used on the center scale, read the yield on the right side of the left-hand scale titled

left-hand scale titled yield–cloud bottom (KT).
           (5) The M4A1 calculator (Figure G-11, page G-21) is designed to provide a
rapid yield estimation based on any parameter except the cloud top or cloud bottom height.
The M4A1 consists of three plastic disks (front, back, and middle) connected by a rivet. The
front and back disks are opaque white plastic in the center and transparent plastic on the
outer edge. The middle disk is opaque white plastic.

                  •       Instructions.
                 (c) The M4A1 calculator is a round nomogram with a fixed hairline.
Because of this, there are situations in which the yield pointer may go off scale on the high
or low ends of the yield scale. (Example: the nuclear cloud is 20 mils wide and the flash-to­
bang time was 10 seconds. This is a small cloud that is very close to the observer,
indicating a small yield. The calculator shows a yield of 1,000 KT, but the actual yield is
less than 0.02 KT).
                (d) To use the M4A1, determine the yield utilizing the flash-to-bang time
and the angle to the cloud top.
                •     Situation. An observer reports a flash-to-bang time of 100 seconds
and the elevation of the cloud top at the stabilization time of 300 mils.
                  •       Task. Using the calculator, determine the yield from the burst.
                 •    Solution. Align 100 seconds on the flash-to-bang time scale, with 300
mils on the stabilized cloud bottom or top elevation angle scale (H+10/M information).
Read the yield on the yield-stabilized cloud top scale that falls under the indexing pointer.
The yield of the observed weapon is 20 KT.
                  (e)     Yield from Flash-to-Bang Time and Cloud Width at 5 Mins (H+5/L).
NOTE: If line LIMA is reported in degrees, it must be converted to mils; mils
equals degrees x 17.8.
               •    Situation. An observer reports that the flash-to-bang time from a
burst was 100 seconds and the cloud width at 5 minutes was 180 mils.
                  •       Task. Using the calculator, determine the yield.
                •    Solution. Align 100 seconds on the flash-to-bang time scale with 180
mils on the observed cloud width at 5 mins scale. Read the yield at the point where the
indexing pointer aligns with the yield scale.
                  •       The yield of the observed weapon is 50 KT.
            (6)   The flash-to-bang time is only used to estimate the yield as a last resort.
            (7) Each of the yield estimation techniques was given in order of decreasing
reliability, with the results providing approximate yields.
            (8) When data from several observers, concerning a single attack, does not
result in the same yield, add all yields together and divide by the number of observers to
get the average estimated yield. This is the yield that is transmitted.
6.     NBC3 NUC Calculation Procedures
     NBC3 NUC calculation procedures ensure that standard methods are used when
determining fallout.
       a.   Fallout Prediction.
            (1)   In the preparation of a fallout prediction, the following must be available:
            •     MET data.



G-22                  FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56      2 February 2006
           •      GZ location.
           •      Estimated yield.
        (2) The necessary MET data will be available in the format of an NBC BWM or
an NBC EDM. Refer to Appendix D for further information concerning NBC BWMs and
NBC EDMs.
            (3) The method of fallout prediction consists of two procedures: the simplified
procedure and the detailed procedure. Both are used to determine the extent of the
warning area. Normally, the detailed procedure is used by agencies having a MET
capability, and subordinate units use the simplified procedure. The decision on which
procedure to use is left to the commanders concerned. These two procedures are described
in detail later in this appendix.
           (4) The prediction of the fallout hazard area using the detailed procedure is
more accurate. Although neither procedure precisely defines the extent of the fallout, the
predicted fallout area, calculated by either method, indicates the probable limits to which
the fallout of military significance will extend.
          (5) The boundaries of the predicted fallout area are not dose rate contour lines,
nor do they imply that all points within the enclosed areas will sustain dangerous fallout.
NOTE: No fallout predictions are made for air bursts over land, and the
procedures are not used for surface bursts over water.
     b.    Fallout Area Zones.
           (1)    The predicted fallout area consists of Zone I and Zone II.
                 (a) Zone I is an immediate operational concern. Within this zone,
there will be areas where exposed, unprotected personnel may receive doses of 125 cGy
or greater in relatively short periods of time (less than 4 hours after the actual arrival of
fallout). Casualties and major disruptions to the unit operations may occur in some
parts of this zone.
                 (b) Zone II is a secondary hazard. Within this zone, the total dose
received by exposed, unprotected personnel is not expected to reach 125 cGy within a
period of 4 hours after the actual arrival of fallout. Within this zone, personnel may
receive a total dose of 75 cGy or greater within the first 24 hours after the arrival of
fallout. Personnel with no previous radiation exposure may be permitted to continue
critical missions for as long as 4 hours after the actual arrival of fallout without
incurring the 125 cGy emergency risk dose.
            (2) Outside the two predicted zones, exposed, unprotected personnel may
receive a total dose that does not reach 75 cGy in the first 24 hours after the actual
arrival of fallout.
          (3) The total dose for an infinite stay time should not reach 125 cGy. Refer
to Appendix C for more details.
NOTE: The prediction of fallout is to be regarded as an estimate only. The
necessary preparations should be made to avoid the hazard if tactically possible.
Even within Zone I, units may not be affected by the fallout at all. However, the
decision to act is up to the local commander and national directives or SOPs.



2 February 2006       FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                  G-23
       c.   Significance of the Fallout Ashore Versus at Sea.
          (1) The detailed procedure and the simplified procedure for fallout prediction
are intended for use by all services. They are based on assumed land surface bursts. It is
recognized that the fallout from a sea burst may be rather different, but very little direct
information is available on the fallout from bursts on the surface of deep ocean water.
           (2) It must be stressed that the sea acts like an absorbent of and shield against
radioactive products, but they remain a hazard on land until they have decayed.
          (3) Another important difference is that recipients of warnings ashore do not
have the mobility of ships at sea. Therefore, ships will be particularly interested in the
determination of the approximate area in which deposition of fallout at the surface is
taking place at a given time after the burst.
           (4) Ships with a MET capability may be able to obtain the required MET data
for computation of NBC EDM using the standard pressure level winds. Basic wind data for
this purpose are generally available from MET sources (airbases, MET ships, or mobile
weather stations). Ships, which do not have a MET capability, will normally predict the
fallout areas by using the simplified procedure.
           (5) The fallout warning system (MERWARN) for merchant ships at sea is
described later in this appendix.
       d.   Multiple-Burst Fallout.
           (1) No additional prediction procedure is available in the case of multiple-burst
fallout. The information obtained in areas where zones overlap is to be interpreted as
follows:
                (a) The hazard classification of an area where fallout prediction patterns
overlap should be that of the higher classification involved. That is, an overlap area
involving Zone I should be designated Zone I and an overlap area involving nothing more
than Zone II should be designated Zone II (see Figure G-12).
                 (b)     Examples:
                 •     Zone I overlapping Zone I, designate Zone I.
                 •     Zone I overlapping Zone II, designate Zone I.
                 •     Zone II overlapping Zone II, designate Zone II.
                 •     Zone II overlapping Zone I, designate Zone I.
       e.   Simplified Fallout Prediction.
          (1) Purpose. The purpose of the simplified fallout prediction system is to
provide small-unit commanders with an immediate estimate of the fallout hazard. The
commander will use the simplified fallout prediction in the tactical decision-making
process.

 on.

 ZULUM (ddttttZMMMYYYY) is the DTG at which the real winds for the wind vector plot
 were measured (e.g., 020600ZJUN2004 is the 2nd day of June 2004 at 0600Z ).
 UNIT (LLL/DDD/SSS/-//) are the units of measurement being used (e.g., LLL = (KM), DDD
 = degrees grid (DGG), and SSS = KPH). DDD is the effective downwind direction in
 degrees, and SSS is the effective downwind speed in kph (e.g., ALPHAM 080025 is a
 downwind direction of 80 degrees, and 25 is an effective downwind speed of 25 kph, valid
 for yields of 2 KT or less. If ALPHAM was 004, LLL ( /-/ ) would be the downwind distance
 of Zone I (4 km).
            (4) M5A2 Fallout Predictor. The M5A2 fallout predictor is a transparent
 device used to outline the zones of hazard resulting from surface bursts for the preselected
 yield groups.
               (a) The M5A2 fallout predictor is composed of two simple predictors and a
 nomogram for determining the downwind distance of Zone I.
                 (b) One predictor is drawn to a scale of 1:50,000; the other predictor is
 drawn to a scale of 1:250,000. Each predictor contains preselected yield groups (A, B, C, D,
 and E—1:50,000 and A, B, C, D, E, and F—1:250,000). Each simplified predictor consists of
 three major parts:
                 •       Azimuth dial for orientation.
                •     Semicircles depicting stabilized nuclear-cloud radii drawn around GZ.
 This shows the area of contamination for each of the preselected yield groups.
                 •     A map scale calibrated in km along two radial lines extending out

 from the center of the azimuth dial.

           (5) Types and Cases of Simplified Fallout Prediction. There are three cases for
simplified fallout prediction: one is normal and two are special. They are defined by the
number of digits that are contained on the specific yield group being used.
                 (a) Six Digits, Normal Case. Under normal conditions, the wind speed
will be 8 kph or more. When wind speeds are 8 kph or greater (>8 kph), 6 digits will be
given on the EDM. These 6 digits are used to prepare the simplified fallout prediction. To
prepare a simplified fallout prediction depicting a 6-digit normal case, see Figure G-12,
page G-25.
               •     Determine the yield of the weapon. This information is located on line
NOVEMBER of the NBC2 NUC report.
               •     Use the yield and determine which line of the EDM will be used to
prepare the simplified fallout prediction.
Example: 50 KT = Line DELTA of the EDM; the yield is more than 30 KT, but less than
100 KT.
                     DELTA        is    >    30 KT       ≤      100 KT
                •     Utilize the first three digits (ddd) from the EDM, and draw a line from
GZ, through the appropriate wind direction on the azimuth dial. Label this GN. Record the
downwind direction (ddd) on the M5A2.
                •     Utilize the EWS (sss on EDM) and the yield (not the yield group), and
determine the downwind distance zone of immediate concern (see Figure G-16, page G-32).
Align the two known values (EWS and yield). This will allow the reading of the Zone I
distance.
                •     Draw an arc between the radial lines of the predictor at the
appropriate distance downwind from GZ for Zone I. Double this distance, and draw a
second arc downwind from GZ for Zone II. Zone II is always twice Zone I. Label Zone I and
Zone II.
                •     Draw left and right tangents from the cloud radius line for the yield
group to the points of the intersection of the radial lines and Zone I arc of the predictor.
                •     Draw a series of dashed arcs at distances equal to the EWS (sss)
within Zones I and II. For example, EWS = 15 kph, then H+1 (1 hour after the burst)
would be drawn (dashed arc) at 15 km, H+2 at 30 km, and H+3 at 30 km. However, if the
extent of Zone II were 29 km, then (in this example) there would be only two time-of-arrival
arcs (H+1 and H+2). If a time-of-arrival arc coincides with a zone boundary, extend the
zone boundary with a dashed line and label it with the appropriate time of arrival (e.g.,
H+2 and extent of Zone II were 30 km).
                •     Place the center of the azimuth dial on the predictor over the
estimated GZ on the map. Rotate the predictor around the GZ point until the GN line is
pointing toward GN.
                •     The predictor is now oriented, and the area predicted to be covered by
fallout can now be evaluated.
                 (b) Three Digits, Circular Special Case. Generally, when the wind speed
is less than 8 kph, fallout will not go in a definite direction and will return primarily
around GZ. The following is how to prepare a simplified fallout prediction depicting a 3­
digit circular case:

  Situation: Determine the downwind distance of Zone I. 

  -EWS from line YANKEE of the NBC2 Report is 029 km/h. 

  -Estimated yield from line NOVEMBER of the NBC2 Report is 35 KT. 

  -Align the hairline from left to right, placing it on 29 km/h, keeping the hairline in place at 29 

  km/h; align it also with the yield of 35 KT on the left scale. 

  Read the middle scale for the distance to Zone I of 33 km. Note that this will be rounded to 

  the nearest whole number. NOTE: Hairline may not be to scale.

               •   Whenever wind speeds are less than 8 kph three (LLL) digits will
appear on the EDM line item. This indicates the prediction will have a circular pattern.
                •  At GZ on the M5A2 predictor, draw a circle equal to the radius
reported on the EDM. Label this radius Zone I.
                •     Double the distance of Zone I, and draw a circle, using the same center
(GZ) used for Zone I. Label it Zone II.
                 (c) Nine Digits, Special Case, Expanded Angles. When 9 digits (7 in ADP
format) are reported in the EDM line, the angle reported is greater than 40°. The
prediction is plotted in the same manner as a normal case, except the left and right radial
lines are expanded equally from the preset 40° angle, to include all radioactive hazards.
Radial lines are expanded from GZ to the end of Zone II. (Example: If the expanded angle
is (***) 60 degrees or (*) 6, expand the radial lines 30 degrees on each side of the reference
line.)
           (6)    Time of Arrival.
                (a) Estimate the time of arrival of the fallout at a specific distance from
GZ by dividing the distance by the EWS. The formula looks like this:

                   Distance from GZ (km)
                                                 = Time of Arrival
                        EWS (kph)

                 (b) For operational purposes, the following rules of thumb may be applied
to the actual arrival of fallout:
                •     The actual arrival of fallout may occur as early as one-half of the
estimated time of arrival. That is, if the estimated time of arrival of the fallout is H+4
hours, the actual arrival may occur as early as H+2 hours.
                 •    If the actual arrival of fallout has not occurred at twice the estimated
arrival time (or 12 hours, whichever is earlier), it may be assumed that the area will not
receive fallout.
     f.     Ship Fallout Template. A fallout template, particularly designed for use on
ships, is shown in Figure G-17 and Figure G-18 (pages G-34 and G-35). The ship fallout
template is similar to the M5A2 fallout predictor (Figure G-14, page G-27) used by forces on
land. The main difference is that the semicircles upwind of GZ on the ship fallout template
do not refer to preselected weapon yield cloud radii.

            (1) Safety Distance. Determining the safety distance begins with determining
the fallout area at a specific time after detonation. Fallout will not occur simultaneously
within the predicted fallout area. It will commence in the vicinity of GZ and may be
expected to move down the fallout pattern (downwind direction) with an approximate speed
of the effective wind. The approximate zone in which deposition at the surface is taking
place at a specific time after the detonation may be determined by the use of the following
procedures:
                (a) Step 1. Multiply the effective downwind speed by the time (in hours)
after the detonation.
                (b) Step 2. Add the safety distance obtained from the template (for the
standard yield groups) to the distance found in Step 1 to allow for finite cloud size,
diffusion, and wind fluctuations.
                 (c) Step 3. On the plot (template), with GZ as center and the two
distances obtained from Step 2 as radii, draw two arcs across the fallout pattern. The zone
enclosed between these two arcs will, in most cases, contain the area of deposition at a
specific time after the detonation.

           (2) Fallout Plotting from the NAV EDM and Observations. Example: A ship
has received the NAV EDM. At 201332Z, a nuclear burst is observed from the ship, and
based upon the observations taken from the ship, the yield is estimated to be 70 KT and the
estimated GZ is 56°00’ N-12° 00’ E. A NAV NBC1 NUC report is transmitted as required,
and the ship will have to prepare a fallout prediction, using the simplified procedures:
                 (a) Step 1. As the yield is estimated only on the basis of observation, the
yield estimation may not be accurate. So, to be on the safe side, the greatest yield group in
which the estimated yield is contained should be used. Seventy KT is in yield group
DELTA, and the largest yield in this group is 100 KT. Therefore, 100 KT will be used for
the fallout prediction.
               (b) Step 2. Select the data contained in the DELTA yield group in the
NAV EDM: DELTA 122016, meaning that the effective downwind direction is 122° and the
effective downwind speed is 16 knots.
               (c) Step 3. On the template, draw the GN line from GZ through 122° on
the compass rose (see Figure G-19).
                (d) Step 4. From the nomogram in Figure G-16, page G-32, determine the
downwind distance of Zone 1 to be 30 nautical miles. The Zone II downwind distance is
double this distance, or 60 nautical miles from GZ, in effective downwind direction.
                  (e) Step 5. Using GZ as the center and the Zone I and Zone II distances
as radii (to the appropriate chart scale), draw two arcs between the radial lines. From the
template, read the cloud radius to be 3.7 nautical miles and draw a semicircle upwind of
GZ, using GZ as center and 3.7 nautical miles as radius. The preprinted semicircles may be
helpful. From the intersections of the Zone I arc with the radial lines, draw lines to connect
with the ends of the semicircle.
                  (f) Step 6. Determine the area where the deposit of fallout is estimated
to take place at a specific time after the detonation. Multiply the effective downwind speed
by the time (hours after detonation)—l.5 hours after the burst (H+1.5 hours): 16 knots
times 1.5 hours = 24 nautical miles. With GZ as the center and 24 nautical miles as the
radius, draw a dotted arc across the fallout plot. This arc represents the middle of the area
where the fallout may be expected to reach the surface at H+1.5 hours after the detonation.
To allow for finite cloud size, diffusion, and wind fluctuations, a certain distance ahead of
and behind this line must be added to determine the area where, in most circumstances,
the fallout will be deposited at the surface at H+1.5 hours. This is the safety distance.
From the table printed on the template, find the safety distance for yield group DELTA
(100 KT) to be 5 nautical miles. Add and subtract 5 nautical miles to and from 24 nautical
miles:
                  24 + 5 = 29 nautical miles, and 24 - 5 = 19 nautical miles
Draw two arcs across the fallout pattern, using the two distances as radii and GZ as the
center. The area confined by the two arcs and the crosswind boundaries of the fallout area
defines the approximate area of fallout deposit at 1.5 hours after the detonation. Complete
the fallout prediction plot by indicating the following on the fallout template: NAV EDM
used, yield, GZ, and geographic chart number (scaling).

       g.   Detailed Fallout Prediction.
          (1) Purpose. The purpose of the detailed fallout prediction is to provide the
subordinate units an immediate warning of the predicted contamination resulting from a
nuclear detonation. The commander will use the detailed fallout prediction in the tactical
decision-making process.
           (2) Procedures. The CBRN cell is responsible for preparing and plotting the
detailed fallout predictions. The fallout prediction work sheet provides the CBRN cell with
a standard work sheet for recording the nuclear burst (surface) information data.
Completing the fallout prediction work sheet is the first step in drawing the prediction. Use
the steps listed below to complete the work sheet.
                 (a) Step 1. Obtain a current wind vector plot. Before any bursts occur, the
wind vector plots are drawn. Refer to Appendix D for detailed information regarding wind
vector plotting (see Figure G-19, page G-37).
                (b) Step 2. Complete a detailed fallout prediction work sheet. Using an
NBC2 NUC report, determine the nuclear-burst information. Record this information on
the work sheet (see Figure G-20).
                 •    Lines ALFA, BRAVO, and ECHO are transcribed from the NBC2
NUC report.
                •    Lines CHARLIE and DELTA are used if the enemy burst or friendly
burst data is unknown. When enemy or friendly burst information is unknown, assume
that a worst case (100 percent fission yield [FY]) scenario has occurred and enter a 1 on line
CHARLIE. When the height of burst (HOB) is unknown, enter a 0 (zero) on line DELTA,
which represents a worst case HOB.
                 •     A friendly burst with known data information will come from the fire
support element (target analyst) delivering the weapon. The data will include the weapon
yield, FY/total yield (TY) ratio, HOB, GZ coordinates, DTG of the attack, and strike serial
number.
                  (c) Step 3. Determine the cloud parameters. Using the yield of the
weapon from line ECHO and the nomogram (Figure G-21, page G-40), locate the yield on
the right- or left-hand scale. Place a straightedge (hairline) on the yield, and align the
values on both scales. Read and record all cloud parameter values on lines FOXTROT
through JULIET of the fallout prediction work sheet.
NOTE: The following steps are exactly the same as the steps used in making an
EDM (refer to Appendix D for more information regarding EDMs).
                (d) Step 4. Determine the lateral limits of the prediction using the wind
vector plot. Mark the points representing the cloud top height and the two-thirds stem
height. Draw radial lines from the GZ point through these height points.
NOTE: If the wind vectors between the two-thirds stem height point and the
cloud top height point fall outside the radial lines drawn from GZ, expand the
angle formed by these two radial lines to include these outside wind vectors.

               (e) Step 5. Determine the effective wind speed (EWS). Mark the cloud
bottom height on the wind vector plot, and measure the length of the radial line (in km)
from GZ. Record this value on line KILO of the work sheet. Transfer the values from line
KILO and line JULIET to line LIMA. Compute the EWS using the following formula:
                EWS = Radial Line Distance From GZ to CB Height (KM)
                                Time of Fall From CB (HR)
Round this number to the nearest km. (Example: 21.5 = 22; 22.4 = 22.)
NOTE: If the EWS is less than 8 kph, it is a special case. When the wind speed is
less than 8 kph, always use an 8 kph wind speed in Step 6 below.
                 (f) Step 6. Determine the downwind distance of Zone I and Zone II.
Align a straightedge (hairline) from the yield on the right-hand scale (line ECHO of the
fallout prediction work sheet) to the EWS on the left-hand scale (line LIMA of the fallout
prediction work sheet) using Figure G-22, page G-42. Where the straightedge intersects the
center scale, read the downwind distance of Zone I. Record this on line MIKE of the fallout
prediction work sheet.
                  (g) Step 7. Obtain the FY/TY ratio from the nuclear target analyst. The
FY/TY ratio is expressed as a percentage. It states the percent of the weapon explosive
ability that is contributed by the fission process. The remainder of the weapon yield is
derived from fusion. This is significant in the fallout prediction. The fusion portion of the
weapon does not create residual contamination. Thus, a weapon with a FY/TY ratio of 0.6
means that 60 percent is fission and 40 percent is fusion. A crude comparison could be that
this weapon will make 40 percent less fallout than a weapon with the same size yield that
is 100 percent fission. If the FY/TY ratio is known, obtain the FY/TY adjustment factor
from the nomogram (Figure G-23, page G-43). The following describes how to use the
nomogram:
                 •    Lay a straightedge (hairline) from the TY on the left-hand scale to the
value of the FY/TY ratio on the right-hand scale. Where the straightedge intersects with
the center scale, read the FY/TY adjustment factor. Record the FY/TY ratio on line
NOVEMBER of the work sheet.
               •     Assume the yield to be 100 percent fission, and use an FY/TY
adjustment factor of 1 if the FY/TY ratio is unknown. Record the FY/TY adjustment factor
on line NOVEMBER of the work sheet.
                •     Obtain the HOB adjustment factor from the nomograms (see Figures
G-24 and G-25, pages G-44 and G-45) if the HOB is known. To use the nomogram, lay a
straightedge (hairline) from the yield on the left-hand scale to the value of the HOB on the
center scale. At the intersection of the straightedge with the right-hand scale, read the
HOB adjustment factor. Record the HOB adjustment factor on line NOVEMBER of the
work sheet.
             •    Assume a zero HOB, and use an HOB adjustment factor of 1 HOB if
HOB is unknown. Record HOB on line NOVEMBER of the work sheet.
                •   Obtain the adjusted downwind distance of Zone I. Multiply line MIKE
by line NOVEMBER; the result will be the adjusted downwind distance of Zone I and is
entered on line OSCAR of the work sheet.

        For an FY/TY ratio of 0.27, the FY/TY adjustment factor would be 0.7. Align the hairline from left to
        right, using the yield of 30 KT on the left-hand scale. Keeping the hairline in place on 50 KT, align the
        hairline with the FY/TY ratio of 0.27 on the right-hand scale. Read the FY/TY adjustment factor scale
        as 0.7.

         For an HOB of 60 m, the HOB adjustment factor would be 0.57. Align the hairline
         from left to right, using the yield of 50 KT on the left-hand scale. Keeping the
         hairline in place on 50 KT, align the hairline with the HOB of 60 m on the middle

NOTE: If the EWS is less than 8 kph, the detailed prediction is now complete.
Prepare the NBC3 NUC report (line ROMEO of the work sheet) as described in
Step 9. If the wind speed is greater than or equal to 8 kph, go to Step 8.
               (h) Step 8. Construct left and right radial lines. Measure the angle
formed by the radial lines drawn from GZ to the cloud top height and two-thirds stem
height.
NOTE: If the radial lines have been expanded to include vectors between the two-
thirds stem height and the cloud top height, this angle must be measured.
               •     If the angle formed is 40° or greater, measure the azimuths (in mils or
degrees from GZ) of the final left and right radial lines and record them on lines PAPA and
QUEBEC of the work sheet.
                 •    If the angle formed is less than 40°, bisect the angle (add azimuths
together and divide by 2) and expand the angle formed by the two radial lines to 40° (20° on
each side of the bisected azimuth). (See note in Figure G-19, page G-37).
              (i) Step 9. Prepare the NBC3 NUC report. Complete line ROMEO of the
work sheet. The report will always include the following line items:
                •    Line ALPHA: This line is the strike serial number. The strike serial
number is assigned by the CBRN cell at the operations center responsible for the area in
which the strike occurs.
               •     Line DELTA: (DDTTTTZMMMYYYY) This line is the DTG of the
burst, with DD (day), TTTT (H-hour) in local or ZULU time (state which), MMM (month),
and YYYY (year).
                •     Line FOXTROT: (yyzzzzzz) This line is the actual or estimated (state
which) coordinates of GZ. The letters “yy” represent the appropriate 100,000-meter grid
square, and the letters “zzzzzz” represent coordinates of the GZ within this grid square.
                 •    Line PAPAB: (sssxxxrr ddddcccc) This line is the prediction
dimensions and the azimuths of the two radial lines to the nearest mil or degree from GZ.
The letters “sss” represent the EWS to the nearest kph. The letters “xxx” represent the
downwind distance of Zone I to the nearest km. The letters “rr” represent the radius of the
stabilized cloud (GZ circle) to the next higher km if the value is not a whole number. The
letters “dddd” represent the azimuth of the left radial line, and the letters “cccc” represent
the azimuth of the right radial line (mils or degrees).
                      •    This line will contain only three digits (xxx) when the special
case of low winds (less than 8 kph) exists.
7.     NBC3 NUC Report
      The NBC3 NUC report is vital to effectively disseminating the estimated travel of
fallout across the battlespace.
      a.    General. The NBC3 NUC report reflects the predicted zones of contamination
for a nuclear surface burst. It is based on the NBC2 NUC report and a current wind vector
plot. Users of the NBC3 NUC reports are not limited to the use of the line items shown in
the example (see Figure G-26). Other line items may be added as appropriate.

          (1) Purpose. The purpose of the NBC3 NUC report is to report immediate
warning of the predicted contamination and hazard areas to higher, subordinate, and
adjacent units.
           (2) Message Precedence. All other messages, after the initial NBC1 NUC
report has been sent, should be given a precedence, which reflects the operational value of
the contents. Normally IMMEDIATE would be appropriate.

         (4) Step 4. From line PAPAB, determine the size of the cloud radius (rr).
Using GZ as the center, draw a circle with a radius equal to the stabilized cloud radius.
            (5) Step 5. Draw tangent lines from the outer edge of the cloud radius to the
points of intersection of the radial lines with the Zone I arc.
          (6)     Step 6. From line PAPAB, determine the EWS (sss).
                (a) Beginning at GZ, draw as many dashed time-of-arrival arcs between
the radial and tangent lines as will fit inside the prediction within Zones I and II.
                (b) Label the dashed arcs as hours after the burst: H+1, H+2, and so on.
H+1 is the closest arc to GZ.
              (c) If a time-of-arrival arc coincides with a Zone I or II arc, extend the
zone boundary with a dashed line.
          (7) Step 7. Add marginal information to the plot. This should be all of the
known information about the attack (see Figure G-28).
          (8)     Step 8. Orient the prediction to the map, and evaluate the hazard (see
Figure G-27).
NOTE: If the NBC3 NUC report (line PAPAB) only contains Zone I (xxx), follow
the steps below (see Figure G-28):
           (9) Step 1. Identify the map scale to be used. Obtain a sheet of overlay paper
or other transparent material. Mark a GZ. A GN line is not necessary.
           (10) Step 2. The three digits shown on line ZULU is the radius of a circle for
Zone I. Using the GZ as the center, draw a circle with a radius equal to the Zone I distance.
Label this area Zone I. Draw a second circle at twice this radius for Zone II. Label this
area Zone II.
          (11) Step 3. Add marginal information to the plot. This should be all known
information about the attack.
          (12) Step 4. Orient the prediction to the map and evaluate the hazard.

       c. 	   Contamination Prediction System for Merchant Ships at Sea.
              (1) 	 Significance of CBRN Warnings.
                (a) Radioactive fallout from nuclear explosions on sea and land targets,
particularly from the latter, may affect large areas of adjacent waters.
                 (b) The areas affected will depend on the prevailing wind conditions, and
any ship close to or approaching these areas will be in grave danger. It is therefore
essential that the ships should be warned of the fallout hazards and contamination in order
that the following may occur:
               •    Passive-defense measures, such as switching on the wash-down
systems, may be taken.
                    •	   Course may be altered to avoid the danger zones, if necessary.
              (2)   MERWARN
                     	      System to Ships at Sea.
                (a) A simplified contamination warning system has been established
throughout NATO for broadcasting, via MERCOMMS and coastal radio stations, warnings
of a contamination that is dangerous to merchant shipping. This system calls for the
origination by NATO naval authorities.
                 (b) A MERWARN NBC3 NUC report will be issued after a nuclear attack
producing fallout. It gives fallout data for a specific explosion or a series of explosions,
which will be identified in the report. NBC3 NUC reports are issued as soon as possible
after the attack and at 6-hour intervals (to the nearest hour) thereafter for as long as the
fallout danger exists. They contain information that enables the ship to plot the danger
area.
               (c) The standard format of a MERWARN NBC3 NUC report contains
lines ALFA, DELTA, FOXTROT, and PAPAB of the military NBC3 NUC report (see
Appendix D for additional MERWARN information).
                    (d) 	 The MERWARN NBC3 NUC report has the following structure:
                    •	   MERWARN NBC3 NUC report.
                         ALFA            Strike serial number (as defined by the naval
                                         authority)
                         DELTA           DTG of detonation
                         FOXTROT         Location of attack (LAT and LONG or geographical
                                         place name)
                         PAPAB           EWS (3 digits and unit of measurement), downwind
                                         distance of Zone I (3 digits and unit of measurement),
                                         cloud radius (2 digits and unit of measurement), left
                                         and right radial lines of the predicted fallout hazard
                                         area (3 digits and unit of measurement each)
                         Example:

                •    MERWARN NBC3 NUC Report, Plain Language Format: The
MERWARN NBC3 standard format may not be suitable after a multiple nuclear attack
which produces fallout from several bursts in a large or complex target area. In such cases,
warnings will be plain language statements of a more general nature, indicating the area
affected and the expected movement of the fallout.
                     Example:
                                   MERWARN NBC3 NUC Report
                                   ALFA/UK/02-001/N//
                                   DELTA/021405ZSEP1999//
                                   Fallout extends from Glasgow area to eastern Ireland at
                                   021405Z and is spreading westwards at 12 knots. Irish
                                   Sea is likely to be affected within an area of 60 nautical
                                   miles of the British coast.
               (e) MERWARN Diversion Order. In addition to the origination of
MERWARN NBC3 NUC messages, naval authorities may, if circumstances dictate,
broadcast general diversion orders based on the fallout threat, merchant ships proceeding
independently will be passed evasive routing instructions of a more general nature, using
the standard naval shipping identifier MERWARN diversion order.
                  Example:
                             MERWARN Diversion Order
                             English Channel closed. All shipping in North Sea remain
                             north of 052 degrees N until 031500ZSEP1999.
           (3) Precedence of NBC Messages. All MERWARN NBC messages should be
given the precedence FLASH (Z) to ensure the rapid handling on any military circuit
between the originating authority and the MERCOMMS and/or coastal radio stations. This
precedence should not be used where the rules for the use of the international safety signal
(“TTT” for chemical warfare [CW] and “security” for voice circuits) apply.
NOTE: Adjacent MERWARN originators are responsible for relaying information
to coast earth stations/coast radio stations under their control as necessary.
           (4) Danger Zones. All shipping in waters out to 200 nautical miles from any
coast at the outset of war must be regarded as an area of possible fallout danger from
nuclear attacks on shore.
           (5) Plotting MEWARN NBC3 NUC Report. Plot this report in the same
manner as “Fallout Plotting from NAV EDM and Observations” (paragraph 6f[2]), using the
ship fallout template (see Figure G-29, page G-52).

     d.    Time of Completion of Fallout.
            (1) Most contaminated particles in a radioactive cloud rise to considerable
heights. Therefore, fallout may occur over a large area. It may also last for an extended
period of time. A survey conducted before the fallout is complete would be inaccurate
because contaminants would still be suspended in the air. For this reason (and the hazard
to surveying personnel), nuclear surveys are not conducted before completion of fallout.
           (2) An estimate of the time of completion (Tcomp) of fallout for a particular
location may be determined using a mathematical equation. The time (in hours) after a
burst when the fallout will be completed at any specific point is approximately 1.25 times
the time of fallout arrival (in hours after burst). Add the time (in hours) required for the
nuclear cloud to pass over. This is expressed by using the following formula:


                                                      (2 x cloud radius)
                    Tcomp = (1.25 x Tarrival) +
                                                             EWS
Example: For a given location, the following data has been determined:
           •    Time of detonation = H.
           •   Time of arrival = H+2 hours (time of arrival is determined by dividing the
distance from GZ to the given point by the EWS).
         •     Cloud diameter = 4 km (2 x cloud radius) (cloud diameter/radius [rr] is
determined from Figure G-20, page G-39, or from line item PAPAB of the NBC3 NUC
report).
           •    EWS = 20 kph (EWS [sss] is determined from Figure G-19, page G-38, or
from line item PAPAB of the NBC3 NUC report).
                                                              4 km
                                   Tcomp = (1.25 x 2 hr) +
                                                             20 kph
                              Tcomp = 2.5 hr + 0.2 hr
                              Tcomp = 2.7 hr
       Therefore, fallout for the given location is expected to be complete by H+2.7 hours.

NOTE: To convert 2.7 hours into clock time, multiply 0.7 by 60. The product in
this example is 42. Therefore, Tcomp is 2 hours and 42 minutes.
            (3) The actual completion of fallout can be determined if a peak NBC4 NUC
report is received from the AOI. For detailed information regarding nuclear reconnaissance,
monitoring, and survey, refer to Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for
Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance.
8.   NBC4 NUC Report
     The NBC4 NUC report is a key tool used by units to define the type and extent of the
contamination.
     a.    Locating and Reporting Nuclear Contamination.
         (1) Fallout predictions provide a means of defining possible areas of a nuclear
contamination. Militarily significant fallout is expected to occur only within the predicted
area. However, the prediction does not indicate exactly where the fallout will occur or what


30 April 2009   FM 3-11.3/MCWP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56, C1               G-53
the dose rate will be at a specific location. Rainout or washout can also increase nuclear
contamination on the ground, creating local hot spots. Areas of neutron-induced radiation
can also be caused by low air bursts.
           (2) Before planning operations in a nuclear environment, commanders must be
aware of these residual contamination hazards. The information required for such planning
is derived from the equations and nomograms given in the following sections and in
Appendixes J and K. The basic information needed is contained in NBC4 NUC reports.
They provide information on the actual measured contamination in the form of dose rates.
     b.    Message Precedence. All other messages, after the initial NBC1 NUC report has
been sent, should be given a precedence, which reflects the operational value of the
contents. Normally, IMMEDIATE would be appropriate (see Figure G-30 for a sample
NBC4 NUC report).

         (1) The location is sent as UTM or LAT/LONG grid coordinates; the level of
contamination reading is expressed in cGy/h.
          (2) Lines QUEBEC, ROMEO, and SIERRA may be repeated as many times as
necessary to give a specific picture of the contamination throughout an area. A zero dose
rate may also be reported on line ROMEO, and it is an extremely valuable piece of
information in determining the extent and duration of the contamination.




G-54              FM 3-11.3/MCWP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56, C1                       30 April 2009
           (3) Only outside unshielded dose (OD) rates are reported by the unit, and the
DTG is reported in Zulu time. Certain abbreviations are associated with the dose rate to
describe the circumstances surrounding the contamination. Note that the definition of line
ROMEO includes information on the dose rate trend and the relative or actual radiation
decay rate. The dose rate must be reported, while the latter two items are optional. They
require evaluation, which may be done above unit level. A monitor cannot provide this
information.
      c.   Shielding. Shielding reduces the effects of gamma radiation on personnel and
equipment. The denser the material is, the better the shield. Low-density materials are as
effective as higher-density materials when the total thickness of the low-density material is
increased. It is not possible for gamma radiation to be completely absorbed. However, if
enough material is placed between the individual and the radiation source, the dose rate
can be reduced to negligible proportions.
           (1)    Shielding Principles.
                  (a)   Density. Density is defined as the number of molecules or mass per
unit of volume.
                (b) Half-Thickness. This is the amount of material required to reduce the
dose rate by one-half. See Table G-2 for selected half-thicknesses.
                           Table G-2. Half-Thicknesses (X ½) of Materials

                                   Material      Half-Thickness (Inches)

                           Wood                            8.8

                  (c)   Total Thickness. This is the actual thickness of the shielding material.
                  (d)   Position of the Shield. The closer the shield is to the source, the better.
               (e) Dose Rate Buildup. The dose rate buildup is produced by the shield.
The shield causes radiation to scatter; therefore, the closer to the shield, the higher the dose
rate.
           (2)    Shielding Materials.
              (a) Earth. Earth is the most common shielding material. About 1 foot of
earth makes an adequate shield.
                  (b)   Concrete. About 6 to 8 inches of concrete makes a good shield.
                  (c)   Steel. Tanks and amtracks are very good shields against radiation.
                  (d)   Buildings. Wood or brick buildings make good shields.
           (3) Effectiveness. The effectiveness of a given material in decreasing radiation
intensity is measured in units of half-value layer thickness (half-thickness). This unit is




30 April 2009     FM 3-11.3/MCWP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56, C1                 G-55
defined as the thickness of any material which reduces the dose rate of gamma radiation to
one-half its unshielded value.
NOTE: If personnel are surrounded by a 6-inch concrete wall (half-thickness) and
the gamma radiation outside is 200 cGy/h, they would receive gamma radiation at
the rate of 100 cGy/h. The addition of another 6 inches reduces the rate to 50
cGy/h. Each succeeding half-thickness of concrete would reduce the radiation.
       d.   Measuring Nuclear Data.
          (1) Measurements of nuclear data must be taken in accordance with the unit
SOP. Measurements can be taken directly from an unshielded position if dose rates are low
enough or from a shielded position, such as a shelter or vehicle.
           (2) When the indirect technique is used, most of the readings are taken inside
the vehicle or shelter. However, at least one outside reading is necessary to determine the
TF, which relates the readings inside to the unshielded values outside. The latter readings
are to be reported since they are necessary for further calculations pertaining to troops in
the open or other vehicles or shelters.
            (3) To determine the TF, both the inside and outside readings must be taken
after fallout is complete. Calculate the TF using the following formula:
                                               inside shielded dose (ID) rate
                                      TF =	
                                                          OD rate
NOTE: The TF is always less than 1. It can be determined from the measurement
of the dose.
           (4) The readings taken inside the vehicle or shelter represent the ID. These
readings must be converted to OD before reporting. Readings are converted using the
following formula:
                                         OD = ID / TF
           (5) A precalculated list of TFs is contained in national manuals, an example of
which is shown in Table G-3. This information is not used by unit CBRN defense personnel
when calculating or reporting OD rates. Its principal use is to establish the relative
shielding ability of one shelter, structure, or vehicle as compared to another. It is also used
for instructional and practice purposes.
           (6) These factors are for the most exposed, occupied location. They are not
based on dose rates from fallout; they are based on gamma radiation from cobalt-60. Since
cobalt-60 radiation is almost twice as strong as the radiation from fallout, the actual TF
should be much lower (more protection).
          (7) In some cases the term CF is used. It is always the reciprocal of the TF. The
formula to convert a TF to a CF is:

                                              1         OD
                                      CF =         =
                                              TF        ID

       e.    Surveys.
           (1) Air-Ground Correlation Factors (AGCFs). An AGCF is required for
calculating surface dose rates from aerial dose rates taken in an aircraft during a survey.
The AGCF relates a ground dose rate reading to a reading taken at approximately the same
time in an aircraft at survey height over the same point on the surface.
             (2) 	 The AGCF is calculated as shown below: 

                                                    ground dose rate

                           AGCF =
                                                     aerial dose rate
Example: 	        surface dose rate      =       20 cGy/h
                  aerial dose rate        =       5 cGy/h
                  (200 feet survey height)
                                                       20 cGy/h
                                          AGCF =
                                                       5 cGy/h 

                  AGCF = 4           

         (3) By multiplying the readings taken in the aircraft at a survey height by the
AGCF, the surface level reading can be approximated. These values are to be reported in
the NBC4 NUC report. The formula to determine ground dose rate is:
                             Ground dose rate = Air dose rate x AGCF
     f.   Reporting Instructions. Monitoring data to be sent to other units/HQ is
transmitted as an NBC4 NUC report.
          (1) Automatic Reports. According to the SOPs, units in the contaminated area
submit certain monitoring reports automatically. These provide the minimum essential
information for warning, hazard evaluation, and survey planning. Reports are sent
through specified channels to reach the CBRN cell. The automatic reports are the initial,
peak, and special reports specified by the CBRN cell or required by commanders for
operational purposes.
           (2) Initial Report. After noting a dose rate of 1 or more cGy/h outside,
defensive measures according to the SOPs are implemented and the unit formats an NBC4
NUC report (Figure G-31) containing the code "INIT" (for initial) in line ROMEO. The first
report is used at the CBRN cell to confirm the fallout prediction. The dose rate cannot be
converted to H+1 at this time.

           (3) Peak Report. After the initial contamination is detected, the unit monitor
continuously records dose rates according to the time intervals specified in unit SOP. The
dose rate rises until it reaches a peak, and then it decreases. In some cases, the dose rate

may fluctuate for a short time before beginning a constant decrease. When the
measurement continues to decrease, the monitor takes an inside reading and then an
outside reading for the TF calculation. First, the inside reading is recorded. Within 3
minutes, the monitor goes to the outside location. After all information is recorded, the
CBRN defense team calculates the TF and applies it to the highest dose rate. It then
formats the NBC4 NUC report. The word "PEAK" is used in line ROMEO.
           (4) Special Reports. Other standing instructions may establish the
requirement for special NBC4 NUC reports. The CBRN cell evaluates these special reports
and invites command attention to areas or conditions of serious concern. The operational
situation, unit radiation status, and similar considerations determine the criteria for
special reports, which cannot be specified here. Generally, this report may be required
when the surface dose rate goes above a specified value. When the dose rate increases after
showing continuous decrease, a special report must be sent. Special reports may be
required after a specified period of time if the unit remains in the area.
           (5) Directed Reports. Selected units in the contaminated area will be directed
to submit additional NBC4 NUC reports. The CBRN cell uses these reports to evaluate a
nuclear-contamination hazard, the decay rate of fallout, and how long the decay rate (and
the contamination overlay) will remain valid. They are used to determine the H-hour (if
unknown) and the soil type in neutron-induced areas. Reliable calculations are directly
related to the precision of the dose rate measurement. Tactical decisions and personnel
safety depend on the accuracy of these measurements. The assessment of further
development of the contamination situation depends on this data. An error in dose rate
measurements means a similar error in all following calculations.
           (6) Series Reports. A series report consists of a series of dose rate readings
taken at the same location at time intervals specified in the unit SOP after the peak dose
rate has been recorded. The location must remain constant. The report contains each
reading and the time it was taken. The report contains the word “series” in line GENTEXT.
           (7) Summary Reports. The summary report shows the radiation distribution
throughout the unit AOR. The locations for the readings are selected by the unit according
to the distribution of its elements and the extent or variety of the area terrain. The time
each reading was taken is reported. The word “summary” is given in line GENTEXT.
            (8) Verification Reports. The verification report is a unit response to a direct
request. If data are lacking from a specific location near or in the unit area, the CBRN cell
may request a verification report. It may also be requested to confirm abnormal readings
reported earlier. A verification report is not a retransmission of the earlier report, but a
check of the actual conditions of the area. The unit tasked with the submission of a
verification report receives specific instructions as to the location from which a reading is
desired. The word “verify” is used in line GENTEXT to indicate a verification report.
          (9)     Trends. Dose rate trends are—
                  (a)   INIT—initial reading
                  (b)   PEAK—peak reading
                  (c)   DECR—decreasing since last reading
                  (d)   INCR—increasing since last reading

9.     Evaluation of Nuclear Information
     After the NBC4 NUC reports are available, they must be evaluated with regard to the
actual hazard encountered by the troops. The aim is to predict the expected dose rates and
accumulated dosages for possible missions within the contaminated area. Theoretically,
once a nuclear hazard has been identified, the contamination existing at any future time
can be calculated using simple decay relationships and other calculations. The following
calculations are shown below:
       •    Calculation of H hour.
       •    Decay of fallout.
       •    Decay rate (n).
       •    Validity time for decay rate (Tp).
       •    Normalization factor (NF).
       •    Overall correction factor (OCF).
     a.    Calculation of H hour or Time of Burst (TOB). Calculate H hour mathematically,
using the following procedures:
       •	   Step 1. Set up the formula as follows: 

                      T1 = Time after H hour at which reading Ra was made. 

                      Ta = Time peak reading was measured. 

                      Tb = Time last reading was measured. 

                      Tb - Ta = interval between readings Ra and Rb. 

                      Ra = Peak reading.             

                      Rb = Last reading.         

                      n = Decay rate.        

                                              Tb – Ta
                                      T1 =
                                             (Ra/Rb)1/n-1
       •    Step 2. Place known values in the formula.
       •    Step 3. Divide 4.75 by 3.06 and T1 = 1.55.
     b.   Fallout Determination of Decay. The dose rate at any location in a fallout area
does not remain constant. It decreases with time according to the Kaufmann equation,
which describes the decay of fallout after it has completely settled to the ground. Where—


                      R2 = Dose rate at the location at the time of reading. 

                      R1 = Dose rate (normalized to H+1) at the location. 

                      t1 = H+1. 

                      t2 = Time, in hours, after H hour that R2 was measured.



G-60              FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56            2 February 2006
                       n = Decay rate.
      •    The dose rate and total dose calculations cannot be performed until the decay
rate is known. The true decay rate will not be known immediately. Accurate
determination must wait until several sets of NBC4 NUC reports are available.
      •    The decay rate of fallout depends on many factors. These factors include the
following:
                     —Height and type of burst.
                     —Type of weapon (fission, fission-fusion, or fission-fusion-fission).
                     —Type of active materials, construction, and structural materials
within the weapon.
                     —Type and quantity of materials vaporized or sucked up into the
fireball.
                     —“Salting” the weapon to produce a slow decay.
                     —When fallout overlaps fallout. 

                     —Soil type. 

     •    The decay rate varies with time. Generally, the decay rate becomes slower as
time passes.
     •     The same decay rate may not be present across the entire fallout area. The
pattern, as a whole, will have an average value, which may vary from position to position.
The amount of variation in the decay rate for fallout is expected to range from 0.2 to 2.0.
The lower values are assumed for “salted” weapons.
    •     Decay calculations are valid only if the dose rate readings are made after the
completion of fallout. While fallout is still arriving, the Kaufmann equation is not valid.
      •    Because of the delay in determining the actual decay rate, an assumed decay
rate of n = 1.2, referred to as standard decay, is used by all units until informed otherwise
by the CBRN cell. When the actual decay rate has been established by the CBRN cell, it
will be sent as line ROMEO on the NBC4 or NBC5 NUC report. The assumed normal
decay rate of n = 1.2 is used in many simplified nuclear calculation procedures. The
optimum time of exit calculations are also based on n = 1.2.
NOTE: In the equations of the following sections, all times are given in hours
after the burst. The information given in corresponding line items of the CBRN
messages (e.g., SIERRA) must be converted appropriately when moving from
calculation to reporting or vice versa.
      c.    Determination of Decay Rate.
            (1)   7:10 Rule. For every seven-fold increase in time, radiation will decay by a
factor of 10.
          (2) Standard Decay (n = 1.2). When no decay rate is given or there is no way to
determine a decay rate, the standard decay rate of 1.2 will be used by the control center in
their computations.

            (3) Nonstandard Decay (n does not equal 1.2). Anything other than 1.2 is
considered nonstandard. Decay rates greater than 1.2 decay faster than standard. Decay
rates less than 1.2 decay slower than standard.
          (4) Decay Constant (Rate, Exponent) (n). The decay rate (n) is a changing
factor we must adjust to throughout CBRN operations. It changes as short-lived fission
products die off, with the rate slowing down as time goes on. The decay rate may not be the
same from pattern to pattern or from one location to another within the same pattern.
There are two methods of determining the decay rate—pocket calculator and graphical.
The following steps utilize the calculator method. The Kaufmann equation is the preferred
method of determining the decay rate. A scientific calculator is required.
                (a) Step 1. From the report, determine the Ra, Rb, Ta, and Tb.
       Where—
                      Ra = Peak dose rate (cGy/h) measured.
                      Rb = Last measured dose rate (cGy/h) available on the report.
                      Ta = Time in hours (after H hour) that Ra was measured.
                      Tb = Time in hours (after H hour) that Rb was measured.
                (b) Step 2. Set up the formula as follows:

                                               log(Ra/Rb)
                                         n=
                                               log(Tb/TA)

                (c)   Step 3. Place known values in the formula.
NOTE: Information was provided from the nuclear data sheet.

                log(Ra/Rb)          log(52/17)         log(3.059)       0.486
           n=                   =                  =                =            = 1
                log(Tb/Ta)          log(9/3)           log(3.000)       0.477

                (d) Step 4. Solve for n. The decay rate is rounded to the nearest single
decimal place (tenth).
     d.    Period of Validity for the Decay Rate (n). The period of validity is a
mathematical calculation that determines how long the decay rate is valid due to the
various aspects discussed earlier regarding the decay of fallout. The period of validity is
calculated as follows:
          (1) 	 Step 1. From the series report, determine the Ta and Tb. Where—
                      Tp     Period of validity decay rate (n).
                      3      Constant.
                      Ta     Time in hours (after H hour) that Ra was measured.
                      Tb     Time in hours (after H hour) that Rb was measured.
          (2)   Step 2. Set up the formula as follows:


G-62             FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56            2 February 2006
                                         Tp = 3(Tb - Ta) + Tb

          (3)      Step 3. Place known values in the formula.
          (4) 	 Step 4. Solve for Tp. 

                                      TOB = 090400Z       

                                      Tp = +    24 

                                               092800 = 100400Z (DTG)
          Example: Given TOB = 010100ZJUN2004, Ta = 9, and Tb = 3.
NOTE: Information was provided from the nuclear data sheet.
                   Tp = 3 (Tb-Ta) + Tb 

                   Tp = 3 (9-3) + 9 

                   Tp = 3 (6) + 9 

                   Tp = 18 + 9 = 27 hours 

      Tp + TOB = 27 hours + 010100ZJUN2004 = 020400ZJUN2004
           (5) Step 5. Add the Tp value to the TOB. This will give the DTG of when n is
no longer valid.
     e.   Normalizing Factor (NF).
           (1) Once the decay rate (n) is determined, the nuclear reading may be
normalized to H+1 readings. This normalized reading is commonly referred to as the R1
reading. Simply stated, it is mathematically determining what the dose rate reading was
at any given location 1 hour after the burst.
          (2) Survey teams and monitors take readings at various times after the burst.
These readings may be 15 minutes or 10 hours after the burst. Any reading that is not
recorded 1 hour after a burst (H+1) is commonly referred to as an Rt reading. To perform
nuclear calculations and make decisions on the nuclear battlefield, all readings must be
represented using the same time reference.
          (3)      To determine the NF, use the following steps:
                    (a)    Step 1. From the NBC4 NUC report or nuclear data sheets,
determine the decay rate, dose rate reading, and time measured of the reading you desire to
be normalized to H+1. When normalizing readings from ground survey reports, you must
use midtime for your computations. Midtime is simply the middle time between the
beginning and end of the ground survey. For example, if a survey starts at 1030 and ends
at 1100, the midtime for calculating the NF is 1045.
                        (b) 	   Step 2. Set up the formula as follows:
                                      R1 = NF x R2
                                      NF = (T2)n




2 February 2006	        FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56          G-63
                     R1        = 	 Normalized dose rate reading at H+1.

                     R2        = 	 Dose rate reading at any other time.

                     NF        =     N
                                     	 ormalization factor.

                     T2        = 	 Time reading taken, in hours, after the burst.

                     n         =     Decay
                                      	    rate.

                         (c)       Step 3. Solve for NF.
Example: A peak dose rate of 100 cGy/h was measured at H+2 in a fallout area where the 

decay rate is 1.2. Normalize the dose rate to a reference time of H+1. 

Solution: 

       Calculate 	NF = (T2)n

                 NF = 21.2 = 2.30 (2.297 rounded to the nearest hundredth)

       Calculate 	R1 = NF x R2

                 R1 = 2.30 x 100 cGy/h = 230 cGy/h (normalized dose rate reading at
                 H+1)

    f.   Outside Correlation Factor (OCF). When calculating survey data, combining the
NF and CF reduces the number of required calculations. This additional step is called the
OCF. To compute the OCF, use the following steps:
       •	     The OCF formula is— 

                   Aircraft: NF x AGCF = OCF 

                   Vehicle: NF x VCF = OCF 

       •      The OCF is rounded to the nearest hundredth.
     •    The OCF is used instead of the NF. The OCF will convert shielded readings to
unshielded readings normalized to H+1. Multiply the OCF by the dose rate reading. This
unshielded H+1 reading (R1) is always rounded to the nearest whole number and written in
the “Do Not Use” column of the nuclear data sheet.
10. NBC5 NUC Report
    The NBC5 NUC report (Figure G-32) is a vital part of ensuring that the COP is
maintained. It provides information vital to the commander.
     a.    Purpose. The NBC5 NUC report is used to pass along information on areas of
actual contamination. This report can include areas of possible contamination, but only if
actual contamination coordinates are included in the report.

     b.    Message Precedence. All other messages, after the initial NBC1 NUC report has
been sent, should be given a precedence, which reflects the operational value of the
contents. Normally, IMMEDIATE would be appropriate.

     c.     Plotting Data and Producing an NBC5 NUC Report.
          (1) Contaminated areas are shown on the nuclear contamination situation
map, and information about them must be passed to other units and HQ. The most
expeditious means for this is the nuclear contamination overlay.
            (2)   The preparation of such an overlay is described below:
                 (a) After all available information from monitoring and surveying has
been plotted on a map as normalized (H+1, unshielded ground dose rates [R1]), contour
lines for the standard dose rates can be drawn on a nuclear contamination overlay.
                 (b) When constructing the nuclear contamination overlay, there are
factors that locally affect the contamination pattern.
                 (c) This is particularly true between points in an aerial survey. These
include topographic features, such as bluffs or cuts, heavily built-up or wooded areas, and
bodies of water. For example, a large river will carry away any fallout landing in it, leaving
its path relatively free of contamination. Also, the contamination hazard near a lake will be
lower than expected. The fallout particles will sink to the bottom of the lake, and the water


2 February 2006         FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                          G-65
will provide shielding. In wooded or built-up areas, a measure of the reduction of dose rate
can be obtained by using the TFs (see Table G-3, page G-57) for these areas.
                 (d) Dose rate contour lines showing the contamination hazard in an area
can be drawn as follows: Count the number of readings taken for the route or leg. Since the
aircraft flew at a constant ground speed, taking readings at equal time intervals, the
distance covered between any two consecutive readings will be the same. If the route or leg
is divided into a number of equal-length segments, the total number of segments will equal
the number of time intervals. Each division point on the route or leg will represent a
location over which a dose rate reading was taken. The interval between readings equals
the length of the course leg or route divided by the number of readings, minus one. For
example, if seven readings are taken, the route is divided into only six segments—one less
than the number of readings taken by the survey party. The formula is:

                                         Route or Course Leg Distance (km)
               Interval Distance =
                                              (Number of Readings - 1)

                •     Determine the H+1 dose rate contour lines to be plotted (e.g., 20 [30
for NATO], 100, 300, 1,000 cGy/hr). These contour lines may be required for NBC5 report
purposes or for anticipated calculations to be made from the data.
                  1,000 cGy/h = Plotted in red.
                   300 cGy/h = Plotted in green.
                   100 cGy/h = Plotted in blue.
                   20 cGy/h = Plotted in black. (NATO forces use a 30 cGy/h line.)
               •     Determine the points on the chosen survey routes or on course legs
and close to monitoring locations that are providing the desired dose rates.
                •    Connect all the points having the same dose rates with a smooth line.
Use all plotted monitoring data as additional guides in constructing these contours.
                •     Use care and judgment in plotting these contours and visualize the
probable general shape and direction of the pattern. Any dose rates disproportionately
higher than other readings in the immediate area indicate possible hot spots. When such
readings are reported, that area should be rechecked. If dose rates are confirmed, these hot
spots should be plotted and clearly identified. Figure G-33 shows a typical plot that might
be developed from survey data.

addressee to replot the data from the NBC5 NUC report and connect them to produce dose

rate contours, which is a time-consuming process. Staff planners must consider that the
shapes of dose rate contours drawn to correspond with a relatively brief series of readings
and coordinates can vary significantly.
          (2) If electronic communications of the data or communications of the hard
copy are not available and if time and distance permit, nuclear contamination overlays are
sent by messenger. Data is transmitted manually by the NBC5 NUC report as a last
resort.
          (3) When the contamination comes from a single burst, the dose rates will be
normalized to H+ 1. But if there have been several detonations at different times and no
single H+ 1 is possible, the dose rates are reported for a specific time.
           (4) On the NBC5 NUC report, a closed contour line on a plot is represented by
repeating the first coordinate.
          (5) To calculate the dose rates along the contour lines at a later time, use the
procedures described in paragraph 10e below and label the contour lines accordingly.
     e.   Determining the Dose Rate for an Arbitrary Time. The Kaufmann equation can
be used as follows:
              R1 x T1n = R2 x T2n can be mathematically changed to represent the missing
              (or objective) variable to read: R2 = R1 / (t2)n or R2 = R1 / NF.
          (1) 	 In this equation— 

                  R2 = Dose rate at the location at the arbitrary time. 

                  R1 = Dose rate (normalized to H+1) at the location. 

                  t1 = H+1. 

                  t2 = Arbitrary time, in hours, after H hour. 

                  n    = Decay rate. 

                  NF = Normalization factor. 

NOTE: If R1 is the normalized dose rate reading at H+1, then t1 will always be 1.
Therefore the equation can be set up as follows:
Dose rate reading at H+1 is 600 cGy/h. Determine the dose at H+12. The decay
rate is 1.0.
                      R1 = 600 cGph; t1 = 1 hr; t2 = 12 hr; n = 1
                  (a) 	 Step 1. Set up the formula. 

                         R2 = R1 / (t2)n or    R2 = R1 / NF

                  (b) 	 Step 2. Work the problem.
                         R2 = 600 / (12)1.0     or    R2 = 600 / 12
                         R2 = 600 / (12)       or     R2 = 50 cGy/h
                         R2 = 50 cGy/h
           (2) The NF graphs found in Appendix J can be utilized to determine the NF for
a given time if using the R2 = R1 / NF formula only if less than H+12 hours after the burst.

                (a) Step 1. Determine the time (in hours and minutes) after the burst
that the reading was taken (12 hours).
               (b) Step 2. Enter the appropriate figure in Appendix J with the time after

down and 1.0 across (decay rate down is 12.000).
                (c) Step 3. Divide the dose rate reading by the NF. The product is the
arbitrary time dose rate reading (600 / 12 = 50 cGy/h).

determine the dose rate at an arbitrary time.

equation can also be used as follows:
               R1 x T1n = R2 x T2n can be mathematically changed to represent the missing
               (or objective) variable to read: t2 = R1 x t1 / R2.
           (1) 	 In this equation— 

                   R2 = Dose rate at the location at the arbitrary time. 

                   R1 = Dose rate (normalized to H+1) at the location. 

                   t1 = H+1. 

                   t2 = Arbitrary time, in hours, after H hour. 

NOTE: If R1 is the normalized dose rate reading at H+1, then t1 will always be 1.
Therefore, the equation can be set up as: t2 = R1 / R2.
Example: The dose rate reading at H+1 is 1,000 cGy/h. The decay rate is 1.0. Determine
the time at which R2 will be 500cGy/h.
                     R1 = 1,000 cGy/h; R2 = 500 cGy/h

hand R1 column. Lay the hairline across to the far left-hand Rt column (Rt is the same as
R2) with 500 cGy/h.
              (d) Step 4. Hold the hairline straight and steady, and read the value in
the Time column. This answer should be approximately 2 hours.
      g.   Total Dose Reduction. The primary objective of the commander is to accomplish
the mission while keeping the total dose as low as possible. The total dose may be reduced
in several ways.

            (1) Avoid the area. When the actual measured fallout area cannot be avoided,
select the route that has the lowest dose rate. Commit the fewest number of personnel
possible to the operation.
         (2) Reduce exposure time. Plan operations to minimize the time spent in
contaminated areas. Select the route that is fastest and easiest to cross.
          (3)     Delay the time of entry. If possible, allow the contamination to decay.
           (4) Use shielding. All vehicles should have increased shielding. Cross fallout
areas on foot as a last resort.
      h.   Total Dose Procedures. The dose rate of radiation does not directly determine
whether or not personnel become casualties. Casualties depend on the total dose received.
If dose rates were constant, the total dose would simply be the product of the dose rate and
the time spent in the contaminated area (just as in a road movement problem, rate x time =
distance). However, the dose rate continually diminishes because of the decay. This makes
the calculation more complicated. The actual dose received is always less than the product
of the dose rate at the time of the entry times the duration of stay. The total dose, time of
entry, and time of stay calculations in the fallout areas are solved in the total dose
nomograms.
           (1) Using the total dose nomograms in Appendix J, relate the total dose, H+1
dose rate, stay time Ts, and entry time Te. The index scale is a pivoting line. It is used as
an intermediate step between D and R1 and Ts and Te. The index scale value can be used to
multiply R1 to find D. The four values on these nomograms are defined below:
            D = Total dose in cGy. 

            R1 = Dose rate, in cGy/h, one hour after the burst (H+1). 

            Ts = Stay time, in hours. 

            Te = Entry time (hours after H hour). 

            n     = Decay rate. 

NOTE: The H+1 dose rate must always be used. Never use a dose rate taken at
any other time.
       R1 must be known before the total dose nomograms can be used. If any two
       of the other three values are known, the nomograms can be used to find the
       missing piece of information. D and R1 or Ts and Te are used together.
            (2) When working with total dose nomograms, start the problem on the side of
the nomogram where the two known values are located. If D and R1 are given, start on the
left side. If Ts and Te are given, start on the right side. Never begin a problem by joining D
or R1 with either of the time values. Place a hairline on either side with D and R1 or Ts and
Te. Align the hairline with the Index line; while holding the hairline in place with the Index
value. Enter the nomogram with the remaining side, D and R1, or Ts and Te to determine
the missing value.

            (3)        Example: Given         R1        =        200 cGy/h
                                              Te        =        H+1.5 hours
                                              Ts        =        1 hour
                                              n         =        1.2
                      Find                    D         =        ?
            D                         R1                     Ts                       Te                n
             ?                   200 cGy/h                   1 hr                    1.5 hr            1.2
            Solution: 90 cGy.
Select the n = 1.2 total dose nomogram. Connect H+1.5 hours on the Te scale with the Ts
reading of 1 hour. Pivot the hairline at its point of intersection with the index scale to the
200 cGy/h on the R1 scale. Read D = 90 cGy on the total dose scale. See Figure G-36 for an
example.
            (4) By 25 hours after the burst, the change in the rate of decay is so low that it
is relatively insignificant. Therefore, a different approach is used to estimate the total dose
when Te is greater than 25 hours. In this case, simply multiply the dose rate at the time of
entry by the time of stay. This is written “NOTE: This formula can be modified to
determine Te or Ts as well.”
       D = RTe x Ts can be mathematically changed to represent the missing (or objective)
              variable to read:
                                                R1
                                          RTe =
                                                (Te)n
                  D         = Total dose (cGy). 

                  RTe = Dose rate (cGy/h) at time of entry. 

                  Ts        = Time of stay (h). 

                  Example: Given— 

                                     R1 = 300 cGy/h
                                     Ts = 2 hours
                                     Te = H+30 hours

       i.   Crossing a Fallout Area.
           (1) In nuclear operations, it is to be expected that extensive areas will be
residually radioactive. It may be necessary to cross an area where there is residual
radiation.
            (2) When crossing a contaminated area, the dose rate will increase as the
center of the area is approached and will decrease as the far side is approached. Therefore,
determine an average dose rate for total dose calculations. A reasonable approximation of
the average dose rate can be determined using only one-half of the highest dose rate. This
is written:

                                                  Rmax
                                         Ravg =
                                                    2

            Ravg = average dose rate
            Rmax = highest dose rate encountered or expected to be encountered
         (3) This calculation is sufficient when looking for a suitable route for crossing a
contaminated area or when time is critical.
            (4) The effective dose rate for a crossing problem can be treated like the dose
rate for a fixed point. Therefore, all follow-on calculations (e.g., accumulated dose, earliest
time of entry) for the crossing problem can be done using the same procedures used for a
fixed point described earlier. The TF must also be applied as in a stationary situation.
       j.   Optimum Time of Exit from Fallout Areas.
          (1) Nuclear fallout may present a serious hazard to units that remain in the
contaminated area. Shelters (such as, field emplacements) are the best protective measures
against nuclear radiation for troops in the field. If the shelter provides any appreciable
amount of protection, it will be advantageous to remain and improve it rather than to
evacuate to an uncontaminated area. If the situation permits and higher HQ approves, the
commander may decide to move out of the contaminated area. By evacuating at the
optimum exit time, the radiation dose to personnel is kept to a minimum.
          (2) To compute the optimum exit time from a fallout area, the time of the
detonation, location of an uncontaminated area, average TF, and time required to evacuate
must be known.
          (3) When moving from an area contaminated by fallout, the unit moves into an
uncontaminated location. This will necessitate waiting until fallout is complete at the
present positions.
           (4) The average TF of the fallout shelters and the vehicles used to leave the
contaminated area must be computed. Since all shelters are not the same, an average
value should be used. The TF of a vehicle may be estimated. A unit moving on foot will be
fully exposed and will have a TF of 1.0.
          (5) The time to load vehicles and move out of the contaminated area must be
estimated. In order to minimize exposure time, it may be necessary to temporarily abandon
nonessential items and recover them at a later time when the dose rate has decreased to an
acceptable value. The optimum time of exit (Topt) is calculated as—

           Topt = MF x Tev
           MF is a multiplication factor taken from Figure G-37, page G-78.
           Tev is the time required to evacuate the contaminated area.
The following abbreviations are used in the optimum time of exit calculations:
           TFS is the average TF for the fallout shelters.
         TFM is the average TF after leaving shelters (during movement out of the
contaminated area).
           TFRatio is the TF ratio.
           (6)    Compute the optimum exit time by the following steps:
                  (a)   Step 1. Calculate the TF ratio (TFRatio = TFS/TFM).
                 (b) Step 2. Determine the multiplication factor (MF). Enter the vertical
axis of Figure G-37, page G-78, with the value obtained for TFRatio. Move horizontally along
this value to the curve. Move straight down, and read the MF from the horizontal axis.
                (c) Step 3. Calculate the optimum exit time. Multiply MF by Tev. The
product is the optimum time, in hours, after detonation that the unit should leave its
shelters and evacuate the area.
           (7)    Special Considerations.
                  (a) The unit should evacuate the fallout area as soon as possible when the
ratios of TFRatio are close to or greater than 0.5.
                 (b) If the optimum time of exit is estimated to be before the actual arrival
of fallout, the unit should evacuate the area as soon as possible after the fallout is complete
and an uncontaminated area is available.
                (c) The unit will receive the smallest dose possible if it leaves the
contaminated area at the optimum time of exit. If the commander is willing to accept up to
a 10 percent increase in dose, he may leave the shelters any time between one-half and
twice the optimum time of exit.
                 (d) If possible, personnel should improve their shelters while waiting for
the optimum time of exit. The estimate of the optimum time of exit should be recalculated
if significant improvement is made in the shelters. Improved shelters mean the unit should
remain in shelters for a longer period of time to minimize the dose to the personnel.

     k.   Neutron-Induced Radiation Areas.
           (1) Type of Burst. Neutrons are produced in all nuclear-weapon bursts. Some
of these neutrons may be captured by various elements in the soil under the burst. As a
result, these elements become radioactive, emitting beta particles and gamma radiation for
an extended period of time. Beta particles are a negligible hazard unless the radioactive
material makes direct contact with the skin for an extended period of time. Beta particles
can cause skin irritations, varying from reddening to open sores. In contrast, gamma
radiation readily penetrates the body and can cause radiation injury and even death. To
determine the external military hazard posed by induced radiation, an analysis of the dose
rate of the emitted gamma radiation must be determined.
            (2) Location Data. The location of a suspected, induced radiation area created
by an air burst is determined by nuclear-burst data. Weather conditions have no influence
on its location or size. Surface winds will not affect the pattern. The pattern, if produced,
will always be around GZ. The size of the pattern depends on the yield of the weapon and
the HOB. Table G-4 shows the boundaries of the induced area for different yields.
Assuming an optimum HOB, the user enters the table with the yield of the weapon. The
distance given is the maximum horizontal radius to which a 2-cGy/h dose rate will extend 1
hour after the burst.

                 (a) Enter the Keller nomogram (Figure G-38 or G-39, pages G-80 and
G-81) with the yield of the weapon to extract the horizontal radius, in meters. The distance
given is the maximum horizontal radius to which a 2-cGy/h dose rate will extend 1 hour
after the burst.
                 (b) Enter the radii of the neutron-induced contamination (see Table G-4)
with the yield of the weapon to extract the horizontal radius, in meters. The distance given
is the maximum horizontal radius to which a 2-cGy/h dose rate will extend 1 hour after the
burst.
                   (c)   The following steps should be utilized when plotting neutron-induced
radiation areas:
                   •     Step 1. Obtain a clean sheet of overlay paper.
                •    Step 2. Obtain the nuclear-burst information from the NBC2 NUC
report or from the CBRN cell strike serial log. Record the strike serial number, DTG of
burst, GZ location, weapon yield, and map scale on the overlay.
               •     Step 3. Utilize the Keller nomogram or the radii of induced-
contamination table to determine the horizontal radius of the 2-cGy/h line.
                   •     Step 4. Select the GZ coordinate.

                •     Step 5. Draw a circle around the GZ that matches the distance
extracted in Step 3 (see Figure G-37, page G-78).
               (d) The circular area with a radius as given in Figure G-40, page G-82,
around GZ is regarded as contaminated until actual dose rate readings indicate otherwise.
The actual area of contamination is usually substantially less, depending on the actual
yield and the HOB.

           (3)   Decay of Induced Radiation.
                 (a) The soil in the target area is radioactive to a depth of 0.5 meter at GZ.
In contrast, fallout is a deposit of radioactive dust on the surface. From this, it can be seen
that decontamination of the area is impractical.
                 (b) The decay characteristics of induced radiation are considerably
different from those of the fallout. Fallout is a mixture of many substances, all with
different rates of decay. Induced radiation is produced primarily in aluminium,
manganese, and sodium.
                (c) Other elements, such as silicon, emit so little gamma radiation or
decay so fast that they are less important.
                   (d) During the first 30 minutes after a burst, the principal contributor to
induced radiation is radioactive aluminium. Almost all soils contain aluminium. It is one
of the most abundant elements in the earth’s surface. Radioactive aluminium has a
half-life of 2 to 3 seconds. Because of this, almost all the radioactive aluminium has
decayed within 30 minutes after the burst.
                (e) Most soils also contain significant quantities of manganese. This
element decays with a half-life of about 2.6 hours. From 30 minutes after a burst until 10
to 20 hours after the burst, manganese and sodium are the principal contributors to the
radiation. After 10 to 20 hours after the burst, sodium (which decays with a half-life of
about 15 hours) is the principal source of radiatio.
                 (f) Soil composition is the most important factor in the decay of induced
radiation. Its decay must be considered differently from that of fallout. For fallout, the
decay rate is calculated by using the Kaufmann equation. For induced radiation, the
percentage (by weight) of elements present in the soil determines the decay rate.
                (g) Since soil composition varies widely, even in a localized area, the
actual chemical composition of the soil must be known to determine the rate of decay of the
induced radiation. The soils are divided into four types (see Table G-5).
                (h) Since the actual soil composition will not be known, soil Type II (the
slowest decay) is used for all calculations until the CBRN cell advises the use of a different
soil type.

                (i) Soil type is determined by using engineer soil maps or an NBC4 NUC
report and the induced-decay nomograms in Appendix J. The method is basically a process
of elimination. The dose rate and the time it was measured are applied to an induced-decay
nomogram. This will result in an H+1 or R1 dose rate. Compare the rates and times with
the nomograms until the results have the same R1.
          (4) TFs. TFs for induced areas are determined in the field. The TF in Table
G-6 should be used with the greatest reservation. Actual TF in induced areas may be lower
by as much as 70 percent because of the technical characteristics of radiation.

                (a) Essentially, the strength of gamma radiation is measured in MeV.
Fallout less than 24 hours old has an average energy of 0.67 MeV. Induced radiation
emitted from the three principal soil elements has a range of 0.68 to 1.2 MeV.
                (b) Because of the unique decay characteristics of induced radiation, the
TF must be recalculated frequently (every 4 hours is recommended). This accounts for the
changes in the penetration ability of the remaining radiation.

           (5) Dose Rate Calculations. The decrease in the dose rate must be calculated
before the total dose can be found. This is done with the decay nomograms. Use the
residual radiation (induced) decay nomograms in Appendix J for these calculations. They
allow the user to predict the dose rate at any time after the burst.
                   (a)   The Rt scale shows H+1 dose rates.
                   (b)   The Rt scale shows the dose rate at other times. This scale shows dose
rates at x t.
           (6) Total Dose Calculations. The nomograms in Appendix J are used for
predicting the total dose received in an induced area. This nomogram relates total dose,
H+1 dose rate, stay time, and entry time. The two scales to the left of the index line show
the total dose and H+1 dose rate. There are two stay-time scales to the right of the index
line. The extreme right scale shows entry time. The index line is a pivoting line, which is
used as an intermediate step between D and R1. R1 is found by using one of the induced-
decay nomograms.
             (a) If the soil type is unknown, assume that the soil is Type II. The total
dose nomogram (Appendix J) is never used to find R1.
                (b) The “stay time” Ts must also be calculated. If the soil type is known,
the appropriate scale under “stay time” will be used. It is possible to find any one value on
the total dose nomogram if the other three are given. The formula for time of stay is
calculated as—
                Example 1: Given—
                 R1 = 140 cGy/h
                Te = H + 6 hours
                Ts = 1 hour

                Soil Type: II 

                Find D 

                Answer: 72 cGy 

             Solution: On the nomogram (Appendix J) connect H+6 on the Te scale with 1
hour on the Ts scale (soil Types II and IV) with a hairline. Pin the hairline at the point of
intersection with the index scale. Now, pivot the hairline to 140 cGy/h on the R1 scale.
Read 72 cGy on the D scale.
                Example 2: Given— 

                 R1 = 300 cGy/h 

                 Te = H+6 hours 

                 D = 70 cGy 

                 Soil Type: III 

                 Find Ts

                 Answer: 1 hour

            Solution: On the nomogram (Appendix J) connect 70 cGy on the D scale with
300 cGy/h on the R1 scale. Pin the hairline at the point of intersection with the index scale.
Pivot the hairline to H+6 hours on the Te scale. Read 1 hour on the Ts scale (soil Types I
and III).
           (7) Crossing an Induced Radiation Area. If an area must be crossed, the lowest
dose rate area consistent with the mission is selected.
                (a) When calculating the total dose, it is necessary to determine an
average dose rate. Dose rates increase as the center of the area is approached and then
decrease beyond the center of the area. The average dose rate represents the mean value
that an individual is exposed to during the time of stay. A reasonable approximation of the
average dose rate can be obtained by dividing the maximum dose rate predicted to be
encountered by two. This is written as—
                                                  Rmax
                                         Ravg =
                                                    2
               (b) The time of stay (TS) must be calculated (see Figure G-41, page G-86).
The formula for time of stay is calculated as—
                                               Distance
                                        TS =
                                                Speed
                  •   Step 1. Identify the time of entry (Te).
                  •   Step 2. Calculate Ravg (this will be the R1 value for the nomogram).
                  •   Step 3. Calculate TS.
                •    Step 4. Use the appropriate nomogram (see Figure G-41, page G-86).
Line the Te and TS (based on soil type) up.
                  •   Step 5. Pivot the hairline to the R1 value.
                  •   Step 6. Convert OD to ID to determine the total dose.

 Connect 10 hours on the Te scale with 0.1 hour on the Ts scale (soil
 Types II and IV). Pin the hairline on the index scale. Pivot the hairline
 150 cGyph on the R1 scale. Read the OD as 6 cGy. Calculate the ID:
 ID = OD x TF ID = 6 cGyph x 0.22 ID = 1.32 cGyph or
 1 cGyph. NOTE: Hairline may not be to scale.

           (8) Determination of Decay Rate for Induced Radiation. Decay characteristics
of an induced radiation are considerably different from those of a fallout. The Kaufmann
equation may not be applied.
                (a) The decay of induced radiation depends on the elements in which it is
induced. Soil contains many different elements with varying half-lives, so the decay rate
changes in time and must be monitored constantly.
               (b) The decay rate (n) at a fixed location can only be determined from
consecutive measurements, using the following equation:

                                            1                      Ra

                                            t
                                                      X 1n
                                                             (   Ra + t
                                                                          )
                (c) Ra is the dose rate reading in cGy/h at an arbitrary time and (Ra + t)
is a second reading taken at the same location after t hours.
                 (d) Manganese and sodium are two elements with relatively long half-
lives that are frequently found in soils. Therefore, they are expected to be the principal
sources of radiation after a burst. For sodium, with its half-life of 15 hours, the decay rate is
0.046. For manganese, with its half-life of 2.6 hours, the decay rate is 0.27.
           (9) Determination of Dose Rate for Arbitrary Time. The dose rate (R1+t), in
cGy/h, at an arbitrary time (t hours) after a reading is calculated as—
                R1 + t = Ra(-n x t)
Ra is the dose rate at the time (t) of the reading, n is the decay rate at that time, and EXP ()
is the exponential function (inverse or INV; the argument is the power to which
e=2.71828…is raised).
           (10) Determination of Dose Accumulated in Neutron-Induced Area. The dose D,
in cGy, accumulated between entry to and exit from a neutron-induced gamma activity
(NIGA) area is found by using the formula—
                D = R1/n((-n x tin ) - (-n x tout))
R1 is the dose rate in cGy/h at the reference time, n is the decay rate at that time, tin and tout
are the time of entry and exit from the NIGA area, in hours, after the reference time.
           (11) Determination of Earliest Time of Entry. To ensure that a limiting dose
(DL) is not accumulated during a stay in an NIGA area, the earliest time of entry (tin) can
be determined as follows:
                Te = -1/n * (DL/(R * n * (1 -(-n * Ts)).
                  TS = Time of stay in the area in hours
                  R = Dose rate at the reference time H+1
                  n = Decay rate at that time
        (12) Determination of Time of Exit from Neutron-Induced Area Given a
Maximum Dosage. If a certain limit DL for the dose accumulated during a stay in an NIGA

area is given, the time (tout) to leave the area can be determined from the following
equation:
                Tout = -1/n*n((-n*Te)-(n*DL)/R1)
Te = Time of entry, in hours, after the reference time at which the dose rate was R1 and the
decay rate was D.
11. NBC6 NUC Report
     The NBC6 NUC report (Figure G-42) provides commanders and staff with detailed
information that is vital to the operation.
     a.    Purpose. The NBC6 NUC report is used to provide detailed information on a
nuclear attack. The NBC6 NUC report is submitted to higher HQ. It is written in narrative
form with as much detail as possible.
     b.    Message Precedence. All other messages, after the initial NBC1 NUC report has
been sent, should be given a precedence, which reflects the operational value of the
contents. Normally, IMMEDIATE would be appropriate.

                                           Appendix H


 RELEASE-OTHER-THAN-ATTACK CONTAMINATION AVOIDANCE
        TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES

1.   Background
     The ROTA contamination avoidance TTP provides vital SA to the commander when
faced with a ROTA incident.
     a.    General. This appendix covers the procedures to warn and report CBRN
releases other than the traditional military CBRN attacks resulting from the offensive use
of CBRN weapons. These releases may include, but are not limited to, CBRN or TIM
releases due to damaged or destroyed storage bunkers, transport vehicles, storage or
production facilities, ammunition supply sites, power plants, etc.
     b.    Characteristics.
          (1) Types of HAZMAT. Most nations in the world have some form of hazardous
CB (or radiological) production or storage facilities. Most of these materials are used for
peaceful purposes and are considered to be in one of the following categories:
                  (a)   Agricultural. These include insecticides, herbicides, fertilizers, etc.
                 (b) Industrial. These are chemicals or other substances (biological or
radiological) used in manufacturing processes or for cleaning.
                (c) Production and Research. These are CBRN materials used in
research or produced in a facility.
           (2) Detection. Civilian chemical materials or compounds or biological
materials may not be detectable by the standard CB detection devices of tactical units.
Also, these materials may not be detectable with the human senses and may cause
symptoms that are different than symptoms from CBRN agents.
           (3)    Definitions.
                  (a)   Release Area. This is the predicted area immediately affected by the
release.
                (b) Hazard Area. This is the predicted area in which unprotected
personnel may be affected by CBRN material spreading downwind from the release area.
The downwind distance depends on the type of the release, the weather and terrain in the
release area, and the area downwind of the release area.
                  (c) Contaminated Area. This is the area in which CBRN material may, in
solid or liquid form, remain at hazardous levels for some time after the release. The actual
shape and duration can only be determined by surveys.
                 (d) Elevated Releases. Any release which, due to fire, momentum, or
explosion, is carried more than 50 m above the ground is considered an elevated release.




2 February 2006    FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                   H-1
                  (e) TIM. TIM is the generic term for toxic (CB) or radioactive substances
in a solid, liquid, aerosolised, or gaseous form. These may be used (or stored for use) for
industrial, commercial, medical, military, or domestic purposes. TIM may be chemical,
biological, or radioactive and may be described as toxic industrial chemical (TIC), toxic
industrial biological (TIB), or toxic industrial radiological (TIR).
2.    Release-Other-Than-Attack Contamination Avoidance Procedures
     Avoidance procedures are broken down into three actions—before, during, and after
the attack. The lists given, while not all-encompassing, may assist in developing the unit
SOP and directives.
      a.   Preattack.
           (1)   Alert subordinate units.
          (2) Assess the ability of the MOPP gear to protect against agent or material;
request additional protective gear as required.
           (3) Specify (commanders) the appropriate MOPP levels; establish automatic
masking criteria; and, if MOPP0 is assumed, determine the location for the chemical
protective clothing based on the METT-TC.
         (4) Continue the mission while ensuring that the following actions are
implemented to minimize casualties and damage:
               (a)      Protect personnel, equipment, munitions, POL, food, and water from
the contamination.
                 (b)    Place the detection paper to provide visibility and maximum exposure
to liquid agents.
               (c) Practice OPSEC, dispersal, and cover and concealment so that the
unit may avoid being targeted.
                 (d)    Check to ensure that the chemical detectors and alarms are prepared
for use.
                 (e)    Prepare the updated CDMs for each unit.
           (5)   Determine the decontamination requirements.
      b.   During Attack.
         (1) All personnel automatically mask, sound the alarm, decontaminate
themselves (as required), assume MOPP4, and administer self-aid and buddy-aid.
          (2) The chain of command and communications are restored and the unit
continues the mission.
           (3)   Adjacent units are immediately warned of the potential downwind vapor
hazards.
          (4) The unit identifies the type of agent and submits an NBC1 ROTA report as
the mission permits.
         (5) The unit performs the following actions for attacks that leave liquid or solid
contamination on the equipment, personnel, or terrain:



H-2    FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56        2 February 2006
                  (a)   Conduct personal wipe-down and operator’s spray-/wipe-down.
             (b) Warn medical evacuation personnel of the contamination casualties.
Wrap and mark the persons killed in action.
                  (c)   Mark the contaminated area, and relocate to a clean area if the
mission allows.
                (d) Determine where and when further decontamination can be
accomplished, if necessary.
              (e)       Coordinate for decontamination, and resupply protective clothing and
decontaminants.
              (f) Ensure that the contaminated battle dress overgarments are
exchanged within 24 hours after being contaminated.
                  (g)   Replace the contaminated protective covers within 24 hours.
                (h) Conduct unmasking procedures, treat casualties, prepare for
evacuation (as the mission permits), and ensure the operational status of the service
detection systems.
              (i) Receive the NBC2 ROTA report, plot the potential hazard area, and
inform the commander.
     c.   Postattack.
          (1) The unit has undergone decontamination operations, and casualties have
been evacuated.
         (2) The unit reorders CBRN defense equipment (i.e., MOPP suits, filters,
decontamination kits).
           (3) If the unit has not yet identified what agent was used, continue the effort to
identify the agent and source. This will be done by using the following:
          •       M8 chemical-agent detection paper.
          •       M256A1 chemical-agent detection kit.
          •       ICAM or Chemical-Agent Monitor Block II (CAM II [USMC]).
          •       Automatic Chemical-Agent Detector Alarm (ACADA).
          •       AN/VDR-2 radiac set.
          •       AN/PDR-56 radiac set.
          •       AN/PDR-77 radiac set.
          •       ADM-300 radiac set.
          •       DOD biological sampling kit.
          •       HAZMAT identification system.
          •       Hazardous category, chemical identification system.
          •       Samples that are forwarded to the area lab for analysis.

          (4) If the unit must continue to operate in or occupy the contaminated area, the
unit should do the following:
          •   Continue efforts to refine the contamination hazard area and extent by
continued sampling and detection.
           •    Adjust or improve the MOPP as required.
           •    Mark the contaminated areas and identify the “hot spots.”
         •    Monitor the contamination decay or covering to determine when natural
decay may render the area safe.
           •      Be alert for transient contamination and the spreading or movement of
contamination by natural sources (i.e., wind, rain, runoff, rivers) or by human sources (i.e.,
vehicle traffic, rotor wash).
3.    Release-Other-Than-Attack Information Management
      Managing ROTA information is crucial for the success of a command. To be useful,
the ROTA information must be collected, reported, and evaluated. Once evaluated, it can
be used as battlefield intelligence. Obtaining and converting ROTA information into usable
intelligence does not just happen. The volume of information that needs to be collected and
reported could easily disrupt communications and tactical operations if not properly
managed.
      a.   Collecting ROTA Information. The first step in managing ROTA information is
to determine what information is available and who is available to collect it. Observer data
provides information that a ROTA event (intentionally or accidentally) has occurred.
Monitoring, survey, and reconnaissance data provide information on where the hazard is
located. Every unit is responsible for observing and recording ROTA events, but only
selected units automatically submit NBC1 ROTA reports to the CBRN cell.
      b.   Consolidating ROTA Data.
            (1) NBC1 ROTA reports allow the CBRN cell to collect information on where
the designated observers have seen a nuclear attack. The CBRN cell then evaluates this
information in the form of an NBC2 ROTA report. From the NBC2 ROTA report, a
simplified or detailed hazard prediction is made. This prediction (NBC3 ROTA report) is
only an estimate of the hazard area. Feedback is needed from the units to determine
exactly where the contamination is located. This feedback comes from monitoring, survey,
and reconnaissance data (NBC4 ROTA reports). Monitoring and reconnaissance operations
give the initial location of CBRN hazards to the CBRN cell. Initial monitoring and
reconnaissance reports are generally forwarded through intelligence channels to the CBRN
cell. This information may also be sent to the CBRN cell by the use of various DSTs, as
discussed in Chapter III.
           (2) The CBRN cell then plots the information on the situation map. If more
information is required, the CBRN cell directs a unit (picked because of its location and
capability) to collect and forward the necessary data. This information could be from
additional monitoring reports or a survey of the area in question. Collecting ROTA
information is a joint effort of units and the CBRN cell. The unit does the actual collecting
of information. The CBRN cell plans for and directs the collection effort. More detailed




H-4    FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56         2 February 2006
information concerning this collection effort is addressed in Multiservice Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance.
       c.   Evaluating ROTA Information. After the ROTA information has been collected,
it is evaluated. It is then used as battlefield intelligence. The CBRN cell is the primary
evaluation center. The units and intermediate HQ use this raw data to develop ROTA
intelligence for their own use until detailed results are available from the CBRN cell.
     d.   Transmitting ROTA Information. The procedures used to transmit ROTA
information to and from the CBRN cell are an important part of the IM. The method of
transmitting information depends on the tactical situation and mission of the unit. Refer to
Chapter III for more detailed information.
4.   NBC1 ROTA Report
      The NBC1 ROTA report (Figure H-1, page H-6) is the most widely used report. The
observing unit uses this report to provide ROTA data. All units must be completely familiar
with the NBC1 ROTA report format and its information. The unit must prepare this report
quickly and accurately and send it to the next higher HQ. Battalion (squadron) or the
service equivalent and higher elements decide which NBC1 ROTA reports to forward to the
next higher HQ. If several reports are received for the same ROTA event, a consolidated
NBC1 ROTA report is forwarded. This reduces the number of reports to a manageable level.
     a.    Purpose. The purpose of the NBC1 ROTA report is to provide ROTA data.
     b.   Precedence. The first time a ROTA event occurs, the designated unit will send
the NBC1 ROTA report with a FLASH precedence. If a previous NBC1 ROTA report has
been forwarded, an IMMEDIATE precedence will be used.
     c.    Information Included. The report will include lines BRAVO, CHARLIE, GOLF,
INDIA, and TANGO and may include line items ALFA, FOXTROT, MIKER, YANKEE,
ZULU, and GENTEXT with the information as currently described for CBRN reports. Line
CHARLIE provides the same information as line DELTA, except it indicates an observed
ROTA event rather than an observed attack. Line GOLF will include the type of delivery if
applicable, the ROTA type of container (e.g., bunker, waste, reactor, transport, stockpile),
and the size of the release (small, large, or extra large) if appropriate. Line INDIA will
indicate the observed release height and indicate the type of release as ROTA nuclear
power plant, TIM, or the agent name or identification number. Line INDIA will indicate the
material persistency. Additional descriptive entries for a ROTA event can be entered into
line MIKER. Line TANGO will indicate a description of the terrain/topography and the
vegetation. Lines YANKEE and ZULU may indicate locally observed weather. Line
GENTEXT will provide the specific chemical compound or the type of biological agent if
available.
     d.   Preparation. Determine the line items for this report by using the same
procedures as the previous contamination avoidance TTP appendixes per the type of attack
or event.

     The NBC2 ROTA report reflects the evaluated ROTA data. It is based on one or more
NBC1 ROTA reports. Users of the NBC2 ROTA reports are not limited to the use of the line
items shown in Figure H-2. Other line items may be added as appropriate.
     a.   Purpose. The purpose of the NBC2 ROTA report is to pass the evaluated data to
higher, subordinate, and adjacent units.
     b.   Precedence. All messages, after the initial NBC1 ROTA report has been sent,
should be given a precedence, which reflects the operational value of the contents.
Normally, IMMEDIATE would be appropriate.
     c.   Preparation. The division (or designated higher HQ) CBRN cell prepares the
NBC2 ROTA report, assigns a strike serial number, and disseminates the report to the
appropriate unit.
     d.     Subsequent Data. Subsequent data may be received after the NBC2 ROTA
report is sent. Use the same strike serial number and DTG of the attack or incident.
Determine the line items for this report using the same procedures as the previous
contamination avoidance TTP appendixes per the type of attack or event.

6.      NBC3 ROTA Report
     The NBC3 ROTA report reflects the predicted areas of contamination. It is based on
the NBC2 ROTA report and any current relative data. Users of the NBC3 ROTA reports
are not limited to the use of the line items shown in Figure H-3, page H-8. Other line items
may be added as appropriate.
     a.   Purpose. The purpose of the NBC3 ROTA report is to report the immediate
warning of the predicted contamination and hazard areas to higher, subordinate, and
adjacent units.
     b.   Precedence. All messages after the initial NBC1 ROTA report has been sent
should be given a precedence, which reflects the operational value of the contents.
Normally, IMMEDIATE would be appropriate.
      c.  Preparation. The report will use the information as described in this manual for
lines ALFA, CHARLIE, FOXTROT, GOLF, INDIA, MIKER, OSCAR, PAPAA, PAPAX,
TANGO, XRAYB, YANKEE, ZULU, and GENTEXT. The hazard area location is described
in line PAPAX, with the defining release area radius and protective action distance
summarized in line PAPAA. Determine the line items for this report using the same
procedures as the previous contamination avoidance TTP appendixes per the type of attack
or event.

      d.   Types of Releases. There may be chemical, biological, and/or radiological
material present in any AO, which will present a hazard to persons if it is released into the
atmosphere. Releases may be accidental or intentional. The amount of material released
may be small or extremely large. Such ROTA events can be divided into two types based on
their origin:
           (1) Type N, ROTA Nuclear. Nuclear material can be released into the
atmosphere from the core of a nuclear reactor, has been damaged or which has gone out of
control. Similar incidents may occur at nuclear-fuel reprocessing or production facilities.
Such a release can result in very high levels of radiation, covering distances of hundreds of
km.




H-8               FM 3-11.3/MCWP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56, C1                        30 April 2009
           (2) Type T, TIM. There are five cases of incidents under Type T. These cases
include items that may be used or stored for use for industrial, commercial, medical,
military, or domestic purposes. TIM may be TIC, TIB, or TIR.
                 (a) Case 1, Nuclear-Waste or Radiological-Material Storage. Damage to a
nuclear-waste or radiological-material storage facility may result in the release of
radiological material into the atmosphere. Such a release will result in LLR covering a
fairly short distance, which will be dangerous to anyone remaining in the hazard area for
an extended period of time.
                (b) Case 2, RDD. The intentional release of large amounts of radiological
material can result in hazardous areas extending far downwind.
                 (c) Case 3, Biological Bunker or Production Facility. Damage to a storage
bunker containing biological agents intended for use in BW or to production facilities for
such agents containing active agent containers will result in smaller release areas and
lower quantities than if agents had been dispersed from a weapon. However, due to the
toxicity of such agents and the likelihood of having an elevated plume, dispersed material
may travel downwind at hazardous levels for many hours.
                (d) Case 4, Chemical Stockpile or TIM Transport/Storage. Damage to
stockpiled munitions containing chemical agents will result in considerably smaller
quantities of agent released than the intentional use of munitions; therefore, the downwind
hazard area will usually be smaller than for a chemical attack. Damage to containers of
TIM being transported by road, rail, or boat can result in large quantities released into the
atmosphere. However, the toxicity and stability of these materials will be less than for
chemical agents and the hazard areas will also be smaller than for a chemical attack. This
category also includes small storage quantities and single munitions found leaking on the
battlefield.
                  (e) Case 5, Bulk Chemical Storage. TIC are stored in very large quantities
(greater than 1,500 kg) in large tanks, often under pressure and at low temperatures. A
catastrophic rupture of such a tank will result in a highly toxic cloud, which usually
exhibits dense-gas behavior. This type of release may also occur intentionally by a terrorist
or other deliberate action. Such a cloud will not travel with the wind until after its
concentration has been reduced considerably, often when it is below toxic levels. In addition
to their toxicity, TIC are often corrosive, flammable, explosive, or able to react violently
with air or water. These hazards may be greater than the immediate toxic effects.
     e.    Procedures and Constraints.
           (1)   Procedures.
                 (a)   Record and update the following information:
                •    Weather information from relevant CBRN commanders, which may
contain forecast data and measured data.
              •    Weather information from local measurements and observations,
which may contain data before and during the cloud passage period.
                 •     A database of local meteorology measured during the cloud passage
period.

               (b) Record the terrain features (wooded areas, mountains, plains, etc.),
which may influence the direction and speed of the ROTA clouds.
                 (c) Generate an NBC3 ROTA report, and consider distribution whenever
the threat of a ROTA event is high.
                (d) Estimate the MET parameters for the release area and downwind of
the release area upon the receipt of an NBC1 or NBC2 ROTA report.
                (e) Select (according to the national directives) the weather information to
be used, and calculate the predicted downwind hazard area.
          (2)   Constraints.
               (a) When calculating the predicted downwind hazard area from ROTA
events, many factors will affect the accuracy of the prediction. Some of these factors include
the following:
                •     Type and amount of CBRN agents or materials.
                •     Type and amount of delivery or storage systems.
                •     Type and amount of agent containers.
                •     Terrain composition.
                •     Weather.
                •     Air stability.
                •     Type of surface.
                •     Vegetation.
                •     Surface air temperature.
                •     Relative humidity.
                (b) Some of the above factors are not considered when using the
procedures in this appendix or annotated to refer to a previous appendix for appropriate
hazard prediction procedures unless evaluated and estimated manually by the user.
               (c) The procedures shown in this appendix or annotated to refer to a
previous appendix for appropriate hazard prediction procedures are based on the limited
amount of information available at the time of the ROTA event.
                 (d) To be able to make more accurate predictions, more information about
the listed factors has to be available and more sophisticated methods have to be used for
prediction.

ROTA types and cases is shown in Figure H-4, page H-12.

       g.     Hazard Prediction Methods.
           (1) Type N, Releases of Nuclear Fuel from a Nuclear Reactor. Material
released from a nuclear-reactor incident will be mostly, or all, particles of nuclear fuel.
Since the decay of the particles from a nuclear-reactor accident is different than for
nuclear-weapon fallout, the procedures used for the hazard prediction after nuclear
detonations cannot be used.
                 (a) The release may be violent enough to send the nuclear-fuel particles
into the upper atmosphere. The hazard area prediction procedures described in Appendix F
should be used, assuming a Type P attack. If the release takes more than 5 minutes, the
latest arrival time may need to be adjusted for the duration of the release.
                 (b) Hazard areas for extended duration releases should be recalculated as
a Type R attack. The end points of the line are the release location and the current position
of the front end of the cloud. Use 1.5 times the mean wind speed. For wind speeds of 10 kph
or less, Type P must be used.
                (c) If the release is reported as continuous and the reported duration
exceeds 2 hours or is not reported, the procedures for Type S should be followed.
                (d) If the bulk of the material is elevated to a high altitude, the wind
speed and bearing at that height from the CBRN BWM or other appropriate MET data
should be used. If the material extends continuously from near the ground to a high
elevation (above 50 m), the procedures for an elevated release should also be used.

          (2) Type T, Releases of TIM. Due to the differences in materials and release
types, hazard prediction methodology must be broken down into five cases.
                 (a) Case 1, Release From Nuclear-Waste or Radiological-Material Storage
Facilities. Nuclear waste and radiological materials are usually stored well below ground
level, usually in a special lead drum contained in concrete shelters. Damage to such a
facility may rupture some of the drums and release the radiological material into the
atmosphere over an extended period of time.
                 •   The release area will be localized, and the hazard area is not expected
to be very large. However, the cloud may be toxic at low levels for an extended period of
time.
               •    An exclusion zone of a 1-km radius around the suspected radiological
hazard should be established.
                 (b) Case 2, Release From an RDD. If a high level of radiation is detected
as a passing cloud, the release will likely have been intentional and involve large quantities
of radiological material, which may continue at toxic levels for a considerable downwind
distance.
                 •    The cloud of radiological particles will be transported like a biological
agent cloud, so the biological procedures from Appendix F for a Type S attack should be
used.
               •     If the radiological release is observed, the corresponding biological
attack Type P or R should be used.
                 (c) Case 3, Release From Biological-Agent Bunkers or Production
Facilities. Storage facilities for biological agents usually consist of underground concrete
shelters. These shelters are closer to the ground surface. Damage to such a facility may
release some biological material from the shelter into the atmosphere as a jet of biological
agent, smoke, dust, and soil. The release area will be localized, and the amount of viable
agent dispersed will likely be less than that dispersed from an efficient biological weapon.
However, since many biological agents require only a few inhaled organisms to affect a
person, the downwind distance of the hazard area may still be considerable.
                •    The biological-hazard area prediction procedures in Appendix F
should be used for a Type P attack. If the release takes more than 5 minutes, the latest
arrival time may need to be adjusted for the duration of the release. For wind speeds ≤10
kph, Type P must be used.
                 •     Hazard areas for extended duration releases should be recalculated as
a Type R attack where the end points of the line are the release location and the current
position of the front end of the cloud, using 1.5 times the mean wind speed.
               •      If the release is reported as continuous and the reported duration
exceeds 2 hours or is not reported, the procedures for Type S should be followed.
                 •   If the bulk of the material is elevated to a high altitude (above 50 m),
the wind speed and bearing at that height from the CBRN BWM or other appropriate MET
data should be used. If the material extends continuously from near the ground to a high
elevation, the procedures for an elevated release should also be used.

                 (d) Case 4, Release from a Chemical Stockpile or TIM Transport/Storage.
Incidents involving the release of chemical agents from a stockpile of munitions or bulk
storage will usually involve only a small number of munitions. In such a case, the
downwind hazard will be considerably smaller than that predicted using the procedures in
Appendix E. In the case of a chemical-agent release from a large number of munitions or
bulk storage of chemical agents, the agent quantity will be sufficient to warrant the use of
Appendix E. Because of their lower toxicity and stability, the incidental release of a TIM
from transport vehicles is expected to affect an area considerably smaller than that
predicted using the chemical-agent procedures. The procedure to use is determined as
follows:
                 •    If a chemical stockpile or bulk storage mass is released that exceeds
200 liters, use the procedures in Appendix E for the appropriate agent and persistency.
                •    If there is a small chemical stockpile mass released or if there is a
single leaking munition or TIM release from a transport vehicle, use the following
procedure (adapted from the Emergency Response Guidebook [ERG]).
                      o     Release Area. The release area is assumed to be a circle having
a radius equal to the isolation distance from the ERG (see Figure H-5). The 4-digit United
Nations (UN) or North American (NA) identification number should be annotated on line
INDIA. If the identification number or the ERG is not available, use a radius of 915
meters. If the distance is not found in the green section of the ERG, the orange section
should be consulted before using the default distance. If more information is available, a
different radius may be specified in GENTEXT. Draw the circle of the specified radius,
centered at the release location.
                      o     Protective Action Distance. Obtain the protective action distance
from the ERG using the 4-digit UN or NA identification number and the size of the spill as
annotated on line GOLF. If the size of the spill is not available, assume large (LRG). If the
identification number is not available, use a distance of 11 km. If the distance is not found
in the green section of the ERG, the orange section should be consulted before using the
default distance. If the spill is greater than 1,500 kg (extra large [XLG]), double the
protective action distance.

                      o   Wind Speed ≤10 kph. The wind direction is considered to be
variable, so draw another circle of radius equal to the protective action distance, centered at
the release location.
                      o     Wind Speed >10 kph. Draw a line in the downwind direction
starting at the release location, of a length equal to the protective action distance. (For the
remaining steps, follow the drawing procedures from Appendix E rather than from the
ERG.) Draw a line at the end of the downwind direction line, perpendicular to the
downwind direction. Extend the downwind direction line in the upwind direction a distance
equal to twice the release area radius. Draw two lines from the upwind end of the
downwind direction line to the perpendicular line at the other end, which are tangent to the
top and bottom of the release area circle (see Figure H-5).
                     o     Elevation. If the bulk of the material is elevated to a high
altitude, the wind speed and bearing at that height from the CBRN BWM or other
appropriate MET data should be used. If the material extends continuously from near the
ground to high elevation (above 50 m), the procedures for an elevated release should also be
used.
                     o     Limitations. The initial hazard area is considered valid until
additional information is available. When significant changes in weather conditions occur, a
recalculation must be carried out (see Appendix E).
                     (e)   Case 5, Release from a Bulk Storage Tank. Chemical storage
tanks can contain thousands of liters of TIC. Many of these chemicals exist as gases under
atmospheric conditions and are stored as a liquid under high pressure and low
temperatures. Some of the chemicals are extremely flammable as a vapor cloud. Damage



30 April 2009   FM 3-11.3/MCWP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56, C1                          H-15
to one of these tanks can result in the stored liquid being ejected very quickly as a large
pool of very cold liquid. The pool will evaporate to form a vapor cloud, which is denser than
the surrounding air due to the lower temperature and differences in molecular weight. This
cloud will initially be affected more by gravity than the wind. The cloud will begin to dilute
by being mixed with surrounding air. Eventually, the cloud will no longer be denser than
the air and will move with the air as any other vapor or aerosol cloud. At this point,
however, the cloud concentration will most likely be low enough that it is no longer toxic.
So, any prediction procedures must focus on the behavior of the cloud before it has been
diluted. This behavior will be different than that predicted by assuming the hazard area
with the ERG. A simplified hazard is comprised of a circle, with the release location at its
center. The radius of the circle should be 2 km for the daytime and 6 km for nighttime (see
Figure H-6).

          (3)   Hazard Prediction for Elevated Releases.
                 (a) If the release, momentum, or buoyancy carries the material
significantly (>50 m) above the ground surface, the hazard prediction should be repeated
using 2,000 m elevation from the CBRN BWM. The hazard area for an elevated release is
considered to be a combined hazard area, including spaces in between (see Figure H-7).

                 (b) If merging or combining hazard regions for elevated releases or
changing MET conditions involves two triangular hazard regions having downwind
directions that are different by more than 90 degrees, the regions to be merged should be
replaced with a circle of a radius equal to the larger of the downwind distances. The time of
arrival at a location should be the earliest time resulting from the BWM or CDM.
              (c) Changes in MET conditions in the following BWMs should be handled
in the same manner as using CDMs.
7.   NBC4 ROTA Report
     The NBC4 ROTA Report (Figure H-8, page H-18) is used to pass subsequent off-target
monitoring data or the results of a deliberate directed survey. The report will use the
information as described in Chapter III for lines ALFA, INDIA, QUEBEC, ROMEO,
SIERRA, TANGO, WHISKEY, YANKEE, and ZULU. Line GENTEXT in this message will
provide the initial background reading taken by the survey team for a nuclear or
radiological release. Readings for line ROMEO will indicate a reading above the initial
reported background reading and measured values for chemical and biological releases.
Decimals may be entered into line ROMEO if the reading is below 1 in the relevant unit of
measurement recorded (e.g., 0.123456 cGy/h).
     a.    Purpose. The purpose of the NBC4 ROTA report is to report detection data and
pass monitoring and survey results. This report is used for two cases. Case 1 is used if an
attack is not observed and the first indication of contamination is by detection. Case 2 is
used to report the measured contamination as a part of a survey or monitoring team
mission.
      b.  Precedence. All other messages after the initial NBC1 ROTA report has been
sent should be given a precedence, which reflects the operational value of the contents.
Normally, IMMEDIATE would be appropriate.

     c.     Preparation.
          (1) Contaminated areas are shown on the contamination situation map, and
information about them must be passed to the other units and higher HQ. The most
expeditious means for this is the contamination overlay.
             (2) The preparation of this overlay is described in each respective appendix
(e.g., for the chemical contamination overlay, refer to Appendix E). Overlays are preferred
for transmission of NBC3 and NBC5 ROTA reports (see Figure H-10, page H-20). They offer
the advantages of being readily usable and accurate, and they are in hard copy for future
references. Overlays have the disadvantages of requiring special equipment or messengers.

          •     Grid register marks.
   d.     Reporting Data.
          (1) Electronic communications are not always available. If this is the case, the
contamination overlay must be converted into a series of readings and coordinates for
transmission as an NBC5 ROTA report.
          (2) If electronic communications of the data or communications of a hard copy
are not available and if time and distance permit, contamination overlays are sent by
messenger. Data is transmitted manually by the NBC5 ROTA report as a last resort.
           (3) On the NBC5 ROTA report, a closed contour line on a plot is represented by
repeating the first coordinate.

                                          Appendix I 

                                   STRIKE WARNING 


1.   Background
     This appendix addresses friendly nuclear attack warning messages and procedures.
2.   Friendly Nuclear-Attack Warning
      The use of friendly nuclear attack warning is a vital part in the US ability to conduct
full-spectrum operations. It ensures the safety of US forces and their allies.
      a.   Nuclear STRIKWARN. STRIKWARN is a system for the warning of friendly
nuclear strikes. This system applies to nuclear strikes that may affect forces operating on
land, over land, or at sea. The requirement for a standard warning message and for the
delineation of the notification channels is essential to ensure that friendly units get a
timely warning of a friendly nuclear strike. This allows personnel and units to take the
appropriate measures to protect themselves and their equipment and still be prepared to
exploit the weapon effects.
     b.    Responsibilities. The responsibility for issuing a warning rests with the
coordinating commander. The coordinating commander is defined as the regional
commander who coordinates the activities of nuclear delivery and supporting units.
Commanders authorized to release nuclear strikes will ensure that strikes affecting the
safety of adjacent or other commands are coordinated. Commanders must allow sufficient
time to permit dissemination of the warnings to personnel so that they can take protective
measures, and they must prepare for exploiting the effects of the weapons.
    c.    Recipients. The commander responsible for disseminating the STRIKWARN
must inform the following units:
          (1)     Subordinate HQ whose units are likely to be affected by the strike.
           (2) Any land, air, and naval HQ/commands whose units are likely to be
affected by the strike.
        (3) Next higher level of command when the units that are not under the
command of the coordinating commander are likely to be affected by the strike.
           (4) Each unit concerned, down to the lowest level. Units will be warned by
their next higher HQ as to the level of the safety measures they should take, depending on
their proximity to the target.
NOTE: Only the information which is of direct interest to the units concerned
will be disseminated.
     d.   Warnings.
           (1) Impending STRIKWARN. A warning of an impending strike will be
initiated no earlier than is necessary to complete the warning of personnel. Any means of
communication chosen by the staff, preferably secure, will be used to ensure that all
affected personnel are warned.




2 February 2006   FM 3-11.3/MCRP 3-37.2A/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP(I) 3-2.56                   I-1
           (2) Use of Codes. STRIKWARN messages should be classified with regard to
current OPSEC instructions. If secure electronic means are not available, the message
should be encrypted. Only circuits and coding systems which meet the appropriate security
criteria will be used. Messages may be sent in the clear when the coordinating commander
determines that safety warnings override security requirements. A warning message will
not normally be sent in the clear earlier than 1 hour before the strike or time on target.
          (3) Precedence. Messages will be transmitted with the precedence adequate to
ensure the timely warning of all personnel expected to be affected by the strike.
           (4) Action on Canceled Attacks (Strikes). When strikes are canceled, the units
previously warned will be notified in the clear by the most expeditious means. The message
will be authenticated. For multiple strikes, all strikes have to be canceled before
disseminating cancellation messages. The target number or nickname of the strike should
be included.
          (5) Other Warnings. Dazzle warnings are to be passed to all flying units or
squadrons in the region. For dazzle warnings, only lines ALFA, DELTA, FOXTROT ONE
(designated ground zero [DGZ] only), and INDIA are sent.
      e.   NBC3 Reports. When line HOTEL of the STRIKWARN indicates a surface or
subsurface burst, an NBC3 report will be transmitted as soon as possible after the
STRIKWARN. The development and transmission of this message is the responsibility of
the coordinating commander anytime the analysis indicates that fallout could affect
friendly units.
      f.   Units of Measurement. Standard ground units of measure will be used for the
coordinates (UTM grid) and distance (meters). Organizations (e.g., Naval) which use
different units (e.g., LAT/LONG) will be responsible for converting the units for
retransmission to their subordinate units and for providing warning messages to land
forces in ground units when the effects of their weapons may be experienced by those land
forces.
      g.    Line Items Used in STRIKWARN Messages. The list of message line items in
Table I-1 provides an overview of the STRIKWARN message format, serves to give the user
a total picture of the line items available for the message, and provides the order of use for
line items.

      Zones of warning and protection signify various degrees of danger to US forces.
      a.    The MSD is equal to the radius of safety (RS) for the yield, plus a buffer distance
(BD) related to the dispersion of the weapon system used. When surface bursts are used or
an intended air burst having less than 99 percent assurance of no militarily significant
fallout, the fallout hazard will be considered. Details will be transmitted in a subsequent
NBC3 NUC message if fallout will be a hazard to friendly forces.
      b.  Commanders will be governed by the safety criteria in JP 3-12.2 or the specific
service manual addressing nuclear safety.
     c.  If a unit commander is unable to evacuate Zone 1, he will immediately require
the maximum protection and report through his next higher HQ to the releasing/executing
commander.
     d.    Negligible risk should not normally be exceeded unless significant advantage will
be gained.
     e.   Maximum protection for the ground forces denotes that personnel are in
buttoned-up tanks or sheltered in foxholes with an overhead shielding.
     f.    Minimum protection for ground forces denotes that personnel are prone on open
ground with all skin areas covered and with an overall thermal protection at least equal to
that provided by a two-layer uniform.

      g.   Since the least separation distance (LSD) for light aircraft is exceeded by MSD 2,
aircraft remaining beyond MSD 2 will avoid significant degradation of the aircraft or pilot
performance (except Dazzle) severe enough to prevent mission accomplishment.
      h.    When a unit receives a STRIKWARN message, the first action is to plot it on the
tactical (situation) map. This identifies GZ or DGZ and how far the MSDs extend. The
commander can then determine what actions to take. Figure I-1 shows a plotted
STRIKWARN for a single burst.




                                                         Team A should evacuate MSD 1 if possible.
                                                         Otherwise, the unit will have to dismount and take
                                                         cover in foxholes. Evacuation is the first choice,
                                                         followed by seeking shelter with overhead cover. If
                                         C               not evacuated, Team A may exceed the specified
                                                         risk. The other units will, as a minimum, assume a
                                                         prone position and protect against dazzle and EMP.
       MSD 2                     MSD 1                   However, those not in a warned, protected posture
                                                         may exceed the specified risk.

4.    Plotting a STRIKWARN Message
     Effectively plotting a STRIKEWARN message is paramount to establishing a unit’s
actions during a friendly nuclear attack.
      a.       Single Burst (Figure I-1).
       (1) Step 1. Locate the GZ grid coordinates from line FOXTROT of the
STRIKWARN message, and then plot GZ.
           (2) Step 2. Draw MSD circles around GZ. The first 3 digits of line FOXTROT is
the radius of the MSD.
               (3)   Step 3. Label the edge of the circles with the appropriate MSD.
          (4) Step 4. Label the marginal information on the map sheet. Marginal
information includes STRIKWARN message, NBC3 report, prepared-by unit, and map
scale.

         b.    Multiple Bursts (Figure I-2).
               (1)    Step 1. Plot the GZ for each burst from line FOXTROT of the STRIKWARN
    message.
               (2)    Step 2. Construct tangent lines from each point to form a box.
               (3)    Step 3. Label MSDs 1 and 2 along the corresponding tangent lines.
              (4) Step 4. Label the marginal information on the map sheet. Marginal
    information includes STRIKWARN message, NBC3 report, prepared-by unit, and map
    scale.

                        NOMOGRAMS, TABLES, AND GRAPHS 


     This appendix provides a single reference for nomograms, tables, and graphs. The
nomograms, tables, and graphs referenced in earlier appendixes will be found here. The
procedures to use them are found in the appropriate appendix.
NOTES:
1. Above 18,000 meters, altitude layers for plotting vector diagrams continue to be
at 2,000-meter intervals. However, the map distance factors vary so little that
some of the columns in Tables J-1 through J-6 (pages J-1 through J-3) are
combined for convenience.
2. Uses for Tables J-7 through J-13 (pages J-4 through J-9) and Figures J-1
through J-54 (pages J-10 through J-62) are referenced throughout the previous
chapters and appendixes of this manual.

Dose Rate for an Arbitrary Time (Kaufmann equation can be used as follows)

           n            n
     R1 ×t1 = R2 ×t 2 (can be mathematically changed to represent the missing (or
     objective) variable to read: R2 = R1 / (t2)n or R2 = R1 / NF)

Time at Which a Given Dose Rate is to be Expected (Kaufmann equation can be used as
follows)

               n            n
       R1 ×t1 = R2 ×t 2 (can be mathematically changed to represent the missing (or
       objective) variable to read: t2 = R1 x t1 / R2)

NOTE: If R1 is the normalized dose rate reading at H+1, then t1 will always be 1.
Therefore, the equation can be set up as: t2 = R1 / R2 This equation can only be utilized
per the validity time for the decay rate.

Total Dose Procedures:

 NOTE: For Category Total, see 1 below. For Overall Unit RES, see 2 below.
 1
   To determine Category Total, add total number of RESs (0,1,2, 3 for each element) “RES Category” column.
 2
   To determine Overall RES, Determine total number of elements. Enter the number of elements and continue down that column to
 locate the category total (Note 1) range, then read the RES category to the left or right.

 Example: A Unit had five (5) elements with a total RES Category of 11. Enter “5” as the number of elements. Using this column,
 locate “11”. “11” is between the range of “8-12”; read left or right: Overall RES would be RES-2.

MOPP. (JP 1-02)
Mission-oriented protective posture gear. Military term for individual protective
equipment including suit, boots, gloves, mask with hood, first aid treatments, and
decontamination kits issued to soldiers. Also called MOPP gear. (JP 1-02)
Nerve agent. A potentially lethal chemical agent which interferes with the transmission of
nerve impulses. (JP 1-02)
Nonpersistent agent. A chemical agent that when released dissipates and/or loses its
ability to cause casualties after 10 to 15 minutes. (JP 1-02)
Nuclear, biological, and chemical-capable nation. A nation that has the capability to
produce and employ one or more types of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons across
the full range of military operations and at any level of war in order to achieve political and
military objectives. (JP 1-02)
Nuclear, biological, and chemical defense. Defensive measures that enable friendly
forces to survive, fight, and win against enemy use of nuclear, biological, or chemical (NBC)
weapons and agents. US forces apply NBC defensive measures before and during
integrated warfare. In integrated warfare, opposing forces employ nonconventional
weapons along with conventional weapons (NBC weapons are nonconventional). (JP 1-02)

Nuclear, biological, and chemical environment. Environments in which there is
deliberate or accidental employment, or threat of employment, of nuclear, biological, or
chemical weapons; deliberate or accidental attacks or contamination with toxic industrial
materials, including toxic industrial chemicals; or deliberate or accidental attacks or
contamination with radiological (radioactive) materials. (JP 1-02)
Nuclear defense. The methods, plans, and procedures involved in establishing and
exercising defensive measures against the effects of an attack by nuclear weapons or
radiological warfare agents. It encompasses both the training for, and the implementation
of, these methods, plans, and procedures. (JP 1-02)
Persistency. In biological or chemical warfare, the characteristic of an agent which
pertains to the duration of its effectiveness under determined conditions after its dispersal.
(JP 1-02)
Persistent agent. A chemical agent that, when released, remains able to cause casualties
for more than 24 hours to several days or weeks. (JP 1-02)
Protection. Measures that are taken to keep nuclear, biological, and chemical hazards
from having an adverse effect on personnel, equipment, or critical assets and facilities.
Protection consists of five groups of activities: hardening of positions, protecting personnel,
assuming mission-oriented protective posture, using physical defense measures, and
reacting to attack. (JP 1-02)
Protective mask. A protective ensemble designed protect the wearer’s face and eyes and
prevent the breathing of air contaminated with chemical and/or biological agents. (JP 1-02)
Residual Contamination. Contamination which remains after steps have been taken to
remove it. These steps may consist of nothing more than allowing the contamination to
decay normally. (JP 1-02)
Survey. The directed effort to determine the location and the nature of a chemical,
biological, and radiological hazard in an area. (JP 1-02)
Toxic chemical. Any chemical which, through its chemical action on life processes, can
cause death, temporary incapacitation, or permanent harm to humans or animals. This
includes all such chemicals, regardless of their origin or of their method of production, and
regardless of whether they are produced in facilities, in munitions or elsewhere. (JP 1-02)
Toxic industrial biological—Biological materials (bacteria, viruses, and toxins) found in
medical research or pharmaceutical and other manufacturing processes that are toxic to
humans and animals or cause damage to plants. (FM 4-02.7)
Toxic Industrial Chemical. Chemical compounds used or produced in industrial
processes that are toxic to humans and animals, or cause damage to plants. (FM 4-02.7)
Toxic Industrial Materials. Toxic industrial materials may be toxic industrial chemical
(TIC), toxic industrial biological (TIB), and toxic industrial radiological (TIR) materials.
(FM 4-02.7)
Toxic Industrial Radiological. Radiation emitting materials used in research, power
generation, medical treatment, and other non-weapon developmental activities that are
harmful to humans and animals if released outside their controlled environments. (FM 4
