1.2. Phases of Training:
     1.2.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). This training is necessary to qualify aircrew
     for duties in the T-38 aircraft. See Chapter 2 for IQT program requirements. (T-2).
     1.2.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). This training is necessary to qualify
     aircrew for specific unit mission or local area requirements. (T-2). Training may be
     incorporated in MAJCOM-approved IQT syllabi. See Chapter 3 for MQT requirements.
     1.2.3. Continuation Training (CT). This training is necessary for qualified aircrew to
     maintain their assigned level of proficiency and/or increase flight qualifications. (T-2). It
     provides minimum ground and flight training event requirements. Squadron commanders
     will designate aircrew members as “experienced” or “inexperienced” for CT purposes. (T-2).
     For the purposes of this instruction, the wing commander, vice wing commander, OG
     commander, deputy OG commander, squadron commander, and squadron operations officer
     are designated as experienced aircrew. (T-2). Flight commanders are responsible for
     scheduling aircrew CT missions and flight training objectives for assigned or attached
     personnel. (T-2). Using MAJCOMs will detail their CT program in their MAJCOM
     supplement, including a MAJCOM definition of “experienced” aircrew. (T-2).
        1.2.3.1. Inexperienced Aircrew. Aircrew not designated as experienced will progress
        through a program managed by the flight commander to develop sound flying skills. (T-
        2). Flight commanders will tailor each program based on the new aircrew’s performance
        in IQT and past flying experience. (T-2). No time limit has been established to transition
        from inexperienced to experienced.
        1.2.3.2. CT Meetings. Commanders will direct and supervise periodic CT meetings for
        aircrew members. (T-2). The purpose of these meetings is to discuss standardization and
        mission-related topics and to increase general knowledge. A cockpit and/or crew resource
        management (CRM) topic or scenario should be discussed in each CT meeting referring
AFI11-2T-38V1 5 AUGUST 2014                                                                      5


       to CRM core concepts from AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training
       Program. Using MAJCOMs will detail CT meeting requirements in their MAJCOM
       supplement. (T-2).
       1.2.3.3. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Training. NVG training is not authorized. (T-2).
1.3. Training Concepts and Procedures:
   1.3.1. Unless specifically directed, the squadron commander will determine the level of
   supervision required to accomplish in-flight training. (T-2). If the mission objectives include
   introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, an instructor pilot (IP)
   may be required. If mission objectives require directed supervision, a squadron supervisor
   may be warranted.
   1.3.2. IPs and flight lead-qualified squadron supervisors may allow any pilot to lead limited
   portions of a mission if the pilot has been appropriately briefed. This provision will only be
   used to allow a pilot to practice events in which he or she is already qualified or to help
   determine if a pilot is ready for an upgrade program. (T-2). In either case, the IP or squadron
   supervisor is responsible for the flight. (T-2).
   1.3.3. Units will complete training requirements during the appropriate training cycle except
   where specifically excepted. (T-2). Using MAJCOMs will detail the training cycle in their
   MAJCOM supplement. (T-2).
1.4. Training Records and Reports. Units will:
   1.4.1. Maintain aircrew records for individual training and evaluations in accordance with
   (IAW) AFI 11-202, Volumes 1 and 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, and the
   RDS. (T-2).
   1.4.2. Maintain formal course or equivalent training records for assigned and attached
   aircrew. (T-2).
   1.4.3. Maintain documentation for each certification in the individual’s training records, or
   on an AF IMT 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training, or AF Form 4348, USAF
   Aircrew Certifications. (T-2).

                                            Chapter 2

                       INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING (IQT)

2.1. General. This chapter outlines the IQT program for the T-38. The primary method of
initial qualification is to attend and complete the appropriate formal training course listed in
education and training course announcement (ETCA). Completing the appropriate formal course
satisfies basic qualification training requirements. When attendance is not practical or quotas are
not available, units will request waivers from the MAJCOM/A3 to conduct in-unit qualification
training, using formal school courseware. (T-1).
   2.1.1. Upon completion of the IQT program, aircrew will be qualified IAW AFI 11-202,
   Volume 2; and AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 2, T-38 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria. (T-2).
   2.1.2. Except in unusual circumstances, aircrew members undergoing IQT will receive
   ground and flight instruction with minimum interruption and complete training within the
   time specified by the syllabus. For formal training course IQT, failure to complete training
   within the specified time limit requires notifying the gaining wing commander of the
   aircrew’s name and grade, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated completion date.
   (T-2).
2.2. Prerequisites. Before entering qualification training, each aircrew member must comply
with the appropriate formal course training prerequisites. (T-2). In addition, all personnel
maintaining flying status will meet the physical examination; physiological training; and
survival, evasion, resistance, and escape (SERE) training requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 1,
before flying. (T-2).
2.3. Ground Training. Ground training will follow the formal course syllabus flow, but may
be tailored to local conditions and the individual’s background and experience. (T-2). For in-unit
qualification training, commanders will obtain and use current formal school courseware, if
available. (T-2).
2.4. Flying Training. Aircrew in IQT will fly under IP supervision until completing the
qualification evaluation unless otherwise specified by their MAJCOM supplement. (T-2). Formal
course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements for IQT. (T-2).
Additional training due to student nonprogression is available within the constraints of the
formal course syllabus. Pilots may satisfy MQT and upgrade training requirements during IQT if
the appropriate IP is available and the formal course training allows it.
2.5. Senior Officer Qualification. Comply with the guidance provided in AFI 11-401, Aviation
Management, and AFI 11-202, Volume 1. (T-2).
2.6. Flight Surgeon (FS) Training:
   2.6.1. Ground Training. Ground training will include: (T-2)
       2.6.1.1. Aircraft general review.
       2.6.1.2. Cockpit and/or crew resource management (CRM) training IAW AFI 11-290.
       2.6.1.3. Aircrew flight equipment and procedures training IAW AFI 11-301, Volume 1,
       Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program.

        2.6.1.4. Egress training IAW AFI 11-301, Volume 1.
        2.6.1.5. An instrument and emergency procedure (EP) review with an instructor.
        2.6.1.6. The completion of an FS examination IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
     2.6.2. Flying Training. A FS is allowed to occupy the RCP. An FS will not operate the
     controls unless an IP is at the controls and will not fly during critical phases of flight. (T-2).
2.7. Requalification Training. An aircrew member is unqualified upon expiration of his or her
qualification evaluation or loss of currency exceeding 6 months (paragraph 4.3). (T-2). Follow
the requalification guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 1. (T-2).
2.8. IP Requalification Training. See paragraph 4.4.2.
2.9. Conversion and/or Difference Qualification. Conversion qualification follows the
guidance in this chapter and the formal course conversion syllabus. Difference training is
authorized for pilots converting from the T-38C to the T-38A/B or vice a versa. MAJCOMs will
provide difference training guidance. (T-2).

                             CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT)

4.1. General. This chapter outlines minimum ground and flying training requirements for T-38
aircrew CT. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of aircrew training in the basic flying
skills, which ensures safe operation of the aircraft. The second consists of specific mission-
related training required to accomplish the unit's assigned missions or taskings. Taskings may be
locally generated or higher headquarters directed. Using MAJCOMs will define additional
currencies and requirements in their MAJCOM supplement. (T-2).
4.2. Ground Training. Ground training accomplished during IQT and MQT may be credited
toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished. AFI 11-202,
Volume 1, specifies ground training requirements. Using MAJCOMs may specify additional
ground training requirements in their MAJCOM supplement. Units will track ground training
requirements in ARMS. (T-2).
4.3. Flying Training Currencies and Recurrency:
   4.3.1. Currency. Table 4.1 lists minimum currency requirements for T-38 aircrew. (T-2).
   Using MAJCOMs may specify additional events or sortie currencies in their MAJCOM
   supplement. If an aircrew member loses a particular currency, he or she may not perform that
   sortie or event except to regain currency. (T-2).

 NOTES:
 1. See paragraph 4.3.3 of this instruction.
 2. Non-current pilots will increase their weather minimum by one category.
 3. Instrument approach currency may be updated from either cockpit when flown in simulated
 instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) with a qualified safety observer or during actual
 IMC. MAJCOMs determine limitations when instrument approach currency is expired.
 4. Rear cockpit (RCP) landings update both RCP landing currency and normal landing
 currency. FCP landing currency is good day or night.
 5. Accomplish night landings between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of
 morning civil twilight. To regain RCP night landing currency, three night landings must be
 accomplished from the RCP and the FCP IP must be qualified (not necessarily current) in FCP
 and RCP night landings. See paragraph 4.3.2 of this instruction.
AFI11-2T-38V1 5 AUGUST 2014                                                                     11


   4.3.2. Recurrency. Recurrency is required when an aircrew member does not meet a
   currency requirement in this instruction. (T-2). Supervision level is a current and qualified
   instructor in the aircraft or element. (T-2). Training identified as “affects basic aircraft
   qualification (BAQ)” requires regression to an unqualified status until recurrency training is
   completed. (T-2). Unless otherwise specified in this instruction, supervisory requirements
   pertaining to recurrency may be satisfied in the flight position that offers the best control of
   the mission, as determined by the squadron commander.
   4.3.3. Landing Recurrency. Landing currency is required to maintain BAQ. (T-2). Loss of
   landing currency over 210 days (225 days experienced) requires requalification training IAW
   AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 2. (T-2). Loss of landing currency less
   than 210 days (225 days experienced) requires the following action: (Note: Timing starts
   from last landing.) (T-2)
       4.3.3.1. For 31 to 90 Days (46 to 90 Days Experienced). Accomplish at least three
       satisfactory landings with a landing-current IP.
       4.3.3.2. For 91 to 135 Days. Comply with the actions in paragraph 4.3.3.1 and complete
       an instructor-supervised EP and instrument review session (normal, emergency, and
       instrument procedures).
       4.3.3.3. For 136 to 210 Days (to 225 days Experienced). Comply with the actions in
       paragraphs 4.3.3.1 and 4.3.3.2, and complete the qualification written examinations and
       an emergency procedures evaluation (EPE). Documentation of AF 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Qualification, is not required.
4.4. Special Categories:
   4.4.1. Instructor Event or Sortie Currency. If an instructor becomes noncurrent in an
   event or sortie not affecting basic aircraft qualification BAQ, instructor status may be
   retained, but he or she will not instruct in that event or sortie until the required currency is
   regained. (T-2). Table 4.1 lists supervision required for recurrency training.
   4.4.2. Loss of Instructor Qualification and Requalification. An instructor will be
   unqualified for: (T-2)
       4.4.2.1. Cause IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
       4.4.2.2. A failed flight evaluation. To regain instructor status, an instructor must
       successfully complete a flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
       4.4.2.3. A failed qualification or instrument written examination. To regain instructor
       status, an instructor must successfully re-accomplish the written examination.
   4.4.3. Demanding Sortie. MAJCOMs will list sorties or events requiring demanding sortie
   currency in their MAJCOM supplement. (T-2). Aircrew who do not have demanding sortie
   or event currency will not participate in demanding sorties without the proper level of
   supervision as determined by the squadron commander. (T-2).
   4.4.4. Flight Surgeon (FS). FSs will accomplish CT IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1. (T-2).
   4.4.5. Higher Headquarters API-8 Aircrew. For training other than that conducted in
   support of a formal inspection, higher headquarters personnel must coordinate with the
   supporting unit as follows: (T-2)
 12                                                        AFI11-2T-38V1 5 AUGUST 2014


      4.4.5.1. Aircrew will ensure appropriate ARMS data is maintained and provided IAW
      AFI 11-401.
      4.4.5.2. Units will review the qualifications and currencies of higher headquarters-
      assigned aircrew before authorizing them to fly. Units will evaluate the demands of each
      mission scenario and ensure higher headquarters-assigned aircrew ability and proficiency
      will not be exceeded.
      4.4.5.3. Aircrew will submit qualification and authorization documentation to the
      supporting squadron commander or operations officer prior to flying with that squadron.
4.5. Annual Training Requirements:
   4.5.1. Minimum Annual Requirements. MAJCOMs will determine minimum annual
   requirements. Sorties and events accomplished during MQT may be credited toward CT
   requirements for the training cycle in which they were accomplished. Before an aircrew
   member who fails to meet minimum CT requirements may fly in the new training cycle, the
   OG commander will determine if additional training is required. (T-2). (Note: Additional
   training may be required, depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency.)
   4.5.2. CT Profiles. Squadron Commanders will approve profiles for all required CT sorties.
   (T-2). Profiles will detail the minimum events and currency items to be accomplished on the
   sortie (T-2) (for example, aircraft handling characteristics [AHC] maneuvers, approaches, or
   emergency patterns and landings).
   4.5.3. Prorating Requirements. Squadron commanders:
      4.5.3.1. May prorate training requirements IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, at the end of the
      training cycle.
      4.5.3.2. Will prorate requirements only to adjust for genuine circumstances of training
      non-availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies. (T-2).
      4.5.3.3. Will consider newly assigned or qualified pilots who achieve qualification after
      the 15th of the month to be in CT on the first day of the following month. (T-2).
4.6. Multiple Qualification Requirements. MAJCOMs will specify which sorties and events
flown in other aircraft may be used to satisfy T-38 sortie and event requirements in their
MAJCOM supplement.
4.7. Multiple Qualification Currencies. MAJCOMs will specify which sorties and events
flown in other aircraft may be used to satisfy T-38 currencies in their MAJCOM supplement.

                         SPECIALIZED TRAINING PROGRAMS

5.1. Overview. This chapter outlines upgrade training programs for special capabilities and
qualifications. These programs are intended to provide a basic starting point and may need to be
modified by the squadron commander, based on the unit’s requirements and the aircrew’s
previous experience, qualifications, and documented performance. Unless governed by a formal
course syllabus, ground and device training for these programs will consist of unit-developed
academics and scenarios. (T-2). Flight training will be conducted IAW a program approved by
the squadron commander. (T-2). Using MAJCOMs may specify additional specialized training
programs in their MAJCOM supplement.
5.2. Instructor Upgrade. Follow a MAJCOM-approved formal course syllabus. (T-2).
5.3. RCP Night Landing Qualification Training:
   5.3.1. Spatial Disorientation (SD) Ground Training. SD ground training will consist of
   both an SD briefing and an SD training system demonstration that focus on prevention,
   recognition and recovery. (T-2). SD briefing requirements are met by currency in the
   instrument refresher course. If an SD training system is not available, ground training may
   consist of an SD briefing only, but special emphasis on SD prevention, recognition and
   recovery must be made during the briefing. (T-2).
   5.3.2. Flying Training. For initial qualification, an IP qualified in RCP night landings must
   occupy the FCP. (T-2). The IP being night qualified will accomplish a minimum of three
   RCP landings. (T-2). Night landings to gain or regain night landing qualification will be
   accomplished between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil
   twilight. (T-2).
5.4. Formation and/or Flight Lead Upgrade. Using MAJCOMs will publish formation and/or
flight lead training programs in their MAJCOM supplement. Completion of a formal course
syllabus may satisfy this requirement.
5.5. Low Altitude Training Upgrade. Using MAJCOMs will publish low altitude upgrade
programs in their MAJCOM supplement. Completion of a formal course syllabus may satisfy
this requirement.
5.6. Functional Check Flight (FCF) Training. MAJCOMs will publish FCF pilot training
requirements in their MAJCOM supplements.
