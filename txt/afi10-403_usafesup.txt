Section 1A—Department of Defense

1.1. General. Effective deployment planning and execution capabilities extend our operational
limits, thereby allowing us to anticipate requirements while remaining flexible, adaptable and
responsive to changing conditions. Every Airman must continue to understand our ever-
evolving AEF construct and how roles and responsibilities represent essential components of any
military activity. This instruction not only provides an authoritative basis for the subsequent
development of education, training, logistics and procedures, it serves as a conceptual framework
for understanding and practicing effective deployment planning and execution to Airmen at all
levels of command.
1.2. Secretary of Defense (SecDef).
   1.2.1. Pursuant to his responsibilities set out in 10 USC §162, SecDef and the 2010-2012
   Guidance for Employment of the Force (GEF) approves the Global Force Management
   Allocation Plan (GFMAP), which authorizes Combatant Commanders (CCDR) and
   Secretaries of the military Departments to deploy forces to support CCDR requirements.
   GFM is the process the SecDef and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) use to
   assign forces to CCDRs for mission accomplishment and allocate additional forces to
   CCDRs in the event of contingency operations and apportion forces for CCDR planning in
   the event contingency operations escalate.
       1.2.2. Has adjudication authority for prioritizing competing CCDR requirements,
       approving force allocation actions, transferring operational control to supported
       commander by attaching forces, and making the determination to surge or limit forces.
1.3. Combatant Commander (CCDR).
       1.3.1. Submits requirements for rotational, exercise, contingency, and Individual
       Augmentee (IA) forces throughout the annual GFM Rotational Force Allocation Process.
   1.3.2. Submits Request For Forces and Request For Capabilities (RFF/RFC) through the
   GFM process to accomplish assigned missions in accordance with CJCSM 3122.01A,
   Enclosure R, JOPES Volume I (Planning Policies and Procedures), and CJCSM 3122.02C,
   Appendix A to Enclosure F, JOPES Volume III (Crisis Action TPFDD Development and
   Deployment Execution.
1.4. Director of Operations, Joint Staff (JCS/J3).
   1.4.1. Designates the Joint Staff (JS/J31) as the Global Conventional Joint Force Coordinator
   (JFC) to execute all conventional force sourcing/coordination actions previously executed by
   CDRUSJFCOM IAW GFM Implementation Guidance (GFMIG).
       1.4.2. In coordination with the Services, orchestrates the force flow of allocated units.
   1.4.3. Designates USTRANSCOM as the Joint Force Provider (JFP) for mobility forces.
       1.4.4. Designates USSOCOM as the JFP for special operations forces.

     issues.
        1.8.1.7.1. IAW AFDD 1, Air Force Basic Doctrine, Organization, and Command,
        DIRLAUTH is that authority granted by a commander (any level) to a subordinate to
        directly consult or coordinate an action with a command or agency within, or outside
        of, the granting command.
            1.8.1.7.2. DIRLAUTH is not TACON and is applicable to planning and
            operational activities only. It carries with it the requirement of keeping the
            commander granting DIRLAUTH informed.
            1.8.1.7.3. DIRLAUTH is therefore a coordination relationship, not an authority
            through which command may be exercised. As such, the IDO coordinates as
            necessary, with appropriate squadron and group commanders for deployment
            preparation and execution issues. This coordination is DIRLAUTH ( Figure 1.2.).

        worst-case scenario (WCS), as defined in this AFI, by validating, approving and
        documenting the need for additional personnel resources to support host/tenant unit
        deployment requirements.
            1.8.1.13.1. At installations where ARC and active duty are co-located,
            deployment related Operating Instructions (OI) will be coordinated through each
            component’s senior commander prior to finalization.
            1.8.1.13.2. MAJCOMs for joint bases will appoint a senior Air Force
            representative as the OPR for this program.

     commanders will ensure their UDMs and Increment Monitors attend host
     installation/wing LRS-sponsored IDS training classes. NOTE: Participation ensures
     students comprehend the importance of IDS as it pertains to automating and streamling
     the installation deployment process for all deployments, regardless of size or scope and
     achieving ITV.
     1.9.1.22. Conduct a monthly review of all standard UTCs postured in the UTA and
     updates the ART IAW AFI 10-244 and immediately identifies any shortfalls to the IDO.
     1.9.1.23. Ensure all UTC deployable cargo is properly prepared to move within the
     Defense Transportation System (DTS), to include appropriate ITV documentation (See
     AFI 24-203, Paragraph 18.8.1 and all sub-paragraphs), as well as ensuring unit personnel
     can immediately respond to the transportation function to reconcile any frustrated cargo.
     NOTE: Ensure unit representatives are identified as classified and/or cargo couriers, as
     required, to accompany equipment and supplies on assigned lift for accountability.
     1.9.1.24. Ensure UDMs or designated representatives collect and provide to the IDO or
     CMOS/GATES operator the required emergency contact information for each deploying
     member to complete advanced manifesting IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Part III.
     1.9.1.25. Ensure accomplishment of a risk analysis during pre-deployment planning to
     identify and ensure abatement of potential hazards. It is important to review as much of
     the deployment details prior to departure, as this will enable the correction or mitigation
     of many hazards before they become mishaps. AFPAM 91-216, USAF Safety
     Deployment and Contingency Pamphlet, assists commanders and planners in the
     evaluation and mitigation of risks associated with deployments and contingencies.
     Ensure units conduct deployment operations in a professional military manner with a
     sense of urgency and keen situational awareness. Personnel will immediately correct
     unsafe conditions.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                        55


     1.9.1.26. Ensure deploying civilians have appropriate CAC, Geneva Convention card,
     passport, and/or visas when required. Ensure E-E civilian personnel are prepared and
     trained to deploy IAW this instruction, AFI 36-507 and AFI 36-2201.
     1.9.1.27. When OPLANs, deployment taskings, or the Supported Commander’s
     reporting instructions do not authorize the hand carrying of individual weapons by
     deploying personnel, unit commanders must appoint primary and alternate weapons (or
     ammunition) courier/custodians, when required to bulk ship unit weapons and/or
     ammunition.
        1.9.1.27.1. This will be accomplished in writing to the DCC, with a copy to Materiel
        Management Flight (LRS/LGRM) Small Arms Managers, to ensure the security and
        accountability of weapons and ammunition while en route from origin to the final
        destination.
        1.9.1.27.2. It is the deploying unit's responsibility to ensure appointed couriers are
        knowledgeable of policies and procedures associated with resource protection, use of
        deadly force, and equipment accountability.
        1.9.1.27.3. Units are encouraged to seek assistance from the host wing Security
        Forces Squadron to develop weapons courier training plans tailored to the deploying
        unit's specific resource protection needs.
     1.9.1.28. Ensure mobility bags, weapons, munitions, and insect vector requirements are
     established and filled based on the units/wings maximum simultaneous deployment
     capability. Refer to AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management, for
     base-level positioning guidance for Category-B (Mobility) munitions for miscellaneous
     units defined in Air Force Catalog (AFCAT) 21-209, Volume 1, Ground Munitions.
        1.9.1.28.1. Coordinate storage, accountability, and maintenance of mobility bags
        (including first aid kits), insect vector requirements, weapons, and munitions with the
        LRS commander.
        1.9.1.28.2. Required quantities are procured and maintained IAW AFMAN 23-110
        and AOR reporting instructions.
     1.9.1.29. Ensure Airmen postured against UTCs P-coded as DW and DX in the UTA
     (including A-coded UTCs and Institutional Force personnel tasked for deployment) have
     an AFDF containing the items listed as outlined within Table A3.1, Deployment Folder
     Table of Contents, of this instruction. Personnel filling DW and DX positions should
     maintain the highest state of readiness, have their affairs in order, and have an AFDF
     maintained by the UDM.
        1.9.1.29.1. Make every effort to ensure shortfalls are mitigated prior to a member’s
        deployment window. It is also recommended that Airmen postured in all other coded
        UTCs have their affairs in order and AFDFs current for possible short-notice tasking
        requirements.
        1.9.1.29.2. UDMs will build hard copy, six-part AFDFs (NSN: 7530-00-990-8884 or
        suitable substitute) for all UTCs P-coded as DW and DX in the UTA (including A-
        coded UTCs and Institutional Force personnel identified for deployment). At the
        IDO’s discretion, Part V of an AFDF may be used for additional documentation, if
56                                         AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


        necessary to facilitate deployment out-processing and AOR in-processing. Local
        guidance regarding the use and contents of Part V of an AFDF must be published in
        the installation/wing IDP.
     1.9.1.30. Commanders or equivalent will be responsible for determining the appropriate
     AEFI code for all assigned personnel. MAJCOM FAMs and UDMs in conjunction with
     the IDRC will advise Unit commanders of recommended AEFIs to correct erroneous or
     blank AEFIs and will suspense commanders for corrective action. Further, MAJCOM
     FAMs will monitor AEFIs to ensure Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) that is normally
     associated within their functional areas is evenly distributed as possible throughout
     associated vulnerability periods.
        1.9.1.30.1. Assign all military personnel to a specific AEFI code in MilPDS within
        15-days of Date Arrived Station (DAS). To facilitate this effort, commanders will
        revise their unit in-processing checklists requiring newly assigned personnel to work
        with their designated UDM and be assigned to an AEFI prior to taking leave (e.g.
        permissive TDY for house-hunting).
        1.9.1.30.2. At the start of each GFM cycle (October), organization commanders (or
        equivalent) will review AEFI codes to ensure distribution meets the needs of the
        organization.
        1.9.1.30.3. Ensure Airmen are aware of their AEFI and associated AEF vulnerability
        periods. Furthermore, commanders will inform Airmen of planned unit taskings
        according to applicable Consolidated Planning Schedule (CPS).
     1.9.1.31. Deployments are generally divided into three main phases – pre-deployment,
     deployment and post-deployment. All three phases within the deployment cycle are
     distinct and pose challenges and needs for preparation. Commanders are responsible for
     ensuring deploying Airmen know, before departing, the entire expected deployment
     period to include pre-deployment en route training, the estimated tour length and any
     overlap required at the end of the tour. This will help facilitate and ensure Airmen not
     only have their personal but professional affairs in order at all times to avoid poor
     planning for any part of the deployment cycles that can negatively impact family
     stability, individual readiness, unit cohesion and ultimately the ability to meet the
     mission.
     1.9.1.32. Upon redeployment, request tailored support from various CAIB/IDS-Delivery
     helping agencies for personnel and their families.
        1.9.1.32.1. Consult with and are trained by CAIB/IDS-Delivery agencies on their
        redeployment support roles and responsibilities.
        1.9.1.32.2. Encourage family member participation in CAIB/IDS-Delivery agency
        activities supporting the AEF schedule.
        1.9.1.32.3. Proactive command responses include: early recognition of readjustment
        difficulty, eliminating derogatory feelings towards the use of readjustment support,
        and facilitation of help-seeking behavior.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                         57


        1.9.1.32.4. Actions during reintegration education and the AEF schedule will
        include: observation, screening, identification, referral, and follow-up support for
        personnel recovery.
        1.9.1.32.5. Critical components supporting personnel recovery include: reintegration
        education, post deployment assistance, health care, spiritual support, childcare, and
        trauma response care.
        1.9.1.32.6. Ensure completion of redeployment processing of their personnel and
        support each individual to make a smooth post-deployment transition.
        1.9.1.32.7. IAW DODI 6490.03, the DOD mandated a series of Deployment Health
        Assessments (DHAs) designed to identify deployment health concerns before, during
        and after deployment. Commanders must ensure UDMs track compliance with all
        deployment health requirements for unit Airmen and government civilians.
     1.9.1.33. Commanders who have mission essential contracts will comply with DODI
     1100.22, Policy and Procedures for Determining Workforce Mix, and DODI 3020.41,

        1.9.1.33.1. Develop contingency plans for execution of mission essential services per
        DODI 1100.22.
        1.9.1.33.2. Review new and existing contracts and identify mission essential services
        performed by contractors that are required during crisis. Ensure identification of
        mission essential services are in the contract SOW.
        1.9.1.33.3. Track contractor personnel who are performing or who would perform
        mission essential services. Include their family members in non-combatant
        evacuation planning.
        1.9.1.33.4. Provide essential personnel information on contractors selected for
        deployment to the IPR. Ensure the contractor receives appropriate Letters of
        Introduction (LOI) and required contractor information is entered into DCAPES for
        proper accountability.
     1.9.1.34. Coordinate with IDO to access organization's comprehensive UTA
     requirements necessary to maximize available resources to better enable the organization
     to provide relevant capabilities to known future CCDR requirements.
     1.9.1.35. Submit formal request to AFPC/DPW (AEF Online Help Desk) to grant up to
     (3) UDMs access to the AEF Online Commander’s Toolkit. Ensure UDMs receive
     training regarding the use of the Commander’s Toolkit and the proper management and
     protection of the information contained within it. UDMs will use the toolkit to its fullest
     capacity to effectively manage individual readiness status and outstanding requirements
     for all assigned Airmen, to include: AEFI assignments and IMR notifications to Airmen.
     1.9.1.36. Recommend UTC deployable Airmen register for an unclassified AEF Online
     account in order to access the Personnel Deployment Preparedness Tool (PDPT).
        1.9.1.36.1. PDPT affords deployable Airmen access to key deployment information
        such as Duty and Security Clearance status, AEFI assignment, Medical Readiness
58                                         AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


         status and status of requisite Total Force Awareness (TFA), and Tier 2A pre-
         deployment training requirements.
         1.9.1.36.2. Airmen formally tasked to deploy, as directed by their unit commander
         and/or UDMs should use the PDPT to manage the status of requisite Tier 2B pre-
         deployment training requirements.
         1.9.1.36.3. Airmen should address PDPT readiness questions to their designated
         UDMs and/or Unit Health Monitors (UHM).
     1.9.1.37. Special Tactics, Tactical Air Control Parties (TACP) and other Air Force units
     directly supporting and assigned to Army installations are waived from the requirements
     in this instruction, but must comply with MAJCOM guidance, including guidance
     mandating use of all or some portions of this instruction.
         1.9.1.37.1. Comply with the deployment planning requirements outlined in Army
         host base deployment plans and other applicable Army installation regulations.
         1.9.1.37.2. Unitsmust still use LOGMOD and comply with LOGMOD UTC
         management reporting requirements IAW AFI 10-401.
  1.9.2. Training Requirements/Unit Personnel Readiness.
     1.9.2.1. The unit commander ensures unit personnel identified against a position in a
     UTC postured in the UTA are prepared for deployment within the AEF rotational
     construct IAW AFI 36-2201, AFI 10-401, AFI 31-207, AFI 10-2501, AFI 36-507, and
     this instruction.
     1.9.2.2. Units will ensure all military and E-E civilians receive appropriate deployment
     training and meet deployment requirements IAW the respective policy guidance
     referenced for each.         NOTE: Whenever possible, ancillary and EST are
     provided/executed via CBT using the ADLS.
     1.9.2.3. Personnel assigned against UTCs coded DX or DP can be trained and equipped,
     or have access to equipment IAW MAJCOM FAM guidance in case the equipment is
     shared with another UTC, to the maximum extent constrained resources allow.
     1.9.2.4. Personnel assigned against UTCs coded DP do not require equipping beyond
     what is required at their home station for their wartime mission.
     1.9.2.5. UTCs already permanently assigned to forward areas will normally require all
     equipment required to deploy to that location.
     1.9.2.6. Upon notification of a deployment tasking, any remaining training requirements
     must be fulfilled within time to meet the ALD. NOTE: If directed response times in the
     MISCAP or DOC statement preclude units from completing Tier 2B training
     requirements on a just-in-time basis, the owning MAJCOM/Directorate may direct this
     training to be completed on a recurring basis (i.e. annually).
         1.9.2.6.1. IAW AFI 10-401, the AEFSG resolves management of constrained
         resources, scheduling conflicts, and policy discrepancies. Combat Arms (CA),
         CBRN Defense Training, and Expeditionary Combat Skills materials, facilities and/or
         personnel and are usually accomplished through just-in-time training. All other

        training will be accomplished by all personnel IAW AFI 36-2201 to ensure the
        training is completed and remains current throughout the member’s deployment.
        1.9.2.6.2. Commanders should keep in mind that while DX-coded UTCs are not
        normally available for deployment under non-surge ops within their aligned AEF,
        under USAF A3/5 declared minimum surge rotational conditions these DX UTCs
        may be tasked in their on-call periods of surge ahead of the unit’s DW UTCs in the
        second on-call period up to the maximum total DWs, IAW AFI 10-401, Chapter 7. If
        at all possible, commanders should not defer deployment training to “just-in-time” for
        DX assigned people, since they could be required to deploy short notice during a
        crisis and “just-in-time” training might not be possible.
     1.9.2.7. Referenced functional publications could levy additional training requirements
     for some or all individuals who are identified against a UTA position.
     1.9.2.8. Additional deployed training requirements are normally identified by ULN line
     remarks and/or reporting instructions. The Pre-Deployment Training Tool (PDTT) is
     available on the SIPRNET AEF Online webpage and provides training scheduling
     information by ULN.
     1.9.2.9. Civilian personnel postured to deploy will meet all of the deployment training
     requirements established by their military counterparts. AFI 36-507 outlines any
     additional training and processing requirements that may be necessary.
     1.9.2.10. Commanders of ANG and AFRC personnel must ensure MPA man-days are
     requested and orders are received as soon as possible.
     1.9.2.11. The unit commander or designated representative must track and ensure all
     personnel assigned a UTA position meet all medical and additional deployment
     requirements at all times ensuring rapid response to a situation and/or locally approved

        information via the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) Portal
        (MyBiz/MyWorkplace) at https:compo.dcpds.cpms.osd.mil/. Once updated,
        they must provide a printed copy of their Emergency Contact Receipt from the
        MyBiz website to their UDM(s) for review. NOTE: Copies of the DCPDS
        Emergency Contact Receipt are prohibited from being posted or maintained in an
        AFDF at any time. If required by the CCDR for in-processing purposes,
        deploying DOD Civilians will hand-carry a copy of their DCPDS Emergency
        Contact Receipt separately from the AFDF.
        1.9.2.11.4.2. When conducting AFDF reviews with an Airman, UDMs must
        review the Airman’s vRED for accuracy and completeness as outlined in AFI 36-
        3002, Casualty Services. At a minimum, UDMs must emphasize the importance
        of accurate EPC information to ensure the proper military benefits are provided to
        an Airman’s beneficiaries. NOTE: UDMs should ensure an Airman’s religious
        preference listed on their vRED is identical to that reflected on the Airman’s
        Identification Tags (Dog Tags).
     1.9.2.11.5. Quantitative Fit Testing (QNFT) will be accomplished for each military

                                           Chapter 2

                                DEPLOYMENT PLANNING

Section 2A—Planning Overview

2.1. General. Transportation to and from an AOR can be confusing to both leaders and the
deploying/deployed Airmen. Leaders who understand the transportation process and how to
efficiently transport their Airmen using the newest AEF concepts can maintain 100% visibility of
their personnel and equipment. These informed leaders can also reduce stress and anxiety for
their Airmen by reducing travel time and making the travel experience better. This chapter
describes functional roles and responsibilities for the planning, preparation and execution of Air
Force deployment planning. Most of this occurs in the pre-deployment activity phase, which is
the first of four deployment phases. The other three phases are movement to and activities at the
port of embarkation; movement to the port of debarkation; and joint reception, staging, onward
movement, and integration (JRSOI) activities and will be covered in subsequent chapters.
   2.1.1. Air Force Planning Process. The Air Force deployment process begins when planning
   is initiated for force projection operations in response to an action or event that requires
   protection of U.S. national interests. Actions or events which could trigger the deployment
   process could fall under the full range of military operations (ROMO) and include natural
   disasters, civil support, foreign humanitarian assistance (FHA), Security Assistance,
   Homeland Defense/Security (HLD/S), United Nations (UN) actions and support to regional
   organizations (e.g. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) operations), etc.
   2.1.2. Planning Considerations. Planners must consider use of a combination of pre-
   positioned materiel, HNS agreements, ACSAs, and contingency contracts, when planning
   deployments and tailoring unit-level personnel and equipment requirements.
   2.1.3. Scope of Planning. As in joint deployment planning, AF planners must view
   deployment in the context of overall operational planning. Deployment planners at all levels
   must consider not only the actual deployment of forces, but also the employment mission,
   expeditionary organization structure, command relationships, the reception of forces, pre-
   positioning strategies, HNS, information systems, forward basing, and en route
   infrastructure.
2.2. Deployment Planning Challenges.
   2.2.1. Force Structure. Commanders and planners can only plan with current forces. The
   Air Force’s total combat capability is aligned in the UTA, via GFM Planning Cycle, and is
   used to meet the global needs of all CCDRs. In order for the AF to meet National Military
   Strategy (NMS) objectives in regard to weapons, units, personnel, equipment and supplies
   for both permanently assigned and rotational forces, the AEF is the primary method for
   meeting and sustaining these objectives.
   2.2.2. Transportation/Mobility Assets. Airlift and tanker aircraft, aircrews, aerial port
   personnel, and MHE are limited assets and must be used wisely or risk being wasted.
   Wings/units must ensure their deployment processes and systems are kept up to date through
   aggressive training and exercise programs.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                         69


   2.2.3. In-transit Visibility. Commanders at all levels rely heavily upon information systems
   to provide visibility of the movement of forces. Tracking force closure is critical to the
   CCDR ability to begin operations.         Those systems require the highest levels of
   communications security (COMSEC) and operations security (OPSEC). Thus, it is
   imperative that deployment systems and processes down to the unit level be used effectively
   and efficiently.
   2.2.4. (Added-USAFE) In USAFE-AFAFRICA, Main Operating Bases (MOB) have
   unique deployment planning challenges due to the number of different locations they must
   support outside of their installation. USAFE-AFAFRICA holds MOBs responsible for
   including annexes, Globally Separated Units (GSU), and minor installations in their
   deployment planning efforts and IDPs. This also includes USAF members located on non-
   USAFE-AFAFRICA installations and those operated by the U.S. Army, Navy, or host
   nation. For deployment planning purposes, refer to Attachment 21, identifying USAFE-
   unique MOB, Annexex, GSU, and minor installation relationships.

Section 2B—War Planning and Execution Systems

2.3. Unit Type Codes (UTC).
   2.3.1. War planners use UTCs to document total AF manpower and logistics capabilities
   needed to support the national military strategy during operational planning and execution
   activities. These requirements are documented in a JOPES/DCAPES TPFDD in support of
   an OPLAN, CONPLAN, or Operation Order (OPORD) in the form of standard UTCs.
   NOTE: IAW AFI 10-401, AFPC/DPW will work closely with commanders of limited
   supply/high demand (LS/HD) (also called limited asset availability (LAA)) resources and/or
   units to preserve near to mid-term readiness in crisis response capacity while providing
   CCDRs sufficient UTC capabilities.
   2.3.2. The MISCAP is simply a statement of the capabilities of the force identified by each
   UTC. Do not include crew ratios and monthly flying hours in UTC MISCAPs. Reference
   War Mobilization Plan, Volume 5, Basic Planning Factors & Data, for such planning data
   and factors. The UTC FAM at the MEFPAK responsible agency is responsible for writing
   the MISCAP.
   2.3.3. UTC personnel requirements are reflected in the UTC Manpower Force Packaging
   System (MANFOR).
      2.3.3.1. The AFSC/skill level/grade requirements listed in the UTC MANFOR match
      AFSC/skill level/grade of the UMD positions postured or authorized to be substituted
      according to substitution rules listed in AFI 10-401, Chapter 7.
      2.3.3.2. Substitutions of AFSC, skill level, and grade are allowed, if specifically
      referenced in the MISCAP; however, the UTC must still be able to perform its MISCAP.
      EXCEPTION: Civil Engineers (CE) are authorized to substitute positions for posturing of
      UTCs IAW substitution rules outlined in AFI 10-210, Prime Base Engineer Emergency
      Force (BEEF) Program.
      2.3.3.3. For posturing, units can fill lower skill or grade UTC requirements with a higher
      UMD skill or grade position. Such substitutions will be IAW AFI 10-244.
 70                                          AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


      2.3.3.4. Units will not be tasked to provide personnel resources for wartime and/or major
      operation and campaign requirements that exceed their UMD authorizations unless
      authorized to posture above their authorizations.
   2.3.4. UTC equipment requirements are reflected in the UTC Logistics Detail (LOGDET).
   Units must be authorized the full allowance standard of equipment as specified in the
   LOGFOR subsystem. If authorized equipment is not on hand, this must be reflected in ART.
2.4. Global Command and Control System (GCCS).
   2.4.1. GCCS is designed to improve the Joint Force Commander’s (JFCs) ability to manage
   and execute joint operations.
   2.4.2. It is the primary means of C2 for the President and SECDEF over all military forces.
   2.4.3. GCCS provides a classified global network of military and commercial
   communications systems that the JFC uses to send and obtain critical force projection
   information.
2.5. Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES).
   2.5.1. JOPES is the DOD-directed single, integrated joint command and control system for
   conventional operation planning and execution (to include theater-level nuclear and chemical
   plans).
   2.5.2. JOPES is both a process and a collection of automated systems used to develop
   OPLAN TPFDDs that drive deployment taskings.
   2.5.3. The OPLAN details the mission to be accomplished and the TPFDD contains force
   record data, including UTCs that represent unit capabilities and are the primary source for
   movement planning.
   2.5.4. The TPFDD provides a prioritized list of what combat forces, combat support, combat
   service support UTCs, as well as Individual Augmentees from Institutional Forces who
   deploy in support of a particular operation plan.
   2.5.5. It catalogs the UTCs to deploy and outlines who provides them. The TPFDD also
   identifies where they are going, how they get there, cargo dimensions, number of personnel,
   and non-organic personnel movement required.
   2.5.6. Units must maintain and report UTC information as accurately as possible to ensure
   proper forces are identified and adequate lift is planned for and provided. Reference JP 1-02,
   DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms; JP 3-35, Joint Deployment and
   Redeployment Operations; AFI 10-401; AFPD 10-4; and the CJCSM 3122-series
   publications for additional information on the use of JOPES to support deployment
   operations.
   2.5.7. The process of force projection is an integral part of JOPES. It tracks requirements,
   departures, and arrivals in the scheduling and movement subsystem of JOPES and provides
   users with an ordered and comprehensive set of procedures for resolving complex strategic
   mobility force deployment and sustainment problems. JOPES includes an operation planning
   process, an Automated Data Processing (ADP) support system, and procedures to support the
   planning process.

2.6. Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES).
   2.6.1. DCAPES is the standard AF ADP system designed to communicate OPLAN
   requirements and resource monitoring capability to minimize unnecessary movement of
   personnel and equipment into a theater of operations during execution. Additional DCAPES
   information is detailed in AFI 10-401.
   2.6.2. The objective of DCAPES is to provide improved and streamlined operations planning
   and execution processes.
   2.6.3. This includes associated policy and procedures, along with organizational and
   technology improvements.
   2.6.4. DCAPES provides standard data files, formats, application programs, and
   management procedures that are AF unique and Joint guidance compliant.
   2.6.5. DCAPES is at the heart of the AF’s War Planning and Execution System (WPES); a
   comprehensive, net-centric system of systems used in war planning and execution for the
   purpose of presenting, planning, sourcing, mobilizing, deploying, accounting for, sustaining,
   redeploying, and reconstituting AF forces; and provides a Service feed to JOPES. NOTE:
   WPES includes LOGMOD, BaS&E, LOGFAC, DCAPES, UTA, and several other war
   planning and execution systems.
   2.6.6. DCAPES and the WPES support all phases of operations planning and execution at
   the HAF, MAJCOM, NAF, and Wing/Squadron level.
   2.6.7. It is the AF’s sole capability to present, plan, source, mobilize, deploy, account for,
   sustain, redeploy, and reconstitute AF forces satisfying CCDR’s requirements.
   2.6.8. DCAPES transactions that support JOPES procedures are the mechanisms for
   submitting movement requirements to USTRANSCOM.
   2.6.9. DCAPES supports accurate and timely sourcing which includes validation and
   verification. This allows sourcing and tailoring of lower levels of detail beyond the JOPES
   level of detail.
   2.6.10. DELETED
   2.6.11. MAJCOM DCAPES/JOPES Sub-FMs will determine which of their respective
   installation/wings will be afforded write permissions to DCAPES to support verification
   responsibilities. If DCAPES is not available, installation/wing IDOs will work with
   MAJCOM FAMs and/or AEF cells for requirements.
   2.6.12. A minimum of two logistics plans manpower positions in the LRS Plans and
   Integration Section will be identified as requiring DCAPES Special Experience Identifier
   (SEI) 295. NOTE: AFRC units will ensure sufficient logistics planners assigned to the

   TPFDDs.
2.7. USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP).
   2.7.1. The USAF WMP consists of five volumes and is the USAF supporting document to
   the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP). The WMP volumes provide the Air Staff, AF
   planners, and AF commander’s current policies, planning factors, and GFM apportioned
   forces for conducting and supporting operations. A description of the WMP can be found in
   AFI 10-401, Chapter 2.
   2.7.2. Volume 3 (WMP-3), Combat and Support Forces, has four parts:
      2.7.2.1. Part 1 contains combat forces.
      2.7.2.2. Part 2 is the AF UTA which contains all postured AF UTC capability.
      2.7.2.3. Part 3 contains the AF Readiness Spares Package (RSP) authorization document.
      2.7.2.4. Part 4 is the Capability Annexes to the Air & Space Expeditionary Force
      Presence Policy.
   2.7.3. WMP-3, Part 2, UTA, is the official AF data source for identifying the availability of
   all AF UTCs.
      2.7.3.1. It contains all postured UTC capability in the AF listed by UTC/UIC/Record
      Number.
      2.7.3.2. This UTA represents the AF's commitment to support CJCS, CCDR, and
      Service-unique requirements.
      2.7.3.3. It documents all conventional and OPLAN capabilities for all Active, Guard, and
      Reserve units.
      2.7.3.4. MAJCOM MEFPAK managers will ensure assigned units, to include Reserve
      Component units, have access to WMP-3, Part 2 (UTA) data for their unit.
2.8. Logistics Module (LOGMOD).
   2.8.1. LOGMOD is a CAC-enabled web based logistics-planning program that resides on the
   AF Portal and receives and maintains the cargo and personnel details for UTCs and taskings.
   2.8.2. It maintains detailed cargo records as well as personnel records (levy file positions and
   the personnel to fill them) and provides a C2 capability through the LOGMOD Schedule.
   LOGMOD operates in unclassified mode.
   2.8.3. Currently, there is no direct interface between LOGMOD and DCAPES. LOGMOD
   is part of the WPES.
   2.8.4. There are four main LOGMOD dropdowns:
      2.8.4.1. Logistics Force Packaging Module (LOGFOR).
      2.8.4.2. Planning/Maintain Planning (LOGPLAN).
      2.8.4.3. Execution/Schedule.

   2.8.5. LOGFOR provides the capability to create and maintain the standard logistics details
   consisting of supplies and equipment for all AF UTCs that have associated supplies and
   equipment. This data is called the LOGDET. AFI 10-401 provides detailed instructions on
   adding, deleting, updating, and maintaining UTCs.
   2.8.6. LOGPLAN provides the capability to tailor or customize the plan-unique UTC
   database of equipment and supplies. It allows units to uniquely customize UTCs for each
   tasking (OPLAN/CONPLAN/AEF) that unit supports. Tailored UTC information developed
   in LOGPLAN must be manually transferred to DCAPES (air-gap process) to ensure the
   TPFDD includes correct movement requirements data. This data is called the Logistics Plan
   File (LPF).
   2.8.7. LOGMOD Schedule provides users with an automated capability to plan, schedule,
   and monitor the deployment actions that support the movement of forces.
   2.8.8. Personnel Readiness is used by the UDM in preparation for and execution of
   deployment taskings.
2.9. LOGMOD (Web based).
   2.9.1. The LOGMOD web-based program is the primary AF Deployment system. Units will
   use LOGMOD to the maximum extent possible.
   2.9.2. All feasible efforts will be exhausted during a deployment or exercise before
   converting to a backup plan for LOGMOD.
   2.9.3. Each MAJCOM is responsible for developing guidance governing back-up procedures
   when access to LOGMOD is not possible. These procedures will have to be both reliable
   and easy to maintain and include at a minimum all of the data elements from AF Forms 2511,
   2511A, and 2512.
   2.9.4. If neither LOGMOD or the MAJCOM approved back-up procedures are available,
   units will use, AF Form 2511, Deployment Schedule of Events – Cargo (refer to Attachment
   10), AF Form 2511A, Deployment Schedule of Events – Personnel (refer to Attachment 11),
   and AF Form 2512, Deployment Schedule of Events – Loading Schedule (refer to
   Attachment 9), are used for the purpose of developing and maintaining a manual deployment
   schedule.
   2.9.5. The IDO will establish a process, via the IDP, for implementing an automated backup
   deployment system when LOGMOD is unavailable or is not feasible to use for exercise or
   deployment purposes. As a non-LAN dependent system, the IDO will identify a single
   source C2 system within the DCC and IDRC to build and distribute the LOGMOD Schedule
   to UDMs, UDCCs, and deployment work centers.
2.10. Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS).
   2.10.1. DRRS is a SECDEF directed system that measures and reports on the readiness of
   military forces and the supporting infrastructure to meet missions and goals assigned by the
   SecDef. (See AFI 10-252, Defense Readiness Reporting System)
   2.10.2. DRRS draws upon established DOD and Service-specific authoritative data systems
   to establish a capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness reporting system.

Section 2C—Pre-Deployment Activities

2.19. Supported Commander.
   2.19.1. The supported commander and his or her components, along with HAF FAMs for
   Joint Sourcing Solution (JSS)/Joint Expeditionary Tasking (JET)/Individual Augmentee (IA)
   requirements, defines PDT and standards required for the safety of our members and the
   successful mission completion in their AOR.
   2.19.2. These training needs and standards ensure deploying units are aware of the CCDR's
   mission, theater support parameters and pre-positioned equipment, host nation cultural
   differences and environmental standards, mission-specific training requirements, and medical
   issues within the AOR.
   2.19.3. It is imperative that training requirements, pre-deployment activities, and standards
   be identified accurately and in a timely manner to increase the skill, rapid assimilation, and
   confidence levels of our Airmen.
2.20. Deploying Commander.
   2.20.1. With the pre-defined training and standards outlined by the supported commander,
   the responsibility for movement preparation rests with the deploying units.
   2.20.2. Preparation responsibility for Institutional Forces and assigned IMAs lies with the
   host installation to which that unit or member is assigned and/or attached IAW AFI 10-401,
   Chapter 14.
   2.20.3. Preparation for movement will be further defined in this instruction, but can include
   review of personal service records and legal documents, medical processing to include
   updating inoculations, receipt of theater-specific organizational clothing and equipment,
   theater-specific cultural or environmental protection training, warrior skills training,
   expeditionary combat skills, special training (e.g. convoy drivers), and refresher weapons
   training prior to movement.
   2.20.4. Conducting this training prior to deployment normally facilitates rapid assimilation
   and integration of arriving forces and personnel in theater.
   2.20.5. Uses the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG), AOR passenger routing instructions, and
   all applicable AOR, location specific, PDT and APOE reporting instructions provided to
   identify theater-specific personnel training and mobility equipping requirements, in order to
   prepare Airmen for deployment.
   2.20.6. AFPC’s AEF Online web site also provides guidelines for AOR reporting
   instructions via the AF Reporting Instructions Tool (AFRIT) in addition to other personnel
   readiness tools. If using the web site, commanders will ensure the reporting instructions are
   the AORs latest version available by checking with the IPR.
   2.20.7. PDT needs are also identified by the supported command via a DRMD line remark.
   A list of current line remark codes and their definitions are available on the AFPC AEF On-
   Line web site.
   2.20.8. Other pre-deployment activities could include: continued refinement of OPLANs;
   preparation of personnel and equipment for movement; preparation of ammunition, supplies,
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                        77


   and equipment; rehearsal of mission-essential tasks; conducting mission-specific training;
   establishment of sustainment requirements; and focused awareness of the impact of threat,
   climate, and geography in the AOR or Joint Operations Area (JOA) on planned joint force
   activities.
   2.20.9. Echelons. Prior to any deployment, commanders’ echelon their units based on
   operational considerations, movement schedules, and the type of lift projected. This process
   organizes and prioritizes movement within the joint force to accommodate the available lift.
   For example, the movement plan will echelon units into an advance party, main body, and
   rear party.
   2.20.10. Ensure UDMs perform a physical inspection of any/all required equipment prior to
   the departure of the deployers from home station. Further, commanders and supervisors
   alike will emphasize the importance of deploying member’s bringing and maintaining all
   required equipment to training sites (e.g. PDT - Combat Skills Training (CST), Combat
   Airman Skills Training (CAST), Evasion and Conduct After Capture (ECAC) training, etc.)
   NOTE: Regardless of whether an Airman is travelling on 1610 orders or CED orders, UDMs
   will brief Airmen that they will hand-carry AFDFs to PDT for in-processing purposes.
   2.20.11. Ensure UDMs coordinate with their respective IDO when Combat Arms limitations
   affect weapons qualification training. The IDO should contact their respective MAJCOM
   A4L/A4Rs in order to facilitate specific weapons training requirements for deploying
   Airmen. This will ensure MAJCOM A4L/A4Rs are allocating JET/IA specific weapons to
   meet Civil Affairs (CA) training requirements based on deployment tasking line remarks and
   reporting instruction directives.
   2.20.12. Basic Marksmanship (Small Arms) Training.
      2.20.12.1. UDMs will ensure personnel are scheduled for required weapons training
      IAW AOR, destination reporting instructions and associated line remarks (if any). Upon
      successful completion of weapons training, UDMs will procure the Security Forces
      Management Information System (SFMIS)-generated AF Form 522 (usually within 24-
      48 hours after live fire weapons training completion) from the deploying member.
      2.20.12.2. The UDM will review the SFMIS AF Form 522 and ensure personnel were
      trained on the required weapon(s) for their tasking and that the required Individual
      Combat Equipment (ICE) information is documented in the ‘Remarks’ block (Ref: AFI
      36-2226, Combat Arms Program). NOTE: Post the recent SFMIS AF Form 522 in the
      Airman’s AFDF.
2.21. Wing Commander (Host Installation).
   2.21.1. Responsible for every aspect of deployment planning at their installation including
   tenant units and IMAs supported by that installation’s MPS. Host Installation/Wing
   Commanders will:

  MAJCOM A4s and/or HAF FAMs to determine additional personnel, equipment and ADP
  requirements that will be required for support agreements, new Terms of Agreement (TOA),
  etc.
     2.21.7.1. (Added-USAFE) MOBs also have unique deployment planning challenges
     due to the number of USAF NATO members requiring deployment support. USAFE-
     AFAFRICA holds MOBs responsible for including USAF NATO personnel in their
     deployment planning efforts and IDPs. MOB IDOs must determine the best method to
     use when planning and executing deployment operations in regards to Annexes, GSUs,
     and minor installations. The method chosen must be documented in applicable IDPs and
     coordinated with all parties involved to ensure full understanding.

2.25. Cargo Taskings.
   2.25.1. Until LOGMOD incorporates a shortfall function for tasked cargo, initiate a reclama
   via RPT for requirements that the unit cannot fill. If for non-AEF executed taskings or when
   unit does not have access to RPT, use AFPC/DPW Manual RPT Form. Notify
   IDO/IDRC/DCC immediately. NOTE: RPT is not authorized for weapons, ammo, IE/PPE
   shortfalls; refer to MAJCOM guidance for processing these types of shortfalls.
   2.25.2. Submit the completed AFPC/DPW hard-copy reclama template within times
   established in AFI 10-401 and/or more stringent times established by the IDO in the IDP.
   2.25.3. When a cargo reclama is processed (RPT or hard-copy), the IDRC staff will look for
   suitable substitute cargo and equipment from another on-base organization.
      2.25.3.1. If suitable substitutes are available locally, submit a UIC change request via
      RPT except when use of AFPC/DPW Manual RPT Form is warranted.
      2.25.3.2. If suitable substitutes are not available locally, submit a reclama request via
      RPT except when use of AFPC/DPW Manual RPT Form is warranted.
   2.25.4. Reclama Template Classification Guidance.
      2.25.4.1. AFPC/DPW’s hard-copy reclama template is considered unclassified for
      planning and execution purposes as long as the tasked OPLAN/CONPLAN PID is not
      included. AFPC/DPW’s hard-copy reclama template is the same as the LOGMOD
      automated shortfall process, with the exception of required unit commander/UDM
      signatures, and the proper justification.

   ensure the squadron can comply with the plan and meet deployment requirements.
   2.25.7. Works with the IDO/IDRC to identify all planned taskings (e.g. contingency plans,
   UTA, base support planning responsibilities, etc.). Validates unit’s maximum simultaneous
   deployment capability. NOTE: These are accomplished during the commander’s
   training/update.
   2.25.8. DELETED
   2.25.9. Designate unit representatives (i.e. cargo couriers) to accompany equipment and
   supplies on assigned lift. If, while in-transit, equipment and supplies are bumped en route to
   the deployed location, courier(s) will be available to coordinate movement of assets on the
   next available lift.
2.26. Installation Deployment Officer (IDO).
   2.26.1. DELETED
   2.26.2. Provides oversight and executes installation/Wing deployment C2 processes to

  2.26.3. The IDO will:
     2.26.3.1. In conjunction with assigned units, determine the installation’s maximum
     simultaneous deployment capability and obtain Installation/Wing Commander approval
     annually. Maximum simultaneous deployment capability validation by squadron and
     Installation/Wing Commanders must be documented in writing, maintained in the IDRC
     /Logistics Plans and Integration Section office, and are sent to applicable MAJCOM
     A4/A4Rs for transparency.
     2.26.3.2. Develop the Installation Deployment Plan (IDP). When developing the IDP,
     the IDO will confer with the Integrated Defense Plan to de-conflict weapons e.g. arms,
     ammunition and explosives (AA&E) issuing and/or transportation procedures for
     deploying personnel.
     2.26.3.3. Brief Installation/Wing Commander and senior staff at least annually on UTCs
     assigned, the IDP, OPLANs the installation is tasked to support, projected installation
     throughput requirements by day, installation bed-down forces by day, and installation
     LIMFACs and/or shortfalls. Briefing attendance and content will be documented in
     writing and maintained by the IDRC.
     2.26.3.4. Train senior staff and squadron commanders on their responsibilities in
     deployment planning and execution.        Training attendance and content will be
     documented in writing and maintained by the IDRC.
     2.26.3.5. Determines appropriate and applicable reporting instructions, deployment
     guidance, AOR and training required.
     2.26.3.6. Provide training links to UDMs and ensuring UDMs receive the necessary
     training to manage unit deployment programs.
     2.26.3.7. Ensure all assigned UDMs complete IDO provided UDM training NLT 30-days
     after written appointment by the unit commander. NOTE: NLT 90 days for AFRC
     UDMs.
     2.26.3.8. Ensure provided training is designed to enhance UDM basic knowledge and
     skills to improve wing deployment capabilities.
     2.26.3.9. Use command level UDM training curriculum and materials provided by their
     respective MAJCOM A4L/A4Rs in order to conduct UDM classroom training.
     2.26.3.10. Include wing-level deployment planning processes (unique to the host
     installation/wing) that will not detract from command-level training curriculum and
     materials.
     2.26.3.11. Ensure training venues are available to train unit personnel to prepare unit
     equipment and assigned personnel for deployment processing requirements. The IDO
     will also ensure training venues are available to train installation/wing personnel to
     process installation equipment and personnel.
     2.26.3.12. Brief Installation/Wing Commander and senior staff monthly on discrepancies
     recorded during the previous deployment cycle. NOTE: Briefings should include
     information identified in DPDRT.
 82                                           AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


      2.26.3.13. Establish processes and procedures for the DCC and collaborates with the
      process owners of the PDF and CDF to provide efficient and effective deployment C2 for
      processing the installation/wing’s personnel and equipment.
      2.26.3.14. Monitor appropriate command and control systems (e.g. DCAPES, JOPES,
      etc.) for TPFDD taskings and to identify requirements sourced to the installation and/or
      identified to embark from the installation.
      2.26.3.15. Coordinate TPFDD requirements with IPR, LRS Traffic Management, and
      affected units.
      2.26.3.16. Ensure TPFDD routing and time phasing information is followed. The IDO
      should ensure that designated IDRC personnel (both permanent and direct support staff)
      obtain and maintain access to the Air and Space Expeditionary Force Information Service
      (AEFIS). IDRC personnel should utilize the ITV Data Change Report and TPFDD
      Reconciliation Report, within AEFIS, on a daily basis to monitor potential TPFDD
      changes (i.e. Mode/Source code, C-day, Line Remark, Tasking Status, Tasked Personnel
      Accounting System (PAS) that may impact the TPFDD routing and time phasing of
      tasked personnel and cargo from home station.
      2.26.3.17. For AEF schedule rotations, IDRC personnel will immediately identify
      TPFDD Mode/Source code and C-Day changes to the IDO to ensure LRS Passenger
      Movement Element personnel book/re-book deploying personnel, according to the
      Mode/Source code specified in the TPFDD. NOTE: AEFIS is an optional SIPRNET
      role-based application available from the secure AEF Online Portal at the following
      website: https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil.
      2.26.3.18. For AEF rotations, monitor the designated or dedicated newsgroups.

      2.26.3.22. Establish installation procedures to ensure Airmen accomplish all pre-
      deployment requirements to meet the specific FCG, AOR passenger routing and reporting
      instructions as well as all applicable location specific, PDT and APOE reporting
      instructions provided by the IPR.

Section 2D—Worst Case Scenario (WCS)

2.27. Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) Planning Factors.
   2.27.1. In military terms, WCS is a set of conditions, situations or circumstances that directly
   impact or exceed an installation/wings ability to accomplish its operational readiness and/or
   MCO requirements.
   2.27.2. In determining the WCS, the IDO, to include the IRO, must consider several factors.
   Typically, these factors identify and account for the installation/wings single most stringent
   deployment, reception/throughput, and bed-down support requirements e.g. pre-identified
   TPFDD personnel and cargo movement requirements, available installation infrastructure,
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                          83


   facilities, and MHE authorizations. These items are assessed against the installation/wing’s
   resources, capabilities and processes to help determine the installation/wing’s LIMFACs.
       2.27.2.1. The process begins with the IDO along with the IRO reviewing all applicable
       operations/contingency plans that their installation is tasked to support (UTA Posturing
       Codes (P-Coding), DOC statements, all force’s TPFDDs, home station mission
       requirements, possible installation through-put, etc.), or as identified by each MAJCOM
       A4/A4R.
       2.27.2.2. Once determined, the IDO and IRO will conduct a combined DPWG and
       RPWG meeting with all deployment and reception work center personnel from the
       DCC/RCC, CDF/CRF, and PDF/RPU, in order to revise the IDP by denoting the
       installations process and procedures for orchestrating an installation/wing’s WCS.
       2.27.2.3. The IDO and IRO will formally document the installation’s WCS and provide a
       briefing to key senior leadership annually.
       2.27.2.4. Table 2.1 identifies the primary factors to be reviewed, in determining the
       installation/wing’s WCS (i.e. single most stringent contingency plan).

Table 2.1. Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) Planning Factors
Total number of deployable personnel.
Total number of deployable short tons.
Total number of transiting personnel.
Total number of transiting short tons.
Total number of inbound personnel.
Total number of inbound short tons.
Maximum on Ground (MOG): Using the transient or inbound aircraft types identified in the
USAF War and Mobilization (WMP), Volume 4 (WMP – Wartime Aircraft Activity Report
(WAAR)), it is necessary to review the airfield throughput capability associated to a contingency
plan, to determine if existing airfield capacities will limit a planned operation. For initial
planning purposes, enroute locations will be assumed to have a higher airfield throughput
capability than the on/off-load locations. Parking and working MOG can be two different
numbers with two significantly different meanings. Example: an installation will be able to park
(10) wide-body aircraft at one-time, but will only have sufficient personnel and MHE to on/off-
load (2) wide-body aircraft. The more restrictive MOG equates to the WCS.

     2.27.2.5. Much of the source data required to determine WCSs come from the following
     systems and/or applications:
  2.27.3. The War Mobilization Plan, Volume 3 (WMP-3) identifies apportioned forces and
  contains the UTA listing all postured UTCs.
  2.27.4. The WMP, Volume 4, Wartime Aircraft Activity (WMP-4), contains the Wartime
  Aircraft Activity Report (WAAR) depicting aircraft activity aligned against OPLANs and
  some CONPLANs with TPFDDs. The WMP-4 also includes the Wartime Consumables
  Distribution Objective (WCDO), which planners can use to approximate maximum support
  of aircraft activity (e.g. working MOG). Planners can get to the WAAR and the WCDO
  from the Logistics Feasibility Analysis Capability (LOGFAC) System.
  2.27.5. Force flow data for deploying, transiting, and inbound forces can be accessed via the
  TPFDD. Planners will use JOPES or DCAPES to query the TPFDDs their wing units are
  tasked under.
  2.27.6. The local BSP or ESP will identify wartime facility and infrastructure capacity,
  capability, ownership, and use. This data can be accessed through BaS&E Planning Tool.
  The Civil Engineer Squadron (CES) also hosts the Facility Management Board that allocates
  facility use. Airfield Managers work with CES and Wing Safety to develop aircraft parking
  plans.
  2.27.7. The AF Equipment Management System (AFEMS) and Standard Base Supply
  System (SBSS) will provide WRM equipment listing (based on WRM UTCs from the UTA)
  and Custodian Authorization/Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) for equipment and vehicle
  authorizations and on-hand numbers.
  2.27.8. The Inventory Management Plan (IMP) will detail fuels storage capacity and
  requirements.
  2.27.9. At the start of each global AEF schedule, unit commanders will ensure sufficient
  numbers and types of Airmen are associated to support the unit’s postured and aligned UTCs.
  In the case of the Institutional Forces, host installations will add these forces and assigned
  IMA numbers to their WCS (at the Installation/Wing Commander discretion) through
  historical deployment data analysis. This will ensure an appropriate number of personnel are
  identified for each AEF vulnerability period in order to accurately determine sourcing
  solutions.
  2.27.10. Taking these and other factors into account, the IDO and functional planners can
  start to estimate maximum requirements for facilities, equipment, vehicles, and personnel to
  support contingency/deployment operations.
     2.27.10.1. Knowledge of the high volume days bounds the upper support limit (i.e.
     largest processing center required, most number of support vehicles needed, greatest
     amount of support personnel to train, etc.).
     2.27.10.2. Total quantities assist in determining number of mobility bags and training
     capacity (instructors, facilities, equipment/supplies).
     2.27.10.3. Other factors include weather/climate and home station location with
     associated risk.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                           85


2.28. Deployment Taskings.
   2.28.1. The IDO will establish procedures to identify, accept, validate and verify all assigned
   taskings for host, assigned tenants, and GSUs to which the installation/wing is assigned as
   the servicing MPF.
   2.28.2. IDOs at host installations having servicing MPF responsibilities for active-duty
   components of Total Force Integrated (TFI) units will identify, accept, validate and verify
   taskings on their behalf.
   2.28.3. The IDO and base units tasked to support an OPLAN or CONPLAN will be familiar
   with the plan’s concept of operations, basic plan, and the tasking. EXCEPTION: AFPC will
   initiate verification for all organizations considered “outside” the Air Force (see AFI 10-401,
   Table A8.3) and will provide documentation of approval from OSD/A&M to the servicing
   IDRC.
   2.28.4. In addition to contingency planning taskings (OPLANs/CONPLANs), the IDO will
   identify UTCs postured in the UTA for all units.
   2.28.5. The IDO will review installation taskings with planners, unit commanders and
   UDMs to validate posturing, AEF alignment/banding, UTC P-Coding, MISCAP statements,
   shortfalls/mitigation strategies, and ART reports.
   2.28.6. Deficiencies are identified and reported to appropriate MAJCOM FAMs.
   2.28.7. MAJCOM/NGB FAMs, working with unit commanders and following Air Staff
   FAM guidance, posture units by entering a UTC for that specific UIC into the UTA.
      2.28.7.1. Multiple occurrences of a UTC for a unit will have a separate Availability Line
      Number (ALN).
      2.28.7.2. MAJCOM FAMs, unit commanders, and UDMs must ensure the maximum
      numbers of funded authorizations assigned to the UMD are postured in standard UTCs.
      2.28.7.3. Any residual deployable authorizations not in standard UTCs are postured into
      associate UTCs (A-UTCs).
      2.28.7.4. Commanders and UDMs must ensure that Air Force manning positions are not
      assigned to more than one UTC record.
   2.28.8. After validating all postured positions, unit commanders, UDMs, IDOs and planners
   will check the P-Coding of postured UTC records and subsequent AEF alignment.
      2.28.8.1. P-Codes, when taken in concert with ART and manning, indicates the
      availability of UTCs. UTCs are aligned IAW HAF FAM (as supplemented by MAJCOM
      FAM) guidance and AFI 10-401, Chapter 7.
      2.28.8.2. Installation/Wing Commanders are expected to place this guidance in their
      respective base support plans to expressly articulate mitigating factors and risks while
      appropriately coding capabilities required for home station and aligning the maximum
      amount of capability available to CCDRs.
   2.28.9. After assessing UTC posturing, AEF alignment, and planned AEF Taskings, the IDO
   and planning community can determine an installation’s maximum simultaneous deployment
   capability (maximum number of personnel and equipment that can be deployed
 86                                         AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


   simultaneously during maximum surge operations) by comparing current manning to the
   units assigned/committed and AF requirements.
      2.28.9.1. All UTA records that are “Home station Requirements” are coded DX and
      Home Station missions that directly supports a Combatant Commander’s mission or are
      deployed within the assigned theater are coded DP. All others are DW coded.
      2.28.9.2. The maximum simultaneous deployment capability will be the total number of
      DW coded UTCs across all AEF banding assignments the installation is aligned against.
      2.28.9.3. DELETED
   2.28.10. Location/Risk Assessment.
      2.28.10.1. An installation in Korea will probably have a robust “fight in-place”
      requirement and will receive/beddown forces versus a large deployment commitment.
      This type of forward operating site would have to consider:
          2.28.10.1.1. Storage and distribution of CBRN IPE assets, NEO, pre-positioned
          material, contingency contracts, and HNS.
          2.28.10.1.2. Purchase, storage, and maintenance of a large quantity of IPE due to the
          high-risk location.
          2.28.10.1.3. Capacity to off-load, process, transport, and/or beddown incoming
          forces/additional personnel.
          2.28.10.1.4. Evacuate of non-combatants.
          2.28.10.1.5. Some of the risk will be mitigated with pre-positioned materiel,
          contingency contracts, and host-nation support.
      2.28.10.2. On the opposite end of the location and risk spectrum, an AF Space Command
      (AFSPC) unit in Colorado may also “fight in-place.” An “inplace unit” would have to
      consider:
          2.28.10.2.1. The fact that as a low-risk locale the unit wouldn't expect to receive
          additional personnel. So while the units in Korea and Colorado may have similar
          numbers of DW, AW, DP, and/or AP counters, their planning requirements could be
          completely dissimilar.
      2.28.10.3. As such, even though functional planners, unit personnel, and the IDO
      estimate the WCS, final estimated requirements must be agreed to by Group
      Commanders and signed by the Installation/Wing Commander. These requirements are
      reviewed annually.
2.29. Individual Protective Equipment (IPE).
   2.29.1. Requirements. IDOs will analyze and determine deployment bag and IPE
   requirements at least annually NLT 1 January.
      2.29.1.1. Requirements will be based on the total number of DW-coded UTCs in UTA
      for that installation/wing (J-suffix coded UTCs may not have the same requirements
      unless directed by the owning command).
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                       87


     2.29.1.2. For locations in medium threat areas (MTA) or high threat areas (HTA),
     planners will use formulas as prescribed in 23-series AFIs to meet home station
     protective requirements in addition to deployment requirements.
     2.29.1.3. There may be circumstances where the requirement is greater than the
     maximum simultaneous deployment capability (e.g. at overseas installations where non-
     deployable personnel may be stationed in the AOR and require protective equipment at
     home station). The IDO will consult with the, LRS Plans and Integration Section (WRM
     Element), CES Readiness and Emergency Management, and the Medical Group to
     determine the installation’s total requirement. Refer to AFI 10-2501 and AFMAN 23-
     110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 26, for determining CBRN and IPE content and
     requirements, respectively.

  2.29.3. Insect Vector Control Measures. Units/installations will maintain adequate stocks of
  DEET, Permethrin, and insect bed nets and poles to meet their maximum simultaneous
  deployment capability.
  2.29.4. IDOs, LRS IPE Section and units will consult AOR reporting instructions, OPLANs/
  CONPLANs, AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 26, Attachment 26, F-4, Individual
  Mobility Equipment Requirements, for more details on requirements, quantities, procurement,
  storage, maintenance, and shelf-life issues.
  2.29.5. Procurement and Storage. While the IDO, CE Readiness and Emergency
  Management, and the LRS/CC determines quantities required for deployment bags, the
  procurement, storage, and management responsibilities vary.
     2.29.5.1. A- and B-Bags are purchased with base Operations & Maintenance (O&M)
     funds as outlined in AFMAN 23-110.
     2.29.5.2. C-Bag funding requirements determination and components are identified in

     2.29.5.6. Inventory and shelf-life control of deployment bags will be maintained in
     MICAS by the storing organization. The storing unit is also responsible for inspection,
     repair, and replacement. See AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 2, Part 2, Chapter 26, for more on

2.30. Weapons and Ammunition.
   2.30.1. The IDO will determine the number of small arms/light weapons required to support
   an installation's maximum simultaneous deployment capability on an annual basis.
   2.30.2. The IDO, in coordination with the Munitions Accountable Systems Officer (MASO),
   will use AFI 21-201 to determine the authorized quantities of ammunition to be stocked and
   stored on the installation to support deployment capability on an annual basis.
   2.30.3. MAJCOMs will provide guidance for requirements computation and coordination
   such as in the case of Institutional Forces.
   2.30.4. As noted in AFI 31-207, commanders may arm deployable forces to support
   contingency, wartime, or training operations.
      2.30.4.1. IDOs and units will consult OPLANs and CONPLANs that the installation is
      tasked to support for specifics describing the type of small arms/light weapons required,
      the arming mission, the anticipated tasks armed members will perform, and the command
      and control elements.
      2.30.4.2. Tasking messages (or reporting instructions) will also describe arming
      requirements for current operations.
   2.30.5. As a minimum, the number of weapons required will be determined by summing all
   the DW and AW counters within a unit.
      2.30.5.1. J-suffix coded UTCs may not be required to have small arms/light weapons
      unless directed by the owning command.
      2.30.5.2. IDOs and units will consult AFCAT 21-209 Volume 1, Chapter 3, and AFI 21-
      201 to determine ammunition quantities authorized to be stocked and stored at the base to
      support deployment requirements.
      2.30.5.3. Unit commanders are responsible for the procurement, establishment of
      accounts, documentation, transportation and maintenance of weapons and ammunition
      IAW AFI 21-201.
      2.30.5.4. (Added-USAFE) In USAFE-AFAFRICA, designated aggregation bases
      (Aviano, Mildenhall, Spangdahlem, and Ramstein) will include a 5% overage to their
      minimum number of weapons required. This will accommodate short notice taskings
      from origins with difficulties moving weapons without proper lead time. Aggregation
      bases must document issue, receipt, and turn-in procedures in their IDPs or installation
      reporting instructions.
2.31. Medical Requirements.
   2.31.1. The Medical Group, with the IDO’s assistance, will develop a process to ensure
   deploying personnel receive pre-deployment medical threat/countermeasure briefing and
   complete all pre-deployment medical requirements. Medical deployment requirements are
   outlined in Attachment 20.

Section 2E—Installation Deployment Plan (IDP)

2.32. Installation Deployment Plan (IDP) development.
   2.32.1. The host Installation/Wing Commander, through the IDP, defines local processes,
   procedures, infrastructure, and resources used to deploy forces.
      2.32.1.1. The IDO develops the IDP for the host Installation/Wing Commander.
      2.32.1.2. The IDO must analyze inputs from all assigned or attached units (including
      collocated, GSU, tenant, Institutional, and transient units) and develop local operations
      guidance on how units will deploy from the installation. Include processes for executing
      all contingencies, exercises, and other deployments.
      2.32.1.3. (Added-USAFE) The creation of an IDP is mandatory at all USAFE-
      AFAFRICA MOBs (Aviano, Incirlik, Lakenheath, Mildenhall, Spangdahlem, and
      Ramstein). IDPs must include deployment planning and execution procedures and
      processes for assigned GSUs, remote sites or other isolated areas, and NATO supported
      personnel within the USAFE-AFAFRICA AOR.
   2.32.2. The IDP must describe who, what, when, where, and how the installation meets each
   basic deployment requirement.
   2.32.3. As the deployment process owner, the host Installation/Wing Commander must
   ensure the IDO and the deployment planning and execution community are in step with his
   or her direction.
   2.32.4. The IDO/IRO will conduct an annual IDP briefing to the host Installation/Wing
   Commander and senior staff in order to review the status of the IDP and all requirements as
   listed in Attachment 12. Briefing attendance and content will be documented in writing and
   maintained by the IDO.
   2.32.5. The IDO will analyze all applicable planning documents to ensure the IDP addresses
   the full range of military operations the installation is identified to support.
      2.32.5.1. DELETED

     2.32.5.2. DELETED
     2.32.5.3. IDPs for forward presence forces should include HN resources available to
     successfully execute deployment and redeployment operations.
         2.32.5.3.1. HN agreements, such as status-of-forces agreements and multinational
         and/or bilateral agreements negotiated before crisis situations arise facilitate needed
         access to HN resources.
         2.32.5.3.2. HNs may provide a variety of services through their national agencies in
         support of deployment and redeployment execution.
  2.32.6. To mitigate risk, the IDP will continually consider ORM throughout the deployment
  planning and execution process, taking advantage of the expertise at their local safety offices
  and the tools and techniques contained in publications.
     2.32.6.1. The IDO, in coordination with the Wing Anti-Terrorism Officer (ATO) and
     Threat Working Group (TWG), will determine if there is an increased threat to, and the
     criticality of, mass forces staging for deployment(s). This is to ensure the IDP identifies
     any/all necessary AT capabilities and resources IAW AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism, and AFI
     31-101, Integrated Defense, as appropriate in terms of air, space and information
     operations, plans and requirements.
     2.32.6.2. Proper FP flexibility is necessary to ensure the ability to meet minimum DOD
     and AF AT Program requirements in order to properly manage higher AT program risks.
  2.32.7. Once the maximum simultaneous deployment capability is documented, preparation
  or modification of facilities can occur, personnel training will be required, acquiring
  appropriate equipment will begin, and creation or adjustments to processes will be practiced
  and codified.
  2.32.8. As a minimum, the IDP must address the following areas:
     2.32.8.1. Deployment roles and responsibilities
     2.32.8.2. Pre-execution procedures
     2.32.8.3. Deployment work-center organization and facilities
     2.32.8.4. Unit personnel and equipment assembly areas
     2.32.8.5. Cargo marshaling yards
     2.32.8.6. Installation-level passenger and cargo processing facilities/locations
     2.32.8.7. Execution procedures
     2.32.8.8. Weapons and ground safety concerns (including ORM mitigation procedures)
     2.32.8.9. Deployment training requirements
     2.32.8.10. Deployment process flowcharts
     2.32.8.11. Pre-processing procedures.
  2.32.9. The IDP must clearly define:
     2.32.9.1. Processes for individual issue and mass issue of mobility bags
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                          91


     2.32.9.2. IPE
     2.32.9.3. Weapons and ammunition
     2.32.9.4. Storage, inventory, and maintenance responsibilities for mobility bags,
     weapons, ammunition, insect vector control measures (e.g. DEET), and first aid kit
     requirements.
     2.32.9.5. (Added-USAFE) The IDP will outline the process for ensuring proper
     weapons handling and storage requirements for USAFE-AFAFRICA originating
     passengers when authorized leave in conjunction with CONUS based training prior to
     deployment.
         2.32.9.5.1. (Added-USAFE) The IDP will outline the process for ensuring proper
         weapons handling and storage requirement for transient passengers.
  2.32.10. The IDP will identify how the wing will:
     2.32.10.1. Use all components of IDS, to include a backup process when IDS is
     unavailable. These procedures will address timelines and receipt/production of personnel
     and cargo files for manifesting, ICODES files for load planning, LOGMOD and
     CMOS/GATES interfaces for ITV, and RFID tag requirements.
     2.32.10.2. Include and identify procedures associated with file transfer activities when
     the location serves as an “AGGREGATION BASE/HUB” in the AEF rotation.
     2.32.10.3. Use Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) designated aggregation locations
     X-MAN file procedures in lieu of requesting or expecting CMOS (*.PAX) files from
     multiple locations. Correct X-MAN file format can be found at the AMC/A4T portal
     page                                                   (https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
     af/USAF/AFP40/d/1074111948/Files/a4t/a4ti/itvinfo/hello.html). X-MAN provides
     IDOs the greatest flexibility to collect, manage and account for inbound personnel
     arriving at their designated aggregation base.
     2.32.10.4. Use normal IDS file transfer procedures when units are deploying directly
     from home station to the AOR FOL.
  2.32.11. The IDP must:
  2.32.12. Identify how the installation, to include tenants, Institutional Forces, and associate
  units, will work within the AEF construct. It must also answer force projection related
  questions such as:
     2.32.12.1. How taskings are received.
     2.32.12.2. Who receives the tasking.
     2.32.12.3. Who is notified.
     2.32.12.4. How taskings are validated.
     2.32.12.5. Validation timelines.
     2.32.12.6. Sourcing and shortfalls
     2.32.12.7. How shortfalls are processed (Refer to Attachment 4 for typical process
     flowcharts).

   2.32.13. The IDP will reflect mass and individual processing procedures. It will include
   interface procedures to receive, process, and deploy individuals and independent units
   departing by airlift or surface to an APOE or from the installation when designated an
   aggregate APOE.
   2.32.14. IDP minimum contents are specified in Attachment 13.
   2.32.15. The IDO, as a minimum, will revise the IDP every 4 years IAW AFI 33-360.
   2.32.16. Additionally, IDOs will revise the IDP within 6 months after any of the following:
      2.32.16.1. Activation of a new unit with a deployment commitment.
      2.32.16.2. A major change in manpower or equipment authorizations that result in
      changes to installation deployment policy or processes.
      2.32.16.3. A unit move or Mission Design System (MDS) change by a tenant or
      subordinate unit.
      2.32.16.4. Receipt of newly published deployment guidance or changes from AF/A4LX.
      2.32.16.5. A significant change to the installation’s deployment processes and/or
      procedures.
   2.32.17. The IDP must identify process and physical choke points and provide guidance on
   how to eliminate them or reduce the impact of them on deployment operations.
   2.32.18. Tenant units will deploy IAW host IDP. The host IDO determines specific support
   requirements based on tenant unit requirements, taskings and available resources.
   2.32.19. (Added-USAFE) See reference 2.2.5 and 2.2.5.1 for IDP development for:
   NATO, GSUs, and minor installations.

Section 2F—Logistics Plans Development and Management

2.33. Integrated Deployment System (IDS).
   2.33.1. Preparation for deployment includes tailoring, task organizing, and echeloning forces
   and materiel for deployment as well as documenting the sequence of deployment and
   movement requirements on the appropriate TPFDD.
   2.33.2. IDS is the AF system for task organizing, tailoring/echeloning forces and materiel,
   and sequencing movement requirements.
      2.33.2.1. The use of IDS is mandatory for all deployments.
      2.33.2.2. IDS is the automated family of systems used for wing-level deployments and
      contingency operations.
      2.33.2.3. IDS includes the following: LOGMOD, DCAPES, CMOS, GATES and
      ICODES.
   2.33.3. Deploying unit cargo information is consolidated in LOGMOD and passed via file
   transfer to CMOS/GATES by the Plans and Integration Section within the IDRC/DCC to
   provide ITV to IGC.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                        93


  2.33.4. Deploying passenger information is consolidated in LOGMOD and passed via file
  transfer to DCAPES and subsequently to CMOS/GATES to provide ITV.
     2.33.4.1. EXCEPTION: Institutional Forces, Outside the AF, and extended deployments
     – formerly known as Intermediate TDY (ITDY) taskings, are received from AFPC with
     the name already in system; consolidating passenger data in LOGMOD of attached or
     supported Institutional Forces outside of the Host’s organizational structure is not
     required.
     2.33.4.2. IDS passenger manifests are not required for commercially ticketed passengers.
  2.33.5. Failure to use the full capabilities of IDS hinders an installation/wing’s ability to
  achieve timely ITV and will reduce CCDR’s visibility to track force closure.
  2.33.6. The IDO will direct Logistics Plans and Manpower offices to develop LOGMOD
  and DCAPES planning files for use in the IDS as required.
  2.33.7. The installation/wing IPR uses DCAPES to maintain the Personnel Information File
  (PIF), personnel assignments, and execution deployment requirements. IPR will provide a
  personnel refresh file (*PRF.) to the Plans and Integration Section on a weekly basis, for
  import into LOGMOD, to ensure accurate visibility of unit assigned personnel.
  2.33.8. At a minimum, the LOGMOD Administrator will develop and maintain the
  following LOGPLAN files (in LOGMOD) to support contingency and crisis action planning
  movement of UTC cargo.
     2.33.8.1. A master LOGPLAN file containing all UTCs listed as available for tasking as
     reflected in UTA.
         2.33.8.1.1. Multiple copies of the same UTC is not required.
         2.33.8.1.2. The master LOGPLAN file will consist of the standard LOGDET for
         every cargo UTC postured against the installation.
         2.33.8.1.3. UTCs will not be tailored to deviate from the standard UTC LOGDET
         established by the Pilot Unit. However, these UTCs must be modified by the
         appropriate UDMs and/or Unit Cargo Increment Monitors to identify LRS validated
         suitable substitute National Stock Numbers (NSN), actual weights and dimensional
         data (LxWxH), accurate Load Planning Data (LPD) and DD Form 1384,
         Transportation Control and Movement Document, (TCMD) are completed and unit
         commander have coordinated/approved increment movement priorities.
     2.33.8.2. A separate LOGPLAN file for each AEF rotation, OPLAN, or CONPLAN
     upon receipt of an execution tasking received and validated by the IDO/IDRC via
     DCAPES.
         2.33.8.2.1. LOGPLAN execution files will be created by copying existing cargo
         UTC information contained within the master LOGPLAN file.
         2.33.8.2.2. UTCs will be tailored by UDMs and/or Unit Cargo Increment Monitors
         based on CCDR documentation denoting pre-positioned UTC cargo for use by the
         unit upon arrival and MAJCOM FAM approval.
94                                        AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


        2.33.8.2.3. Each AEF File must be developed using an AF approved Pseudo Plan ID
        (PID). MAJCOM A4s will provide their installations with command unique Pseudo
        PIDs where there is no AF approved Pseudo PID.
     2.33.8.3. DELETED
  2.33.9. OPLAN and Pseudo PIDs.
     2.33.9.1. Units will maintain deployment planning data unique to their unit UTC tasking
     in the LOGPLAN module of LOGMOD.
     2.33.9.2. Individual LOGPLAN PIDs will be created for each tasked OPLAN with a
     maintained TPFDD, CONPLAN with TPFDD, UTC Availability, and/or notional tasking
     such as an AEF.
     2.33.9.3. Units will use only HAF approved Pseudo PIDs in LOGPLAN in lieu of actual
     OPLAN PIDs for contingency planning to minimize the risk of classifying LOGMOD.
     2.33.9.4. Units tasked under specific OPLANs will build each LOGPLAN PID using an
     approved corresponding AF-approved Pseudo PID (EXAMPLE: WOT**).
     2.33.9.5. In the Schedule module of LOGMOD, units will maintain the same
     corresponding information.
     2.33.9.6. A list of AF-approved Pseudo PIDs will be obtained from the MAJCOM
     LOGMOD Manager or downloaded from AF/A5XW SIPR Webpage.
     2.33.9.7. Specific instructions regarding the passing of data from the LOGMOD
     Schedules are identified in Attachment 8. NOTE: Use proper OPSEC procedures and
     exercise caution when associating Pseudo PIDs to real-world PIDs as it could cause a
     real-world security violation resulting in cascading affects.
     2.33.9.8. Under no circumstances will units classify their LOGMOD database by loading
     actual classified PIDs or Plan Titles in LOGMOD (LOGPLAN or LOGMOD Schedule).
     2.33.9.9. Avoid identifying the AOR or exact location, geographical location (GEOLOC)
     code, and/or International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code for deployments in
     the LOGMOD Schedule ID Title or Destination Data Field of the LOGMOD Schedule
     ID Header Record. Guidance on JOPES data element classifications can be found in
     CJCSM 3122.01, Joint Operation Planning and Execution System Volume I (Planning
     Policies and Procedures) and CJCSM 3150.16b, Volume 2, Joint Planning and Execution
     System Reporting Structure (JOPESREP).
  2.33.10. The starting point for determining deploying unit equipment is the standard
  LOGDET found in LOGFOR. The LRS Plans and Integration Section will copy UTCs from
  LOGFOR into LOGPLAN to build LOGPLAN PIDs.
     2.33.10.1. On a semi-annual basis, LOGMOD Administrators will:
        2.33.10.1.1. Conduct a review of all contingency and crisis action planning UTCs (in
        LOGMOD) to ensure their UDMs have updated their respective UTCs to accurately
        reflect:
            2.33.10.1.1.1. Deployment Echelon Codes (see AFI 10-401).
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                         95


            2.33.10.1.1.2. Increment Numbers (refer to LOGFOR UTC).

            2.33.10.1.1.9. NSNs (see DLA FLIS website).
        2.33.10.1.2. Will ensure all UTC increments of cargo depict a movement priority
        code IAW contingency load plans.
        2.33.10.1.3. Notify UDMs, in writing, of deficient UTC data and advised to take
        immediate corrective actions to update their UTC data within 4-duty days of
        notification.
  2.33.11. Tailoring UTC Logistics Detail in LOGPLAN.
     2.33.11.1. Tailoring is the process by which base-level units make a generic capability fit
     a specific purpose, region, supported or supporting command instruction.
     2.33.11.2. MAJCOM FAMs are the approval authority for any significant tailoring
     action such as addition or deletion of UTC personnel and/or mobility equipment that will
     otherwise impact the overall mission or movement of a UTC.
     2.33.11.3. Tailoring must either be directed by the MAJCOM FAM in writing or based
     on an approved planning document (OPLAN/CONPLAN TPFDD, AEF
     planning/execution conference, Expeditionary Site Plans (ESP), Exercise Support Plans,
     Site Surveys, etc.).
        2.33.11.3.1. Tailoring out cargo is permitted if authoritative documents reflect
        deploying/ required assets are in-place and available at the deployed location for the
        deploying units use such as pre-positioned WRM UTCs or assets identified in other
        WRM authorization documents (WCDO, ESP, and/or OPLAN TPFDDs).
        2.33.11.3.2. Tailored weights will be based on the gross incremental weight of each
        item and adjusted in the appropriate TPFDD. Units will tailor their LOGPLAN UTCs
        by adding, deleting, and modifying applicable increments, items, and suffix items.
        2.33.11.3.3. AEF lead wings in collaboration with supporting wings/units will use
        LOGMOD’s LOGPLAN Module to tailor equipment for AEF deployments.
        LOGPLAN files can be easily passed to the lead wing, the wing/units currently
        deployed, and to the various supporting wings to assist in the collaborative process to
        ensure the right capability is provided at the right time in the right way to meet the
        mission and to refine/reduce the deployment footprint.
        2.33.11.3.4. Tailoring must not change the mission capability of a UTC as described
        in the UTC MISCAP.
96                                           AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


     2.33.11.4. Adding equipment items to LOGPLAN is prohibited unless the item has been
     added to the standard UTC by its Pilot Unit and approved by the HAF FAM and
     LOGDET Manager for that UTC or is contained in an approved Allowance Standard
     (AS) for that UTC.
        2.33.11.4.1. For CE, no equipment item can be added to a standard UTC unless it is
        identified on the Equipment and Supply List (ESL) as well as contained in applicable
        AS.
        2.33.11.4.2. Deployable equipment items added to a UTC are considered Use Code
        “A” as reflected in an AS by an Allowance Source Code (ASC).
        2.33.11.4.3. Non-equipment items may be added to LOGPLAN if they are required
        to directly support the mission specified in the MISCAP for the UTC.
     2.33.11.5. Tailoring must not cause the gross movement weight of the LOGPLAN UTC
     to exceed the standard LOGFOR UTC. USTRANSCOM and AMC currently plan airlift
     requirements based on the standard LOGFOR UTC weight and cube reported to JOPES.
     2.33.11.6. If units bulk-ship small arms weapons, small arms ammunition,
     deployment/mobility bags and expendables, then they may add these weights to the
     LOGPLAN file.
        2.33.11.6.1. Do not count the weight of these items against the UTC when comparing
        the gross transportation weight to the LOGFOR UTC.
        2.33.11.6.2. Report these differences in the respective TPFDD during crisis action
        planning when importing unit LOGPLAN/LOGMOD Schedule files into DCAPES.
     2.33.11.7. Make every effort to bulk ship mobility bags and weapons.
        2.33.11.7.1. Units will also determine if pre-deployed weapons, ammunition, and
        mobility bags that are centrally managed and distributed within certain AORs at
        Expeditionary Theater Distribution Centers (ETDC) during their tailoring efforts.
        2.33.11.7.2. Units may only tailor out these assets when the planning documents
        and/or theater directives make it clear that these assets are available for a specific unit
        or UTC’s use.
     2.33.11.8. On a semi-annual basis, LOGMOD Administrators will compare all
     LOGPLAN UTC weights (in all LOGMOD planning and execution PIDs) against the
     approved LOGFOR UTC weight to ensure unit paring and tailoring has not exceeded the
     gross movement weight of the approved LOGFOR UTC.
        2.33.11.8.1. This review will be documented, signed by the IDO, maintained in the
        LRS Plans and Integration Section, and a copy of the results provided to the
        applicable MAJCOM LOGDET Manager(s).
        2.33.11.8.2. See Attachment 8 for unit-level UTC reporting process.
     2.33.11.9. If there is a requirement to exceed standard UTC equipment weights, the
     MAJCOM A4Rs must contact the supported commander to ensure the additional weight
     is accounted for before validation occurs between supported commander and
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                           97


       USTRANSCOM. This should only occur in unique circumstances such as environmental
       requirements (i.e. additional AGE requirements) or other such factors.
       2.33.11.10. Units will maintain documentation (memo for record) on equipment that has
       been tailored (added or deleted) from their LOGPLAN UTCs for historical and
       compliance inspection purposes until UTCs have been officially changed IAW AFI 10-
       401, Chapter 5.
          2.33.11.10.1. Units will provide Logistics Planners in the LRS Plans and Integration
          Section copies of all documentation.
          2.33.11.10.2. If non-pilot units have to add items to their LOGPLAN UTC(s) in
          order to meet mission requirements, the pilot unit and MAJCOM FAM will be
          notified in case a change to the LOGDET is required for all like units.
2.34. Pre-Planned Load Plans.
   2.34.1. Preparation of pre-planned load plans is highly recommended to expedite initial
   deployment operations.
   2.34.2. Pre-planned load plans should be accomplished in ICODES using C-17s as the
   standard planning aircraft.
       2.34.2.1. (Added-USAFE) The deploying unit’s anticipated initial deployment package
       must be segmented and built to be air transportable on any potential air force transport
       aircraft. This includes C-5, C-17, C-130, KC-135 and KC-10 aircraft.
   2.34.3. Pre-planned load plans should be based on a prioritized flow of personnel and
   equipment needed to generate and provide immediate AF combat and/or support capability
   upon arrival at the deployed location.
       2.34.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Pre-load plans are required for USAFE-AFAFRICA units
       and will be maintained strictly at the prerogative of the IDO. All pre-load plans will be
       forwarded to HQ USAFE-AFAFRICA/A4RTO to include: Unit Line Numbers (ULN),
       Hazardous Diplomatic Clearance (HAZDIP), and short tons. This requirement will be
       included in Wings’ IDPs.

2.35. Cargo Prioritization.
   2.35.1. Echeloning is organizing units for movement.
       2.35.1.1. It is a pre-deployment activity that establishes a priority for movement within a
       capability (UTC), unit, or wing.
       2.35.1.2. Proper sequencing of forces into the AOR and/or JOA promotes the rapid
       buildup of capabilities that permit the supported CCDR to seize the initiative and conduct
       successful decisive operations as early as possible.
   2.35.2. Units will maintain LOGPLAN files for their tasked OPLANs/CONPLANs. The
   OPLAN/CONPLAN TPFDD priority flow must be reflected in each LOGPLAN PID.
98                                         AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


     2.35.2.1. Units will prioritize the out-movement of equipment using both Deployment
     Echelon codes (See JCS Pub 6, Volume V, Part 4; AFI 10-401; MEFPAK; LOGMOD
     System Help files; and LOGMOD Users Guide) and the Movement Priority fields in
     LOGPLAN.
     2.35.2.2. Use Deployment Echelon codes in contingency planning and use movement
     priority fields during crisis action to reflect changing requirements at execution. These
     are mandatory entries in LOGPLAN that improve connectivity between LOGMOD and
     other IDS components.
     2.35.2.3. TCMD/ICODES data is required for LOGPLAN files.
  2.35.3. Deployment echelon codes and increment numbers identified in the LOGPLAN
  standard UTCs will not be modified without written authorization from the MAJCOM FAM
  or HHQ approval.
     2.35.3.1. Standard UTCs are developed based on the UTC MISCAP, weapon/non-
     weapon system AS, 30-day sustainment, re-supply at 31+ days and a bare-base (austere)
     environment.
     2.35.3.2. Cargo movement prioritization will reflect the minimum equipment needed to
     regenerate/weapons load aircraft (for aviation UTCs) and/or establish base operations
     (i.e. FP, rapid runway repair, communications, lodging/food preparations, etc.) to be
     deployed on the first available support airlift to Forward Operating Locations (FOL).
     2.35.3.3. Pilot units prioritize the out-movement of equipment using deployment
     echelons and increment numbers. Refer to AFI 10-401 for additional information on
     UTC development.
     2.35.3.4. If non-pilot units have differing opinions as to what equipment will be
     deployed first, second, and third, they are required to identify their prioritization
     requirements using the movement priority field for each increment of cargo within the
     LOGPLAN Module of LOGMOD.
  2.35.4. For contingency and crisis action planning, units will use the LOGPLAN movement
  priority field to identify when UTCs and/or increments within a UTC will deploy.
  Movement priority is based on TPFDD C-day requirements, DOC statement response times,
  or HHQ guidance. In LOGMOD, the movement priority field defaults to a zero. Zero is not
  an acceptable value to use when prioritizing movement priorities for UTCs or increments
  within a UTC.
  2.35.5. Two of the most efficient ways of utilizing the movement priority field in LOGMOD
  are “by UTC” or “within a UTC.”
     2.35.5.1. Prioritizing “by UTC” means organizing flow of capabilities by ULN based on
     TPFDD movement dates such as available to load date (ALD), ready to load date (RLD),
     or required delivery date (RDD). This is done by using the movement priority field to
     indicate the date an action is scheduled to occur within the TPFDD.
     2.35.5.2. Prioritizing “within a UTC” means units will prioritize each increment within a
     UTC using the movement priority field to identify the sequence increments should be
     deployed in.

2.36. AF 463L Pallets/Containers.
   2.36.1. AF 463L pallets are the mandatory cargo-packing platform for the AF standard
   LOGDET because they are the most versatile for aircraft load planning.
      2.36.1.1. Internal Airlift/Helicopter Slingable-Container Unit (ISUs) will not be used in
      any portion of a Pilot Unit report or AF standard UTC IAW AFI 10-401, Chapter 5.
      However, pallets with container attached/palletized container or ISU can be used as a
      suitable substitute for 463L pallets in unit LOGPLAN development, providing the UTC
      will not exceed the weight of the approved standard UTC.
      2.36.1.2. Pallets with container attached or palletized containers (i.e. ISUs) must be
      purchased at unit expense.
   2.36.2. Not all types of ISUs will fit on all types of military or commercial aircraft. Units
   will ensure that purchased ISUs will fit on all AMC/commercial type aircraft, including MD-
   11s, DC-8s, KC-10s, KC-46s and KC-135s.
   2.36.3. Units designed to move on their own organic airlift may plan their types of ISU
   purchase/use on that, but it does not relieve them of the requirement to maintain 463L pallets
   and nets in sufficient numbers to meet the determined requirement.
   2.36.4. DELETED
      2.36.4.1. DELETED
      2.36.4.2. Units must maintain and account for pallets and nets used for standard UTC
      requirements.
      2.36.4.3. The IDO must consolidate installation deployment pallet and net requirements
      and forward to the WPNM.
      2.36.4.4. IDOs and units must consider their maximum simultaneous deployment
      capability when determining their operational pallets and nets requirement and will
      identify any shortages or excesses to the WPNM so that assets can be redistributed, as
      required.
      2.36.4.5. (Added-USAFE) The Wing Installation Pallet and Net Manager (WPNM) will
      work in conjunction with the IDRC to develop Wing pallet and net requirements. It is the
      responsibility of the UDM to compute unit requirements. The IDO may compute and
      compile the pallet and net numbers for each unit and present the requirements to the
      WPNM in a format agreed upon locally. The WPNM will be responsible for submitting
      compiled numbers to the MAJCOM pallet and net manager.
   2.36.5. Organization/unit Pallet and Net Managers will monitor, inspect, and report
   operational pallet and net assets IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Part VI, Management and Control of
   Intermodal Containers and System 463L Equipment.

      2.36.5.3. If containers or palletized containers are used, units must be able to meet airlift
      constraints and must not exceed the weight and cube of the standard UTC LOGDET.
      Units with a minimum amount of equipment should continue to use 463L pallets.
  2.36.6. LOGMOD automatically assigns standard planning information (weights,
  dimensional data, and quantities) to items 01, 02, and 03 when pilot/non-pilot units develop
  pallet increment types.
      2.36.6.1. The overall dimensions of a 463L pallet are 88 inches by 108 inches, by 2 1/4
      inches thick. However, the usable dimensions of the upper surface are 84 inches by 104
      inches. This allows for two inches around the periphery to attach straps, nets, or other
      restraint devices. An empty 463L pallet weighs 290 pounds (355 pounds with nets) and
      has a maximum, netted load capacity of 10,000 pounds.
      2.36.6.2. The desired load capacity is 7,500 pounds (to help prolong pallet life).
      2.36.6.3. ISUs, Cadillac Bins, Brooks & Perkins containers, and married pallets/pallet
      trains are not considered LOGMOD Pallet Type Increments and will not be loaded as
      such in the LOGFOR module of LOGMOD.
  2.36.7. Pilot/non-pilot units will load pallet dunnage as Item 04 for all pallet increments
  using the following movement characteristics: Length 88, Width 4, Height 4, Weight 30
  pounds, with a quantity of three. Pilot/non-pilot units will use the appropriate NSNs for
  dunnage obtained through the LRS Materiel Management Flight Customer Service.
      2.36.7.1. Dunnage (e.g. lumber or timber) is placed under 463L pallets to prevent
      damage to the lower pallet surface and to aid in transportation with a forklift.
      2.36.7.2. The minimum dimensions of a piece of dunnage are 3x3x88 inches long. Use
      three pieces to support each loaded 463L pallet while on the ground. Many different
      materials can be used as dunnage.
      2.36.7.3. All 463L pallets will be shipped with dunnage. This is both required for
      deployment and redeployment and must be provided by the user (see T.O. 35D33-2-2-2
      and T.O. 35D33-2-3-1).
      2.36.7.4. Wood Packaging Material (WPM) to include dunnage departing or returning to
      the United States must be stamped or marked with an approved International Standards
      for Phytosanitary Measures 15 or DOD Pest Free Certification Stamp by trained and
      certified DOD personnel IAW AFI 24-203.
  2.36.8. Pilot units will ensure ISUs, Cadillac Bins, or Brooks & Perkins containers are not
  loaded in lieu of, or as a substitute for 463L pallets and nets within standard AF LOGDETs.
      2.36.8.1. Possession of ISUs does not relieve a unit of their responsibility/requirement to
      maintain 463L pallets and nets in sufficient numbers to meet the determined requirement.
      2.36.8.2. EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 25-101, BEAR Order of Battle (BOB) UTCs are
      exempt from this guidance because BEAR must be shipped in Internal Slingable Unit
      (ISU) containers (air shipping configuration) and intermodal containers (surface shipping
      configuration).
      2.36.8.3. MEFPAK Responsible Agency LOGDET Managers will identify all
      LOGDETs that contain ISUs to the pilot unit for immediate corrective action.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                        101


   2.36.9. Pilot units will ensure the palletized increments within the standard UTC LOGDET
   do not exceed 10,000 pounds. Non-pilot units will ensure palletized increments within the
   LOGPLAN Module of LOGMOD do not exceed 10,000 pounds.
   2.36.10. Pilot units will physically build, weigh, and measure each increment of cargo when
   developing and maintaining standard UTC LOGDETs IAW AFI 10-401, Chapter 5.
2.37. Manpower and Personnel Data.
   2.37.1. The MO (IPR for ARC units) will use DCAPES base-unique PIDs as identified by
   MAJCOM DCAPES Sub-FMs to build all UTC requirements available for taskings found in
   the MAJCOM provided UTA listing. This information will be provided to the IDO, UDM,
   and MPF at least on a quarterly basis or when a specific plan is updated (information will be
   available in DCAPES for IDOs and UDMs).
   2.37.2. OPLAN manpower (personnel) taskings are provided by the MAJCOM,
   disseminated by the IDO, and maintained separately by the installation MO (IPR for ARC).
      2.37.2.1. Recommended changes to these requirements will be coordinated through the
      IDO, UDM and MPS.
      2.37.2.2. Tailoring of personnel requirements must follow AFI 10-401, Chapter 10
      guidance.
   2.37.3. MO uses DCAPES to link MANFOR details and the UTA in order to pass the tasked
   UTC to the wings/units.
   2.37.4. At least annually, MO will coordinate with the IDO, and in some cases will conduct,
   a UMD to UTC tasking validation to determine if MAJCOM FAM taskings exceed wing/unit
   UMD.
   2.37.5. At least annually, MO, in coordination with the LRS Plans and Integration Section
   and all affected units, validates UTC(s), AFSC(s), Functional Account Code(s) (FAC), and
   Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) codes with tasked unit(s) and will coordinate corrective
   action(s) required with the unit and/or designated UTC Pilot Units.
   2.37.6. MO will receive the deployment echelon and movement priority sequence
   (deployment sequence) from the Plans and Integration Section/IDO to build the contingency
   DCAPES plans data if TPFDDs are available.
      2.37.6.1. If TPFDDs are not available, the Plans and Integration Section will provide
      PID(s), UTC(s), ULN(s), RDD(s), deployment echelon(s) and deployment sequence
      number(s).
      2.37.6.2. At the discretion of the IDO, MO will coordinate with tasked units’ UDMs to
      validate remaining DCAPES data elements and will coordinate any/all required changes
      as needed through designated UTC Pilot Units.
   2.37.7. The UDMs will:
      2.37.7.1. Validate DCAPES UTC data to ensure tasked AFSCs are assigned against the
      correct PAS and FAC codes, and will coordinate movement priority requirements
      through the LRS Plans and Integration Section/IDO as needed.

       2.37.7.2. Ensure their unit taskings do not exceed their UMD and will coordinate
       corrective action through the MO for resolution.
   2.37.8. ANG and AFRC units are not authorized a MO; therefore, the IPR performs these
   responsibilities. NOTE: These procedures are documented in AFI 36-3802 and AFI 38-205.

Section 2G—Deployment Organizational Structure.

2.38. Deployment Organizational Structure.
   2.38.1. The IDO will:
       2.38.1.1. Define an effective and efficient organizational structure to meet all command
       and control, cargo, and personnel processing requirements for the installation’s maximum
       simultaneous deployment capability.
       2.38.1.2. Establish a DCC to serve as the installation’s focal point for deployment C2
       requirements beyond the normal IDRC capabilities.
       2.38.1.3. Ensure the IDRC is subsumed into the DCC, PDF and CDF as appropriate.
       2.38.1.4. Identify requirements for the DCC, PDF and CDFs to appropriate base agencies
       for staffing and infrastructure support.
       2.38.1.5. Be responsible for standing up the DCC, CDF, PDF, and UDCCs (in
       coordination with owning unit commanders) to meet the requirements of a given
       deployment scenario.
       2.38.1.6. To meet AEF rotation requirements, establish procedures for interfacing with
       the LRS Traffic Management functions responsible for booking passengers commercially
       will also be established. While the IDO may or may not choose to stand up the
       deployment work centers, he or she will ensure the functions of those work centers are
       accomplished for every deployment regardless of the number of personnel or short tons
       deploying. The IDO will accomplish these actions IAW the IDP.
   2.38.2. Deployment Control Center (DCC).
       2.38.2.1. The DCC is the installation/wing focal point for all deployment C2 operations,
       including identifying, verifying and distributing tasking information before, during and
       after execution.
       2.38.2.2. The IDO, through the LRS/Plans and integration Section, will review and
       monitor applicable classified newsgroups, DCAPES PIDs and the AF Tasking
       Notification Tool (TNT) - formerly AF Verification Process within DCAPES to verify
       receipt, acceptance, and shortfalling of taskings.
       2.38.2.3. MAJCOMs will identify which PIDs their wings are responsible for
       monitoring.
       2.38.2.4. The DCC will initiate unit cargo and personnel shortfall procedures IAW AFI
       10-401, this instruction, the AFPC/DPW RPT User manual, supported MAJCOM, and
       the installation/Wing IDP.
          2.38.2.4.1. For AFRC units located on bases where the host is different than their
          gaining MAJCOM, personnel and/or equipment LIMFAC/shortfalls must be
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                       103


        submitted through appropriate personnel channels that will identify these
        requirements to that unit’s gaining MAJCOM.
        2.38.2.4.2. For associate units, tenants and/or Institutional Forces, shortfalls and/or
        shortfall mitigation utilizing associate units must be coordinated through applicable
        components or MAJCOM A4L/A4Rs.
     2.38.2.5. RPT automates the reclama process with a web-based application that allows
     multi-user inputs, automated validation and immediate visibility of shortfall conditions.
        2.38.2.5.1. Shortfalls for requirements sourced by AFPC/DPW are transmitted into
        RPT.
        2.38.2.5.2. It serves to communicate to senior leadership a unit’s inability to meet a
        CCDR operational requirement.
        2.38.2.5.3. New users will contact AFPC/DPW to obtain a RPT account.
     2.38.2.6. The IDO will stand-up the DCC when deployment requirements cannot be
     executed by the IDRC. NOTE: Many factors are weighed in this determination, such as,
     timing, number of UTCs, personnel and equipment tasked, support airlift, etc.
     2.38.2.7. The DCC is responsible for coordinating all transportation actions required to
     deploy the force, coordinating/staffing equipment and personnel shortfalls, controlling
     the overall integration of the PDF, CDF and UDCCs, informing the wing’s CAT of
     process bottlenecks and effectiveness, and coordinating with HHQ, USTRANSCOM, and
     C-NAFs for support when required.
     2.38.2.8. The DCC is responsible for contacting TACC and providing them with the
     required information for all contingency movements involving the movement of
     hazardous UTC cargo, via military or military contracted aircraft, for an approved and
     validated TPFDD requirement. Installations tasked to deploy hazardous UTC cargo (by
     strategic airlift) will complete the following:
        2.38.2.8.1. Develop preliminary load plans, denoting the type of airlift being
        requested, and identify how the hazardous cargo will be positioned on the aircraft.
        2.38.2.8.2. Tasked units will complete a Hazardous Cargo Aircraft Clearance
        Request Worksheet that denotes all hazardous material information being deployed
        for DCC coordination with TACC.
        2.38.2.8.3. Submit primary load plan(s) and applicable Hazardous Cargo Aircraft
        Request     worksheet(s)    to    TACC       (Diplomatic      Clearance      Branch),
        tacc.tadip@scott.af.mil, within 48-hours of notification to deploy in order to ensure
        the adequacy of proposed aircraft and mission plans prior to the movement of
        hazardous cargo from home station.
            2.38.2.8.3.1. Installation/wings will follow the same requirements for real-world
            contingency movements during DEPLOYEX at home stations.
            2.38.2.8.3.2. EXCEPTION: Submission of these documents will be provided to
            the wing inspection team vice TACC, within 48-hours of notification to deploy in
            order to ensure adequacy of proposed aircraft and mission plans.

      2.38.2.9. DCC Manning.
         2.38.2.9.1. DCC functions include the IDO, Logistics Plans, Personnel, Distribution
         Representative, LOGMOD Schedule monitors, Materiel Management, Admin, and
         selected unit representatives.
         2.38.2.9.2. Training for each of the work centers will include a thorough knowledge
         of this instruction, the local IDP, and functional expertise in their respective
         AFSC/function.
         2.38.2.9.3. All DCC personnel require a SECRET clearance.
      2.38.2.10. DCC Requirements.
         2.38.2.10.1. Robust communications in the DCC are essential for positive control.
         Minimum IDS communications requirements include:
             2.38.2.10.1.1. Access to SIPRNET.
             2.38.2.10.1.2. Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET).
             2.38.2.10.1.3. Secure and unsecured telephones.
             2.38.2.10.1.4. Access to unsecured facsimile (fax) machines.
         2.38.2.10.2. DCC personnel require an adequate number of SIPRNET terminals to
         access JOPES, DCAPES, BaS&E, LOGFAC, LOGMOD, classified newsgroups,
         secure web sites, collaborative decision support tools, and other planning aids.
         2.38.2.10.3. DCC key staff should be provided with land mobile radios (LMR) and
         cell telephones, when available.
         2.38.2.10.4. Additional requirements include uninterrupted power and classified
         storage.
         2.38.2.10.5. Video surveillance of marshaling yards and aircraft loading operation

Section 3A—Deployment Planning Overview

3.1. General.
   3.1.1. This chapter will provide general background information related to deployment
   planning processes, TPFDD sourcing (crisis action/rotational AEF), receipt/verification of
   deployment taskings, execution of IDP processes/procedures, deployment reporting, and post
   deployment documentation.
   3.1.2. AFI 10-401 is the primary AF source document and provides detailed guidance for AF
   operations planning and execution to include deployment planning and execution processes
   and procedures. NOTE: AFI 10-401 guidance references will be annotated in parenthesis at
   the end of each paragraph when applicable.
3.2. Deployment Planning Processes.
   3.2.1. Deployment planning is a continuous, iterative, and highly structured process that
   allows for an orderly transition from peace to war and post-hostilities operations.
   3.2.2. Deployment planning ensures the systematic deployment, employment, sustainment,
   and redeployment of U.S. Forces to meet commander requirements across the Range of
   Military Options (ROMO).
   3.2.3. The Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC) uses two general planning
   processes: crisis action and deliberate planning. (AFI 10-401, Chapter 3.)
       3.2.3.1. Crisis action planning is driven by current events in real time and normally
       occurs in emergencies and in the context of time-sensitive situations.
       3.2.3.2. Deliberate planning is accomplished in the absence of an active crisis in
       response to scenarios and threats identified by combatant commanders and in national
       guidance such as the JSCP.
   3.2.4. Currently, crisis action and deliberate planning use different pre-deployment planning
   cycles however the execution processes and ADP used to support deployment operations are
   generally the same.
   3.2.5. The major difference during crisis action and rotational (AEF) deployment execution
   is timing. Deployment operations/execution in support of:
       3.2.5.1. Crisis action operations are initiated by SecDef/CJCS Warning, Planning, Alert,
       Deployment, Prepare to Deploy, and/or Execution Orders.
       3.2.5.2. Rotational (AEF) operations timing is based on a pre-determined AEF rotation
       schedule which supports the Joint Global Force Management (GFM) schedule.
3.3. Crisis Action Planning.
   3.3.1. Deliberate/Crisis Action Planning.
114                                          AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


      3.3.1.1. Combatant commanders, their components, and supporting commands
      accomplish deliberate planning during peacetime conditions. Planners use scenarios and
      threats identified in national guidance, such as the JSCP, along with the combatant
      commander's evaluation of their AOR, to develop a series of plans that span a wide range
      of operations. See AFI 10-401, Chap. 3 for additional information related to deliberate
      and crisis action planning.
      3.3.1.2. This formal process develops responses to potential crises, determines forces
      required to achieve objectives, prepares deployment plans, and continually evaluates
      selected courses of action (COAs). This process results in a series of formal plans within
      each theater that contain lists of apportioned forces and their time-phased deployment
      schedules.
      3.3.1.3. The process for deliberate planning is cyclic and continual and is almost
      identical whether the resulting operation plan is a fully developed OPLAN, CONPLAN,
      or FUNCPLAN. Operations plans remain in effect until canceled or superceded by
      another approved plan. While in effect, they are continuously maintained and updated.
  3.3.2. Crisis Action Planning.
      3.3.2.1. Crisis action planning is driven by current events in real time and normally
      occurs in emergencies and in the context of time-sensitive situations. Planners base their
      efforts on the actual circumstances that exist when crisis action planning occurs. Detailed
      guidance and instructions are located in the APEX Family of Documents (see CJCS
      Guide 3130, Enclosure C).
      3.3.2.2. Each MAJCOM must establish complementary procedures and must ensure
      adequate procedures exist for subordinate command and agency use.
      3.3.2.3. These procedures must be periodically exercised during joint, Service
      component (C-MAJCOM/C-NAF) and installation/wing level exercises to ensure the
      required capability is available.
      3.3.2.4. The JPEC‘s Global Force Management (GFM) process developed policy and
      procedures in support of designated Joint Force Provider/Coordinator (JFP/JFC)
      allocation actions.
         3.3.2.4.1. Commander, Air Combat Command (COMACC), is delegated as the AF
         force provider (AF FP) and supports JS J31 in its role as Global Conventional JFC .
         3.3.2.4.2. Commander, Air Mobility Command (COMACC), is the AF component
         command for USTRANSCOM and acts as the AF FP for mobility forces.
         3.3.2.4.3. Commander, Air Force Special Operations Command, is the AF air
         component for USSOCOM and acts as the AF FP for special operations forces.
         3.3.2.4.4. MAJCOM and AFPC/DPW roles in sourcing crisis requirements will be
         accomplished IAW AFI 10-401 to determine sourcing recommendations and issues
         related to risk to sourcing other requirements, sustainability assessment and issues
         identified by other combatant commanders.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                         115


          3.3.2.4.5. AFPC/DPW and each MAJCOM must establish complementary
          procedures for sourcing crisis requirements and ensure adequate procedures exist for
          subordinate units.
      3.3.2.5. The AF FP, in coordination with the designated JFP:
          3.3.2.5.1. Determines AF sourcing solutions that satisfy validated combatant
          command requests for capability/forces (RFC/RFF) of conventional forces.
          3.3.2.5.2. Coordinates and recommends actions to sustain the level of capabilities or
          globally available forces to respond to validated combatant commander requirements.
3.4. Force Rotation (AEF) Planning.
   3.4.1. Force rotational plans support the GFM requirement of an immediate executable
   schedule. The AEF construct is the Air Force methodology of meeting existing and emerging
   worldwide CCDR requirements as depicted in the SecDef-approved GFMAP.
   3.4.2. CJCS orders to the supported commander, supporting commanders, and Services
   initiate such operations. These orders define plan details and requirements to accomplish the
   mission and authority to deploy forces. In accordance with CJCSM 3122.02C, such orders
   will specify weapons systems and a description of the ECS capability needed to sustain the
   operation.
      3.4.2.1. Additional orders will need to be issued when an operation becomes a rotational
      mission and the Air Force, as a Service, or all force providing combatant commanders are
      not identified to support.
   3.4.3. The supported component headquarters, in coordination with AFPC/DPW, is
   responsible for preparing the force rotation plan and ensuring the plan is time-phased to meet
   the AEF battle rhythm.
      3.4.3.1. The component headquarters will coordinate with AFPC/DPW to identify UTC
      capabilities from the AETF force modules and UTC Availability necessary to sustain the
      crisis operation and transition from crisis to rotational operations.
      3.4.3.2. A CJCS DEPORD and ensuing AF EXORD will be used to task and deploy AF
      forces for each AEF rotation.
      3.4.3.3. The supported component headquarters will not source a requirement identified
      in the force rotation TPFDD IAW AFI 10-401, Chapter 9.
   3.4.4. ARC Participation.
      3.4.4.1. During each AEF vulnerability period, the deploying AEFs will have force
      elements provided by AFRC and ANG units. These units fill the applicable rotation by
      teaming (when feasible) units and personnel and rainbowing equipment.
      3.4.4.2. Specific methodology for meeting this objective is managed by the AFRC and
      ANG. ARC force volunteerism is maximized by providing rotation and tour duration
      flexibility. Component headquarters will consider the appropriate rotation policy and tour
      length with the goal of maximizing ARC volunteerism.
 116                                          AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


Section 3B—Sourcing Overview

3.5. TPFDD Sourcing.
   3.5.1. To assist with the identification of TPFDD requirements for AEF sourcing,
   AFPC/DPW establishes force modules (FMs) for new and rotational requirements which are
   disseminated via the AFPC/DPW AEF Operation’s AEF Rotation Sourcing Plans and Tasks
   message. See AFI 10-401, Chapter 9 for additional information related to TPFDD sourcing
   processes and procedures.
   3.5.2. FMs allow the supported component headquarters to quickly identify and
   communicate valid requirements for Air Force sourcing. The component headquarters will
   place requirements reviewed and accepted in a designated FM during planning for each AEF
   ‘s rotation. Force providing organizations delegated authority to write to the supported
   commanders TPFDD must adhere to these guidelines.

Section 3C—Verification Overview

3.6. TPFDD Verification.
   3.6.1. Verification is the process whereby MAJCOMs/DRUs/FOAs/Service Components
   accomplish JOPES requirements to finalize the sourcing process. See AFI 10-401, Chapter 8
   for additional information related to TPFDD verification.
       3.6.1.1. During the verification process, every responsible agency ensures the sourced
       UTC/UIC has the required complements to meet the requirement; the applicable forces
       are available and ready; forces have been alerted for deployment; and the cargo is tailored
       to level-4 detail, if applicable. Verification completes the sourcing process.
       3.6.1.2. Air Force planners and FAMs at all levels must ensure that the TPFDD
       accurately reflects and is consistent with actual resources that units will deploy.
       3.6.1.3. Failure to accomplish this verification could result in misstating planned airlift
       requirements and possibly delaying the execution of a combatant commander‘s plan.
       3.6.1.4. Component headquarters will source requirements from their in-theater assets to
       the maximum extent possible before initiating an RFF/RFC to their CCDR.
       3.6.1.5. AFPC/DPW will work closely with the component headquarters and force
       providers to efficiently source and ensure timely verification by the Force Provider of
       UTC that will be available as postured in the UTC Availability in DCAPES and reported
       as ready in the AEF UTC Reporting Tool (ART).
   3.6.2. Crisis Action Sourcing.
       3.6.2.1. Component headquarters planners will determine and input requirements into the
       applicable CCDR TPFDD.
       3.6.2.2. Force providers will first source requirements from Air Force forces assigned to
       the CCDR/CCMD TPFDD.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                        117


          3.6.2.2.1. Component headquarters should not source assigned forces tasked in the
          current FY GFMAP if the tasking will interfere with the subsequent SECDEF-
          ordered tasking.
          3.6.2.2.2. All emergent CCDR requirements that cannot be met with assigned forces
          should generate an RFF/RFC in accordance with CJCSM 3122.01A.
      3.6.2.3. Once an RFF/RFC has been submitted and validated by the Joint Staff, the
      RFF/RFC will be vetted through the JFP to the AF FP IAW AFI 10-401, Chapter. 1.
      3.6.2.4. AF FPs will collect inputs from their respective HAF and/or MAJCOM FAMs
      and AFPC/DPW to develop a recommended sourcing solution.
          3.6.2.4.1. If a standard Air Force capability within existing resources can meet the
          requirement, then AF FPs recommend a standard sourcing solution.
          3.6.2.4.2. If a standard Air Force capability cannot meet the requirement, AF FPs, in
          conjunction with applicable HAF FAMs, evaluate the RFF/RFC for possible non-
          standard sourcing solutions in accordance with paragraph AFI 10-401, Chapter 2 and
          Table 2.1.
          3.6.2.4.3. The AF internally refers to non-standard force sourcing solutions as Joint
          Expeditionary Taskings (JET).
          3.6.2.4.4. AEFC/DPW sources forces IAW AFI 10-401, Chapter 8.
          3.6.2.4.5. Force providers verify to the component headquarters the readiness of
          sourced forces IAW AFI 10-401, Chapter 8 to include the ability to meet the TPFDD
          timelines.
   3.6.3. For rotational (AEF) TPFDDs, AFPW/DPW will:
      3.6.3.1. Place AEF sourcing that requires verification in a designated FM, in accordance
      with the AEF rotation sourcing plans and tasks message.
      3.6.3.2. Post FM requiring verification in an accompanying newsgroup to establish the
      verification suspense.
      3.6.3.3. Ensure verification is completed in accordance with timelines depicted in AFI
      10-401, Table 8.5.
      3.6.3.4. After the AFPC/DPW sourcing and verification FM has been suspensed,
      verifying agencies do not have to wait for release of the subsequent verification FMs to
      apply verification.
      3.6.3.5. MAJCOMs FAMs and/or war planners will ensure IDRCs are informed of wing
      AEF sourcing by use of DCAPES and Tasking Notification Tool (TNT).
3.7. MAJCOM Verification.
   3.7.1. Reclama procedures will be processed in accordance with AFI 10-401, Chapter 10.
   3.7.2. Newly sourced requirements will be placed in a verification FM and force providers
   must verify within timelines depicted in AFI 10-401, Table 8.5.
   3.7.3. Equipment Requirements and Sourcing
 118                                          AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


       3.7.3.1. The force provider will identify sourcing solutions to AFPC/DPW for
       equipment-only UTCs not directly tied to a unit (e.g., vehicles) postured in the AEF
       Tempo Bands or Enabler force. UTCs that contain both MANFOR and LOGFOR detail
       will be sourced by AFPC/DPW using the same procedures and priorities as personnel-
       only UTCs IAW AFI 10-401, Chapter 9.
       3.7.3.2. Due to the sensitivity of AFSOC's SOF mission and AMC's global MAF
       support, these mission requirements will continue to be sourced by the respective
       MAJCOMs. HQ AMC will source unique theater requirements for mobility support.
       3.7.3.3. The ECS SIPT is the focal point for coordinating all issues and concerns relative
       to equipment sourcing.
3.8. Tasking Notification Process.
   3.8.1. AFPC/DPW provides oversight of the tasking notification process for all TPFDDs
   sourced using AEF scheduled assets IAW AFI 10-401, Chapter 9.
       3.8.1.1. It is responsible for controlling visibility for these TPFDDs and will provide
       automated support using DCAPES to base-level IDRC, manpower and personnel
       readiness offices, PERSCO teams, and central sites.
       3.8.1.2. AFPC/DPW provides visibility after coordination with and receiving the
       approval of the supported component headquarters.
   3.8.2. Assigning names to requirements in DCAPES is critical to the entire deployment
   process.
       3.8.2.1. Deploying members must be identified and updated in system IAW AFI 36-3802
       to ensure name visibility of members projected to deploy, to facilitate any advance
       training requirements, and schedule an appropriate airlift mission to meet the supported
       commander‘s DRI/RDD.
       3.8.2.2. AEFC/DPW will provide a bi-weekly nameless ULN report to the MAJCOMs
       for further processing with the MAJCOM FAMs and appropriate wing staffs.
       Additionally, at least 45 – 60 days following an AEF rotation, AEFC/DPW will publish
       metrics data depicting the percentage of names received in a specific window for the
       MAJCOM AEF Debriefs. Applicable window range covers 45+ days prior to the RDD,
       31-44 days prior to the RDD, 0-30 days prior to the RDD or names received after the
       RDD has passed as of the report date.

Section 3D—Employment Overview

3.9. Employment.
   3.9.1. The AEF employment objective is to meet a supported combatant commander‘s needs
   through the COMAFFOR with relevant UTC capabilities-based AETF packages (AEWs and
   AEGs) in accordance with validated theater mission requirements, as identified by the
   TPFDD. Planning must focus on sustained execution in the area of operations for the AEF
   execution period by integrating AEW, AEG, and AES command, operations, and support
   elements into an integrated, cohesive force. (AFI 10-401, Chapter 9)
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                          119


   3.9.2. AEF on-call forces will maintain the capability to rapidly transition from normal day-
   to-day operations to crisis response operations. Unit posture will increase consistent with the
   issuance and receipt of CJCS Warning/Planning/Alert/Deployment Order, Prepare to Deploy
   Order, and/or Execution Order
   3.9.3. Theater combatant commander mission requirements dictate response-timing
   constraints.
      3.9.3.1. In general, CONOPS should allow for a stair-step of response timing to reduce
      alert requirements. Service components must prepare to deploy forces, particularly ECS
      forces, during the initial phases of contingencies.
      3.9.3.2. Personnel will deploy only after receipt of valid contingency, exercise, and
      deployment (CED) orders and validation by the installation deployment officer (IDO)
      that the unit line number (ULN) has been validated in the TPFDD by the supported
      commander.

Section 3E—Shortfall/Reclama Overview

3.10. Shortfall and Reclama Procedures.
   3.10.1. Air Force active duty, AFRC, ANG, MAJCOMs, wings, groups, and units will make
   every effort to meet all taskings.
      3.10.1.1. Generally, relief will only be sought when a wing or tasked unit does not
      possess sufficient or qualified personnel to support a tasking or the tasking is impossible
      to meet or will shut down critical elements of the home station mission, as determined by
      the wing commander or equivalent.
      3.10.1.2. Filling shortfalls in one UTC could mean moving a person from another UTC
      as long as the individual(s) are within the same AEF vulnerability period.
      3.10.1.3. Units will immediately update ART to reflect the status of the UTC(s).
      3.10.1.4. IDOs will submit reclamas to their MAJCOM if no other installation/Wing
      resources are available to fill shortfalls. (See AFI 10-401 for details on processing
      reclamas and UIC Changes via RPT)
3.11. AEF Construct.
   3.11.1. The AEF is the USAF‘s construct for meeting global CCDR requirements.
      3.11.1.1. Employing forces via the AEF construct to meet non-CCDR requirements (e.g.
      Service-unique requirements, MAJCOM manning assist, etc.) reduces the ability to meet
      the global CCDR contingency requirement.
      3.11.1.2. Using the AEF construct to meet non-CCDR requirements will be approved by
      AF/A3/5 on a case-by-case basis.
   3.11.2. The supported organization requesting use of AEF forces will submit deviation
   request through their owning MAJCOM. MAJCOMs will coordinate with AF/A1 and
   sponsoring HAF DCS (if applicable) prior to seeking A3/5 approval.
   3.11.3. AFPC/DPW will build ULNs in a 08-series PID and source requirements IAW AFI
   10-401, Chapter 9 using only SECAF-retained and/or supported MAJCOM-owned forces.
 120                                          AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


   Note: The use of 08-series PIDs is for accounting purposes only; USTRANSCOM will not
   assign lift against Service PIDs.

Section 3F—Installation/Wing/Unit Level Deployment Operations(Rotational AEF)

3.12. Installation/Wing/Unit Deployment Operations (Rotational AEF Operations).
   3.12.1. Tasking information will flow from JOPES through DCAPES to tasked
   installations/units.
   3.12.2. To preclude delaying tasking notifications to appropriate Airmen, IDOs and the
   IDRC will monitor DCAPES (at least twice a day) for new, modified, and/or deleted
   taskings. In addition, it is imperative that other sources of tasking information be constantly
   monitored such as SIPRNET web pages, DCAPES, Web-Hoc Query, and Newsgroups.
   Establish dialogue with MAJCOM, NAF, or component CAT Cells or Operations Centers.
   3.12.3. Unit commanders will review taskings and identify LIMFAC/shortfalls and update as
   required. The Plans and Integration Section will review the LIMFAC/shortfalls of the
   affected units so any problems expected are known ahead of time.
3.13. Tasking Receipt.
   3.13.1. Once the base receives a deployment tasking, the base implements its deployment
   process IAW the IDP.
       3.13.1.1. Tasking information flows continually throughout the AEF vulnerability
       period.
       3.13.1.2. The IDO must establish a system of notification to the Installation/Wing
       Commander and key senior leadership of each tasking.
       3.13.1.3. As a minimum, the IDO will notify key personnel within the IDRC (in the
       absence of the IDRC, notify IPR and LRS Plans & Integration personnel) and respective
       units of each tasking within 24-hours of receipt of tasking.
   3.13.2. Upon direction from the IDO:
       3.13.2.1. The IDRC will load the personnel levy flow file into LOGMOD.
       3.13.2.2. The UDM will load tasked personnel in LOGMOD for transfer back to
       DCAPES.
       3.13.2.3. Institutional Force and extended deployment taskings are received from AFPC
       with the name already in system; consolidating passenger data in LOGMOD of attached
       or supported Institutional Forces outside of the host organizational structure is not
       required.
3.14. Tasking Verification.
   3.14.1. Verification confirms the sourced data reflects actual data provided by the base or
   unit.
       3.14.1.1. During the verification process (see Attachment 4 for wing verification
       process), every responsible agency after the MAJCOM validation, starts with the IDRC
       confirming the sourced UTC/UIC has the required element(s) to meet the requirement;
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                           121


     applicable forces are available and ready; forces have been alerted for deployment; and
     the cargo is tailored to level-4 detail, and passenger line-level detail is tailored to match
     level-2 detail, if applicable.
     3.14.1.2. ANG units will verify taskings IAW with ANG MAJCOM supplement.
  3.14.2. MAJCOM AEF Cells in conjunction with MAJCOM FAMs initiate the verification
  process by confirming unit capability to fill UTC taskings. NOTE: Contacting tasked units is
  not required in every case e.g. if a unit is reporting Green in ART there is no need for contact
  except when the tasking requirement is short notice (30 days or less to first movement).
  3.14.3. MAJCOMs must notify units directly to meet short notice alerts/taskings received
  during non-duty days that require immediate attention. In support of AEF rotations, Log
  Plans, IPR, or Manpower Office personnel in the IDRC will check DCAPES at least twice
  daily during normal duty hours for new, changed or deleted taskings.
  3.14.4. When a new tasking or change to an existing tasking is received, the IDRC will
  verify it within (2) duty days (or within 24-hours for short-notice taskings i.e. within 45-days
  of first movement) of receipt before forwarding to the appropriate unit(s). NOTE: ANG
  units will follow their higher headquarters guidance on verification procedures. Verification
  includes:
     3.14.4.1. IDRC Manpower (IPR in the ARC) personnel ensure the UIC for the tasking is
     appropriate. If not, the IDO will contact the sourcing agency (e.g. MAJCOM FAM) for
     re-sourcing to the appropriate UIC. NOTE: UIC change requests are accomplished in
     RPT, if UIC is known.
     3.14.4.2. The tasked unit, in coordination with the IDRC, ensures the required AFSC
     exists in the tasked unit and it is postured in the appropriate AEF block, unless surge
     operations are approved.
     3.14.4.3. Research MISCAP substitution rules and consult with the applicable UDMs for
     possible tasking resolution. If not properly postured, communication between the IDRC,
     tasked unit, MAJCOM FAM and AFPC/DPW is required for clarification.
     3.14.4.4. If no capability exists at the installation/base, reclama the tasking to the tasking
     source IAW this instruction and AFI 10-401.
     3.14.4.5. Individual (by name) deployment taskings sourced via MilPDS for institutional
     forces or 365-day extended deployments are processed IAW AFI 10-401, Chapter 10.
     3.14.4.6. Ensures the LAD/RDD specified for the GEOLOC is feasible and attainable.
     Taskings should allow lead time at base level to allow for completion of Just-in-Time
     (JIT) training, equipment preparation, en route training, flight arrangements, etc.
         3.14.4.6.1. If the RDD is not feasible, the IDRC’s IPR will contact the deployed
         PERSCO or deployed commander IAW this AFI and AFI 36-3802 with a delayed
         reporting request/notification.
         3.14.4.6.2. Request for RDD adjustments through the supported command will only
         be made to comply with the timeline standard for verification in AFI 10-401, unless a
         more stringent timeline is stated in the DEPORD. If the RDD cannot be met due to
         completion of JIT training, equipment preparation, or flight arrangements, contact the
 122                                           AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


          deployed PERSCO or deployed commander IAW this AFI and AFI 36-3802 with a
          delayed reporting request/notification.
       3.14.4.7. Identify any incomplete or missing data (i.e. incomplete or unlisted
       line/command remarks). The sourcing agency will be contacted to clarify any
       inconsistencies.
       3.14.4.8. If the tasking does not require any corrections, the IDO will accept the tasking
       in DCAPES. If required, corrections will be submitted via a reclama and/or UIC Change
       via RPT IAW AFI 10-401 using the instructions in the RPT User Manual.
   3.14.5. The IDRC will upload the tasking into LOGMOD or other locally approved tasking
   notification method as identified in the IDP and forward to the tasked unit/UDM. The
   notification to the unit will be NLT (1) duty day after receipt of tasking.
   3.14.6. Units will provide equipment and personnel info back to the IDRC to fulfill taskings
   IAW Chapters 4 and 5, respectively, or provide shortfall documentation
   3.14.7. The IPR updates DCAPES with tasked personnel information IAW the timelines
   established in AFI 36-3802. NOTE: Automatic rule sets in DCAPES will be used to verify
   personnel deployment eligibility. If the system flags a condition preventing assignment to
   the UTC, and an approved waiver is not already on file, SSN(s) will be returned to the UDM
   for waiver and/or reclama processing actions.
   3.14.8. Within (1) duty day of the IDRC receiving validation of deployment eligibility from
   the UDM, the IDO in coordination with TMO will ensure appropriate mode of transportation
   is available to meet TPFDD ALD for personnel moves.
   3.14.9. On behalf of the IDO, the IDRC will verify requirements can be supported to the
   MAJCOM AEF Cell, MAJCOM planners and/or FAMs will complete tasking notification
   and initiate TPFDD verification actions IAW AFI 10-401 and JOPES processes contained in
   CJCSM 3122.02.
3.15. Requirements Validation.
   3.15.1. The validation process begins once the FP has verified the sourcing. During
   execution, movement data within a TPFDD must be validated in order to schedule
   appropriate strategic transportation or book channel missions in GATES. “Validate” in this
   context is defined in Joint Publications as: “Execution procedure used by combatant
   command components, supporting CCDRs, and providing organizations to confirm to the
   supported commander that all the information records in a TPFDD are not only error-free,
   but also accurately reflect the current status, attributes (lower level personnel and cargo data),
   and availability of units and requirements.”
   3.15.2. AF planners and FAMs must ensure timelines established to support the sourcing,
   verification, and validation process are followed. The standard timeline for completing
   sourcing will be IAW respective TPFDD Letters of Instruction (LOIs). Wings/installations
   will follow this instruction, AFI 10-401, and AFI 36-3802 timelines for filling or shortfalling
   requirements.
   3.15.3. The 6-month (Bands B-E) on-call/deployment period is based on a rotational
   environment where all requirements are known and can be met with the forces allocated
   within AEF Bands in the AEF vulnerability period or Enablers.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                           123


      3.15.3.1. Individuals and equipment allocated to UTCs within the current AEF rotation
      must not participate in any activity that directly impacts their availability to deploy
      during this period.
      3.15.3.2. Scheduled leaves during the deployment/on-call period will be scrutinized to
      ensure member’s ability to respond quickly, if required.
      3.15.3.3. Transportation arrangements into the AOR are influenced by availability of
      airlift, which is influenced by world events and subject to change prior to actual lift date.
3.16. Travel Requirements Verification.
   3.16.1. The IDO and IDRC personnel must work closely together to ensure individuals and
   equipment meet deployment timing and mode of travel as specified in the PID/TPFDD
   tasking for personnel/equipment leaving their installation. In order to best help IDRC, PDF,
   and/or CDF personnel plan movement, the IDO first needs to make some decisions based on
   an analysis of the TPFDD ALDs/RDDs against the strategic lift airflow will provide the
   priority for UTC movement and will ask the following questions:
      3.16.1.1. What is the APOE for the personnel/equipment leaving the base?
      3.16.1.2. Is the origin the APOE or will movement to an APOE be required?
      3.16.1.3. If moving to an APOE, is the appropriate transportation being used? Is ground
      transportation, commercial airline, Group Operational Passenger System (GOPAX),
      aggregated passengers using CONUS to CONUS Contingency movement (CCPAX) used
      where appropriate?
      3.16.1.4. Is the APOE a military installation or international airport?
      3.16.1.5. If it is a military installation, does deploying members have their reporting
      instructions/equipment preparation requirements from their respective IDO and/or base
      Transportation Officer?
      3.16.1.6. What is the Mode/Source for the personnel departing the base? If the
      Mode/Source is “AC - Air via supporting commander channel (AMC or Service) aircraft,
      does the IDO ensure the IDRC makes appropriate arrangements to ensure passengers
      meet their RDD at the end destination?
      3.16.1.7. If the Mode/Source is “AK - Air via strategic (AMC, AMC-contract) aircraft,
      does the IDO ensure the TACC has made travel arrangements to ensure passengers meet
      their RDD at the end destination?
   3.16.2. DELETED
   3.16.3. If the APOE is not home station, the IDO will ensure the IDRC makes appropriate
   arrangements to meet the APOE ALD e.g. commercial airlines, buses, organic or commercial
   trucks, or GOPAX through the Tanker/Airlift Control Center (TACC).
3.17. Movement Flow Schedule.
   3.17.1. The IDRC will coordinate with its MAJCOM, or component headquarters, who will
   then coordinate with 618 AOC, TACC, for airflow and/or surface movement information
   during normal rotations in support of Combat Air Forces/Mobility Air Forces (CAF/MAF)
 124                                         AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


   strategic airlift support. Airlift support for ECS will be coordinated with TACC by the
   component headquarters and verified for validation to USTRANSCOM.
   3.17.2. For visibility of airflow, the IDRC will access DCAPES, Global Decision Support
   System (GDSS), SMS and/or IGC. If airlift is not visible after the USTRANSCOM (USTC)
   Status Codes in the TPFDD shows lift is allocated (“A”), then the IDRC should contact their
   MAJCOM AEF Cell who will then contact the TACC for status.
   3.17.3. Monitor Status. A designated POC in each work center should provide status of
   deployment issues to the IDO/IDRC, who is responsible for status reporting to the CAT.
   Also, POCs will report LIMFAC/shortfalls status. LOGMOD Schedule screens, status
   boards, and other electronic media are helpful management tools for tracking deployment
   status.
   3.17.4. Monitor Tasking Changes. Due to dynamic situations, taskings and priorities may
   change. Beddown sites, number and type of aircraft required, aircraft configurations, and so
   on, can cause extensive changes to unit deployment efforts. In addition, DPW or FAMs at
   the MAJCOMs could determine a particular unit tasking has higher priorities than others.
   Units will monitor the situation closely and tailor their actions to reflect any changes in
   priorities.
   3.17.5. Units will prioritize the movement of cargo and passengers as directed in DCAPES
   (or, at a minimum, LOGPLAN) to meet the RDD specified by the Supported Command. The
   primary method of scheduling personnel and cargo is the LOGMOD Schedule.
3.18. Waivers.
   3.18.1. DELETED
   3.18.2. DELETED
   3.18.3. Tasking Waivers. Prior to submitting a reclama, the tasked commander, through IPR
   and deployed PERSCO, will request the deployed Group Commander waive any restriction
   (e.g. line remarks, SEI, grade, skill level, etc.) or permit substitutions through the waiver
   process contained in AFI 10-401 and AFI 36-3802.
   3.18.4. Unit commanders will:
       3.18.4.1. Submit reclamas for personnel and equipment shortfalls via RPT IAW AFI 10-
       401.
       3.18.4.2. Ensure they have thoroughly reviewed all reclamas to ensure that every option
       regarding AFSC or equipment substitution (IAW UTC MISCAP, functional guidance,
       etc.), risk mitigation, etc. have been considered for their respective unit prior to
       submitting a reclama.
       3.18.4.3. DELETED
   3.18.5. The IDO will:
       3.18.5.1. Provide personnel shortfalls to the IDRC (IPR and MO representatives will
       consider substitutions IAW UTC MISCAPs, line remarks, or as approved by the
       deployed commander.)
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                             125


      3.18.5.2. Provide equipment shortfalls to the LRS Equipment Accountability Office
      (EAO).
      3.18.5.3. The IDRC and LRS EAO will use functional resources to confirm the unit
      shortfall and scrub available wing resources for fill actions.
      3.18.5.4. DELETED
      3.18.5.5. Use equipment with the same national stock number (NSN) and/or a suitable
      substitute as approved by MEFPAK Responsible Agency FAMs for applicable
      LOGDET. Suitable replacements and/or further reclamas must be IAW AFI 10-401,
      Chapter 10.
      3.18.5.6. The IDO will monitor reclama status via secure RPT available through the AEF
      Online Portal at the following website: https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil/default.aspx.
   3.18.6. The IDRC IPR will:
      3.18.6.1. Review chain-of-command resources to see if individuals with the required
      AFSCs are located elsewhere within the wing or wing equivalent on the base in the same
      MAJCOM in the same AEF (not required for Institution Forces or extended
      deployments).
      3.18.6.2. Check for individuals matching the allowable substitutions identified in the
      UTC MISCAP, line remarks, or approved AFSC waiver from the deployed commander.
      NOTE: IDRC is responsible for coordinating replacement actions.
      3.18.6.3. Fill that role if the DCC is not activated.
      3.18.6.4. Identify substitutions to their MAJCOM for resourcing to correct unit.
      3.18.6.5. Submit a shortfall, if the installation/wing cannot support the tasking or the
      AFSC is not on base.
   3.18.7. See AFI 10-401, Chapter 2 for use of Institutional Forces.

Section 3G—Installation/Wing/Unit Level Deployment Operations (Crisis Action)

3.19. Installation/Wing/Unit Deployment Operations (Crisis Operations).
   3.19.1. During a crisis or in the build up to a response to a crisis, units should expect to see a
   warning order (WARNORD), planning order (PLANORD), alert order (ALERTORD),
   and/or PTDO prior to receipt of the EXORD and/or DEPORD.
      3.19.1.1. While these orders are normally sent only to MAJCOM headquarters and not
      directly to the wings, applicable MAJCOMs, NAFs or equivalent CAT(s) are responsible
      for retransmitting the order(s) to affected wings. This requires prompt action since timely
      receipt of these orders may not occur.
      3.19.1.2. MAJCOMs/NAFs receive information via secure telephone, message traffic, or
      GCCS newsgroups and pass related information to subordinate units using similar
      methods.
      3.19.1.3. Tasking information will flow from JOPES through DCAPES to the tasked
      installations/units. Further, there will often be information flow before an official order.
126                                         AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


      3.19.1.4. Upon receipt of applicable orders, the host installation/wing command post will
      immediately notify, at a minimum, the IDO and host installation commander. See JP 5-0,
      Joint Operation Planning, Figure II-10, for a description of types of orders.
  3.19.2. The order may not contain any specific taskings for a specific weapon system.
  Compare available plans and details of the WARNORD, PLANORD, and/or ALERTORD
  for clues as to what may be coming.
      3.19.2.1. If the message contains actual UTCs or weapon systems identification, actual
      preparatory movement actions may begin.
      3.19.2.2. Unless the pending action is in an area with no plan on the shelf, it may be
      necessary to read over the current plan for the AOR in question. Read the plan’s
      summary, LOI, basic plan, annexes C & D, and other applicable functional annexes.
  3.19.3. Once the IDO receives the applicable orders (or other indications of an imminent
  deployment), the IDO should host a meeting to:
      3.19.3.1. Review the tasking(s).
         3.19.3.1.1. Prioritize tasked UTCs.
         3.19.3.1.2. Identify LIMFACs/shortfalls.
      3.19.3.2. Establish a concept of operations and concept of logistics support (if enough
      detail is available).
      3.19.3.3. DELETED
      3.19.3.4. Members at this meeting will include, at a minimum:
         3.19.3.4.1. IDO.
         3.19.3.4.2. Logistics Plans representative.
         3.19.3.4.3. IPR representative.
         3.19.3.4.4. MO representative.
         3.19.3.4.5. LRS (Supply) representative.
         3.19.3.4.6. LRS (Transportation) representative.
         3.19.3.4.7. UDMs with possible tasked UTCs.
  3.19.4. To preclude delaying tasking notifications to appropriate Airmen, the DCC will:
      3.19.4.1. Monitor DCAPES (DMR Change Logs) twice a day for new, modified, or
      deleted taskings.
      3.19.4.2. Monitor other sources of tasking information such as SIPRNET web pages,
      Web-Hoc Query, and Newsgroups.
      3.19.4.3. Establish dialogue with MAJCOM, NAFs, or component CAT Cells and/or
      operations centers.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                        127


3.20. Standby Personnel.
   3.20.1. Place personnel on standby IAW MAJCOM directives. The requirement for standby
   (recall, if required) varies from MAJCOM to MAJCOM. Make personnel available if a
   known tasking is coming. Placing personnel on standby will allow maximum flexibility in
   responding to whatever tasking is received.
   3.20.2. Follow the MAJCOM and Installation/Wing Commander’s direction for placing
   personnel on stand-by.
   3.20.3. At a minimum, the DCC staff will be recalled or notified when the Installation/Wing
   Commander is notified.
   3.20.4. The IDO will alert the FSS Commander of the potential need to activate the PDF and
   the LRS/LGRD (or APS at CONUS AMC strategic aerial port) of the potential to activate the
   CDF.
3.21. Crisis Action Taskings.
   3.21.1. The command post will provide tasking messages to the Installation/Wing
   Commanders and the IDO immediately upon receipt.
       3.21.1.1. The IDO will notify the DCC staff immediately if CAT validation results in
       changes.
       3.21.1.2. Simultaneously, the IDO will notify deployment workcenters and tasked units
       of message receipt and actions required.
       3.21.1.3. A DEPORD or EXORD message date/time group establishes the Reference
       Start Time (RST). NOTE: RST is the date and time from which all execution efforts
       begin.
   3.21.2. If directed by the wing/installation commander, the IDO will provide a concept brief
   to senior leadership, unit commanders, deployment workcenter supervision and UDMs.
   3.21.3. The concept briefing sets the tone for the deployment and ensures all deploying and
   support units understand the tasking, the deployment schedule, and critical employment site
   information that could affect the mission, health, and safety of deploying personnel.
   3.21.4. IDOs will ensure applicable data is briefed to ensure successful deployment
   execution. Refer to Attachment 7 for a recommended Deployment Concept Brief outline.

Section 3H—Installation Deployment Plan (IDP) Execution

3.22. IDP Execution.
   3.22.1. Once the base receives a DEPORD or EXORD, the installation implements its
   deployment process IAW the IDP.
   3.22.2. Implementing the IDP will help to ensure all augmentees are available and will assist
   in activating the required work centers with needed equipment and supplies to conduct 24-
   hour operations, as needed.
 128                                         AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


3.23. Deployment Workcenters Activation.
   3.23.1. Deployment management requires all agencies responsible for deployment actions to
   work together to ensure they meet all taskings. Usually the installation/wing’s deployment
   organization is not fully activated until an installation receives a tasking to deploy.
   3.23.2. Time requirements for activating work centers are not dictated, so each installation
   must determine when to activate their work centers according to the situation at hand. The
   following paragraphs explain the purpose and suggested activation priority supporting the
   wing deployment process.
       3.23.2.1. CAT Activation.
          3.23.2.1.1. Early in a crisis, the focus is on gathering and disseminating accurate
          information. Command and control is critical to important agencies such as the base
          command post, CAT, and the DCC.
          3.23.2.1.2. Although each command and unit has its own CAT activation procedures,
          generally expect CAT activation in stages. As action by the unit becomes more
          likely, CAT director should activate the full team.
          3.23.2.1.3. CATs positively affect deployment processes by monitoring and engaging
          with the following: tracking of shortfalls until relieved by HHQ; confirming
          transportation requirements against actual airlift provided; questioning bottlenecks in
          personnel/equipment processes; validity of personnel personnel/equipment tailoring
          actions based on mission/location; involvement of unit commanders with the
          presentation of UTCs for processing; responsiveness to HHQ messages and
          installation/wing responses; and safety.
       3.23.2.2. DCC Activation.
          3.23.2.2.1. Activate the DCC in time to allow representatives the necessary time
          needed to translate the DEPORD/EXORD, establish communications with HHQ, and
          prepare the LOGMOD Schedule.
          3.23.2.2.2. The IDO will activate other work centers in enough time to begin
          accepting cargo and personnel for processing based on the LOGMOD Schedule.
          3.23.2.2.3. When activated, the DCC serves as the focal point for all deployment C2
          actions on an installation and reports to the CAT.
          3.23.2.2.4. The IDO must establish lines of communication between higher
          headquarters, the CAT, deployment work centers, and the DCC, and between the
          DCC and tasked units. All information essential to deployment operations will pass
          through the DCC.
          3.23.2.2.5. The IDO will use approved command and control systems such as
          DCAPES and LOGMOD to ensure everyone is informed of installation/wing TPFDD
          taskings.
       3.23.2.3. Cargo Deployment Function (CDF) Activation.
          3.23.2.3.1. Activate the CDF when directed by the IDO.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                            129


          3.23.2.3.2. The CDF OIC/NCOIC will ensure all required resources are readily
          available to properly transport, receive, inspect, marshal, and load cargo to meet
          support transportation requirements.
          3.23.2.3.3. The CDF will develop clear procedures if both air and surface operations
          are required.
      3.23.2.4. Personnel Deployment Function (PDF) Activation.
          3.23.2.4.1. The IDO, in coordination with the FSS OPSO, activates the PDF.
          3.23.2.4.2. The PDF OIC/NCOIC will ensure all required resources are readily
          available to properly account for, process, manifest and load deploying personnel for
          transportation requirements.
      3.23.2.5. Unit Deployment Control Centers (UDCC) Activation.
          3.23.2.5.1. Unit commanders will activate UDCCs upon direction of the CAT or IDO
          (24-hour operations, if needed).
          3.23.2.5.2. UDMs will gather work center members and brief them on all the
          deployment information and advise them when to set up the cargo/unit assembly
          areas.
          3.23.2.5.3. UDCCs will deactivate after approval by the IDO. Personnel deployment
          eligibility will be constantly monitored by UDMs to ensure required deployment
          positions can be filled by qualified individuals at all times.
          3.23.2.5.4. Units will attempt, as early as possible, to identify potential personnel
          eligibility problems in order to allow the PDF maximum time to try to find qualified
          personnel from installation/wing resources.
              3.23.2.5.4.1. If qualified personnel are not available on the installation, notify the
              DCC so they can elevate the requirement to higher headquarters and/or
              AFPC/DPW.
              3.23.2.5.4.2. In many cases, commanders can waive eligibility factor problems.
              3.23.2.5.4.3. When they cannot waive them, commanders will elevate those
              personnel issues or shortfall IAW applicable reclama and shortfall implementing
              guidance.
3.24. Tasking, Requirement, and Movement Validation/Verification.
   3.24.1. The tasking verification process for crisis response surge operations will follow the
   same procedures as identified in AFI 10-401, Chapter 8 with the following exceptions:
   3.24.2. IDRC becomes the DCC, and any additional deployment workcenter personnel
   required by the IDO are notified that the DCC has been activated.

  3.24.5. Movement Flow Schedule.
      3.24.5.1. The DCC will coordinate with its MAJCOM, supported component
      headquarters and TACC concerning airlift.
      3.24.5.2. The supported CCDR will coordinate movement with USTRANSCOM during
      crisis action.
      3.24.5.3. For visibility of airflow, the DCC will access DCAPES, IGC, Global Decision
      Support System (GDSS), and/or Single Mobility System (SMS).
      3.24.5.4. A designated POC in each work center will provide status of deployment issues
      to the IDO, who is responsible for status reporting to the CAT. Also, POCs will report
      LIMFAC/shortfalls status. Schedule screens, status boards, and other electronic media
      are helpful management tools for tracking deployment status.
      3.24.5.5. Due to dynamic situations, taskings and priorities will probably change daily,
      or even hourly.
         3.24.5.5.1. Beddown sites, number and type of aircraft required, aircraft
         configurations, and so on, can cause extensive changes to unit deployment efforts.
         3.24.5.5.2. In addition, DPW or MAJCOM FAMs could determine that a particular
         unit tasking has higher priorities than others.
         3.24.5.5.3. Units will monitor the situation closely and tailor their actions to reflect
         any changes in priorities.
3.25. LOGMOD Schedule.
  3.25.1. The LOGMOD Schedule is the authoritative document within the wing that
  orchestrates the movement of cargo and personnel (see Chapters 4 and 5 for specific cargo
  and personnel processing procedures, respectively). Accuracy must be carefully ensured.
  3.25.2. Reference AFPAM 10-1403, Air Mobility Planning Factors, the LOGMOD Users
  Guide, system help files, and sample schedules with recommended event times for more
  detailed information.
  3.25.3. Prioritizing and Monitoring Movement Outflow.
      3.25.3.1. The IDO is responsible for managing the outflow of cargo and personnel based
      on these guidelines:
      3.25.3.2. The IDO will create the schedule to flow through the installation deployment
      process based on the Supported Command TPFDD RDD movement priority of
      equipment and/or personnel, strategic airlift arrival/departure times and aggregate
      transportation requirements. The schedule and initial aircraft load plans will be developed
      concurrently to ensure efficiency.
      3.25.3.3. Units will prioritize equipment and personnel to the UTC increment and
      personnel line number detail based on the Supported Command TPFDD RDDs.
      Reference AFI 10-401 for prioritizing UTCs.

Section 4B—Equipment Management

4.2. Authorized Equipment.
   4.2.1. UTCs will only be filled with equipment assigned to the tasked unit.
       4.2.1.1. Exceptions to this policy require a waiver IAW AFI 10-401.
       4.2.1.2. Fragmentation could occur where one unit provides the manpower requirement
       and another provides the equipment, or if one unit provides manning augmentation to
       another unit.
       4.2.1.3. Typically, fragmenting UTC records will only be allowed in cases where the two
       units are formally linked in DOC statements or other functional area documents.
   4.2.2. No authorization will be counted against more than one UTC record unless a waiver is
   granted by USAF/A5XW (e.g. USSTRATCOM supported UTCs). Additionally, each UTC
   record will be placed into only one AEF Capability Library per cycle.
   4.2.3. If a unit can no longer support a postured UTC, the unit must coordinate with the
   respective MAJCOM war planner and FAM.
   4.2.4. Personnel in deployable UTCs must be equipped or have access to equipment to

   available for deployment.
   4.4.4. AFPC/DPW will nominate equipment-only UTCs from the installations in the on-call
   AEF deployment window as identified by the ECS SIPT-approved Target Base Alignment
   Template.
   4.4.5. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) UTCs will be sourced irrespective of on-call AEF
   deployment window.
   4.4.6. Once sourced, and at the direction of the parent MAJCOM, units/wings will
   electronically pass their equipment (DCAPES Plan export) information to their MAJCOM
   FAM via SIPR. Units/Wings must indicate ULN data and whether the equipment detail is
   from a UTC that contains both equipment and personnel or an equipment-only UTC. NOTE:
   Refer to AFI 10-401, Chapter 10 for tailoring guidance.
   4.4.7. Use of WRM is restricted to ensure sufficient capability is available to support theater
   starter or swing stock requirements.

          4.8.2.3.1. TCN (Transportation Control Number) with embedded ULN (up to the full
          seven digits).
          4.8.2.3.2. Origin (to include Stock Record Account Number/DOD Account Activity
          Code (SRAN/DODAAC)).
          4.8.2.3.3. APOE.
          4.8.2.3.4. APOD, Destination (to include SRAN/DODAAC).
          4.8.2.3.5. Cube.
          4.8.2.3.6. Dimensions.
          4.8.2.3.7. Weight.
          4.8.2.3.8. Unit POC.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                        139


  4.8.3. Whenever possible MSLs should be produced from an automatic system so that linear
  or 2D barcodes are shown for the TCN, destination/consignee, and piece number blocks so
  automatic identification technology can be used to process unit move shipments through the
  terminals expeditiously.
  4.8.4. Temporary LOGMOD deployment shipping placards will be used by UDMs for
  shipment/equipment identification purposes from the deploying unit to the CDF to facilitate
  the in-check process for deployments, exercises, and unit moves. Deploying force/owning
  unit is required to produce and place pallet placards on two adjacent sides of a pallet IAW
  DTR 4500.9-R, Part III.
     4.8.4.1. UDMs may produce manual DD Form 1387s in place of LOGMOD placards
     during periods of LOGMOD inoperability.
     4.8.4.2. Currently LOGMOD deployment shipping placards do not meet DTR
     requirements (bar coding) and therefore cannot be used for actual deployments, exercises,
     or unit moves.
  4.8.5. The CDF will produce a CMOS/GATES MSL after the joint inspection (JI) to ensure
  accurate weight and dimensional data.
         4.8.5.1. If CMOS/GATES is not available to produce authorized MSLs, then the
         CDF/units will manually complete a DD Form 1387 IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Part III,
         MIL-STD-129P and/or AFI 24-203, utilizing the Logistics Web Forms Processor
         (LWFP): https://lsotools.wpafb.af.mil.
         4.8.5.2. Units are responsible for producing an automated or manual load and
         packing lists for all deploying UTC cargo (e.g. palletized, rolling-stock, hand-carried
         and/or floor-loaded) IAW the LOGMOD Schedule.
         4.8.5.3. If a DD Form 1387 is utilized, ensure blocks 1, 9, and 16 are legible for
         down line stations to update the advance movement data file and produce updated
         automated MSLs with bar codes, if capable.
         4.8.5.4. CDF/units will place labels in a waterproof envelope and securely attach the
         envelope to the deploying increment.
         4.8.5.5. If LWFP is used, users will generate TCMDs and MSLs for shippers. This
         web-based system includes electronic versions of DD Form 1384s and DD Form
         1387s. The system also includes data validation for all shipment types and sends
         advanced warning to POEs.
  4.8.6. Load and Packing Lists.
     4.8.6.1. LOGMOD is the source system for generating Deployment Cargo Load and
     Packing lists.
     4.8.6.2. If LOGMOD is not available or functional for the purpose of generating these
     products, an AF Form 2518, Deployment Packing List, will be manually generated (see
     Attachment 14).
     4.8.6.3. Items loaded onto increments (containers onto pallets or rolling-stock) will be
     marked/stenciled in a waterproof manner. Minimum markings will consist of:
140                                          AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


         4.8.6.3.1. Line One: UTC/Unit of assignment (e.g. 890 FS).
         4.8.6.3.2. Line Two: Deployment echelon/Increment number/Item number (e.g. C1-
         1004-01).
         4.8.6.3.3. Apply packing/shipping markings and labels IAW equipment technical
         orders. Additional unit markings are authorized.
      4.8.6.4. Load and Packing lists must be accurate and be attached in weatherproof pouch
      with the pallet/container.
      4.8.6.5. Accurate load and packing lists are critical to ensure unit equipment is not
      delayed by customs at entry into other countries.
      4.8.6.6. Failure by units to create accurate documentation can delay equipment arrival to
      the beddown location and seriously affect the mission.
      4.8.6.7. Pen and ink changes are authorized.
      4.8.6.8. All containers (except as otherwise identified herein) will have a LOGMOD
      packing list affixed with detailed list of all suffixed items within the container.
      4.8.6.9. When a suffixed item in the container is a container itself with more than one
      item, the inside container will additionally have an AF Form 2518 attached.
      4.8.6.10. Locally developed electronic forms are authorized if they include, as a
      minimum, the same data fields as the AF Form 2518.
      4.8.6.11. Medical units will use Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS)
      packing lists and logistics readiness units may use SBSS listings (R-43, etc.) for Mobility
      Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) packing lists.
      4.8.6.12. Civil Engineer units will use Equipment and Supply Listing (ESL).
         4.8.6.12.1. Standard configuration for equipment is identified in the ESL.         The
         contents of individual kits are further defined in the ESL.
         4.8.6.12.2. Printed copies of pertinent ESL information will be placed on or within
         individual kits.
      4.8.6.13. Units will not use manual Deployment Load and Packing lists except under the
      most unusual of circumstances (i.e. LOGMOD system failure).
      4.8.6.14. The packing list, (ESL for CE only), will contain the contents (suffix items) for
      items identified as containers and include NSN, nomenclature, tasked quantities,
      hazard/special handling indicator codes, sensitive/controlled items, and ASCs of suffix
      items. The following exceptions apply:
         4.8.6.14.1. Do not list contents for MRSP except those that are hazardous or Use
         Code “A” (Allowance Standard asset).
         4.8.6.14.2. Do not list the contents for Consolidated Tool Kits (CTKs) except those
         that are hazardous or Use Code “A.”
         4.8.6.14.3. Do not list miscellaneous administrative supplies (pens, pencils, paper,
         etc.) except those that are hazardous or Use Code “A”.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                             141


          4.8.6.14.4. Do not list medical supplies except those that are hazardous or Use Code
          “A” (EXCEPTION: Medical UTCs will list medical supplies).
          4.8.6.14.5. Do not list individual CE kits except those that are hazardous or Use Code
          “A”.
       4.8.6.15. LOGMOD is not designed for making frequent changes to fluctuating
       quantities of such expendables as pencils, forms, hand tools, or narcotics.
       4.8.6.16. Inventory and Deployment Packing lists for CTKs and miscellaneous
       administrative supplies are the responsibilities of the owning unit.
       4.8.6.17. Units will maintain shoring material for the unit’s equipment and identify this
       material within their load and packing lists to account for the additional weight of this
       material.
   4.8.7. Pallet Identifiers (DD Form 2775/automated equivalents). Deploying force and/or
   owning unit is only required to produce and place the pallet identifiers on two adjacent sides
   of a pallet IAW DTR4500.9-R, Part III when multiple TCNs are consolidated on a pallet,
   ISU, etc. for shipment. A pallet identifier is optional for shipments containing a single TCN
   as the MSL has all data related to the shipment.
   4.8.8. Deployment Transportation Control Number (TCN).
       4.8.8.1. If LOGMOD is not operational, the deployment TCN can be manually
       constructed by following instructions in DTR 4500.9-R, Part III, Appendix H.
       4.8.8.2. The TCN will include the ULN (use full seven-digit ULN when fragmented),
       Deployment echelon, and increment number (automatically generated in LOGMOD
       Schedule module).
   4.8.9. For contingency exercises and deployments, include:
       4.8.9.1. DD Form 1387-2, Special Handling Data/Certification (for cargo requiring any
       special handling instructions e.g. classified, sensitive, keep away from magnetized
       material, etc)
       4.8.9.2. Commercial bills of lading; and a truck manifest (TCMD data.
       4.8.9.3. DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest, or equivalent), prepared by the transportation
       function or deploying unit, as appropriate.
       4.8.9.4. Cargo that is both sensitive and hazardous (such as small arms ammunition)
       requires a Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods and a completed DD Form 1387-2.
       4.8.9.5. During an actual deployment or contingency, the deploying unit must complete
       an original Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods to certify all hazardous cargo (see
       AFMAN 24-204[I] for more details).
       4.8.9.6. DELETED
4.9. Pallet Build-up.
   4.9.1. Pallet profile for all aircraft (e.g. C-130, KC-10, and Civil Reserve Airlift Fleet (CRAF))
   will be considered when preparing cargo pallets. This may significantly reduce the possibility of
 142                                           AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


   further modifications at the time of actual loading. Use the checklist in DTR 4500.9-R, Part III,
   Appendix O: http://www.transcom.mil/j5/pt/dtrpart3/dtr_part_iii_app_o.pdf.
   4.9.2. Palletize Baggage.
       4.9.2.1. For planning purposes, baggage will be palletized for all C-5 aircraft, 10 or more
       passengers on a KC-10 aircraft, and 20 or more passengers on all other airframes.
       4.9.2.2. C-17 baggage pallets will be loaded in the rear of the aircraft while KC-10 and
       KC-135 baggage pallets will be loaded towards the nose in order to expedite the
       download at the final destination.
       4.9.2.3. Baggage pallets will follow the same height and contour restrictions as other
       pallets.
       4.9.2.4. When 20 or more passengers are on a chalk, load planners must account for
       baggage pallets on the pre-load plan by using canned weights/heights (2500lbs/45) and
       the LOGMOD Scheduler will account for pallets in the LOGMOD schedule remarks
       section.
   4.9.3. Units deploying or redeploying are responsible for all cargo preparation to include
   providing special equipment operators, venting liquid oxygen (LOX) carts, providing de-icer
   drivers, etc. NOTE: Deploying units are required to install appropriate vent kit to the
   equipment. Aircraft maintenance will then connect to aircraft venting system.
   4.9.4. Any required shoring/dunnage will be provided by the unit and must be deployed with
   its associated equipment/pallet.
       4.9.4.1. Pallet dunnage will always accompany 463L pallets during movement.
       4.9.4.2. The following are general movement characteristics for pallet dunnage:
          4.9.4.2.1. Length: 88 inches.
          4.9.4.2.2. Width/height: 3 inches.
          4.9.4.2.3. Quantity: 3 each.
       4.9.4.3. Dunnage NSN information can be obtained from the IDO, Transportation
       Management personnel, AFI 10-401, or by using the Federal Logistics (FEDLOG)
       system.
4.10. Pre-deployment Cargo Movement.
   4.10.1. Cargo movement requirements/responsibilities will be documented in the local IDP.
   4.10.2. Deploying units will deliver all UTC cargo (e.g. palletized, rolling-stock, hand-
   carried, and/or floor-loaded) to the CDF in-check area as required by the LOGMOD
   Schedule.
   4.10.3. Units must arrange movement of cargo well in advance of required LOGMOD
   Schedule processing times to ensure on-time processing and availability of transportation
   assets.
       4.10.3.1. If required, units should first contact the DCC Transportation Representative.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                       143


      4.10.3.2. If required, and the DCC has not been activated, the unit should contact LRS
      Vehicle Management Flight to request support moving non-rolling stock cargo.
   4.10.4. Deploying non-local AF and non-AF units will:
      4.10.4.1. Provide a CD-ROM in electronic format (CMOS/GATES/Transportation
      Coordinators-Automated Information for Movements System II (TC-AIMS II), or new
      generation system) containing outbound air cargo information to the CDF, Aircraft
      Services, or Cargo Processing Section IAW published times contained in local
      LOGMOD Schedule to expedite processing of cargo into the airlift system.
      4.10.4.2. Provide approved electronic media with deploying passenger data to the PDF
      for input into IDS systems (CMOS/GATES) for manifest preparation, (Reference AFI
      24-203 for further guidance).
      4.10.4.3. DELETED
          4.10.4.3.1. DELETED
             4.10.4.3.1.1. DELETED
             4.10.4.3.1.2. DELETED
4.11. Cargo Processing.
   4.11.1. The CDF will:
      4.11.1.1. Be a controlled area and have the capability to weigh and measure equipment.
      EXCEPTION: For locations that have contracted Air Terminal Ground Handling
      Services (ATGHS), the IDP will capture these unique service contract relationships for
      Air Terminal Operations, JI and aircraft loading. Further, a copy will be sent the
      MAJCOM/A4s for transparency and consolidation.
      4.11.1.2. Determine and comply with any special requirements or procedures that will be
      required to inspect explosives (e.g. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)/SF loads usually
      require a separate holding area or “hot cargo pad” for meeting all safety requirements).
      4.11.1.3. Identify personnel to perform any “mobile” in-check requirements and ensure
      enough materials are available.
      4.11.1.4. Coordinate commercial surface movement through the LRS/Deployment and
      Distribution Flight and LRS Deployment & Distribution Flight Commander. NOTE: For
      AMC bases with an APS, the CDF is the responsibility of the APS.
      4.11.1.5. Make augmentees aware of hazards such as LOX carts and explosives.
      4.11.1.6. In-check, weigh and measure hand-carried and/or floor-loaded UTC cargo in
      the same manner as palletized or rolling-stock cargo. Upon completion of cargo
      processing and deemed safe, hand-carried cargo will be released to the deploying unit
      representative (e.g. cargo courier) for transportation loading IAW the LOGMOD
      Schedule.
   4.11.2. Cargo Marshaling.
      4.11.2.1. Marshaling is the orderly assembly of cargo (in load plan sequence by chalk, in
      preparation for JI) to a location called the staging or call forward area.
144                                           AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


      4.11.2.2. Identify these locations as sterile areas to ensure the equipment is not
      “tampered” with (adding or deleting pieces).
      4.11.2.3. The CDF controls entry into the marshaling yard.
      4.11.2.4. Identify these areas in the IDP.
  4.11.3. Joint Inspection (JI) of Cargo.
      4.11.3.1. JI is the final inspection with the owning unit and the joint inspector (or
      loadmaster, if necessary) before the load is accepted.
      4.11.3.2. The JI is accomplished IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Part III.
      4.11.3.3. If an item is not properly prepared or documentation is incorrect, it will be
      placed in the frustrated cargo area and the CDF OIC/NCOICs are notified immediately so
      that corrective actions will be taken.
      4.11.3.4. Ensure keys and combinations accompany cargo to in-check. Lack of keys or
      combinations will cause cargo to be frustrated.
      4.11.3.5. After the JI process is complete, equipment is ready for loading. In the event of
      discrepancies discovered after the JI is complete, ensure the CDF OIC/NCOIC is
      immediately notified to ensure an experienced unit representative is dispatched to remedy
      the discrepancy.
      4.11.3.6. Each unit will also have a representative (increment monitor) accompany the
      equipment to the in-check area that is familiar with the increment cargo to resolve
      discrepancies or at least communicate requirements to appropriate unit personnel until
      their cargo clears the JI. The tasked unit must have a team ready (quick-fix team) to
      immediately respond to resolve any discrepancies frustrating the cargo.
  4.11.4. Frustrated Cargo.
      4.11.4.1. Frustrated cargo is cargo that failed the CDF inspection at the in-check area,
      joint inspection, or any place after arriving the CDF and prior to loading the aircraft.
      4.11.4.2. Frustrated cargo will be set aside in a frustrated cargo area (within the CDF)
      until the owning unit replaces and/or fixes the assets.
      4.11.4.3. CDF will notify the DCC immediately of all frustrated cargo, so proper
      action(s) can be taken to resolve problems.
      4.11.4.4. Cargo frustration times are tracked to ensure issues are corrected as quickly as
      possible.
      4.11.4.5. Reliable communications between the DCC, CDF, and UDMs (to include
      quick-fix teams) is critical because failure to fix a frustrated piece of cargo in a timely
      manner can delay an entire deployment schedule and affect a unit’s overall capability.
      4.11.4.6. The IDP will identify a frustrated cargo holding area in the CDF for increments
      having discrepancies (documentation or improper preparation).
  4.11.5. Cargo Manifesting.
      4.11.5.1. Cargo manifests will be prepared for each chalk to ensure ITV from point of
      origin to final destination.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                         145


          4.11.5.1.1. Individuals assigned to this function will be extremely knowledgeable of
          the requirements of DTR 4500.9-R, Part II and AFI 24-203.
          4.11.5.1.2. Cargo load plans cannot be used as cargo manifests. Hand-carried and/or
          floor-loaded UTC cargo will be manifested in the same manner as palletized or
          rolling-stock cargo.
      4.11.5.2. CMOS or GATES will be used to generate the cargo manifest.
          4.11.5.2.1. If CMOS/GATES is not available to produce the cargo manifest, a DD
          Form 1385, Cargo Manifest, is used.
          4.11.5.2.2. Fax or email DD Form 1385 to AMC Data Processing Center
          (ORG.AMCA4-70@us.af.mil) for ITV purposes.
          4.11.5.2.3. UDMs are required to ensure TCMD data (e.g. transportation trailer data
          for HAZMAT, sensitive, classified, etc.) is accurate and meets DTR 4500.9-R, Part
          III requirements, and loaded in LOGMOD. For assistance with TCMD data,
          LRS/APS/AMS transportation specialists are the primary points of contact at the
          installation/wing level.
          4.11.5.2.4. Cargo information will transfer from LOGMOD to CMOS/GATES to
          IGC for ITV.
          4.11.5.2.5. CMOS/GATES manifest printout will accompany manifested cargo.

Section 4D—Load Plan Preparation

4.12. Load Plan Preparation.
   4.12.1. Load planners will use load planning IDS systems to prepare load plans. However,
   proficiency in using manual load planning methods must be maintained in the event the load
   planning system is not available.
   4.12.2. Pre- or initial load plans will be developed simultaneously with the LOGMOD
   Schedule to ensure proper sequencing of equipment and passengers based on TPFDD timing,
   UTC priority flow, en route support, and force/equipment mix needed in order to achieve
   initial operating capability at the beddown location as soon as possible.
   4.12.3. Coordinate with the DCC before moving a piece of equipment/cargo from one load
   to another to ensure the move will not affect either en route support or operations at the
   beddown location.
   4.12.4. Ensure that cargo, personnel, aircraft, and load plan destinations are the same. Units
   will coordinate with logistics planners to ensure prioritization of cargo to meet the mission
   requirements at the deployed location.
   4.12.5. Avoid placing all critical initial operating support equipment and personnel on the
   same aircraft/mode of transportation to prevent loss of capability if the mode is delayed or
   destroyed.
   4.12.6. Increments within a single UTC that is too small to be palletized individually will be
   combined with other increments into the same UTC to reduce airlift requirements.
146                                           AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


      4.12.6.1. When combined, the unit will notify and coordinate with the DCC to designate
      a lead POC for processing the equipment.
      4.12.6.2. The DCC Scheduler will annotate the combined increments in the LOGMOD
      Schedule Remarks Field and any coordinating modifications with the load planners.
      4.12.6.3. Increments from different UTCs should not be combined unless ITV is
      achievable. If UTCs must be combined into single increments in LOGMOD, ITV will
      not be lost if the following steps are followed:
         4.12.6.3.1. Use the Chalk Remarks block on the LOGMOD Schedule, for the
         specified chalk, to reflect combined UTC Increments.
         4.12.6.3.2. Use the Chalk Remarks block to identify the lead increment (i.e. TCN)
         for all of the increments that have been combined and what deploying unit is overall
         responsible for packaging and generating deployment products for that lead
         increment.
         4.12.6.3.3. CMOS/GATES operators will use the LOGMOD Schedule Chalk
         Remarks field, for the specified chalk, to consolidate the combined UTC increments
         under a tab pallet header (capped pallet).
         4.12.6.3.4. Even though CMOS/GATES will reflect a lead TCN, all of the combined
         increments (i.e. subsidiary TCNs) will be associated to the lead TCN and will be
         visible in IGC.
         4.12.6.3.5. When physically combining increments of cargo, copies of the load lists,
         for each of the increments that are being combined, must be placed on the outside of
         the lead Increment. This allows CDF personnel to have access to all load list
         information at the time of JI/In-check.
         4.12.6.3.6. The lead increment load list will be placed on the outside of the increment
         packing envelope as to be the first document pulled by the CDF in-checker. This lead
         increment load list must be annotated to reflect the overall combined increment
         weights and dimensions. Pen and ink changes are authorized.
         4.12.6.3.7. The same procedures apply for Deployment Shipping Placards for
         combined increments.
  4.12.7. Load Plan Distribution.
      4.12.7.1. Once the final load plans are accomplished, load planners ensure all essential
      players receive them. The following people and agencies will receive the following
      number of copies of load plans:
         4.12.7.1.1. Aircraft commander (1-original).
         4.12.7.1.2. Load team chief (1).
         4.12.7.1.3. DCC (1).
         4.12.7.1.4. Station file copy (1).
         4.12.7.1.5. RAMPCO (1), if applicable.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                           147


      4.12.7.2. The load plan is NOT the same as the cargo manifest. The Cargo Manifest
      (DD Form 1385) or its automated equivalent is the official manifest IAW DTR 4500.9-R,
      Part II.

Section 4E—Aircraft/Cargo Loading

4.13. Aircraft/Cargo Loading.
   4.13.1. The Cargo Deployment Function. Loads unit equipment and baggage. For specific
   guidance on how to load aircraft, consult DTR 4500.9-R, Part III, and the applicable aircraft -
   9 Technical Order (TO).
      4.13.1.1. Load team chiefs will ensure all team members are familiar with the load plan
      and everyone on the team understands their specific responsibilities. Load team chiefs
      will check with the RAMPCO or OIC/NCOIC of the CDF if a load plan is not available
      at least 45 minutes before LOGMOD Schedule load start time. NOTE: Report load start
      and completion times to the DCC immediately.
      4.13.1.2. All cargo will be ready to load NLT 30 minutes before scheduled load start
      time or as spelled out in the IDP.
      4.13.1.3. Each load team will consist of a team chief and at least three handlers or
      operators. At the beginning of the shift, the team chief will conduct a safety briefing
      covering at least the following:
          4.13.1.3.1. Safe operation of MHE (e.g. speed limits, use of chocks, and need for
          spotters).
          4.13.1.3.2. Safe cargo handling (pallets pushed – not pulled, etc.).
          4.13.1.3.3. Safety equipment for all load team members, e.g. safety-toed work boots,
          gloves, reflective gear, light wands for hours of darkness, etc.
          4.13.1.3.4. Safety procedures during Engine-Running On/Offloads (EROs) and
          concurrent refueling (if applicable). NOTE: See T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing
          of Aircraft & Static Grounding/Bonding, for more details on concurrent servicing
          operations.
      4.13.1.4. The deploying unit will furnish drivers for specialized equipment/vehicles (e.g.
      Rescue all-terrain transports (RATTs), all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), M-series vehicles,
      etc.). These drivers will load specialized equipment under the supervision of the
      loadmaster.
      4.13.1.5. The load team chief will follow safe loading procedures at all times, as well as
      ensure:
          4.13.1.5.1. Cargo is identified and segregated into loads according to the LOGMOD
          Schedule.
          4.13.1.5.2. The team has sufficient serviceable MHE to perform loading operations.
          4.13.1.5.3. The team loads the aircraft or vehicle according to the final load plan or at
          the direction of the aircraft commander or designated representative.
 148                                           AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


          4.13.1.5.4. Cargo is visually checked for obvious leaks and discrepancies before
          loading. Notify the RAMPCO of any problems so corrective action can be taken.
          4.13.1.5.5. The loadmaster is briefed on the load configuration and special loading
          requirements. Have the team load the aircraft under the loadmaster's supervision.
          4.13.1.5.6. Cargo is properly loaded onto trucks with adequate tie-down, as directed
          by the vehicle operator. All items planned for the truck are loaded.
   4.13.2. Aircraft Loadmaster Briefing. The RAMPCO or load team chief will deliver
   deployment manifests and brief the Aircraft Loadmaster on the specifics of the load to
   include all hazardous material before loading.
   4.13.3. Ramp Coordinator (RAMPCO).
       4.13.3.1. Oversees and coordinates all aircraft and vehicle loading operations as outlined
       in the LOGMOD Schedule and works closely with the CDF and PDF to ensure all facets
       of airlift support are met. The RAMPCO acts as the eyes and ears of the CDF and,
       therefore, must closely monitor all aircraft ground handling operations while maintaining
       constant communication with the CDF and/or Air Terminal Operations Center (ATOC).
       4.13.3.2. Will carefully monitor their assigned loads from marshaling complete time
       until the aircraft or truck departs.
       4.13.3.3. At a minimum, visually check their load for any obvious discrepancies (leaks,
       missing placards, weights, etc.) prior to aircraft loading. In addition, they will be familiar
       with all the characteristics of the load (HAZMAT, documentation requirements, required
       waivers, etc.).

Section 4F—Intransit Visibility

4.14. In-Transit Visibility (ITV).
   4.14.1. Use of AF automated systems that comprise the IDS to deploy AF forces is
   mandatory. IDS components include LOGMOD, DCAPES, CMOS, GATES and ICODES.
   To achieve deployment ITV, pass cargo and passenger deployment files from LOGMOD and
   DCAPES (or other Service systems) to CMOS or GATES, which, in turn, pass movement
   data to IGC. Further guidance on the use of CMOS can be found in AFI 24-203, Chapter 15,
   and online at https://www.gunter.af.mil/il/ilr/ilrc.
   4.14.2. The IDO ensures cargo and passenger data is accurately entered into IDS
   components to maintain ITV within established time frames. Without exception, valid and
   full 7-character (if fragmented) ULNs from the applicable CCDR’s TPFDD are required for
   deployment cargo and personnel in order to relate these resources back to the force
   requirements in the TPFDD. Fictitiously entered ULNs will prevent cross-referencing this
   data back to the TPFDD (AFI 24-203, Chapter 18). Ensure CMOS/GATES operators
   transmit passenger and cargo manifest information to IGC NLT one hour after chalk
   departure for contingency and unit move deployments.
   4.14.3. ITV provides visibility of deploying cargo and personnel from home station, or
   origin, to destination.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                         149


     4.14.3.1. Supported/Supporting commanders use ITV to track the flow of capabilities
     and critical assets (e.g. munitions) from origin into an area of operations (AO).
     4.14.3.2. Transportation closure, as indicated by ITV, is critical as a gauge to predict
     when capabilities are in place to commence operations.
     4.14.3.3. Force closure cannot be ascertained through ITV alone. Only the deployed
     commander can declare force closure and operational capability (i.e. the force is ready to
     commence operations).
  4.14.4. IDS must be used to support the deployment process and enable/achieve ITV.
  CMOS/GATES houses aircraft manifest information; therefore, CD-ROMs will no longer be
  required to accompany missions to facilitate re-manifesting or continuation of ITV at en
  route and trans-load locations.
     4.14.4.1. CMOS/GATES users must pass the movement data, with valid ULNs, to IGC.
     4.14.4.2. CMOS training material is available via: https://www.gunter.af.mil/il/ilr/ilrc
     and GATES training material is available via: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/gates.
  4.14.5. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Tags.
     4.14.5.1. RFID tags are required for deploying cargo.
     4.14.5.2. The LRS designated transportation function will burn unit tags using shipment
     data imported to CMOS (GATES for CONUS AMC strategic aerial ports) from
     LOGMOD and ensure tags are attached to all end items before aircraft loading
     commences.
     4.14.5.3. IAW AFI 24-203, Deployment and Distribution Flights will order and maintain
     sufficient tags to support local exercise requirements as determined by the IDO.
         4.14.5.3.1. Tags will be ordered through base supply.
         4.14.5.3.2. The current tag is stock listed as Model 654 with 128KB RAM (NSN
         6350-01-532-1998); however, units will validate the current tag model/NSN with
         their respective MAJCOMs prior to ordering.
         4.14.5.3.3. Installations will order tags to support unit deployments from the central
         repository maintained by the AF automatic information technology (AIT) program
         management office (PMO) using the following procedures:
         4.14.5.3.4. Determine total tag requirement for deployments.
         4.14.5.3.5. Order tags no earlier than 45 calendar days prior to the projected
         deployment date. Request tags from 403 SCMS/GUEA, DSN: 787-7297, and/or
         Commercial: (937) 257-7297.
     4.14.5.4. Account for RFID tags during deployment planning and execution.
     4.14.5.5. Ensure adequate time is built into the LOGMOD Schedule to allow tags to be
     properly affixed to deploying cargo at the CDF.
     4.14.5.6. Installations/wings will establish local procedures to receive, store and maintain
     tags received at origin.

                                         Chapter 5

                      DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION (PERSONNEL)

Section 5A—General.

5.1. General.
   5.1.1. This chapter provides information concerning the processing of personnel, for pre-
   planning and execution, and the processing activities supporting the personnel deployment
   process.
   5.1.2. The DRMD; generated by DCAPES, dictates the personnel taskings the unit must be
   prepared to fill for a deployment and is an essential element of the Personnel and Manpower
   communities supporting total force accountability.

Section 5B—Personnel Deployment Planning/Execution

5.2. Personnel Authorizations.
   5.2.1. Postured UTCs will only be filled with authorizations from one unit (i.e. not
   fragmented). See AFI 10-401, Chapter 4, for exceptions and waiver procedures.
   5.2.2. Personnel in deployable UTCs must be trained and equipped, or have access to
   equipment, to maintain UTC capability. NOTE: ART must be updated to reflect status of
   personnel and equipment for each standard deployable UTC IAW AFI 10-244. This includes
   UTCs identified for home station or in-place UTCs.
   5.2.3. Personnel will be assigned to postured UTCs IAW AFI 10-401, Chapter 7.
       5.2.3.1. DELETED
       5.2.3.2. DELETED
5.3. AF Personnel Deployment Planning/Execution Concept.
   5.3.1. AF unit deployments normally occur after a Movement Day (C-Day) is established.
       5.3.1.1. AMC’s Global Mobility Task Force as well as some other forces may move well
       before C-Day.
       5.3.1.2. Since planning assumptions, response options, and mobilization timing vary
       depending on the execution scenario, units may not move as a single UTC entity.
       5.3.1.3. Transportation constraints, reception capabilities and operational concepts
       dictate the final closure rate of the deploying force to the destination.
   5.3.2. Deployment Tasking Requirements.
       5.3.2.1. The DRMD provides the MAJCOM, supported component headquarters and
       wings the consolidated UTC personnel taskings for a particular deployment supporting
       ROMO and exercises requirements.
       5.3.2.2. AFI 36-3802 gives specific details on the data elements of the DRMD.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                     151


   5.3.3. Deployment Manning Requirements (DMR) will be transmitted to the base from the
   supported component command through the owning MAJCOM.
      5.3.3.1. MAJCOM FAMs will ensure IDRCs are informed of wing AEF sourcing
      utilizing DCAPES TNT.
      5.3.3.2. For ANG Wings, the IPR is responsible for the wing AEF sourcing and
      verification process.
      5.3.3.3. The DMR is the (space) to the personnel (face) that is generated to complete a
      DRMD.
   5.3.4. The DRMD has nine key and essential pieces of personnel deployment tasking
   information:
      5.3.4.1. PID.
      5.3.4.2. ULN, ULN position number.
      5.3.4.3. Position number suffix.
      5.3.4.4. AFSC.
      5.3.4.5. Unique qualifications (e.g. line remarks).
      5.3.4.6. Tasked PAS.
      5.3.4.7. RDD.
      5.3.4.8. Duty Location (DLOC).
      5.3.4.9. Attached PAS.
   5.3.5. DRMDs will be transmitted to the base from the MAJCOM AEF Cell using DCAPES
   TNT to the sourced installation/wing’s IDRC/DCC.
      5.3.5.1. The baseline process is that the OPLAN requirements are loaded in DCAPES.
      Before exporting plan data from DCAPES for input into other parts of the IDS system,
      the DCAPES operator uses published declassification procedures and software to ensure
      only unclassified data is passed from the classified system.
      5.3.5.2. The IDRC and tasked units review the key and essential pieces of the personnel
      deployment tasking and determine the proper course of actions (e.g. activating the wing
      deployment process).
      5.3.5.3. Tailoring and modifying the DRMD is managed IAW AFI 10-401, Chapter 10
      and AFI 38-205. Once this is complete, the unit must assign personnel to support the
      requirement. The UTC identifies the specific requirements including the AFSC, SEIs,
      security clearances, and grade needed by personnel selected to fulfill the tasking.
5.4. Matching (Assigning) Personnel to Requirements.
   5.4.1. Commanders will:
      5.4.1.1. Ensure personnel have their affairs in order.
      5.4.1.2. Have an AFDF which contains required deployment documentation.
      5.4.1.3. Ensure AFDFs are on file and maintained by the UDM.
152                                        AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


  5.4.2. IDRC Personnel and Manpower representative(s) will identify requirements by unit in
  order to facilitate distribution to the appropriate UDMs for fill actions. After all the
  requirements are received and reviewed, they will be made available to the tasked units.
  5.4.3. The unit is responsible for assigning a name for each requirement on the DRMD NLT
  the time required by AF guidance or as dictated by the IDO in order to meet the LOGMOD
  Schedule. (See Attachment 4 for flowchart of personnel processing process)
  5.4.4. Before an individual can be deployed, he or she must meet the training and
  deployment eligibility requirements according to this instruction, AFI 36-2110, and the UTC
  MISCAP statement.
  5.4.5. The MilPDS has a series of business rules identifying to unit commanders
  questionable deployment eligibility called DAV codes.
      5.4.5.1. Some DAV codes place a person into a questionable deployment availability
      status.
      5.4.5.2. Attachment 2 of this instruction explains all DAV codes affecting the
      deployment process.
  5.4.6. The IDRC and PDF will:
      5.4.6.1. Advise commanders when personnel are ineligible for deployment according to
      the governing directives.
      5.4.6.2. Ensure documentation is correct on personnel with waiverable DAV and duty
      status codes.
      5.4.6.3. Ensure DAV Code waiver requests are submitted to the appropriate policy
      owner or authority; i.e. legal, medical, personnel, etc.
      5.4.6.4. The use of IDS helps commanders in the unit deployment selection process by
      automating eligibility and waiver status of personnel.
  5.4.7. LOGMOD works with a Personnel file that is a snapshot in time of MilPDS, so some
  DAV/duty status codes might not apply. In these instances, close coordination between the
  unit and IPR/PDF must occur to ensure data systems reflect the proper status.
  5.4.8. Immediately upon receipt of the tasking, the UDM will notify the unit commander and
  accomplish the following:
      5.4.8.1. When a tasking is received by a unit, if the SSN is not filled in, then the
      commander identifies, tasks, and notifies the UDM with the name/SSN of deploying
      personnel.
      5.4.8.2. If the tasking is a non-unit postured UTC, the UDM will solicit names from the
      section/flight chief(s) and submit the name(s) for commander approval.
         5.4.8.2.1. Line and command remarks still must be met.
         5.4.8.2.2. UDMs will review AFDFs and other data sources to ensure selected
         personnel meet all requirements.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                        153


         5.4.8.2.3. UDMs will recommend selected personnel to fill taskings who have not
         completed all necessary requirements, if these requirements can be accomplished
         prior to the deployment.
  5.4.9. If the unit has to shortfall any positions, submit shortfall IAW AFI 10-401, Chapter
  10.
     5.4.9.1. Even though units assess a UTC as “Green” in ART, line remarks may require
     capability beyond the unit’s capacity to fill either due to non-availability of assets with
     specific line remarks or due to other competing requirements.
     5.4.9.2. Prior to submitting a reclama, the tasked commander may be required to submit
     a waiver request IAW specific instructions in AFI's 10-401 and 36-3802.
     5.4.9.3. DELETED
     5.4.9.4. The tasked commander must keep the MAJCOM FAMs informed of all waiver
     requests, to include the final decision of the deployed commander. Listing of all personnel
     readiness POCs can be obtained at https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.mil/persco.aspx.
  5.4.10. The UDM will post the selected deploying individual(s) info (name and SSN) into
  LOGMOD or the official tasking memorandum and provide to the IDRC/DCC for tasking
  fill.
     5.4.10.1. UDMs must provide names to fill taskings, or shortfall the tasking(s) to the
     IDRC/DCC IAW timelines prescribed in AFI 10-401, Chapter 10.
     5.4.10.2. IDRC/IPR representatives will update DCAPES within timelines prescribed in
     AFI 36-3802 to show name fill and projected departure data.
     5.4.10.3. These updates support transparency in providing all echelons advance
     notification of projected arrivals and the expected delivery date.
  5.4.11. The unit commander/UDM will ensure in-person (i.e. face-to-face or phone)
  notification of tasking to Airmen within (4) duty days of tasking receipt by
  UDM/Commander. The notification may be done by the commander, UDM, or a supervisor.
  This timing will probably be compressed during crisis action or short notice taskings.
     5.4.11.1. Within (5) duty days of notification of tasking (rotational operations), the
     member will:
     5.4.11.2. Report to the UDM with their CAC for a comprehensive review of the entire
     AFDF. NOTE: This timing will probably be compressed during crisis action or short
     notice taskings.
     5.4.11.3. The UDM will notify the member of any scheduled training/appointments
     required for the tasking, review all applicable reporting instructions (CST, CAST, ECAC,
     APOE, AOR and Location specific) with the member, ensure FCG requirements are met
     or initiated and identify any adverse medical conditions that will prevent the member
     from deploying.
     5.4.11.4. Not earlier than (NET) 30-days prior to PDF processing, or as directed by the
     Commander, the UDM will:
154                                          AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


         5.4.11.4.1. Initiate a final review of readiness status with the member prior to
         scheduling the member’s final out-processing appointment with the IPR.
         5.4.11.4.2. At the final out-processing appointment, the UDM will again review all
         applicable reporting instructions (CST, CAST, ECAC, APOE, AOR and location
         specific), FCG and medical readiness requirements (such as additional vaccinations)
         with the member.
         5.4.11.4.3. UDMs will brief deploying Airmen on the requirement to deploy with all
         mandatory items as outlined in the applicable Reporting/Routing Instructions and that
         failure to do so is a violation of Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice
         (UCMJ).
         5.4.11.4.4. Upon completion of the briefing, the UDM(s) and deploying individual(s)
         will complete, sign and date an AF Form 4005.
         5.4.11.4.5. A Prohibitive Items briefing will be conducted and documented in a
         signed and dated memorandum.
  5.4.12. If known, the UDM will inform the Airman of reporting times as reflected in the
  LOGMOD Schedule or TPFDD. NOTE: UDMs will schedule individuals for individual
  equipment and weapons requirements pickup through the LRS IPE or provide times they
  may do so on their own.
  5.4.13. The UDM will ensure deploying unit member(s) initiate the pre-deployment medical
  clearance process with PH/FHM 120-days prior to deployment date or date of first movement
  to complete pre-deployment medical clearance requirements.
  5.4.14. The Airman will complete all deployment and unit requirements per the guidelines
  given by the UDM, except those scheduled to be accomplished at the PDF, if a processing
  line is scheduled.
  5.4.15. Ten duty days prior to processing at the PDF for steady-state operations, the
  squadron commander will ensure all required actions are complete, with the exception of
  those being accomplished at the PDF. For crisis response, actions will be accomplished as
  soon as possible to meet departure timing.
  5.4.16. AFSC Substitution.
      5.4.16.1. The UTC MISCAP statement outlines the capability of the tasked UTC and
      identifies authorized AFSC substitutions unit commanders will use. The UTC MISCAP,
      functional AFIs, USAF WMP-1 Functional Annexes, or the Supported Command
      processing guidance/line remarks/reporting instructions regulate and control authorized
      substitutions.
      5.4.16.2. AFI 10-401 outlines “Any AFSC” substitutions.
      5.4.16.3. When substituting AFSCs that fall outside the scope of the above guidance,
      unit commanders must coordinate the substitution with the deployed commander. This
      will ensure the substitution continues to satisfy the original tasking requirement without
      mission degradation and the designated person can meet the functional requirements of
      the originally tasked AFSC.
      5.4.16.4. For additional AFSC substitution guidance, see AFI 10-401, Chapter 7.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                       155


  5.4.17. Grade/Skill Level Substitution. Like AFSC substitutions, the UTC MISCAP,
  functional AFIs, USAF WMP-1 Functional Annexes, or the Supported Command processing
  guidance/reporting instructions regulate and control authorized grade and skill level
  substitutions. Unless prohibited by these directives, the following grade and skill level
  apply:
     5.4.17.1. When units identify people to fill deployment requirements, enlisted are tasked
     based upon their Control AFSC (CAFSC) and officers are tasked based upon their Duty
     AFSC (DAFSC).
     5.4.17.2. When selecting personnel, the unit maximizes the matching of the required
     AFSC and grade to the person’s DAFSC (for officers) or CAFSC (for enlisted) and grade
     as much as possible. Line remarks further define and/or refine acceptable fills for the
     requirement. NOTE: Deviations could be directed by a tasking’s line remarks.
     5.4.17.3. Enlisted Skill Level Substitutions.
         5.4.17.3.1. Unless prohibited by line remarks or UTC MISCAP, Airmen with two
         skill levels higher or one skill level lower can satisfy enlisted requirements.
         5.4.17.3.2. EXCEPTION: Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) requirements must be
         filled by a CEM/E-9.
         5.4.17.3.3. EXAMPLES: An Airman having a 3-, 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level can satisfy 5-
         skill level or an Airman having a 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level can satisfy 7-skill level
         tasking requirements.
     5.4.17.4. Enlisted Grade Substitutions.
         5.4.17.4.1. Unless prohibited by line remarks or UTC MISCAP, if the UTC or
         tasking identifies a required grade, the Airman must have that grade or higher grade
         to fill the requirement.
         5.4.17.4.2. EXAMPLE: An Airman with or in a higher grade than E-7 can satisfy an
         E-7 tasking requirement.
         5.4.17.4.3. A CEM/E-9 will only be used to fill a CEM grade requirement.
     5.4.17.5. Officer Grade Substitutions.
         5.4.17.5.1. Unless prohibited by the supported component headquarters through line
         remarks or UTC MISCAP, officer grade requirements will be filled by an officer
         having one grade higher or lower than the required grade.
         5.4.17.5.2. Second and first lieutenants are considered a single grade and can
         substitute in a captain grade requirement, provided they meet the intent of paragraph
         5.4.5.2.
         5.4.17.5.3. EXCEPTIONS:
            5.4.17.5.3.1. Unless prohibited by the supported component headquarters through
            line remarks or UTC MISCAP, a tasked medical commander can be filled by a
            substitute two grades up and two grades down for officers.
            5.4.17.5.3.2. Clinical personnel who are colonels can be tasked to fill non-colonel
 156                                         AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


              requirements. However, for all other AF specialties, a colonel must fill a colonel
              grade requirement unless waived by the supported command.
              5.4.17.5.3.3. EXAMPLES: A captain, major, or lieutenant colonel can satisfy a
              major grade tasking. A lieutenant (1st or 2nd), captain, or major can satisfy a
              captain tasking.
   5.4.18. Volunteer Guidance.
       5.4.18.1. AEF Online (https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.mil/default.aspx) and the DOD
       Civilian Expeditionary Workforce (http://www.cpms.osd.mil/expeditionary) describe
       how active AF personnel (military and civilian) can volunteer for AEF ECS contingency
       taskings.
       5.4.18.2. All volunteers must coordinate their intent to volunteer with their unit
       commander or equivalent to ensure their volunteer status will not adversely impact the
       owning unit’s ability to meet its assigned/committed and AF mission requirements IAW
       AFI 10-401, Chapter 9.
5.5. Personnel Processing.
   5.5.1. Travel Arrangements.
       5.5.1.1. The IDO will review the TPFDD for mode/source of transportation for
       deploying Airmen/units.
       5.5.1.2. If the mode/source (i.e. “AC”) directs AMC contract airlift from AMC
       Gateways, the IDO in conjunction with the IPR will forward the assigned names with
       ULNs and requested dates of travel to the LRS Traffic Management for movement.
       5.5.1.3. The Distribution representative will book the port calls based on the ALD
       provided by the IDO or Plans and Integration Section.
       5.5.1.4. ULNs with mode/source for strategic lift (i.e. “AK”) either out of home station
       or at an aggregate APOE are not given port calls, but will be manifested during passenger
       processing activities.
       5.5.1.5. For large groups, the IDO should consider the GOPAX and/or CCPAX method
       to move individuals. For large groups within driving distances, the IDRC/DCC should
       consider busing to the APOE either by commercial bus or military bus.
       5.5.1.6. If none of these options seem feasible, the IDO will direct LRS Traffic
       Management to arrange commercial airline travel to the APOE only. There are no
       bookings in GATES for sending passengers to the aggregation point.
       5.5.1.7. All movement is projected in the TPFDD. If it becomes necessary that a
       deploying member is not able to deploy on the projected airlift, according to the TPFDD,
       it is imperative that the IDO notifies the respective MAJCOM AEF Cell as soon as
       possible in order to coordinate changes to the TPFDD so that appropriate transportation
       changes can be made.
       5.5.1.8. IAW CJSCM 3122.02D, Appendix F to Enclosure C, LAD = RDD minus port
       handling time (at POD) and transit time (from POD to RDD). This applies to all ULNs.
       The difference between LAD and RDD is the time allotted for JRSOI, in-theater training,
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                        157


     Replacement In-place Transfer of Authority (RIPTOA), and Intra-Theater travel from
     POD to destination.
     5.5.1.9. RDDs may cause deploying Airmen to miss in-theater training/processing.
     5.5.1.10. Some ULNs in support of JET/IA requirements require personnel to be in
     theater earlier than the RDD for JRSOI/RIPTOA.
     5.5.1.11. Port calls must be based on meeting LAD at the POD.
         5.5.1.11.1. Port call planning for these JET/IA requirements will be based off LADs
         in order to be able to meet the CCDRs required JRSOI/RIPTOA.
         5.5.1.11.2. The IPRC/DCC will identify all en route reporting requirements to the
         LRS Traffic Management representative who will book appropriate port calls.
  5.5.2. Unit Personnel Assembly.
     5.5.2.1. Personnel will be processed in mass or individually. Every effort will be made
     to mass process personnel in order to provide a final requirements review that ensures
     members are fully prepared. Even if personnel are processed individually, some level of
     mass processing should be incorporated, if possible. That may include eligibility check;
     pre-deployment briefings (e.g. medical, cultural, anti-terrorism, trafficking in persons,
     anti-hijacking, etc.); last chance medical/immunizations check; and issuing orders, airline
     tickets (if applicable), mobility bags, and weapons/ammo (if applicable).
     5.5.2.2. If airlift will pick Airmen up at home station, they will always assemble at least
     3-hours prior to aircraft departure for manifesting and anti-hijack processing.
     5.5.2.3. Local installations may institute longer lead times to meet their specific needs
     and spell this out in their IDP.
     5.5.2.4. When mass processing, deploying Airmen will be assembled in a pre-identified
     area at the unit NLT the time indicated on the LOGMOD Schedule for unit processing.
         5.5.2.4.1. If processing individually, the UDM will determine the assembly time.
         Regardless if mass or individually processing, the unit will always pre-assemble
         personnel prior to departure.
         5.5.2.4.2. ARC personnel must report to home station prior to deployment and should
         depart from the nearest airport to home station.
         5.5.2.4.3. During unit assembly all deploying personnel will be checked to ensure the
         following:
            5.5.2.4.3.1. All personnel deploying meet requirements outlined in the tasking
            order and line remarks.
            5.5.2.4.3.2. They are eligible (DAV codes, duty status, valid security clearance,
            AFSC skill level and any additional requirements per deployment position line
            remarks).
            5.5.2.4.3.3. They have all personal items in order.
         5.5.2.4.4. Units will identify potential eligibility problems allowing the IDRC/DCC
         maximum time to find qualified personnel from existing base resources.
158                                           AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


  5.5.3. PDF Personnel Transportation.
      5.5.3.1. Dependent upon the type, size and timing of the deployment, the IDO will direct
      units to contact the DCC Transportation Representative to schedule/request transportation
      to get personnel to the processing area.
      5.5.3.2. Unit personnel will work through their UDMs to schedule movement to the PDF
      and/or local airport. Early contact will further help ensure individuals are delivered to the
      processing area in sufficient time to meet LOGMOD Schedule processing times.
      5.5.3.3. Responsibilities will be documented in the IDP. NOTE: In those instances
      where deploying Airmen are utilizing commercial transportation through a local airport,
      the unit should deliver Airmen to the airport to ensure they have everything mentioned in
      paragraph 5.5.2. NOTE: Ensure terminal transportation is in IAW AFI 24-301, paragraph
      3.1.1.
  5.5.4. PDF Processing (Unit Move). The key responsibilities of the PDF are:
      5.5.4.1. Advising commanders when personnel are ineligible for deployment.
      5.5.4.2. DELETED
      5.5.4.3. Providing last-minute services (e.g. legal, chaplain, medical, personnel actions,
      etc.) to Airmen (as requested or required).
      5.5.4.4. Responsibility for full control and accountability from the time unit personnel
      arrive at the PDF until personnel are physically loaded on the aircraft (or other
      embarkation movement source).
      5.5.4.5. Establishing a controlled area to hold all deploying personnel.
      5.5.4.6. Ensuring personnel representatives conduct a roll call to see if all of the correct
      individuals are present for processing.
      5.5.4.7. Performing the final eligibility check.
  5.5.5. Pre-Deployment Briefing Waiver.
      5.5.5.1. Enabler forces deploying multiple times within a 12-month period (60/90/120
      day rotations) to the same locations may waiver certain pre-deployment briefings for a
      period of 12 months.
      5.5.5.2. The waiverable briefings are as follows: A&FRC, Legal, Chaplain and Finance.
      PH/FHM briefings are waiverable only when it is determined that the FOL medical
      situation is un-changed.
      5.5.5.3. Local procedures will be established and codified in IDPs to verify how units
      document briefing dates, track currency and how members that have been granted a
      waiver have not exceeded the one-year expiration.
  5.5.6. CED Orders.
      5.5.6.1. AFI 36-3802 directs all AF unit personnel deploying on contingencies, exercises,
      or deployments to receive CED orders.
      5.5.6.2. CED orders are the only type of TDY orders used to deploy AF personnel
      assigned to AF units when use of JOPES is directed.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                        159


     5.5.6.3. DCAPES is used to produce CED orders.
     5.5.6.4. An individual from the IPR will be assigned to the orders section during
     deployment processing.
     5.5.6.5. AFI 36-3802 provides specific guidance on producing CED orders.
         5.5.6.5.1. CED orders will be produced according to the timelines specified in the
         LOGMOD Schedule and in sufficient time to be included in the Troop Leader
         package for each chalk or at least (1) duty day prior to personnel departing from
         commercial airports.
         5.5.6.5.2. Ensure the tasked ULN (to include any frag and insert) and ULN position
         are included on the orders.
         5.5.6.5.3. Unclassified orders will be used unless driven by specific plan, message, or
         directive. Changes, amendments, or new orders, as required, are published and issued
         before, during, and after the deployment.
         5.5.6.5.4. No CED orders will be issued until the IDO or designated representative
         ensures the unit(s)/person(s) is/are deploying by mode and source IAW the
         OPLAN/CONPLAN TPFDD or equivalent supporting and supported command
         guidance.
     5.5.6.6. Distribution of orders will be IAW AFI 36-3802 and local procedures.
     5.5.6.7. DELETED

         5.5.6.7.2. DELETED
         5.5.6.7.3. DELETED
     5.5.6.8. If the orders cannot be completed, a manual passenger manifest will be
     completed prior to the departure of the aircraft.
         5.5.6.8.1. Ample notification of any late orders will be given to the manifesting
         agency.
         5.5.6.8.2. Manual manifests will be followed up with electronic manifests to
         maintain ITV.
     5.5.6.9. DCAPES is essential to inform deployed commanders, MAJCOM, and the Air
     Staff of the deploying force composition. Appropriate accountability actions in DCAPES
     will be accomplished by the IPR for systemized personnel strength accountability.

      5.5.7.1. The IDO will determine how personnel processing will be accomplished.
      Personnel processing may be accomplished using a full/partial processing line or by
      checklist only.
      5.5.7.2. Personnel processing procedures via checklist will be outlined in the
      installation/wing IDP.
      5.5.7.3. The IPR will develop both inprocessing and outprocessing checklists for
      deploying personnel IAW AFI 36-3802, Chapter 4.
         5.5.7.3.1. Once complete, unit/CCs or their designated representative will verify
         mandatory checklist items are completed and direct their deploying members back to
         their appointed UDM(s) for unit assembly prior to the IDRC for final out-processing.
         5.5.7.3.2. Provided tasking is received, ARC personnel should complete all out-
         processing actions during the unit training assembly prior to their scheduled
         departure.
         5.5.7.3.3. DELETED
         5.5.7.3.4. DELETED
      5.5.7.4. Unit/CC’s have a responsibility to send qualified and eligible personnel to
      process for deployment taskings. A unit/CC’s final acknowledgement on the deployment
      checklist for their deploying member(s) is vitally important as a deployed commander
      does not want anyone unqualified or incapable of performing in a deployed capacity that
      may jeopardize mission integrity.
         5.5.7.4.1. Deploying Airmen will ensure they receive CED orders from their IPR
         prior to deploying from home station. NOTE: Distribution of orders will be IAW
         AFI 36-3802, paragraph 7.4.18, the IPR is responsible for out-processing the
         individual; individuals will not deploy from home station prior to receiving CED
         orders and IDO confirmation of transportation allocation.
         5.5.7.4.2. After Airmen have completed all checklist items required for deployment,
         they will be scheduled by the UDM to meet at a pre-identified area at the unit for unit
         processing. The UDM will determine the assembly time.
         5.5.7.4.3. During unit assembly all deploying personnel will be checked to ensure the
         following are in compliance:
             5.5.7.4.3.1. Personnel meet deployment requirements outlined in the tasking
             order.
             5.5.7.4.3.2. DAV codes, valid security clearance, AFSC skill level and any
             additional requirement(s) per deployment position line remarks(s).
             5.5.7.4.3.3. Personal items are in order.
             5.5.7.4.3.4. Completion of all required training and deployment preparation
             requirements.
      5.5.7.5. Personnel Movement.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                         161


         5.5.7.5.1. When utilizing commercial transportation through the local airport, the unit
         will deliver or arrange transportation for their Airmen to meet scheduled lift. In
         either circumstance, and if practical, deploying Airmen should be met by UDM or a
         designated unit representative after the Airman leaves his/her residence and prior to
         arriving at the airport.
         5.5.7.5.2. AFRC units will meet this requirement when practical. Ensure the Airman
         has a contact number to reach the unit in case of emergency and/or a deviation from
         the planned deployment (e.g. personnel, equipment, or bags do not get on arranged
         transportation).
         5.5.7.5.3. If the Airman is scheduled to meet a commercial rotator chartered by AMC
         at an APOE different from their home station, the unit will work with the IDRC and
         Distribution Management Section to ensure appropriate transportation is
         scheduled/provided for the Airman to meet the required show-time of the mission.
         5.5.7.5.4. Ensure terminal transportation is in IAW AFI 24-301, paragraph 3.1.1.
     5.5.7.6. Once Airmen have departed their home installation, UDMs will ensure that the
     local IDRC has updated status on the departure of the Airmen. They will contact the
     IDRC to inform them of departure time and means of departure.
     5.5.7.7. IDRC/IPR representatives will monitor/update DCAPES to show departure and
     arrival status of deployed members. The IPR will provide departure and arrival
     information to the supporting Civilian Personnel Section (CPS) for update to DCPDS.
     This is essential to establish/maintain personnel strength accounting. If DCAPES does
     not reflect arrival of personnel within (7) duty days of departure, IPRs will contact
     servicing PERSCO Teams to request status of deployed personnel.
  5.5.8. Passenger Manifesting.
     5.5.8.1. Passenger manifests will be prepared for each chalk to ensure in-transit visibility
     from point of origin to final destination.
     5.5.8.2. The individuals assigned to this function will be extremely knowledgeable of the
     requirements of DTR 4500.9-R, Parts I and III.
     5.5.8.3. CMOS or GATES (for CONUS AMC strategic aerial ports and overseas AMS
     units) will generate the passenger manifest based on the orders and files received from
     DCAPES for departure on airlift from home station. LRS Traffic Management or
     Passenger Processing personnel will:
         5.5.8.3.1. Manifest and collect emergency contact information directly from
         deploying personnel.
         5.5.8.3.2. Ensure emergency contact information is not sourced from the Service
         Casualty Affairs Officer, Commander’s Support Staff (CSS)/Unit Orderly Room, or a
         similar single POC IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Part III.
         5.5.8.3.3. Facilitate compliance with 49 U.S.C. § 41113, Plans to Address Needs of
         Families of Passengers Involved in Aircraft Accidents, by requiring the collection of
         identifying and emergency contact information called for in 14 CFR, Part 243,
         Passenger Manifest Information.

       5.5.8.4. If CMOS or GATES are not available to produce the passenger manifest, a DD
       Form 2131, Passenger Manifest, is used. Fax or email DD Form 2131 to AMC/ITV cell
       (ORG.AMCA4-70@us.af.mil) for ITV purposes.
       5.5.8.5. Required information will be exported to CMOS or GATES from DCAPES.
       5.5.8.6. CMOS or GATES will feed personnel manifests to IGC to provide ITV.
       5.5.8.7. Manifesting passengers during AEF rotations will require chalking of passengers
       to meet the scheduled aircraft mission versus final destination. Airmen could be
       deploying to multiple destinations, but are required to arrive in theater on the same LAD
       through the same POD.
          5.5.8.7.1. In order to meet the CCDRs RDD and maximize aircraft utilization, TACC
          may schedule or aggregate Airmen from multiple origins on a single mission.
          5.5.8.7.2. The IDO or IDRC must ensure Airmen are chalked and exported via the
          DCAPES export file titled “CMOSxxx.file” that can be imported into CMOS and
          GATES.
          5.5.8.7.3. The DCAPES export file is provided to the APOE 72-hours prior to
          mission departure.
          5.5.8.7.4. Updates will be transmitted via e-mail as required with a summary of
          changes and a new/updated “CMOSxxx.file” attached.
          5.5.8.7.5. IDO/IDRC personnel will review the applicable APOE reporting
          instructions, via the AEF On-line website, to determine if and when an XMAN (Excel
          Manifest) file is required to be submitted to the appropriate APOE to facilitate the
          passenger manifesting process at the APOE.

       requirements and, along with HAF FAMs for JET taskings, identifies all additional items
       deploying personnel must take.
       5.6.1.3. The supported commander, at execution, determines whether personnel need
       mobility bags, weapons, ammunition, insect vector control measures, and chemical
       injectors.
       5.6.1.4. Mobility bag, ammunition, and small arms management for active duty units
       will be IAW AFMAN 23-110, AFI 10-2501 and AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment
       Maintenance Management.
       5.6.1.5. ANG and AFRC units will follow the guidance of their higher headquarters.
   5.6.2. Deploying Personal Baggage (Acceptability/Limitations).
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                        163


     5.6.2.1. For purposes of this instruction, the term “bag” or “baggage” refers to any soft-
     or hard-sided container with carrying handle(s) containing items necessary for
     personal/duty use for the duration of the deployment.
     5.6.2.2. Personal clothing will be deployed as baggage on the same aircraft transporting
     personnel.
        5.6.2.2.1. Personal clothing will be packed in the type of “checked bags” specified in
        the reporting instructions for the corresponding military or commercial Port of
        Embarkation (POE).
        5.6.2.2.2. Personal luggage/baggage, IPE, and PROGEAR must meet the linear and
        weight requirements described in paragraph 5.6.3.2.
        5.6.2.2.3. Any excess baggage must be authorized on orders.
     5.6.2.3. AOR reporting instructions published by the Supported Commander may limit
     the total number of bags authorized, particularly excess baggage, based upon lift
     availability to, and beddown capabilities at, the ultimate deployed location.
     5.6.2.4. Depending upon the mode of transport (e.g. commercial air segments between
     commercial airports or AMC contract airlift from AMC gateways) selected from origin to
     destination, IDOs, LRS Traffic Management, and deploying units must be aware that
     commercial airlines could further restrict weight, size, and type specifications applicable
     to checked baggage.
     5.6.2.5. IDOs must thoroughly review AOR reporting instructions and consult with the
     installation LRS Traffic Management to verify whether such limitations or additional
     instructions (i.e. special baggage tag requirements), may impact deployment plans or
     execution.
     5.6.2.6. CCDRs are authorized to provide pre-deployed weapons, ammunition, and
     mobility bags at centrally managed and distributed locations within their AOR at ETDCs.
     This could eliminate the need for Airmen to deploy with these assets.
     5.6.2.7. DELETED
     5.6.2.8. It is ultimately the unit commander’s responsibility to ensure unit personnel
     deploy with all required personal items, IPE, and Professional GEAR (PROGEAR), and
     to ensure that all other non-individual issue equipment required for the major operation or
     campaign is properly identified in equipment UTCs.
     5.6.2.9. At no time, will equipment items normally shipped as freight, or deployed as
     cargo be allowed to accompany a deploying individual as part of his or her excess
     baggage authorization, unless specifically stated in CED orders.
     5.6.2.10. Unit commanders must pay particular attention to this point to preclude
     baggage being “bumped” en route due to transport mode weight or space limitations.
     5.6.2.11. Aircraft ACL limitations could exist on AMC contract carrier contingency and
     rotator missions; therefore, excess baggage scrutiny at home station is prudent if
     deploying personnel will travel via this means.
164                                          AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


      5.6.2.12. Deploying members must not add any personal or unauthorized items to their
      A, B, C, or D-bags.
      5.6.2.13. In some cases, deploying units require tools or equipment that are too
      large/heavy for movement on commercial passenger aircraft, and not currently listed in a
      UTC’s MISCAP. In each case, the deploying unit is required to arrange shipment of the
      required equipment separate from the deploying unit, and at unit expense. Either a
      complete MISCAP review needs to be accomplished, or procedures for the referenced
      scenario need to be identified to ensure the cargo movement is accomplished as part of
      the supported operation, tracked in an ITV system, and billed to the supported operation’s
      funds.
  5.6.3. Over Weight/Excess Baggage.
      5.6.3.1. Deploying personnel transiting AMC owned or operated terminals are
      authorized one hand carried bag plus a small personal bag e.g. back-pack, laptop, purse,
      etc. and no more than two pieces of personal baggage, mobility/pro-gear bags and
      weapon cannot exceed 400 lbs. Excess baggage must be annotated in the traveler’s
      orders and must specify the weight and/or number of pieces authorized.
      5.6.3.2. Any single bag exceeding the 70 lb. weight limit or 62 linear inches will count as
      two pieces and count as the member’s second authorized piece of personal baggage.
      EXCEPTION: A3, B-4, duffle, and sea bags shall be allowed as one piece up to 80 linear
      inches as long as they do not exceed 100 lbs.
      5.6.3.3. The second bag must still comply with size restrictions and is limited to 70 lbs.
      NOTE: Commercial tickets that contain only CONUS segments might limit checked
      baggage to 50 lbs each before excess baggage charges are assessed.
      5.6.3.4. Baggage exceeding 80 linear inches/100 lbs will not be accepted (Ref: DTR
      4500.9, Part III for additional guidance and future updates. IPE (A, B, C, and D type
      mobility bags)/IPE and PROGEAR are common, acceptable examples of excess baggage.
      5.6.3.5. There is no standard policy between DOD, FAA and TSA for military shipments
      of weapons in checked baggage or as excess baggage.
         5.6.3.5.1. Ammunition and weapons are not permitted in carry-on baggage but,
         depending on the policy of the airline, can be included with checked baggage.
         5.6.3.5.2. Weapons must be unloaded, packed in a locked, hard-sided case and
         declared at check-in. All airline and TSA requirements must be strictly adhered to.
         5.6.3.5.3. All transportation offices should distinguish excess baggage contents as
         weapons when making airline reservations and ensure coordination with the airlines
         and TSA for handling and packaging instructions. It is suggested that advanced
         copies of the weapon declaration forms be completed in advance to streamline check-
         in.
         5.6.3.5.4. Commercial travel offices should provide proper passenger counseling, to
         include familiarization with rules and requirements of the scheduled service airlines
         and TSA.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                          165


Section 5D—Troop Leader

5.7. Troop Leader.
   5.7.1. After processing of personnel is complete, the IDRC/PDF will designate the senior
   ranking individual assigned to a group of two or more personnel that are deploying on the
   same means of transportation to the same deployed location as the troop leader and provide
   this individual with a Troop Leader’s Personnel Accountability Kit (PAK).
   5.7.2. The troop leader must account for and control the deploying force from the time after
   processing through the PDF (or IDRC) until arrival at the final deployed location.
       5.7.2.1. If deployers are traveling via commercial transportation and do not process
       through the PDF, a troop leader will still be appointed to maintain accountability of
       personnel throughout the trip.
       5.7.2.2. In that case, the troop leader will be briefed on responsibilities by the PDF (or
       IDRC) (see also DTR 4500.9-R, Part III, Appendix T).
   5.7.3. The troop leader will confirm transportation allocation and mode/source of
   transportation before departing.
   5.7.4. DELETED
   5.7.5. Troop leaders, of groups traveling commercially, will be provided all identified
   documentation except for documentation related to travel by military airlift.
   5.7.6. The PDF will brief the troop leader to turn this information over to the reception team,
   Logistics Readiness Center (LRC), or the PERSCO team upon arrival at the deployed
   location to track personnel accountability and to support redeployment planning.
5.8. Ineligible Personnel Deployment. Personnel found to be unqualified or who do not meet
the specifications identified in the tasking by the deployed commander will be returned to home
station.

Section 5E—Personnel Record/Data Documentation

5.9. Record Keeping.
   5.9.1. IDRC personnel will keep station file records for all documentation used to deploy
   both personnel and cargo. These records will be kept for the previous year plus the current
   year.
   5.9.2. All station file records will be maintained and disposed of IAW AFMAN 33-363,
   Management of Records.

                                          Chapter 6

                                  RECEPTION PROCESS

Section 6A—General

6.1. General.
   6.1.1. Reception is the first part of the overall joint concept of Reception, Staging, Onward
   Movement, and Integration (RSO&I). The reception process is designed to integrate
   incoming units into a mission/combat capable force as soon as possible with the flexibility to
   stage and move units forward. It involves off-loading, documenting, accounting for, and
   bedding down inbound equipment and personnel.
   6.1.2. Reference AFI 10-404 and MAJCOM guidance for specific planning processes,
   timing, decision support tools, beddown reception processes, and team composition.
   6.1.3. See Joint Publication 3-35, Deployment and Redeployment Operations, Chapter VI.
   6.1.4. This chapter will cover reception operations from AF main operating bases and FOLs
   where the AF has reception responsibility.

Section 6B—AETF Planning Concept

6.2. AETF Force Modules.
   6.2.1. Within the AETF Force Modules, the “Open the Base,” “C2,” and “Establish the
   Base” modules are primarily responsible for the efficient and effective reception of personnel
   and equipment and completing the ITV to provide the supported CCDR verification of force
   closure.
   6.2.2. For the purposes of this guidance, the reception process, if accomplished correctly,
   enables an efficient and effective redeployment process.
   6.2.3. The redeployment process supports both the forward deployment of personnel and the
   return of personnel to home station.
6.3. Employment and Reception Planning.
   6.3.1. The key to reception planning starts with the Supported Command. The Supported
   Command must develop a program to accomplish ESPs for those installations in its AOR that
   are intended to be beddown locations with or without a major AF presence.
   6.3.2. The Supported and Supporting MAJCOMs OPRs for Base Support and Expeditionary
   Site Planning establish criteria defining the degree to which bases will develop their BSPs
   and ESPs IAW AFI 10-404.
6.4. Command & Control (C2).
   6.4.1. If opening a base, the senior ranking officer will assume command of the deployed
   Contingency Response Group (CRG), and be responsible for the initial C2 of incoming
   forces until the arrival of the EMSG/CC IAW AFI 51-604.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                       167


      6.4.1.1. The aim is to properly manage the reception process and provide an orderly
      transition from base opening to the establishment of the end state organization.
      6.4.1.2. When receiving forces at established AF locations, the CRG may still deploy to
      support the initial arrival of resources.
      6.4.1.3. The established C2 function will retain responsibility for command and control
      of incoming and employed forces.
      6.4.1.4. The installation commander has overall responsibility for reception of forces at
      established AF installations.

Section 6C—Reception Roles and Responsibilities

6.5. Commander, Expeditionary Mission Support Group (EMSG/CC).
   6.5.1. The EMSG/CC is responsible for establishing the base and overall reception of forces.
   6.5.2. After establishment of the base, the EMSG/CC will control the LRC, contingency
   response center, Installation Control Center, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (Prime
   BEEF), and Force Support units.
   6.5.3. These duties require oversight and control over fuels, supply, transportation,
   communications, civil engineer, personnel, services, security/base defense functions, and
   others.
   6.5.4. The EMSG/CC directs the actions of the Reception Control Center (RCC). The
   installation commander directly controls the employment mission and the Expeditionary
   Operations Center (EOC).
6.6. Log C2 Team.
   6.6.1. The Log C2 team’s role is to provide overall control and coordination of reception,
   beddown, staging, onward movement, and redeployment.
   6.6.2. The LOG C2 team:
      6.6.2.1. Manages WRM and coordinates inter-Service, international, and wartime HNS.
      6.6.2.2. Is the focal point for redeployment actions.
      6.6.2.3. The Log C2 Team reports to the EMSG/CC (may be through the LRC or other
      established center).
      6.6.2.4. The Log C2 Team is made up of Logistics Planners and LROs and any
      associated required equipment per applicable UTCs.
   6.6.3. For reception of forces at established AF installations, the DCC, PDF and CDF can
   operate in a dual role as the RCC, Reception Processing Unit (RPU), and Cargo Reception
   Function (CRF) respectively, as bases often deploy and receive forces simultaneously.
 168                                          AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


Section 6D—Reception Workcenters

6.7. Reception Control Center (RCC).
   6.7.1. Provides overall direction and coordination of reception and beddown procedures and
   resolves any problems affecting reception of resources.
   6.7.2. Oversees two functions, the RPU and the CRF. (NOTE: For reception of forces at
   established AF installations, the DCC, PDF and CDF operate in a dual role as the RCC, RPU
   and CRF respectively, as bases often deploy and receive forces simultaneously.)
   6.7.3. Installation/Wing Commanders, or equivalents, will appoint an Installation Reception
   Officer (IRO) in writing IAW AFI 38-101.
   6.7.4. The RCC, if not at an established AF operating location, is created with the arrival of
   the C2 force module. At established AF locations, the RCC is established IAW AFI 10-404.
   Until their arrival, the CRG is responsible for accountability and onward movement of
   arriving forces.
       6.7.4.1. The CRG PERSCO Representative will assume accountability from any in-place
       AFSOC PERSCO Representative or will establish initial accountability for all AF
       personnel and will transfer that accountability to the C2 PERSCO Team upon its arrival.
       6.7.4.2. When a CRG or aerial port is operating at the employment site, the RCC
       representative contacts the appropriate agent to ensure all incoming resources are
       accounted for and customs cleared before moving them to the reception area (Refer to
       AFI 10-404 for more details).
       6.7.4.3. The RCC will report to the LRC or like function, but will not be subsumed by
       that function.
       6.7.4.4. The variety of tasks required to secure the base, build and maintain living and
       operating facilities, provide aircraft fire and rescue support, respond to emergencies, care
       for and feed the population, refuel and resupply aircraft, and beddown transient forces
       would not allow for the focus and concentration required to ensure forces are identified,
       met, accounted for, and integrated.
       6.7.4.5. RCC will monitor the inbound force airlift and the actual arrival times of
       personnel and cargo. See AFI 10-404, Attachment 7, for more on reception processes.
       6.7.4.6. RCC will ensure all personnel are put in contact with their unit of assignment or
       duty sections. At a minimum, the RCC will ensure:
          6.7.4.6.1. They can track incoming units and airlift.
          6.7.4.6.2. Aerial port or CRG, if operating at the deployed locations, receives
          incoming equipment data in GATES.
              6.7.4.6.2.1. If it is the final destination, the manifest will show equipment was
              trucked to the CRF.
              6.7.4.6.2.2. If it is not the final destination, the CRF will manifest equipment
              within CMOS to the next or final destination.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                     169


        6.7.4.6.3. Equipment received is placed in a secure holding area until the owning
        units arrive for pickup.
        6.7.4.6.4. Deployed equipment custodians are required to account for their unit
        equipment through the designated LRS function IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2,
        Part 2, Chapter 22.
        6.7.4.6.5. Arriving personnel are accounted for by PERSCO personnel and briefed
        regarding their mission, work area, local conditions, and command structure.
        6.7.4.6.6. Arriving personnel are assigned lodging.
        6.7.4.6.7. Assigned personnel are met by their work center (if work center is already
        established).
     6.7.4.7. Deployment discrepancies are noted and loaded in AEF Online DPDRT. NOTE:
     Deployment discrepancies for OSI Detachments fall under the purview of AF/OSI/WFR
     (Joint Base Andrews AFB, MD). Formal responses and corrective actions will not be
     counted against the host installation/wing. NOTE: PERSCO’s responsibility for entering
     discrepancies in DPDRT is IAW AFI 36-3802.
     6.7.4.8. The senior AF LRO (e.g. LRS/CC) at the deployed location and the RCC will
     work together to ensure all problems are resolved at the lowest level.
     6.7.4.9. The Air Mobility Control Center at the deployed location will report the number
     of incoming passengers and cargo information to the RCC and coordinate support airlift
     servicing requirements with appropriate agencies.
     6.7.4.10. If reception and deployment occur at a location simultaneously, the senior LRO
     (e.g. LRS/CC) will ensure the proper coordination with all agencies is performed to
     ensure effective utilization of available resources.
     6.7.4.11. Units at the employment location will provide a representative to brief duty
     schedules, chain of command, supervisors, duty locations, and important phone numbers.
     Employed location units will further provide the following briefings or information:
        6.7.4.11.1. Terrorist FPCON and DOD threat level.
        6.7.4.11.2. Applicable SOFA, MOPP, and FPCON cards.
        6.7.4.11.3. Legal (or command) representative will brief ROEs as published by the
        combatant commander.
        6.7.4.11.4. Public Affairs will provide literature on base facilities, mission of the
        base, and the local area, if available.
        6.7.4.11.5. Safety will provide briefings on flightline driving and other local
        conditions.
        6.7.4.11.6. Medical will provide literature on local area health conditions and
        conduct a medical orientation.
        6.7.4.11.7. Security Forces (in coordination with airfield management) will arrange
        for custom clearances.
 170                                         AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


          6.7.4.11.8. Civil Engineer will provide literature on CBRN passive defense
          conditions and necessary Mission-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) levels.
          6.7.4.11.9. Communications and Information Postal Services will provide literature
          on procedures for receiving and sending mail and hours of operation.
          6.7.4.11.10. Force Support Squadron Sustainment Flight will provide lodging
          assignments and arrange for extended hours of operation or ground support meals for
          incoming forces as appropriate. Priority will be given to unit integrity and the
          homogeneous lodging of commissioned and enlisted personnel. Additionally, they
          will work closely with PERSCO to document lodging assignments.
          6.7.4.11.11. Finance will provide assistance in cash advances and pay inquiries.
          6.7.4.11.12. Sister Service Representative(s).    If incoming personnel include
          personnel from the Army, Navy, or Marines, these Services will be contacted to
          provide a representative to assist in receiving and processing their personnel and
          cargo.
          6.7.4.11.13. Security Forces representatives will monitor weapons arrival and
          storage.
          6.7.4.11.14. Force Support PERSCO representative is responsible for providing
          guidelines for accounting of all forces according to AFI 36-3802, Supported
          Command processing instructions/reporting guidance, and the deployed commander.
          6.7.4.11.15. AFOSI will provide the local threat update.
          6.7.4.11.16. Security Forces Commander or Defense Force Commander, if not the
          AEF/SF, will ensure the integrated defense posture and any unique procedures or
          awareness information is provided.
          6.7.4.11.17. Chaplain Corps will provide literature or a briefing on privileged
          communication and religious rites and services available to them at the deployed
          location.
       6.7.4.12. When a CRG or element of a CRG is operating at the employment site, the
       RCC contacts the passenger service agent to ensure all passengers are accounted for and
       customs cleared before moving them to the reception area.
6.8. Reception Processing Unit (RPU).
   6.8.1. The RPU is similar to the PDF, but in a reception role. It provides overall control for
   arriving personnel forces and coordinates requirements for processing and onward
   movement.
   6.8.2. In most cases, the RPU should remain separate from the PDF due to sterilization and
   customs issues.
   6.8.3. The RPU accounts for all arriving and departing personnel. All arriving personnel
   will inprocess with this unit.
   6.8.4. The RPU manages the transportation needs of arriving personnel and delivers baggage
   to and from designated locations. The RPU will be augmented by transportation and unit
   personnel to ensure passengers and baggage are delivered to designated locations.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                          171


   6.8.5. The RPU provides shuttle bus maps/routes and arrival and departure times.
6.9. PERSCO Team.
   6.9.1. The PERSCO Team is a part of the RPU and will account for all arriving and
   departing personnel.
   6.9.2. See AFI 36-3802 for a complete description of PERSCO responsibilities. PERSCO
   personnel and their established procedures will be used for documenting arriving personnel.
   6.9.3. If a PERSCO team is not available, a person will be appointed by the troop leader to
   maintain accountability until a PERSCO team arrives (reference AFI 36-3802).
6.10. Cargo Reception Function (CRF).
   6.10.1. The CRF is similar to the CDF, but in a reception role. It provides overall control for
   arriving cargo/equipment and coordinates requirements for processing and onward
   movement.
   6.10.2. In most cases, there is not enough marshaling capacity for a separate CRF and CDF,
   but the collocated operations must physically keep incoming and outgoing cargo separate.
   6.10.3. Provides for movement of cargo from holding areas based on prioritization given by
   the unit representative or troop leader.
   6.10.4. Collects all documentation and dates (e.g. placards, load/packing lists, LOGMOD
   files, etc.) for incoming cargo. Notifies RCC team of inbound surface deliveries, passenger
   movement status, and cargo hold and movement status.
   6.10.5. Establishes a holding area for collecting pallets, nets, dunnage, and RFID tags to be
   put back into the transportation system. NOTE: For employment sites with CRG support, the
   provisional wing/group provides the CRF process.
   6.10.6. Processes cargo for onward movement and provides continued in-transit visibility.
6.11. Reception Team Information Management.
   6.11.1. In-place teams, to include home station personnel, ―Open the Base‖ forces (e.g.
   CRGs), or “C2” and “Establish the Base” forces, can accomplish the reception of resources.
   6.11.2. Reception teams will capture all data and documentation necessary to account for
   arriving resources using the IDS.
   6.11.2.1. Cargo received will be receipted for in GATES or CMOS, cleared through
   customs, and placed in the appropriate holding area pending distribution to the owners or
   onward movement.
   6.11.3. All personnel arriving at the deployed location will centrally process through the
   RPU, ensuring that full accountability is accomplished via standard AF accountability
   systems used by PERSCO Teams.
   6.11.4. The primary tool suite that supports and enables the reception process is the IDS.
   IDS components at a deployed site might not fully duplicate the tool suite used at home
   station. Minimum tools required are LOGMOD, ICODES, GATES and/or CMOS. The full
   suite of tools (LOGMOD, ICODES, and CMOS/GATES) will be the primary systems
   utilized, if available.
 172                                        AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


   6.11.5. In addition, deployed LRS personnel/LROs will use systems required by AFMAN
   23-110 to account for arriving equipment, spares, and, if centrally stored, munitions,
   weapons, IPE and mobility bags. The web-enabled Combat Ammunition System (CAS) will
   be used to account for and manage all munitions and ammunition under all situations and
   conditions IAW AFI 21-201.
   6.11.6. Finally, for visibility of incoming forces, the RCC requires access to the TPFDD and
   airlift schedules. They will require SIPRNET connectivity for access to DCAPES/JOPES,
   BaS&E, and LOGFAC. If these systems are not available, RCC personnel should be able to
   access classified web sites or e-mail as a backup. For incoming airlift schedules, use IGC,
   GDSS, SMS, or similar airlift tracking system.
6.12. Advance Echelon (ADVON) Team Responsibilities.
   6.12.1. The primary responsibilities of the ADVON team are preparation, execution of unit
   employment, and developing employment reception.
   6.12.2. At established locations, these duties are performed by assigned functions within
   LRS, FSS, Operations planning, Airfield Management, Comptroller, CES, SFS, JAG,
   Medical Group, etc.
   6.12.3. Air Component personnel, in-theater CRGs, or units that may be scheduled to deploy
   to austere bases, limited bases, or collocated bases, may perform these duties. These
   activities are performed by Open the Base forces (e.g. CRG), “C2,” and “Establish the Base”
   force modules at newly opened bases.
   6.12.4. An ADVON team is not required for every deployed unit or location. When used,
   the ADVON team or host unit will assist all other units in the beddown process.
   6.12.5. Deployed Commanders ensure           arriving/deployed   personnel   meet   tasking
   requirements to include line remarks.

Section 6E—Reception Record/Data Documentation

6.13. Reception Record Keeping/Data Documentation . The CRG or RCC will collect the
following documentation and data for all incoming resources:
   6.13.1. Incoming Aircraft Commanders package.
   6.13.2. IDS personnel and levy data disk produced from DCAPES.
   6.13.3. Orders with SSNs.
   6.13.4. ICODES data file.
   6.13.5. Passenger manifests.
   6.13.6. Shippers Declarations.
   6.13.7. Cargo Load and Packing lists.
   6.13.8. AF Form 245, Employment Locator and Processing Checklist.
   6.13.9. DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record.

                                           Chapter 7

                             REDEPLOYMENT OPERATIONS

Section 7A—General

7.1. General.
   7.1.1. Redeployment is defined as the transfer of forces and materiel to support another joint
   force commander's operational requirements, or to return personnel, equipment, and materiel
   to the home and/or demobilization stations for reintegration and/or out-processing.
       7.1.1.1. Redeployment is NOT “deployment in reverse.”
       7.1.1.2. The redeployment TPFDD could reflect fragmented UTCs or ULNs to be
       incrementally redeployed or forward deployed to retain residual capability at original
       deployed locations requiring the supportability of the remaining forces.
       7.1.1.3. Planners (LRS representatives, etc.) need to plan for movement of parts of units,
       UTCs, or ULNs.
       7.1.1.4. Additionally, redeployment can be far more rapid than the deployment phase,
       which makes redeployment planning all the more critical.
   7.1.2. Early planning is essential to an effective and efficient return of deployed resources or
   forward deployment of combat capability.
       7.1.2.1. Redeployment activities need to begin long before receipt of a redeployment
       order.
       7.1.2.2. Normally, the planning process begins upon arrival at the deployed location, and
       if possible, prior to departing home station. This ensures accountability of all deployed
       resources and that redeployment movement activities comply with CCDR and host
       nation’s customs requirements.
       7.1.2.3. If the overall operation becomes a prolonged engagement, a Rotation of Airmen
       (ROA) plan will require consideration. For ROA execution, redeployment planning will
       begin once the rotation plan has been completed to ensure timely replacement of
       resources, overlap, and training en-route requirements.

Section 7B—Redeployment Process

7.2. Redeployment Process.
   7.2.1. Redeployment Planning.
       7.2.1.1. At the CCDR level, redeployment planning will normally begin when the Joint
       Task Force (JTF) staff gathers to plan an operation.
       7.2.1.2. At the installation level, the IDO and logistics planners assist and advise
       deploying commanders, and their redeployment team members on movement
       responsibilities.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                         175


     7.2.1.3. Redeployment team members will assist the employment location’s logistics
     teams and/or Redeployment Assistance Team (RAT) in executing the movement plan at
     the employment site. A RAT team will consist of logistics planners, air transportation,
     traffic management, PERSCO and unit representatives.
         7.2.1.3.1. A critical link for success is for the employment location’s reception team
         to collect and store all aircraft commander’s packages from arriving airlift missions
         during force closure.
         7.2.1.3.2. The reception team will retain documentation for redeployment. At
         employment locations, the lead unit is responsible for redeployment actions for all
         units at the site.
  7.2.2. Redeployment Documentation, Data, and Automated Systems.
     7.2.2.1. The employment location reception and/or logistics readiness team (when/where
     available) will take charge of, consolidate and store all airlift aircraft commander’s
     packages. Otherwise, the deployed logistics planners, or a designated alternates will need
     to obtain the documents.
     7.2.2.2. Deployed units will coordinate, review and update personnel and cargo
     deployment paperwork when required.
     7.2.2.3. Documentation includes: aircraft load plans, personnel and cargo manifests,
     HAZDECs, load and packing lists, etc.
     7.2.2.4. It is imperative both the location’s redeployment team and units keep good
     records of current assigned and redeployed resources.
  7.2.3. Redeployment Electronic Data.
  7.2.3.1. The reception team’s logistics planners are responsible for the collection of resource
  information.
     7.2.3.2. LOGPLAN, CMOS export files, deployed personnel files and tasked plan files
     will be generated at the deployed location or acquired from the unit’s home station.
     7.2.3.3. Pre-planned aircraft load plans and a prioritization plan will be developed and
     re-evaluated throughout the deployment lifecycle.
  7.2.4. Redeployment Support Systems.
     7.2.4.1. IDS is the primary automated suite supporting and enabling the redeployment
     process. All IDS components usage is dependent upon system access and/or CCDR
     processes.
     7.2.4.2. LOGMOD, DCAPES, CMOS (or GATES) and IGC will be used to the
     maximum extent possible to ensure processing efficiency and ITV.
     7.2.4.3. Wherever possible, deploying/deployed logistics planners will utilize LOGMOD
     to develop a Redeployment LOGMOD Schedule for the purpose of preparing, scheduling
     and processing deployed personnel and cargo for redeployment.
 176                                         AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


       7.2.4.4. In instances where LOGMOD is not available for redeployment operations, a
       locally developed system to schedule and prepare pax and cargo for redeployment will be
       required.

Section 7C—Redeployment (Rotational Operations)

7.3. Rotational Operations.
   7.3.1. From an employment location, force rotation is a sustainment activity for personnel
   and equipment using the AEF schedule. It provides a force presence without permanently
   assigned forces or to support normal operations beyond the capability of the theater assigned
   forces.
   7.3.2. Considerations directly impacting rotation operations are similar to deployment
   planning with the following additional concerns: overlap for continuity, commanders release
   of personnel, ARC volunteers on mandays, and en-route training requirements. These factors
   are critical to rotation planning and are the basis for developing rotational airlift plans.

Section 7D—Redeployment Workcenters

7.4. Redeployment Organizations/Work Centers/Roles and Responsibilities.
   7.4.1. Deployed Command Organization.
       7.4.1.1. The command organization at a deployed location varies depending upon theater
       and the designated lead, single Service command or JTF.
       7.4.1.2. The deployed commander usually tasks a J4/A4 as lead agent for execution of
       redeployment activities; however, determination of units and timing is primarily a
       commander and J3/A3 decision.
       7.4.1.3. During AEF rotations, the deployed commander must ensure TPFDD
       verification timelines/suspenses are met, personnel are released to meet the RLD and
       ALD and coordinate extensions that exceed tour length.
       7.4.1.4. Deployed commander must authenticate redeployment orders before taking
       action.
   7.4.2. Redeployment Assistance Team (RAT).
       7.4.2.1. A RAT is a contingent of logistics specialties the employment location does not
       have and/or have insufficient quantities/skill sets, to include equipment, to handle the
       actions required to assist and/or lead the processing/loading of personnel and equipment
       for transport.
       7.4.2.2. Suggested RAT composition, although not all inclusive, includes logistics plans,
       air transportation, traffic management and PERSCO. Transportation equipment may also
       be required.
       7.4.2.3. The lead deployed commander will request RAT support through the supported
       air component. In the case of aircraft units, the RAT is usually from their home station.
   7.4.3. Deployed Unit Redeployment Team.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                          177


     7.4.3.1. Redeployment team should be composed of deployed logistics planners,
     PERSCO, air transportation, traffic management, unit personnel and cargo increment
     monitors.
     7.4.3.2. The lead unit; in coordination with host base IDO, will manage the
     redeployment team at locations with personnel and/or equipment from different home
     stations.
     7.4.3.3. Support equipment required to load personnel and equipment aboard air, land
     and sea transport.
     7.4.3.4. The redeployment team workcenters are: Log C2 Cell, Unit Redeployment
     Workcenter (URW), Cargo Redeployment Function (CRF) and Personnel Redeployment
     Function (PRF).
  7.4.4. Contingency C2 Planning Team/Cell.
     7.4.4.1. Logistics Planners, acting on behalf of deployed commanders, receive
     tasking/redeployment orders verbally or through levy flow, messages, or other official
     notification.
     7.4.4.2. The team will manage the actions to process, load, and rotate personnel and
     equipment.
     7.4.4.3. At a minimum, Logistics Plans representatives, in concert with RAT members,
     will plan for and execute movement of deployed resources.
     7.4.4.4. The cell will also monitor TPFDD and coordinate “AK” or strategic aircraft
     moves with forward A4, direct/schedule members to move on “AK” missions and
     provide electronic manifests for each mission from the APOE.
     7.4.4.5. Air Transportation or Traffic Managers book channel moves in GATES and
     coordinate onward movement for all members from the APOD to home station.
     Responsibilities are:
     7.4.4.6. The Contingency C2 Planning Scheduler, a member of the Contingency C2
     Planning Team/Cell, builds, coordinates with redeploying units, and publishes the
     Schedule based on the redeployment tasking and scheduled transportation.
        7.4.4.6.1. The C2 Planning Cell distributes final Schedule to all unit redeployment
        work centers and accomplishes preliminary load plans based on the redeployment
        airflow message, if applicable.
        7.4.4.6.2. The redeployment LOGMOD Schedule will be in the same or similar
        format as the LOGMOD Schedule.
        7.4.4.6.3. The load plans used to redeploy are usually very similar to the ones needed
        to deploy, but will require revisions due to changes in cargo weight, aircraft type,
        priority shift/changes of personnel or cargo, MHE availability, and/or special
        handling situations.
        7.4.4.6.4. Each load will be planned according to the number of seats available,
        ACL, and the cargo load level of difficulty (or time it takes to load, for your location).
178                                          AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


         Logistics planners will work closely with the transportation load planner to make sure
         all cargo is correctly identified on the load plans.
         7.4.4.6.5. Add time into the LOGMOD Schedule for customs, security measures,
         local geography, meal processing, aircrew rest, and aircraft configuration and
         preparation.
         7.4.4.6.6. Coordinate with the unit representatives, transportation, personnel, food
         service, and customs for a review of the schedule timing criteria. After finalization,
         ensure all affected agencies receive copies of the LOGMOD Schedule and any
         changes.
      7.4.4.7. Equipment and Personnel Preparation.
      7.4.4.8. Recall various kinds of equipment: WRM, mobility equipment, host nation, and
      contracted equipment.
      7.4.4.9. Units prepare equipment for shipment (prioritize, identify owning unit,
      destination, and hazardous materials; create cargo movement markings; and build up
      pallets).
      7.4.4.10. It is the unit’s responsibility to ensure that all redeploying cargo is cleaned
      IAW applicable U.S. (or host nation) Customs and Agricultural requirements.
      7.4.4.11. Recall and assemble personnel, as required, to ensure they are ready to
      redeploy, whether it be forward or back to home station.
      7.4.4.12. Coordinate home base nation’s customs and agriculture inspections.
      7.4.4.13. The redeploying unit is responsible to ensure all equipment documentation is
      correct and their equipment is properly cleaned to meet customs and agriculture
      requirements to eliminate introduction of exotic agricultural pests and animal disease
      agents.
  7.4.5. Redeployment Documentation.
      7.4.5.1. Collect and document redeployment activity data using IDS components, or
      hard-copy means. This data is of historical significance and is used in trend analysis and
      process improvement.
      7.4.5.2. Documents/files to collect are: Logistics Plans files, LOGMOD Schedule,
      PERSCO files, and cargo/passenger manifests.
      7.4.5.3. Accomplish documentation of lessons learned using the AF’s web-based lessons
      learned reporting tool “Joint Lessons Learned Information System (JLLIS).”
  7.4.6. . Redeployment Meals. Arrange to secure and provide in-flight meals to redeploying
  forces. Rations may be the only option available for in-flight feeding.
  7.4.7. Coordinate and assist contracting officers with the closing of a deployed location
  when required. Ensure all negotiated agreements are considered, complied with, and
  terminated, if appropriate.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                      179


7.5. Unit Redeployment Workcenters (URW).
   7.5.1. Deployed units are required by this AFI to deploy cargo increment monitors. The
   units will use these members plus additional unit members to manage the URW.
   7.5.2. The URW will process personnel/equipment and up channel LIMFAC/shortfalls
   relating to personnel, facilities, vehicles, MHE, and any other equipment necessary for the
   redeployment to the Contingency C2 Planning team/cell.
   7.5.3. Unit Redeployment Work Center Responsibilities:
      7.5.3.1. Deployed unit commanders must prepare and handle equipment and cargo IAW
      DTR 4500.9-R, Parts II and III; AFMAN 24-204(I); and Code of Federal Regulations
      Title 49 Transportation.
      7.5.3.2. Prepare documentation for each increment of cargo IAW cargo preparation
      guidance in Chapter 4.
      7.5.3.3. Units must include, at a minimum, the same documentation required for
      deployment. Ensure all customs documentation is complete. IMPORTANT: Original
      deployment documentation cannot be used as redeployment documentation. Cargo
      and/or passengers might not redeploy in the same mode as deployment. Units must
      ensure representatives can prepare assets based on movement type.
      7.5.3.4. Unit identification, destination, and cargo movement markings must be clearly
      visible to assist transportation personnel to efficiently retrograde equipment. Proper
      identification and markings are especially important when moving by sea or when aircraft
      have integrated loads for multiple destinations.
      7.5.3.5. To aid in identifying unit cargo, use distinctive, waterproof markings, or
      placards made of squares of canvas that will be visible from a distance.
      7.5.3.5.1. Handle and ship classified material IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Parts II and III, DoD
      5200.1-R, AFI 31-401, and AFI 24-203. AFI 31-401 also gives specific guidance on how
      to account for deployed classified material.
      7.5.3.6. Provide qualified drivers for specialized equipment and vehicles.
      7.5.3.7. Required shoring/dunnage will be provided by the redeploying unit and must
      remain with its associated equipment. NOTE: Units redeploying from certain locations
      may be required to leave wooden dunnage behind due to pest infestations.
      7.5.3.8. Deployed equipment custodians are required to account for their unit equipment
      through the designated LRS function IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter
      22.
      7.5.3.9. Ensure return of WRM, borrowed, host nation, or leased equipment to owning
      organizations before unit departure.
      7.5.3.10. Be prepared to provide personnel resources to aid and assist in the
      redeployment process when requested by the Contingency C2 Planning Team/Cell.
      7.5.3.11. Units redeploying by convoy must follow cargo preparation requirements in
      AFI 24-203.
180                                           AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


      7.5.3.12. Deployed commanders must ensure hazardous waste is properly handled and
      prepared for retrograde or disposal IAW current guidance and host nation requirements.
      7.5.3.13. Units may be tasked to provide augmentees to support loading operations. For
      specific guidance on how to load aircraft, consult DTR 4500.9-R, Part III, and the
      applicable aircraft –9 TO.
      7.5.3.14. Handle and ship classified material IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Parts II and III, DOD
      5200.1-R, AFI 31-401, and AFI 24-203.
  7.5.4. Cargo Redeployment Function (CRF).
      7.5.4.1. As with the CDF, the local deployed LRS, or equivalent, establishes the
      capability to in-check, marshal, JI, and load equipment for redeployment.
      7.5.4.2. Responsibilities established in paragraph 2.36.3.1 also apply to redeployment
      operations.
      7.5.4.3. Contingency C2 Planning Team/Cell, CRG, or designated cargo function must
      use CMOS or AMC systems (GATES) to maintain cargo ITV. CMOS/GATES will pass
      the movement data to IGC.
      7.5.4.4. When present, a CRG, or their equivalent, validates redeployment load plans and
      passenger/cargo manifests, supervises and controls cargo load teams, provides
      RAMPCOs, performs JIs, and provides/operates MHE beyond the capability of the
      redeploying unit. When present, a CRG works closely with the Contingency C2 Planning
      Team/Cell and RAT to ensure meeting of redeployment closure times.
  7.5.5. Passenger Redeployment Function.
      7.5.5.1. A deployed Passenger Redeployment Function must complete all redeployment
      actions required for personnel movement as developed by the Contingency C2 Planning
      Team/Cell and the deployed commander. The deployed PERSCO can be embedded with
      this function performing necessary out-processing and personnel accountability actions
      IAW AFI 36-3802. Items considered during the planning effort are:
      7.5.5.2. SOFAs and customs of the host country.
      7.5.5.3. Type of personnel structure needed to retain residual capability of the deployed
      site, if required.
      7.5.5.4. Ensuring projected mode of transportation and itinerary are reported in available
      deployed IDS components or message traffic to facilitate ITV. At a minimum,
      redeployment departure dates (projected and/or actual) and mission or flight numbers
      must be updated in DCAPES.
      7.5.5.5. Ensuring redeployment priorities and sequence of all resources is determined
      based on the modes of scheduled transportation (airlift/sealift/ground) in the TPFDD.
      7.5.5.6. The redeploying unit commander will select couriers (cargo/classified) familiar
      with the cargo for each load, as necessary. These couriers will be first on the aircraft; the
      rest of the seats will be filled according to the operational demands.
      7.5.5.7. Ensure the out-processing plan includes checkout with lodging, Security Forces,
      Force Support, deployed First Sergeant, and others as needed. Ensure redeployment
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                        181


     documents clearly reflect all personnel redeploying. It is important to stress the deployed
     unit commander or their designated representatives are the only personnel that can
     authorize personnel departures from a unit.
  7.5.6. Passenger Embarkation (Loading).
     7.5.6.1. Like the home station PDF, the Personnel Redeployment Function plays an
     essential role in the development of processes for passenger check-in, identification of
     “sterile” waiting areas, and the eventual loading of aircraft. Ensure procedures are in
     place to alert appropriate agencies of personnel not departing on scheduled aircraft. This
     affects both future passenger flow and end-strength of a location.
     7.5.6.2. Ensures that a personal amnesty room or box is available for all personnel to
     pass through before customs inspection. Brief all personnel on contraband regulations
     before they pass through the amnesty room or by the amnesty box.
     7.5.6.3. Ensures passenger manifests are prepared for each deploying chalk. IDS use
     will provide the automation needed to support this requirement.

                                          Chapter 8

                           HOME STATION REINTEGRATION

Section 8A—General

8.1. General.
   8.1.1. DELETED
   8.1.2. While overall deployment cycle activity falls to the IDO, FSS/CC is the OPR for
   reintegration. As such, the FSS OPSO will directly coordinate with the RPWG and helping
   agencies identified in this chapter (e.g. Airmen & Family Readiness, Chaplain Corps, Legal,
   Medical, etc.) and/or with the CAIB/IDS forum led by the Installation/Wing Commander or
   designee to maximize support processes and results for returning Airmen.
   8.1.3. DELETED
8.2. Home Station Reintegration.
   8.2.1. Home Station Reintegration to include pre-reintegration, is designed to provide
   positive and sustained care, control, and discipline of each Total Force Airman (civilian and
   military—active duty, Guard, & Reserve) and their families.
   8.2.2. Home station reintegration support is an ongoing process, NOT a homecoming event.
   The intent is to provide continuous, integrated support from the AOR to home station and
   facilitate positive transition from the deployed environment to home station family and work
   life.
   8.2.3. Pre-reintegration events occur during the redeployment cycle; however, completion of
   applicable action items is designed to support, or be completed during, reintegration. For
   example, leave en route [pre-reintegration] and inprocessing at home station [reintegration].
8.3. Recovery.
   8.3.1. After periods of arduous duty and protracted periods of deployment, a lengthy respite
   from the deployment environment has a beneficial effect on an individual’s overall fitness
   i.e. mental, physical, social and spiritual health. An immediate recovery period also provides
   time for returning Airmen to tend to personal needs that have been neglected during lengthy
   periods away from home.
   8.3.2. Each MAJCOM is responsible for establishing and publishing personnel recovery
   (e.g. leave, passes, attribution and retention) policies for returning deployers.
   8.3.3. MAJCOMs must ensure all personnel including AFRC/ANG receive their entitled
   post deployment down time. References: AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, and AFI
   36-815, Absence and Leave, (civilian) for further guidance on leave and passes.
   8.3.4. The Home Station Reintegration also implements DOD and AF guidance, and the
   DOD/Department of Veterans Affairs (DOD/VA) Post Deployment Health Clinical Practice
   Guidelines (PDH-CPG). More information can be found at http://www.pdhealth.mil.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                      183


8.4. Scope.
   8.4.1. Home station reintegration support applies to deployed AORs (OCONUS and
   CONUS), contingency support, remote assignments, and home stations.
   8.4.2. Key determinants for participation are lengthy family separation and significant
   family-related stressors prior to reintegration.
   8.4.3. CAIB/IDS-Delivery help agencies complete specified activities to support Total Force
   Airmen, their family members, and units during the AEF Schedule. Readjustment from duty
   in the AOR requires structured recovery time and activities for members and families, prior
   to leave or TDY.
8.5. Training.
   8.5.1. Critical components for training all personnel involved in the Home Station Support
   Processes include:
      8.5.1.1. Recognizing readjustment difficulties.
      8.5.1.2. Normalization for members following deployments
      8.5.1.3. De-stigmatizing help-seeking behavior.
      8.5.1.4. Connecting members with CAIB/IDS-Delivery agencies for support.
   8.5.2. At home station, the CAIB/IDS-Delivery members provide training and education for
   commanders, their designees, First Sergeants, supervisors, UDMs, Wingmen, and new
   CAIB/IDS-Delivery members.
   8.5.3. CAIB/IDS-Delivery members support the IDO by acting as the commander’s
   consultants and using MAJCOM-specific redeployment support processes and reintegration
   education material posted on Military OneSource, Armed Forces Crossroads,
   MilitaryHOMEFRONT, USAF Services and AEF Online websites.
      8.5.3.1. A&FRC Deployment Support material can also be found on the A&FRC
      website. The CAIB/IDS-Delivery agencies provide integrated, interoperable programs to
      strengthen force readiness.
      8.5.3.2. Reintegration education, medical care, spiritual support, and childcare will be
      available for Total Force personnel and their family members.
   8.5.4. A&FRCs collaborate with other IDS-Delivery agencies to develop reintegration
   training and education material. A&FRCs provide material to the Chaplain Corps and MHC
   personnel in the AOR via e-mail, websites, or hard copy.
   8.5.5. Annual deployment preparedness training is required for all AFRC military personnel
   and will be coordinated by the AFRC Wing Deployment Support Program POC. The dates
   of annual training will be included in the wing or unit training tracking system.
8.6. Funding.
   8.6.1. Post-Deployment funding will be requested and is provided through AF funding
   channels per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, and Volume 2,
   Budget Management for Operations. Funding will be used to purchase training guides for
   leadership and military in an AOR and for leadership, members, and families for successful
 184                                           AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


   reintegration and reunion. Contact the local finance/budget office for base and MAJCOM
   specific guidance.
   8.6.2. Incremental costs caused by a higher than normal deployment rates (e.g. Overseas
   Contingency Operations (OCO)) would allow incremental expenses associated with those
   contingencies to be coded against them. Work with the servicing Finance Managers to make
   the determination if the cost was truly incremental, and if so, code it as such.
   Reimbursement might not be dollar for dollar, so wings, MAJCOMs, and HAF will have to
   determine if this program has a higher priority relative to their other requirements.
   8.6.3. Promotional items for the express intent of awareness, training and education, and
   implementation of post-deployment services to eligible family members will be procured
   IAW AFI 65-601, Volume 1. Promotional items may target age-specific audiences for both
   adults and youth participants and be used by various CAIB/IDS-Delivery agencies as they
   deliver services in the AOR and at the home station.
8.7. Pre-Reintegration/Reintegration Guidance.
   8.7.1. Minimum mandatory guidance is specified for functions and activities to be
   coordinated within AF/MAJCOM/Installation Community Action Information Boards
   (CAIB) to support the scope of operations at the base level (e.g. Force Support, Logistics,
   Chaplain Corps, Finance, Legal, etc.).
   8.7.2. Maximum flexibility is advised for each MAJCOM to develop pre-reintegration and
   reintegration support processes tailored for its unique mission and personnel utilization
   during deployments.
   8.7.3. Command authority and responsibilities are delineated for support to Total Force
   Airmen, families, and units. Consultative and training responsibilities are outlined for the
   helping agencies included as members of the CAIB/IDS-Delivery.
   8.7.4. The Deployment Cycle Timeline (Figure 8.1.) shows the overlap with the
   redeployment process, actions to complete upon return to home station, and provides a
   template for commanders’ responses and actions and CAIB/IDS-Delivery members’
   activities at the critical junctures of redeployment, recovery, reintegration, and reconstitution.
   Subsequent sections provide detailed information.

             8.15.2.5. MTFs are responsible for providing access to care; however, unit commander
             support is vital to the success of the DHA process. The MTF and unit commanders must
             collaborate to ensure Airmen receive timely care and support for unmet healthcare needs.
             Compliance with deployment health requirements of assigned personnel is a
             Commander’s responsibility.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                           191

   programs; and distribute commercial, printed materials addressing deployment. Upon
   request, one-on-one counseling is provided.
       8.16.3.1. A&FRC staffs further provide support to parents and siblings of single Airmen.
       8.16.3.2. AOR supporting A&FRCs can provide reintegration materials via e-mail,
       websites, and/or hard copy.
   8.16.4. Post-deployment assistance is linked to pre-deployment activities, particularly early
   intervention that is designed to educate families, single members, and units on reintegration
   and reunion concerns. A&FRC staffs play an integral role in reintegration monitoring,
   family coping skills, assisting with potential at-risk families and collaborating with the
   CAIB/IDS-Delivery agencies in order to ensure smooth family reunions.
8.17. Comptroller (Wing/FM). FM personnel provide redeploying Airmen with guidance on
financial matters.
8.18. Legal Office. Base legal office redeployment activities will focus on assisting the
individual with personal and legal affairs that have arisen as a result of deployment and regaining
a sense of normalcy.
8.19. Squadron/Unit.

       begin personnel recovery (post deployment downtime and leave) as soon as possible.
       Inprocessing briefings and stations should include Finance, PH/FHM, Legal, and Civilian
       Personnel Section (if applicable).
       8.19.1.3. Coordinate with the UDM and IPE Element for mass turn-in of mobility bags
       and other issued items at inprocessing.
       8.19.1.4. At home station, within 4-duty days of redeployment, reintegration processing
       serves as a time for observing, screening, identifying, and referring returning members,
       families, and units who could benefit from readjustment support during the AEF schedule
       recovery period.
   8.19.2. Unit first sergeants will:
       8.19.2.1. Coordinate with the A&FRC, Chaplain Corps, MHC, and Family Advocacy
       Outreach Managers to plan and schedule reintegration briefings and individual
       counseling opportunities.
       8.19.2.2. Invite families to attend reintegration briefings.
8.20. Home Station Inprocessing Requirements.
   8.20.1. The IDO is responsible for the installation/wing’s redeployment process. In order to
   maximize inprocessing processes for returning Airmen, IDOs will work with the IRO and
   FSS/CC to establish efficient reception and reintegration processing procedures.
   8.20.2. The IPR will develop procedures to account for members returning from
   deployments and update their return in DCAPES IAW AFI 36-3802.
   8.20.3. All military and civilian personnel must process through PH/FHM prior to starting
   post deployment downtime. PH/FHM personnel will validate the member has completed
   DHA #2 and that they have received a post-deployment medical debriefing. These DOD
   mandated requirements are necessary to protect the member and their family from significant
   health threats and contagious diseases the member might have been exposed to at the
   deployment location.
   8.20.4. If PDHA was not completed in theater, the appointment for it will be made
   immediately upon return from deployment, and they will be seen within 30-days of returning.
   8.20.5. Within 5-duty days of return to home station, submission of redeployment travel
   vouchers aids the local finance office in their efforts to stop continued accrual of area of

   other CAIB/IDS-Delivery agencies.
   8.21.2. IAW AFI 36-3009, A&FRC provides follow-up to Return and Reunion activities.
   NOTE: Air Reserve Component units without an MHC, Family Advocacy, or Chaplain
   Corps support will need to request this support through their host active duty unit IAW AFI
   44-153, Traumatic Stress Response.
   8.21.3. If referral(s) are recommended on the PDHA, requested by the patient, or positive
   MHC responses are made on the PDHA, follow-up IAW PDHA guidance, AFI 44-170,
   Preventative Health Assessment, and clinical judgment. NOTE: Additional deployment
   health guidance is available at the following link: https://kx.afms.mil/deploymenthealth
   8.21.4. R-Day (within 30 days). At home station, PDHAs must be filed in the permanent
   medical record within 30 days of return. Serum sample must be deposited within the serum
   repository within 30 days. For any recommended referrals on the PDHA, or any referrals
   requested by the patient, PH/FHM will initiate a t-con to the patient’s PCM for follow-up.
   This checklist applies to all Active Duty and DOD civilian deployers.
   8.21.5. R-Day Follow Up (3-6 months).
       8.21.5.1. At home station, all redeployers (military and civilian) complete an online DD
       Form 2900 IAW ASD (HA) Policy Memorandum, 10 Mar 05.

       cognizant for concerning post-deployment mental health signals from returning
       redeployers.

Section 8F—Reconstitution

8.22. Reconstitution.
   8.22.1. Although a key consideration is to provide support to returning forces to transition
   back to their normal environment, it must also be remembered that forces must be
   reconstituted for further deployment possibilities including surge requirements.
   8.22.2. The reconstitution process entails planning that will return units back to their full
   combat capability in a short time. While there is no one correct rule set for reconstitution
   planning, consideration must be given to prioritizing and restoring levels of consumables
   expended during the crisis, and recovering lost training. Every base/unit will have to assess
   their own situation based on such variables as the magnitude, duration and intensity of a
   crisis, consumption rates, and the type of deployment location (fixed vs. austere base).
   8.22.3. Reference AFI 10-401, Chapter 3, for further guidance on reconstitution.

                  LESSONS LEARNED AND AEF DEBRIEF PROCESS

Section 9A—Lessons Learned

9.1. Lesson Learned.
   9.1.1. A Lesson Learned (L2) is an observation that, when validated and resolved, results in
   an improvement in military operations or activities at the strategic, operational, or tactical
   level and results in long-term, internalized change to an individual or an organization.
   9.1.2. AF/A9L provides specific guidance on the AF L2 Program and lesson observations of
   an urgent nature can be disseminated via a Quick Lesson Report and are sent out
   immediately after the event. NOTE: AF/A9L provides specific guidance on the AF L2
   Program in AFI 90-1601.

Section 9B—Afer Action Reports

9.2. After Action Reports (AAR).
   9.2.1. AARs are the means by which the AF records issues, best practices, and lessons
   learned from major exercises, operations, and experiments.
   9.2.2. AARs are applicable to the CJCS exercise program, other joint exercises, AF
   exercises (above wing level), and real world operations.
   9.2.3. AARs are consolidated reports that include an executive summary covering the event
   information (i.e. dates, locations, participant units/organizations, etc.), issues/problems
   encountered, and lessons observed.
   9.2.4. AAR executive summaries document and provide a description of operations and
   exercises, including dates, locations, objectives, major participants, and limitations. It also
   provides the commander submitting the AAR the opportunity to address any of the issues
   identified in the AAR, or add any command-level issues he/she determines must be identified
   in this forum.
9.3. Submission Process.
   9.3.1. The senior deployed location commander will consolidate AAR inputs from
   subordinate unit commanders, validate observations and submit the report to the NAF (C-
   NAF) NLT end-event +15 days (or as directed).
   9.3.2. AEW/CCs will consolidate AAR inputs from subordinate unit commanders, validate
   observations and submit the consolidated AAR to the C-NAF/A9L office NLT 30-days prior
   to AEF rotation date, or as directed by the C-NAF.
       9.3.2.1. Observations in the AAR will clearly identify the issues/problems encountered
       and successful practices, as well as provide sufficient discussion for follow-on forces to
       understand the context.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                      195


      9.3.2.2. A properly documented observation will be actionable by follow-on forces or
      HHQ staffs. This documentation is essential for planning subsequent exercises and
      operations, tasking corrective actions and sharing with follow-on forces.
      9.3.2.3. AAR observations will describe how the mission could be/was improved,
      potential risks to mission degradation and how to mitigate those risks.
   9.3.3. Joint Lessons Learned Information System (JLLIS) is a web-based system that
   implements the requirements for the Joint Lessons Learned Program (JLLP).
      9.3.3.1. JLLP provides transfer of knowledge within the DOD through the rapid
      distribution of Observations and recommendations, AARs, TTPs topic papers, briefings
      and interviews.
      9.3.3.2. JLLIS allows AF Observations, lessons, AARs, L2 and other information up to
      SECRET.
      9.3.3.3. JLLIS is used to track and disseminate Lessons Identified throughout the AF and
      DOD.
   9.3.4. Individuals may also submit observations at any time during the pre-deployment,
   deployment, and redeployment phases via the DOD L2 reporting tool. These reports will
   encompass training, preparation, deployment and on-call phases on the AEF schedule.
   Individuals or organizations without access to the JLLIS website will use AF Forms 4329
   and 4330 to record their observations and e-mail them directly to the appropriate NAF,
   MAJCOM, or HAF-level L2 office. Both forms are available online at http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil.
9.4. Review Process.
   9.4.1. Tier-1 (MAJCOM) and Tier-2 (NAF, DRU, FOA, Wing, etc.) Lesson Managers and
   SMEs will review all “Pending” lessons within their Tier.
   9.4.2. Once an Observation is deemed valid, the Tier-1 or Tier-2 Lesson Manager will
   activate the Observation as a Lesson Identified and transfer it to the appropriate OPR/OCR
   for review.
   9.4.3. Observations that require work within the Tier will be coordinated through the Tier-
   1/Tier-2 Lesson Manager or the appropriate OPR/OCR.
   9.4.4. Periodic reviews will be produced based on deployed commander (AEW/CC or
   equivalent) submissions, during ongoing operations that involve unit and/or commander
   rotations (e.g. AEF rotations),
      9.4.4.1. Commanders will accomplish these submissions prior to the rotation in order to
      provide oncoming units and commanders timely lessons learned information to help
      prepare them for mission execution.
      9.4.4.2. C-NAF, or equivalents, will determine timelines, but typically submissions will
      be submitted 30-days prior to rotation.

XP—Wing Plans

Terms
Acquisition and Cross Service Agreements (ACSA)— Agreements negotiated on a bilateral
basis with U.S. allies or coalition partners that allow U.S. forces to exchange most common
types of support, including food, fuel, transportation, ammunition, and equipment. Authority to
negotiate these agreements is usually delegated to the combatant commander by the Secretary of
Defense. Authority to execute these agreements lies with the Secretary of Defense, and may or
may not be delegated. Governed by legal guidelines, these agreements are used for
contingencies, peacekeeping operations, unforeseen emergencies, or exercises to correct logistic
deficiencies that cannot be adequately corrected by national means. The support received or
given is reimbursed under the conditions of the acquisition and cross-servicing agreement. (JP 4-
08, Joint Doctrine for Logistic Support of Multinational Operations)
Aerial Port Squadron (APS)— An Air Force organization that operates and provides the
functions assigned to aerial ports, including processing personnel and cargo, rigging for airdrop,
packing parachutes, loading equipment, preparing air cargo and load plans, loading and securing
aircraft, ejecting cargo for in-flight delivery, and supervising units engaged in aircraft loading
and unloading operations. (JP 1-02, DOD Dictionary of Military Terms
Agile Combat Support (ACS)— The ability to create, protect, and sustain air and space forces
across the full range of military operations. It is the foundational and crosscutting United States
Air Force system of support that enables Air Force operational concepts and the capabilities that
distinguish air and space power-speed, flexibility, and global perspective. Agile combat support
is an Air Force Distinctive Capability. (AFDD 4-0, Combat Support)
Air & Space Expeditionary Force (AEF)— The AEF force generation construct manages the
battle rhythm of the force in order to meet global CCDR requirements while maintaining the
highest possible level of overall readiness. (AFPD 10-4, Operations Planning: Air & Space
Expeditionary Force)
Air & Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF)— A deployed numbered air force or
command echelon immediately subordinate to a numbered air force provided as the United
States Air Force component command committed to a joint operation. (JP 3-30, Command and
Control for Joint Air Operations)
Automatic Identification Technology (AIT)— Used in the Defense Transportation System
(DTS) are bar code labels (both linear and 2-dimensional) and active Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID) (Active and Passive). Passive RFID is an emerging capability in the AF.
AIT is used to capture and report data to CMOS to support additional processing. (AFI-24-203,
Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo)
Air Force Learning Committee (AFLC)— The AFLC provides senior leader guidance
regarding the focus and subject matter of Air Force programs designed to develop institutional
competencies through AF education and ancillary training. The AFLC is the “gatekeeper”
process to vet new ancillary training requirements, establish priorities, and determine efficient
delivery options for the Total Force. The strategic goal of the AFLC is to provide broad
guidance for institutional competency development to improve the focus, currency and relevancy
 222                                           AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


of Air Force curricula and training through a corporate view of AF priorities. (AFI 36-2201, Air
Force Training Program)
Associate UTC (A—UTC) – Unit manpower that provides a capability that is not captured in a
standard UTC will be postured into an “Associate” UTC (A-UTC). A-UTCs do not have a
mission capability statement and do not have a defined manpower detail. They are placeholders
for all deployable positions that cannot be described or do not fit into an existing standard
deployable UTC. (AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution)
Area of Operations (AO)— An operational area defined by the joint force commander for land
and maritime forces. Areas of operation do not typically encompass the entire operational area of
the joint force commander, but should be large enough for component commanders to
accomplish their missions and protect their forces. (JP 3-0, Joint Operations)
Area of Responsibility (AOR)— The geographical area associated with a combatant command
within which a geographic combatant commander has authority to plan and conduct operations.
(JP 1-02, DOD Dictionary of Military Terms and Associated Terms)
Augmentation Program— AFPAM 10-243 replaced the former Resource Augmentation Duty
(READY) program, AFI 10-217, with a more flexible, commander directed augmentation
program. This pamphlet contains a compilation of processes and procedures to help implement
an effective program that can assist commanders in validating, approving and documenting the
need for additional personnel resources to support installation-level requirements. Further, it can
facilitate commanders in identifying, training and tracking personnel to meet short-term
augmentee needs for installation-level exercises, contingencies, wartime, or emergency
situations/scenarios. NOTE: Use of an augmentation program is optional and each installation
will review its plans and requirements appropriately. (AFPAM 10-243, Augmentation Duty)
Air Reserve Component (ARC)— ARCs for USAF are the Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC) and the Air National Guard (ANG). AFRC stood up as a Major Command February
17th, 1997. The change in status, authorized by Congress in the Fiscal 1997 National Defense
Authorization Act, was based on the experience gained from the Air Force Reserve component
mobilization for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.
Base Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR)— BEAR is a critical Agile Combat Support
(ACS) capability. It provides vital equipment and supplies necessary to beddown and support
combat forces at expeditionary sites with limited infrastructure and support facilities. As a
minimum, each location must have a runway and parking ramp suitable for aircraft operations
and a source of water that can be made potable. (AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM)
Program Guidance and Procedures)
Basing— Actions taken to position Air Force units (on AF or non-AF property) or non-USAF
entities on USAF real property. Basing is the process used to determine the location of a unit,
manpower, mission, or activity. NOTE: The terms basing and beddown are not interchangeable.
Beddown is considered the execution of a basing action. (AFI 10-503, Strategic Basing)
Beddown— Establishing a unit, mission, activity, or personnel on real property for longer than
one year. This applies to activities of all military branches, other DOD, non-DOD federal, state
and local governmental, and/or private agencies requesting the use of Air Force real property.
Beddown is considered the execution of a basing action. (AFI 10-503)
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                          223


Cargo Deployment Function (CDF)— The installation focal point for monitoring all
deployment and redeployment cargo processing activities.
Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS)— CMOS is a combat support system that
provides automated base level processing of cargo for movement during peacetime and
deployment cargo and passenger movement during contingencies for the Air Expeditionary
Forces. CMOS is the Air Force’s designated deployment system for use at non-AMC locations
as well as those AMC locations that do not have GATES. (AMCI 24-101 V4, Military Airlift/Air
Transportation Systems Management)
Combat— Forces expected to fire weapons, conduct reconnaissance, or engage in other
activities directly related to combat operations. (AFI 10-401)
Combat Service Support (CSS)— Forces whose primary mission is to provide essential
capabilities, functions, activities, and tasks necessary to sustain all elements of combat and
combat support forces at all levels of war. (AFI 10-401)
Combat Skills Training (CST)— Standardized pre-deployment training (PDT) designed to
make all deploying Airmen proficient and comfortable with handling a weapon and working
within a team to defend themselves and their team, and to accomplish their mission.
Combat Support— Forces whose primary mission is to provide combat support to combat
forces and is a part or prepared to become a part, of a theater, command, or task force formed for
combat operations (e.g. munitions, maintenance, intelligence, weather, medical,
communications, etc.). (AFI 10-401)
Command and Control (C2)— The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. Command
and control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment,
communications, facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing,
coordinating, and controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission. Also
called C2. (JP 1-02)
Command, Control, Communications and Computer Systems (C4)— Integrated systems of
doctrine, procedures, organizational structures, personnel, equipment, facilities, and
communications designed to support a commander’s exercise of command and control across the
range of military operations. (JP 1-02)
Community Action Information Board (CAIB)— Serves as a cross-functional forum to
address installation/wing community issues and elevate issues that cannot be resolved at an
installation/wing level. The focus of the CAIB is to identify and resolve issues that impact the
readiness of members and their families, promote the perception of the Air Force as a positive
way of life, and enhance members' ability to function as productive members of the Air Force
community. The emphasis is on positive actions and programs that strengthen force readiness
and reintegration for deploying members through a sense of community to assist members and
civilians, their families and communities to thrive and successfully manage the demands of
military life (See AFI 90-501 for more details).
Compliance Inspection (CI)— Inspections conducted to assess areas mandated by law as well
as mission areas that are critical or important to the health and performance of organizations;
 224                                            AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


failure to comply with the established directives in these areas could result in legal liabilities,
penalties, or mission impact. (AFI 90-201)
Component MAJCOM (C—MAJCOM). A type of MAJCOM that is the USAF component to
a Unified Combatant Command. For example, Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) is a C-MAJCOM
that is the USAF component to United States Pacific Command (USPACOM). A C-MAJCOM is
commanded by the Commander of Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) and includes supporting
staff, one or more CNAFs (through which it presents its forces to the Combatant Commander
(CCDR)), and all assigned and attached forces. The C-MAJCOM integrates, at the strategic
level, component activities across all phases of conflict. The C-MAJCOM staff should not
duplicate the functions of the C-NAF AFFOR staff or AOC (see Figure 3.2). The C-MAJCOM
commander is the CCDR’s theater COMAFFOR and may function as a theater Joint Force Air
and Space Component Commander (JFACC) when required. Refer to AFDD2, Operations and
Organization, for additional information on component relationships and roles. NOTE: A
MAJCOM can be both a C-MAJCOM and a Lead MAJCOM. (AFI 38-101, 2.2.2.2.)
Concept Plan (CONPLAN)— In the context of joint operation planning level 3 planning detail,
an operation plan in an abbreviated format that will require considerable expansion or alteration
to convert it into a complete operation plan or operation order. Also called CONPLAN. See
also operation plan. (JP 5-0)
Contingency— A situation requiring military operations in response to natural disasters,
terrorists, subversives, or as otherwise directed by appropriate authority to protect U.S. interests.
See also contingency contracting. (JP 5-0)
Contingency Response Group (CRG)— CRGs are designed to be first responders for opening
airbases. These units will bridge the gap between the seizure forces and the follow-on
combat/expeditionary combat support forces. CRGs are critical to the AF’s ability to rapidly
deploy U.S. military forces and initiate air operations of any type in minimal time at any base or
location around the globe. CRGs will also provide C2, aerial port services, quick turn
maintenance, force protection and various airbase support capabilities for AMC’s Global
Mobility mission. (AMCI 24-101, Vol. 18, Military Airlift – AMC Mobilized Aerial Port Forces
and Aerial Delivery Flights)
Contingency Response Element (CRE)— A provisional, deployed AMC organization
established at fixed, en route, and deployed locations where AMC operational support is non-
existent or insufficient. A CRE provides continuing on-site management of AMC airfield
operations including C2, communications, aerial port, maintenance, security, force support,
weather, finance, contracting and intelligence—the critical elements needed to ensure a safe and
highly efficient air base for all tanker and airlift operations. The CRE deploys in support of
Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM), Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training
(JA/ATT), tanker support, and contingency and emergency relief missions on both planned and
“no notice” basis. A basic CRE is normally expected to support a Working Maximum Operating
on the Ground (MOG) of two aircraft with 24-hour coverage; however, with additional personnel
they can expand to handle many more aircraft as required. (AMCI 24-101, Vol. 18)
Contingency Response Team (CRT)— Performs the same functions as a CRE, but on a smaller
scale. CRTs are normally led by an enlisted 7-level member certified as a CRT chief within the
Air Mobility Control Unit (AMCU). CRTs are normally used for short duration or when there is
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                             225


a Maximum Operating on the Ground (MOG) of one aircraft with 12 hour coverage. (AMCI 24-
101, Vol. 18)
Continuum of Learning (CoL)— Designed to deliberately integrate developmental
opportunities through a common taxonomy to produce adaptable, knowledge-enabled Airmen for
today and tomorrow. (AFI 36-2201)
Contingency Operations— A military operation that is either designated by the Secretary of
Defense as a contingency operation or becomes a contingency operation as a matter of law (Title
10, United States Code, Section 101[a][13]). It is a military operation that: a. is designated by the
Secretary of Defense as an operation in which members of the Armed Forces are or might
become involved in military actions, operations, or hostilities against an enemy of the United
States or against an opposing force; or b. is created by definition of law. Under Title 10, United
States Code, Section 101 (a)(13)(B), a contingency operation exists if a military operation results
in the (1) call-up to (or retention on) active duty of members of the uniformed Services under
certain enumerated statutes (Title 10, United States Code, Sections 688, 12301[a], 12302, 12304,
12305, 12406, or 331-335); and (2) the call-up to (or retention on) active duty of members of the
uniformed Services under other (non-enumerated) statutes during war or national emergency
declared by the President or Congress. See also contingency operation. (JP 1)
Convoy— 1.) A number of merchant ships and/or naval auxiliaries usually escorted by warships
and/or aircraft--or a single merchant ship or naval auxiliary under surface escort--assembled and
organized for the purpose of passage together. (JP 3-02.1). 2.) A group of vehicles organized
for the purpose of control and orderly movement with or without escort protection that moves
over the same route at the same time and under one commander. (JP 3-02.1)
Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS)— DRRS is a capabilities-based, adaptive, near
real-time readiness reporting system. DRRS represents a shift of emphasis from readiness to
capabilities in assessing the fitness of individual units and combined forces according to mission-
essential tasks. This is in order to provide the required visibility of Air Force resources that
possess the necessary skills and capabilities to support the AEF construct as specified in defense
and contingency planning guidance, Theater Security Cooperation Guidance, the Unified
Command Plan, and National Military Strategy. (AFPD 10-2, Readiness and DOD Directive
7730.65, DOD Readiness Reporting System)
Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES)— AF’s Single
System to present, plan, source, mobilize, deploy, account for, sustain, redeploy, and reconstitute
Combatant Commanders’ Requirements. Provides integrated planning and execution support
system for operations, logistics, manpower and personnel functional communities. Integrates Air
Force planning and execution automated processes into JOPES.
Deployment— 1. In naval usage, the change from a cruising approach or contact disposition to a
disposition for battle. (JP 4-0). (DOD) 2. The movement of forces within operational areas. (JP
4-0). (DOD) 3. The positioning of forces into a formation for battle. (JP 4-0). 4. The relocation
of forces and materiel to desired operational areas. Deployment encompasses all activities from
origin or home station through destination, specifically including intra-continental United States,
inter-theater, and intra-theater movement legs, staging, and holding areas. See also deployment
order; deployment planning; PTDO. (JP 4-0)
 226                                          AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013


Deployment and Distribution Flight (LGRD)— Responsible for the centralized C2, planning,
and execution of all wing deployment operations and the distribution of cargo, passengers, and
personal property. The IDO is appointed from within LGRD. The flight is responsible for the
execution of squadron AEF Management, squadron UTC management, Expeditionary Site
Survey Process (ESSP), and Installation Deployment Planning. LGRD also operates the DCC,
RCC, and IDRC, as necessary. This flight is also responsible for the management of the
installation/wing’s WRM, and Support Agreements. Additionally, the flight is the single
installation transportation authority responsible for planning, managing and executing the
movement of personnel; the shipment and receipt for DOD cargo during day-to-day and
contingency operations; acquisition and arrangement of Personal Property movement services
and operate Small Air Terminals for Cargo and Passenger Movement functions at locations with
no Aerial Port Squadron or other host support. (AFI 38-101)
Deployment Availability (DAV) Codes— Personnel codes that identify an individual's current
medical, legal and administrative status for deployment eligibility.
Deployment Control Center (DCC)— The installation focal point for deployment operations.
The DCC is responsible for all command and control requirements.
Deployment Echelon— A capability within a UTC that commanders must deploy as a single
entity. Deployment echelons facilitate deployment planning by identifying a unit's capabilities,
materiel and personnel requirements and designating the sequence of movement (JCS Pub 6,
Volume V, Part 4; MEFPAK or LOGMOD System Help).
Deployment Work Centers— Activities activated during deployments or exercises that process
deploying personnel and equipment. These work centers include the deployment control center,
cargo processing function, and the Personnel Deployment Function.
Designed Operational Capabilities (DOC) Statement— Document prepared by a parent
MAJCOM that outlines each measured unit's capabilities and contains the unit's identification,
mission tasking narrative, mission specifics, and measurable resources. The DOC statement is
used for the purposes of organizing, training and equipping the unit. It is not a tasking document
for crisis operations (See MISCAP).
Emergency Essential (E-E)— Civilian Employee – A direct-hire U.S. citizen civilian employee
who is appointed, either temporarily or permanently, to an E-E DOD position. Such employees
must sign DD Form 2365, DOD Civilian Employee Overseas Emergency-Essential Position
Agreement.
Emergency-Essential (E-E) Civilian Employee— A direct-hire U.S. citizen civilian employee
who is appointed, either temporarily or permanently, to an E-E DoD position. Such employees
must sign DD Form 2365, DoD Civilian Employee Overseas Emergency-Essential Position
Agreement.
Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS)— A subset of ACS that responds quickly, is highly
mobile, technologically superior, robust, flexible, and fully integrated with operations. ECS is
the deployed ACS capability to provide persistent and effective support for the applications of
Air and Space power on a global basis. (AFDD 4-0, Combat Support)
Expeditionary Site Survey Process (ESSP)— a subset of the overall expeditionary site
planning process and serves as the foundation for Air Force expeditionary operations. ESSP
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                            227


provides detailed information for use by planners at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels
while assisting site survey teams in prioritizing their site selection and bed-down actions. The
objectives of BSPs and ESPs are therefore to determine installation capabilities and ensure a well
documented, de-conflicted and standardized approach towards bed-down and reception support
for tasked OPLANs. (AFI 10-404)
Expeditionary Skills (ES)— Defined as the knowledge, skills and abilities (KSA) required of a
deployment-ready Airman essential to prepare Airmen to survive, operate, and succeed in a
deployed environment, while reinforcing a strong warrior ethos. These skills are obtained
through a tiered training approach and target KSAs not routinely acquired during occupational
and/or other Ancillary Training venues. ES must be relevant, synchronized, standardized and
integrated across the AF to provide CCDR with Airmen trained to support that theater’s
requirements, while maximizing resources. ES training is optimized when incorporated as a
continuum across an Airman’s career and aligned with mission tasking and deployments. (AFI
36-2201)

intertheater traffic. (JP 3-17, Air Mobility Operations)
Inter-theater Airlift— The common-user airlift linking theaters to the continental United States
and to other theaters as well as the airlift within the continental United States. The majority of
these air mobility assets are assigned to the Commander, United States Transportation
Command. Because of the inter-theater ranges usually involved, inter-theater airlift is normally
conducted by the heavy, longer range, intercontinental airlift assets but may be augmented with
shorter range aircraft when required. Commonly referred to as “strategic airlift.” (JP 3-17)
In-Transit Visibility (ITV)— (DOD) The ability to track the identity, status, and location of
DOD units, and non-unit cargo (excluding bulk petroleum, oils, and lubricants) and passengers;

equipment force packages. MEFPAK, which resides in DCAPES, comprises two subsystems:
the Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) and the Logistics Force Packaging System
(LOGFOR). (AFI 10-401)
Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR)— A MEFPAK subsystem that provides: 1)
the title of the unit or force element and its unique Joint Chiefs of Staff Unit Type Code, 2) the
mission capability statement (MISCAP) containing the definition of a UTC’s capability, and 3)
the manpower detail by function, grade (officers only), and Air Force specialty code required to
meet the defined capability.
Maximum on Ground (MOG)— There are two primary types of MOG – parking MOG and
working MOG. Although the term MOG literally refers to the maximum number of aircraft
which can be accommodated on the airfield (i.e. parking MOG), it is often referred to the
working MOG (i.e. maximum number of aircraft which can be simultaneously “worked” by
maintenance, aerial port, etc.), fuel MOG (i.e. maximum number of aircraft which can be
simultaneously refueled) and/or other constraining factors. To clarify, parking MOG is the total
number of wide-body (i.e. C-5, C-17, KC-10, KC-46, DC-10, MD-11, B747, B767, L-1011,
A310, etc.) aircraft that can be parked at an air facility. Working MOG refers to how many
parked aircraft can be on/off-loaded, serviced and prepared for departure. MHE, such as trucks,
buses, and other surface transport vehicles, road networks, aircraft support equipment, fuel
tankers, sufficient number of trained load team personnel, and other factors affect working
MOG. Ideally, working MOG equals parking MOG. When it does not, backlogs can occur
whereby creating LIMFACs. NOTE: Narrow body aircraft consists of the B757, DC-8, C-130
and the KC-135.
Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP)— A short paragraph describing the mission
capabilities that higher headquarters planners expect of a specific UTC at execution. The
statement usually contains pertinent information such as the type of base where commanders will
deploy the unit, the unit's functional activities, and other augmentation requirements necessary to
conduct specific missions.

effectiveness and their associated criteria of performance that support all levels of DoD in
executing the NMS across the full ROMO. (AFPD 10-2)
Numbered/Named Air Force (NAF)— A level of command directly under a MAJCOM. NAFs
provide operational leadership and supervision. A NAF is assigned subordinate units, such as

automated procedures, systems, hardware, personnel agencies, and deployable teams to
accomplish total force accountability, casualty reporting, strength reporting, and personnel
program support. Total force accountability is primary mission of PERSCO—providing
personnel support to the warfighter. (AFDD 1-2)
Planning Subsystem (LOGPLAN)— The Planning Subsystem (LOGPLAN) is an unclassified
module (within the Logistics Module) that assists with base-level deployment planning.
Plan Identification (PID) Number— 1. A command unique four-digit number followed by a
suffix indicating the JSCP year for which the plan is written. 2. A five-digit number representing
a command -unique four-digit identifier, followed by a one-character, alphabetic suffix
indicating the operation plan option, or a one-digit number numeric value indicating the JSCP
year for which the plan is written. (JP 1-02)
Post Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA)— Each redeploying Airman must complete a
Post-Deployment Health Assessment using the revised Post-Deployment Health Assessment
Form (DD Form 2796, DHA#2). Completion of the DD Form 2796 is a key component of the
PDHA process and must include a face-to-face interview with a trained health care provider.
Directed at the individual’s health status and concerns at redeployment, the screening is also
used to document health events and enhance future force health.
Post Deployment Health Reassessment (PDHRA)— The PDHRA process and screener (DD
Form 2900, DHA#3)) are conducted 90-180 days after redeployment. The PDHRA is not a
psychological screening, but a health risk appraisal modeled after the existing pre- and post-
health assessment.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                         233


Pre-Deployment Health Assessment— The Pre-Deployment Health Assessment Form (DD
Form 2795, DHA#1) is a mandatory form that allows military personnel to record information
about their general health and share any concerns they have prior to redeployment. It also helps
health care providers identify issues and provide medical before deployment. The DD Form
2795 is mandatory for deploying military personnel from every Service, including Reserve
component personnel and DOD civilian personnel. DD Form 2795 is to be completed and
validated within 120-days prior to deployment.

CCDR for planning that would adversely affect the command’s ability to accomplish its mission.
(JP 5-0); (AF) the lack of forces, equipment, personnel, materiel or capability, reflected as the
difference between the resources identified as a plan requirement (or Service asset) and those
apportioned to a CCDR (or assigned to the Service) for planning that would adversely affect the
command’s ability to accomplish its mission. (AFI 10-401)
Small-scale contingencies (SSCs)— “...swift intervention by military forces might be the best
way to contain, resolve, or mitigate the consequences of a conflict that could otherwise become
far more costly and deadly. These operations encompass the full range of joint military
operations beyond peacetime engagement activities but short of major theater warfare and
include: show-of-force operations, interventions, limited strikes, noncombatant evacuation

                                      DEPLOYMENT AVAILABILITY (DAV) CODES

       A2.1. DAV codes reside in MilPDS and indicate personnel deployment availability. DAVs fall
       within one of four categories: Legal, Time, Physical and Administrative. The deferment of a
       group will be removed or modified by the authority which granted the original deferment. The
       reasons for deferment are addressed in the notes portion of Table A2.1. or within the governing
       guidance for applicable DAV Codes. For example, medical instructions prescribe which
       injuries, illnesses, or diseases render an Airman ineligible for deployment, and the duration of
       the deferment. Therefore, that medical instruction authorizes temporary deferment for medical
       conditions. Commanders will coordinate with the deferment authority to remove non-waiverable
       AAC, ALC or DAV codes prior to their scheduled expiration
       A2.2. DAV Reports. UDMs will obtain Base Level Service Delivery Module Information
       Technology (BLSDM-IT) in order to periodically review DAV code changes for personnel
       assigned to the unit. Before assigning personnel to deployment taskings, the tasking authority
       must screen individual DAV codes (if applicable) to verify that the individual has no
       discriminating legal, time, physical, or administrative factors that could render them ineligible to
       deploy or that current DAV code will expire prior to first movement. NOTE: MilPDS is the
       authoritative system for all DAV codes. See Personnel Services Delivery Guide at the following
       for more information: .

*Note 1: Deployment deferments for individuals with AAC 34 and ALC Q are not automatic.
Individuals that have an AAC 34 and ALC Q can apply for deployment deferment IAW AFI 36-
2110, not to exceed 12 months. Base level IPRs will update DAV upon receiving approval email
from AFPC/DPAPPH.

*Note 2: Code operationally defers key and critical personnel assigned to an Institutional Force
organization. Expiration date will be equal to either (1) DOA submitted by commander or
equivalent or (2) DOA of 6 months from the RDD for approved Severe Mission Impact reclama.
Code is intended for use when no other DAV code applies and the deferment is personal in nature
rather than mission-driven. Examples will include but are not limited to extreme family or
financial issues (i.e. child custody battles, loss of home to natural disaster, etc.).

*Note 3: Indicates member has accrued individual dwell time (IDT). Review OSD and supporting
AF policies to determine eligibility. See AIG 8106 Field Message, IDT and DAV Code 81 Release,
8 Apr 11: Completion of any contingency deployment (TDY type 1 and DS 20) automatically
establishes a DAV Code 81 in MilPDS. Decision makers will use IDT/DAV Code 81 as planning
tools to determine if an Airman has minimum dwell based on most recent operational deployment or
if a dwell waiver is required. IDT/DAV Code 81 expiration dates must be prior to the ALD of the
next proposed operational deployment.
Time on Station (TOS) minimums:
Assigned OS on a short tour…………………………………….15-days
Assigned in the CONUS or OS on a long tour………………….45-days
Assigned in the CONUS or OS, and was assigned from an unaccompanied short tour,
365-day TDY, or CONUS isolated station…..……..…………….6 months

*Note 4: These TOS minimums allow military members and their families who have made a
recent PCS move or returned from an extended TDY to satisfy essential post-PCS/TDY military
processing, to arrange their personal affairs, and to otherwise stabilize family needs. Personnel
with less than the minimum TOS are not available for deployment. However, unit commanders
can waive the 15-day and 45-day TOS minimums based upon mission needs. Waiver authority for
the 6-month TOS minimum is the MAJCOM/CV. DAV Code 57 is an automatic update based on
DAS or AAC 39 update. AFI 36-2110 allows for AAC 39 to be updated for a period greater than
6 months for assignment deferment purposes only which change the expiration date of DAV Code
57 to a date greater than the 6 months authorized for deployment deferment. IPRs might have to
do manual calculations to determine if it has been greater than 6 months since a member‘s last
deployment TDY return date. If it has been greater than 6 months, no formal waiver is required.

      assigned to AF installations and agencies. Please contact the MTF, Public Health/Force
      Health Management Office for guidance and location-specific medical requirements.
      Due to the complexity and sensitive nature of the medical clearance process,
      commanders, IDOs, and UDMs will ensure appropriate time is allocated during the duty
      day for deploying members to go to the MTF to accomplish their deployment medical
      requirements prior to the PDF. COCOM reporting instructions are subject to change and
      updated based on the assessment of current medical threats – additional medical
      requirements may be added to ensure protection of deploying personnel.
      A3.15.1.2. All DOD Civilians entering theater for 30 days or more must report to
      PH/FHM 120 days prior to their scheduled departure date to be medically cleared. DOD
      civilians must comply with DoDI 6490.07; Deployment-Limiting Medical Conditions for
      Service Members and DOD Civilian Employees, 5 Feb 2010, CCDR Reporting
      Instructions, and the medical requirements listed below. DOD Civilians must also bring
      an OF-178, Certificate of Medical Examination, to PH/FHM with Part B completed by
      the Appointing Officer prior to medical clearance. Note: DOD civilians who report to
      the MTF without an OF-178 or Part B completed will be returned to their unit. PH/FHM
      will schedule an appointment (same day if available) with an MTF physician to conduct
      the medical examination and document any deployment limiting medical conditions.
      Individuals who fail to report to PH/FHM or complete these medical requirements will
      not be cleared to deploy. DOD Civilians must in-process PH/FHM within 5 days of
      return from theater to complete required medical screening and post deployment health
      assessments.

                             CARGO CATEGORY CODES (CCC)

A6.1. This code identifies the types of cargo for force or non unit-related cargo requirements.
The cargo category code consist of three characters. Each character position has unique codes
and meanings (Ref: CJCSM 3150.16C). The following tables list valid codes and meanings for
each character position. NOTE: Second character position codes are different between force and
non unit cargo categories.

Table A6.1. First Position CCCs – Identifies CargoType
       Vehicles (wheeled and tracked, self-propelled or non-self-propelled) that are neither
       security nor hazardous cargo (see codes K and L for security and hazardous vehicles) and
A
       are not suitable for road marching on overland deployment legs. See code R for road
       capable vehicles.
       Non-self-deploying aircraft (NSDA) that are uncrated (if self-deployable aircraft will not be
B      deployed under their own power, they are identified as NSDA and their force movement
       characteristics reported).
C      Floating craft.
D      Hazardous non-vehicular cargo. (See code E).
E      Security non-vehicular cargo or non-vehicular cargo that is both security and hazardous.
F      Cargo requiring refrigeration by the mover.
G      Bulk POL (non-packaged)-fuel contained in unit tankers.
H      Bulk granular cargo; crushed rock, sand, etc.
J      Other non-vehicular cargo, including water, packaged POL, crated aircraft, etc.
K      Vehicles designated as security cargo or both security and hazardous cargo.
L      Vehicles designated as hazardous cargo but not security cargo.
M      Ammunition.
N      Nuclear weapons.
P      Chemical munitions.
       Wheeled vehicles (self-propelled or non-self-propelled), neither security nor hazardous
R      cargo, that are suitable for road march on overland deployment legs and capable of convoy
       speeds up to 40 MPH.

Table A6.2. Second Position CCCs – Specifies Cargo Extension
    Non-Air-Transportable Cargo: Cargo that exceeds any of the dimensions 1,453 inches x 216
0
    inches x 156 inches and the width exceeds 144 inches.
    Outsized cargo: Cargo that exceeds the dimensions of oversized cargo and requires the use of
1   aircraft such as a C-5 or C-17 or surface transportation. An item exceeds 1,000 inches long by
    117 inches wide by 105 inches high in any one dimension.
    Oversized cargo: Cargo that exceeds the usable dimension of a 463L pallet loaded to the design
    height of 96 inches, but equal to or less than 1,000 inches in length, 117 inches in width, and 105
2
    inches in height. This cargo is air transportable on aircraft such as the C-5, C-17, C-130, KC-10
    and most civilian contract cargo carriers.

       REPORTING UNIT LEVEL UNIT TYPE CODE (UTC) DATA TO JOPES

A8.1. Reporting Unit Level UTC Data to JOPES.
   A8.1.1. At the direction of the parent MAJCOM, wings will electronically pass their
   LOGMOD-generated “DCAPES Schedule Export” files to their MAJCOM.             Parent
   MAJCOMs must make the determination when their units send these files. For example,
   when there are very limited or no changes to the standard UTC, a LOGMOD-generated
   “DCAPES Schedule Export” file would not be required. When there are major end-
   item/increment level changes/tailoring, the LOGMOD-generated “DCAPES Plan Export”
   would be required. When required, ANG units will send their files to NGB/A3X for
   subsequent forwarding to gaining MAJCOMs or direct import into DCAPES.
   A8.1.2. Prior to importing the LOGMOD-generated “DCAPES Schedule Export” or
   “DCAPES Plan Export” files into DCAPES, MAJCOMs will ensure UTCs/ULNs match
   TPFDD UTC/ULNs. Deploying units (with cargo) will only send files for ULNs with
   tailored UTCs.
   A8.1.3. Supporting MAJCOMs must ensure the LOGMOD-generated “DCAPES Schedule
   Export” or “DCAPES Plan Export” file (provided from the base) are imported into DCAPES
   prior to providing TPFDD verification to the supported commander. Once the supported
   commander provides TPFDD validation to USTRANSCOM, the UTC/ULN will be locked
   and cannot be updated.
   A8.1.4. MAJCOMs are authorized to provide additional guidance for MAJCOM specific
   requirements.

                     *DEPLOYMENT MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS

A20.1. Deployment medical requirements include all medical requirements prescribed for
deployments in DODIs, AFIs, CCDR reporting instructions, and other applicable policies.
A20.2. Deployment medical requirements span the pre- and post-deployment cycle and include
various requirements, which may vary based on the deployer’s component (e.g., Active Duty,
ARC, Air Force civilian, or contractor). NOTE: MTFs will not process contractors for
deployment, unless the deploying individual’s contract specifically states that medical services
must be provided. The installation/wing must provide reimbursement (e.g., funding and/or
manpower) to the MTF for providing contractually required deployment-related medical
clearance services to deploying contractors. A copy of the contract containing exact medical
specifications must be provided to the PH/Force Health Management Office prior to initiation of
any medical clearance activities or services.
   A20.2.1. DOD civilians are subject to the medical, dental, and psychological requirements
   established by federal law, DODI and the CCDR responsible for the deployment AOR, both
   prior to and including the entire period of their deployment.
   A20.2.2. Civilian Personnel Services (Human Resources) will coordinate with installation
   medical authorities and deployment processing representatives to establish local civilian-
   deployment procedures that comply with this directive. When possible, civilians will be
   integrated into existing pre- and post-deployment medical clearance programs.
A20.3. IAW DOD and Air Force policy, five Deployment Health Assessments (DHAs) must be
completed at specific intervals throughout the deployment cycle. The five DHA requirements
are outlined in figure A20.1.
   A20.3.1. The DHA process includes two steps: 1). Electronic completion of the prescribed
   DHA form via ASIMS Web (paper forms will not be accepted), and 2). A face-to-face
   (person-to-person for ARC personnel) interview with a healthcare provider. NOTE:
   Personnel will remain on their unit’s due/overdue action list in ASIMS Web until they
   complete both steps of the DHA process.
   A20.3.2. IAW DODI 6490.03, Deployment Health, all DOD civilian employees must
   complete pre- and post-deployment health assessments consistent with requirements for
   military personnel to effectively identify and evaluate deployment-related health concerns.
   AF MTFs may be used for administration of DHAs; however, the employee’s organization of
   record is responsible for DHA compliance, tracking, and monitoring.
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                                    307

*If not completed in theater, DHA #2 must be completed within 30 days of return from deployment

**Cannot be completed within 90 days of previous DHA

***Active Duty and ARC personnel only; DHAs #4 and #5 are not required for DOD civilian personnel 
*NOTE: If a member deploys again before completing DHA #3, #4, or #5, the DHA requirements will be
reset for the next deployment. The reset goes into effect when DHA #1 is completed for the upcoming
deployment. Until DHA #1 is completed, the member will remain due for DHAs for the previous
deployment.


A20.4. Compliance with deployment medical requirements of assigned personnel is a
commander’s responsibility. Installation/wing commanders will ensure subordinate-level
commanders maintain IMR and deployment medical requirements on their assigned personnel.
    A20.4.1. While MTFs are responsible for providing access to care, commanders must work
    closely with MTFs to ensure Airmen receive timely care and support for health care needs.
A20.5. Pre-Deployment Medical Clearance
    A20.5.1. The UDM will (upon receipt of deployment tasking):
        A20.5.1.1. Review Medical Profile (AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition Report)
        status of deploying members for mobility restrictions and remove members with mobility
        restriction(s) listed on the AF 469 (coded 81 - Pregnancy, 37 - Medical Evaluation Board,
        31 – Illness or Injury) from deployment. UDMs will use ASIMS Web to access profile
        information. NOTE: Members with mobility restrictions annotated on the AF 469
        should not be deployed. Commanders wishing to deploy a Service member on a mobility
        restricting profile can request a medical waiver through the appropriate COCOM. The
        commander should consult the medical senior profile officer for further guidance on
        medical waivers.
        A20.5.1.2. Notify PH/FHM of deployment tasking via certified DRMD, certified tasking
        order, memo signed by commander, or official e-mail).
        A20.5.1.3. Provide PH/FHM a by-name listing of members tasked to deploy. List must
        contain: last name, first name, middle initial, social security number, and estimated
        RDD. NOTE: Only members officially tasked to deploy will be medically cleared by
        PH/FHM.

      A20.5.1.4. Ensure deploying unit member(s) initiate the pre-deployment medical
      clearance process with PH/FHM 120 days prior to deployment date or date of first
      movement (e.g., training attendance) to complete pre-deployment medical clearance
      requirements. NOTE: Short-notice taskings may require expedited medical clearance.
      Consult with PH/FHM for installation-specific guidance on the expedited medical
      clearance process.
      A20.5.1.5. Advise personnel with any type of medical allergies to obtain the appropriate
      documentation from the MTF in order to acquire a Red Metal (Medical) Alert ID (if
      available).
      A20.5.1.6. Ensure, when identified by PH/FHM through the DMC Module in ASIMS
      Web, deploying Service member promptly completes the DHA #1 (DD Form 2795).
      A20.5.1.7. The DMC Module of ASIMS Web (https://imr.afms.mil/imr/loginunit.aspx)
      will be used to monitor and track unit member’s medical clearance status until completion.
  A20.5.2. The Individual Member will (upon notification by UDM):
      A20.5.2.1. At any point during the clearance process and prior to deployment, notify
      commander of any medical condition(s) that may limit their ability to deploy. NOTE:
      Personnel on a mobility restricting medical profile must see a medical provider prior to
      reporting to PH/FHM for medical clearance.
      A20.5.2.2. When notified by UDM, log on to My IMR in ASIMS Web
      (https://imr.afms.mil/imr/MyIMR.aspx) and complete DHA #1 (DD Form 2795)
      electronically. Paper copies of the DHA will not be accepted by PH/FHM. PRP and PSP
      must complete DHA forms at the MTF. NOTE: Personnel can also access My IMR via
      the AF Portal. Under “Featured Links,” select “Deployment & Readiness,” select
      “Medical Readiness-Deployment Health,” and then select the link for DHA #1 (Pre-
      Deployment Health Assessment, DD Form 2795).
         A20.5.2.2.1. An appointment with a credentialed, trained health care provider is
         required to complete the DHA process.
      A20.5.2.3. Obtain Installation Deployment Out-Processing Checklist from UDM and/or
      IPR. Deployment out-processing must include completion of requirements outlined
      Table A20.2., Pre-Deployment Medical Requirements Checklist.
      A20.5.2.4. Report to PH/FHM to complete deployment medical clearance processing
      IAW CCDR and other reporting instruction requirements.
      A20.5.2.5. Upon completion of medical clearance process, have PH/FHM sign and date
      the Installation Deployment Out-Processing Checklist.
  A20.5.3. Pre-Deployment Medical Clearance for DOD Civilians:
      A20.5.3.1. All DOD civilians entering theater for more than 30 days will be medically
      cleared for deployment prior to departure from their home station (or designated
      deployment processing center). Medical clearances must comply with DODI 6490.07,
      Deployment-Limiting Medical Conditions for Service Members and DOD Civilian
      Employees, DODI, 6490.03, Deployment Health, and respective CCDR Reporting
AFI10-403_USAFESUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                     309


     Instructions. Individuals who fail to comply with these requirements will not be cleared
     to deploy.
     A20.5.3.2. DOD civilians must bring an OF-178, Certificate of Medical Examination, to
     PH/FHM, with Part B completed by the Appointing Officer. DOD civilians who report
     to the MTF without an OF-178 and a completed Part B will be returned to their unit.
     PH/FHM will schedule an appointment (same day if available) with an MTF physician to
     conduct the medical examination and to document any deployment limiting medical
     conditions. Individuals who fail to report to PH/FHM or complete these medical
     requirements will not be cleared to deploy.
     A20.5.3.3. Civilians who wish to deploy, but have a deployment-limiting medical
     condition as defined in DODI 6490.07, must submit medical documentation required for
     waiver to the CCDR (or designee), to determine if the condition can be reasonably
     accommodated in theater. In certain instances, a wavier may not be possible due to
     limited scope of care at a deployed location. Civilians who fail to disclose a diagnosed
     deployment limiting medical condition during the pre-deployment medical clearance
     process, and arrive in theater without waiver, may be returned to home station at their
     own expense. NOTE: Civilians who develop a deployment-limiting medical condition
     while in theater that cannot be resolved must also obtain a medical waiver in order to
     remain in theater. Designated medical authorities may direct the curtailment of a DOD
     civilian’s deployment, if the medical condition cannot be resolved or reasonably
     accommodated.
  A20.5.4. PH/FHM will:
     A20.5.4.1. Create deployment records in the DMC Module of ASIMS Web and
     update/monitor the medical clearance status of deploying members in DMC.
        A20.5.4.1.1. Use the DMC Module of ASIMS Web to track and to monitor Service
        members, DOD civilians, and contractors.
     A20.5.4.2. Provide IDO, IPR and UDM with location-specific medical requirements and
     guidance IAW DODI, CCDR, and reporting instructions.
     A20.5.4.3. Initiate medical clearance process for deploying member (within 120 days
     prior to deployment or date first movement) IAW DODI, CCDR, and reporting
     instructions.
     A20.5.4.4. Verify IMR and medical profile (AF Form 469) status of member.
     A20.5.4.5. Ensure all deployment-specific medical requirements are visible on the
     ASIMS- generated DD Form 2766 print-out before sealing record.
     A20.5.4.6. Provide medical threat briefing to deploying member(s).
     A20.5.4.7. Communicate to member and UDM deployment deficiencies that could limit
     member’s ability to obtain medical clearance for deployment.
     A20.5.4.8. Verify electronic completion of DHA #1 (DD Form 2795).
     A20.5.4.9. Verify all pre-deployment medical clearance requirements are complete, and
     sign the deployer’s installation out-processing checklist (see Table A20.2).
