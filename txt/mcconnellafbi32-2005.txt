SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: implements updated governing directives, identifies current Core Vehicle Set for
Category 5, sets and defines current Level of Service (LOS) and influencing factors, updates
staffing measures and establishes notification procedures.
1. Requirements. DoDI 6055.06, the Fire and Emergency Services Program establishes the
minimum requirements for firefighting agent delivery. Applying this standard to McConnell
AFB, the required agent delivery for a KC-135/KC-46 is 7,780 gallons of agent to an aircraft
incident occurring on the runways and overruns. The required agent delivery for a B-747 is
9,570 gallons of agent to an aircraft incident occurring on the runways and overruns. We make
this delineation due to the military and unique civilian aircraft that transient McConnell
AFB. In addition, DoDI 6055.06 requires an Aggregate Response Time (ART) for unannounced
aircraft emergencies of 5 minutes for the first arriving ARFF vehicle. All additional ARFF
vehicles should arrive at 30 second intervals thereafter, which will achieve the gallonage
requirements set forth above. The ART is a total of 1 minute dispatch time, 1 minute turnout
time, and 3 minutes travel time. The time is elapsed from the receipt of the emergency alarm to
when the units arrive on scene.
2. Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting Vehicles. Allowance Standard Code 010 provides the
authorization for a core vehicle set that includes ARFF, structural and firefighting support
vehicles for an installation. McConnell AFB was previously identified as a Core Vehicle Set 4
(See Table 1) for the mission assigned KC-135 aircraft and required 7,780 gallons of firefighting
agent on an aircraft incident. The addition of the KC-46 aircraft to McConnell AFB would not
change the gallonage requirement. We have increased our Core Vehicle Set to a Set 5 based on
the amount of time that the B-747 frequents McConnell AFB. With the revision to 44EF00 AF
Manpower Standard and the MAJCOM approved Vehicle Set increase, McConnell AFB Fire and
Emergency Services Flight gained an additional 3 unfunded manpower authorizations. The
ARFF vehicles are assigned accordingly to deliver the required firefighting agent to an aircraft
emergency site. Based on the ARFF vehicles assigned, the total ARFF agent available at
McConnell is 9,600 gallons. Currently the proper vehicle authorization and manning is not
provided for a Vehicle Set 5 (See Table 2). At maximum availability, all vehicles will be
placed in-service during statistically high-risk periods. (See Table 3) In this example, the period
from 0700 – 1800 is the higher risk period and accounts for over 67 percent of the Air Force total
emergency responses. Note that this chart represents the average responses for a year, which
includes holiday periods. Considered separately, holiday periods are very low risk.

3. KC-135 /KC-46 Levels of Service. The Air Force has determined that each FES flight will
provide a level of service (LOS) commensurate with the risk. The LOS is expressed as the
Optimum Level of Service (OLS), Reduced Level of Service (RLS), Critical Level of Service
(CLS) and Inadequate Level of Service (ILS) per AFI 32-2001. The ARFF capabilities fall into
one of these four LOS. The levels explained below and the (ARFF Capability Matrix
Attachment 2) was developed to aid commanders in making operational decisions when ARFF
capability is degraded.
     3.1. OPTIMUM Level of Service. ARFF capability is at or above 90% (≥7,000 gallons
     water) of agent requirement for a Vehicle Set 4 (KC-135/KC-46). The FES flight can
     support all airfield operations including aircrew rescue and interior fire fighting operations.
     3.2. REDUCED Level of Service. ARFF capability is between 89% - 50% (6,999 - 3,900
     gallons water) of agent requirement for a Vehicle Set 4 (KC-135/KC-46). This level of FES
     capability exceeds the critical but is less than the optimum level of service. During this level,
     adequate firefighting capability can be provided by utilizing selective response and adjusted
     fire ground tactics. At the RLS, fire fighting forces should be successful in offensive fire
     attack operations, search and rescue, and property conservation; however, operations may not
     be sustainable throughout an event without additional resources. Degraded capability to
     mount an effective aircraft interior firefighting attack and a delayed initiation of aircrew
     rescue may be expected. High probability of defensive fire operations only.
MCCONNELLAFBI 32-2005 8 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                            5


   3.3. CRITICAL Level of Service. ARFF capability is between 49% - 42% (< 3,899 - 3,300
   gallons water) of agent requirement for a Vehicle Set 4 (KC-135/KC-46). CLS is the
   absolute minimum LOS and should only be allowed for short durations. Consider curtailing
   aircraft launches to high priority missions only. Curtail or consider stopping aircraft
   maintenance activities through consultation with the Installation Fire Chief (IFC). Extremely
   limited capability to mount an effective interior fire attack on a large/medium frame aircraft
   and aircrew may be required to perform self-rescue. Extremely high probability firefighting
   will be limited to defensive operations only. Consider issuance of NOTAM detailing lack of
   effective airfield firefighting capabilities.
3.4. INADEQUATE Level of Service. ARFF capability is at or below 41% (≤ 3,299 gallons
water) of agent requirement for a Vehicle Set 4. This level of service represents limited rescue
capability and increased risk/loss potential due to limited resources. Successful outcomes can
only be expected when the incident can be quickly mitigated. Firefighters are expected to revert
to defensive operations when the emergency cannot be quickly contained. The aircraft involved
in the fire is expected to be destroyed. Consider curtailing aircraft launches to high priority
missions only. Curtail or consider stopping aircraft maintenance activities through consultation
with the IFC. Extremely limited capability to mount an effective interior fire attack on a
large/medium frame aircraft and aircrew may be required to perform self-rescue. Extremely high
probability firefighting will be limited to defensive operations only. Consider issuance of
NOTAM detailing lack of effective airfield firefighting capabilities.
4. B-747 Levels of Service. The Air Force has determined that each FES flight will provide a
level of service (LOS) commensurate with the risk. The LOS is expressed as the Optimum Level
of Service (OLS), Reduced Level of Service (RLS), Critical Level of Service (CLS) and
Inadequate Level of Service (ILS) per AFI 32-2001. The ARFF capabilities fall into one of these
four LOS. The levels explained below and the (ARFF Capability Matrix Attachment 3) was
developed to aid commanders in making operational decisions when ARFF capability is
degraded.
   4.1. OPTIMUM Level of Service. ARFF capability is at or above 90% (≥8,600 gallons
   water) of agent requirement for a Vehicle Set 5. The FES flight can support all airfield
   operations including aircrew rescue and interior firefighting operations.
   4.2. REDUCED Level of Service. ARFF capability is between 89% - 50% (8,599 - 4,800
   gallons water) of agent requirement for a Vehicle Set 5. This level of FES capability exceeds
   the critical but is less than the optimum level of service. During this level, adequate
   firefighting capability can be provided by utilizing selective response and adjusted fire
   ground tactics. At the RLS, fire fighting forces should be successful in offensive fire attack
   operations, search and rescue, and property conservation; however, operations may not be
   sustainable throughout an event without additional resources. Degraded capability to mount
   an effective aircraft interior firefighting attack and a delayed initiation of aircrew rescue may
   be expected. High probability of defensive fire operations only.
   4.3. CRITICAL Level of Service. ARFF capability is between 49% - 34% (≤ 4,799 - 3,300
   gallons water) of agent requirement for a Vehicle Set 5. CLS is the absolute minimum LOS
   and should only be allowed for short durations. The aircraft involved in the fire is expected to
   receive severe damage. Therefore, operating at CLS continuously for periods of more than
   72 hours is prohibited without a written Risk Management (RM) plan signed by the

     Installation or Wing Commander. Consider curtailing aircraft launches to high priority
     missions only. Curtail or consider stopping aircraft maintenance activities through
     consultation with the Installation Fire Chief (IFC). Extremely limited capability to mount an
     effective interior fire attack on a large/medium frame aircraft and aircrew may be required to
     perform self-rescue. Extremely high probability firefighting will be limited to defensive
     operations only. Consider issuance of NOTAM detailing lack of effective airfield
     firefighting capabilities.
4.4. INADEQUATE Level of Service. ARFF capability is at or below 33% (≤ 3,299 gallons
water) of agent requirement for a Vehicle Set 5. This level of service represents limited rescue
capability and increased risk/loss potential due to limited resources. Successful outcomes can
only be expected when the incident can be quickly mitigated. Firefighters are expected to revert
to defensive operations when the emergency cannot be quickly contained. The aircraft involved
in the fire is expected to be destroyed. Consider curtailing aircraft launches to high priority
missions only. Curtail or consider stopping aircraft maintenance activities through consultation
with the IFC. Extremely limited capability to mount an effective interior fire attack on a
large/medium frame aircraft and aircrew may be required to perform self-rescue. Extremely high
probability firefighting will be limited to defensive operations only. Consider issuance of
NOTAM detailing lack of effective airfield firefighting capabilities.
5. Influencing Factors. Three factors impact the flight's ability to provide Aircraft Rescue Fire
Fighting capability: Manning, ARFF vehicle availability and emergency response to non-aircraft
related emergencies.
     5.1. Air Force Manning Standard 44EF00. Manpower requirements are based on the risk
     assumptions that incidents involving real property material and aircraft will not occur
     simultaneously except when they are involved in the same incident. The manpower standard
     also states that “actual assignment of personnel for all vehicles will be provided through
     cross-staffing.” Cross-staffing is the practice of assigning personnel to multiple vehicles.
     Personnel respond with the vehicle most appropriate for the emergency response.
        5.1.1. Personnel Qualifications. The FES must have personnel with the correct
        qualifications to provide the required fire protection at an incident. DODI 6055.06
        requires specific training and certification for each functional position on an incident
        prior to a person performing its role. This may include proper vehicle licensing, skill
        level (3, 5, 7 or 9-level) and firefighter certifications (i.e. Driver Operator-ARFF, Fire
        Officer III, Rescue/Confined Space/Hazardous Materials Technicians, Incident
        Commander, AFIMS, etc.). Cross-staffing levies additional requirements on individuals
        which may not be filled with new or less experienced personnel. The proper mix of
        firefighters is required and directly affects the ARFF capability and LOS provided.
        5.1.2. Mobility Requirements. All FES military positions are assigned to a Prime Base
        Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) unit type code (UTC) position, i.e. 4FPFP, 4FPFJ or
        4FPFN. A large number of firefighters may be tasked for deployments which could
        significantly affect the LOS. (See Table 4)

        (1) 4FPFN UTC
      1 Senior Firefighter

   5.2. ARFF Vehicles. The highest priority must be placed on maintaining ARFF vehicles in
   commission to achieve the 9,570 gallon agent delivery requirement for the B-747 and the
   7,780 gallon agent delivery requirement for the KC-135/KC-46. Force Activity Designator
   codes for fire fighting vehicles, equipment, and supplies will be equal to the flying mission or
   highest mission being supported.
   5.3. Non-Aircraft Related Emergencies. In addition to aircraft related emergencies, there are
   three basic and distinct emergency response protocols that we must follow and provide
   manpower for, when called upon for service. They are structural fire fighting response,
   vehicle/confined space rescue and hazardous materials mitigation. Each protocol requires
   that a distinct number of personnel be present to operate equipment in order to perform
   various tactical functions safely and effectively. Due to cross- staffing, this poses the
   potential for degrading ARFF manning capability (See Fire Ground Operations at
   Attachment #4). Fire Emergency Services only provides response to medical emergencies
   when manpower and vehicles are available as this is not a core function.
6. Staffing.
   6.1. Applying DoDI 6055.06 and AFI 32-2001 directives, staffing requirements to assigned
   ARFF apparatus requires the optimum of 17 - 19 operations personnel on-duty for a B-747
   aircraft incident. The combined effects of TDY's, deployments, sick leaves and other factors
   frequently lower the number of available fire fighters. Based on fire fighter availability,
   efforts are utilized to maintain staffing levels at the Optimum Level of Service. (See Table 5)
   Staffing within this range meets DoDI 6055.06 directives and is preferred. Decreases to
   staffing levels disrupt required fire protection support functions (Training, Fire Prevention,
   etc.), and may cause additional overtime payments or the canceling leave/days off.

NOTE: * 61 funded authorizations per Unit Manning Document. 64 total authorizations (3
unfunded due to 44EF00/Set 5 revisions).
     6.2. This plan addresses manning at four levels: Top-End RLS, RLS, CLS and ILS.
     Reduced manning levels provide less a than adequate work force to fully staff assigned
     firefighting equipment and the capability to meet mission support requirements (see FES
     Manning Chart at Attachment 5). Reduced manning levels place increased reliance on
     vehicle cross staffing and Mutual Aid support. The probability of fire occurrence is no
     higher while manning is at reduced levels; however, the probability of fire loss increases
     significantly as vehicle availability and manning decrease and the time to respond to a fire
     increases. Reduced manning increases the risk to life and mission assets. Critical manning
     poses an extreme risk. Insufficient staffing will have a negative impact on any fire incident.
     6.2.1. Top End Reduced Level of Service. Operations section staffed between 16 to 14
     personnel on-duty. At reduced levels of manning, interior fire attack/rescue operations will
     be delayed. Firefighter safety may be compromised due to the reduced staffing levels.
        6.2.2. Reduced Level of Service. Operations section staffed between 13 to 12 personnel
        on-duty. At RLS, interior fire attack/rescue operations will be dependent on current
        staffing qualifications. In essence this is the ability for the FES flight to have the proper
        mix of qualified firefighters as identified in section 5.1.1. An aggressive interior fire
        attack on a large/medium frame aircraft is a manpower intensive operation. The inability
        to mount an aggressive interior fire attack due to insufficient manpower presents the
        potential of losing the entire aircraft and aircrew if they are unable to perform self-rescue.
        Based on the extreme risk, the Wing Commander should consider reducing flying and
        maintenance activities and diverting in-flight emergencies after consultation with the
        IFC. Firefighter safety may be compromised due to lack of an independent Incident
        Safety Officer, which is identified as a critical core fire ground task under the current
        44EF00.
        6.2.3. Critical Level of Service. Operations section staffed at 11 personnel on-duty.
        Firefighters are expected to revert to defensive operations when the emergency cannot be
        quickly contained. This level of service represents limited rescue capability and increased
        risk/loss potential due to limited resources. Therefore, operating at CLS continuously for
        periods of more than 72 hours is prohibited without a written RM plan signed by the
        installation or wing commander. Due to exhaustion and resource limitations, CLS is
        considered a “one shot” capability that cannot be sustained for more than approximately
        15 minutes. Based on the extreme risk, the Wing Commander may consider reducing
        flying and maintenance activities and diverting in-flight emergencies after consultation
        with the IFC. Firefighter safety may be compromised due to lack of an independent
        Incident Safety Officer, which is identified as a critical core fire ground task under the
        current 44EF00.
        6.2.4. Inadequate Level of Service. Operations section staffed at 10 personnel or less on-
        duty. Manning at this level, even with maximum cross staffing this level does not meet
        minimum DoDI 6055.06 directives. It requires parking fire vehicles to maintain manning
        on others. It does not provide an adequate work force to perform simultaneous exterior
        and interior aircraft fire fighting, rescue and agent/water re-supply operations. An
        aggressive interior fire attack on a medium/large frame aircraft is a manpower intensive
MCCONNELLAFBI 32-2005 8 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                            9


      operation. The inability to mount an aggressive interior fire attack due to insufficient
      manpower presents the potential of losing the entire aircraft and aircrew if they are
      unable to perform self-rescue. Based on the extreme risk, the Wing Commander should
      consider reducing flying and maintenance activities and diverting in-flight emergencies
      after consultation with the IFC. Firefighter safety may be compromised due to lack of an
      independent Incident Safety Officer, which is identified as a critical core fire ground task
      under the current 44EF00.
7. Interim Staffing Measures.
   7.1. During contingency operations, civilian furlough actions or any other event that reduces
   fire protection manning below the Optimum Level of Service, the following actions will be
   accomplished at the IFC or designated representatives’ discretion:
      7.1.1. Use overtime for civilian employees. (if applicable)
      7.1.2. Assign military fire protection support (8 hours) personnel to operations section.
      7.1.3. Curtail military days off.
      7.1.4. Reduce the number of personnel in the McConnell Emergency Communications
      Center.
      7.1.5. Postpone leaves.
      7.1.6. Reschedule schools and other TDY’s.
      7.1.7. Request manning assistance through HQ AMC/A7X.
   7.2. The FES support functions impacted are critical to the long-term health of the fire
   prevention and training programs. Additionally, the actions outlined can hurt the morale and
   quality of life of fire fighters, indirectly degrading the fire protection mission. Long-term use
   of these interim measures should be avoided if at all possible.
   7.3. Daily fire protection flight on-duty manning below the Optimum Level of Service
   should be seen by the McConnell AFB leadership as a critical impact to mission performance
   and an increased risk to life safety of all 22d ARW, 184th IW, and the 931st Group members.
      7.3.1. During high risk periods should manning fall below the OLS and above the CLS
      as defined in paragraph 6.2, the Assistant Chief for Operations will prepare an
      Operational Risk Management worksheet to be approved and signed by the IFC.
      7.3.2. CLS capability must be maintained at all times. Whenever CLS capability cannot
      be continuously provided, resources shall be allocated to provide increased capability.
      Deviating below CLS requires the IFC to prepare an ORM.
          7.3.2.1. Short-Term Deviations. Short-term deviations are caused by immediate
          unavoidable circumstances that reduce capability below the RLS or situations that
          cause a deviation from the requirements of DoDI 6055.06 or other FES policy for less
          than 90 days continuously. Short-term deviations are normally resolved at the IFC
          level.
          7.3.2.1.1. Reductions in levels of service are reported when the Adjusted Manpower
          for Operations (AMO) or available agent is or will be reduced below 75 percent, the
          IFC notifies the Base Fire Marshal (BFM).
 10                                       MCCONNELLAFBI 32-2005 8 SEPTEMBER 2014


              7.3.2.1.2. When the AMO or available agent is reduced below 50 percent, the
              Fire Marshal or Fire Chief make appropriate notifications to inform the Wing
              Commander and MAJCOM FES Staff.
              7.3.2.1.3. When the CLS is not or will not be available for any period of time
              within a FDZ, the BFM or IFC makes appropriate notifications to inform the
              Wing Commander and MAJCOM FES Staff.
   7.4. During holiday periods when it has been published that the airfield will be closed, no
   aircraft maintenance is being performed and with IFC's concurrence, manning may be
   reduced below the OLS personnel on-duty based on sound operational risk management
   principles.
8. Notification.
   8.1. The McConnell Emergency Communications Center (MECC) operator will take

Terms
Adjusted Manpower for Operations (AMO)—The total number of operations personnel
needed to accomplish all fire ground tasks without multi-tasking. AMO is determined by
dividing the total authorizations for operations by the manpower availability factor 2.64. The
result is the number of personnel expected for duty when all authorized personnel are available.
The AMO is based on typical structural and aircraft firefighting tasks.
Aggregate Response Times (ART)—The total of dispatch time, turnout time, and travel time.
The time elapsed from the receipt of the emergency alarm to when the units arrive on scene.
Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting Rescue Vehicles—P-2, P-4, P-15, P-19, P-23, P-34.

Critical Level of Service (CLS)—The level of capability when resources available provide at
least one appropriate vehicle and crew to each FDZ within the response time standard. Although
acceptable, CLS is the absolute minimum level of service and should only be allowed for short
durations. At this level firefighting forces can provide rescue and quick fire attack operations for
a short duration. Firefighting crews may provide limited search and rescue, and property
conservation during this period; however, these operational capabilities cannot be sustained
without additional resources.
Fire Demand Zone (FDZ)—A specific area within a fire district that demands similar resources,
tactics and strategy to manage FES events.
Optimum Level of Service (OLS)—The level of service available when 90 to 100 percent of
AMO required resources (vehicles set to provide required agent, required discharge capacity; and
required manpower for fire ground capability) are available. At the OLS, a maximum level of
service can be continuously provided, when determined appropriate by the IFC. During OLS,
firefighting forces are capable of providing all services continuously throughout an event with
reasonable expectation of successful offensive fire attack operations, search and rescue, and
property conservation.
Reduced Level of Service (RLS)—The level of FES capability that exceeds the critical but is
less than the optimum level of service. During this level adequate firefighting capability can be
provided by utilizing cross staffing, selective response and sound fire ground tactics. At the RLS,
firefighting forces should be successful in offensive fire attack operations, search and rescue, and
property conservation; however, operations may not be sustainable throughout an event without
additional resources.
Senior Fire Official (SFO)—IFC; Deputy IFC; and the Assistant Chiefs of Operations,
Training, Fire Prevention or Health & Safety.

NOTES:
1. NFPA 403, Standard for Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting Services at Airport, 2009 Edition, establishes minimum of 3
ARFF vehicles required based on airport category. Firefighting capability is reduced with only 2 ARFF vehicles in-service.
The risk of injury to personnel and damage to assets increases.
2. Agent capacity will differ by 500 gallons if the P-19R is out of service.
3. Manning authorization does not provided staffing for this vehicle. 8-hour personnel would be needed to staff this vehicle
during peak high hazard hours.
4. If aircrew rescue is required, success in fire extinguishment may be delayed due to firefighting resources taking steps to
control the fire, initiate evacuation, and rescue those unable to self-evacuate.
5. With ARFF capability at RLS adequate firefighting capability can be provided and fire fighting forces can expect
successful outcomes if manning is at or above OLS. This will allow for supplemental resources to sustain a continuous fire
attack.

Aid for Structural Fire
Protection
A number of courses of action are defined as "Consider Divert/Curtail" in this chart. For example, "diverting an in-
flight emergency". The final course of action depends upon the nature of the emergency. If there is no immediate
danger to the aircraft, and there is sufficient fuel to divert to an alternate military installation or municipal airport,
that may be the proper course of action. On the other hand, an engine fire may necessitate an immediate landing. In
that case, whatever manpower and vehicles are available would be used in an attempt to perform rescue and
extinguish the fire although the risk to firefighters and aircrew would be greatly increased.
