SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been significantly changed, to include the OPR. It should be thoroughly
reviewed.
1. PROGRAM OBJECTIVE:
   1.1. To provide exceptionally qualified Airmen First Class (A1C) with a one-time
   consideration for promotion to Senior Airman, to be effective 6 months prior to the fully-
   qualified point. Selection opportunity is 15 percent.
2                                                              35FWI36-2502 11 MARCH 2010


2. AUTHORITIES:
    2.1. 35 FW/CC is the BTZ CBB authority and is responsible for administering the BTZ
    program. Commanders of large units (seven or more eligible) have selection and promotion
    authority. Small unit commanders (six or less eligible) nominate to the CBB and have
    promotion authority once selections are approved by 35 FW/CC.
    2.2. Commanders of large units will release the results of the LUB on the date authorized by
    the 35 FW/CC.
3. IDENTIFYING/VERIFYING ELIGIBLES:
    3.1. 35 FSS/FSMPD will receive a product within the first 10 days of the first processing
    month (i.e., Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct). The roster identifies all A1Cs who meet the time-in-grade
    (TIG) and time-in-service (TIS) requirements regardless of promotion eligibility conditions
    (i.e., on control roster, undergoing Article 15 punishment, EPR referral, etc.). The Career
    Development Section will verify each individual to ensure they meet TIG and TIS
    requirements for the current quarter.
    3.2. By the third week of the first processing month (see Figure 3.1), the Career
    Development Section will provide unit commanders an eligibility listing identifying all who
    meet TIG and TIS requirements for those promotion months (Attachment 1). The Career
    Development Section will also provide the convening date of the CBB (explained in
    paragraph 5).
    3.3. A cover letter (Attachment 1) will identify each squadron as a small or a large unit.
    3.4. Unit commanders must consider all eligible. This includes individuals who are on
    leave, TDY or who may have an assignment with a RNLTD on the first day of the first
    processing month or later.

            Oct-Nov                              Dec                            Jan-Mar
4. QUOTAS:
    4.1. Quotas are established at 15 percent of eligible based on TIG and TIS only. The Career
    Development Section determines quotas and obtains the MPS Chief approval before
    distribution of quotas to the units. Units may not aggregate at the group level. Example:
    Medical Group is divided into five units and each unit commander has promotion authority,
    therefore, they will be considered as individual units and cannot be added together to make a
    large unit (refer AFI 36-2502, paragraph 2.2.6.2).
35FWI36-2502 11 MARCH 2010                                                                     3


Table 2. Quota Computations and Distribution.
 Computation: Eligibles multiplied by 15 percent equals the quota
 Example: 13 eligibles x 0.15 = 1.95, or 2 BTZ Quotas. Fractions of 0.5 or more are rounded up

 Distribution:           Eligible            Quota              Eligible             Quota
                          07-09               01                 37-43                06
                          10-16               02                 44-49                07
                          17-23               03                 50-56                08
                          24-29               04                 57-63                09
                          30-36               05                 64-69                10
5.   CBB PROCEDURES:
     5.1. Small units (squadrons with less than seven eligible) can nominate any eligible A1C in
     their unit to meet the CBB. However, it is imperative that commanders nominate only
     those members that are exceptionally qualified and deserving of early promotion. The
     CBB should not be asked to consider average packages. Small units are not required to
     submit a nominee if those eligible are not exceptionally qualified.
     5.2. The CBB will be a records only board.
     5.3. The unit will ensure eligible members verify that their Record Review Listing (RRL)
     data is accurate and complete. Individuals are responsible for correcting any erroneous data
     prior to the CBB convening.
     5.4. Nomination Format: Units will provide a maximum of 15 lines (not including
     headings), singled-spaced, on the most current version of the AF Form 1206, Nomination for
     Award . The three headings are:
        5.4.1. LEADERSHIP AND JOB PERFORMANCE IN PRIMARY DUTY
        5.4.2. SIGNIFICANT SELF-IMPROVEMENT
        5.4.3. BASE AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
            5.4.3.1. The AF Form 1206 and the unit listing must be certified (digital or ink
            signature accepted) and emailed to the 35 FSS/Career Development organizational E-
            mail account along with a copy of the physical fitness history no later than the 25th
            day of the 2nd processing month.
     5.5. CBB Composition: The typical CBB will have a board president and four - six board
     members. The CBB will consist of the Command Chief Master Sergeant (CCM) or a CCM-
     designate and one CMSgt from each of the following groups: 35 OG, 35 MSG, 35 MXG, 35
     MDG, 373 ISRG and 35 FWSA. If there is not a CMSgt available for a specific group, a
     SMSgt may act in their stead. MSgts may not act as board members. The CCM or CCM-
     designate will act as the board president. There must be a board president and at least four
     group representatives for a selection board to be valid.
     5.6. Selection folder: The Career Development Section will build an electronic selection
     folder for each eligible member nominated by their unit commander and will then forward to
     the 35 FW/CCC NLT one week prior to the CBB. The nominee’s selection folder will
4                                                                 35FWI36-2502 11 MARCH 2010


      consist of the BTZ RIP, single-page AMS SURF, AF Form 1206, a complete fitness history
      from the Air Force Fitness Management System and decoration citations (if applicable).
      EPRs/LOEs will not be considered.
      5.7. Scoring: Board members will score each nominee’s selection folder using the 6.0 to 10
      point scale. Use of tenths is highly encouraged (ex: 7.3, 7.4, 7.5). Selection folders will be
      reviewed using “whole-person concept” criteria. Board members must distinguish between
      nominees – no two nominees should receive the same score from a board member.

Figure 1. Scoring Guide.

    Scoring Guide:
    10 – Absolutely tops
    9.5 – Outstanding record
    9.0 – Very strong record
    8.5 – Strong record
    8.0 – Slightly higher than average
    7.5 – Average
    7.0 – Slightly below average
    6.5 – Well below average
    6.0 – Not competitive

      5.8. Rank Order: Based on computed scores, board members will rank order the nominees.
      The member with highest score is ranked #1.
      5.9. The board president will collect the score sheets and add the rank order numbers for
      each nominee. The nominees with the lowest totals (highest overall rank order) are
      recommended for promotion.
      5.10. In the event of a tie, the board president will direct a reevaluation of the tying packages
      only. If the matter cannot be resolved, the board president will break the tie.
      5.11. The board president will provide a promotion recommendation letter for the 35 FW
      Commander’s approval (Attachment 2). The letter will rank order the nominees based upon
      the allotted quota and will include two alternates.
6. LUB PROCEDURES:
      6.1. Large units are squadrons with seven or more eligible. Large units may select 15
      percent of their eligible for promotion (See Figure 4.1). If eligible members are not
      exceptionally qualified for early promotion, unit commanders may elect not to use their full
      quota.
      6.2. The LUB will not be held earlier than the 1st week of the selection month and not later
      than the 3rd week of the selection month. This requirement is imposed to ensure fair,
      equitable, and timely promotion consideration throughout Misawa AB.
      6.3. The LUB may be a records-only or physical (if all personnel are available) board.
35FWI36-2502 11 MARCH 2010                                                                     5


   6.4. Commanders must review the Airman's Unit Personnel Record Group in the Personal
   Records Display Application, and the Personal Information File (if maintained) to discuss the
   consideration with the supervisor, before making a BTZ decision.
   6.5. Nomination Format: Supervisors will provide a maximum of 15 lines (not including
   headings), singled-spaced, on the most current version of the AF Form 1206, Nomination for
   Award. The three headings are:
      6.5.1. LEADERSHIP AND JOB PERFORMANCE IN PRIMARY DUTY
      6.5.2. SIGNIFICANT SELF-IMPROVEMENT
      6.5.3. BASE AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
   6.6. LUB Composition: The LUB will have a board president and three - four board
   members. The LUB will consist of the squadron CEM or CEM-designate, who will act as
   board president. All other CMSgts in the unit should be given the opportunity to participate
   in the LUB. The board president may also identify SMSgts, and if necessary, stellar MSgts,
   from the unit as board members to ensure that a wide cross-section of the unit is represented.
   MSgts will only be utilized as board members if CMSgts or SMSgts are not available.
   6.7. Selection folder: The unit will build a selection folder for each member nominated.
   The nominee’s selection folder will consist of the BTZ RIP, single-page AMS SURF, AF
   Form 1206, a complete fitness history from the Air Force Fitness Management System and
   decoration citations (if applicable). EPRs/LOEs will not be considered.
   6.8. Scoring, rank ordering and final promotion recommendations will be conducted in the
   same manner as the CBB. See paragraphs 5.7 – 5.11.
   6.9. Upon identifying the unit selectees, the commander must provide a written promotion
   recommendation letter (Attachment 3) and signed (digital or ink signature) unit roster to the
   35 FSS/Career Development E-mail account by the suspense date of the BTZ cover letter
   (Attachment 1).
7. ANNOUNCING SELECTIONS:
   7.1. The 35 FW/CC approves selections or lines through the non-selectees and the Career
   Development Section will announce the results to the respective unit commanders. Results
   of both the CBB and LUB will not be made public until after the 35 FW/CC has approved the
   selections.

MEMORANDUM FOR _____________________

FROM: 35 FSS/ FSMPD

SUBJECT: Senior Airman (SrA) Below-the-Zone (BTZ) Unit Eligible List

1. The attached list identifies A1Cs assigned to your unit who may be considered for BTZ
promotion to SrA this quarter. They have a date of rank (DOR) within 6 months of the normal
fully qualified DOR for promotion to SrA. The instructions apply, as indicated:

   ___ a. Your unit has six or less eligible and may nominate one of the eligible A1Cs to
compete before the Central Base Board (CBB) to be held on __________________. Refer to
the 35th Fighter Wing Instruction 36-2502. Please underline the name of your nominee(s) who
will meet the board, sign the list and return the original along with your nomination package to
35 FSS/ FSMPD NLT ___________________. Forward only those nominees that are
exceptionally qualified and deserving of below-the-zone promotion.

   ___ b. Your unit has seven or more eligible and may select ____ A1Cs for SrA BTZ
promotion through your Large Unit Board (LUB) process. LUBs are to convene not earlier than
_____________ but not later than ________________. Please return the signed unit listing,
along with your unit’s promotion recommendation to 35 FSS/ FSMPD NLT
____________________ to ensure timely update of personnel and pay data. Do not publicly
release promotion selections until the 35 FW/CC has approved the selections.

2. The SrA BTZ Unit Eligibility Listing is in three parts. Part I identifies promotion eligible
A1Cs. Part II lists “questionable promotion eligibles” (individuals with quality indicators) who
may not be qualified for BTZ promotion. Part III lists A1Cs who meet the TIG and TIS
requirements, but who cannot be selected due to promotion ineligibility conditions listed in AFI
36-2502, Table 1.1.

3. Carefully review quality indicators (i.e., letters of counseling, letters of reprimand, low EPR
ratings, UIFs, sub-standard fitness, etc.) before making your selections. If the quality is not there,
you are not required to use your full quota or even nominate/select any or all of your eligibles. If
no eligibles are selected, clearly state so, sign and return the roster.
35FWI36-2502 11 MARCH 2010                                                                            7


4. Airmen must have a 3-skill level to be promoted to SrA. Process PAFSC skill level waivers
for A1Cs with a 1-skill level according to AFI 36-2502, Table 2.1. On the BTZ roster, if the
airman has a 3-skill level, disregard the note “PAFSC skill level too low.” However, if the
airman does not have a 3-skill level, determine eligibility for a PAFSC skill level waiver and
process accordingly. Skill level requirements must be met by the effective date of promotion to
SrA.

5. For a member who is projected or may have already departed your unit, you may still be
required to consider them for BTZ promotion. If the report not later than date (RNLTD) is the
first day of the first processing month (January, April, July, or October) or later, then they must
be considered by the losing unit. Please contact us for instructions on these procedures.

6. If you have any questions, please call the Career Development Section at 226-3877.
