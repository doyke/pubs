5.5.2.3. (Added) SMs will be notified of all visits to their respective units involving access to classified
information. JPAS will be used as the primary source for confirming access eligibility for Department
of Defense (DoD) and DoD contractor personnel visiting to Spangdahlem AB. As common practice,
JPAS visit requests will be sent in advance of a proposed visit. SMs will convey this requirement to
requestors to ensure this requirement is met. In cases where JPAS cannot be used to confirm access
eligibility, Visit Authorization letters (VAL) will be used. The visited host or sponsoring activity
remains responsible for confirming a visitor’s “need-to-know.” All visits by foreign nationals involving
classified or controlled unclassified information are subject to foreign disclosure requirements. Upon
arrival, SMs will provide a list of any visitors accessing classified to 52 SFS/S5I immediately.
5.8.1.1.3. (Added) Commanders will designate, in writing, at least one Primary and one Alternate Top
Secret Control Officer (TSCO) and forward a copy of the appointment letter to 52 SFS/S5I. Upon

Order (AFTO) 00-20F-02 and all chapters of governing directives and regulations for storage and
safekeeping of classified material, copies of all forms required for the management for a safe, secure
room or vault and any informational letters or changes in security guidance provided by the SM or 52
SFS/S5I. This list is not all-inclusive. SMs will provide additional guidance for any additional items
required.
5.12.3. (Added) The 52d Fighter Wing Command Post is designated as the overnight repository for
classified material. The 726th Air Mobility Squadron Freight Terminal has an area approved for open
storage and will be used for temporary storage of bulk transient classified material.

maintenance of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) will be accomplished only by U.S. citizens who
have been subjected to a trustworthiness determination IAW DoD 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security
Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management.
5.18.4.All 52 FW organizations and tenant organizations will provide 52 SFS/S5I a current listing of
classified storage containers, secure rooms and or vaults by 31 January each year. Listings will be
updated as changes occur. List will include building location, room number, level of classified cleared
for, type of approved room (e.g. vault, secure room), type of lock, list of custodians, if the room is
alarmed and date the room was certified, as a minimum.
5.21.2.3. (Added) In block 11 of the Standard Form 700, Security Container Information, the first and
second line will reflect the commander’s appointed Primary and Alternate safe custodians.
5.21.3.3. (Added) SF 700 Part II will be used within the 52 FW and supported units. SM and safe
custodians will ensure classification and special handling markings are affixed to the outside of the SF
700 Part II envelope (e.g. “Requires Restricted Data Access”). SM and custodians will secure the SF
700 Part II in a safe, either within the unit or another base organization. Everyone with access to the
container storing the SF 700s will be indoctrinated to the classification level indicated on the forms. If
this cannot be accomplished, implement additional administrative controls within the organization to
properly store the SF 700 Part II - contact SM or 52 SFS/S5I for guidance. Additional administrative
controls will have to be coordinated through 52 SFS/S5I prior to implementation.
5.21.3.3.1. (Added) Commanders may request a waiver from using the SF 700 Part II for material that
has additional accountability measures already in place (e.g. Top Secret Control Accounts, Two Person
Control Material, etc). Initial requests for a waiver will be sent via the SIPRNet to 52 SFS/S5I by the
Officer in Charge or Superintendent. Upon approval, the Commander will sign an MFR accepting the
risk and the MFR is to be kept in the section requesting the waiver and a copy filed with the SM in their
continuity book.
5.21.3.4. (Added) If the safe stores NATO classified material or reference AFI 31-406, Applying North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Protection Standards Para 5.3. for control procedures or, if the
safe stores Top Secret material reference AFI 31-401 USAFE Sup Para 5.8.1.3.1.. Safes that contain
“only” COMSEC material will receive guidance from the 52 FW COMSEC Office on the use of SF 700
Part 2.

6.3.2.6. (Added) Only individuals with a current U.S. security clearances and a signed NdA (verified in
JPAS) are authorized to receipt for U.S. Registered Mail. All registered mail must be protected as
“classified” information until opened. SMs will verify the security clearance, NdA and access levels for
personnel designated by the commander to receipt for U.S. Registered Mail.
8.3.7. (Added) Classified custodians are responsible for ensuring all personnel sending, receiving,
handling or storing classified material under their control are knowledgeable of original classification,
derivative classification, declassifying and downgrading information, marking, safeguarding,
transmitting or transporting, and actual or potential compromise of classified information IAW
Executive Orders, DoD and Air Force Information Security Program guidelines.
8.10.1.7. (Added) Prior to granted access to Restricted Data (RD) or Formerly Restricted Data (FRD),
personnel who require access to RD and or FRD will receive a training briefing. RD and FRD training
briefing is in the form of a PowerPoint presentation, which is located on the 52 FW Information
Protection Program community of practice site (CoPs).                     The CoPs website is
