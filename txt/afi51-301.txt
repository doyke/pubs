Discovery/Litigation Hold Process Instructions

The below changes to AFI 51-301, dated 1 July 2002, are effective immediately.

(New) Chapter 10

DISCOVERY/LITIGATION HOLD PROCESS

Section 10A—Purpose, Background, and Applicability

10.1 Purpose. This Chapter assigns responsibilities to functional area experts and others to
ensure the Air Force meets its obligations to search for, identify, preserve, and collect
documents, tangible things, and electronically stored information (ESI) during litigation or in
matters that it reasonably expects to litigate. Additional guidance and procedures for
implementation can be found in the attachments to AFGM2013-51-03. All Air Force personnel
involved in the discovery/litigation hold process should be familiar with these guidance
documents.

10.2 Background. The Air Force has a duty, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
(FRCP) and case law, to search for and preserve potentially relevant information during
litigation. These duties arise not only when litigation is filed, but exist as soon as litigation is
reasonably anticipated. FRCP Amendments make clear discovery obligations apply to all forms
of information, including ESI.

10.3 Applicability. These responsibilities and resulting procedures apply to individuals, units,
and organizations at all levels of the Air Force, including Active Duty personnel, civilian
employees, contractors who provide records or information technology management services to
Air Force assets, Air National Guard (ANG) members while in Federal service, and Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC) members in Title 10 status (collectively Air Force personnel.)

DEFINITIONS

Air Force Records Office (AFRO)—Headed by the Air Force Records Officer, appointed by
the Air Force Chief Information Officer (CIO) to direct the Air Force Records Program and all
associated activities.

Air Force personnel—Includes individuals, units, and organizations at all levels of the United
States Air Force (Air Force), including Active Duty personnel, civilian employees, Air National
Guard (ANG) members while in Federal service, and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)
members in Title 10 status.

Data Map—A listing of information about an organization’s electronic data, which may include,
but is not limited to: the storage locations; the type, amount, and description of data that lies in
the storage locations; the name and type of operating systems, computers, servers, networks, and
databases on which the data resides; the name of individuals with access to the information; and
the data security and disposition policies in effect for the storage location.

Discovery—The process by which one party in litigation obtains information and data from
other parties. There are several formalized methods of conducting discovery that are governed
by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. They include: interrogatories, requests for production
of documents, requests for admissions, and depositions. Before formal discovery begins, parties
have an obligation to search for and preserve information that may be relevant to the issues in the
case. Discovery is not limited to only information that may be admissible in evidence, but
extends to information that is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.

Document—(1) Recorded information regardless of physical form or characteristics. Often used
interchangeably with record. (2) An individual record or an item of non-record materials or of
personal papers.

In the context of discovery in civil litigation, the term applies to writings, printed words,
drawings, graphs, charts, lithographs, photographs, images, sound recordings, maps or plans, and
any other form of printed material, stored in any medium from which information can be
obtained either directly, or if necessary, after translation by the responding party into a
reasonably usable form. See FRCP, Rule 34.

It is generally understood that the term also now includes electronically stored information, such
that a party need not differentiate between the two when making a discovery request. See FRCP,
Rule 34, Comment, 2006 Amendment, Subdivision (a).

Electronically Stored Information (ESI)—Includes any digital information, draft and final
records and non-record materials, stored in a medium from which it can be retrieved and used.

                                                  Chapter 1

                                        GENERAL PROVISIONS

1.1. Responsibilities of The Judge Advocate General (TJAG). TJAG responsibilities are as written in
this instruction and must be consistent with Secretary of the Air Force Orders 111.1, Functions and Duties
of the General Counsel, April 26, 1999, and 111.5, Delineation of Responsibilities of the General Counsel
and the Judge Advocate General, October 30, 1997. Those acting on behalf of TJAG (such as the various
civil litigation divisions in the Air Force Legal Services Agency [AFLSA] and the International and Oper-
ations Law Division [HQ USAF/JAI]) may perform the functions detailed in paragraph 1.1.3. Addition-
ally:
   1.1.1. Commands subordinate to HQ USAF and AFLSA must not initiate or take any action pertain-
   ing to these responsibilities unless TJAG specifically authorizes them.
   1.1.2. Commands and judge advocates should make every effort to identify causes of action in favor
   of the United States and promptly notify the proper division in the office of TJAG or AFLSA.
   1.1.3. The Judge Advocate General, in coordination with the Office of the Air Force General Counsel
   (SAF/GC):
       1.1.3.1. Protects the interests of the United States Air Force in legal and administrative proceed-
       ings in the United States and foreign countries.
       1.1.3.2. Maintains close liaison with the Department of Justice (DoJ) to:
           1.1.3.2.1. Obtain evidence to support the government's position.
           1.1.3.2.2. Prepare pleadings and briefs.
           1.1.3.2.3. Compile and evaluate evidence.
           1.1.3.2.4. Litigate or assist in the litigation of civil cases.
       1.1.3.3. Makes Air Force recommendations about:
           1.1.3.3.1. Initiating legal actions and appeals in domestic and foreign courts in significant Air
           Force cases. (Except for appeals involving Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals cases).
           1.1.3.3.2. Accepting proposed compromises or settlements of pending litigation or controver-
           sies in significant Air Force cases, including those in foreign countries.
       1.1.3.4. Coordinates closely with other Department of Defense (DoD) agencies, the General
       Accounting Office (GAO), and other federal agencies in procuring evidence to support the gov-
       ernment's position.
       1.1.3.5. Negotiates and presents evidence, pleadings, and briefs to federal, state, and municipal
       regulatory bodies in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings.
   1.1.4. The appropriate civil litigation division of AFLSA or HQ USAF/JAI, on behalf of TJAG, ordi-
   narily determines who may appear as an attorney or counsel for the Air Force in a civil judicial or
   administrative action (foreign or domestic). As a matter of written Air Force legal policy, as estab-
   lished by TJAG or SAF/GC, there may already be existing delegation for installation level judge
   advocates and attorneys to appear on behalf of the Air Force before certain administrative bodies. In
8                                                                               AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002


    cases where direct representation of the United States before a state, federal or foreign court is
    involved, the concurrence of DoJ may be required.
    1.1.5. No person on active duty with the Air Force, or employed in a civilian or reserve capacity by
    the Air Force, may appear or represent any individual, corporation, association, or other outside entity
    as their attorney or counsel in a civil judicial or administrative action (foreign or domestic) without the
    written permission of TJAG or TJAG’s designee.

1.2. Representing the Air Force and Air Force Officials Sued in Their Official Capacities. DoJ has
the statutory responsibility to represent the Air Force and Air Force officials who are being sued in their
official capacities (Title 28, United States Code, Sections 516-519). This responsibility extends to litiga-
tion in foreign courts. (However, see Title 10, United States Code, Section 1037 and AR 27-50/SEC-
NAVINST 5820.4G/AFJI 51-706, Status Of Forces Policies, Procedures, And Information, 15 December
1989.)
    1.2.1. Occasionally, this responsibility is delegated entirely to TJAG.
    1.2.2. When the Attorney General is served a copy of a complaint, DoJ formally requests that the
    appropriate AFLSA civil litigation division send a litigation report to the attorney defending the Air
    Force official.
    1.2.3. Installation staff judge advocates (SJAs) or other Air Force officials gather the specific infor-
    mation and documents to comply with DoJ requests, and forward such information and documents to
    the appropriate AFLSA civil litigation division or HQ USAF/JAI.

1.3. Requests by Air Force Officials for Representation by DoJ. Past or present Air Force personnel
or employees who are named as individual defendants for personal liability in civil or criminal proceed-
ings for acts or omissions arising from the performance of their official Air Force duties may request rep-
resentation by DoJ (see Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 50.15, and 50.16). NOTE:
Because personnel sued in their personal capacity may have as little as twenty (20) days to respond
to a complaint, time is of the essence in processing these requests.
    1.3.1. DoJ will not defend an individual against a federal criminal action.
    1.3.2. Under certain circumstances, Air Force contractors being sued by third parties may also request
    government representation.
    1.3.3. An individual who wants government representation:
       1.3.3.1. Writes a request (see Figure 1.1. for the request format) and sends it through the SJA or
       the official designated in paragraph 1.5.to HQ USAF/JAI or the appropriate AFLSA litigation
       division (see Chapter 2 through Chapter 7).
NOTE: Officials in the Secretariat send requests through SAF/GC.
       1.3.3.2. Submits an affidavit or declaration (see Figure 1.2.) showing that the matter arose out of
       the performance of official Air Force duties.
       1.3.3.3. Submits an affidavit or declaration (see Figure 1.3.) from the requester’s commander or
       supervisor stating that:
           1.3.3.3.1. He or she has read the complaint and the requester's affidavit or declaration.
AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002                                                                                    9


         1.3.3.3.2. The matter arose out of the performance of official Air Force duties.
  1.3.4. Air Force personnel may request, from the nearest installation SJA, the assistance of Air Force
  legal counsel in preparing their request for representation. If such counsel is provided, an attorney-cli-
  ent relationship will exist between the Air Force counsel and the requesting Air Force employee until
  a decision on the representation request is reached, or the assistance is voluntarily terminated by one
  or more of the parties involved. Communications and confidences shared between the Air Force coun-
  sel and the requesting Air Force employee for purposes of the provided legal assistance shall be priv-
  ileged. Air Force personnel who are required to have access to such privileged information for the
  purpose of processing the request are also required to maintain the privilege. Given this privilege, and
  because of the SJA’s inherent duties to administer military justice and investigate claims or potential
  claims against the Air Force, SJAs should exercise caution in the assignment of personnel to process
  these requests. Any subsequent representation of the employee by DoJ attorney or US Attorney per-
  sonnel shall also be considered to be covered by the attorney-client privilege.
  1.3.5. Requests for representation of Air Force personnel shall be forwarded to the appropriate civil
  law division (JACL, JACN, JACE, or JACT) of the Air Force Legal Services Agency, or to HQ
  USAF/JAI, if foreign criminal or civil proceedings are involved. (Note: See Chapter 2 through
  Chapter 7 for more information on the litigation subject matter coverage of these various divisions
  and offices.) Requests for representation of Air Force contractors should be forwarded to SAF/GCQ.
  Attorney-client privileged information should not be forwarded with the request unless absolutely
  necessary to the processing of the request. In such instance, SJAs should only forward privileged
  information with the written consent of the requester, and the prior approval and knowledge of the
  receiving AFLSA civil litigation division, HQ USAF/JAI, or SAF/GCQ, as applicable.
  1.3.6. Provision of representation and continuation of the representation is within the sole discretion
  of the Attorney General or appropriate designee. Representation of Air Force personnel will be based
  upon the following criteria:
     1.3.6.1. That the actions or omissions of the Air Force personnel being complained of occurred
     within the scope of employment;
     1.3.6.2. That the representation is in the interest of the United States; and
     1.3.6.3. That there is no unresolved conflict of interest between the United States and the Air
     Force personnel to be represented as to their relative legal positions.
  1.3.7. Representation of Air Force personnel by private counsel at federal expense, or with reimburse-
  ment of the private counsel fees, may be provided at the discretion of the Attorney General, and under
  the same criteria as in paragraph 1.3.6. (The amount of reimbursement is determined through fee
  schedules set by the Civil Division of DoJ. For information on current fee schedules, please contact
  the Director, Constitutional Torts Staff, Civil Division, at (202) 616-4140.) Such defense representa-
  tion may be provided under the following circumstances:
     1.3.7.1. In some rare federal criminal proceedings where it is in the interest of the United States
     and in accordance with the limitations of 28 CFR 50.16;
     1.3.7.2. In subject matter-related civil, congressional or state criminal proceedings where federal
     criminal proceedings prohibit representation by DoJ or US Attorney personnel;
10                                                                              AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002


        1.3.7.3. In cases involving the representation of multiple Air Force personnel with conflicting or
        potentially conflicting legal or factual positions that make representation by one attorney inappro-
        priate;
        1.3.7.4. In cases where the Solicitor General declines to authorize seeking further appellate
        review by the United States; or
        1.3.7.5. In cases when DoJ personnel involved become aware that continued representation of the
        Air Force personnel could involve the assertion of a position that conflicts with the interests of the
        United States.
     1.3.8. The government will not be responsible for the expenses of individuals who hire private coun-
     sel without express prior authorization except in circumstances beyond the individual's control, such
     as government dilatoriness or inaction, in which it then becomes necessary to hire private counsel in
     order to protect the individual's interests. Ordinarily, the government will not be responsible for any
     judgments made against individuals in their personal capacities.

1.4. Indemnification Requests.
     1.4.1. The Air Force usually cannot indemnify Air Force members or employees for any verdict,
     judgment, settlement, or other monetary award entered against them in their personal capacities. The
     Air Force considers a request for indemnification if:
        1.4.1.1. The conduct giving rise to the verdict, judgment, settlement, or award was within the
        member's or employee's scope of employment; and
        1.4.1.2. It is in the interest of the United States to indemnify the individual.
     1.4.2. The Air Force member or employee seeking indemnification must submit a signed, written
     request to his or her servicing SJA and include:
        1.4.2.1. Copies of all documents proving liability.
        1.4.2.2. An explanation of how the conduct that created the liability was within the requester's
        scope of employment or official duties.
        1.4.2.3. An explanation of how indemnification would be in the interest of the United States.
        1.4.2.4. A statement indicating if the requester has insurance or any other source of indemnifica-
        tion, and whether the requester has sought indemnification from such source.
        1.4.2.5. This declaration:

           "I understand that the Air Force's acceptance of this request for indemnification for processing
        in accordance with AFI 51-301 does not constitute an acceptance of any obligation by the Air
        Force to make such indemnification. Any indemnification that the Air Force might make is a per-
        missive action taken solely in the interest of the United States and not for my personal benefit."
     1.4.3. Requesters must include with the request a recommendation by the servicing SJA specifically
     addressing each requirement of paragraph 1.4.2.Send the request and recommendation through SJA
     channels with recommendations from each level to the chief of the appropriate litigation division.
     Comments from the SJA at major command (MAJCOM), field operating agency (FOA), or direct
     reporting unit (DRU) are particularly important.
AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002                                                                                  11


   1.4.4. Before forwarding a recommendation in favor of indemnification to the appropriate AFLSA
   civil litigation division or HQ USAF/JAI, the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU SJA coordinates the recom-
   mendation with that level FM.
      1.4.4.1. The chief of the responsible litigation division sends the request and recommendations,
      through channels, to the appropriate Secretarial designee for a decision.
      1.4.4.2. If there is insufficient time to submit an indemnification request through normal channels,
      submit the request directly to the Chief, General Litigation Division, who coordinates with the
      appropriate SJAs.
   1.4.5. The requester must include all documents or information necessary to process the indemnifica-
   tion request.
   1.4.6. The MAJCOM/FOA/DRU pays indemnification from their funds unless SAF/FM decides to
   use other funds.
   1.4.7. Indemnity decisions by the Secretarial designee are final and not subject to appeal of any kind.

of a litigation report.
     1.8.1. If a formal litigation report is required:

         tion report to the relevant MAJCOM. (See Chapter 2 for information on FTCA cases). This report

         ther, the case file records to be forwarded with the litigation report may be from a Privacy Act sys-
         tem of records or contain Privacy Act information. If so, the litigation report, the records, or both
         may need to be protected as Privacy Act records and should be appropriately marked with a footer

     evant records.

Request for Government Representation


I hereby request the Attorney General of the United States to designate counsel to defend on my behalf the
case of [CASE NAME, COURT, CASE NUMBER].


I recognize I may be required to pay any judgment against me. I further recognize that, absent an official
finding that payment is in the interest of the United States, there is no statutory authority to pay any judg-
ment against me out of the Treasury of the United States absent special legislation to that effect and that
representation will be governed by the Attorney General's Guidelines set forth in 28 CFR.15-50.16.

                                Declaration of _____________________


I, ________________________, am, and at all times relevant to this case have been, a (civil service
employee) (nonappropriated fund employee) (active duty military member) (a member of the Air
National Guard) (a member of the Air Force Reserve) of the United States Air Force. I am presently
assigned to __________ Air Force Base, _____________ , as a ______________________. (As a federal
employee, one of my responsibilities is to insure the protection of Air Force property by reporting sus-
pected abuse of such property to the proper authorities, and to report conflicts of interest within the
Defense Department). (See Exhibit _ attached, a copy of my job description). (See Exhibit _, a description
of my Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)).


(On _______________, I made a signed sworn statement to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations
(OSI) describing what I had observed and learned. I made this statement because it was my duty as a fed-
eral employee and as a member of the Air Force to report the incidents. The OSI investigated the matter.)


(From __________ to ___________, I was performing temporary duty in the Washington, D.C. area. As
part of my travel orders to perform this duty, I was authorized the rental of a vehicle. (See Exhibit
attached, a copy of my official travel orders). I rented a (year, make and model of vehicle) from (name and
location of rental agency). (See Exhibit __, a copy of the rental contract). On ___________, while pro-
ceeding from my hotel to a restaurant for dinner, I was involved in a traffic accident at (location) with a
person identified to me as ____________________.)

All of my actions in this matter were within the scope of my official Air Force duties and under color of
my office as ____________________. I acted in the good faith belief that my actions were reasonable and
in accordance with the law. (My report was based on the honest belief that these offenses had occurred
and only to ensure Air Force property was properly safeguarded and rules and regulations were complied
with.)




I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Signed this _______ day of
_____________, 20___, at ___________, ________________.

                           FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT LITIGATION

2.1. Litigation Responsibility.
   2.1.1. DoJ, through the local US Attorney or the Civil Division at DoJ, handles tort litigation involv-
   ing the US as a plaintiff or a defendant.
   2.1.2. The Tort Claims and Litigation Division (AFLSA/JACT) assists DoJ with Air Force cases
   involving the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). The Environmental Law and Litigation Division
   (AFLSA/JACE) assists DoJ with environmental cases involving the FTCA. AFLSA/JACT or /JACE
   normally retains litigation responsibility for all FTCA cases. However, AFLSA/JACT or /JACE may
   delegate litigation responsibility of a particular case to a installation while retaining overall control of
   litigation assistance. Delegations will be in writing from the chief of the division.

2.2. Handling Complaints Received at Installation Level.
   2.2.1. When you receive a complaint under the FTCA, immediately telephone AFLSA/JACT or /
   JACE with: the names of all parties to the litigation; the court involved; the case's docket number; the
   amount of damages requested; the nature of the litigation; and complete information regarding service
   of process, pleading suspense dates, and any information about other government agencies involved.
   2.2.2. Send the complaint to AFLSA/JACT or /JACE as soon as possible, by datafax and first class
   mail.
   2.2.3. If AFLSA/JACT or /JACE delegates the litigation support in a particular case to the installa-
   tion, prepare the litigation report (see paragraph 1.8.), then send it along with the complete original
   administrative claim file to the local defending US Attorney, and if requested by DoJ, send a copy of
   the litigation report to the Torts Branch, Civil Division, DoJ.
       2.2.3.1. Send litigation reports to the US Attorney or DoJ no later than 14 days before the answer
       is due.
       2.2.3.2. At the same time, send a copy of the complete claim file, pleadings, correspondence, and
       the litigation report to AFLSA/JACT or /JACE.

2.3. Handling Discovery Requests at Installation Level. In all cases, except when litigation support is
delegated to the installation on a particular case, AFLSA/JACT or /JACE will respond to all discovery
requests (interrogatories, document production, admissions) on behalf of the Air Force. However, the
installation may be tasked to assist in responding to the discovery request. When tasked to assist during
discovery, promptly respond in accordance with the specific guidance received from AFLSA/JACT or /
JACE.

2.4. Handling Personal Negligence Complaints Against Air Force Employees at Installation Level
-- Substitution.
   2.4.1. When a Complaint alleges common law negligence against an Air Force employee being sued
   in the employee’s personal capacity, substitution of the United States for the employee may be appro-
   priate under the FTCA.
24                                                                         AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002


     2.4.1.1. Where substitution may be the appropriate remedy, the employee makes a request for rep-
     resentation under paragraph 1.3.Claims personnel investigate incidents within their geographic
     area of responsibility to ascertain the facts and circumstances. SJAs forward requests for represen-
     tation to AFLSA/JACT or /JACE with a recommendation as to whether or not the United States
     should be substituted for the employee. The SJA’s forwarding documents must include the appli-
     cable state law on scope of employment, and an analysis of whether the employee was acting in
     the scope of employment at the time of the incident giving rise to the lawsuit.
     2.4.1.2. The Air Force (i.e., AFLSAJACT or /JACE) forwards a recommendation to DoJ or the
     US Attorney whether or not substitution is appropriate.
     2.4.1.3. The decision to seek substitution of the United States for the employee resides with DoJ
     or the local US Attorney. Whether or not DoJ or the local US Attorney seeks substitution is based
     strictly upon whether or not the employee was acting in the scope of employment at the time of the
     incident. Scope of employment is determined by the applicable state law.

           3.2.1.3.3. See paragraph 1.8.for the reporting format for these administrative proceedings and
           actions.

Section 3B—Civilian Personnel Litigation

3.3. General Information. The US Court of Federal Claims or federal district courts hear cases brought
by present or former civilian employees. These courts may permit trial de novo in Equal Employment
Opportunity (EEO) cases. Most other civilian personnel cases involve appeals based wholly or in part on
administrative records. (See Figure 3.1. for checklist items for the preparation of an administrative
record.)
   3.3.1. Civilian employees may appeal adverse decisions by the MSPB, and arbitrator decisions where
   the grievance involved a personnel action appealable to the MSPB, to the Court of Appeals for the
   Federal Circuit.
   3.3.2. The types of administrative records and litigation support at the beginning of litigation may
   vary widely. The litigation support requirements in paragraphs 3.3.3.through 3.3.5. are the minimum
   for each type of case. AFLSA/JACL may require additional support in certain cases.
   3.3.3. EEO Cases. Although employees may usually get a trial de novo, administrative records fre-
   quently play a central role in these cases. Accordingly, SJAs should promptly obtain these records,
   including a transcript of the administrative hearing, from the custodian and submit five copies with a
   litigation report per paragraph 1.8.
   3.3.4. MSPB Appeals. These appeals are based solely upon facts developed during MSPB adminis-
   trative hearings or arbitrations.
       3.3.4.1. The MSPB provides official copies of the record only to DoJ, not the agency involved.
       3.3.4.2. AFLSA/JACL usually encounters a lengthy delay before receiving a copy of this record.
           3.3.4.2.1. In these cases, SJAs must provide a detailed procedural history of the case and a
           description of issues raised in the administrative hearings instead of the formal litigation
           report.
28                                                                            AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002


            3.3.4.2.2. Refer to and attach copies of relevant documents, including a transcript of the
            administrative hearing.
     3.3.5. Other Civilian Personnel Court Litigation. SJAs provide formal litigation reports with five cop-
     ies of the administrative records according to paragraph 1.8., unless AFLSA/JACL directs otherwise.

3.4. Administrative Cases. See Section 3Cfor litigation support requirements and responsibilities for
cases pending before the Merit Systems Protection Board, Federal Labor Relations Authority, or Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.

Section 3C—Administrative Actions Involving Civilian Personnel Or Labor Matters

3.5. Responsibilities and Reporting Requirements.
     3.5.1. Except as provided in paragraph 3.5.2., the Central Labor Law Office (CLLO) is responsible
     for all class complaints of discrimination, both informal and formal, and for all litigation before the
     Federal Labor Relations Authority.
     3.5.2. AFMC/JA is delegated responsibility for administrative litigation involving the Air Force
     Materiel Command before the Federal Labor Relations Authority. The Staff Judge Advocate, HQ
     AFMC, may delegate this authority to installation staff judge advocates within AFMC.
     3.5.3. What to Report. You must report:
        3.5.3.1. Unfair labor practice charges and complaints.
        3.5.3.2. All representation petitions (filed by management or an union under 5 U.S.C., 7111,
        7112, 7113, 7115, or 7117) whether or not the Federal Labor Relations Authority orders a hearing
        in the case.
        3.5.3.3. Discrimination (EEO) class action complaints, both informal and formal, report them to
        the Central Labor Law Office (CLLO). See the Air Force Equal Employment Opportunity instruc-
        tions and guidance for reporting requirements.

          discovery.)
      3.6.3.4. Send the names of installation personnel (judge advocates and civilian personnel officers)
      who are the local points of contact.
      3.6.3.5. Points of contact personnel continue to advise the CLLO or NGB/JA (immediately by
      telephone with follow-up by mail) as further information becomes available.
   3.6.4. Do not contact or interview bargaining unit employees without prior express approval of the
   CLLO or NGB/JA attorney for the case.

3.7. Requesting Representation and Assistance.
   3.7.1. The CLLO’s primary mission is to represent the interests of the Air Force in litigation before
   the Federal Labor Relations Authority. Resources permitting, CLLO representation is available for
   EEO, MSPB, or arbitration matters. An initial request for representation may be made by telephone.
   Oral requests for assistance must be followed up with a written request for representation within one
   workday. The written request for representation should include the reason for requesting assistance
   and a fund citation which the CLLO can use to cover its costs associated with the representation. Send
   the litigation report (prepared according to paragraph 1.8.) as soon as possible. (See paragraph 3.6.3.)

     3.9.1. You must notify AFLSA/JACL by telephone as soon as possible during normal duty hours
     (0730-1700 hours Eastern Standard Time) on the same or next duty day about all court applications
     for a TRO, preliminary injunction, or writ of habeas corpus.
     3.9.2. You must notify AFLSA/JACL by telephone as soon as possible during normal duty hours on

     possible. You must assemble all pertinent documents as quickly as possible or as directed by the
     responsible attorney in AFLSA/JACL. (See paragraph 1.8.2.)
     3.9.4. For cases involving injunctive relief or habeas corpus, AFLSA/JACL sometimes permits direct
     contact between the office of the SJA and the US Attorney's Office. SJAs must nonetheless remember
     that litigation decisions and advice to the US Attorney's Office must come from AFLSA/JACL. The
     SJA must never agree to any form of injunctive relief or other legal restraints against the United States

AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002                                                                                       31


Section 3E—Utilities Litigation

3.10. Utility Litigation.

   their immediate dollar value.
   3.10.4. To report electric, gas, water, and sewage disposal rate cases, telephone or mail the report to
   AFLSA/JACL (ULT). Use the telephone to avoid delay in getting the information to AFLSA/JACL
   (ULT). Use the format in paragraph 1.8.For follow-on reporting (under AFI 32-1061, Providing Util-
   ities To US Air Force Installations) of electric, gas, water, and sewage disposal rate cases, send infor-
   mation copies to MAJCOM SJA offices and the installation civil engineer. Installation and MAJCOM

   the center of expertise for all utility matters, including utility rate interventions, utility privatization,
   and energy conservation. Judge advocates should contact the Utility Litigation Team in any action
   that may impact utility service to the installation.

Section 3F—Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act (PA) Litigation

3.11. General Information. In FOIA litigation, the Government has 30 days to answer a complaint, not
the normal 60-day period allowed for other litigation. (Note: Those unfamiliar with FOIA litigation
often incorrectly indicate the 60-day period on the summons.) Prompt reporting of both PA and FOIA
issues is imperative since a single complaint may include both.

3.12. Reporting Requirements. You must notify AFLSA/JACL by telephone on the duty day that you
receive a complaint. Immediately send the summons, complaint, and other available materials to AFLSA/
JACL by fax, express mail, or similar means pending the complete litigation report. Contact the appropri-
ate US Attorney’s office to verify the effective date of service and identify the Assistant US Attorney han-
dling the case.
   3.12.1. After making initial contact with AFLSA/JACL, send a formal litigation report that includes:
       3.12.1.1. A redacted and an unredacted copy of the records at issue in the litigation.

32                                                                              AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002


        3.12.1.3. The name, address, commercial, and DSN phone numbers of the responsible FOIA/PA
        officer.
     3.12.2. For Privacy Act lawsuits, the litigation report must include a statement indicating if the plain-
     tiff filed a request for amendment to the record. If such a request was filed, include a copy of the
     request and the agency's response.
     3.12.3. If the record includes photographs, send photographic prints rather than photocopies. Index
     and separately certify the redacted and unredacted records.
     3.12.4. The record custodian should use AF Form 44, Certificate of Records.

Section 3G—Tax Litigation

3.13. Tax Disputes.
     3.13.1. Whether in litigation or not, report all disputes about:
        3.13.1.1. The validity or refund of taxes against property belonging to the Air Force or its instru-
        mentalities.
        3.13.1.2. The validity or refund of taxes against property belonging to contractors who use the
        property to perform their work for the Air Force or its instrumentalities.
        3.13.1.3. Taxes imposed on Air Force personnel that raise issues under Section 574, Soldiers’ and
        Sailors’ Civil Relief Act (Title 50 Appendix, United States Code, Section 574).
     3.13.2. Report tax disputes through command channels by letter or telephone to AFLSA/JACL. In
     cases involving Government contractors, report disputes to SAF/GCQ. Use the format in paragraph
     1.8.
     3.13.3. Do not negotiate the Air Force's position on any tax dispute with officials of a political entity
     or state without prior authorization by AFLSA/JACL, or, in cases involving Government contractors,
     do not negotiate without prior authorization from SAF/GCQ.

Section 3H—Right To Financial Privacy Act Litigation

3.14. General Information. From time to time, the Air Force needs to seek information, for a legitimate
law enforcement purpose, contained in the records of a bank or other financial institution regarding an Air
Force employee or military member. When this happens, the Air Force and its subordinate organizations
are required to comply with the requirements of the Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA), Title 12,
United States Code, Sections 3401-3422. The RFPA gives individual customers of financial institutions
certain rights to notice, to object to release, or to sue federal agencies for violations of the RFPA. Ques-
tions about how to comply with the requirements of the RFPA should be directed, via the organizational
SJA, to the IL Branch.

3.15. Reporting Requirements. Whenever the Air Force or subordinate organization is named in or a
party to litigation under the RFPA, the IL Branch should be notified by telephone as soon as possible,
preferably on the duty day you receive notice of such action. Also, you will need to provide AFLSA/
JACL, by fax, express mail, or similar means, pending a complete litigation report:
AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002                                                                                    33


   3.15.1. Copies of the summons, complaint, motion to quash, or other documentation filed with the
   court in the pending litigation;
   3.15.2. A copy of the customer authorization, subpoena, judicial order, formal written request, or
   other paperwork used by the Air Force to request the financial information or records in question;
   3.15.3. A copy of all notices provided to the Air Force member or employee whose records were
   sought;
   3.15.4. A copy of any motion to quash, application to enjoin, completed motion form, or other written
   customer objections filed in an attempt to prevent release of the financial information;
   3.15.5. A copy, if any, of all judicial orders or decisions already issued regarding release of the finan-
   cial information in question; and
   3.15.6. A copy of any released financial information that is the subject of the litigation.

Section 3I—Constitutional Torts and Personal Tort Suits Not Brought Under the Federal Tort Claims
Act

3.16. Reporting Requirements. Whenever litigation names individual defendants who were acting
within the scope of their employment, you must act quickly to process representation requests (see para-
graph 1.3.) and, when necessary, to effect removal to federal court.
   3.16.1. Notify AFLSA/JACL by telephone on the duty day that you receive notice of such action:
       3.16.1.1. Send the summons, complaint, and other available materials to AFLSA/JACL by fax,
       express mail, or similar means, pending the complete litigation report.
       3.16.1.2. Send all material received by each individual, including copies and the envelope.
       3.16.1.3. Make copies for the individual.
       3.16.1.4. Contact the US Attorney's office to verify the effective date of service and identify the
       Assistant US Attorney handling the case.
   3.16.2. Follow initial contacts with a complete litigation report. In unusual situations, after getting
   telephone approval by AFLSA/JACL, you may send a copy of the report directly to the Assistant US
   Attorney. Use the format in paragraph 1.8.
34                                                                            AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002


Figure 3.1. Checklist Items for Preparation of an Administrative Record.

                CHECKLIST ITEMS FOR PREPARATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

1. Obtain ALL documentation related to the lawsuit.
2. Safeguard records of others (personnel records, IG Reports, promotion profiles) to prevent routine
retirement or destruction.
3. Keep the originals and make copies for the administrative record. Copies of two-sided documents
should be made single-sided.
4. Arrange documents into chronological order.
5. When practical, delete duplicates from the administrative record.
6. Bind records at top using Acco prong fasteners and pasteboard covers. Remember, this document will
likely be a court exhibit; professionalism counts!
7. Divide bulky records into volumes 1-1½ inches thick.
8. Prepare a master index and an index for each volume and insert behind the AF Form 44.
9. Paginate records at the lower right corner BEFORE making copies of the record. Continue numbering
consecutively in each volume (e.g., Vol. I—pages 1-100; Vol. II—pages 101-200; Vol. III—pages
201-266).
10. Reduce oversize pages to 8½” x 11”.
11. Have the appropriate records custodian certify the volumes on AF Forms 44. (See paragraph 8.3. for
information on procedures for the certification and authentication of records using the AF Form 44.)
12. Send one original AF Form 44 for each volume of the record. Attach each such form to the front of the
volume it is meant to authenticate.
13. Ensure that the description of the records on the AF Form 44 accurately describes the records (“This
is Volume II of III, pages 101-200”).
14. Do not fill in the bottom of the AF Form 44 or attach a seal—that will be accomplished at the Secre-
tary of the Air Force’s office.
15. Do not include any privileged material (including your litigation report) in the administrative record.
16. Retain a complete copy of the administrative record along with your litigation report to facilitate
future work on the case.
17. Send the original (the copy with the originally signed AF Form 44) and three copies of the administra-
tive record to JACL.
Final Points:
18. Keep the JACL action attorney advised of all local developments.
19. Remember that JACL is the focal point for all contact between the Air Force and the Assistant
US Attorney defending the case.
AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002                                                                            35


20. Forward copies of all notices of depositions, proposed answers to interrogatories, and other dis-
covery to JACL for approval prior to release to the Assistant US Attorney.

                                                  Chapter 4

                                        CONTRACT LITIGATION

4.1. Contract Litigation.
     4.1.1. The Commercial Litigation Division (AFLSA/JACN) assists DoJ in handling court actions
     based on or relating to contracts with the Air Force or its instrumentalities, including:
        4.1.1.1. Contract claims against the Air Force in any state or federal court.
        4.1.1.2. Actions seeking equitable relief, including temporary restraining orders and injunctions.
        4.1.1.3. Bankruptcy proceedings involving Air Force contractors.
     4.1.2. The Air Force Materiel Command Directorate of Contract Appeals (AFMC LO/JAB) handles
     contract cases involving litigation at the ASBCA.
     4.1.3. SAF/GCQ handles protest cases at the General Accounting Office (GAO).
     4.1.4. AFLSA/JACN assists DOJ with protest cases filed at the United States District Courts and
     United States Court of Federal Claims (COFC) unless SAF/GCQ elects to assist DoJ with the case.
     4.1.5. Patent, Copyright and Trademark cases. See Chapter 7.

4.2. Reporting Requirements. Fax or telephone AFLSA/JACN immediately when you learn of contract
litigation involving or arising out of activities of the Air Force or its instrumentalities, whether or not the
Air Force is a party to the litigation. Follow the initial contact with a litigation report in accordance with
paragraph 1.8., unless AFLSA/JACN directs otherwise.
     4.2.1. Title 28, United States Code 520(b) gives the information requirements for suits brought in the
     US Court of Federal Claims or the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on a contract, agree-
     ment, or transaction with any executive or military department. Make sure to fulfill these require-
     ments when handling such suits. If you have any questions about including particular information,
     contact AFLSA/JACN immediately. Note: You must adhere to AFLSA/JACN suspense dates to
     meet litigation deadlines imposed by court rules or DoJ direction.

4.3. Third Party Litigation. Contract litigation may require compliance with discovery requests for
actions in which the Air Force is not a named party, such as prime contractor or subcontractor suits. These
actions routinely seek information from the Air Force regarding an underlying contract.
     4.3.1. Unless it appears that this action might result in liability for the Air Force, you need not prepare
     a litigation report.
     4.3.2. Do notify AFLSA/JACN of these cases to ensure a consistent Air Force response.
     4.3.3. The SJA of the installation or unit or other individual responsible for litigation reporting must
     handle the subpoena or information request in accordance with DoD Directive 5405.2, Release of
     Official Information in Litigation and Testimony by DoD Personnel as Witnesses, and Chapter 9 of
     this instruction.
AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002                                                                               37


4.4. Contract Fraud Cases.
   4.4.1. SAF/GCQ assists DoJ in handling litigation, discovery, and settlement of contract fraud cases,
   including “qui tam” actions under the False Claims Act, Title 31, United States Code, Sections

                      ENVIRONMENTAL AND LAND USE LAW LITIGATION

5.1. Who Is Responsible . The Air Force Environmental Law and Litigation Division (AFLSA/JACE) is
primarily responsible for managing environmental and land use litigation involving the Department of the
Air Force. AFLSA/JACE works closely with DoJ and US Attorneys nationwide to deal with civil litiga-
tion concerning Air Force installations and various environmental protection statutes. AFLSA/JACE also
works closely with MAJCOM SJAs to deal with administrative litigation concerning Air Force installa-
tions and arising under the various environmental protection statutes. Installation SJAs must report all
actual or potential environmental or land use litigation to AFLSA/JACE, the appropriate MAJCOM SJA,
and the appropriate regional environmental counsel.

5.2. Reportable Environmental and Land Use Litigation . In addition to the reporting requirements
set forth in AFI 32-7047, Compliance Tracking And Reporting, reportable litigation includes, but is not
limited to:
     5.2.1. Suits; notices of intent to sue; notices of violation (NOVs); notices of noncompliance (NON);

       5.2.2.6. Any other litigation including quiet title and ejectment suits affecting Air Force real prop-
       erty interests. Report these actions informally through the MAJCOM SJA to AFLSA/JACE to
       determine if a substantive, formal litigation report is necessary.

5.3. Affirmative Litigation. Although the kinds of litigation in paragraph 5.2. are mainly defensive,
SJAs must report circumstances under which the Air Force may want to initiate litigation or join as an
intervenor or third party in litigation where the Air Force is not named as a party.
   5.3.1. Examples of civil cases would include:
       5.3.1.1. Proposals to establish landfills or waterfowl habitats near operational runways that might
       pose a substantial bird strike hazard.
       5.3.1.2. Annexation proposals (see paragraph 5.6.), e.g., local political subdivision expansion of

       5.3.2.3. Approval of permits that infringe upon the rights of Air Force interests.

5.4. Disputes of Environmental Fees (e.g. Fee/Tax) Issues. Generally, Air Force facilities are required
to pay environmental compliance and administrative fees. However, occasionally, such “fees” may in fact
be nonpayable taxes. When an SJA believes an environmental fee is not payable, the SJA should request
advice from AFLSA/JACE through the appropriate MAJCOM on whether or not the fee should be paid.
In general, an environmental fee is not payable when the fee is:
40                                                                             AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002


     5.4.1. Discriminatory in either application or effect;
     5.4.2. Used for a service denied to a federal agency;
     5.4.3. Assessed under a statute in which federal sovereign immunity has not been clearly and unam-
     biguously waived;
     5.4.4. Disproportionate to the intended service or use; or
     5.4.5. A financial assurance fee.

5.5. Reporting Environmental Litigation. SJAs must immediately report by telephone or electronic
mail any actual or possible environmental or land use litigation (including, but not limited to, notices of
intent to sue, notices of violation or other adverse documentation that could be resolved administratively
by any federal, state or local environmental authority, and FOIA requests pertaining to environmental
matters.) If electronic mail is used for reporting, it is the responsibility of the sender to ensure receipt.
     5.5.1. SJAs should report prospective litigation promptly, even if formal documentation, including,
     but not limited to, a complaint, process, or notice has not been received. Such reports should be made
     to AFLSA/JACE, the appropriate MAJCOM, and the appropriate regional environmental counsel.
     Typically, SJAs become aware of deficiencies that are likely to result in administrative action or liti-
     gation following inspections by state or local inspectors.
     5.5.2. Formal Litigation Reports.
        5.5.2.1. SJAs will prepare a formal litigation report in accordance with paragraph 1.8., when it
        appears AFLSA/JACE will have to defend Air Force interests in state or federal litigation or when
        otherwise directed by AFLSA/JACE.
        5.5.2.2. In addition to other materials required under paragraph 1.8., SJAs should be prepared to
        provide the following documentation, if relevant to the litigation:
            5.5.2.2.1. One copy of state or local statutes alleged to have been violated.
            5.5.2.2.2. One copy of relevant environmental permits.
            5.5.2.2.3. Five copies of an installation or area map, with annotations showing pollution con-
            trol facilities, construction sites, discharge points, easements, and other relevant features.
            5.5.2.2.4. Five copies of any relevant draft or final Environmental Impact Statement or assess-
            ment.
            5.5.2.2.5. One copy of any documents relating to consultations with other federal agencies
            (i.e., biological assessments and requests for consultation under the ESA).
            5.5.2.2.6. As many copies of all records pertaining to the litigation, such as correspondence,
            records, photography, or reports, as the particular case may require. AFLSA/JACE determines
            the quantity of such documents in each case.
            5.5.2.2.7. Electronic versions of the aforementioned documentation may be provided in lieu
            of paper documentation, unless otherwise directed by AFLSA/JACE. If electronic mail is used
            to deliver such documents, it is the responsibility of the sender to ensure receipt.
     5.5.3. Other litigation reporting requirements.
AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002                                                                                     41


       5.5.3.1. Administrative actions. SJAs must report to AFLSA/JACE, the servicing MAJCOM, and
       the appropriate regional environmental counsel any time a federal, state or local regulatory author-
       ity seeks a fine or penalty for a violation of an environmental law. This will usually occur when
       the federal, state or local regulatory agency issues adverse documentation (including, but not lim-
       ited to, an NOV, NON or field citation) informing the Air Force installation a fine is a possible
       consequence for the resolution of the alleged violation set forth in the adverse documentation.
       5.5.3.2. Settlement of Administrative actions.
          5.5.3.2.1. AFLSA/JACE must give approval before settlement of any administrative action
          where the terms of the settlement include provisions for the payment of fines (this includes set-
          tlement agreements that accept terms for stipulated penalties or suspended fines) or supple-
          mental environmental projects (SEP).
          5.5.3.2.2. SJAs requesting authority to settle administrative actions should forward such
          requests through the MAJCOM SJA to AFLSA/JACE for approval.
       5.5.3.3. SJAs must report to AFLSA/JACE, the servicing MAJCOM, and the appropriate regional
       environmental counsel whenever a federal, state or local regulatory authority initiates criminal
       action against an Air Force member or employee. (NOTE: Special interest case reporting proce-
       dures to AFLSA/JAJM would also apply to these cases. See AFI 51-201, Administration of Mili-
       tary Justice, paragraph 12.8., especially subparagraph 12.8.2.3.)
   5.5.4. SJAs must report the actual payment of any fines or penalties paid under environmental statutes
   to AFLSA/JACE through the MAJCOM SJA within 30 days of payment to the appropriate federal,
   state or local environmental authority.

5.6. Annexation Proposals.
   5.6.1. DoD Directive 4165.6, Real Property Acquisition, Management, And Disposal, September 1,
   1987, at paragraph (F)(2)(g), sets forth DoD policy on annexations of military installations by local
   communities or political entities. This directive states:
       “Annexation. It is DoD policy to be neutral relative to annexation by a municipality or political
       subdivision in accordance with State law, unless the Secretary of the Military Department
       concerned determines that such action would not be in the best interest of the Federal
       Government, or it is opposed by another local jurisdiction.”
   5.6.2. The installation SJA sends a report analyzing the potential impact of a proposed annexation
   that specifically addresses the impact of annexation on the right of the installation to contract for util-
   ity and waste disposal services to AFLSA/JACE and to AFLSA/JACL (ULT). If the right of the
   installation to contract for telephone services is impacted, a copy of the report should also be sent to
   38 EIW/JA, Tinker AFB, OK. [See paragraph 3.10.] Figure 5.1. outlines information that usually
   applies to annexation proceedings.

5.7. Rule-making Proceedings. Installation SJAs may submit comments on proposed state and local
rules after approval by the Division Chief, AFLSA/JACE. SJAs shall submit proposed comments to the
appropriate regional counsel office of AFLSA/JACE for obtaining such approval.

                                                    Chapter 6

                              CIVIL LITIGATION IN FOREIGN COURTS

6.1. Litigation Responsibility. The International and Operations Law Division (HQ USAF/JAI) moni-
tors foreign civil litigation involving the Air Force, its instrumentalities, and its officials, and supports
DoJ in its efforts to protect Air Force interests in foreign courts. Send foreign civil litigation reports per
paragraph 6.2.to HQ USAF/JAI.

6.2. Reporting Requirements. Report the following types of foreign suits, actions or disputes to HQ
USAF/JAI using the format in paragraph 1.8.
     6.2.1. Proceedings in which the United States has an interest but is not a named party defendant (i.e.,
     obligation under international agreement to share the expense of any judgment awarded).
     6.2.2. Disputes concerning the validity or refund of taxes assessed by a foreign authority against the
     property or transactions of the Air Force, its contractors or instrumentalities, including nonappropri-
     ated fund activities.
     6.2.3. Legal actions arising out of Air Force contracts, subcontracts and purchase orders, bankruptcy,
     receivership, assignment, and probate proceedings that affect the interests of the United States.
     6.2.4. Proceedings involving proposed new or amended administrative rules or regulations of a for-
     eign government or agency that may affect the Air Force mission.
     6.2.5. Legal process of foreign courts affecting the Air Force or Air Force personnel in their official
     capacity.

6.3. Reporting Methods.
     6.3.1. Electronic Reporting. The reporting authority submits an initial message, datafax or electronic
     mail to HQ USAF/JAI, with an information copy to the MAJCOM, immediately on receiving notice
     of the start of a foreign suit, action, or proceeding that requires reporting. (See paragraph 6.2.) If
     datafax or electronic mail is used, it is the responsibility of the sender to ensure its receipt. This initial
     report precedes the formal litigation report (see paragraph 1.8.) and explains the subject of the action.
     Both reports should be identified as attorney work product. For the European theater, HQ USAFE/JA
     is responsible for advising DoJ’s European Office of all initiated suits.
     6.3.2. Confirming Letter. Reporting authorities confirm each electronic message by sending a letter
     (see paragraph 6.4.) Attach 2 legible copies of each legal document, memorandum, and letter that
     applies to the foreign suit, action, or proceeding.
     6.3.3. Litigation Report. Send the litigation reports immediately following initial notification to allow
     time for other government departments to comment or act before issuing instructions on how to
     defend civil cases that arise in foreign jurisdictions.

6.4. Report Contents. Include in each report:
     6.4.1. All information per paragraph 1.8.
     6.4.2. A recommendation on which qualified local counsel (preferably bilingual) should handle the
     case. Choose a counsel from the list of attorneys maintained by the nearest US embassy or consulate.
AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002                                                                                    45


6.5. Follow-up Action.
   6.5.1. Advise HQ USAF/JAI fully and promptly of all later developments.
   6.5.2. Send HQ USAF/JAI two copies of all pertinent correspondence and documents.
   6.5.3. Send information copies to the MAJCOM/JA and NAF/JA (see paragraph 6.3.)

6.6. Commencement of Proceedings.
   6.6.1. Foreign Jurisdiction. The defense of sovereign immunity or a lack of jurisdiction of a foreign
   court may be proper only when the United States or one of its agencies or instrumentalities is a named
   party defendant, and in such event may be asserted only with the prior approval of DoJ and TJAG.
   6.6.2. Suits Against the United States. Send to the SJA any writ, summons, notice of legal proceed-
   ings, or other foreign civil process delivered to an Air Force officer, employee, or activity immedi-
   ately on receipt.
      6.6.2.1. The SJA then returns the document to the issuing authority, with a suitable statement
      respectfully and tactfully explaining the lack of authority of the person or activity to accept service
      on behalf of the United States, and suggesting that service or delivery be made on the US Embassy
      through established channels, or on the Department of Justice, Washington, DC, under the 1965
      Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or
      Commercial Matters. Their address is Office of International Judicial Assistance, Civil Division,
      Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530. SJAs should also forward courtesy copies of these
      documents, including their written statement, to this DoJ office.
      6.6.2.2. No exceptions to this procedure exist except with prior approval from TJAG and DoJ, and
      clearance from the chief of the US diplomatic mission in the country. (See Figure 6.1. for a model
      letter returning such a process).
      6.6.2.3. Refer questions concerning this policy to HQ USAF/JAI.
   6.6.3. Suits Against United States Government Agencies and Instrumentalities.
      6.6.3.1. United States Government agencies and instrumentalities in foreign countries, such as
      military units and installations, installation exchanges, open messes, and military missions, lack
      juridical personality under United States law. Such government activities of the United States gen-
      erally are not subject to civil proceedings or service of process in foreign countries. Claims nomi-
      nally against such activities are in law suits against the United States.
      6.6.3.2. Except for proceedings against US personnel arising outside of performance of official
      duties, the United States is the only proper party defendant or respondent in any foreign civil pro-
      ceedings.
      6.6.3.3. The US embassy in that country is the only United States activity that may receive and
      accept service of foreign process.
      6.6.3.4. In suits against United States Government agencies and instrumentalities, the SJA returns
      the foreign process to the issuing authority with a suitable statement respectfully and tactfully
      explaining the lack of juridical personality on the part of the United States Government agency or
      instrumentality involved. (See Figure 6.1. for model letter returning process).
   6.6.4. Suits Against Individuals Acting in an Official Capacity.
46                                                                               AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002


        6.6.4.1. These guidelines apply to civil suits, actions, and proceedings in foreign countries against
        individual members or employees of the Air Force for acts or omissions arising out of the perfor-
        mance of their official duties.
        6.6.4.2. The guidelines on returning process to issuing authorities do not apply if TJAG decides
        that applying them is inconsistent with pertinent provisions of a status of forces or similar agree-
        ment, or that applying them may adversely affect the defense of such suits in that country.
        6.6.4.3. When a process on its face establishes that the act or omission complained of is patently
        a governmental act:
            6.6.4.3.1. Return it to the issuing authorities with a letter signed by the SJA explaining that the
            act or omission complained of was performed by the subject while acting as an official of the
            Air Force or an agency of the United States Government, and in the performance of official
            duties under superior orders.
            6.6.4.3.2. Further state that in legal effect the subject is not the proper party defendant. The
            letter should not contain any express statement that suit should be brought against the United
            States, as this is an improper invitation of suits against the United States.
        6.6.4.4. When a process does not on its face establish that the act was governmental:
            6.6.4.4.1. Return it with a similar letter of explanation to that described above.
            6.6.4.4.2. Attach a certified statement from the member’s immediate commander attesting to
            the employment or military status of the individual and indicating that the individual was per-
            forming official duties at the time and place when the alleged act occurred.
            6.6.4.4.3. If the issuing authority rejects the return of process:
                6.6.4.4.3.1. Allow the service of the process according to applicable international agree-
                ment and local law and procedures.
                   6.6.4.4.3.1.1. If proper service is obtained, the defendant must defend the suit, and the
                   defendant must prove during the trial that the occurrence was part of his or her official
                   duties.
     6.6.5. Garnishment and Attachment Proceedings. As a general rule, the United States and its agencies
     and instrumentalities are not subject to garnishment orders or money attachment proceedings in for-
     eign countries aimed at wages or other funds due and payable by the United States to alleged or adju-
     dicated debtors of the parties on whose behalf garnishment or attachment is attempted.
        6.6.5.1. An exception to this rule exists in the Federal Republic of Germany. Under Article 34(3),
        German Supplementary Agreement to the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, the United States
        must (see Public Law 93-647, Social Services Amendments of 1974, January 4, 1975) honor writs
        of garnishment issued by German courts against members of US forces or civilian component sta-
        tioned in the Federal Republic of Germany for child support or alimony obligations. Consult the
        DoD Military Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual, paragraph 70710.
        6.6.5.2. In all other cases, the United States cannot honor garnishment orders or money attach-
        ments. You may cooperate with the foreign judicial and administrative authorities and advise of
        the date, time, and place of payment to the debtor. The creditor can exercise legal rights directly
        against the debtor without submitting the United States or its activities to the jurisdiction of the
AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002                                                                                   47


      foreign court or agency. Upon receipt of any writ, order, or petition for garnishment or money
      attachment served on, or otherwise delivered to an Air Force officer, employee, or activity, refer
      such document to the SJA.
      6.6.5.3. If the United States cannot honor the garnishment or money attachment request, per para-
      graph 6.6.5.2., the SJA returns it to the issuing authority.
          6.6.5.3.1. The SJA advises the foreign court or other agency that the US military authorities
          will cooperate with the local authorities to allow the creditor to pursue remedies under local
          law directly against the debtor. (See Figure 6.1. for a model letter.)
          6.6.5.3.2. If the debtor is a United States citizen or resident alien, release only information
          authorized under the Privacy Act (see AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program).
          6.6.5.3.3. Send full electronic report of each case immediately to the NAF/JA, MAJCOM/JA,
          and HQ USAF/JAI.
      6.6.5.4. If the United States can honor the garnishment or money attachment request, per para-
      graph 6.6.5.1., the MAJCOM SJA will implement procedures for processing such requests. Send
      a full report of each case immediately to the NAF/JA, MAJCOM/JA, and HQ USAF/JAI.

6.7. Defending Against Foreign Suits and Proceedings.
   6.7.1. DoJ prosecutes and defends in all foreign courts all civil suits by or against the United States,
   US agencies, US instrumentalities, or officials and employees whose official conduct is involved. The
   information contained in reports made under this chapter constitutes the basis for a report by HQ
   USAF to DoJ and for an Air Force recommendation to that Department as to the action to be taken in
   the case. DoJ, in turn, takes action to ensure that steps are taken to institute or defend the suit.
   6.7.2. United States Government Representation of an Individual. DoJ represents military personnel
   and civilian employees of the Air Force being sued in foreign courts because of actions they took in
   the line of duty in the performance of their official duties.
      6.7.2.1. DoJ decides for each case if it will provide representation or permit the Air Force to do so.
      6.7.2.2. Submit requests for United States Government representation in foreign courts (see para-
      graph 1.3.) in writing through HQ USAF/JAI.
      6.7.2.3. The United States Government does not pay for private counsel that individuals hire with-
      out specific authorization and will not pay any judgment against the individual (see paragraphs
      1.3.and 1.4.).
   6.7.3. United States Government Representation of an Air Force Contractor. If an Air Force contrac-
   tor requests United States Government representation before a foreign civil court, contact HQ USAF/
   JAI for guidance and follow the procedures in paragraph 1.3.
   6.7.4. Obtaining a Continuance. If the date set for a hearing does not allow enough time to retain
   United States Government counsel, the SJA, in consultation with DoJ, may be instructed to attempt to
   get a continuance.
      6.7.4.1. In attempting to obtain such continuance, the SJA does not appear in court or do anything
      else that can be construed as a defense or a legal appearance.
      6.7.4.2. Advise HQ USAF/JAI electronically of all such attempts.
48                                                                               AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002


     6.7.5. Cooperating with Foreign Counsel. SJAs will give information and evidence to foreign counsel
     that DoJ retains to represent US interests.
     6.7.6. Communicating with DoJ. DoJ retains, instructs, and pays foreign counsel.
        6.7.6.1. The retained counsel keeps in touch with DoJ.
        6.7.6.2. SJAs are encouraged, as the need arises, to communicate directly with DoJ and, where
        necessary, their retained counsel. Back brief NAF/JA and MAJCOM/JA, as appropriate.
     6.7.7. Handling Administrative Legal Problems in Civil Litigation. Do not consult with foreign coun-
     sel retained by DoJ on administrative legal problems collateral to the civil litigation. When the local
     SJA cannot resolve such problems, refer them to the next higher command.

6.8. Suing in a Foreign Court.
     6.8.1. The United States may:
        6.8.1.1. Sue for money damages.
        6.8.1.2. Petition for injunctive relief.
        6.8.1.3. Sue for the return of personal or real property.
        6.8.1.4. Sue for the specific performance of a contract.
     6.8.2. DoJ prosecutes civil suits for the United States. The DoJ will:
        6.8.2.1. Quickly identify the basis for any legal action.
        6.8.2.2. Notify HQ USAF/JAI promptly.
     6.8.3. If a contractor is facing criminal proceedings based on an activity or transaction for which the
     United States may sue in civil court, the SJA shall notify HQ USAF/JAI immediately. When such
     action serves the interest of the United States, DoJ can intervene as a complainant in the criminal case.
     6.8.4. After you identify a wrong and deem action proper, the SJA shall alert DoJ immediately by
     message to HQ USAF/JAI. Include:
        6.8.4.1. A description of the facts of the case.
        6.8.4.2. A discussion of the local law that applies to the dispute.
        6.8.4.3. An analysis of why a suit is appropriate.
        6.8.4.4. Date at which the applicable statute of limitations will run.
        6.8.4.5. Amount of claim or relief sought.
        6.8.4.6. Nature of anticipated defenses or counterclaims.
        6.8.4.7. Other interested parties or possible intervenors.
        6.8.4.8. Efforts made to collect the debt or seek other relief before filing suit.
        6.8.4.9. Recommendation for selection of local counsel, with cost and fee estimate.
        6.8.4.10. Statement of availability of witnesses and evidence.
AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002                                                                                  49

ment and Attachment Proceedings.
FORMAT FOR LETTER RETURNING FOREIGN PROCESS AND TENDERING ASSIS-
TANCE IN GARNISHMENT AND ATTACHMENT PROCEEDINGS
SUBJECT: (Identification of process)
TO: (Court or other authority from which process issued)
   1. Enclosed is the (identification of process) which was delivered by (mode of delivery, for example,
      mail or personal tender) to (individual or unit by which process was received) at (place of deliv-
      ery) on (date of delivery).
   2. Under the law of the United States, the (unit or activity to which process is directed) is a govern-
      ment agency or instrumentality that possesses no independent juridical personality, and thus is not
      itself amenable to civil process. The claim asserted in the present proceeding is a claim against the
      United States, and the only agency empowered to receive service of foreign process in such cases
      is the United States Embassy or Diplomatic Mission within the country concerned. Usually, ser-
      vice of process upon the Embassy or Diplomatic Mission is accomplished through diplomatic
      channels. Alternatively, service may also be possible on the United States Department of Justice,
      Washington D.C., under the 1965 Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and
      Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters. Their address is Office of International
      Judicial Assistance, Civil Division, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. 20530.
   3. Although circumstances outlined above require the return of this (identification of process), and
      without prejudice to the immunities enjoyed by the United States as sovereign, I can furnish you
      the date, time, and place of payments to be made to the debtor so that the creditor may pursue
      remedies under local law directly against the debtor. In this regard, the sum of (amount of pay-
      ment, expressed in local currency) will be paid to (name of debtor) at (place of payment) on (date
      of payment) at (time of payment). (If the debtor is an employee, include statement of future pay-
      ment schedule.)

     7.2.3. Provides any necessary additional information and assistance to DoJ.

7.3. Obtaining Information and Documents for Responses.
     7.3.1. AFLSA/JACN may request Air Force activities to provide information and documents to it for
     use by DoJ.
     7.3.2. When an Air Force activity receives such a request, it should fax or express mail the requested
     information and documents to AFLSA/JACN.
     7.3.3. The activity must meet any set time limits or send an interim report to AFLSA/JACN in suffi-

                                                   Chapter 8

        AUTHENTICATING OFFICIAL AIR FORCE RECORDS FOR ADMISSION INTO
                                  EVIDENCE

8.1. Terms.
     8.1.1. Official Air Force Records. All documents, records, or papers which are required by the
     Department of the Air Force to be prepared or processed and retained.
     8.1.2. Custodian. A person in charge of an office in which official Air Force records are filed by law,
     regulation, or custom, or a person whom proper authority so designates; and for certain purposes, a
     person who has physical possession of official Air Force records for use in official duties.

8.2. Rules of Evidence. The rules of evidence at common law and various statutes specify how to
authenticate documents and records for use as evidence. Methods include:
     8.2.1. Oral testimony.
     8.2.2. Authenticated copies of public records.
     8.2.3. Other authorized methods. The method of authenticating official Air Force records specified in
     this chapter does not prevent proof of genuineness by any other authorized method.

8.3. Authenticating Official Records. Custodians must authenticate official Air Force records.
     8.3.1. Civilian Judicial or Quasi-Judicial Proceedings:
        8.3.1.1. An official Air Force record or an entry in it may be evidenced by an official publication
        thereof in the Federal Register, or the record custodian may authenticate a copy and certify that he
        or she has lawful custody of that record.
            8.3.1.1.1. Use AF Form 44 to authenticate official Air Force records and copies or extracts
            from them.
            8.3.1.1.2. Prepare the first certificate (the top part of AF Form 44) and forward it to the HQ
            USAF or AFLSA division handling the case together with the documents being authenticated.
            (See Figure 8.1.)
            8.3.1.1.3. Submit only the copies that have been requested for certification.
        8.3.1.2. Charge individuals requesting documents who are not from federal agencies for:
            8.3.1.2.1. Search time.
            8.3.1.2.2. Document reproduction.
            8.3.1.2.3. Certifying and validating the document.
        8.3.1.3. Send a letter to the appropriate AFLSA civil litigation division or HQ USAF/JAI indicat-
        ing that you:
            8.3.1.3.1. Billed the requester, and
            8.3.1.3.2. For records subject to the Privacy Act, that you worked within its guidelines, with a
            description of your reasons for releasing the records.
AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002                                                                                        53


       8.3.1.4. The Secretary of the Air Force or designee signs under the second certificate (the bottom
       part of the form) and affixes the Air Force seal to the AF Form 44. This procedure satisfies FRCP,
       Rule 44, for admitting official Air Force records as evidence and usually satisfies state jurisdiction
       requirements too.
   8.3.2. Getting Assistance from the SJA. Custodians of official Air Force records should consult their
   SJA or the responsible AFLSA/JAC litigation division on preparing AF Form 44.
   8.3.3. Voluminous Records. Divide voluminous records at logical points and put a covering AF Form
   44 on each section. Unless otherwise specified by court rules, each section should be no more than
   1½” thick.
   8.3.4. Freedom of Information Act, Privacy Act, and Chapter 9. When releasing official Air Force
   records to other than federal agencies, ensure the material is releasable under the Freedom of Informa-
   tion Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, that the privacy of individuals, under the requirements of the Privacy Act, 5
   U.S.C. 552a, has been satisfied, and Chapter 9 of this instruction has been followed. When respond-
   ing to requests from other non-DoD federal agencies, comply with the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a,
   and systems notices made pursuant to the Privacy Act.

8.4. Offering Records into Evidence.
   8.4.1. Do not offer official Air Force records physically into evidence unless they can be withdrawn
   and a copy substituted for the original. Copies of Air Force records, authenticated as provided in this
   chapter, are usually admissible in evidence instead of the actual records.
   8.4.2. If the custodian of official Air Force records certifies that after diligent search no record or
   entry of a specified matter exists in the records of his or her office, that certificate is admissible as evi-
   dence of such fact.
       8.4.2.1. See Figure 8.2. for instructions and exact wording to use when you cannot find records.
       8.4.2.2. Forward AF Form 44 for completion.
54                                                                  AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002

     official status within the Department while such personnel were employed by or on behalf of the

     considered private include the personal bankruptcy, civil consumer, divorce (except where the pay-
     ment of child support or alimony, or the division or withholding of active duty, civilian or retired pay
     is involved), landlord-tenant or similar litigation of individual Air Force civilian or military personnel,

Section 9B—Release of Official Information

9.3. Release Authorities for Official Information. The following personnel are the release authorities
for official Air Force information in the following litigation situations:
   9.3.1. SJAs are the release authorities for official, unclassified factual information in private litigation
   cases. In lieu of an available SJA, Secretariat personnel should consult with SAF/GC.
   9.3.2. Likewise, Medical Law Consultants (MLCs) are the release authorities for official, unclassified
   factual information in private litigation, to the extent it involves the release of medical and other
   records and information within the custody, control or knowledge of their permanent station hospital
   and its personnel.
   9.3.3. For official information to be used in litigation before the Armed Services Board of Contract
   Appeals, contracting officers, in consultation with the appropriate servicing SJA, are authorized to
   release such information per the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), subpart 5.4., and applicable
   DoD directives and Air Force instructions. Responses to such requests must be coordinated with the
   assigned trial attorney at the AFMC LO/JAB, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5000.
   9.3.4. The responsible AFLSA civil litigation division or HQ USAF/JAI (for official information to
   be released to, or used in, foreign courts) releases all official, unclassified Air Force information in
   cases in which the United States is a party or has a direct or indirect interest; they also make all such
   release decisions for cases in which the information could be used in a claim or litigation against the
   United States.

9.4. Applicability to Former and Retired Air Force Personnel. Former and retired Air Force person-
nel who have possession of or access to official Air Force information, including classified information,
are also required to follow the procedures in this section to obtain permission from the Air Force to
release such information.

9.5. Factors in Releasing Official Information or Testimony. Release authorities ensure requesters
state in writing the nature and relevance of the official information they want and include as much detail
as possible. The appropriate release authority then uses this information to evaluate the request in light of
DoDD 5405.2 (32 C.F.R., Part 97) and United States, ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951). Before
releasing official information, release authorities consider these questions:
   9.5.1. Is the demand or request unduly burdensome or otherwise irrelevant?
   9.5.2. Does the demand or request specify remedial information that is inadmissible under the rules of
   evidence, or is the information otherwise inappropriate under the applicable court rules?
   9.5.3. Would disclosing this information (including release in camera) be appropriate under the rules
   of procedure governing the case and under the relevant substantive law concerning the appropriate
   privilege?
   9.5.4. Would disclosing the information violate any statute, executive order, regulation, or directive?
   Release documents subject to the Privacy Act only with consent of the individual or under a court
   order or subpoena specifically signed by a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction. Because an
   order against the United States is an order against the sovereign, what is considered to be a court of
   competent jurisdiction under the Privacy Act is subject to interpretation. [See 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(11);
   Doe v. DiGenova, 779 F.2d 74 (D.C. Cir 1985); Bosaw v. NTEU, 887 F. Supp. 1199 (S.D. Ind. 1995);
60                                                                               AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002


     and Boron Oil Co. v. Downie, 873 F. 2d 67 (4th Cir. 1989).] Please refer any questions to the appropri-
     ate civil litigation division.
     9.5.5. Would disclosing the information, except in camera to assert a claim of privilege, reveal classi-
     fied or other restricted information? Particularly, would it reveal:
        9.5.5.1. Data under DoD 5200-1-R, Information Security Program, January 1997 or AFI 31-401,
        Information Security Program Management?
        9.5.5.2. Unclassified technical data withheld from public release pursuant to DoD Directive
        5230.25, Withholding of Unclassified Technical Data From Public Disclosure, November 6, 1984
        (including Change 1, August 18, 1995)?
        9.5.5.3. Privileged safety information or documents contained in safety investigation board (SIB)
        reports conducted under AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations And Reports, and restricted from pub-
        lic release by DoD Instruction 6055.7, Accident Investigation, Reporting and Recordkeeping,
        October 3, 2000?
        9.5.5.4. Other matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure?
     9.5.6. Would disclosure interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional
     rights, reveal the identity of an intelligence source or confidential informant, disclose trade secrets or
     similarly confidential commercial or financial information, or otherwise be inappropriate under the
     circumstances?

9.6. Classified Information. No one, including release authorities, shall release classified official infor-
mation to courts or unauthorized persons under any circumstances, unless proper authority first declassi-
fies the material.
     9.6.1. When requesters ask for classified information that classification authorities cannot declassify
     at lower levels, Air Force personnel, through their SJAs, shall notify the appropriate civil litigation
     division of AFLSA or HQ USAF/JAI (if a foreign court is involved).
     9.6.2. Pending a final decision, the servicing SJA (or SAF/GC) shall ensure the requester, court, or
     other authority is furnished with a copy of Title 32, C.F.R., Part 97 (DoD Directive 5405.2) and this
     chapter and shall inform the requester that the request is under review. If necessary, SJAs will work to
     obtain a stay of the request or demand pending a final determination.

9.7. Defending Denials. For decisions denying official information within the authority of SJAs, SJAs
are authorized to consult directly with local United States attorneys or DoJ litigation attorneys to defend
such decisions from subpoenas, court orders, or other legal challenges before local, state or federal courts,
administrative bodies or other tribunals. Before any such consultation, however, SJAs are first required to
notify the appropriate civil litigation division of AFLSA or HQ USAF/JAI of the need to consult, provid-
ing a brief factual background of the case and giving the reasons for such consultation.

9.8. Releasing Official Information to DoJ. DoJ and its US Attorneys represent the government's inter-
est in judicial proceedings involving the Air Force.
     9.8.1. SJAs may release unclassified official information that is not privileged to DoJ or the US Attor-
     ney on request.
AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002                                                                                    61


   9.8.2. SJAs must send DOJ or US Attorney requests for classified information that cannot be declas-
   sified at lower levels, or for other privileged official information, to the responsible AFLSA civil liti-
   gation division or HQ USAF/JAI for a decision.

9.9. Fees. Persons releasing copies of records and other documentary material collect fees from the
requester according to the fee schedule in Chapter 6 of DoD 5400.7-R/AF Supplement, DOD Freedom of
Information Act Program, or 32 C.F.R. 97. 6(d).

9.10. Sending Requests. When an SJA requests a decision on releasing official information from an
AFLSA civil litigation division or HQ USAF/JAI, he or she should provide the following information:
   9.10.1. Name of litigation and parties.
   9.10.2. Name and location of the court or tribunal.
   9.10.3. Date the litigation began and date of requested appearance.
   9.10.4. Name and address of requester and of party who has the requested official information.
   9.10.5. Type of action, subject matter, and a statement of the relevancy of the requested information.
   9.10.6. Copies of documents requested, or a complete description of them if they are bulky or numer-
   ous.
   9.10.7. Recommendations on release and any other pertinent information.

9.11. Complying With Subpoenas.
   9.11.1. SJAs give legal advice to Air Force personnel under subpoena to appear and testify concern-
   ing official information.
       9.11.1.1. When the proper release authority prohibits releasing the subpoenaed information, and
       the information does not include Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) material, the person receiving the
       subpoena, with the assistance of the appropriate legal office, attempts to resolve the matter with
       the attorney requesting the information or issuing the subpoena, or appears and explains the matter
       to the court. When Privacy Act material is involved, the SJA's office should assist the subpoenaed
       person to:
          9.11.1.1.1. Determine if a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction personally issued the sub-
          poena; and
          9.11.1.1.2. Make or negotiate an adequate response, or appear before the court, as appropriate.
          9.11.1.1.3. Where another release authority has been involved, SJAs should also consult with
          that authority, as necessary or appropriate.
       9.11.1.2. If the court or requesting attorney is not satisfied and persists in requesting the informa-
       tion, the witness respectfully asks for time to send the request to the appropriate AFLSA civil liti-
       gation division or HQ USAF/JAI for a final Air Force decision and possible assistance from DoJ.
       9.11.1.3. Judge advocates may accompany and advise the witness concerning a problem on
       release of official information.
62                                                                              AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002


     9.11.2. When a subpoena calls for classified or otherwise unreleasable information outside of their
     release authority, SJAs, after the approval of the appropriate AFLSA civil litigation division or HQ
     USAF/JAI, may:
        9.11.2.1. Communicate with the counsel requesting the subpoena.
        9.11.2.2. Explain the restrictions on release.
        9.11.2.3. Give the attorney releasable information.
        9.11.2.4. Suggest withdrawing the subpoena.
     9.11.3. Promptly report any subpoenas from foreign courts requiring records, files, or documents to
     HQ USAF/JAI.

9.12. Authenticating Documents. Authenticate official Air Force documents for civil litigation, rather
than requiring the custodian to personally appear and testify. The authentication procedure in Chapter 8
meets the requirements of federal courts and of most state courts and administrative bodies. Use the sim-
plest authentication procedure permissible.

Section 9C—Witness Testimony by Former and Current Air Force Personnel

9.13. Release Authorities for Witness Testimony. The following personnel are the release authorities
to allow witness testimony by former, retired and current Air Force personnel in the following litigation
situations:
     9.13.1. SJAs are the release authorities for individuals who may appear for witness testimony, depo-
     sitions, or interviews or make declarations on factual matters within their personal knowledge when it
     involves private litigation. In lieu of an available SJA, Secretariat personnel should consult with SAF/
     GC.
     9.13.2. MLCs are the release authorities for medical providers and other hospital personnel assigned
     to the MLC’s permanent station hospital who may appear for witness testimony, depositions, or inter-
     views or make declarations on factual matters within their personal knowledge when it involves pri-
     vate litigation.
     9.13.3. The chief of the appropriate civil litigation division of AFLSA or the chief of HQ USAF/JAI,
     in coordination with DoJ litigation attorneys, decides if Air Force personnel may appear and testify as
     witnesses in contemplated or pending litigation where the United States is a party or has a direct or
     indirect interest. They also determine what conditions to impose on such appearance or testimony, or
     on the release of official information related to it.
     9.13.4. The chief of the responsible AFLSA civil litigation division or the chief of HQ USAF/JAI (for
     cases in foreign courts) are denial authorities for expert or opinion testimony. AFLSA/JAC is the
     release authority for expert or opinion testimony. (See paragraph 9.20. below.)

9.14. Voluntariness of Testimony in Private Litigation. When a release authority grants permission to
Air Force personnel to provide statements or testify for prospective or actual private litigation, such state-
ments and depositions are voluntary with the individual concerned, unless required by valid legal process
or the order of competent military authority.
AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002                                                                                       63


9.15. Limitations After the Testimony of Air Force Personnel Is Approved. When the release of
official information is involved, Air Force personnel may produce, disclose, release, comment upon, or
testify concerning only those matters that the requester specifies in writing and which the Air Force spe-
cifically approves, except under court order, by a court of competent jurisdiction. Air Force personnel do
not give opinion or expert testimony without specific approval (see paragraph 9.20.).

9.16. Witnesses in Private Litigation.
   9.16.1. Air Force personnel may appear and testify in their nonofficial capacity in private litigation in
   which the United States has no interest if:
       9.16.1.1. This chapter does not prohibit releasing the requested information.
       9.16.1.2. The government incurs no expense.
   9.16.2. Except as noted below, Air Force personnel testifying in their nonofficial capacity in private
   litigation may do so only in other than a duty status. Examples of such status during what would oth-

   ings that do not directly involve the Air Force or its interests may receive permissive temporary duty
   per AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, at no expense to the government.
   9.17.2. Military personnel returning from an overseas area to appear as a witness may use space avail-
   able military transportation per DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, November 1994.

   graph U7062.
       9.17.3.1. Installations receiving such requests should report the request to AFLSA/JACL.

     9.18.5. When a private party in litigation with the United States requests or subpoenas Air Force per-
     sonnel to testify, promptly report it to the SJA.

        9.18.5.2. When the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeal requests or subpoenas Air Force
        personnel to testify, report it to the AFMC LO/JAB, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5000.
AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002                                                                                   65


       9.18.5.3. Air Force military personnel testifying in a nonofficial capacity must ensure they are not
       in a duty status while appearing and testifying.
       9.18.5.4. Air Force civilian personnel testifying in a judicial proceeding in a nonofficial capacity
       may receive court leave per 5 U.S.C. 6322 and DOD Financial Management Regulation, Volume
       8, Chapter 5, § 0513. Otherwise, they must use annual leave or leave without pay.

9.19. Appearing at State or Local Legislative Hearings. Air Force personnel appearing or testifying,
personally or in writing, before state and local legislative bodies for the Air Force on legislative issues
must obtain prior approval from Headquarters United States Air Force, General Law Division (HQ
USAF/JAG), 1420 Air Force Pentagon Rm 5E409, Washington DC 20330-1420, telephone (703)
614-4075 or (DSN) 224-4075.
   9.19.1. Submit approval requests through command channels. Detail the proposed testimony. HQ
   USAF/JAG normally approves this type of request only:
       9.19.1.1. To serve a significant Air Force interest.
       9.19.1.2. When no conflict of interest exists.
   9.19.2. Unless serving an Air Force or DoD objective, the witness and the legislative body will pay
   the expenses.

9.20. Expert or Opinion Testimony of Air Force Personnel.
   9.20.1. Air Force personnel do not provide opinion or expert testimony concerning official Air Force
   or DoD information, subjects, or activities, except on behalf of the United States or for a party that
   DoJ represents.
       9.20.1.1. Under unique circumstances and when testimony will not adversely affect the interests
       of the Air Force or the United States, special authorization for Air Force personnel to appear and
       testify as an expert witness in private litigation at no expense to the United States may be granted.
       Requests for such special authorization must be coordinated, via the appropriate organization SJA,
       with the responsible AFLSA civil litigation division (including JACC for hospital recovery
       actions) or, in foreign jurisdiction cases, HQ USAF/JAI. The responsible AFLSA civil litigation
       division or HQ USAF/JAI or may deny the request, or forward it with a recommendation for
       approval, through AFLSA/JACL, to AFLSA/JAC. AFLSA/JAC is the approval authority for
       requests for special authorization to provide expert or opinion testimony.
       9.20.1.2. If, despite a negative final determination by AFLSA/JAC, judicial or other appropriate
       governmental authorities order Air Force personnel to appear and testify, notify AFLSA/JAC.
           9.20.1.2.1. If AFLSA/JAC decides not to seek further legal review or challenge to the court's
           order, Air Force personnel comply.
           9.20.1.2.2. The Air Force may direct Air Force personnel not to testify, in which case affected
           Air Force personnel must respectfully decline to comply with the demand. See United States
           ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).
       9.20.1.3. The Air Force must maintain strict impartiality in private litigation. If Air Force person-
       nel provide expert or opinion testimony in private litigation, such testimony frequently requires
       discussing their current position and duty experience. This can easily create the impression that
66                                                                             AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002


        the Air Force favors a particular finding, even though it has no official interest in the outcome of
        the litigation. Furthermore, the efforts of the litigants to obtain such testimony may interfere with
        the normal functions of Air Force personnel.
     9.20.2. Civilian counsel who want Air Force personnel to give expert or opinion testimony submit
     requests to the servicing SJA.
        9.20.2.1. The SJA reviews the request and sends it with a recommendation for approval or disap-
        proval to the responsible AFLSA civil litigation division or, in foreign jurisdiction cases, HQ
        USAF/JAI. For hospital recovery actions, coordinate the request with AFLSA/JACC. The respon-
        sible AFLSA civil litigation division, AFLSA/JACC, or HQ USAF/JAI may deny the request, or
        forward it with a recommendation for approval, through AFLSA/JACL, to AFLSA/JAC. AFLSA/
        JAC is the approval authority for these requests.
        9.20.2.2. The request should include:
            9.20.2.2.1. Name of litigation and parties.
            9.20.2.2.2. Name and location of the court or tribunal.
            9.20.2.2.3. Date the litigation began and date of the requested appearance.
            9.20.2.2.4. Party for whom the request is made.
            9.20.2.2.5. Name, grade, position, and organization of the witness.
            9.20.2.2.6. Type of action, subject matter, and nature of testimony.
            9.20.2.2.7. Detailed statement showing why the Air Force should grant an exception.
     9.20.3. Air Force personnel in a nonofficial capacity may not provide expert review of evidence in
     private litigation where one of the parties in the litigation may request expert or opinion testimony
     from Air Force personnel.
        9.20.3.1. SJAs will keep Air Force personnel aware of this provision.
        9.20.3.2. After receiving approval of AFLSA/JAC to testify as an expert, Air Force personnel
        may then engage in such expert review.
     9.20.4. The Air Force does not usually consider course of treatment testimony by a treating physician
     to be expert or opinion testimony. A treating physician may testify as to his or her examination, treat-
     ment, and prognosis for a patient. However, if the scope or direction of the physician’s testimony is
     expected or likely to go beyond these areas into others involving the physician’s professional opinion
     or specialized knowledge, the physician must be treated as providing expert or opinion testimony that
     would require permission per the requirements of paragraph 9.20.1. and 9.20.2.

9.21. Expert or Opinion Testimony by Former Air Force Personnel. Former Air Force personnel
may not provide expert or opinion testimony about any matter in which they had a direct involvement
while employed by the government or serving on active duty, unless they first obtain special authorization
via the procedures outlined in paragraph 9.20.

9.22. Travel of Witnesses to Overseas Areas. Report requests for travel of witnesses to overseas areas
to testify in foreign criminal cases to HQ USAF/JAI.
     9.22.1. The Air Force does not usually fund such travel.
AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002                                                                                    67


   9.22.2. The requester must prove that the trip serves official purposes.
   9.22.3. The requesting command usually funds necessary official travel of witnesses in foreign crim-
   inal courts.

9.23. Travel Expenses for Witnesses.
   9.23.1. 28 U.S.C. 1821 and the JFTR/JTR govern travel allowances for Air Force personnel appear-
   ing as witnesses in litigation.
   9.23.2. JFTR paragraphs U7060 and U7061 apply to military personnel, and JTR paragraph C4502
   applies to Air Force civilian personnel employed by appropriated fund activities.
   9.23.3. The Air Force pays travel expenses for Air Force personnel assigned to Air Force activities
   who are appearing as witnesses for the United States. The unit issuing orders funds travel.
   9.23.4. Air Force personnel appearing as necessary witnesses for a party asserting the government’s
   claim for medical care expenses are witnesses for the United States if the government’s claim is large
   enough to justify the expenditure, as determined by the responsible SJA.
   9.23.5. When Air Force personnel appear as witnesses for the United States, but the Air Force is not
   involved in the litigation, AFLSA/JACL, or JACT (in cases arising under AFI 51-501), instructs the
   unit issuing the orders on how to obtain travel reimbursement.
   9.23.6. When Air Force military personnel are under subpoena to appear as witnesses for a committee
   of the Congress, private individual, or a corporation, they do not receive any allowances for travel
   from the Air Force. The party requesting testimony arranges payment in advance.
   9.23.7. When Air Force civilian personnel employed by appropriated fund activities must testify in
   their official capacity or produce official records on behalf of a party other than the United States, the
   other party pays allowable travel expenses.
   9.23.8. Since trials are frequently postponed or canceled after a witness receives orders, a witness
   must not begin travel (except when common carrier scheduling requires it) more than 1 day before the
   date on which the witness must report to the requesting US Attorney. Similarly, witnesses may not
   take temporary duty leave immediately before testifying.
   9.23.9. Civilian employees under subpoena to testify in civilian criminal proceedings or on behalf of
   a private party in connection with any judicial proceeding to which the United States, a state, or local
   government is a party, may receive court leave per 5 U.S.C. 6322. They may not receive government
   travel expenses.
   9.23.10. Witnesses frequently receive payment (witness fee) for testifying and reimbursement for
   expenses. Air Force personnel on active duty and civilians on court leave must turn in any witness
   fees to their Accounting and Finance Office.
      9.23.10.1. They may keep any reimbursements that they receive from a court or party, unless they
      are on temporary duty and are receiving government travel expenses, in which case they must turn
      in reimbursements to their accounting and finance office.
68                                                                              AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002


Section 9D—Serving on State and Local Juries by Members of the Air Force

9.24. Terms.
     9.24.1. State. Includes the 50 United States, US Territories, the District of Columbia, and the Com-
     monwealth of Puerto Rico.
     9.24.2. Active Duty. Full-time duty in the active military service of the United States. This includes:
        9.24.2.1. Full-time training duty.
        9.24.2.2. Annual training duty.
        9.24.2.3. Active duty for training.
        9.24.2.4. Attending a service school while on active military service.
     9.24.3. Operating Forces. Forces whose primary missions are participating in and supporting combat.

9.25. Legal Authority for Exemption. Under 10 U.S.C. 982, Air Force members are exempt from jury
duty under certain circumstances. In implementing 10 U.S.C. 982, DOD Directive 5525.8, Service By
Members of the Armed Forces on State and Local Juries, June 13, 1988, paragraph 6.3. categorically
exempts all general officers, commanders, operating forces personnel in training, and personnel stationed
outside the United States from serving on a state or local jury. Also, 10 U.S.C. 982 generally exempts mil-
itary members from jury duty when:
     9.25.1. Such duty unreasonably interferes with their military duties; or
     9.25.2. Adversely affects the readiness of a unit, command, or activity to which the member is
     assigned.

9.26. Delegation of Decision Authority. The Secretary of the Air Force has delegated the authority
under 10 U.S.C. 982 to determine such exemptions to commanders. Exemption denial authority has been
delegated to immediate or higher level commanders. Exemption approval authority has been delegated to
special court-martial convening authority or higher level commanders. The approval decision of the spe-
cial court-martial convening authority acting as the designee of the Secretary is final. Additionally, notifi-
cation authority to state and local officials of exemption from jury duty pursuant to DODD 5525.8,
paragraph 6.3. has been further delegated to immediate commanders or their designees.

9.27. Procedures For Obtaining an Exemption From Jury Duty. When an Air Force member on
active duty receives a summons to state or local jury duty, the member immediately informs his or her
immediate commander.
     9.27.1. If the member is categorically exempt under DODD 5525.8, paragraph 6.3., the immediate
     commander or designee notifies the issuing state or local official.
     9.27.2. If the member is not categorically exempt under DODD 5525.8, paragraph 6.3., the immediate
     commander decides if the exemption under 10 U.S.C. 982 applies. If the immediate commander
     decides that exemption is inappropriate, the member must serve jury duty.
     9.27.3. If the immediate commander decides the 10 U.S.C. 982 exemption applies to the member, the
     immediate commander forwards a request for approval of such exemption to the special court-martial
     convening authority, who makes the decision using the statutory criteria outlined in paragraph 9.25. A
AFI51-301 20 JUNE 2002                                                                                 69


   special court-martial convening authority may request the advice and assistance of her or his servicing
   SJA in making decisions about these requests.
      9.27.3.1. The special court-martial convening authority may decide that:
          9.27.3.1.1. Exemption is inappropriate and instructs the member to comply with the jury duty
          summons.
          9.27.3.1.2. Exemption is appropriate and tells the immediate commander to send a written
          notice of the exemption to the issuing state or local official.
   9.27.4. Include these items of information in a written notice of exemption:
           "(Grade and Name), a member of the United States Air Force on active duty, has been
           summoned to perform jury duty (when, where, and on what jury). Under 10 U.S.C. 982,
           DoDD 5525.8, and Air Force Instruction 51-301, this member has been determined by the
           Secretary of the Air Force or an authorized designee as exempt from duty on the jury in
           question because such jury service would unreasonably interfere with the performance of the
           member's military duties or would adversely affect the readiness of the unit, command, or
           activity to which the member is assigned. Under 10 U.S.C. 982(b), this determination is
           conclusive."
   9.27.5. Do not charge jury duty service against leave or deduct pay or entitlements for the period of
   service.
   9.27.6. All fees to members for jury service are payable to the US Treasury.
   9.27.7. Members may receive, and keep, reimbursement from the state or local jury authority for
   expenses incurred in the performance of jury duty, such as transportation costs or parking fees.

9.28. Forms Prescribed. AF Form 44, Certificate of Records.
