     of previous departures or other flight control anomalies within last 90 days, 325
     MXG/MXQ will enter a Red Dash write-up in IMIS, Maintenance Discrepancy and
     Work Document,. The write-up will read as follows: “An instructor pilot is required to
     fly the next sortie due to a confirmed pilot induced flight control departure.” Do not
     remove write-up until flown and signed off by an instructor pilot.
  1.5. The aircraft impoundment official/FCDT chief will:

         prior to any maintenance actions.

     1.5.4. Conduct a mandatory meeting with 325 MXG/MXQ, aircrew and FCDT members.
     At this time, Flight Control Debrief Worksheet will be reviewed to determine where and
     when the aircraft will be worked.
     1.5.5. The impoundment official on a case-by-case basis may authorize maintenance that
     has no affect on or correlation to the departure.
         1.5.5.1. Ensure all IMIS entries, applicable checklists and IMDS documentation
         related to the impoundment for departure are completed prior to routing the forms to
         QA and MXG/CC (or designated representative) for forms review and impoundment
         release.
     1.5.6. (F-22) Ensure Fault Recording Codes (FRC) from the Data Transfer Cartridge
     (DTC) is downloaded.
     1.5.7. Forward an impound log update to 325 MXG/MXQ, MXG/CC, MXG/CD and
     AMXS supervision daily.
     1.5.8. Maintain contact with maintenance back shops for status of removed equipment.
     1.5.9. Ensure the aircraft malfunction is duplicated, if possible, prior to any maintenance
     or parts replacement.
     1.5.10. Ensure only a FCDT Chief signs the “Inspected By” block for flight control
     discrepancies identified as “repeat” or “recurring.”
     1.5.11. The Impoundment Official and FCDT Chief may authorize non-FCDT members
     to assist the team in changing line replacement units and other parts. However, non-
     FCDT members will not perform rigging or functional checks on any of the components.
     If it is determined by FCDT that avionics components are to be removed for bench check,
     it will be accomplished only after all other avionics checks are complied with.

2. PROCEDURES. When an aircraft experiences an uncommanded flight control malfunction,
it will be determined if the departure was pilot induced. If the aircraft departed, the aircraft will
be impounded IAW AFI 21-101. A FCDT will be formed unless otherwise deferred by the 325
MXG/CC/CD, or meets the requirements of either paragraph 1.5.1.1, 1.5.5,, or if during an FCF,
the aircraft fails roll/yaw rate checks.
     2.1. Upon notification of a possible aircraft departure, two Fighter Squadron personnel
     (limited to the CC, DO, Safety Officer, Weapons Officer or a Functional Check Flight pilot)
     will interview pilot review flight tapes to determine if a departure occurred.
        2.1.1. Based on AMU determination, OG/CC, OG/CD or OG/CC Representative will
        annotate and sign Para 6 on the Flight Control Debrief Worksheet (Attachment 2).
            2.1.1.1. No actual departure: If determined no departure occurred, the discrepancy
            will be cleared in the following manner: In the corrective action block of IMIS, the
            impoundment official will state, “Review 807 file/IMIS, as appropriate for F-22,
            confirms there was no departure per rank, name and position” and will sign the
            inspected block.
        2.1.2. Pilot induced departure (confirmed): If the departure is confirmed as pilot induced,
        the following actions are required: the discrepancy will be cleared in the following
        manner: In the corrective action block of IMIS, the impoundment official will state, “F-
        22 tape confirms the departure was pilot induced per rank, name and position” and will
        sign the inspected block.
            2.1.2.1. A FCF/OCF is not required for confirmed pilot induced departures.
        2.1.3. Aircraft uncommanded flight control malfunction/inconclusive pilot induced
        determination:
            2.1.3.1. (F-22) Perform a FLCS IBIT and AUTO RIG as a minimum.
     2.2. As a minimum, the impoundment official and FCDT chief will accompany the aircraft
     forms for forms review and impoundment release. The impoundment official will bring the
     Departure Debrief Sheet and aircraft forms with them for review and impoundment clear.

  NOTE: Complete this worksheet prior to making entries to the aircraft 781’s/IMIS.

   1. General information
     1.1.     Aircraft: _______________ Date:_______________ Time of
          Incident:_______________
     1.2.     Pilot:____________________________ Rank:_______________

   2. Definitions:
     2.1.     A departure from controlled flight is characterized by a large, uncommanded
          flight path change such as an abrupt nose slice, an abrupt roll away from lateral stick
          or excessive yaw rate.
     2.2.     An aircraft is considered out of control when it no longer responds to flight
          control inputs. For example, if the airplane enters a sustained right roll when the pilot
          attempts a nose high slow speed reversal to the left, the airplane is out of control.
     2.3.     Given these definitions (in your opinion), this incident is best described as
          __________ an out of control situation or __________ a departure from controlled
          flight.

   3. Maneuver information at the beginning of departure or loss of control.
     3.1.     maneuver being
          attempted:___________________________________________________________
