     1.7.1. Internal Users – AFSCN users assigned to 50th Space Wing (50 SW).
     1.7.2. External Users (EXU) - AFSCN user organizations that are not assigned to the 50 SW.
1.8. Inter-range Operational Number (IRON). A randomly generated unclassified four-digit
number assigned to each space vehicle, as supported in flight or pre-flight.
1.9. Products. Numerous documents are developed and distributed to support the AFSCN
mission. Requirements for various messages not detailed here are obtained from the applicable
Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) for the supporting agencies. See Chapters 2 through 4 for
development and distribution of scheduling products. The following documents are applicable to
AFSCN CUE resources:
     1.9.1. Network Tasking Order (NTO). The culmination of all phases of NTO
     development, it is the official AFSCN tasking schedule published daily in 24-hour blocks.
     The NTO identifies which AFSCN resources (range assets, communications assets, and other
     supporting assets) are assigned to each flight and non-flight activity. These tasks are
     indicated in Electronic Schedule Dissemination (ESD) by equipment mnemonics at assigned
     specific support times for each site-side. The NTO is developed through completion of three
     basic phases:
        1.9.1.1. Seven-day Forecast.
        1.9.1.2. Conflict Briefing Operations.
        1.9.1.3. Realtime period is the published Network Tasking Order (NTO).
     1.9.2. Three-month Forecast. An official notification to all AFSCN users of the intent to
     schedule an activity. The three-month forecast includes upcoming major operations and
     planned downtimes.
     1.9.3. Seven-day Forecast. Published within the seven-day Forecast phase of NTO
     development, it is a forecast of all flight and non-flight activities for the upcoming seven-day
     period. The seven-day forecast is used to establish the initial definitive tasking schedule for
     AFSCN resources and frequency control messages for the Remote Ground Facility (RGF).
50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                         9


  Maintenance as well as user Satellite Acquisition Table (SAT) and Program Action Plan
  (PAP) information is loaded to ESD for the seven-day period.
  1.9.4. Pre-Deconfliction Listing. Published within the Conflict Briefing Operations phase
  of NTO development, it identifies satellite contacts in conflict with other activities and
  provides any suggested modifications to nominal satellite configuration required to alleviate
  conflict.
  1.9.5. NTO. Published every 24 hours, it consists of:
     1.9.5.1. Conflict Briefing list which identifies AFSCN wide impacting maintenance
     downtime, Conflict Deletes, Conditional Deletes, and To Be Resolved (TBR) conflicts.
     1.9.5.2. A 24-hour schedule that identifies authorized usage of AFSCN resources which
     includes all flight (launch support, satellite contacts) and non-flight (downtime, training,
     etc.) activity.
  1.9.6. Realtime Change Message. Notification of a flight or non-flight activity change
  made to the current NTO. ESD provides realtime change notifications and tracks which
  AFSCN users and work centers have acknowledged receipt.
  1.9.7. Manning Schedule Change (MSC). AFSCN users are required to submit an MSC to
  affect or acknowledge a change to their support requirements within the seven-day and
  conflict briefing periods. This MSC provides 22 SOPS authorization from the Satellite
  Control Authority (SCA) to add a new contact or to delete or modify an existing satellite
  contact previously entered to the schedule. An MSC provides an audit trail for subsequent
  review and investigation purposes should the need arise.
  1.9.8. Downtime request. A formal request for maintenance, testing, validation, or system
  checkout that will cause a scheduled loss, limit, or risk of loss of AFSCN resources.
  1.9.9. AFSCN Outage Report. An AFSCN outage report identifies and reports an
  unscheduled loss or limitation of AFSCN resources. It is used primarily by the user and
  network scheduler personnel to mitigate risk to space missions, and by maintenance and
  logistics personnel for trending purposes.
  1.9.10. Mission Impact Report (MIR). Provides AFSCN users a process for reporting less
  than successful satellite contacts when problems encountered are suspected or known to be
  caused by AFSCN assets, or when the cause is unknown. A MIR will initiate the process for
  determining and addressing the reason for the unsuccessful support. MIRs are used to
  document anomalies, provide audit trails, and determine trending data for recurring
  problems. See Chapter 6 for MIR requirements.
  1.9.11. Ancillary Event. This product provides details of abnormal conditions of AFSCN
  assets when they are not captured by a downtime or outage report.

1.10. AFSCN Communications Network. The AFSCN communications network is designed
to provide operators the ability to create dynamic communications connections between user and
range assets. See figure 1.1. The following describes the chief elements of the AFSCN
communications network:
    1.10.1. Inter-nodal communications (INC) - a communications link between the OCNs. INC
    provides a path for contingency routing should direct communications with either node fail.
    Communications connections across the AFSCN network automatically re-route across INC
    without operator intervention.
    1.10.2. Primary communications (PRI) - the primary communications between an OCN and
    a RGF. PRI carries both Primary Secure Voice (PSV) and vehicle data.
    1.10.3. Additional communications (ADD) - the additional communications between an
    OCN and a RTS. ADD provides operators with an additional route for mission data should
    PRI fail, or the opportunity to redirect telemetry or commanding in addition to using PRI.
          1.10.3.1. Operators must explicitly connect to range resources using PRI and/or ADD.
          The AFSCN communications network is designed to keep PRI and ADD traffic separate,
          and places the onus on the operator to route operational traffic around failures or
          downtimes of either communications system.
    1.10.4. Wide Area Network Interface Unit (WANIU) - provides users the interface into the
    AFSCN communications network. User and range assets are connected to ports of a
    WANIU, so operators may create dynamic connections between those assets.
          1.10.4.1. RTS WANIU - Each RTS maintains a WANIU for Primary connectivity (PRI)
          and one for Additional connectivity (ADD).. EVCF maintains a single WANIU for PRI
          connectivity only. These WANIUs provide port connectivity for range assets, such as
          commanding, telemetry and IRIG-B signals, and port connectivity for transporting
          subsystems, such as secure voice and ESD.
          1.10.4.2. OCN WANIU - provides port connectivity for user assets at the OCNs, and
          port connectivity for transporting subsystems, such as Secure Voice and ESD.
50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                     11


       1.10.4.3. EXU (NOPS and RSC) WANIU - provides external users a direct interface into
       the AFSCN network.
       1.10.4.4. OCN WANIUs and EXU WANIUs are not restricted to PRI or ADD and route
       over the communications system as configured by the operator.
   1.10.5. Distributed Communications Controller (DCC) - the application, and the workstation
   on which it runs, that allows an operator to configure, monitor, and release communications
   resources between WANIU ports.
   1.10.6. Control and Monitor (C&M) - AFSCN communications between DCC and WANIU,
   which provides the conduit for controlling and monitoring WANIUs, WANIU ports, and the
   dynamic connections between. C&M will route around failures of PRI or ADD.
   1.10.7. AFSCN Operational Signals (AOS) - WANIU connections dynamically established
   by operators for each satellite contact.
   1.10.8. Static Connections - WANIU connections permanently maintained by the
   communications work centers in support of various subsystems and user missions. Static
   connections with an RGF traverse either PRI or ADD depending on which RTS WANIU is
   assigned.
   1.10.9. C&M, AOS, static connections, and test connections all share the same available
   bandwidth between locations. Users should be cognizant of possible limits in available
   bandwidth when establishing AOS. ADD typically provides less throughput, or bandwidth,
   for mission data than PRI.

                                REAL TIME OPERATIONS

2.1. Real Time Operations. The period from now until the end of the latest published NTO.
ESD servers and workstations continuously display the end time of the latest published NTO
known as the Real Time Boundary. Network Scheduling responds to all realtime changes
necessitated by SCA requirements, outage conditions, or satellite anomalies.
2.2. Policy:
   2.2.1. All AFSCN users, RGFs, and supporting agencies will adhere to the NTO.
   2.2.2. The 22 SOPS NOC maintains operational command and control over AFSCN
   resources.
       2.2.2.1. Any modification to the NTO that increases network tasking (i.e., early radiation
       requests, contact adds or extensions, including additional resources) must be coordinated
       with and approved by Network Scheduling prior to the action being taken.
       2.2.2.2. The conflict resolution process is used for both planned (Conflict Briefing
       period) and unplanned (Realtime) conflict situations. If a conflict involves two
       requirements from within the same agency, it will be resolved internally by the agency,
       and the final solution provided to Network Scheduling. When a conflict involves
       separate agencies, scheduling will make every effort to resolve the conflict based on
       existing priorities within attachment 2, the approved classified priority matrix and any
       other dynamics involved. If unresolved this conflict becomes a TBR and is presented to
       the NCMDR/NCCH at least two hours prior to the start of the pre-pass for the earliest
       requested satellite contact in conflict. The NCMDR/ NCCH will make the final decision
       and pass results to Network Scheduling at least 30 minutes prior to the start of the pre-
       pass for the earliest requested satellite contact in conflict.
       2.2.2.3. The recognized Satellite Control Authority (SCA) for a vehicle is the only
       agency that may request changes to a flight activity, unless they have previously
       authorized and coordinated with 22 SOPS for another agency to do so.
       2.2.2.4. AFSCN users may submit an MSC when a block change is required and is pre-
       coordinated with Network Scheduling. Scheduling will deconflict/coordinate as required
       to incorporate the requested changes.
       2.2.2.5. AFSCN users are authorized to access AFSCN resources from the first second of
       start of prepass as scheduled on the NTO, and must release resources prior to the first
       second of the stop time listed on the NTO.
   2.2.3. Network Scheduling is the approval agency for all RTS free-space radiation requests.
       2.2.3.1. An RTS need not radiate during the entire block of time authorized on the NTO,
       but an RTS may not radiate outside of the authorized radiate times.
   2.2.4. Non-flight activities requiring AFSCN CUE must be accomplished during the time
   specified on the NTO. The times that appear on the NTO are to be used for activity specified
14                                                              50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013


  in the schedule, and are not to be used for other purposes without prior coordination and
  approval.
  2.2.5. Use secure communications whenever possible. When secure communications are not
  available, all parties will use appropriate call-back procedures.
  2.2.6. Network Scheduling will notify all affected AFSCN users and work centers of
  changes to the NTO via ESD realtime change notifications or by voice when ESD is not
  available.
     2.2.6.1. AFSCN users and work centers will acknowledge ESD change notifications
     upon receipt.
     2.2.6.2. Network Scheduling will contact, by voice, any affected AFSCN users or work
     centers who have not acknowledged an ESD change notification when the start time is
     within two hours.
  2.2.7. Network Scheduling will use the AFSCN Satellite Contact Priority List in Attachment
  2 when approving, coordinating and processing adds, deletes, or modifications to the
  published NTO, and coordinate with the NCMDR/NCCH to provide resource allocation
  direction when established priority guidelines fail to resolve conflicts.
     2.2.7.1. A classified Priority Matrix is available to the NCMDR/NCCH/NSCH to further
     clarify mission priority.
  2.2.8. When a vehicle anomaly occurs, the impacted AFSCN user will immediately contact
  Network Scheduling and declare the appropriate satellite contact priority, using the AFSCN
  Satellite Contact Priority List available in Attachment 2.
  2.2.9. AFSCN users and work centers will notify Network Scheduling of early termination
  of scheduled activities when there is a scheduled short turnaround to (TAT) the next
  scheduled activity or the activity is terminated early by five or more minutes.
  2.2.10. Outage Conditions: See 50SWI 10-224 for outage responsibilities
     2.2.10.1. Network Scheduling will contact those users adversely impacted by an outage
     condition to determine contact support alternatives.
     2.2.10.2. Network Scheduling will not alter any flight activity in the NTO that cannot be
     supported due to an outage condition, unless the affected AFSCN user authorizes a
     deletion, limitation or a move of the impacted activity.
     2.2.10.3. If a problem occurs during a satellite contact, the affected AFSCN user will
     immediately alert all personnel on the net supporting the satellite contact.
         2.2.10.3.1. All alerted personnel will in return provide the status of equipment at
         their location.
         2.2.10.3.2. The AFSCN user will report any mission impact IAW the MIR process
         (Chapter 6) and include in the report the statuses provided by each location.
  2.2.11. NOC Override:
50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                        15


     2.2.11.1. 22 SOPS will develop, distribute, enforce and maintain NOC Override
     procedures designed to quickly and efficiently enhance AFSCN access and enforce the
     NTO.
     2.2.11.2. The NCMDR/NCCH will use the NOC override function to ensure the
     Network Tasking Order is strictly adhered to.
     2.2.11.3. In the event of a request for a NOC Override, resources will not be released
     without confirmation of offending vehicle safing from the user. LEO supports that are
     more than 2 minutes beyond visibility fade will be released with no contact to the user.
  2.2.12. Non-flight Activities. Network Scheduling will notify AFSCN users via ESD of any
  changes to downtimes that impact user required network resources.
     2.2.12.1. The AFSCN work center responsible for a downtime will assess the status of
     the downtime at 30 minutes before the expiration of the scheduled downtime.
     2.2.12.2. If the assessment indicates operational capability will not be restored by the end
     of the downtime, contact Network Scheduling and attempt to extend the downtime.
     2.2.12.3. If the downtime cannot be extended without approval of Scheduling through
     coordination with an impacted user, the responsible work center will open an appropriate
     category outage within 10 minutes of the extension being denied.
  2.2.13. AFSCN Overloading and Optimization:
     2.2.13.1. Contingencies may occur that could cause overloading of available AFSCN
     resources. When conflicts present severe AFSCN mission impact, based on feedback
     from AFSCN users and work centers, or more than four Lost supports and/or Conflict
     Deletes occur in a six-hour period, the 22 SOPS NOC will consider taking the following
     steps to increase AFSCN availability:
         2.2.13.1.1. Delete proficiency training.
         2.2.13.1.2. Delete RTS maintenance activities on a case-by-case basis.
         2.2.13.1.3. Continue to monitor MIRs and user feedback.
     2.2.13.2. If training and maintenance have been reduced and on-orbit satellite contact
     activities are still impacted, Network Scheduling will conduct the following Level l to 4
     reductions (sequentially) until the NCMDR/NCCH determines Lost supports and/or
     Conflict Deletes are reduced to an acceptable level:
         2.2.13.2.1. Level 1 reduction - Delete exercise and network testing sorties.
         2.2.13.2.2. Level 2 reduction - Maximize use of dedicated program resources.
         Consider reducing maintenance activity on the network.
         2.2.13.2.3. Level 3 reduction - Cancel non-mission impacting on-orbit testing and
         monitoring/ tracking sorties.
         2.2.13.2.4. Level 4 reduction - Eliminate lower priority sorties per Priority Matrix
         located in Attachment 2.
     2.2.13.3. In the event that National Readiness is elevated, directives contained in the
     applicable 22 SOPS checklist will be followed.
 16                                                                  50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013

                            CONFLICT BRIEFING OPERATIONS

3.1. Daily Conflict Resolution Process. The daily conflict resolution process allocates AFSCN
resources to an activity with the highest priority for a particular time and site. Resultant products
include the NTO and the Daily Conflict Brief Listing which contains notifications to AFSCN
users of specific conflicts which result in Conflict Deletes, Conditional Deletes, TBR conflicts,
and downtimes that may impact multiple sites.
   3.1.1. During this period all conflicts are identified and potential resolutions are presented to
   users in an attempt to minimize conflicts and ensure satellite operator mission success.
   During the conflict resolution process, all conflicts or imposed limitations are discussed and
   resolved at the lowest possible level commensurate with responsibility, authority, and
   available guidance.
       3.1.1.1. This process is completed daily between the hours of 0000z – 1000z. During this
       process satellite PAP requirements will be strictly maintained.
   3.1.2. MSCs will be submitted via ESD by users to effect and finalize any change to an
   existing contact or to add a new contact. Submit MSCs in the following format:
       3.1.2.1. Date/Time (Z) - the date and time of a single support, or the time span
       encompassing several supports, which the requested change affects.
       3.1.2.2. Site - Enter the site with “X” (i.e., BOSS-X) if either side may be used for this
       support, or the specific site and side if support must be run on a particular antenna. Use
       ANY for a request that impacts several supports (e.g., add ARSS) or when specific
       site/side is not required.
       3.1.2.3. IRON - the IRON of the affected satellite contact. Use ANY for a line that
       impacts all contacts owned by the user within a stated period of time and/or on a stated
       Site/Side.
       3.1.2.4. Rev - the specific revolution of the satellite contact. Use ANY when the change
       impacts several supports (ensure Date/Time or Site/Side encompasses the desired support
       contacts).
       3.1.2.5. Func - the ESD function of this request.
       3.1.2.6. (Blank) heading - “A” when adding a satellite contact, “M” when modifying an
       existing satellite contact, or “D” when deleting a satellite contact.
       3.1.2.7. Comments - any clarifying comments to be included within the comments field
       of the impacted supports, or other additional information.
           3.1.2.7.1. For any negotiated resolution with less than nominal requirements, the
           AFSCN user should state what deviations were accepted (e.g. short turnaround,
           substituted equipment, etc.)
           3.1.2.7.2. For deleted satellite contacts, the AFSCN user will include if the deletion is
           a Conflict or Program Delete. If the type of deletion is not specified, Network
           Scheduling will categorize it as a Program Delete.
50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                            21


       3.1.2.8. Reason for Change - a description of reason for the change.
3.2. Conflict Period. The 24-hour time period, 1600Z to 1600Z daily, that is being prepped for
publication as the next NTO.
   3.2.1. This is the forecast period for which Network Schedulers, AFSCN users, and other
   AFSCN work centers, resolve any remaining conflicts between program requests, scheduled
   downtimes, and other non-flight activities.
   3.2.2. Users are notified of potential intra-AFSCN radio frequency interference and
   downtimes that may impact the entire AFSCN.
3.3. Conflict Delete. Those satellite contacts which cannot be scheduled due to limited
resources, and cannot be fulfilled elsewhere, resulting in the loss of mission data are identified as
Conflict Deletes. Conflict Deletes are documented on the Daily Conflict Briefing Listing.
3.4. Conditional Delete. Used by Network Scheduling in conjunction with a launch or
downtime to indicate the Realtime disposition of each satellite contact impacted by a potential
launch slip or potential completion time of a downtime. Conditional Deletes are listed on the
Daily Conflict Briefing Listing.
   3.4.1. Substantiating documentation, by MSC, from the AFSCN user must include all details
   and will contain all agreed upon conditions including a time tag delineating when the
   conditions are to be executed. The text of the conditional resolution, when practical, will be
   identical to the Conflict MSC, the Conflict Briefing Listing, and the NTO.
3.5. Program Delete - label assigned to a contact request from an AFSCN user withdrawn
due to internal requirements, program requirements met with alternative satellite contacts,
and so on.
   3.5.1. Program Deletes are similar to Conflict Deletes, but are used when the satellite contact
   can be deleted (due to satellite contact requirements being reduced, dropped, or fulfilled
   elsewhere) without loss of mission data. Program Deletes do not appear on the Conflict
   Briefing Listing.
3.6. To Be Resolved (TBR). A conflict that cannot be resolved through normal processes prior
to being placed in the Real Time schedule becomes a TBR issue and forwarded to the
NCMDR/NCCH for resolution.
3.7. Pre-Deconfliction Listing. Published every day by 1100z, this output lists the satellite
contacts requested by the Mission Command Center (MCC)/ Space Operations Center (SOC)
and annotates those satellite contacts with conflicts (e.g. sun RFI, launches) or contact limitations
imposed by resource availability issues.
3.8. Frequency Control and Analysis Center (FCAC): The FCAC is a Western Range Asset
and is not part of the 50SW. They provide frequency control and analysis functions for the
launch agency within 30SW. They will:
   3.8.1. Resolve EMI/RFI conflicts to provide EMI/RFI protection to AFSCN satellites from
   various Western Range activities.
   3.8.2. Coordinate through the RTS and inform Network Scheduling when protection from
   launch pad EMI/RFI cannot be provided to AFSCN satellites.
 22                                                                  50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013


   3.8.3. Inform Network Scheduling when RF restrictions are placed on Vandenberg Tracking
   Station to protect payloads on the Western Range.
3.9. Network Scheduling will:
   3.9.1. Load Data Entry FormaT (DEFT) files.
   3.9.2. Minimize conflicts while remaining within users stated requirements as much as
   possible.
   3.9.3. Offer workable solutions outside of user’s requirements to aid in conflict resolution.
   3.9.4. Publish the Pre-Deconfliction listing.
   3.9.5. Coordinate conflict resolution with involved users.
   3.9.6. Prepare and publish the Daily Conflict Briefing Listing.
3.10. AFSCN Users will:
   3.10.1. Review impacts to satellite contact requirements published in the Pre-Deconfliction
   Listing and resolve conflicts IAW this chapter.
   3.10.2. Complete conflict resolution negotiation with, and submit MSCs to, Network
   Scheduling NLT 1100Z.
   3.10.3. Include specific details of conflict resolution (including Conditional Deletes) on the
   MSC. Submit an MSC via ESD. If ESD is not available, submit a hard copy via fax, contact
   Network Scheduling by phone to notify them of the faxed document.
   3.10.4. Ensure personnel with proper authority to resolve conflicts are available 24/7, or
   make arrangements for conflict resolution with 22 SOPS for any period the user is not
   available.
   3.10.5. When applicable, submit 24 hour DEFTs by 0200Z daily.
   3.10.6. Complete deconfliction by 1700z daily and submit MSCs by 1800z daily.
3.11. 22 SOPS Orbital Analysis will:
   3.11.1. Provide SRFI and RFI data to Network Scheduling.
3.12. 22 SOPS Mission Planning will:
   3.12.1. Respond to Network Scheduling on identified conflicts involving protected
   downtimes and Network Freeze impacts.
   3.12.2. Negotiate conflict resolutions that impact downtimes.
3.13. Procedures:
   3.13.1. The daily Conflict Briefing period must include all known requirements. Users are
   responsible for submitting new or changed requirements via MSC. Network Scheduling
   personnel will incorporate new and/or modified requirements into the daily Conflict Briefing
   period.
      3.13.1.1. Network Scheduling will optimize the conflict period and identify resultant
      conflicts and limitations. During this process, satellite Program Action Plan (PAP)
      requirements will be strictly observed.
50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                         23


       3.13.1.2. To aid in optimization, each satellite contact is assigned a satellite contact
       priority by the MCC/SOC responsible for the satellite contact based on the nature of the
       mission being supported (see Att. 2 for AFSCN Satellite Contact Priority List).
       3.13.1.3. Network Scheduling may suggest modifications to original support
       requirements in order to gain conflict resolution.
   3.13.2. The conflict resolution process begins when the pre-deconfliction listing is published
   at 1100Z. This listing contains all requested satellite contacts for the period of the next NTO
   and identifies supports in conflict, supports with reduced nominal equipment, supports with
   a reduced prepass from its nominal and scheduler suggested modifications intended to avoid
   stated conflicts.
       3.13.2.1. Users will coordinate with Network Scheduling to ensure conflict resolution is
       achieved NLT 1700Z daily.
       3.13.2.2. Conflict resolution is achieved when a decision has been made concerning who
       will receive the resource, or acceptance of a limitation is agreed upon, and MSCs have
       been received by Network Scheduling confirming all changes to requested satellite
       contacts.
   3.13.3. If a conflict cannot be resolved, it will be published on the NTO as a TBR conflict
   and forwarded to the NCMDR/NCCH for further evaluation and resolution. The
   NCMDR/NCCH may be requested to engage at any time during the conflict resolution period
   in order to resolve a conflict.
3.14. Submit MSCs to Network Scheduling for modifications, adds and deletes within the
seven-day and conflict briefing periods via ESD. An MSC provides an audit trail for later
review and investigation purposes should the need arise.
   3.14.1. For any negotiated resolution with less than nominal requirements, the MCC/SOC
   shall state what deviations were accepted (e.g. short turnaround, substituted equipment, etc.)
   for each support.
3.15. For deleted satellite contacts- Network Scheduling will assume a Program delete is
appropriate unless otherwise specified on the user MSC.
3.16. The conflict resolution process ends when the de-conflicted period is published as the
latest NTO- with its associated Conflict Brief Listing when required.
 24                                                                 50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013


                                           Chapter 4

                                 SEVEN-DAY OPERATIONS

4.1. Policy. The seven day period beginning on the next Monday at 0000Z, this is the forecast
period for which Network Schedulers load vehicle acquisition data, program requests, and non-
flight activities into ESD.
   4.1.1. The seven-day Forecast provides valuable non-flight allocation information to the
   users. Satellite contacts and non-flight activities are bulk loaded into the ESD database.
   Inputs for generation of the seven-day Forecast fall into two major categories. These
   categories are Satellite Acquisition Tables (SATs) and Program Action Plans (PAPs).
   4.1.2. If several changes to a previously submitted PAP are required within a seven day
   period, Network Scheduling may request a new PAP and/or SAT in lieu of an MSC.
4.2. Seven-day Forecast. This forecast is published every Thursday at 2200Z and takes effect
the following Monday at 0000Z. The published seven-day Forecast spans the seven-day period
from Mon 0000Z to Mon 0000Z and combines user SAT and PAP data with the seven-day
Maintenance Forecast into a single product. The product is used by user and scheduler personnel
to forecast potential conflicts with major vehicle events and planned maintenance.
4.3. Frequency Control Message. Provided for GTS, HTS and VTS use for launch and aircraft
radio frequency deconfliction.
4.4. SAT Data. Normally electronically submitted via ESD, SAT data is used to populate the
scheduling database with vehicle visibilities. Submission of acquisition data varies with the type
of orbit.
4.5. PAP Data. Normally electronically submitted via ESD, PAPs are profiles used by various
MCCs/SOCs to identify their satellite contact requirements. Once the PAP has been loaded into
the ESD database, any changes to user requirements must be accomplished by submitting an
MSC. Agencies submitting paper PAPs shall ensure all entries are clear, in time sequence and
do not contain crossed out information.
4.6. Network Scheduling will:
   4.6.1. Ensure the latest acquisition (SAT) data and its associated PAP are on hand and
   loaded into the ESD database prior to publishing the seven-day Forecast.
   4.6.2. Publish the seven-day Forecast every Thursday NLT 2200Z.
4.7. AFSCN User will:
   4.7.1. Submit acquisition data to Network Scheduling. Updates to acquisition data will be
   submitted to Network Scheduling whenever acquisition times change.
   4.7.2. Submit accurate satellite contact requirements via PAP no later than 2000Z Tuesday,
   six days prior to the effective seven-day forecast. Submit satellite acquisition data to 22
   SOPS/DOUA for new vehicle or launch no later than Tuesday, thirteen days prior to the date
   of the effective seven-day forecast.
   4.7.3. Submit satellite positional data to 22 SOPS/DOUA in accordance with ICD-509.
   Additional SAT inputs are provided as needed for maneuvers and orbital updates.
50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                          25


   4.7.4. Participate in the weekly downtime meeting (either by attendance or teleconference)
   conducted every Friday by 22 SOPS Mission Planning.

      impacted by forecast downtimes.
      4.7.4.2. Participate in conflict resolution when potential impacts to critical operations are
      identified.
   4.7.5. Provide orbit track data to RTS or 22 SOPS Orbital Analysis for entry into the
   NORAD Element Data Set (NEDS).
4.8. RTS will:
   4.8.1. Provide forecast downtimes to 22 SOPS Mission Planning NLT Tuesday at 1600
   (Mountain Time) six days prior to the effective seven-day forecast.
   4.8.2. Submit requests or changes to non-flight activities to 22 SOPS/MAO during 22 SOPS
   normal duty hours, Monday through Friday or to Network Scheduling after normal duty
   hours and on weekends or holidays

   stations.
   4.9.2. Submit 14 days of acquisition data via SAT on TUESDAY and FRIDAY by 2200z
   prior to the date of the effective seven-day forecast. Friday's delivery only consists of 2SWS
   and all low flyers. Additional SAT inputs are provided as needed for maneuvers and orbital
   updates.
   4.9.3. Provide Predictive Radio Frequency Interference (PRFI) report to Network
   Scheduling at least once per week.
   4.9.4. Provide Predictive Sun RFI report to Network Scheduling at least once per week
   during the seasonal equinoxes for primary and additional AFSCN communication links.
4.10. 22 SOPS Mission Planning will:
   4.10.1. Process and ensure the accuracy of non-flight requirements.
   4.10.2. Enter non-flight seven-day requirements into the ESD database by 2000Z Thursday
   of each week.
   4.10.3. Ensure the seven-day non-flight activities in NTO are reviewed for accuracy and also
   to ensure there is no AFSCN SYSCAP impact below an amber rating for this period.
 26                                                                 50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013


                                           Chapter 5

                               CERTIFICATE TO OPERATE

5.1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for AFSCN users to
demonstrate to 22 SOPS their proficiency in the use of DCC workstations to configure and
deconfigure AFSCN resources and their understanding of policy surrounding the NOC Override
function. Paragraphs 5.2 through 5.4 do not apply to existing authorized users. Paragraph 5.5
applies to all users of the AFSCN.
5.2. Certification to Operate (CTO). Organizations new to the AFSCN are required to certify
through a “train the trainer” approach prior to using the AFSCN communications resources.
   5.2.1. Demonstrated proficiency is a prerequisite for users to obtain a CTO.
   5.2.2. The 22 SOPS/CC or 22 SOPS/DO is the approval authority for CTO.
   5.2.3. All activities and organizations using AFSCN resources are required to meet this
   policy.
   5.2.4. CTO must be completed NLT 30 days prior to launch, assumption of program
   responsibility, or any operations using AFSCN resources.
   5.2.5. In the event a user cannot meet these requirements due to configuration or other
   justifiable limitations, a waiver may be requested.
       5.2.5.1. Request for a waiver must be submitted to 22 SOPS/CC through 22 SOPS/DOK.
       The request should explain the reasons the user cannot meet the requirements outlined in
       this chapter, provide possible workarounds to ensure no negative impact to the network,
       and provide any possible get well dates for documented deficiencies.
5.3. Certification Process. 22 SOPS/DOK manages and administers the CTO program.
   5.3.1. 22 SOPS/DOK will observe the performance of the organization trainer (SME) while
   they are responding to the proficiency tasks identified below. 22 SOPS/DOK will monitor
   and assess training and certification supports from the 22 SOPS NOC and ensure that the
   user understands NOC Override purpose, process and requirements.
   5.3.2. The SME is required to successfully complete five monitored proficiency tasks prior
   to certification.
   5.3.3. Upon successful completion of the CTO process, the organization trainer will in turn
   certify operators within his or her organization.
5.4. Proficiency Tasks. This section details the tasks for which a user must demonstrate
proficiency. During the training satellite contacts, the SME will:
   5.4.1. Acquire all required resources within 30 seconds of being given the direction to
   acquire, Set Asynchronous Response Mode (SARM) and release all resources after the
   SARM within 15 seconds of being given the direction to release.
   5.4.2. Successfully request a NOC override of currently configured resources. The SME
   will state which RGF site-side requires a release of resources, what time to release resources,
   and confirm their vehicle is safed.
50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                       27


   5.4.3. Release resources within 15 seconds of receiving a call, prior to the scheduled fade
   time of the support, from 22 SOPS ordering an immediate release of resources.
5.5. Decertification Process. 22 SOPS/DO oversees the decertification process.
   5.5.1. A user organization that accumulates three or more Personnel Errors (PEs) within a
   30-day period, which resulted in a NOC override of user resources, will be issued a warning
   by the 22 SOPS/DO.
   5.5.2. If a user organization receives two warnings within a 30 day period from the 22
   SOPS/DO, or upon 22 SOPS/DO discretion, the user will be directed to recertify IAW with
   section 5.3 of this chapter. Only mission essential operations will be allowed until the user
   organization completes recertification.
 28                                                                50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013


                                          Chapter 6

                         MISSION IMPACT REPORTING (MIR)

6.1. Purpose. MIRs provide AFSCN users a process for reporting less than successful satellite
contacts when problems encountered are suspected or known to be caused by AFSCN assets. A
MIR will initiate the process for determining and addressing the reason for the unsuccessful
support. MIRs are used to document anomalies, provide audit trails, and determine trending data
for recurring problems. MIRs help identify scheduling discrepancies, procedural issues, and
possible outage conditions. Continue to submit MIRs after an outage has been opened at the
RTS.
6.2. AFSCN user will:
   6.2.1. Gather as much information as is available and attempt to identify the cause of a
   problem as soon as it is detected. If the problem occurs during a satellite contact, the user
   will alert all personnel supporting the satellite contact and gather the status of supporting
   equipment.
   6.2.2. Notify the supporting RGF of any satellite contact scored lost, failed, or marginal,
   either in post-pass or after determining a satellite contact was scored other than nominal.
   6.2.3. Submit a MIR to the 50 NOG CFP for any satellite contact scored lost, failed, or
   marginal within 1 hour of determination.
       6.2.3.1. Lost Satellite Contact - Problems were encountered during the satellite contact
       that resulted in not meeting all mission objectives defined by operational directives or
       pre-established by the unit and the user was impacted.
       6.2.3.2. Failed Satellite Contact - Problems were encountered during the satellite contact
       resulting in the failure to meet all planned mission objectives of the satellite contact
       defined by operational directives or pre-established by the unit, but the user was not
       impacted.
       6.2.3.3. Marginal Satellite Contact - Problems were encountered during the satellite
       contact but all mission objectives were met and the user was not impacted.
       6.2.3.4. Submit MIRs to the CFP by calling DSN 560-2666, commercial (719) 567-2666
       or via ESD using the format provided by ESD. Fax unclassified MIRs to DSN 560-6406
       or commercial (719) 567-6406.
          6.2.3.4.1. Submit classified MIRs by calling DSN 560-4305 from a STE capable
          phone. Each SOC and AFSCN External User will classify the completed MIR
          according to their unit’s Security Classification Guide and provide appropriate
          declassification instructions.
6.3. 50 SCS/CFP will:
   6.3.1. Collect, investigate, and archive MIRs.
   6.3.2. Notify the NCMDR/NCCH of potential system or range outage conditions.
   6.3.3. Notify 21 SOPS comm control of potential communications outage conditions.
50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                     29


6.4. NCMDR/NCCH
   6.4.1. Investigate reported anomalies, perform real time trend analysis and determine if a
   system outage condition exists.
   6.4.2. Coordinate real time trend analysis investigation with appropriate agencies as
   required, i.e. Comm. Control or CFP.
6.5. 21 SOPS Comm Control will -investigate reported anomalies and determine if a
communications outage condition exists.
6.6. RTS will track reported anomalies and determine if a range outage condition exists.
 30                                                                  50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013


                                            Chapter 7

                           FREE SPACE RADIATION REQUEST

7.1. Policy. 22 SOPS Network Operations Scheduling is the approval agency for all RTS free
space radiation requests and any user request for early radiation. RTS and AFSCN users will not
radiate beyond those times approved on the NTO without authorization from Network
Scheduling.
7.2. Network Scheduling will:
   7.2.1. Be the granting authority for all AFSCN radiation requests.
   7.2.2. Perform an interference analysis on each request to determine which AFSCN satellites
   may be at risk with frequencies requested during the radiation period.
   7.2.3. Contact potentially impacted users to determine impact to their space vehicle(s).
   7.2.4. Deny or modify the request for the following reasons:
       7.2.4.1. When users deny the radiation request due to risk to their vehicle.
       7.2.4.2. In the absence of user input, if a satellite using the same frequency(s) is visible,
       or a LEO within 5 minutes of rise or fade, at the requesting RTS.
   7.2.5. If the requested radiation times/ channels can be modified to eliminate risk to
   impacted users, coordinate changes with the requesting RTS and any impacted users and
   enter the granted request. Scheduling may approve a different antenna direction, command
   type based on user concurrence, or the use of an open channel to eliminate possible
   interference.
   7.2.6. Grant the request only when it is clearly evident that a need to radiate exists, and only
   when the radiation time will not conflict with any other AFSCN operation.
   7.2.7. Ensure the approved RTS free space radiation request appears on the NTO.
7.3. RTS will:
   7.3.1. Verbally submit antenna radiation (free space) request to Network Scheduling.
   7.3.2. Submit a new free space radiation request if any deviation from the original request is
   necessary.
50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                          31


                                           Chapter 8

                                  LAUNCH OPERATIONS

8.1. Description. 22 SOPS is responsible for the planning, coordination, resolution, allocation,
status, and tasking of AFSCN resources deemed necessary for launch and early-orbit operations,
and ensuring the AFSCN is properly dispositioned when executing a launch.
   8.1.1. Launch operations supported by the Network will be afforded a Priority 4 for a time
   period of launch +6 hours for High Earth Orbit (HEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)
   vehicles and launch +6 revs for all Low Earth Orbit (LEO) vehicles. However, this priority
   does not apply to booster or upper-stage support after spacecraft separation.
       8.1.1.1. Major orbit transfer maneuvers and satellite contacts necessary for the collection
       of critical attitude data required to accomplish those transfer maneuvers, as well as
       critical first acquisition of sun/earth/stars and critical initial deployments (solar wings,
       antennas, etc) will also be granted a launch priority of 4.
   8.1.2. Guidance for Operations Requirement Letter (ORL) and Freeze message input and
   timelines is contained within 50SWI 101208, Launch Readiness and Responsibilities.
   8.1.3. Slip Windows. Slip windows are a scheduling tool only and represent the window for
   launch vice an actual launch time. This allows potential conflicts to be identified and
   resolved while allowing satellite contacts to be scheduled as Conditional Deletes against the
   launch profile. Users agree to terms of support based on potential launch status during
   deconfliction. If the launch goes as planned, users in conflict will be deleted based on their
   previous acceptance of the Conditional Delete. If the launch does not impact the contact due
   to slipping 24 hours or, in the case of a contact in conflict with the slip window only,
   launching on time, the contact can be supported as scheduled.
   8.1.4. Network Freeze. A Network freeze ensures ECP (Engineering Change Proposal),
   TCM (Test Case Modification), TCC (Temporary Change Configuration), and routine
   maintenance activities remain static and CUE/RTS configurations are not modified until after
   launch or critical flight activities are completed. Non-interference basis (NIB) maintenance
   activities are not addressed.         Reference 50 SWI 10-1208, Launch Readiness and
   Responsibilities for further guidance.
8.2. Launch Readiness and Responsibilities. In addition to the below requirements, all launch
agencies utilizing the AFSCN for support will perform requirements outlined in 50 SWI 101208,
Launch Readiness and Responsibilities.
8.3. Network Scheduling will:
   8.3.1. Input launch requests into ESD when electronic PAP is received.
   8.3.2. Refuse and return user PAP submissions that display several errors, contain incorrect

                                         DOWNTIMES

9.1. Policy. 22 SOPS is the final authority for the placement of requested downtime into the
NTO. This chapter provides direction on requesting resource downtime for maintenance and
testing of, or training on, AFSCN resources.
9.2. Downtime. A downtime is a scheduled loss, limit, or risk of loss, of an AFSCN resource or
resources.
   9.2.1. An AFSCN resource will not be voluntarily removed from service without an
   approved, scheduled downtime within the NTO, or the requestor has verbal authority from
   22 SOPS scheduling.
9.3. NCMDR/NCCH will process real time request for Depot level maintenance.
9.4. Network Scheduling will:
   9.4.1. Process downtime requests appropriately.
   9.4.2. Notify all impacted parties of any limitations.
9.5. 22 SOPS Mission Planning will:
   9.5.1. Coordinate downtime requests that fall within all but the realtime and conflict briefing
   periods.
   9.5.2. Track all downtime requests.
   9.5.3. Process routine requests for downtime.
   9.5.4. Load all approved Modification Control Board (MCB) and properly coordinated
   downtimes into the seven-day forecast period.
   9.5.5. Notify Network Scheduling when all requested downtimes for a given seven-day
   period are loaded into that period.
   9.5.6. Conduct a weekly downtime meeting on Friday at 1600Z to discuss possible
   operational conflicts with the seven-day forecast.
   9.5.7. Inform all users of upcoming scheduled downtime maintenances that impact mission
   requirements through publication and distribution of the 3 month and THURLIST reports.
9.6. Requesting work center will:
   9.6.1. Request downtime for any effort that will impact or risk AFSCN resources.
9.7. Process: Downtime requests are submitted via ESD to the 22 SOPS NOC. The following
paragraphs detail the content.
   9.7.1. Downtime request information is indexed into a nine line format. A downtime request
   is commonly referred to as a “Nine-Line”.
   9.7.2. Downtime requests will identify specific equipment impacted, or potentially impacted,
   by the intended action and clearly identify possible impacts to AFSCN users.
50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                       35


9.8. Complete the Downtime Request (Nine-Line subject).
   9.8.1. A downtime request will be identified as one of the following. Enter the correct
   description into the Subject line of the Nine-Line request:
      9.8.1.1. Routine. A routine downtime request is used for any downtime that falls within
      or later than the current seven-day period. This request is processed and tracked by 22
      SOPS Mission Planning.
      9.8.1.2. Pre-coordinated. A pre-coordinated downtime request is a follow-up to a voice
      authorized downtime request whereby a hard copy downtime request is still required for
      documentation and tracking.
      9.8.1.3. Realtime. A realtime downtime request is used for any downtime required that
      falls within the already published NTO. A realtime downtime request is processed by
      Network Scheduling.
      9.8.1.4. Urgent. An urgent downtime request is submitted for efforts to resolve outage
      conditions when the maintenance action required will further impact AFSCN operations.
      This request is processed and tracked by 22 SOPS Mission Planning should it fall beyond
      deconfliction, or by Network Scheduling if it should fall within the deconfliction period.
   9.8.2. Line 1 - Job Number (required entry). The three-digit serially assigned number
   preceded by a letter prefix that identifies the requesting work center. This downtime number
   appears in the NTO for a non-flight activity in place of an IRON. A record of the three-digit
   numbers used should be maintained by the requesting work center in accordance with locally
   published procedures. Attachment 4 provides a list of downtime number prefixes. Numbers
   range from 001 to 999, with 901 to 999 normally reserved for specific purposes and 001 thru
   900 used sequentially as new requirements arise.
   9.8.3. Line 2 - Place Work Will Be Performed (required entry). Enter UNDISCLOSED if the
   location is unavailable or classified.

   (Time Specific) when the start time must remain stationary. Include any window for the
   downtime in the comments section below.
   9.8.6. Line 4, part b - Advanced Notice (required entry). This is the advance notice the
   requesting work center requires prior to the beginning of the downtime. Typically is “None”.
   9.8.7. Line 5 - Equipment (required entry). Identify impacted AFSCN resources. This
   information should match as closely as possible to the resource as it normally appears in the
   NTO.
   9.8.8. Line 6 - Office/Contact/Extension (required entry). The contact information for the
   requesting work center.
   9.8.9. Line 7 - Shift/Limitation (required entry). Enter any shift limitations for which the
   activity will be performed. i.e., “DAYSHIFT ONLY” or “WEEKDAY”, enter “NONE”
   when there is no limitation.
 36                                                              50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013


   9.8.10. Line 8, part a - Requested (required entry). The total time requested (desired) to
   accomplish this downtime activity.
   9.8.11. Line 8, part b - Required (required entry). This is the minimum amount of time

50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                      37


                                         Chapter 10

                   DISA AUTHORIZED SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS

10.1. Purpose. This chapter outlines responsibilities for managing DISA Authorized Service
Interruptions (ASI) and it provides a process to minimize disruption to AFSCN operations due to
a DISA ASI or Demand Maintenance.
10.2. DISA ASI. DISA provides the majority of the communications services for the AFSCN
communications network. Whenever a DISA facility has to interrupt service for maintenance or
any other activity, they use the process of notification described in DISAC 310-70-1, DII
Technical Control. The process includes notifying the circuit actions functions of 50 SCS CFP
and 21 SOPS PTF when an ASI will impact AFSCN services.
10.3. Demand Maintenance. A priority maintenance activity in which DISA may seize
AFSCN communications services with no notification to, or concurrence from, AFSCN
personnel.
10.4. 50 SCS TCF and 21 SOPS PTF will:
   10.4.1. Ensure DISA ASI requests that impact AFSCN services are forwarded to 21 SOPS
   comm control.
   10.4.2. Ensure AFSCN concur/non-concur for an ASI reaches appropriate requesting DISA
   facility.
   10.4.3. Ensure 21 SOPS comm control receives notification of any conflict with a non-
   concur response.
   10.4.4. Develop local procedures in coordination with 21 SOPS comm control and 22 SOPS
   NOC to ensure efficient and timely execution of these requirements.
   10.4.5. Investigate and resolve any failure to be notified of an ASI that impacts AFSCN
   services.
10.5. 21 SOPS Comm Control will:
   10.5.1. Determine ASI impact to AFSCN resources and submit an appropriate downtime
   request to 22 SOPS NOC.
   10.5.2. Ensure 50 SCS and 21 SOPS Circuit Actions receive the concur/non-concur from
   22 SOPS NOC.
   10.5.3. Notify 22 SOPS should DISA still plan on disrupting AFSCN services even after
   they receive AFSCN non-concurrence for the ASI.
   10.5.4. Submit outage reports when communications links are seized or otherwise removed
   from service un-expectedly, resulting in disruption to AFSCN operations.
   10.5.5. Develop local procedures in coordination with 50 SCS Circuit Actions, 21 SOPS
   Circuit Actions, and 22 SOPS NOC to ensure efficient and timely execution of these
   requirements.
 38                                                                50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013


10.6. 22 SOPS NOC will:
   10.6.1. Determine concur/non-concur IAW with downtime procedures in Chapter 9 of this
   instruction.
   10.6.2. Provide concur/non-concur to 21 SOPS comm control.
   10.6.3. Manage IAW chapters above a heads-up notification that DISA still plans on
   disrupting AFSCN services even after receiving an AFSCN non-concurrence.
   10.6.4. Develop local procedures in coordination with 21 SOPS comm control to ensure
   efficient and timely execution of these requirements.
10.7. Procedures. 50 SCS CFP, 21 SOPS PTF, 21 SOPS comm control, and 22 SOPS NOC
will develop local procedures to meet the responsibilities as directed above. In addition to
responsibilities stated above, local procedures will include:
   10.7.1. Appointed individuals acting as primary POC for handling an ASI.
   10.7.2. Contact numbers for each primary POC and supporting work center.
   10.7.3. A process to investigate, and correct when possible, any failure to coordinate an ASI,
   while mitigating future risk.
50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                          39


                                           Chapter 11

                                    VOICE OPERATIONS

11.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes a single primary source of standard voice procedures
for conducting satellite operations within the AFSCN community. The AFSCN utilizes multiple
voice switching systems to support operational voice requirements and to provide redundancy.
11.2. Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN). DRSN is a DoD asset providing secure voice
services to various DoD and federal agencies. The AFSCN utilizes the DRSN switches at SAFB
and VAFB to support satellite operations.
11.3. Integrated Services Telephone (IST). An IST is the primary end instrument for access to
DRSN. The IST may be used to provide access to both secure DRSN services and non-secure
local base telephone services if the supporting infrastructure is in place and properly configured.
ISTs located at the RTSs are configured to provide DRSN services to the SAFB DRSN switch
and to the VAFB DRSN switch.
11.4. PRI Secure Voice (PSV). PSV is the secure voice capability of an RTS. The conveyance
for the secure voice with a RTS is provided by static connections terminating at the RTS PRI
WANIU. RTS secure voice capability with SAFB and with VAFB are treated as two separate
resources in the NTO.
11.5. Satellite Secure Voice Net. The secure voice services provided in support of AFSCN
operations includes dedicated conferences for each RGF site and side. Attachment 5 provides
details for accessing these nets.
   11.5.1. SAFB SVO and VAFB SVO can connect secure calls to any of the RTS nets or to an
   RTS IST extension through SAFB PSV or VAFB PSV.
   11.5.2. SAFB SVO merges IST net buttons for AFSCN users at SAFB with specific site and
   side based on the NTO. This prevents users from accessing the same site and side
   operational nets simultaneously without prior coordination.
   11.5.3. Some AFSCN work centers, such as 21 SOPS comm control, have continuous access
   to all RTS nets. Continuous access to RTS nets is restricted to those work centers with
   proper approval.
11.6. Defense Switch Network (DSN). DSN is a DoD asset providing inter-base non-secure
voice telephone services.
11.7. Private Branch Exchange (PBX). AFSCN facilities are located on federal or military
installations and have access to the local base PBX for non-secure voice services. The local base
PBX provides AFSCN operational areas and work centers with access to both DSN and
commercial telephone networks.
11.8. Tie-line. A tie-line is a dial-up trunk between two PBXs. A caller dialing a tie-line’s
access number will get the dial tone of the remote PBX and be able to dial a number as if the
caller was on a local telephone at that remote location. Access restrictions can be assigned to a
tie-line to prevent abuse.
 40                                                               50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013


   11.8.1. Both SAFB and VAFB have tie-lines established between their local base PBX and
   most of the RGFs. The conveyance for these tie-lines is provided by static connections
   terminating at one of the RTS WANIUs. These tie-lines are not scheduled resources and
   outage conditions for these tie-lines are not reported.
11.9. Conference Bridge. A conference bridge provides a way for various parties to all dial
into an established telephone conference, given a dial-in number for the bridge and a code for
accessing the conference.
   11.9.1. Both SAFB and VAFB have base conference bridges on which have been pre-
   established and dedicated conferences, also referred to as meet-me-nets (MMN), for each
   RGF site and side. Both the SAFB and VAFB bridges have the additional capability of blast
   dialing, calling a pre-established number when a command code is entered by a participant
   who has moderator privileges for the conference call. The RGF MMN blast dials the
   appropriate RGF operational area. Attachment 7 provides details. Note: Generally, the
   MMNs blast dial a DSN number. If there is loss of DSN capability at either location, the
   blast dial will fail.
   11.9.2. The Tech Net and backup Tech Net are also dedicated conferences established on the
   VAFB and SAFB conference bridges and are configured to blast dial 21 SOPS comm
   control.
11.10. AFSCN Voice Operations. The primary method for supporting operations with a RGF
is by using PSV. If an AFSCN user does not have access to PSV, or PSV is unavailable due to a
downtime or outage condition, the user may instead use a MMN. If a MMN is not viable or
otherwise unavailable, a user may dial the site directly using other non-secure voice (NSV)
means, such as DSN, commercial networks, or a tie-line. Attachments 7 and 8 provide further
details.
   11.10.1. A user requiring secure voice communications, where PSV is not available, may
   dial direct using Secure Telephone Equipment (STE) to secure the call. Attachment 7
   provides further details. Note: All operational and support areas are responsible for meeting
   OPSEC and COMSEC requirements.
11.11. AFSCN user will:
   11.11.1. Establish voice communications with all required parties.
   11.11.2. Determine and use the existing AFSCN voice method that best meets their
   operational and security requirements.
   11.11.3. Use the proper terminology IAW Attachment 9, AFSCN Common Operations
   Terminology Lexicon.
   11.11.4. Immediately notify 50 NOG CFP of any detected faults.
11.12. SAFB Secure Voice Operations (SVO) will:
   11.12.1. Provide assistance connecting callers securely with AFSCN operational areas and
   work centers.
   11.12.2. Maintain an up-to-date directory of AFSCN operational areas and work centers
   connected to the SAFB DRSN switch.
50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                              41


   11.12.3. Assist 21 SOPS comm control with fault detection, fault isolation, and fault
   resolution.
   11.12.4. Operate and maintain secure voice recordings of operational nets.
   11.12.5. Perform playbacks of secure voice recordings for cleared individuals.
11.13. VAFB Secure Voice Operations (SVO) will:
   11.13.1. Provide assistance connecting callers securely with AFSCN operational areas and
   work centers.
   11.13.2. Maintain an up-to-date directory of AFSCN operational areas and work centers
   connected to the VAFB DRSN switch.
   11.13.3. Assist in 21 SOPS comm control with fault detection, fault isolation, and fault
   resolution.
   11.13.4. Operate and maintain secure voice recordings of operational nets.
   11.13.5. Perform playbacks of secure voice recordings for cleared individuals.
11.14. 21 SOPS comm control will report and resolve any PSV outage conditions IAW
50SWI 33-101.
11.15. Secure Voice Operations. When personnel are going to discuss classified information,
all parties must prepare for secure communications. Do not discuss classified information until
ALL individuals on the net have acknowledged their area as secured for classified discussion.
   11.15.1. Individuals about to initiate a classified conversation will inform everyone on the
   net.
   11.15.2. All parties on the net will acknowledge and advise if their area is secure or not.
   11.15.3. When a classified discussion is at an end, all parties will acknowledge the end of
   classified discussion.
11.16. Prepass Briefing. Use of proper terminology is important to ensure all parties
understand briefings, directions, and status. Reference attachment 9 for common terminology
use. Satellite operators will clearly brief all information required to support a satellite contact and
any subsequent playback activities prior to the beginning of the pass. The tempo must be slow
enough so the briefing can be fully understood and acknowledged by all parties and properly
transcribed by the RTS operator. The SOC operator will confirm all information read back from
the RTS operator is correct. The following information will be briefed and requested in the
following chronological order as applicable to the satellite operator:
   11.16.1. The satellite operator will:
       11.16.1.1. Ask the RTS for a brief of any new problems that occurred during the
       previous satellite contacts not already shown in ESD.
       11.16.1.2. Brief the classification and scheduled satellite contact times.
       11.16.1.3. Request station status, system time, and RTS operator’s name. A satellite
       operator should be aware of any outages conditions that may affect the support and
       change the prepass brief.
42                                                                50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013


     11.16.1.4. Brief Command/Control/Status (C/C/S) and telemetry routing. The satellite
     operator will include the WANIU telemetry channel designation and data rate for each
     expected telemetry stream, and the PRI and ADD routing of C/C/S and telemetry.
     WANIU telemetry channels are designated as TLM-1 through TLM-5 or Telemetry-1
     through Telemetry-5.

     11.16.2.2. Read back the briefing.
50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                         43


          11.16.2.2.1. Read back the five to seven character IRON configuration exactly as it
          appears in the ARTS PASS ID field or as it appears on the RBC Contact Schedule
          Execution (CSE) GUI.
          11.16.2.2.2. Make any required modifications or changes to the equipment
          configuration during the appropriate periods and then read back those changes as they
          appear on the appropriate ARTS or RBC displays.
          11.16.2.2.3. Read back the actual TLE number in use and time offset entered, if TLE
          is available.
          11.16.2.2.4. Read back the actual satellite contact start time as displayed.
11.17. Prepass Checks. Command, telemetry, and antenna pointing tests will be performed
when sufficient time is available to test signal routing and mission equipment.
   11.17.1. Command Test. The RTS operator will report when command tones are active and
   any anomalous conditions such as echo check errors or Control and Status (C&S) alarms.
   11.17.2. Telemetry Test. The RTS operator will report when a telemetry test directive is
   received and confirm bit synchronizer lock on the appropriate telemetry streams. The satellite
   operator will confirm WANIU channel lock on the appropriate telemetry streams.
   11.17.3. Antenna Pointing (Slave Bus) Test. The RTS operator will report when a C/C/S
   slave bus is received and the antenna is at the briefed point of acquisition. The RTS operator
   will advise the satellite operator of any differences between the briefed and actual point of
   acquisition.
   11.17.4. The satellite operator will report all prepass test results to the RTS operator.
11.18. Satellite Contact. The following details the responsibilities and procedures during a
satellite contact.
   11.18.1. The RTS operator will:
       11.18.1.1. Report the time the transmitter active directive was received and visually
       confirms the transmitter is active, i.e. transmitting to the antenna instead of dummy load.
       11.18.1.2. Enable the uplink modulation, as briefed by the satellite operator, confirm on
       system summary screen uplink modulation is enabled, and report the time uplink
       modulation was enabled.
       11.18.1.3. Confirm good auto-track status and report acquisition signal strength.
       11.18.1.4. Report range acquisition time and confirm range value.
       11.18.1.5. Monitor all equipment for proper status and report any anomalies.
       11.18.1.6. Report telemetry events, as briefed by the satellite operator.
       11.18.1.7. During high elevation space vehicle contacts utilizing a two-axis antenna, take
       the appropriate steps to minimize data loss by following the briefed keyhole procedure or
       briefed loss of voice contingency procedures (keyhole not briefed). Report loss and re-
       acquisition of downlink signal.
   11.18.1.8. Report when the transmitter goes passive.
 44                                                                   50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013


       11.18.1.9. Report loss of downlink signal at fade, as appropriate.
       11.18.1.10. Brief any new problems discovered during the satellite contact immediately.
       It is critical that all parties accurately and clearly report symptoms, provide
       recommendations for problem resolution, and coordinate their actions. Problem
       resolution for satellite contacts will be directed by the satellite operator.
       11.18.1.11. When a problem is encountered during the support the satellite operator will:
           11.18.1.11.1. Ask all parties to standby and take no action because any problem
           resolution activity could cause adverse mission impact or;
           11.18.1.11.2. Take full control of the problem resolution process or;
           11.18.1.11.3. Ask that each party attempt to locally resolve and report actions taken.
11.19. Post-Pass. The following details the responsibilities and procedures after fading from a
satellite contact.
   11.19.1. Satellite operator will direct space vehicle termination or ensure contact is
   automatically terminated at the scheduled stop time.
   11.19.2. The satellite operator will inform all parties when the satellite contact is over, what
   resources are no longer required, and that reconfiguration for the next satellite contact can
   take place.
   11.19.3. NLT 30 seconds after end of the scheduled satellite contact period the satellite
   operator will brief any playback requirement and inform all parties of any problems and
   scoring (successful, marginal, failed, or lost).
   11.19.4. All scheduled resources will be de-configured unless the same SOC is immediately
   scheduled as the next RTS support. The Satellite operator will send a disconnect directive to
   allow the RTS operator to accurately report a good connection on the following support after
   receiving a SARM.
   11.19.5. The RTS operator will verbally remind the satellite operator to disconnect the
   ARTS or RBC resource, if they fail to drop.
11.20. Emergency Satellite Contacts. Any satellite operator declaring a vehicle emergency
must contact 22 SOPS Network Scheduling and inform them of the situation and requirements.
22 SOPS must resolve the declared emergency based on priority, and then verbally contact all
parties involved. If resources are currently in support, 22 SOPS will be added to the voice nets
used to support the satellite contact.
11.21. Request for Satellite Contacts Not Shown in the NTO. If a satellite operator calls for a
satellite contact not shown in the NTO, the RTS operator will:
   11.21.1. Inform the satellite operator the satellite contact is not listed in the NTO.
   11.21.2. Query the other parties on the voice net to determine if the satellite contact is shown
   on a different schedule.
   11.21.3. Ask the satellite operator to immediately contact 22 SOPS Network Scheduling or
   add Network Scheduling to the voice net. Adding Network Scheduling to the voice net
   ensures all parties are properly informed of the outcome.
50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                          45


   11.21.4. Inform the satellite operator how much time is available before the anticipated roll
   call for the next scheduled satellite contact.
   11.21.5. If there is no impact to scheduled operations, initialize the satellite contact for the
   requested satellite while waiting for Network Scheduling response. Do not go active without
   Network Scheduling approval.
11.22. Contingency Operations. If at any time an operational area must evacuate their
operations area, they must contact 22 SOPS Network Scheduling and provide their new phone
numbers as soon as possible.
   11.22.1. If 22 SOPS Network Scheduling must evacuate their operations area, they will
   contact all operational areas and provide alternate contact information.
11.23. Voice Communication Failures. A failure to establish voice connectivity, or the loss of
voice communications during a satellite contact, may impact a satellite operator’s ability to
successfully support a mission. Severity depends upon the cause and available contingency
procedures. Attachment 8 details voice operations contingencies.
   11.23.1. Alternate voice communications must be established regardless of operational
   contingencies for the following:
       11.23.1.1. Incorrect IRON configuration listed in the NTO.
       11.23.1.2. Mission impact of an outage condition is unclear and RTS clarification is
       required.
       11.23.1.3. RTS is not provided with adequate voice communication failure procedures. It
       is the responsibility of each satellite operator to ensure the RTS operator understands
       what coordinated actions to take during a voice communication failure.
       11.23.1.4. Set Asynchronous Response Mode (SARM) coordination required. The
       satellite operator must verbally coordinate a SARM with the RTS operator before sending
       unless the voice communication failure procedure allows for an autonomous SARM at
       ETA minus 5 minutes.
       11.23.1.5. SARM failure.
       11.23.1.6. Improper RTS status received. After sending a SARM and establishing a link,
       the satellite operator should monitor critical RTS status to ensure the antenna is at the
       proper point-of-acquisition, Radiation Warning System (RWS) has timed out and
       transmitter is active, good auto-track has occurred, and valid range is acquired.
       11.23.1.7. Equipment failure detected.
       11.23.1.8. Prepass testing required.
       11.23.1.9. Communication failure procedures state transmitter active is done by satellite
       operator direction only.
       11.23.1.10. Communication failure procedures state enabling uplink modulation is done
       by satellite operator direction only.
       11.23.1.11. Critical RTS event verification required.
       11.23.1.12. Support terminated early or support period extended.
 46                                                                50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013


11.24. Negative Voice Communications. If the satellite operator has not contacted the RTS by
the normal start of prepass tests or by ETA minus 5 minutes (whichever occurs first), the RTS
operator will follow the negative voice communications procedure provided by the applicable
program OD. The RTS operator will check if primary voice is operational and contact 22 SOPS
Network Operations scheduling to determine if the satellite contact was deleted. See attachment
8 for further details.
11.25. Procedures Common to All Loss of Communications Situations. The satellite
operator has the responsibility to ensure voice contact is established or adequate procedures are
available for continued support for any voice communication problems. See Attachment 8 for
further details.
50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                        47


                                          Chapter 12

                       RTS IRON DATABASE CHANGE PROCESS

12.1. Purpose. This process describes how a user submits RTS configuration requirements into
the IRON Database Office (IDO) for incorporation into both the ARTS and RBC ground
systems. It also describes the validation process in order to ensure accurate and timely
implementation of IRON databases to meet users’ requirements.
12.2. Procedures:
   12.2.1. Process Flow. The overall IRON database change process can be seen in Figure 12.2
   which illustrates the responsibilities of the five different organizations (User, IDO, 22 SOPS
   MAF, 22 SOPS/MI and the RTS Operations Teams at BOSS and/or COOK).
   12.2.2. IRON Database Change Request (IDCR) Input. Users and 22 SOPS/Mission
   Integration (MI) generate IDCR forms utilizing current version of the QUICK or RAPID
   Tools, downloadable from Web Based Data Analysis Repository (WeB DARt).
   (https://webdart.schriever.af.mil/webdart/common/main.jsp).
       12.2.2.1. RTS All Parameter IRON Data (RAPID) and Question User’s IRON
       Configuration Knowledge (QUICK) Tools. RAPID and QUICK are desktop computer
       tools that allow users to create accurate IRON Database Change Requests (IDCRs),
       verify changes made within each IRON database delivery and manage RTS Telemetry,
       Tracking and Commanding (TT&C) parameters. Users and support agencies are
       encouraged to download these tools from the access controlled WeB DARt site:
       https://webdart.schriever.af.mil/webdart/common/main.jsp
       12.2.2.2. User generates and sends IDCR to MI (22sopsmsnint@schriever.af.mil) via
       e-mail attachment for technical review. MI will validate information prior to submitting
       to the IDO (DLCO22IRONDB@Honeywell.com) via e-mail as an authorized IDCR.
       12.2.2.3. OPSEC. All content in the IDCR will be kept at the unclassified level. The
       only reference to the satellite or booster being supported will be the four digit IRON(s)
       pre-assigned to the user(s) by 22 SOPS/MAF. No details about upcoming launches or
       critical mission events are to be included on the form. The Need Date is the only “Need
       to Know” information required on the form.
       12.2.2.4. Need Date. The IDCR form includes a space for a user-defined need date.
       The user specifies the date the new or modified configuration is required at the RTS(s) in
       order to support an activity. If no specific need date is required then the word “Routine”
       will be entered in this space, with the understanding the requested configuration(s) will
       be available at the RTS within six months of submittal. Typically all IDCRs should be
       implemented and available at the RTSs within 60 days of submission.               On rare
       occasions, this process time may be compressed to meet unforeseen mission requirements
       with a “Quick Turn” submission.          “Quick Turn” submissions should be kept to a
       minimum due to the large amount of time and resources needed to fulfill these requests.
       Users must plan for configuration contingencies, utilize the temporary “build and save”
       capability at the ARTS sites and make real-time parameter changes with RBC sites
       wherever possible in order to keep “Quick Turn” requests to a minimum.
 48                                                                50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013


   12.2.3. MI Initial Review. MI conducts an initial technical review of the IDCR prior to
   submittal to the IDO. This will include a Need Date validation with the User if the IDCR is
   considered a Quick Turn. MI will evaluate and modify the IDCR when required, with the
   user’s concurrence prior to IDO submittal. This may include signal quality, operational
   improvements, and/or adding other IRONs owned by users requiring the same changes.
12.2.4. IDO Receives the IDCR, builds, tests, and delivers the release package for review.

Figure 12.1. RTS IRON Database Change Process Flowchart




       12.2.4.1. The IDO will analyze all IDCRs submitted and request clarification or
       information from MI if necessary. The IDO will “Rack and Stack” the received IDCRs
50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013                                                                     49


     in the upcoming release packages based on the identified Need Dates and IDO workload.
     The IDO will then respond to the IDCR submittal (within two business days of receipt)
     with an e-mail addressed to both MI and the user, identifying the planned IRON Database
     release version in which the change will be implemented, along with an estimated
     delivery date of the release’s review package. The package delivery date will be at least
     two weeks prior to the earliest Need Date included in the package. The two week period
     is necessary for an MI technical review, correction and re-verification (if necessary),
     delivery, installation and final checkout at BOSS and/or COOK.
  12.2.4.2. IDO will input the applicable IDCR parameters into the ARTS and RBC IRON
  databases and test the newly built or modified IRON configurations in the ARTS
  Development and Modification Facility (ADMF) and/or the RBC Integrated Support Suite
  (RISS). Quick Look Reports (QLRs) will identify which configurations were tested along
  with any test failures or discrepancies.
     12.2.4.3. IDO will provide a 22 SOPS Review Package that includes details of which
     ARTS and RBC IRON Configurations were built, modified or deleted and sufficient
     parameter displays or information to enable MI to assess whether the IRON databases
     were modified according to the user inputs. ARTS IRON Database Table additions and
     modification information will also be included for review. The package should include
     the following: the ARTS Release Description Document (RDD), RBC Screenshots
     (including the System Summary, Downlink, Uplink and Track Displays) of new or
     modified configurations, and the QLRs.
  12.2.5. MI Review and Technical Approval. MI will assess the Review Package documents
  within three business days of receipt to determine if all user inputs were correctly
  implemented in both the ARTS and RBC releases. MI will respond via e-mail to the IDO
  and user if any discrepancies are discovered in the review requiring IDO rework. Once it is
  determined the release is technically accurate, MI will send an e-mail to 22 SOPS/MAF
  recommending technical approval of the release.
     12.2.5.1. RAPID Tool Update. MI will update RAPID with the new release information
     as it is received and OMINS Network Support will announce when it has been posted to
     WeB DARt coinciding with the technical approval of the release.
  12.2.6. 22 SOPS/MAF will generate an e-mail to the IDO, approving the release for RTS
  distribution and another e-mail to COOK and BOSS approving the release for immediate
  ARTS and RBC installation and final delivery inspection. COOK and/or BOSS will utilize
  the “Change” and “New” buttons on the “All Parameters” page of the updated RAPID Tool
  to confirm the updates to the databases have been made correctly. Upon the successful
  verification of the releases at COOK and BOSS they will leave the release on their systems
  and inform 22 SOPS/MAF the release matches the IDCR. If any possible mission impacting
  errors or discrepancies are found during the COOK and/or BOSS verification the release will
  be pulled from the COOK and/or BOSS installations until the IDO corrects the errors and
  updates the release. 22 SOPS will then send an e-mail to all RTSs clearing the release for
  installation, pending local downtime approval.
     12.2.6.1. All RTS sites will send an e-mail to 22 SOPS/MAF, the NSOM Representative
     and the 22SOPS/ Mission Integration mailbox with the date the release was loaded on
     each side of each RTS, completing this process.
 50                                                                 50SWI10217 17 MAY 2013

                                          Chapter 13

          TRANSMIT INHIBIT ZONE (TIZ) AND OBSCURA MANAGEMENT

13.1. Purpose. Accurate TIZ and Obscura data is essential to satellite contact efficiency and
safety.
13.2. Procedure. Obscura data resides in the Web Base Data Analysis and Repository (WeB
DARt) database which is maintained by 22 SOPS/MAO and is used to maximize satellite contact
times during mission operations. 22 SOPS/MAO is the only granting authority for both TIZs
and Obscura data at each of the RGFs. Both obscura and TIZ values must be determined and
implemented to establish when a satellite is visible from an antenna and provide safe operating
parameters for RTS personnel on-site. The RTS uses these TIZs for radiation safety compliance
during antenna operation. Obscura and TIZ data must be accurate and current for use in the
AFSCN.
   13.2.1. Obscura surveys identify 360-degree horizon profiles for each site antenna. Both
   hard and soft obscura data are obtained for each site’s horizon profile. Hard obscura includes
   terrain, and structures both on and off site. Soft obscura includes the vegetation height above
   the hard obscura.
   13.2.2. TIZs identify ranges of Azimuth and Elevation in which antenna transmission is
   prohibited. This prevents unsafe RF exposure to personnel on terrain, equipment or in
   buildings within the radiation hazard (RadHaz) distance from each antenna per IEEE C95.1-
   2005, Standard for Safety Levels with Respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency
   Electromagnetic Fields, 3 kHz to 300 GHz. There are two types of TIZs, temporary and
   permanent. TIZs are considered temporary when the duration they are implemented is 30
   days or less. Permanent TIZs are in place for more than 30 days and are installed in WeB
   DARt.
   13.2.3. Periodic obscura/TIZ assessments must be accomplished to identify temporary or
   permanent changes to antenna views and/or safe parameters to determine the need for
   detailed obscura/TIZ surveys. The 22 SOPS Obscura Integrated Product Team (IPT)
   monitors RTS working groups gather information about construction and other site activities
   that may cause changes to obscura and TIZ profiles from RTS personnel, RNL personnel or
   other agencies that are performing modifications to the RTS that will impact the current
   Obscura or TIZs. Obscura and TIZ profiles are continuously monitored and should be
   reevaluated at least every 2 years to determine the need for on-site obscura surveys.
   13.2.4. If obscura/TIZ values change for a Remote Tracking Antenna, the new approved
   profiles will be integrated into WeB DARt by the Obscura IPT. Updates will be placed in
   WeB DARt and an automated message will be sent to all WeB DARt users so that they may
   implement the change in their software. These changes are also sent to the RTS to update the
   TIZs.

                              SECURE VOICE PROCEDURES

A5.1. Secure Voice Conference Nets. Many AFSCN areas have one or more DRSN ISTs
configured to access the Configuration Nets. The classification for any conversation is limited to
SECRET.
   A5.1.1. Access     the Net and announce your presence using                    the   following
   format:            <your call-sign> + “on” + optionally “the net”
A5.2. DRSN Direct-dial. Many AFSCN areas have one or more DRSN ISTs between which a
direct call can be made. The classification for any call is established IAW DISAC.
   A5.2.1. When calling a DRSN extension from the same DRSN switch (locally), simply dial
   the last four numbers of the DRSN number.
   A5.2.2. When calling from a different DRSN switch, dial 80 followed by the full DRSN
   number.
   A5.2.3. Tables A5.1 to A5.9 provides the DRSN numbers for each RTS positions. An RTS
   IST is connected to both the SAFB and VAFB DRSN switches and can receive a call through
   either switch as if local to that location.
