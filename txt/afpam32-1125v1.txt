This volume in this pamphlet series provides an overview of the functions of the operations management
specialist in the Civil Engineer Operations Flight. This pamphlet series supports Air Force Instruction
(AFI) 32-1001, Operations Management, as the AFI that implements Air Force Policy Directives (AFPD)
32-10, Installations and Facilities and 32-11, Installations and Facilities. Maintain and dispose of records
created as a result of prescribed processes in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 37-139,
Records Disposition Schedule.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
Fire protection coordination is required if building traffic is affected by proposed work (paragraph 4.6.5.).
Records maintenance requirements were updated (paragraph 5.12.). New labor utilization codes (LUC)
15-1 and 34-1 were added (Table 6.1., paragraphs 6.2.5., 6.2.8. and 6.2.12.). References to obsolete AF
Form 1734, BCE Daily Work Sheet, were deleted (paragraphs 6.4., 6.4.1., 6.4.2., 6.6.). The height for
assigning lighting maintenance responsibility was changed from 3.7 meters (12 feet) to 3 meters (10 feet)
(paragraph 11.4.4.). The base civil engineer (BCE) may designate offices to conduct facility manager
training (paragraph 11.9.). Replaced AF Form 198, Report of Survey for Air Force Property, with DD
Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss, as a requirement for accident investiga-
tions (paragraph 13.11.1.8.1.). Changed or revised material is indicated by a bar (|).

AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                              7


                                               Chapter 1

                                  OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT

1.1. Concept. As outlined in AFMAN 36-2108, Enlisted Classification, operations management person-
nel are responsible for activating and managing civil engineer command and control centers during peace-
time, wartime, and contingency operations. Operations management processes and controls work
requirements in contingency, wartime, and peacetime situations for work performed by civil engineers, as
well as maintains accountability of resources.

1.2. Customer Relations.
   1.2.1. The civil engineering mission is to provide assets and skilled personnel to prepare and sustain
   global installations as stationary platforms for the projection of aerospace power in peace and war. By
   doing this, civil engineers help the Air Force meet its mission of aerospace power. Some functions and
   roles of the customer service provider are:
       1.2.1.1. Communicating customer needs.
       1.2.1.2. Providing a problem-solving service.
       1.2.1.3. Developing a cooperative working relationship.
       1.2.1.4. Coordinating and monitoring customer needs.
       1.2.1.5. Cooperative management.
       1.2.1.6. Ensuring a professional performance.
   1.2.2. There are two primary methods for identification of requirements and initiation of service
   requests. The most efficient method is for the customer to call or come into the customer service unit
   (CSU). The second method is to establish a scheduled facility visits program, which reduces the num-
   ber of walk-ins and telephone calls for routine work by letting the customer know when and why ser-
   vice is scheduled.
   1.2.3. Communication between the customer and the civil engineer representative is key to develop-
   ing a successful relationship that meets the customer’s needs. Communication also means informing
   the customer of potential problems that may affect the requested requirement. Issues such as material
   shortfalls, long lead times, man-hour availability, and specialty crafts or skill level concerns brought
   to the attention of the customer early in the planning or programming phases will promote customer
   satisfaction and increase workforce efficiency after the task or project is started or completed.

1.3. Quality Service.
   1.3.1. Quality service involves knowing your customer, the customer’s requirements, and meeting
   those requirements in a timely manner. AFI 32-1001, Operations Management, states the base civil
   engineer (BCE) will establish a process to measure and continuously improve their support of base
   missions and customers. The purpose of the evaluation program is to motivate timely and quality ser-
   vice to BCE customers. The evaluation program is a management tool that can be used to improve
   customer relations and productivity of the operations work force.
8                                                                      AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


    1.3.2. Customer service monitors the BCE quality control evaluation program and must ensure there
    are an adequate supply of forms in the service call section, CSU, and the programming and scheduling
    functions. The worker gives each customer a copy of the form when he or she arrives at the job site.
    The form should contain the direct schedule or work order number, description of the work or service
    requested, facility number, and the name of the worker. The remainder of the form is completed later
    by the customer and sent to the BCE. The BCE’s quality control evaluation program reports customer
    satisfaction and provides leadership and management information to improve civil engineer respon-
    siveness to customers’ needs.

1.4. Work Control. The installation will use approved forms to control work requirements, including the
following:
    1.4.1. AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request - Used to request accomplishment of
    described work.
    1.4.2. AF Form 327, Base Civil Engineer Work Order - Used to authorize work orders.

                                             SERVICE CALL

2.1. Function. CE maintains a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week capability to respond to emergency work.
The service call function accepts verbal work order requests, including telephone and walk-in customer
requests.
     2.1.1. The service call function is an integral part of the CSU and typically located nearby.
     2.1.2. The service call room should be a soundproof enclosure. It should have a service call window
     to CSU, adequate space for wall maps, a console designed to accommodate radio and telephone sys-
     tems, and a secure area for storing keys, portable radios, and battery chargers.
     2.1.3. The service call function may serve as the BCE command center during emergency operations.
     For this purpose, the following information must be readily available:
        2.1.3.1. BCE contingency response plan.
        2.1.3.2. Base disaster preparedness plan.
        2.1.3.3. Base deployment/wing mobility plans.
        2.1.3.4. Snow-removal plan, if applicable.
        2.1.3.5. Base supplements, BCE operating instructions, checklists, and other instructions for
        emergency situations.
        2.1.3.6. Oil and hazardous substance contingency plan.
        2.1.3.7. Utility contingency plan.

2.2. Do-It-Now (DIN) Classification.
     2.2.1. The service call operator will determine the classification of the work requested. (DSW classi-
     fication is outlined in Chapter 3.) If the BCE organization has a DIN function and if the work appears
     to be within the capability of the DIN worker, the DIN worker is dispatched and the automated civil
     engineer work order system is updated accordingly.
     2.2.2. If the work was attempted but not completed by the DIN worker, only the actual hours used are
     entered under labor utilization code (LUC) 12 or 14 (paragraph 6.2.). The DIN worker provides all
     necessary additional information to make sure the next visit completes the job. If the work requested
     is beyond the capability of the DIN worker, it is given to the appropriate scheduler/shop foreman.
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                             11


                                               Chapter 3

                               DIRECT SCHEDULED WORK (DSW)

3.1. Concept. DSW is a quick method to authorize work that does not exceed 50 man-hours (Air Force
Pamphlet [AFPAM] 32-1004, Volume 3, Working in the Operations Flight Facility Maintenance, Chapter
4), requires detailed planning, or extraordinary material costs. DSWs are classified as emergency, urgent,
and routine.
   3.1.1. Emergency. An emergency includes, but is not limited to, the failure of any utility, fire protec-
   tion, environmental controls, security alarms, or a stopped-up sewer. It may also include elimination
   of fire, health, or safety hazards that have been assigned a risk assessment code (RAC) 1 or fire safety
   deficiency code (FSDC) I (AFI 32-1001, paragraph 8).
   3.1.2. Urgent. Urgent work includes elimination of health, fire, or safety hazards that have been
   assigned RAC 2 or 3, or FSDC II (AFI 32-1001, paragraph 8).
   3.1.3. Routine. Routine work includes hazards that have been assigned RAC 3 or FSDC III or IV
   (AFI 32-1001, paragraph 8).

3.2. Authorization.
   3.2.1. DSW orders are processed in accordance with AFI 32-1001. DSWs are authorized on AF Form
   1219, AF Form 1879, or in the automated civil engineer work order system. The Interim Work Infor-
   mation Management System (IWIMS) work control authorization to initiate DSWs is considered an
   assumption of approval and authorization to complete the work. DSWs are estimated by using the
   Engineering Performance Standard (EPS) handbooks, when possible. Otherwise, the planning func-
   tion, if applicable, or shop personnel should provide the estimated time to complete the work.
   3.2.2. Notify the financial management and family housing management offices any time work is to
   be accomplished on general officer quarters (GOQ).

3.3. Unauthorized Use. DSWs are not used to authorize:
   3.3.1. Minor construction (MC) work on leased facilities.
   3.3.2. Work done by contract, except repair of equipment.
   3.3.3. Operations work (authorized by a collection work order number [CWON]) (Chapter 10).
   3.3.4. Services (e.g., street sweeping, grass cutting, snow removal), excluding individual requests for
   entomology services (authorized by CWON).
   3.3.5. Recurring work.
   3.3.6. Work that must be capitalized on real property records.

3.4. Cancellation. DSWs are cancelled in accordance with AFI 32-1001, paragraph 9. CSU notifies the
customers, in writing when practical, when DSWs are cancelled.

3.5. Processing. DSWs are generated in several different ways: verbal requests; work identified on AF
Form 332 and AF Form 1219; electronic mail; and from sources within CE. Care must be taken to ensure
12                                                                AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


the proper description of work is used on all DSWs. Proper and complete justification can reduce misun-
derstanding of the full scope of work to be done and the urgency of work. When the work description or
justification is vague or confusing, the customer must be contacted for clarification.

3.6. Bill of Materials (BOM). The BOM is used to acquire material needed to complete a DSW (para-
graph 8.3.). After the BOM has been prepared, operations management personnel may need to assign a
required delivery date (RDD).

3.7. Tracking. Each time the DSW is moved from one location to another it must be tracked. If a DSW
is moved for other than normal processing, remarks should be added with a brief reason for the tracking
location change.
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                            13


                                                Chapter 4

                                    WRITTEN WORK REQUESTS

4.1. Purpose. This chapter describes how to prepare and process written requests for work. The sug-
gested procedures are designed to assist the CE organization by clarifying the written work order process.

4.2. CSU. The CSU manages work order requests by:
   4.2.1. Receiving and tracking all written work requests by assigning a work request number.
   4.2.2. Receiving in writing delegated approval and disapproval authority.
   4.2.3. Maintaining the current status of all requests.
   4.2.4. Providing service to walk-in and telephone customers.

4.3. BCE Work Request. AF Form 332 is used to request and approve all work, except for:
   4.3.1. Work in excess of the installation commander’s (IC) approval level.
   4.3.2. Work to be funded by the major command (MAJCOM).
   4.3.3. Work to be done by contract within the IC's approval authority if the MAJCOM requires addi-
   tional approval documentation.
   4.3.4. Local manufacture or non-NSN supply or equipment items. These items require the following
   forms:
       4.3.4.1. For non-NSN items, the using activity will submit DD Form 1348-6, DOD Single Line
       Item Requisition System Document, with the necessary drawings, to the Supply Squadron.
       Drawings and examples need not accompany the DD Form 1348-6 when the remarks block con-
       tains a statement that the manufacturing activity currently possesses the necessary documents.
       4.3.4.2. For items of local manufacture, a DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document,
       endorsed by the Supply Squadron, is also needed. The DD Form 1348-1A is used for receipt or
       issue transactions on completion of local manufacture and for reimbursement of BCE costs when
       the customer chooses not to use a government purchasing card (GPC) for a local purchase.
   4.3.5. Self-help work that is:
       4.3.5.1. The tenant’s responsibility as defined by the family housing management office.
       4.3.5.2. Minor maintenance and repair work done with over-the-counter materials from the
       self-help store.
   4.3.6. Work not requiring individual costing that is properly authorized by the collection work order
   list, AF Form 1219, the recurring work program (RWP), automated or manual DSW not requiring real
   property capitalization, or changes to as-built drawings.

4.4. BCE Work Request/Work Order Register. CSU uses automated systems or AF Form 1081 for
tracking and controlling AF Form 332 and AF Form 327.
14                                                                        AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


4.5. Hazard Correction. All written requests for work that request BCE action for the elimination or
correction of hazards are submitted to the BCE by the requester as follows:
     4.5.1. Fire hazards are coordinated through the Fire Protection Flight for assignment of an FSDC.
     4.5.2. Health or environmental hazards are coordinated through the base bioenvironmental engineer
     (usually assigned to the base hospital) for assignment of an Occupational Safety and Health Adminis-
     tration (OSHA) code or RAC.
     4.5.3. Safety hazards are coordinated through the base, wing, or other authorized safety representative
     safety office for RAC assignment.
     4.5.4. Environmental hazards are coordinated through the Environmental Engineering Flight for cat-
     egorical exclusion (CATEX) or initiation of AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact
     Analysis.
     4.5.5. Airfield work requests and projects must:
         4.5.5.1. Be coordinated with the airfield manager and wing safety office.
         4.5.5.2. Ensure a temporary waiver is obtained at least 45 days before the scheduled construction
         start date. NOTE: Waivers must be approved before the start of airfield construction activities.
         4.5.5.3. Ensure the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is notified in accordance with the
         requirements of Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable Air-
         space, Paragraph 77.13 (see Unified Facilities Criteria [UFC] 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport
         Planning and Design).
         4.5.5.4. Ensure construction and design meet frangibility requirements described within
         UFC 3-260-01.

4.6. Work Request Preparation and Review. The AF Form 332 is prepared as an original and three
copies. The CSU personnel will review the request and determine if:
     4.6.1. The request has been properly prepared and blocks 1 through 14 have been completely filled
     out. CSU personnel will fill out block 4.
     4.6.2. The requested work requires an environmental impact. If the work does not automatically qual-
     ify for CATEX from further environmental analysis, an AF Form 813 should accompany the AF Form
     332.
     4.6.3. The work is not already identified for a contract or as a duplicate in-service request.
     4.6.4. The work supports the planned use of the facility.
     4.6.5. All coordination has been obtained. If additional coordination is needed, CSU may offer to
     obtain the additional coordination for the customer as provided in AFI 32-1001, paragraph 6. NOTE:
     Fire protection coordination should be obtained on all requested work when life, safety, fire-alarm or
     suppression systems, fire rating of materials, fire protection access to an area or facility, or fire protec-
     tion criteria (i.e., movement of any walls or doors that can affect movement within or out of a facility)
     is affected by the proposed work.
     4.6.6. The required signature is in block 13. For example, the unit commander must sign all requests
     for new construction or recoring facility locks.
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                             15


4.7. Acceptance of the Request. All work requests received are assigned a number from the
AF Form 1081. The description of the work request is also entered in the register. CSU personnel will
notify the requester when the request is accepted or rejected. If rejected, clearly explain why the request
was rejected, and if accepted:
   4.7.1. The work request may be entered into the appropriate computerized file of the automated civil
   engineering work order system using work order indicator “D”.
   4.7.2. Use the work request number as the work order number if the work is authorized by an in-ser-
   vice work order or as a DSW. The IWIMS program will assign work request numbers.
   4.7.3. Set up a work request folder to be used for comments and recommendations on requests that
   must be sent to BCE functions for review. Place the original AF Form 332 with supporting documents,
   such as sketches, drawings, maps, or funding letters, in the folder.
   4.7.4. When the requested work is above the IC’s approval authority or class M (maintenance), R
   (repair), or MC (minor construction) to be funded by the MAJCOM, CSU personnel will send the AF
   Form 332 to the Engineering Flight.
NOTE: The planning function, Engineering Flight, or maintenance engineering section makes on-site
investigations, resource estimates, and technical evaluations when needed to help the reviewer approve
the work request.

4.8. Approval.
   4.8.1. The approval authority completes AF Form 332 blocks 15 through 30, and assigns the work
   request priority in accordance with AFI 32-1001, paragraph 8. Approval or disapproval of
   AF Form 332 may be determined by the following:
       4.8.1.1. BCE. Approval authority should be delegated to the lowest level practicable in the BCE
       organization. Disapproval levels are not normally established, but the BCE may exercise the
       option to disapprove work requests regardless of their anticipated cost.
       4.8.1.2. IC. The IC may make the decision. There are two ways to help the IC achieve corporate
       agreement on priorities and make recommendations about approval or disapproval of work
       requests:
           4.8.1.2.1. Staff Meetings. Use staff meetings or the commander's update briefing.
           4.8.1.2.2. Facilities Utilization Board (FUB). The FUB reviews any request that exceeds
           installation approval authority or requires funding by the MAJCOM. If the FUB validates the
           request, the Engineering Flight will process the necessary project documents to the MAJCOM
           for approval.
   4.8.2. CSU personnel will:
       4.8.2.1. Update AF Form 1081.
       4.8.2.2. Notify the requester of the decision. If approved, explain the subsequent action to com-
       plete the work. If disapproved, clearly explain the reason why.
       4.8.2.3. Use the following guidance when assigning specific work priorities to work order
       requirements when a RAC or FSDC has been assigned. NOTE: When a RAC, FSDC, or OSHA
16                                                                   AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


        code has been assigned to the work request, it is necessary to annotate the number in the appropri-
        ate block on AF Form 327.
            4.8.2.3.1. RAC I - Priority I - FSDC I.
            4.8.2.3.2. RAC 2 or 3 - Priority II - FSDC II.
            4.8.2.3.3. RAC 4 - Priority III - FSDC III.
            4.8.2.3.4. RAC 5 - Priority IV - FSDC IV or V.

4.9. Processing Approved Work Requests. When practicable, like items of work should be grouped for
authorization with one document.
     4.9.1. Contract Work. Send the AF Form 332 with work to be performed by contract to the contract
     programmer. CSU may provide the financial manager a block of work order numbers for contract
     work. When the contract project number is assigned, enter the project number on AF Form 1081 when
     a manual system is used. Automated versions require the engineering programmer to attach the work
     order number to the project in the Automated Civil Engineer System Project Manager (ACES PM).
     Close the work order and return a copy of the AF Form 332 to the customer with the contract project
     number noted on the form.
     4.9.2. Self-help Work. Process self-help work according to local procedures.
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                             17


                                                Chapter 5

                                           WORK ORDERS

5.1. Concept. AF Form 327 is used to authorize work that needs detailed planning. The decision to use a
work order is based on estimated man-hours exceeding 50 hours (but less than 250 to 300 hours), capital-
ization of real property records, collecting reimbursements, and gathering data for review and analysis. In
general, work done by contract is approved on DD Form 1391 or AF Form 332 and funding authorized on
AF Form 9, Request for Purchase. AF Form 327 is used to collect individual contract costs. Normally,
service contracts are approved and authorized on AF Form 327 and funding authorized on AF Form 9.

5.2. BCE Work Order. Use AF Form 327 to authorize:
   5.2.1. Work by contract, except contract maintenance of equipment.
   5.2.2. Work (including self-help) requiring capitalization, regardless of the source of funds.
   5.2.3. Work done by the Engineering Flight on MCP projects when the Air Force is the design agent,
   and to collect non-BCE costs for work on MCP projects.
   5.2.4. Work done by the Engineering Flight on military family housing (MFH) projects when the
   design costs are reimbursable.
   5.2.5. Architectural and engineering service contracts.
   5.2.6. Changes to work orders.
   5.2.7. Any other work where individual costing, detailed planning, or capitalization is required.

5.3. Processing In-service Work Orders. Send the work order package to the planning function or other
entity responsible for planning work orders at your installation (Chapter 7). The work order status and
indicator will remain “D” until authorized to prevent unauthorized charges being placed against the work
order.

5.4. Work Order Review.
   5.4.1. The chief of operations management CSU reviews the entire work order package to determine:
       5.4.1.1. The adequacy of the work plan.
       5.4.1.2. That an accurate Air Force account code, customer code, and reimbursement refund indi-
       cator (RRI) are applied.
       5.4.1.3. The need to capitalize work on real property records.
       5.4.1.4. The need for special precautionary measures.
       5.4.1.5. The required completion date is feasible.
       5.4.1.6. The package contains all necessary documentation (AF Form 103, complete BOM, draw-
       ings, planning phases and tasks) to commence work.
   5.4.2. After the chief of operations management CSU reviews the work order package, the work
   request package will be forwarded to the in-service work package (IWP) programmer.
18                                                                    AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


     5.4.3. The IWP programmer will determine when the work should be done. This decision is based on
     work-hour availability of participating shops, material lead-time, the date requested by the customer,
     and the priority of the work. The programmer will send the work order to the proper approval author-
     ity for authorization.
     5.4.4. If funds are available for material or equipment requirements, the approval authority will sign
     the work order and returns it to the IWP programmer. If funds are not available, the work order will be
     returned unsigned to the IWP programmer to be held until the funds deficiency is resolved. The IWP
     programmer will keep the chief of operations management CSU advised of the backlog of work orders
     awaiting funds. If funds become available, the approval authority will sign the work order, update the
     automated system as required, and return it to the IWP programmer.
     5.4.5. The IWP programmer will update the estimated start and completion date on AF Form 1445,
     item 19, and on the work order folder. Once authorized, a routine RDD will be assigned and the pack-
     age tracked to the logistics section. The RDD is established to receive delivery of materials before the
     estimated start date (ESD). The IWP programmer will work with the logistics function to ensure the
     timely delivery of materials.
     5.4.6. When materials are complete and have been reviewed by planning, the work order will be
     returned to the IWP programmer. The IWP programmer will validate the programmed start month and
     release the work order to the scheduler. The scheduler will coordinate with appropriate shop personnel
     and the customer to schedule the work.

5.5. Special Work Requirements. The shop supervisors must brief their workers on the nature and loca-
tion of any safety hazards before starting any work that needs special precautions to be applied. An AF
Form 103 must be approved before starting any hazardous work.

5.6. Reprogramming a Work Order. If a work order is reprogrammed, the programmer changes the
ESD in the automated file or manually in the work order package and notifies the customer of the change.

5.7. Work Order Completion.
     5.7.1. When the job is completed, the shop supervisor (or job monitor):
        5.7.1.1. Inspects the work for quality and completeness.
        5.7.1.2. Makes sure that excess or residue material and equipment are cleaned, inventoried, and
        labeled with DD Form 1574, Serviceable Tag - Materiel. The material and equipment will be
        turned over to the logistics function for disposition. Materials in quantities less than a unit pack
        (e.g., partial sheets, coils, or boxes) may be kept in the shop for future use.
        5.7.1.3. Reviews material issued for the work order to ensure the quantity and type were commen-
        surate with the work done and the work order folder includes documentation supporting any addi-
        tional materials requisitioned by shop workers.
        5.7.1.4. Documents non-Air Force excess materials or equipment used.
        5.7.1.5. Signs AF Form 327 as indicated in the “On-site Coordinator” block and furnishes draw-
        ings, sketches, and information needed to update record drawings or RWP records.
        5.7.1.6. Returns AF Form 327 and all supporting documents to the scheduler when all the above
        actions are completed. The package is then sent to the scheduler.
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                              19


   5.7.2. Upon receipt of signed copies of the completed AF Form 327, the scheduler:
       5.7.2.1. Returns copies of the AF Form 327 and supporting documents to the work order folder.
       5.7.2.2. Makes sure all the labor, material, and equipment actions that influence the cost of work
       order or real property records have been reported, including entering the actual costs of installing
       non-Air Force excess material or equipment. If the actual costs are not known, use the fair market
       value.
       5.7.2.3. On receipt of the final BOM closeout, gets the signature of the chief of operations or a
       designated representative on the original AF Form 327 in the final certification block, and requests
       a final closeout report.
       5.7.2.4. Sends a copy of AF Form 327 to the financial management and family housing manage-
       ment offices for work on GOQ.
       5.7.2.5. Sends the completed work order folder to the CSU.
       5.7.2.6. Enters the final closeout transaction in the work order folder.
       5.7.2.7. Sends the work order folder to real estate management if a change to the real property
       records or record drawings is indicated, and forwards the package for possible voucher number
       and action.
       5.7.2.8. Forwards the package to the Engineering Flight’s drafting section when as-built drawing
       updates are required.
       5.7.2.9. After all actions are completed, the folder is returned to the CSU for final disposition and
       placed on file in the CSU closeout staging area.

5.8. Change Orders. Process change orders in accordance with AFI 32-1001, paragraph 9.

5.9. Work Order Cancellation. Process cancellations in accordance with AFI 32-1001, paragraph 9.
   5.9.1. The work order may be cancelled at any time.
   5.9.2. When proper authority directs cancellation of a work order, CSU (or the financial manager for
   contract work orders):
       5.9.2.1. Contacts each activity and advises them to discontinue any further work.
       5.9.2.2. Retrieves all copies of the work order (draft or final) and writes "cancelled" on the origi-
       nal AF Form 327, or types “cancelled” in the remarks section of the automated system.
       5.9.2.3. Closes the work order if costs have not been accumulated. If costs have accumulated in
       the automated system, a normal close transaction will be initiated.
       5.9.2.4. Notifies the requester of work order cancellation.
       5.9.2.5. Files the work order folder and notifies the programmer of the cancellation.

5.10. Real Property Capitalization. Work orders that change real property records are sent to real estate
management for capitalization when the work is completed. Drawings of the area before and after the
change need to be included in the package to real estate management. NOTE: See AFI 32-1032, Chapter
20                                                                     AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


5 for specific guidance on accomplishing multiple minor military construction projects in a single facility.
If the work order involves the following, capitalization is generally required:
     5.10.1. New construction, including installed equipment, that extends the useful life two or more
     years and costs $5,000 or more.
     5.10.2. Increase in the overall square footage by conversion, extension, addition, expansion, or alter-
     ation, including installed equipment, that extends the useful life two or more years and costs $5,000 or
     more.
     5.10.3. Permanently attached installed equipment (addition or removal).
     5.10.4. Increase or decrease in square yards of pavement surface area.
     5.10.5. Increase or decrease in linear feet of railroad trackage or appurtenances.
     5.10.6. Increase or decrease in linear feet of utility infrastructure, including electrical, natural gas,
     water, sewer, or fuel mains.
     5.10.7. Increase or decrease in the number of windows, air conditioners, or air-conditioning tonnage.
     5.10.8. Increase or decrease in the liquid fuel system or pumps, and in linear feet of aboveground
     exterior fuel pipelines.
     5.10.9. Increase or decrease in the capacity (British thermal unit per hour [Btuh]) of heating plants.
     5.10.10. Increase or decrease in the capacity (kilovolt-ampere [kVA]) of substations, or in the number
     of street lights, linear feet of airfield lighting, number of traffic lights, or number of precision
     approach path indicator (PAPI) or pulse light approach slope indicator (PLASI) lighting systems.
     5.10.11. Increase or decrease in electric power generation in aircraft arresting support systems or total
     number of automatic transfer panels.
     5.10.12. Increase or decrease in wells, distribution pumps, water storage capacity, treatment plants,
     pumps, water softness, demineralizers, or sanitary lift stations.

5.11. Work Order Analysis. For completed work orders that have significant variance between actual
and estimated hours, a preliminary review will be performed. A significant variance is an amount over or
under 25 percent of the original detailed planned estimated or authorized amount. Operations manage-
ment, in coordination with the appropriate shop supervisors and the planning function, will perform the
preliminary review to determine the cause of variance. The results will be documented and made a perma-
nent addition to the work order package.

5.12. Facility Files. There are various ways to maintain facility folders; however, each facility should
have a folder or a file kept in the operations management work center. The facility file is a collection point
for all documentation and historical data for each facility. Maintain and dispose of records created as a
result of prescribed processes in accordance with AFMAN 37-139, Table 32, rules 6 and 7, Records Dis-
position Schedule. Use facility files to maintain copies of the following documents for each facility or log-
ical group of facilities (requirements may vary from base to base): AF Form 327; DD Form 1391; AF
Form 332; AF Form 1219; and disposal plans.

                                        TIME ACCOUNTING

6.1. Concept. Time accounting is used to distribute hours and costs to work orders and cost account
codes. Time accounting is a combination of actual time accounting (ATA) and exceptional time account-
ing (ETA) reporting systems. Each BCE cost center is assigned one method to report time. All personnel
in each cost center will report time the same way, ETA or ATA. It provides data to:
   6.1.1. Prepare cost estimates, scheduling, and programming work in the IWP.
   6.1.2. Justify vehicles, budget inputs, and personnel requirements.
   6.1.3. Analyze and solve problems.

6.2. Labor Utilization Code (LUC). LUCs are codes used to identify direct and indirect work per-
formed by ATA cost centers. The work hours charged against LUCs are also used for analysis purposes.

Table 6.1. Standard LUCs.
                      Direct
  11   Recurring work
  12   Emergency DSW
  14   Urgent DSW
  15   Minor military construction work order
 15-1 Minor construction DSW
  16   Routine DSW
  18   Maintenance, repair, or other work orders
  19   Plant operations
  20   Readiness training
                      Indirect
  31   Supervision
  32   Training
  33   Leave
  34   All other
 34-1 Long-term rotations
  38   Overtime
  39   Loaned hours

   6.2.1. Recurring work (LUC 11) is repetitive work already identified on the RWP. This is productive
   work like grass cutting and annual flushing and testing of water hydrants.
22                                                                    AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


     6.2.2. Emergency work (LUC 12) requires immediate action, occurs within 24 hours, and normally is
     identified by telephone contact to operations management. LUC 12 could be a down and arcing
     high-voltage electrical line (see AFI 32-1001, paragraph 8).
     6.2.3. Urgent work (LUC 14) requires action within five days, but does not pose a threat to opera-
     tional effectiveness or to government property. LUC 14 might be a minor amount of water seeping
     from the ground (see AFI 32-1001, paragraph 8).
     6.2.4. Routine work (LUC 16) is a DSW not qualifying for higher priority. Routine DSWs are either
     telephoned in to operations management or taken from AF Form 332 (see AFI 32-1001, paragraph 8).
     6.2.5. Minor construction (MC) work (LUC 15) is classified as additional real property installed
     equipment (RPIE) or an increase to the footprint of a facility. NOTE: MC DSW requests (LUC
     15-1) are classified as LUC 15, the exception being the scope of DSW. This work generally does not
     require detailed planning, yet falls in the MC category.
     6.2.6. LUC 18 is used on all other maintenance or repair work orders. The work order requires that it
     be added to part two of AF Form 561.
     6.2.7. Utility operations (LUC 19) identifies all labor expended in support of plant or utility opera-
     tions (e.g., water plant operations).
     6.2.8. Readiness training (LUC 20) work orders are established to collect Priority Improved Manage-
     ment Effort – Base Engineer Emergency Force (Prime BEEF) training time at a local station or orga-
     nized mobility training. LUC 20 is used for field exercises, chemical warfare training, and self-aid and
     buddy care. NOTE: LUC 20 is not designed for long-term rotations (179 days in and out of theater)–
     use LUC 34-1 for long-term rotations of up to 179 days.
     6.2.9. Supervision (LUC 31) is used by the shop supervisor for managerial responsibilities and meet-
     ings.
     6.2.10. Training (LUC 32) is used when workers are performing their primary duties but are learning
     the tasks. LUC 32 can also be used to carry Career Development Course (CDC) study time when
     authorized by the on-duty shop supervisor. Progressive career specialty classroom training should be
     charged to LUC 32.
     6.2.11. Leave (LUC 33) is charged when military or civilian employees are on authorized leave away
     from the duty section. Sick leave, leave without pay, and regular leave is all charged by LUC 33.
     Leave is a typical LUC choice to add a special study code to subdivide different types of leave.
     6.2.12. LUC 34 collects all other indirect labor time. Examples of LUC 34 are Commander’s Call,
     vehicle lag time, planning functions, military appointments, and three-day passes for military mem-
     bers. NOTE: Use LUC 34-1 for long-term rotations of up to 179 days.
     6.2.13. LUC 38 is used to report all overtime (military and civilian) for ATA personnel.
     6.2.14. LUC 39 is used when personnel are loaned between BCE cost centers.

6.3. LUC Special Study Codes. Each LUC can be subdivided into nine special study codes (determined
by local policy and management practices) to collect more detailed data for analysis. After the needed
data is obtained, the special study code should be deleted and the hours reported to the basic LUC. Special
study codes should not be used for longer than six months.
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                              23


6.4. ATA Cost Center. Cost centers that use more than one account code use the ATA method. Cost cen-
ters that use the ATA method report direct and indirect hours against work order numbers and LUCs.
Operations cost centers using the scheduler concept report hours daily. Labor reported in shop labor is
reported daily. Shop supervisors ensure all time is reported before the close of the day.
   6.4.1. Holiday Leave. Holiday leave is not reported unless labor is being charged for shift workers.
   6.4.2. Regular Day Off (RDO). For shift workers such as plant operators, the RDO may occur on a
   weekday; this is not considered leave. Enter the RDO to show the individual is accounted for, but no
   time is reported for the day.

6.5. ETA Cost Center. Cost centers that do work related to one BCE or MFH account code use the ETA
method. Direct and indirect hours are not reported by ETA cost centers except for hours loaned (LUC 39)
between ETA and ATA cost centers. Loaned hours are not reported for ETA-to-ETA cost center assign-
ments, except when assigned to MFH. When assigned to MFH, use loaned hours to ensure all time costs
are collected for duties being performed for MFH. Hours for the ETA method are updated by computer.
NOTE: A cost center can be changed from ETA reporting to ATA reporting if there is a need to collect
and use management information on the work performed by the cost center. For example, during base
recovery after a natural disaster all ETA cost centers will be loaned to the CE grounds element ATA cost
center to perform labor in the recovery efforts.

6.6. Daily Work Schedule. AF Form 561 is used to record the actual hours worked on a weekly basis.
Time is accounted on the daily labor sheet that is attached to the weekly schedule. Increments of less than
0.5 hour are not typically used, but may be used for a more precise pinpointing of time.

6.7. Loaned Labor. Generally, personnel are considered on loan when they work for a cost center other
than the one to which they are assigned and are performing duties typical to the borrowing cost center.
Loan procedures are used for periods involving less than four hours unless it is determined this loan is the
most effective and efficient process to do the work.

6.8. Troop/Donated Labor. When a Reserve team or Air National Guard (ANG) unit comes to a base
and provides assistance, it is the responsibility of the host base to ensure Troop Labor is not used on nor-
mally reimbursable work. When an organization wants to keep track of the total hours spent on BCE
work, but not apply the shop rate to the work order or cost system, a non-BCE personnel record is created
for labor-reporting purposes. As the non-BCE person performs labor, the donated labor hours are accumu-
lated on the work order at no cost.

                                               PLANNING

7.1. Concept.
     7.1.1. Proper planning provides increased productivity and the efficient use of limited resources.
     Planning is defined as a means to determine the scope, method, and type of resources needed to com-
     plete a specific objective. Long-range planning is a responsibility of all civil engineer personnel.
     Operations Flight personnel identify major work requirements, perform periodic design reviews, and
     monitor construction projects to properly identify follow-on operations and maintenance support.
     7.1.2. When a work order is in the planning phase, the chief of planning or shop supervisor will assign
     the work order to a planning technician to finalize the plan. The planner will prepare the job phase
     sheets and task sequences, provide drawings, prepare the BOM, and coordinate the work order plan
     with the appropriate shop supervisor. The shop supervisor will initial the AF Form 327 once any dis-
     agreements have been resolved; the planning function then sends the work order back to the CSU.

7.2. Planning and Estimating. EPS is the most common method used to develop standard-hour esti-
mates. Locally developed standards, owner manuals, and other methods are also used to provide realistic
and manageable estimates.
     7.2.1. Material and Equipment Requirements. Identify all material and equipment requirements for
     individual work orders.
     7.2.2. Special Precautionary Planning. Use AF Form 103 as described in paragraph 5.5.

                                              LOGISTICS

8.1. Concept. One method of requisitioning most material needed for civil engineering in-house work is
by using AF Form 1445. Another method is to use the computerized Civil Engineer Material Acquisition
System (CEMAS). No matter what the method of requisition, a BOM is prepared to identify and order all
civil engineer materials using a set format. CE cannot complete work requirements without materials, so
materials must be requisitioned in a systematic manner. If your organization uses IWIMS, you must have
CEMAS user rights added to your IWIMS user identification to perform any functions in CEMAS. The
chief of logistics is the authority for CEMAS user rights.

8.2. Interrelated Logistics Support. The logistics section is the primary focal point for material require-
ments. The type of support provided is based on the needs of the CE organization and MAJCOM policy.
Some types of logistics support are as follows:
   8.2.1. CEMAS. This is a computerized system used for identifying, acquiring, and controlling mate-
   rial requirements.
   8.2.2. Government-Operated Civil Engineering Supply Store (GOCESS). This is a civil engineering
   system set up to purchase, receive, maintain, and issue material from within the CE organization.
   8.2.3. Contractor-Operated Civil Engineering Supply Store (COCESS). This type of logistics support
   operates under a contract and requires the base to purchase items through a contractor.
   8.2.4. Logistics Civil Engineering Support (LOGCES). This system will only be used by Air Educa-
   tion and Training Command (AETC) BCEs, Supply Squadron, and base contract organizations.
   8.2.5. Standard Base Supply System (SBSS). The Chief of Supply is responsible for the acquisition
   and management of materials at a base.
   8.2.6. Shop Stock. These are materials kept in the cost center and used daily for work requirements.
   These materials are normally kept on DIN trucks for emergency or urgent minor maintenance and
   repair work.
   8.2.7. Centralized Bench Stock. This material is normally kept in the logistics section and is a consol-
   idated supply of material that more than one cost center may use.
   8.2.8. Decentralized Bench Stock. This is a supply of material authorized by the logistics section to be
   maintained in the cost center.
   8.2.9. Residue. This is material left over after a work requirement is complete or canceled. It may also
   include excess material located in the cost centers. All residue items should be turned in to the logis-
   tics section for proper processing.

8.3. Material Support. The CE organization performs maintenance, repair, and construction work on
Air Force installations. If CE cannot acquire the proper material to accomplish a work requirement then
the work cannot be done, so the logistics section must receive the order forms (AF Form 1445, AF Form
2005, and BOM). The RDD must be on the forms. The RDD to let the logistics section know when the
materials are needed. The logistics section is the primary focal point for material requirements within the
CE organization.

     8.3.1. DSW Material Support. If materials are required for a DSW, the necessary material ordering
     forms are prepared manually or with the IWIMS. When the material ordering forms are ready to go to
     the logistics section, the RDD is entered and the material ordering forms are forwarded. Once the
     logistics section receives the materials, the work requirement is scheduled for accomplishment.
     8.3.2. Planned Work Order Material Support. The planning function normally prepares ordering
     forms for planned work orders. Once a planned work order is approved, the material is ordered, the
     RDD is entered, and the forms sent to the logistics section. The RDD for planned work orders should
     be 45 days before the estimated start date of the work. After all work order materials are obtained, the
     planned work order is programmed and scheduled for accomplishment.

                                               Chapter 9

                             RECURRING WORK PROGRAM (RWP)

9.1. Concept. The RWP is designed to provide CE with an easy-to-update automated program for pre-
ventative maintenance activities. It is used to identify recurring maintenance actions to support critical
equipment and minimize repair and replacement costs. Effective use of the RWP is critical for minimizing
the number of DSWs. Operations management personnel must ensure that the shops have a program
established. The shops provide the maintenance action sheets (MAS) and RWP records; however opera-
tions management will give computer assistance as needed, and may also give advice as to how the pro-
gram should be established and what types of items might be included in the RWP. The RWP can also be
used as a management tool to identify permanently deferred actions due to lack of manpower, as well as
programming hours to support the ongoing work.
   9.1.1. Remember that the craftsmen are the experts, and operations management is there to give
   non-technical advice.
   9.1.2. Operations management should confer with each foreman to discuss what to put in the pro-
   gram. Remember that the RWP must be cost-effective. When cost versus maintenance is no longer
   practical, it may become cost-effective to replace the unit.
   9.1.3. Manning will be an issue concerning RWP. The foreman will decide what is and is not critical.
   Once non-critical items have been identified, they are “permanently deferred”; the item has been iden-
   tified as an item that should be done, but cannot be. The “Rec Type/Stat” block will be marked “H”.

9.2. RWP Summary Report. Operations management can use the RWP summary report to measure the
shop’s RWP performance. This information is available from the “Summary” report in the RWP menu.
The following gives a brief description of the columns within the summary report. NOTE: Be sure you
change the week ending date to the week you desire or the report will produce the data from the previous
week by default.
   9.2.1. Total Items Due. This is the total number of items that were on the RWP schedule for the week
   ending. The remaining numbers should be equal to this number.
   9.2.2. Number Scheduled: This is the number of items that were scheduled for the week ending. If
   these items were not completed, not charged, or not deferred, they will appear as overdue on the next
   week’s schedule.
   9.2.3. Number Complete. This indicates the number of items completed by the end of that week.
   9.2.4. Number Working. This indicates the number of items with time charged to them but not com-
   pleted.
   9.2.5. Number Overdue. This is the number of items that are overdue for the week ending.
   9.2.6. Number Deferred. These are items deferred during the week ending date. NOTE: Items
   deferred will not be scheduled until the next date scheduled.
       9.2.6.1. Defer Manhr. This indicates the number of items that were deferred due to lack of
       man-hours.
28                                                                  AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


        9.2.6.2. Defer Access. This indicates the number of items that were deferred due to the lack of
        access.
        9.2.6.3. Defer Matls. This indicates the number of items that were deferred due to lack of materi-
        als.
        9.2.6.4. Defer Other. This is the number of items that were deferred for reasons other than those
        listed.

9.3. Contingency RWP. RWP is just as important in the field as it is at the main base, but will most
likely be smaller. An MAS may be written on a piece of paper or created in a word processor. IWIMS or
ACES are not available under field conditions, so locally developed procedures will have to be used.

9.4. RWP Schedule. To run the RWP schedule, select the RWP menu from the IWIMS menu screen and
press PF3.
     9.4.1. The IWIMS RWP is designed to perform at certain intervals, with the required materials and
     man-hours associated with each task. The RWP establishes a schedule of actions due to be performed
     during the current and next week. This schedule is automatically maintained by the labor reporting
     process. Man-hours are identified and reserved at the shop level.
     9.4.2. The shop is responsible for developing the MAS used to identify required tasks and hours as
     outlined in AFI 32-1001, paragraph 10; however, a working knowledge of the RWP program is
     encouraged.

                                               Chapter 10

                       COLLECTION WORK ORDER NUMBERS (CWON)

10.1. Concept. The CWON system is a series of work order numbers that collect costs. DOD directives
(DOD 7000.14-R, DOD Financial Management Regulations; DOD Instruction [DODI] 7040.4, Military
Construction, Authorization and Appropriation; DODI 4150.7, DOD Pest Management Program; DOD
Directive [DODD] 4001.1, Installation Management; DODD 4165.6, Real Property Acquisition, Man-
agement, and Disposal) require real property maintenance activities to collect hours and financial data, by
account code, for all work completed. The CWON system minimizes administrative tasks required to
accumulate labor hours and financial data for repetitive work completed by ATA shops. A CWON is also
used to authorize certain repetitive type work charged to LUC 11 (entomology services, refuse collection,
custodial services, and engineering and environmental planning) and LUC 19 (operations of utility
plants). The CWON system helps to attain the following results:
   10.1.1. Cost-effective property maintenance.
   10.1.2. Maintenance of active and inactive real property.
   10.1.3. Tracking work hours expended on maintenance and repair.
   10.1.4. Maximize customer service.
   10.1.5. Fast and simple system for minor work requirements.
   10.1.6. Minimize customer paperwork.
   10.1.7. Ensures timeliness of work requests.

10.2. Reserved CWONs. CWONs 00001 through 00020 are reserved for Air Force use as described in
AFI 32-1001, Attachment 2.

10.3. Uses for CWONs. CWONs are used to collect charges for work authorized on AF Form 1219 or by
DSW. The CWON list is used to authorize all work done by the Engineering Flight and Environmental
Flight except:
   10.3.1. Work on military construction projects for element of expense identification code (EEIC)
   321- (greater than $1.5 million, inside the continental United States [CONUS], and funded by Con-
   gress) and 331-funded (greater than $1.5 million, outside CONUS, and funded by Congress) projects
   when the Air Force is the design agent.
   10.3.2. Work on MFH projects when the design costs are reimbursable (cost account codes 71XXX
   [construction] and 72XXX [maintenance, repair, operations]).
   10.3.3. Contract work done by architectural and engineering firms for the Air Force.
   10.3.4. Work chargeable to utility operations, except contract work for utility services or purchased
   utilities.
   10.3.5. Work chargeable to entomology, custodial, and refuse collection, except when done by con-
   tract.
   10.3.6. Operations-type work, such as grass cutting, cleaning storm drains, and pavement cleaning.
30                                                                    AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


10.4. CWON Collection. CWONs are also used to collect time, material, and other financial data for all
work authorized by DSW and recurring work. They collect maintenance costs of individual utility plants
and systems if required for computing utility sales rates.

10.5. CWON Validation. The CWON list is reviewed and validated annually by the chief of operations
management and updated, modified, or deleted as necessary. A separate CWON is set up to collect costs
for reimbursable work done by BCE on a repetitive basis for reimbursing activities, such as heating, ven-
tilation, air conditioning (HVAC), the commissary, entomology services, sweeping MFH streets, or
grounds maintenance in a hospital compound.
     10.5.1. CWON List Setup.
        10.5.1.1. Each year before 1 October, operations management and financial management will
        assign the CWONS.
        10.5.1.2. Select all account codes that apply to the installation and list them in numerical
        sequence. Do not include account codes for ETA cost centers.
        10.5.1.3. Select facilities within each account code that may require separate accounting. Assign
        a separate CWON to these facilities only if necessary to recover reimbursement for work.
        10.5.1.4. Select reimbursement and refund services and customers, such as MFH, medical activi-
        ties, and the depot maintenance activity group (DMAG). These require RRI codes and separate
        CWONs.
        10.5.1.5. Select repetitive operations and recurring work such as operation of utility plants, refuse
        collection, and engineering and environmental planning, and assign a separate CWON to each.
        10.5.1.6. Assign CWONs to the remaining account codes. A block of numbers (such as 00021 to
        15000) should be reserved to simplify creation of the CWON list.
        10.5.1.7. Identify the shops authorized to perform work in each of the above and ensure the shop
        is properly added to the CWON record.
     10.5.2. CWON List Review. When the CWON list is complete, it will be reviewed by financial man-
     agement and operations management to ensure separate CWONs are identified for each selected facil-
     ity or service. Operations management will execute the add, delete, and change transactions to update
     the work order register and the shops. Financial management will update the account codes, cross-ref-
     erence the files for add, delete, and change transactions, and verify the facility cost files.

10.6. Final Review and Distribution.
     10.6.1. After all transactions are completed send the CWON to the chief of operations for the approv-
     ing signature.
     10.6.2. Upon approval, operations management will reproduce the listing and give one copy to:
        10.6.2.1. Each scheduler.

                                                 Chapter 11

                FACILITY MANAGER (FM) PROGRAM AND RESPONSIBILITIES

11.1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the FM program and the FM’s
responsibilities. For further guidance see AFPAM 32-1004, Volume 3, Chapter 2.3.

11.2. Unit Commander’s Responsibilities.
     11.2.1. The unit commander will designate in writing an officer, E-4 and above, or civilian equivalent,
     as primary and alternate FMs for each facility assigned to the organization. In multipurpose facilities,
     the major user should be assigned as the primary FM. Any other organization using a portion of a mul-
     tipurpose facility is allowed to appoint an alternate FM for its area. Alternates can process actions
     with CE, but should coordinate with the primary FM.
     11.2.2. The unit commander will ensure alterations, additions, or new construction is not done with-
     out BCE approval, or wing approval if required. BCE approves all work in real property facilities,
     regardless of the method used; therefore, work that will be done using an AF Form 9, International
     Merchant Purchase Authorization Card (IMPAC) purchase, or Simplified Acquisition of Base Engi-
     neer Requirements (SABER) will require BCE approval.
     11.2.3. Unit commanders will ensure no change is made in the use of real property without the
     approval of the FUB.
     11.2.4. Unit commanders must ensure real property and RPIE are not removed, relocated, altered, or
     otherwise changed without prior approval from the BCE.
     11.2.5. Unit commanders will ensure vacated buildings are left in a clean undamaged condition
     (except for fair wear and tear), and adjacent grounds have been properly policed, until transferred
     back to the BCE.

11.3. FM’s Responsibilities. The FM will:
     11.3.1. Establish and publish rules for the opening, use, and closing of the building/facility during
     duty hours and for admittance or use during non-duty hours.
     11.3.2. Ensure security measures are observed.
     11.3.3. Establish procedures to ensure lights not in use are turned off and that heating or air condition-
     ing temperature settings adhere to utility conservation standards.
     11.3.4. Establish a daily policing and grounds inspection around the building/facility.
     11.3.5. Ensure that users of real property facilities do not tamper with, replace, repair, or adjust RPIE,
     including electrical equipment, thermostats, heating and ventilating equipment, air conditioners,
     vents, blowers, fixtures, or other installed equipment. FMs will also ensure that real property and
     RPIE is not removed, altered, relocated, modified, or changed without BCE approval.
     11.3.6. Establish procedures to immediately notify customer service when emergencies occur that
     involve the building or facility and its supporting utility systems.
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                               33


   11.3.7. Brief occupants/users of the building or facility on their collective responsibility for the care,
   custody, and protection of the property, including pecuniary liability for loss and damage in excess of
   fair wear and tear.

11.4. Minor Maintenance, Pest Control, and Housekeeping Duties. The FM should implement these
duties on a routine basis. It is necessary to perform frequent checks to eradicate pests before they are able
to do serious damage to government facilities.
   11.4.1. Inspect janitorial service work daily or as frequently as service is provided, and report any
   unsatisfactory work to the quality assurance evaluator (QAE). A statement of work, frequency of
   cleaning, and area to be serviced will be given to each FM by the BCE.
   11.4.2. Inspect assigned buildings or facilities and RPIE at least monthly. Check the overall condition
   of the property, as well as doors, windows, lights, plumbing, and HVAC equipment. Enter adverse
   conditions or items in need of routine repair or maintenance on AF Form 1219, and hold for the next
   facility walk-through with facility maintenance section personnel.
   11.4.3. Multi-craft repair teams from the facility maintenance section will periodically inspect
   selected facilities for work requirements identified by the FM on an AF Form 1219. During the visit,
   the team will also perform periodic maintenance to the facility’s electrical, HVAC, and fire detection
   or suppression systems if required.
   11.4.4. FMs are expected to make minor repairs (e.g., plunge stopped-up sinks or toilets, repair small
   holes in drywall, glue loose wallpaper, change light bulbs). Lights above 3 meters (10 feet) will be
   changed by the BCE; lights lower than 3 meters are the responsibility of the FM. The FM is expected
   to keep the facility’s equipment, appliances, and premises in the state of repair expected of any prop-
   erty owner.
   11.4.5. Immediately report any damage to or loss of real property, including equipment. Assist with
   determining the cause of loss and assist in determining liability. When necessary, the FM will assist in
   preparing a statement of charges or a report of survey for damages to the building or facility and RPIE.
   11.4.6. The FM is responsible for controlling the following pests: cockroaches, ants other than car-
   penter ants, centipedes, crickets, earwigs, firebrats, flies, silverfish, sow bugs, mice, and miscella-
   neous flying and crawling insects that do not destroy Air Force property. This responsibility also
   includes minor infestations of fire ants, wasps, and wasp nests.
   11.4.7. Controlling insects that attack indoor plants, flowerbeds, and other ornamental plants that
   were not planted by the BCE or other base organizations is also the responsibility of the FM.
   11.4.8. Pesticides and mice traps are available at the base self-help store or in the pest management
   section. The methods provided by self-help must be used for 30 days before the BCE will respond.
   The FM must be able to show that self-help methods were used. If no evidence is found that self-help
   measures were used, the BCE pest management section will ask the FM to first use self-help; the BCE
   will return in 30 days if the problem persists.
   11.4.9. The pest management section will control pests that are significant health hazards, such as
   bees and ground-nesting wasps. Infestations that cause damage to Air Force property will also be con-
   trolled by CE, including termites, carpenter ants, and wood-boring beetles.
34                                                                      AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


11.5. Space Utilization and Key Control. The FM will acknowledge receipts and responsibility for all
keys to a building, including the redistribution of keys to other occupants or users as directed by the com-
mander. The FM may request duplicated keys, re-keying, or lock changes as necessary on an
AF Form 332. If a locksmith service is not available at the base, the AF 332 may be processed through CE
for accomplishment by contract. Keys must be returned to the FM when the holders are reassigned or no
longer employed.
     11.5.1. Monitor the assigned space of a user organization to ensure its use is in compliance with the
     FUB’s approval, and report any change in use, change of occupant, or vacant space to the real estate
     management office.
     11.5.2. When a facility is vacated ensure that it is clean, orderly, and secured to prevent unauthorized
     entry. Tag all keys and return them to the CE real estate management office.

11.6. Grounds Maintenance. The FM will ensure the facility’s grounds are maintained according to
standards. Any discrepancies must be reported to operations management to write a DSW for accomplish-
ment.

11.7. Custodial Services. Monitoring and or reporting custodial service requirements or discrepancies is
the responsibility of the FM. Any discrepancies must be reported to the custodial QAE.

11.8. Digging Permits. Disturbance of earth deeper than 100 millimeters (4 inches) requires a digging
permit (AF Form 103). This permit is initiated through the BCE’s engineering assistants. If this require-
ment is ignored and damages are incurred, all costs for repairs will be charged to the responsible party.

11.9. Training Development. Operations management (or other CE office as designated by the BCE) is
responsible for the FM training program. Each Air Force installation should develop a comprehensive FM
guide encompassing all aspects of CE operations and FM responsibilities.

11.10. Work Identification.
     11.10.1. There are several methods that the FM can use to identify work to the BCE:
        11.10.1.1. Call customer service if the work is an emergency or urgent.
        11.10.1.2. Identify work on an AF Form 1219.
        11.10.1.3. Submit an AF Form 332.
     11.10.2. Emergency Work. A job is considered an emergency if there is an interruption of utilities,
     immediate danger to human life, or there is a possibility of damage to the facility’s infrastructure.
     Anyone identifying an emergency can call CE customer service directly. The caller is responsible for
     briefing their FM. CE customer service or night service call will issue a DSW order number and a
     craftsman will respond within 24 hours.
     11.10.3. Urgent Work. A job is considered urgent if there is a non-emergency condition, including,
     but not limited to, a stopped-up toilet when others are available, no heat in a single room, or air condi-
     tioning inoperative in a single room. The FM will make urgent requests and CE customer service will
     make the final determination as to whether or not the requirement is urgent. BCE will respond to
     urgent conditions within five duty days.
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                               35


   11.10.4. Routine Work. A DSW that is not an emergency or urgent is classified as routine. Routine
   job orders do not require detailed planning and can be sent to the shop as a DSW. Routine work has a
   30-day commitment. Routine work may be requested on an AF Form 332, identified on an AF Form
   1219, or by calling CE customer service.
   11.10.5. The FM will maintain an AF Form 1219 to identify initial minor repairs of a non-emergency
   nature. Additional work will be identified on a walk-through inspection between the FM and an
   inspector from the facility maintenance section. After this inspection, the work will be scheduled for
   accomplishment.

11.11. Submitting a Work Request. An AF Form 332 is used to identify work that will require detailed
planning, such as renovation, major repair work, new work, or replacement of real property such as heat-
ing systems, air conditioning systems, and ventilation systems. It is also used to identify paint requests,
tree trimming, sign requests, and key requests.
   11.11.1. The FM should submit a sketch, diagram, or map attached to the AF Form 332, that will
   speed the process of understanding the requester’s needs. An original and three copies of AF Form
   332 will be prepared. The customer will receive the customer copy, with a request number, after it has
   been submitted. For further guidance on processing an AF Form 332, see AFPAM 32-1004, Volume
   3, Chapter 2.2.
   11.11.2. The commander should sign any request for new work, facility modification, or minor con-
   struction; however, the FM may sign other requests. Anyone may request work on an
   AF Form 332, but it must be coordinated through the FM. The FM will coordinate in block 14 or sign
   the request in block 13. All AF Form 332s must be coordinated through the base safety, bioenviron-
   mental, and environmental management organizations, and the base fire department. The requester or
   FM may hand-carry the AF Form 332 to each of these organizations or drop it off at CE customer ser-
   vice.
   11.11.3. When CE customer service has received the AF Form 332, a number will be issued and the
   customer’s copy will be returned to the requester. If the work does not require detailed planning, the
   request will be immediately scheduled with the appropriate shop. Work that will require detailed plan-
   ning will be processed according to local base procedures (see AFPAM 32-1004, Volume 3, Chapter
   2.2).

11.12. Carpet Requests. Carpet installation requests must be submitted to the BCE using an
AF Form 332 processed as outlined in paragraphs 11.11. through 11.11.3.

11.13. Fire Prevention and Inspections. The fire prevention program is set up and maintained to ensure
fire safety in all buildings. This is done through education and training of all personnel assigned to base
facilities. FMs have a broad range of responsibilities to fulfill to achieve these goals. The items listed in
this section are intended to give a more comprehensive scope of the responsibility that comes with being
designated an FM.
   11.13.1. The FM is the point of contact (POC) for all fire-related issues within their facility; as such,
   they are required to accompany fire inspectors during all inspections. If this is not possible, then a
   qualified substitute must be appointed.
36                                                                    AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


        11.13.1.1. Correct any hazard or deficiency promptly. Hazards or deficiencies can be corrected on
        the spot or by submitting an AF Form 332 for self-help or BCE assistance.
        11.13.1.2. When hazards and deficiencies are noted that cannot be corrected on the spot, an
        AF Form 1487, Fire Prevention Visit Report, should be issued. Note the suspense date and coor-
        dinate corrective action through the commander to get the AF Form 1487 returned on time. Your
        commander will be notified of any AF Form 1487 that does not meet the assigned suspense date.
     11.13.2. Make weekly fire safety inspections, checking fire extinguishers, installed fire protection
     systems, emergency lights, exit lights, and housekeeping practices. Pay particular attention to the use
     of extension cords, restricted hallways or blocked exits, and storage of flammables. Power down elec-
     trical equipment if it will be unattended or not used for an extended period.
        11.13.2.1. Outside housekeeping is often overlooked. Keep fire lanes and hydrants unobstructed
        and accessible; during the winter months this may also mean snow removal. Refer to the local
        operations plan (OPLAN) as it may limit smoking to authorized areas only.
        11.13.2.2. Perform monthly inspections of fire extinguishers and document the results (e.g., tags
        on the extinguisher, notebook, electronic files). Keep a folder to track extinguisher inspections,
        work orders, visit reports (hood and duct cleaning and deep fat fryer thermostat calibration, where
        applicable), training, or other necessary documentation. Local base fire protection documentation
        is required reading for FMs and provides excellent guidance for walk-through inspections.
     11.13.3. Train all personnel working in the facility on reporting fire procedures, the location and use
     of fire extinguishers and alarm pull-boxes, as well as emergency evacuation procedures. If there are
     any questions concerning fire safety, contact the base fire department.
        11.13.3.1. Post emergency reporting numbers on all phones.
        11.13.3.2. Conduct a walk-through at the close of business each day to ensure the work area is
        fire-safe. This task can be delegated to trained personnel who are on duty at closing time.

11.14. Bioenvironmental Engineering Services (BES).
     11.14.1. OSHA's Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) Standard. HAZCOM was established to
     ensure workers are trained on the chemical hazards in their work environment. It consists of three ele-
     ments that require action by supervisors: a written program, labeling of chemicals, and training.
        11.14.1.1. Written Program. The written program includes establishing a 3-ring binder with Air
        Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) 161-21, Hazard Communication Program, and
        local operating procedures, the work area’s listing of chemicals, material safety data sheets
        (MSDS) for each chemical, and operating instructions (OI) on non-routine tasks. These items
        must be maintained in the work area where the chemicals are used.
        11.14.1.2. Labeling of Chemicals. Manufacturers must label their products to include the identity,
        hazard warnings, and name and address of the manufacturer. Secondary containers or containers
        with unreadable markings must be labeled.
        11.14.1.3. Training. Training is required for supervisors and workers. Military public health
        (MPH) administers the initial HAZCOM training. Supervisors must conduct work-area-specific
        training at least annually, any time a new hazard is introduced into the work area, and when new
        workers begin employment. Training must be documented on AF Form 55, Employee Safety and
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                            37


       Health Record, or equivalent. Work area training must include the HAZCOM program, chemical
       hazard and control measures in the work area, and instruction on the use of an MSDS.
   11.14.2. Lead Paint and Asbestos. Lead paint can be an ingestion and inhalation hazard and asbestos
   can be an inhalation hazard. If an employee notices paint or insulation material in poor repair or the
   employees cannot perform their work without disturbing the paint or materials, they must notify the
   BES function and complete an AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report, and AF Form 332. BES is
   available to perform sampling and analysis to confirm the presence of lead or asbestos.

11.15. Environmental Management. With the increasing amount of environmental issues affecting
human health and the environment, the Environmental Flight is the focal point for all environmental
issues on base. Below is a general overview of what each section within the Environmental Flight may be
responsible for, though all these sections may not exist at every base.
   11.15.1. The environmental compliance section oversees environmental regulatory laws at the Fed-
   eral, state, and local level while addressing overall environmental quality objectives and comparing
   environmental risk across programs. It also incorporates a planning element that is responsible for
   evaluating and assessing current and future operations, procedures, and processes as they relate to the
   National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Air Force program that addresses NEPA is the Envi-
   ronmental Impact Analysis Program (EIAP). These processes function as a working group to review
   work orders, identify discrepancies, and develop plans to correct deficiencies. Training is provided to
   base employees and residents to enhance environmental awareness and increase knowledge and
   expertise.
   11.15.2. The environmental restoration section administers the Installation Restoration Program. This
   element is responsible for identifying sites that were environmentally contaminated from past prac-
   tices and implementing proper remedial actions for restoring sites.
   11.15.3. The natural and cultural resources section establishes, coordinates, and maintains the Natural
   Resources Management Program in compliance with local, state, and Federal agencies. This program
   encompasses the management of forests, horticulture, fish, wildlife, and landscaping activities. This
   element also integrates historical and archeological preservation requirements through extensive plan-
   ning and management while encouraging rehabilitation and adaptive use of significant historical
   resources.
   11.15.4. The pollution prevention section uses proactive measures to decrease hazardous material
   purchases and reduce hazardous waste and solid waste disposal through minimization and recycling.
   In an effort to achieve success in pollution prevention, the Hazardous Material Pharmacy
   (HAZMART) monitors and approves all hazardous material purchased on base or through local
   IMPAC purchases. Another pollution prevention initiative is an active recycling program.

11.16. Contract Services. Contract services are available at each base and for each facility but operation
procedures may vary. The FM should contact the Maintenance Engineering Flight for further guidance.
   11.16.1. Custodial Contract Services. Contact the Maintenance Engineering flight for information on
   services offered at your local installation.
   11.16.2. Grounds/Contract Maintenance Services (Grass Cutting/Snow Removal). These services
   ensure grounds are maintained according to local base standards. Maintenance includes policing the
   area, ensuring sidewalks are kept clear and swept, and parking instructions are enforced. General
38                                                                      AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


     upkeep and cleanliness of the grounds surrounding the building, to include streets, is the FM’s respon-
     sibility.
        11.16.2.1. Snow removal contract work does not include all facilities, sidewalks, and parking lots.
        It is the FM’s responsibility to have a shovel and ice-melt (available at the self-help center) to
        ensure immediate pathways are clear and not slippery. Contact CE customer service for snow
        removal information for your installation.
        11.16.2.2. Grounds maintenance questions should be directed to CE customer service.
     11.16.3. Asbestos/Lead Paint Contract Services. FMs must be aware of asbestos and lead health haz-
     ards if the facility has been identified as having these health hazards; concerns or questions should be
     directed to CE customer service or the Environmental Flight.
     11.16.4. Paint Contract Services. Contact the Maintenance Engineering Flight for further guidance
     concerning the local procedures for paint contract services.
        11.16.4.1. The FM must submit an AF Form 332 to CE customer service before performing
        self-help work that requires a purchase request or an IMPAC purchase. New work must be
        reviewed for clearance and evaluation of facilities for lead-based paint hazards in accordance with
        state and Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations.
        11.16.4.2. No paint requirements will be accomplished until approval has been granted by the
        BCE.
     11.16.5. Washer/Dryer Contract Services. Before calling the QAE for service, it is the FM's responsi-
     bility to check the circuit breakers to ensure they are not tripped, and that the appliance is plugged in,
     water is turned on (where applicable), and the inlet screens are clean on the washer hoses. Washer or
     dryer questions or calls should be directed to the QAE if the above steps have been taken and the prob-
     lem could not be resolved.
     11.16.6. Refuse Contract Services. The FM should contact the Maintenance Engineering Flight for
     information concerning refuse services.

                                    IWIMS REPORT UTILITY

12.1. Concept. IWIMS is used to track data from real property and base-level CE work orders, to logis-
tics management and fire department information, and military construction projects, to environmental
and readiness information. Functions covered in this pamphlet include the ability of IWIMS to initiate
DSWs (paragraph 3.2.), assigning work request numbers (paragraph 4.7.2.), and running RWP schedules
(paragraph 9.4.). The tool most often used to extract and organize this information is the IWIMS Report
Utility. Visit the Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA) Web site at
http://www.afcesa.af.mil/directorate/ceo/management/operations/writing%20reports.doc for
step-by-step instructions on writing, modifying, and printing reports in IWIMS.

                                         VEHICLE CONTROL

13.1. VCO Designation.
     13.1.1. The first step in establishing a vehicle control program to meet Air Force vehicle management
     goals is by the appointment of a vehicle control officer (VCO) and vehicle control noncommissioned
     officer (VCNCO). In accordance with AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, the unit commander or civil-
     ian equivalent is charged with the responsibility of appointing a primary and alternate VCO. The VCO
     is the commander's designated liaison with the Transportation Squadron. After the commander has
     selected the candidates, an appointment letter must be submitted to the Transportation Squadron’s
     fleet management office (Figure 13.1.). Upon receipt, the fleet management office will schedule the
     person for training. Appointed individuals should have a minimum retainability of one year.
     13.1.2. A new VCO/VCNCO must be appointed no later than 30 days before the current individual's
     permanent change of station (PCS), retirement, or separation. The current VCO/VCNCO cannot be
     relieved of their duties until the new representative has been fully trained.

13.3. Required Government Instructions. Listed below are the current instructions that will help you
in your position as a VCO/VCNCO; they must be available for your use.
     13.3.1. AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations.
     13.3.2. AFI 24-302, Vehicle Maintenance Management.
     13.3.3. AFI 24-307, Procedures for Vehicle Maintenance Management.
     13.3.4. AFMAN 24-306, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Driver.
     13.3.5. Local base VCO handbook.
     13.3.6. AFPAM 24-317, Vehicle Control.

13.4. Government Owned Vehicles (GOV).
     13.4.1. Public Law. In accordance with AFI 24-301, Chapter 2, official use of GOVs is defined to
     restrict the use of all DOD motor vehicles, including those rented or leased, to official purposes only.
        13.4.1.1. Providing a GOV solely or even principally to enhance the comfort or convenience of a
        member is not permitted.
        13.4.1.2. Misuse and or failure to prevent misuse of government-owned or -leased vehicles are
        punishable under Title 31, United States Code (USC), Money and Finance, Section 1349. The
        unauthorized or willful misuse of a GOV may be cause for the following disciplinary actions:
            13.4.1.2.1. Military personnel are subject to disciplinary action under provisions of the Uni-
            form Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) or other administrative procedures.
            13.4.1.2.2. Civilian personnel are subject to suspension from duty, without pay, for not less
            than one month, and will be suspended for a longer period or summarily removed from office
            if circumstances warrant.
     13.4.2. Questions on Official Use of GOV.
        13.4.2.1. When questions arise about official use of GOVs, they must be resolved in favor of strict
        compliance with statutory provisions and polices of the instructions. When guidance does not spe-
        cifically fit a request for transportation support, commanders will use the following factors when
        making official-use determinations:
            13.4.2.1.1. Is the purpose of the trip official?
            13.4.2.1.2. Does the request have the potential to create a perception that will reflect unfavor-
            ably on the Air Force or cause criticism?
            13.4.2.1.3. Will the request have an impact on mission requirements?
            13.4.2.1.4. Is commercial or DOD-scheduled transportation available? It is important to note
            that the Air Force does not provide transportation support that competes with commercial ser-
            vices.
        13.4.2.2. For more information on official use of GOVs and authorized uses see AFI 24-301,
        Chapter 2.
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                             43


13.5. Permissible Operating Distance (POD). POD is a distance in a given direction to which an activ-
ity normally dispatches administrative-use vehicles. A distance of 75 miles one-way is considered the
normal POD (see Department of Defense Directive [DODD] 4500.9, Transportation and Traffic Manage-
ment). The Transportation Squadron will determine the POD for the base. Any unit needing to exceed the
POD must submit a request through the Transportation Squadron’s chief dispatcher. Depending on the
base’s requirements, when unit vehicles are dispatched off the base the vehicle may need to be equipped
with an emergency highway warning kit. This kit should contain the following: spare tire and wheel, jack,
lug wrench, and road flares or reflectors. Additionally, when a request to exceed the POD is made, a trip
packet should be requested from the Transportation Squadron.

13.6. Obtaining Unit Vehicles. Federal law controls the purchase of passenger-carrying vehicles for
government use. Through the Appropriations Act, Congress sets statutory price limits for purchasing
vehicles.
   13.6.1. Tables of Allowance (TA) 019 through 033 prescribe the maximum allowances (not authori-
   zations) to accomplish organizational and functional missions.
   13.6.2. Requests for vehicle authorizations must be completed according to the Transportation
   Squadron’s requirements. Figure 13.2. shows a sample of a vehicle justification letter. Each item must
   be addressed individually. Disregard items that do not apply to your requested vehicle (i.e., forklifts/
   tugs only). References to maintenance downtime or backup vehicles are not valid justifications for an
   authorization. When a basis of issue (BOI) covers multiple vehicle types, it means more than one
   vehicle type may be authorized for that BOI. Any technical data or other pertinent information
   required to substantiate the request should be included. The more information included, the better.
   Any justification not submitted according to the example will be returned.
44                                                                    AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004

  13.6.3. After justification is submitted to the Transportation Squadron, the fleet management office
  must be able to answer the following questions as part of an authorization analysis:
     13.6.3.1. Is the vehicle type requested the most suitable to perform the task, or can a smaller, more
     fuel-efficient vehicle do the same job?
     13.6.3.2. Can the requester be furnished with another source of transportation without using an
     additional authorization?
     13.6.3.3. Is there a lower priority vehicle available to fill the requested authorization?
     13.6.3.4. How has this requirement been supported in the past, and why can’t the present support
     continue?
     13.6.3.5. How are presently assigned vehicles used?
     13.6.3.6. Can this requirement be satisfied within the organization or with another organization?
     13.6.3.7. Is the requirement seasonal or sporadic? Can it be satisfied by a short-term lease or
     rental to avoid investing in a new vehicle?
  13.6.4. Other questions the fleet management office must be able to answer in the affirmative before
  forwarding the request to Headquarters Air Force Special Operations Command, Vehicle Manage-
  ment (HQ AFSOC/LGTV) are as follows:
     13.6.4.1. Does the justification indicate the current vehicle authorization listing using activity or
     the proposed user?
     13.6.4.2. Does the justification cite the directive, project, or publication that generated the
     request, if appropriate?
     13.6.4.3. Does the justification fully explain the proposed use of the vehicle?
     13.6.4.4. Does the justification identify expected utilization information (miles, hours, passen-
     gers, equipment, supplies, materials, and number of trips)?
     13.6.4.5. Does the justification list the number of vehicles currently authorized and assigned to
     the requesting unit and justify why co-utilization will not meet mission requirements?
     13.6.4.6. Does the request justify why transportation support from the Vehicle Operations Flight
     cannot satisfy the requirement?
     13.6.4.7. Does the justification include a mission impact statement of the organization, base, or
     wing if the request is denied?
     13.6.4.8. Does the justification cite any actions taken to realign other unit authorizations to
     accommodate the requirement?
  13.6.5. After the analysis is complete, the Transportation Squadron will make a recommendation and
  forward the request to the Logistics Group (LG) commander through the Transportation Squadron
  commander. The LG will then approve or disapprove the request based on the justification and analy-
  sis. If approved, it will then be forwarded to MAJCOM headquarters for final approval or disapproval.
  If approved, the authorization will be filled at the earliest possible time. Sometimes substitute vehicle
  types will be assigned to assist the unit in meeting mission requirements. Keep in mind that the type
  of vehicle authorized is the type that will be assigned when assets are available.
46                                                                     AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


13.7. Authorized Realignment. Periodically, reviews are conducted for possible authorization realign-
ments or reductions. Units must be prepared to defend their needs if the requirement is still valid.

13.8. Accounting for Unit Vehicles. Periodically, the fleet management office will send the VCO/
VCNCO two computer-generated master vehicle listing/hand receipts. The VCO will need to ensure the
vehicles listed are the vehicles assigned to the unit. If any discrepancies are found, make corrections and
contact the vehicle operator to resolve any errors. If everything is in order, sign both copies, put one in the
VCO files and send the other to the fleet management office to be filed in their records.

13.9. Vehicle Priority-Buy. The fleet management office is responsible for submitting the annual vehi-
cle priority-buy. The submission will identify shortages and vehicles eligible for replacement for host
base vehicles and for all tenant units. The priority-buy is based on vehicle requirements two years in
advance, allowing time for funding by Congress. After the fleet management office compiles the data and
prepares the priority-buy package, it is sent to the MAJCOM headquarters for the tenant unit's command.
The MAJCOM will compile this information and forward it to the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center
(WR-ALC). There the data will be compiled and forwarded to Headquarters, United States Air Force (HQ
USAF) as the recommendation for that fiscal year's purchase requirements. HQ USAF allocates funds to
WR-ALC to purchase vehicles and distribute them to the MAJCOMs, which in turn distribute them to
their bases.
     13.9.1. Short-term Lease. Transportation Squadron commanders may rent or lease vehicles to meet
     peak work loads and unusual or emergency requirements for periods not to exceed one year without
     established authorizations (if the user has funds available). When a rental or lease will exceed 60 days,
     General Service Administration (GSA) vehicles must be used if they are available. The fleet manage-
     ment office will confirm non-availability from GSA before executing a commercial lease exceeding
     60 days for general-purpose vehicles. Lease time frames are subject to local base policies.
     13.9.2. Long-term Lease. Leasing over one year is generally to fill valid authorizations when no GOV
     is available. The fleet management office will obtain a non-availability letter from GSA for commer-
     cial design, general-purpose vehicles and include this statement with the request when it is sent to
     MAJCOM HQ and WR-ALC Vehicle Maintenance Directorate, Item Management Division (LVD)
     for approval. Lease requests for other than commercial design vehicles are sent to the MAJCOM
     Director of Transportation (HQ/LGT) for approval. Written approval must be obtained to extend
     leases past the approval period. Justifications include:
        13.9.2.1. Current authorizations and assets by type to be leased.
        13.9.2.2. Number of vehicles on hand that exceed Air Force standards for age and mileage.
        13.9.2.3. Model year, mileage, and estimated repair cost of the vehicle to be replaced.
        13.9.2.4. Other types of excess vehicles on-hand that are suitable for substitution.
        13.9.2.5. Whether the vehicles are required to fill open authorizations or required to replace exist-
        ing inventories.
        13.9.2.6. Impact or course of action if authority to lease is not granted.
        13.9.2.7. Whether the request is a new or renewal lease.
        13.9.2.8. Monthly and annual cost for the lease, including the basic cost, mileage charges, and
        fuel and maintenance costs.
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                            47


       13.9.2.9. Anticipated period of use.
   13.9.3. Validation. The fleet management office will validate all rentals and leases for installation
   activities. For more information on vehicle rentals and leases see AFI 24-301, Chapter 5.

13.10. Abuse and Misuse. VCOs are responsible to the commander for preventing, reporting, and inves-
tigating vehicle abuse and misuse within the unit. In accordance with AFMAN 24-307, local procedures
are established and must be fully supported by all commanders to be effective.
   13.10.1. Vehicle abuse is any mechanical failure or damage that is not the result of fair wear and tear
   or defective materials or workmanship. The using organization will investigate all damage not appli-
   cable to fair wear and tear in accordance with AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Prop-
   erty. Vehicle maintenance will notify the commander and VCO of the unit involved, along with the
   base legal, finance, and safety offices (usually by a form letter of abuse to a GOV). Vehicle mainte-
   nance will make the repair unless notified by the using organization after a predetermined period of
   time. Some examples of vehicle abuse are:
       13.10.1.1. Tampering with governors.
       13.10.1.2. Running engines at excessive speeds.
       13.10.1.3. Operating a vehicle with insufficient oil or coolant.
       13.10.1.4. Using a vehicle for other than its designed or intended purpose.
       13.10.1.5. Starting and or stopping too fast when not in an emergency.
       13.10.1.6. Not washing or waxing the vehicle.
   13.10.2. Misuse is any unauthorized use of a GOV. A GOV must be used for official purposes only.
   The VOO can give guidance in specific cases where the official nature of the vehicle use is in ques-
   tion. See paragraph 13.4.2. for details on legitimate GOV usage. A witness to suspected vehicle mis-
   use should contact the fleet management office. The fleet management office will need the following
   information to investigate the incident:
       13.10.2.1. Registration number of the vehicle.
       13.10.2.2. Date, time, location, and details of the incident.
       13.10.2.3. POC and duty phone number for any additional questions.

13.11. Accident Reporting and Investigating Procedures. All accidents that involve GOVs must be
reported on SF 91. If the GOV is involved in an accident, the Security Forces Squadron must be con-
tacted. More procedures can be found in AFMAN 24-306, Chapter 10. It is recommended that acci-
dent-reporting procedures be written on a card and placed with the accident cards in the vehicle and the
unit briefed on its location. When a GOV is involved in an accident, the VCO is responsible to report,
document, investigate, and take appropriate actions necessary to prevent reoccurrence within the organi-
zation. Information on investigating accidents can be found in AFI 31-201, Security Police Standards and
Procedures, and AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. It is recommended that a case file be
established for each GOV accident, abuse, or misuse case occurring within the unit. The Transportation
Squadron’s Vehicle Operations Flight can provide guidance on vehicle accident reporting. NOTE: The SF
91 and DD Form 518, Accident Identification Card, must be in the vehicle at all times during operation.
48                                                                    AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


The purpose of the DD Form 518 is to provide persons involved in an accident with a DOD-owned or
-leased vehicle the identity of the person with the authority to act on the matter.
     13.11.1. The following should be placed in the accident investigation file:
        13.11.1.1. Completed SF 91.
        13.11.1.2. Vehicle maintenance work order.
        13.11.1.3. Vehicle release letter (Figure 3.3).
        13.11.1.4. Police report.
        13.11.1.5. Photos of accident damage or abuse.
        13.11.1.6. VCO investigation letter of accident or abuse.
        13.11.1.7. AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value Statement.
        13.11.1.8. Finalized copy of any one of these three reports, if applicable:
            13.11.1.8.1. DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss.
            13.11.1.8.2. DD Form 362, Statement of Charges for Government Property Lost, Dam-
            aged, or Destroyed.
            13.11.1.8.3. DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher.
     13.11.2. If a vehicle is involved in an accident, it must be turned in to vehicle maintenance immedi-
     ately. If the accident occurs after duty hours or on a weekend or holiday, then the vehicle must be
     turned in the next duty day following the accident. This applies even if the vehicle was not damaged.
     Failing to turn a vehicle into vehicle maintenance after an accident can result in vehicle abuse action.
     Vehicle maintenance will determine what is considered vehicle abuse.
     13.11.3. The VCO/VCNCO will release the accident vehicle for repair when the vehicle investigation
     is complete. Vehicle maintenance will make the repairs when the release letter is received. Figure
     13.3. is an example of a release letter. More information on accident causes and reports can be found
     in AFMAN 24-306, Chapter 10.

13.12. Contingency Support.
   13.12.1. Annually, the VCO is tasked to provide the fleet management office with the unit’s minimum
   essential level (MEL) for vehicles (Figure 13.4.). The VOO, superintendent, and vehicle maintenance
   officer/superintendent will review VCO inputs and make their recommendations for the MEL. If their
   recommendations differ from the VCO’s, the VCO will be asked to re-justify the inputs.
   13.12.2. The MEL will enable the VOO to recall lower priority vehicles from units above their MEL
   to satisfy organizational shortages in another unit when the number of vehicles falls below their MEL.
   Revisions to the MEL will be considered throughout the year when necessary to reflect changes in the
   unit's mission or fleet.

13.13. Vehicle Priority Recall List. The vehicle priority recall list is a management tool used to deter-
mine the order in which unit vehicles should be recalled. The list is developed from the data in the MEL
and is used by the Vehicle Operations Flight to replace higher priority vehicles that require extended
maintenance and support emergency operation plans. This information depends on the base recall plan.
When notified of a recall, ensure that vehicles are brought to the fleet management office. Vehicles must
be cleaned, full of fuel, and free of any open discrepancies noted on AF Form 1800, Operator’s Inspec-
tion Guide and Trouble Report (General Purpose Vehicles). The unit VCO must respond within one
hour to recall requirements.

13.14. Deploying Unit Vehicles. When a unit is notified of a pending temporary duty (TDY) assign-
ment, the VCO/VCNCO will notify the fleet management office of the following information to allow
vehicle maintenance to track the vehicle:
     13.14.1. Tasking authority for the deployment.
     13.14.2. Type of vehicle to deploy and registration number.
     13.14.3. Date due to depart.
     13.14.4. Date due to return.
     13.14.5. Location (unless classified).

13.15. Transportation Support Services. The Vehicle Operations Flight’s vehicle dispatch section is a
service organization with an array of support services that can assist the unit in meeting mission require-
ments. Listed below are some of the services available that the Transportation Squadron may provide as a
service to the unit.
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                               51


   13.15.1. Military taxi service is provided as a quick-response, point-to-point service to all requesters
   requiring official transportation. To reach this goal, taxis cannot be dispatched to one user for an
   extended period of time. The maximum waiting time at each destination is five minutes unless
   approved by the dispatcher. If a user requires additional time, it may be necessary to call for another
   taxi or explain the circumstances to the dispatcher at the time of request.
   13.15.2. The Vehicle Operations Flight has a limited number of general-purpose vehicles assigned for
   the support of base operations. U-Drive-It (UDI) vehicles are available on a first-come, first-served
   basis. The request should be submitted at the earliest possible time to better ensure that support can be
   provided. If the requirement will be for more than 24 hours, a written request must be submitted to the
   chief dispatcher.
   13.15.3. Wrecker service is provided by the Vehicle Operations Flight during normal duty hours when
   requested by vehicle maintenance. During normal duty hours an operator must accompany the vehicle
   to vehicle maintenance to expedite entry into the repair system. Wrecker service after normal duty
   hours may be obtained by contacting the Vehicle Operations Flight’s dispatch section. Any request
   after normal duty hours will be limited to emergencies only (i.e., vehicles blocking traffic on or off the
   flight line creating a hazard, and off-base disabled vehicles). The wrecker operator will transport the
   disabled vehicle to the vehicle maintenance compound. The unit VCO must have someone report to
   vehicle maintenance on the following duty day to formally turn the vehicle in for maintenance (see
   paragraph 13.18.).

13.16. Unique Transportation Support. For unique transportation support (i.e., distinguished visitor
[DV], Inspector General [IG], TDY support), a standard request letter stating who, what, when, where,
and how long is required to initiate vehicle support (Figure 13.5.). This letter should be forwarded to the
chief dispatcher as soon as possible to ensure appropriate transportation support.
52                                                                   AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004

13.17. GOV Licensing and Training.
     13.17.1. Operator Records and Licensing (ORL). ORL is responsible for licensing all military, civil-
     ian, and contractor personnel operating GOVs, and maintaining operator licensing records and train-
     ing documentation. Military and civilian personnel who possess a valid motor vehicle license issued
     in any of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, or similar licensing jurisdiction can
     apply for a license to operate GOVs. NOTE: Everyone who operates a GOV must be entered in the
     licensing computer at ORL. For questions on the licensing of others, refer to AFI 24-301, Chapter 4.
     13.17.2. Vehicle Operator Training.
        13.17.2.1. Each organization conducts all required vehicle training for its personnel. A list of
        qualified instructors by vehicle type is designated by the VCO as instructors for the unit. This
        must be updated annually by request on official letterhead (Figure 13.6.). The VCO will forward
        the trainers’ list to the fleet management office, which will request a background check conducted
        by the Security Forces Squadron. Based on the check, the VOO/VOM will approve or disapprove
        the request.
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                             53

       13.17.2.2. Personnel undergoing initial or specialized training are considered student operators
       and possess an AF Form 171, Request for Driver’s Training and Addition to U.S. Government
       Drivers License. The AF Form 171 serves as a learner's permit until certified by an instructor.
       After a student operator shows competency in operating the vehicle and certified by an instructor,
       the unit commander or VCO/VCNCO validates the successful training by signing the form. ORL
       will use the form as a source document to initiate or update an operator's record.
   13.17.3. Vehicle Operator’s Information. AF Form 2296, Vehicle Operator’s Information, is estab-
   lished and maintained for each vehicle operator issued an AF Form 2293, U.S. Air Force Motor
   Vehicle Operator Identification Card. It provides information on official qualifications, back-
   ground, and experience. AF Form 2296 is a permanent record and is forwarded to the new duty station
   each time a member transfers.
54                                                                    AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


     13.17.4. Motor Vehicle Operator Identification Card. When an individual meets licensing require-
     ments in accordance with AFI 24-301, Chapter 4, an AF Form 2293 is prepared for the approval of the
     VOO/VOM (or personnel designated as authentication officials). The AF Form 2293 is the actual
     license carried by the operator and is valid indefinitely, unless suspended or revoked.
     13.17.5. TDY Personnel. Personnel in TDY status may operate Air Force vehicles when on official
     orders and when in possession of a valid state and military license for the vehicle to be operated.
     13.17.6. Members Separating. Members separating from the service may keep their license if they
     bring it to ORL to be over-stamped, "NOT VALID - SEPARATED FROM THE SERVICE." When
     transferring to another military station, the ORL office at the gaining base must validate the govern-
     ment operator’s permit before allowing the member to operate a GOV at that installation. For infor-
     mation concerning licensing of Federal civilian personnel, contractors, duplicate licensing,
     suspension, or revocation of driving privileges, restoration of driving privileges, and reexamining an
     operator, see AFI 24-301, Chapter 4.

13.18. Maintenance.
     13.18.1. Maintenance on Non-Air Force Procured Vehicles. All requests to locally purchase equip-
     ment for which vehicle maintenance has a primary or assistant maintenance responsibility are sent
     through the vehicle maintenance manager (VMM) or vehicle maintenance superintendent (VMS).
     Coordination should be accomplished before purchasing the equipment to ensure maintenance can be
     performed and parts are obtainable. The VMM or VMS will refuse maintenance responsibility for
     equipment if the request to purchase the equipment was not properly routed through vehicle mainte-
     nance for coordination and without the necessary technical data. Organizations procuring non-regis-
     tered equipment will coordinate with the VMM or VMS to make sure parts, facilities, manpower, and
     funds are available for support before it is required. Organizations should consider purchasing a main-
     tenance agreement to support the equipment.
     13.18.2. Turn-in Procedures.
        13.18.2.1. When turning in a vehicle to the shop for scheduled or unscheduled maintenance,
        ensure the following:
            13.18.2.1.1. The AF Form 1800 for the vehicle is completely and properly filled out.
            13.18.2.1.2. The vehicle is clean inside and out, and waxed if needed.
            13.18.2.1.3. The vehicle has at least three-fourths of a tank of fuel, unless the vehicle’s prob-
            lem is fuel-related.
            13.18.2.1.4. The individual turning the vehicle in for maintenance is knowledgeable of the
            vehicle’s problem.
        13.18.2.2. Contact your local vehicle maintenance shop for vehicle turn-in hours.
        13.18.2.3. Contact vehicle maintenance for mobile maintenance calls.
        13.18.2.4. Vehicles requiring minor repairs should be driven to vehicle maintenance as soon as
        possible. Examples of items considered to be minor maintenance are wiper blades, vehicle light-
        ing, tire repairs, and engine belts. If there are any questions concerning vehicle safety or repair
        requirements, the Vehicle Operations Flight should be contacted.
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                              55


       13.18.2.5. Only VCO/VCNCOs should call vehicle maintenance to request the status of vehicles
       in maintenance.
       13.18.2.6. It is imperative that repaired vehicles be picked up in a timely manner. This is espe-
       cially true during exercise and contingency operations. During these times, vehicles provide a
       prime target for enemy or terrorist actions. When your unit is notified that a vehicle is ready, all
       efforts must be made to have the vehicle picked up as quickly as possible.
   13.18.3. Vehicle Modification/Addition. In accordance with AFMAN 24-307, a vehicle modification
   is a major change to the configuration of a vehicle, and a vehicle addition is the adding of special
   equipment and commercial optional parts or accessories to meet certain operational needs but does
   not change the original purpose of the vehicle (e.g., camper shells, bed liners, radios, bins/shelving,
   lift gates, pintle hooks, extra lights). Organizations must submit a written request to vehicle mainte-
   nance for all modifications/additions. Unit operations and maintenance (O&M) funds will be used for
   initial and replacement items for installation. If vehicle maintenance cannot install the required items,
   the organization must also budget for commercial installation. Organizations that request to install
   their own equipment must have the vehicles inspected by vehicle maintenance after installation to
   ensure safe and serviceable operation. See Figure 13.7. for a sample modification/addition letter.

   13.18.4. Deploying Unit Vehicles. All vehicles going TDY for 30 days or more and all vehicles being
   processed through the cargo deployment function must be turned into vehicle maintenance for a lim-
   ited technical inspection (LTI). To ensure the vehicle is safe and serviceable and that all scheduled
   maintenance is accomplished before it leaves the base. These vehicles are also required to have an
56                                                                      AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


     incoming LTI upon return from the deployment or TDY so that any damage may be charged to the
     fund cite of the deployment.
     13.18.5. Scheduled Maintenance Policy.
        13.18.5.1. A computer-generated appointment letter is provided to the unit VCO/VCNCO when
        vehicles are due for scheduled maintenance (e.g., annual inspections, oil changes). Every effort
        will be made to provide these letters three to four weeks before the actual appointment date.
        13.18.5.2. Vehicles must be processed into the vehicle maintenance customer service center
        (CSC) on the date and time of the scheduled appointment. Vehicles projected for TDY during this
        appointment are turned in before departing. Others may be brought in earlier to meet mission
        requirements. Maintenance control will work with units on a case-by-case basis to resolve sched-
        uling conflicts.
     13.18.6. Vehicle Repair Waivers. Repairs for mechanical discrepancies that are not cost-effective to
     repair immediately, will not cause further damage to the vehicle, and are not safety items may be
     waived.
     13.18.7. Standby Mechanic. During other than normal duty hours, the vehicle dispatch office will
     receive requests for emergency roadside repairs. The dispatcher will ensure the using organization is
     requesting mission-essential or emergency vehicle repairs and is below their MEL for this specific
     vehicle, or the vehicle is critical to real-world requirements. Additionally, the dispatcher will ensure a
     replacement vehicle is not available within the using organization or through vehicle dispatch. After
     verifying all criteria and determining that the vehicle is needed for mission accomplishment and no
     substitute is available, the dispatcher will then contact the standby maintenance technician.

                                                Chapter 14

                                     COMMAND AND CONTROL

14.1. Concept. Command and control enables personnel to assemble information into a coherent whole,
allowing commanders to make sound decisions and effectively use available resources. The term “com-
mand” is defined as the act of giving orders or an authoritative direction. Command seeks mission accom-
plishment and leadership is the primary means to achieve the desired results. The term “control” is
defined as exercising authority to regulate, direct, or influence, and includes sound resource management.
Together, command and control culminate in a harmonious relationship that drives the mission.

14.2. Wing Operations Center (WOC). The WOC is primarily concerned with continuing flying oper-
ations or the base mission, and the general condition and operations of the base facilities. Typical staffing
within the WOC consists of the wing commander and representatives from the aircraft operations, aircraft
maintenance, logistics support, intelligence, and weather functions. Other personnel may be added as the
situation dictates. The WOC decides on recovery operation priorities based on input from the Survival
Recovery Center (SRC).

14.3. Survival Recovery Center (SRC). The SRC is established specifically to direct all base operabil-
ity, survivability, and recovery operations. The SRC is typically located with or near the WOC battle staff
area to allow close coordination of the recovery effort. In the SRC, the combat support group commander
and staff form the nerve center for base recovery as they receive, analyze, prioritize, display, and report
information on the status of the base. The SRC reports their findings to the WOC for confirmation, where-
upon the SRC disseminates the information to the Damage Control Center (DCC) and other command
elements. Several control centers support the SRC.

14.4. Damage Control Center (DCC). The DCC is the SRC hub where civil engineering strategies and
priorities are determined; a vital civil engineering function in wartime and peacetime. The effective setup
and operation of the DCC enhances CE’s ability to assess, equip, repair, and maintain Air Force bases
(OCONUS or CONUS) during natural disasters, manmade disasters, accidents, and war. The DCC moni-
tors and coordinates civil engineer recovery action, damage assessment, decontamination, damage recov-
ery, and repair as directed by the SRC. The DCC also maintains a service call function to respond to
emergency requirements. It is imperative that the DCC is operative for CE to take the lead in emergency
response planning before and after disasters or attacks.

14.5. DCC Responsibilities.
   14.5.1. DCC assumes responsibility to record all events log items and notify appropriate personnel.
   14.5.2. DCC consults the electrical superintendent to obtain a current generator status and aircraft
   arresting system list.
   14.5.3. DCC maintains the status of vehicles and their location by retrieving vehicle information from
   the VCNCO. The DCC controls reallocation of vehicles among recovery teams.
   14.5.4. DCC obtains the status of fuel storage and dispensing from the mechanical superintendent.
   14.5.5. Obtain from the noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC) of material control the status of
   all general supplies, such as lumber, piping, sheet metal, and cement.
58                                                                     AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


     14.5.6. Any reports on limiting factors (LIMFAC) will be sent to the SRC.
     14.5.7. DCC relays information to Air Base Emergency Repairs Operations (ABERO), Rapid Run-
     way Repair (RRR), Damage Assessment Team (DAT), and SRC members.
     14.5.8. The officer in charge (OIC) collects the following:
        14.5.8.1. Utility maps.
        14.5.8.2. Disaster Preparedness Operations Plan (OPLAN) 32-1.
        14.5.8.3. AFI 10-211, Civil Engineer Contingency Response Planning.
        14.5.8.4. Prime BEEF Implementation Guide (if required).
        14.5.8.5. Tracking charts and logs.
     14.5.9. If necessary, the damage control officer will direct the establishment of a two-shift operation
     for the recovery force.
     14.5.10. The DCC will keep the SRC informed of damage. Information will be provided for the sub-
     mittal of Operations Report (OPREP) 3, Operations Event/Incident Reports.
     14.5.11. Notify SRC where displaced personnel are to be placed due to extensive facility damage.
     14.5.12. Off-base contractor assistance can be obtained through the contracting officer to repair dam-
     age beyond the ability of CE to repair.

14.6. DCC Reports. At any given time during a contingency operation, reports will have to be made
from available information. Reports may be handwritten, printed, typed, or given verbally. Once damage
is assessed it must be immediately recorded, plotted, and a Damage Assessment and Repair Team
(DART) must be assigned according to priorities. Facilities and utilities priorities are normally listed in
AFI 10-211; if this is not available at your location you must generate your own facility and utility priority
list. The following are reports that may have to be generated:
     14.6.1. Damage assessment reports.
     14.6.2. Higher headquarters reports (normally by the command post, but will require CE input for
     damage assessment activities).
     14.6.3. OPREP-3 report on the extent of damage to utilities, housing, and facilities.
     14.6.4. CE personnel reports.
     14.6.5. Tempest Rapid (employment of military resources in natural disaster emergencies).
     14.6.6. Commander’s situation report (SITREP) and follow-on report to OPREP-3.
     14.6.7. Bulk petroleum contingency report (reporting emergency petroleum, oil, and lubricants
     [REPOL]).
     14.6.8. Contract repair documentation.
     14.6.9. Vehicle and generator status reports.

14.7. Establishing the DCC. The Support Group commander, BCE, or the Operations Flight com-
mander will activate the DCC. The DCC is managed by the chief of operations and predominately staffed
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                               59


by senior personnel from various elements of the Operations Flight. Engineering and operations personnel
are part of the staff acting as damage plotters, status keepers, schedulers, resource personnel, and coordi-
nators. Typically, operations management is responsible for setting up and supervising the DCC opera-
tion. The DCC has a predetermined location with adequate communications and working space. The area
should be large enough to hold the DCC staff, have space for charts and maps, and allow room for com-
munication flow from the DCC teams.
   14.7.1. Planning is the key to prepare for contingencies. Plans are required to be on file and ready to
   use at a moment’s notice. The following are minimum requirements and each different location may
   have a different plan, due to geographical location, mission, or other reasons. These plans should be in
   the DCC in wartime or peacetime. If deployed to a bare base, some of these plans, even though written
   for a certain base, could be useful for the checklists that they contain. You may also want to have some
   field guides in the DCC, such as the AFPAM 10-219 series (contingency operations) and the Air Force
   Handbook (AFH) 10-222 series (bare bases). When the DCC is relocated, take the following reference
   material if possible:
       14.7.1.1. AFI 10-211.
       14.7.1.2. OPLAN 32-1.
       14.7.1.3. Snow plans (if required).
       14.7.1.4. Standard base checklist or OIs.
       14.7.1.5. Vehicle dispersal plan.
       14.7.1.6. Camouflage, conceal, and deception (CCD) plan.
   14.7.2. Radios are the most frequently used means of communications during contingencies. DCC
   personnel and contingency teams should be trained to use radio communication properly. There is typ-
   ically a base station and a set of hand-held radios. Some units may have Scope Shield radios in the
   mobility package. If your unit does have this type you should become familiar with their use. Radios
   come in many different styles and all are assigned a frequency from base communications. Factors
   that affect the range of radio equipment are weather, terrain, antenna, power, and the location of the
   unit itself. Interference in the form of static often occurs when you use radios near power lines, gener-
   ators, other radio stations, bad weather, or enemy jamming.
       14.7.2.1. Communications security (COMSEC) denies or delays unauthorized personnel from
       gaining information of value from telecommunications.
           14.7.2.1.1. Use authentication tables to ensure the other communications station is a friendly
           one.
           14.7.2.1.2. Use only approved codes to send information.
           14.7.2.1.3. Designate periods when all radio equipment is to be turned off.
           14.7.2.1.4. Restrict the use of radio transmitters (monitoring radio receivers/listening silence).
           14.7.2.1.5. Enforce net discipline and radio procedures.
           14.7.2.1.6. Use proper site selection, minimum power, and minimum transmission time.
           14.7.2.1.7. Use directional antennas when possible.
60                                                                     AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


        14.7.2.2. Because of recent enhanced radio jamming development, more emphasis is placed on
        visual communications for command and control. Visual signals include arm and hand signals,
        pyrotechnics, smoke, flashing lights, and panel markers. The effectiveness of any signal will
        depend upon a set of prearranged meanings.
        14.7.2.3. Sound signals, like visual signals, depend upon prearranged meanings. Sound signals
        include the use of the voice, whistles, horns, weapons, and other-noise making devices to transmit
        simple messages over short distances. Their best application is as a command post warning alarm.
        14.7.2.4. Wire communications are not often used during a work party undertaking; however, it
        does have an application with other Prime BEEF activities such as beddown. Installing a wire net-
        work is time-consuming, but it is more secure than radios. Radios are subject to damage from
        vehicular traffic and enemy offensive action.
        14.7.2.5. Messengers are a means of transmitting large and bulky items such as maps and docu-
        ments, as well as oral and written correspondence. This pertains to personnel who are assigned to
        deliver documents to and from the sender.
        14.7.2.6. Whatever types of communications are used, always have a backup system. The follow-
        ing is a simple checklist for communication failure. There should be steps in place to cover the
        communication failure.
            14.7.2.6.1. Assemble and brief runners to act as a backup communication system.
            14.7.2.6.2. Alert the electrical response team to stand by if required.
            14.7.2.6.3. Notify base communications personnel, by runner, of communication failure.
            14.7.2.6.4. Use the fire/crash truck public address system if needed and if available.
            14.7.2.6.5. Use visual communication if available.
     14.7.3. Display boards should be easy to read and maintain. As information is gathered this data
     should be displayed, plotted, and or recorded. Display boards come in many styles and shapes and are
     kept updated as the information becomes available. Some display boards can be made and stored or
     displayed during non-contingency operations. Display boards should be mobile in case the DCC has
     to relocate to an alternate area. All damage and status can be tracked in a laptop computer in case there
     is no time to remove boards so the DCC can be quickly set up at another location. Each contingency
     is different and may require different display boards but the following are necessary for the DCC to be
     kept abreast of the contingency situation:
        14.7.3.1. Generator status, size, building number (if applicable), spares, fuel capacity and refuel-
        ing times.
        14.7.3.2. Vehicle listing for all CE vehicles.
        14.7.3.3. Damage plotting; normally done on a base grid map, to include runway damage, unex-
        ploded ordnance (UXO), facilities, and utilities.
        14.7.3.4. Barrier status, mobile aircraft arresting system (MAAS), or fixed arresting gear (if
        required).
        14.7.3.5. Work in progress, indicating damage repair.
        14.7.3.6. Radio call signs.

        14.7.3.7. Team composition.
        14.7.3.8. Personnel rosters (availability, by Air Force Specialty Code [AFSC]).
   14.7.4. Supplies vary from location to location. The unit may be tasked to a bare base or other contin-
   gency that requires the use of bare-base assets. It is very important to read and understand the packing
   list of these assets. It is important to remember that most of the needed materials will probably come
   from the local economy. The DCC NCOIC must be familiar with purchasing regulations; know the
   contracting officer/NCO and supply NCO; know how to use the IMPAC card; and other available pro-
   cedures to procure materials. Basic materials to augment base stockpiles may be available through the
   base contracting office, such as aggregate plumbing supplies, boxes, pallets, sandbags and ties, elec-
   trical supplies, and strap bands.
   14.7.5. Contingency stockpiles are not normally maintained at Air Force bases. An adequate inven-
   tory of basic construction materials is on hand for initial recovery efforts through bench stock levels in
   each work area and stocks on hand. Table 14.1. gives quantities that could normally be expected to be
   immediately available on base.

14.9. DCC Personnel Duties. Not all DCC personnel duties are described; local base procedures may
differ from those described below.
     14.9.1. On most occasions, the ranking operations management member is the NCOIC of the DCC
     and responsible for establishing and managing the DCC. The DCC is typically a contingency opera-
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                            63


  tion and the Production Control Center (PCC) is the peacetime version. During wartime or peacetime
  contingencies the DCC continues to process, direct, and deliver vital information to CE personnel.
  The NCOIC reports directly to the OIC of operations and the BCE (or their representatives). Below
  are some checklists for the NCOIC.
     14.9.1.1. Run the DCC position checklist for the OIC as follows:

     14.9.4. The Material Control NCOIC will obtain the status of general supplies, such as lumber, pip-
     ing, sheet metal, and cement, and notify the damage control officer.
     14.9.5. Below is a brief description of teams that are associated with the WOC, SRC, and the DCC.
     These teams perform such tasks as RRR, damage assessment and repair, nuclear, biological, and
     chemical (NBC) survey, UXO removal, and other recovery tasks.
        14.9.5.1. Damage Assessment Team (DAT). These are specialized teams comprised of a
        cross-section of AFSCs required to assess a general or specific type of damage, search and iden-
        tify UXO, evaluate repair and demolition requirements, estimate manpower and equipment
        requirements, and coordinate on-scene recovery operations. They are dispatched to a location or
        area by the DCC.
        14.9.5.2. Facilities Damage Assessment Team. Facilities damage is damage that occurs to every-
        thing except the airfield launch surface. Typically, three-person DAT teams will be dispatched to
        assess and report the damage, and the DART will expediently repair the damage.
        14.9.5.3. Airfield Damage Assessment Team (ADAT). Airfield damage is damage that occurs to
        runways, taxiways, and aprons used to launch aircraft. Usually two three-person DAT teams are
        combined to form a six-person ADAT team.
        14.9.5.4. Damage Assessment and Repair Team (DART). These teams are of variable sizes and
        AFSCs necessary to perform expedient repair of facilities and utilities other than RRR.
        14.9.5.5. Specific-function DARTs.

14.10. Notification of Disaster. Upon notification of an actual or simulated disaster, the DCC performs
the following actions:
   14.10.1. The service call function will serve as the DCC and all current CE activities will be termi-
   nated until the disaster response is controlled.
   14.10.2. Coordinate with the DCC OIC for the extent of implementation.
   14.10.3. Maintain a record of events.
   14.10.4. Initiate a recall of personnel depending on the time of day; use the pyramid or supervisor
   methods.
66                                                                      AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


        14.10.4.1. After normal duty hours, contact the commander to initiate a pyramid recall.
        14.10.4.2. During normal duty hours, the DCC will contact all supervisors of branches/shops/sec-
        tions by radio/telephone.
        14.10.4.3. The orderly room should provide the status of personnel to determine who is TDY or
        on leave, and who should be expected to be available for duty.
     14.10.5. Implement a sign-in location for recovery team personnel at the classroom.
     14.10.6. Notify personnel to turn in radios and vehicles.
     14.10.7. Issue radios and vehicles to damage response teams.
     14.10.8. Ensure contingency checklists are comprehensive and complete.

14.11. Initiating Personnel Recall. When notified of a recall/mobilization initiated by the command
post, activate the DCC per the CE commander and perform the following:
     14.11.1. Initiate contingency response checklists if so directed by the SRC.
     14.11.2. Develop personnel sign-in function (performed by the First Sergeant/orderly room).
     14.11.3. Upon completion of the recall, report personnel strengths to the Mobility Control Center
     (MCC) in accordance with requirements established by the base mobility plan.

14.12. Pre-deployment Planning Overview. Operations management is a vital part of the pre-deploy-
ment planning and should be involved in all aspects, including the advance deployment team. The NCOIC
of operations management could seek out what is available at the deployed site. These can be incorpo-
rated into your deployment kits. See Attachment 2 for a guideline to collecting pre-deployment informa-
tion to assist in the planning process.
     14.12.1. The Joint Engineer Planning and Execution System (JEPES) is the computer model used by
     theater planners to estimate theater-level wartime requirements for facilities, construction material,
     and civil engineer capability in support of deployed U.S. forces.
     14.12.2. The contingency response plan provides needed detail to permit rapid implementation of
     joint planning efforts.
     14.12.3. In planning for any contingency, the civil engineer support plans should make maximum use
     of local resources. For operations of short duration, facility requirements normally will be met
     through the use of existing facilities, organic field equipment, and portable facility substitutes such as
     Harvest Falcon and Harvest Eagle sets. When the situation may involve long-term, sustained opera-
     tions, maximum use will be made of modular or pre-engineered facilities and supporting utilities.
     14.12.4. The civil engineer must consider environmental and force protection policies in support
     planning. The Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) must be conducted on contingency
     plans; performing the EIAP during planning may reduce or eliminate environmental impact that
     would otherwise result from contingency operations. In the absence of specific command guidance,
     engineers will analyze the threat and expected damage and plan for sufficient facility hardening, dis-
     persal, NBC warfare defense, and camouflage to ensure the survival of adequate facilities, equipment,
     and personnel to continue essential combat support operations.

14.13. Mobility Overview. Mobility teams are management tools used to form the CE contingency
response force. Once civil engineer personnel arrive at a deployed location, they organize into a work
force similar to that of the peacetime structure to accomplish force beddown requirements. The civil engi-
neer work force then transitions into contingency response mode for performing post-attack recovery
operations by forming specialized contingency response teams.

14.14. Prime BEEF Mobility Deployment. The principal objectives of the deploying Prime BEEF team
is to beddown and support a deploying aircraft squadron. While there are numerous variables in size and
mission associated with each type of aircraft, CE tasks are similar in type, though scope and intensity may
vary greatly. The following subparagraphs give an overview of Prime BEEF's principal employment cat-
egories. Beddown constitutes the first and most important effort for civil engineer contingency employ-
ment.
   14.14.1. Force Beddown.
       14.14.1.1. Force beddown is divided into three categories: aircraft, personnel, and infrastructure
       support. Aircraft support provides maintenance shops, hangars, squadron operations facilities,
       munitions storage, fuel storage, and other facilities directly supporting the flying mission. Person-
       nel support provides housing, feeding facilities, latrines, showers, administrative offices, and other
       indirect support facilities. Infrastructure support provides utility systems, solid and hazardous
       waste disposal, roads, and communications that serve the beddown site. Beddown locations range
       from main operating bases with adequate existing facilities to bare bases with no facilities other
       than runways, taxiways, and aircraft parking aprons. The unpredictable nature of Air Force
       deployments dictates that civil engineers are able to provide beddown support under a variety of
       conditions/scenarios. There are three beddown stages: initial, intermediate, and follow-on, leading
       to sustaining operations. The tasks below outline the most severe base development: a bare base.
       As more of a deployment base's facility and infrastructure assets are host-nation provided, the civil
       engineer's job focuses on repair, renovation, and O&M. Construction work done during this phase
       of operations, according to pre-established priorities, is as follows:
           14.14.1.1.1. Category 1. Airfield: Runway, taxiways, hardstands, apron and other airfield
           pavements, navigation aids, barriers, airfield lighting and markings, overruns and approach
           zones.
           14.14.1.1.2. Category 2. Sanitary Facilities: Kitchens, dining areas, showers and latrines.
           14.14.1.1.3. Category 3. Direct Operational Support Facilities: Ammo storage and aviation
           fuels and lubricants storage and distribution.
           14.14.1.1.4. Category 4. Maintenance, Operations and Supply Facilities: Aircraft mainte-
           nance, base shops, operations buildings, base communications, photo labs, fire stations,
           weather facilities, general storage and medical.
           14.14.1.1.5. Category 5. Indirect Operational Support Facilities: Roads and exterior utilities
           (water supply, electric power, central heat plant).
           14.14.1.1.6. Category 6. Administration and Special Housing: Headquarters, personnel ser-
           vices, recreation and welfare, enlisted and officer quarters.
           14.14.1.1.7. Category 7. General Housing: Enlisted and officer quarters.

        including proposed asset dispersal locations and complete functional area location for each
        agency or unit.
        14.14.1.2.6. Develop a beddown construction priorities list; include all functions to be bedded
        down, their specific location, and specific construction requirements, including hardening
        requirements. Ensure that priorities are sanctioned by the US forces command element (agreed
        upon by all key agencies).
        14.14.1.2.7. Determine the number of people to be bedded down (male and female officers,
        male and female airmen).
        14.14.1.2.8. Complete an administration/housing space requirements table based on the num-
        ber of people to be bedded down.

        the tent city layout (layout will be determined according to situation), functional locations
        within the tent city, proposed expansion plan (for beddown of additional forces), utility
        requirements and proposed connections (water, electricity, sewer).
        14.14.1.2.12. Develop a construction plan/work schedule for CE operations to perform
        required construction in priorities dictated by the beddown construction priorities list.
        14.14.1.2.13. Ensure the host nation representative is kept informed at each step of the bed-
        down process, especially on proposed construction.
     14.14.1.3. Initial Beddown Stage. During the initial stage of base development, civil engineer
     efforts are concentrated on accomplishing the tasks necessary to meet the mission requirement
     within 72 hours. The following outlines typical tasks accomplished during the initial phase of bed-
     down:
        14.14.1.3.1. Develop and establish water points.

            14.14.1.5.16. Prepare an emergency disposal range for EOD use in munitions destruction.
     14.14.2. Sustainment. The transition from beddown to sustainment is reached when most of the tem-
     porary assets (e.g., Harvest Falcon) support work is complete and the engineer's operational focus
     shifts to operations, maintenance, and upgrade activities. The anticipated duration of the deployment
     drives the extent of many of these activities. During peacetime, work requests generally come to the
     PCC on the AF Form 332. During a contingency the information may come over a phone, radio, ver-
     bally, or written. The main concept is to track and record the work request. As time allows, the paper-
     work can be completed and formally prepared. It is very important to track and maintain the log of
     work requests. Most requests that come during a contingency are real-world and needed immediately
     in the eyes of the requestor. This may not be a priority in the eyes of the SRC and DCC. The SRC will
     determine the priorities and the way and manner in which the requests will be accomplished. This
     could mean that you do nothing, make expedient repairs, or simply hold the requests for later.
     14.14.3. Reconstitution. Prime BEEF and all other users of bare-base facilities and equipment are
     responsible for properly preparing their facilities and equipment for loading and shipment. Facilities
     and equipment are packaged and marshaled in accordance with the guidance provided in the redeploy-
     ment section of the unit mobility plans and in a manner that provides the least disruption of base sup-
     port. CE personnel aid others in the packaging and marshaling of their facilities and equipment on a
     time-available basis. Each user is responsible for bare-base asset preparation and turn-in to aerial port
     personnel for eventual loading and transport. This preparation includes cleaning, damage reporting,
     proper packing, and delivery to a designated location. Reconstitution phasing will typically be incre-
     mental and associated with the planned phase-down of the base support functions. Other units will
     typically accomplish the depot-level reconstitution of bare-base assets. Depot-level reconstitution for
     the various end-item assets includes replacement of missing parts, repairing damaged items, and
     repackaging and storage for the next use.
        14.14.3.1. Improve personnel protective shelters.
        14.14.3.2. Increase hardening features of base facilities.

AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                             73


      14.14.3.10. Establish material stocks for potential base recovery efforts.

      14.14.3.14. Provide quality-of-life improvements, such as increased square footage and air condi-
      tioning.
      14.14.3.15. Construct recreational facilities.
      14.14.3.16. Provide increased utility support to outlying and heavily populated areas.
      14.14.3.17. Construct protective structures such as sunshades and wind breaks.
      14.14.3.18. Identify augmentation teams for shelter operations, contamination control areas, and
      Base Recovery After Attack (BRAAT) operations.
   14.14.4. Restoration. At the conclusion of the deployment, the host nation-owned land and facilities
   made available for U.S. use must be restored. The host nation status of forces agreement or other bind-
   ing bilateral document will normally describe the restoration conditions required
   (paragraph 14.15.). The civil engineer will be responsible for accomplishing this task or coordinating
   with the host nation to have it done. Typically, the restoration will be done by contract, usually
   through host nation auspices. Site restoration to host nation-stipulated conditions is an important step
   to successfully bring final closure to the deployment. An inadequate site restoration effort could gen-
   erate adverse political, environmental, and economic ramifications.

14.15. Host Nation Issues.
   14.15.1. Support Agreements. Host nation support agreements vary from country to country and can
   be very complex. The civil engineer work request may affect the agreement, so it is important that the
   agreements and limitations are understood. Typically, host nation support agreements are written by
   the BCE and reviewed and negotiated by the contracting officer and coordinated with Air Force legal
   personnel. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is the same as an agreement.
   14.15.2. Other Support. Besides land and facilities, host nation agreements may specify labor, sup-
   plies, equipment, and base services that the host nation will provide. Even if there is no specific
   requirement to use host nation support, at most locations local nationals can provide services such as
   refuse and hazardous waste collection, construction equipment rental, supply delivery, custodial sup-
   port, and varying degrees of construction, base maintenance, and utility systems support. Depending
   on the deployment mission and identified threats, force protection measures may mitigate against
   extensive use of local national labor.
   14.15.3. Real Property. The minimum requirement for deployment of an Air Force flying unit to a
   specific location is a runway and water. The host nations supporting the deployment offer one of two
   real property conditions: occupied or unoccupied host nation air bases. For non-flying deployments
   the host nation-offered real property support will normally be tied as closely to the mission require-
   ments as possible, but could be simply an isolated, bare piece of land.
   14.15.4. Bases. In situations where U.S. forces deploy to host nation-occupied air bases (collocated
   operating bases), they become tenants with specific facilities and areas of the base made available.
74                                                                    AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


     Under these conditions the host nation shares the airfield (runway, taxiways, and parking aprons), but
     proffered airfield buildings and base support facilities will probably be limited. CE must plan and
     develop the U.S. portion of the base to accommodate the deployed forces, factoring in renovation,
     maintenance, and repair requirements for existing facilities and infrastructure. At locations where the
     U.S. is offered an unoccupied host nation base, CE can usually expect a significant amount of renova-
     tion, maintenance, and repair effort to meet minimum deployment requirements. Joint support agree-
     ments, status of forces agreements, or other country-to-country agreements will dictate tenant and
     host responsibilities throughout the deployment.
     14.15.5. Non-flying Deployments. Normally the host nation and the U.S. will have agreed to the pro-
     vision of specific land, facilities, and other infrastructure to meet the deployment's mission needs.
     Conditions range from full facility and utility support to nothing but a bare piece of land at the right
     location. CE must plan and develop a comprehensive package to ensure all infrastructure aspects of
     the deployment are met. Joint support agreements, status of forces agreements, or other coun-
     try-to-country agreements will dictate U.S. responsibilities throughout the deployment.

14.16. Post-deployment Planning. Post-deployment planning is as important as pre-deployment plan-
ning and is weighed on the size and nature of the contingency. If it was a full bare-base beddown or natu-
ral disaster, and Air Force equipment and supplies are scattered about, they must be cleaned, repaired, and
stored which requires a logical and systematic approach. Every contingency is different and levels of
effort will change. The contingency, work requests, and the list of equipment and supplies that were used
must be logged. Once the work outlines have been developed to start the cleanup and repackaging of the
equipment and supplies, execute the reconstitution and restoration.

14.17. After-action Reports. After-action reports are necessary to give leaders, planners, and MAJ-
COMs the positive and negative results. Reports offer the opportunity to explain what happened, why it
happened, what worked and didn't work, and recommend changes to the way the operation was executed.
This flow of information is based on the accumulation of data that the DCC has collected. An after-action
report can be simple or complex; it is difficult to judge the size or complexity of the report without know-
ing the contingency. If the report is based on a regional conflict such as Desert Storm, then the report will
be quite complex with many players. If it is a small recovery effort (fire, tornado) in a local community
then the report would be a simple report. Normally during natural disasters or other incidents, civilian
agencies, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or local police will contain or
manage the contingency. During a major war or major military operations other than war (MOOTW), or
other major military operation, CE will be heavily involved and commanders will rely on civil engineer
expertise and documentation to generate reports. As a general rule, any problems that occur with equip-
ment, contracts with locals, supplies, and manpower should be tracked. The following are typical topics
or sections of after-action reports that can be generated from the data collected.
     14.17.1. Personnel. This report involves the CE personnel, by AFSC, that were involved in the con-
     tingency, typically to determine if the skill composition was correct.
     14.17.2. Equipment. This report explains what type of equipment was used. If bare base, it could be
     Harvest Falcon sets and any problems associated with the equipment.
     14.17.3. Supplies. Supplies are always a challenge and it seems that there is never enough of one item
     and too much of another. Logistics play a large part if the material is coming from CONUS to OCO-
     NUS. In some situations equipment and supplies come at the wrong time or sequence. If there is a
AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004                                                                             75


   problem in this area, the situation needs to be tracked and reported so before the next contingency the
   situation may be corrected. Do not forget the damage reports for bare base assets.
   14.17.4. Contracts with Local Suppliers/Contractors. This report involves QAE responsibilities, time,
   and energy. The reports generated from this involve many players. The contract could not be written
   well, may not cover enough areas, or any combination of things. This normally can be corrected in the
   field with change orders and addendums.
   14.17.5. Other Reports. No two contingencies will be the same and all have unique challenges. There
   are many other after-action reports that may need to be generated and it is difficult to determine until
   the situation arises.

14.18. Cargo.
   14.18.1. Re-palletize Cargo. This function typically relates to unique unit requirements such as con-
   solidated tool kits, individual tool kits, and other unit equipment. The principle works the same as
   reconstitution. Inventory all equipment and supplies that were brought, make a list of broken, dam-
   aged, or missing parts, and when the unit arrives back at home station, repair, replace, clean and
   re-palletize the unit’s equipment to make sure the unit is ready for the next contingency. The following
   checklist may assist in re-palletizing your equipment. Members on the team should be trained on pal-
   let build-up. There are several ways to position Prime BEEF equipment on a pallet. If possible, check
   with the aircraft loadmaster to determine the requirements.
   14.18.2. Palletized Cargo List.
      14.18.2.1. Typically, all pallets are shipped with three-point dunnage, and the pallets are
      100 millimeters by 100 millimeters (4 inches by 4 inches), with a minimum length of 2.24 meters
      (88 inches).
      14.18.2.2. Pallets should be clean and free of oil and grease.
      14.18.2.3. Pallets should not be warped, which may affect or bind the dual rail system during the
      loading process.
      14.18.2.4. There must be no bent lips on either side of the 2.24-meter pallet.
      14.18.2.5. Is the pallet and load compatible with the aircraft width, height, and weight limitations?
          14.18.2.5.1. C-141 and C-5 Aircraft. Pallet cargo dimensions are 2.13 meters (84 inches) long
          by 2.64 meters (104 inches) wide; no safety aisle is required.
          14.18.2.5.2. C-130 Aircraft. Pallet cargo dimensions are as follows:
                14.18.2.5.2.1. At least 355 millimeters (14 inches) between the outer edge of the cargo and
                the aircraft, beginning no more than 914 millimeters (36 inches) above the cargo floor.
                14.18.2.5.2.2. At least 762 millimeters (30 inches) between the outer edge of the cargo and
                the aircraft, beginning no more than 1.5 meters (60 inches) above the cargo floor.
      14.18.2.6. All tie-down equipment must be functional.
      14.18.2.7. Netting will consist of two side nets and one top net, and they must be connected and
      tightened securely.
76                                                                     AFPAM32-1125V1 23 JULY 2004


        14.18.2.8. All tie-down equipment must be tightened securely to hold all cargo firmly to the pal-
        let.
        14.18.2.9. Any loose or free cargo on the pallet is prohibited.
        14.18.2.10. All strap ends must be stowed to prevent interference with the aircraft rail and roller
        system.
        14.18.2.11. All pallets require a plastic covering that must be under the netting and straps. The
        plastic must cover all the cargo; fiberglass containers do need a plastic cover.
        14.18.2.12. Is hazardous cargo readily visible and accessible on the pallet? Is DD Form 1387-2,
        Special Handling Data/Certification, filled out and attached to the cargo? Is the Shippers Decla-
        ration of Dangerous Goods (SDDGS) visible and firmly attached to the cargo?
        14.18.2.13. Pallets are limited to 250 pounds per square inch loading.
        14.18.2.14. Is the packing list attached to all containers on the pallet?
        14.18.2.15. Is the load list attached to the fiberglass containers?
        14.18.2.16. Has all the proper paperwork been prepared and delivered to the Mobility Processing
        Center?
