           proceed at the direction of ManTech Antenna Maintenance, VIIDS, CATV, or Cable
           Maintenance to dig around the cable to provide sufficient area for the communication
           technicians to accomplish repairs to their cables.
           1.1.6.2. If a contractor damages a communication cable, the excavator will proceed at
           the direction of the Contracting Officer or designated representative to dig around the

           repairs to their cables. If the Contracting Officer decides the excavator is negligent,
           the excavator will make all necessary repairs to bring the communications system to
           acceptable operation considering advice of communications technicians using
           applicable Technical Orders. Each repair will be considered on a case by case basis.
       1.1.7. Notify 39 CS, Job Control, (Bldg 477, extension 676-2666), immediately upon
