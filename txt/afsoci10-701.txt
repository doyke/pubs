SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It integrates new Air Force
Doctrine Document 2-5, Information Operations, and updates the definition of OPSEC to coincide with
Joint Publication (JP) 3-54, Joint Doctrine for Operations Security. It introduces the OPSEC Coordinator
position at the directorate-level and below wing-level and lays out the duties and responsibilities for all
levels of OPSEC within the AFSOC organizational structure. It also places related security disciplines
into a table for ease of use, links OPSEC risk assessment to Operational Risk Management (ORM), pro-
vides specific requirements for both training and assessment, defines AFSOC critical information, estab-
lishes a destruction of sensitive but unclassified material requirement (HQ AFSOC specific policy

                                            INTRODUCTION

1.1. General. OPSEC is a military capability within Information Operations (IO). IO is the integrated
employment of three operational elements: influence operations (Influence Ops), electronic warfare oper-
ations (EW Ops), and network warfare operations (NW Ops). All three contribute to the integrated air,
space, and information operational plan to disrupt, corrupt, or change targeted human and automated deci-
sion-making while protecting our own. Influence Ops employ core military capabilities of psychological
operations (PSYOP), OPSEC, military deception (MILDEC), counterintelligence (CI) operations, public
affairs (PA) operations and counterpropaganda operations to affect behaviors, protect operations, commu-
nicate commander’s intent and project accurate information to achieve desired effects across the cognitive
battlespace. OPSEC protects friendly operations and efforts to influence the adversary’s behavior.

1.2. Definition. OPSEC is a process of identifying, analyzing and controlling critical information indi-
cating friendly actions attendant to military operations and other activities to:
   1.2.1. Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems,
   1.2.2. Determine what indicators adversary intelligence systems might obtain that could be inter-
   preted or pieced together to derive CRITICAL INFORMATION in time to be useful to adversaries,
   and
   1.2.3. Select and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities
   of friendly actions to adversary exploitation (JP 3-54).
   1.2.4. OPSEC is a process and not a collection of specific rules and instructions that can be applied to
   every operation. OPSEC must be closely integrated and synchronized with other Influence Ops capa-
   bilities and all aspects of the protected operations.

1.3. Characteristics of OPSEC. The goal of OPSEC is to identify information and observable activities
(indicators) relating to mission capabilities, limitations and intentions in order to prevent exploitation by
our adversaries. OPSEC methodology provides a step-by-step analysis of our operations and behavior
from an adversary’s perspective, thereby assessing how vulnerabilities might be exploited. Information
that adversaries need to achieve their goals constitutes critical information about our operations or pro-
grams. By identifying and protecting this critical information, the OPSEC process becomes a positive,
proactive means by which adversaries are denied an important advantage.
   1.3.1. Operational effectiveness is enhanced when commanders and other decision-makers apply
   OPSEC from the earliest stages of planning. OPSEC involves a series of analysis to examine the
   planning, preparation, execution and post execution phases of any activity across the entire spectrum
   of military action and in any operational environment. OPSEC analysis provides decision-makers
   with a means of weighing how much risk they are willing to accept in particular operational circum-
   stances in the same way as ORM allows commanders to assess risk in mission planning. In fact,
   OPSEC can be referred to as information risk management.
   1.3.2. OPSEC must be closely coordinated with other security disciplines (see Table 1.1.) as applica-
   ble. The primary focus of OPSEC analysis is to deny exploitation of open source information and
   observable activities. These sources are generally unclassified and difficult to control.

    1.3.3. OPSEC provides a method of identifying our critical information and denying or controlling an
    adversary’s access to that information. OPSEC enables friendly force information superiority by neu-
    tralizing adversary information collection activities.
       1.3.3.1. OPSEC will be employed with other complementary IO activities to obtain maximum
       effectiveness. Commanders and their planners should utilize all capabilities within IO, including
       OPSEC, in a synchronized effort to influence the perceptions and affect decision-making of an
       adversary. For example, a known OPSEC vulnerability may be used to deliver a deception mes-
       sage or psychological operations theme, instead of simply correcting or mitigating the vulnerabil-
       ity. In this case, the use of the discovered vulnerability would be considered the appropriate
       application of an OPSEC measure.

1.4. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) OPSEC. AFSOC implements OPSEC in all
functional areas. Commanders are responsible for OPSEC awareness throughout their organizations and
for integrating the OPSEC process throughout all mission areas. AFSOC commanders and decision-mak-
ers will employ OPSEC during mission planning, mission support, force execution and throughout the
acquisition process. OPSEC will be incorporated into day-to-day activities to ensure a seamless transition
to contingency operations.
AFSOCI10-701 22 JUNE 2006                                                                                   7


   1.4.1. OPSEC issues must be integrated into every aspects of planning and execution of all AFSOC
   operations. OPSEC assists in the protection of AFSOC capabilities and intentions by degrading an
   adversary’s knowledge of and subsequent ability to attack our forces or counter our operations.
   Embedding OPSEC into campaign planning and force execution maximizes mission effectiveness.
   1.4.2. OPSEC supports AFSOC research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&E) through the
   reduction of compromised technology and proprietary information. Acquisition organizations that
   fail to implement OPSEC could unintentionally reveal critical program information, ultimately
   increasing operational risk as potentially compromised systems are fielded.
   1.4.3. AFSOC OPSEC is an integral process of force protection, helping protect service members,
   civilian employees, family members, facilities and equipment at all locations and in all situations.
   Force protection relies heavily on OPSEC as a means of denying targeting information to terrorists
   and other adversaries. Since force protection safeguards the AFSOC’s most precious asset—people,
   it is critical that OPSEC be applied throughout the Command.

1.5. The OPSEC Process. The OPSEC process consists of five distinct steps: 1) identification of critical
information, 2) analysis of threats, 3) analysis of vulnerabilities, 4) assessment of risk, and 5) application
of appropriate OPSEC measures.

2.1. Purpose. The purpose of the AFSOC OPSEC program is to provide commanders with standardized
policy and to facilitate effective OPSEC programs by promoting general understanding and awareness
regarding the integration and application of OPSEC. An overall AFSOC OPSEC Program Manager (PM)
is identified within the headquarters staff to advise on the integration of OPSEC into command-wide
efforts and to develop policy and guidance that provides coordination, training, education and recognition
for AFSOC-wide OPSEC programs.

2.2. Roles And Responsibilities. All AFSOC organizations must integrate OPSEC into their planning
and develop OPSEC plans (wing-level or equivalent) to ensure a viable OPSEC program is created and
maintained that identifies the organization’s critical information and indicators and develops OPSEC
measures to counter their inherent vulnerabilities. AFSOC units will integrate OPSEC into military strat-
egy, operational and tactical planning and execution, all support activities, all contingency, combat and
peacetime operations and exercises, communications/computer architectures and processing, weapons
systems RDT&E, AFSOC specialized training, inspections, acquisition and procurement, and profes-
sional military education programs. Although the OPSEC program helps commanders make and imple-
ment decisions, the decisions are the commander’s responsibility. Commanders must understand the risk
to the mission and then determine which OPSEC measures are required.
    2.2.1. Headquarters, AFSOC Responsibilities. The Commander, AFSOC is the office of primary
    responsibility (OPR) for the AFSOC OPSEC program. AFSOC/CC is responsible for coordinating
    OPSEC policy, doctrine, strategy and investment priorities within the command. Other organizations
    having individual responsibilities for elements of OPSEC will coordinate with the HQ AFSOC
    OPSEC PM to ensure the consistent and standardized application of OPSEC policy and guidance.
       2.2.1.1. Commander, Air Force Special Operations Command will: (Note: Commanders may
       delegate authority for OPSEC program management, but retain responsibility for risk manage-
       ment decisions and the overall implementation of OPSEC measures.)

           implementation, posture and operations within the command and all assigned units. Addition-
           ally, he is responsible for enforcing OPSEC policies and directives, ensuring that OPSEC
           plans and programs at every echelon are supported by the existing intelligence organizations/
           infrastructure at those levels.
           2.2.1.1.2. Designate a full-time primary and alternate PM, in writing (see AFSOC OPSEC
           Plan for letter template). The PM may be military (Officer or NCO) or DOD civilian (GS-12
           or above) having or able to obtain a Top Secret clearance. Forward a copy of the appointment
           letter to HQ AF/A3I.
           2.2.1.1.3. Ensure an OPSEC program is developed IAW policy and guidance issued by HQ
           AF/A3I and USSOCOM/J39 and that all subordinate organizations integrate OPSEC into
           day-to-day operations. Ensure OPSEC is integrated with other IO activities.
           2.2.1.1.4. Ensure OPSEC funding is programmed for all OPSEC training through established
           budgeting and requirements processes.

                                     UNIT OPSEC PROGRAMS

3.1. Purpose and Composition. AFSOC OPSEC programs support the commander’s efforts to accom-
plish a successful and effective mission. Each program is composed of an OPSEC PM or coordinator,
OPSEC plans, funding, training, assessments and feedback. AFSOC OPSEC programs must have the fol-
lowing critical aspects: commander involvement, operational focus, integration, coordination and assess-
ment.
   3.1.1. Commander Involvement. Commanders are responsible for ensuring OPSEC is integrated into
   day-to-day operations. Commanders may delegate authority for their OPSEC program management,
   but retain responsibility for risk management decisions and the overall implementation of OPSEC
   measures.
   3.1.2. Operational Focus. The AFSOC OPSEC program is an operations program and its goals are
   information superiority and optimal mission effectiveness. The emphasis is on OPERATIONS and
   the assurance of effective mission accomplishment. The unit OPSEC PM and Coordinator should
   reside in the operations or plans element of an organization or report directly to the unit commander to
   ensure effective implementation across organizational and functional lines. However, for those units
   with no traditional operations or plans element, the commander must decide the most logical area to
   place management and coordination of the unit’s OPSEC program while focusing on operations and
   the mission of the unit.
   3.1.3. Integration and Coordination. PMs and coordinators will integrate OPSEC into all organiza-
   tional plans and activities. Staff elements and supporting organizations will ensure OPSEC is appro-
   priately incorporated at the earliest possible time into all operations plans (OPLANs), concept plans
   (CONPLANs), concept of operations (CONOPs), operations orders (OPORDs), exercise plans, Initial
   Capability Documents (ICD), Capability Development Documents (CDD), Initial Requirement Doc-
   uments (IRD), program protection plans (PPP), operating procedures and other plans and activities to
   ensure consistent control of critical information and OPSEC indicators. All applicable contracts,
   Statements of Work (SOW), Requests for Proposals (RFP), Contract Security Classification Specifi-
   cation (DD Form 254) and similar documentation will contain specific statements or requirements
   that address security criteria for protecting critical information and OPSEC indicators. All OPSEC
   PMs and coordinators will add an OPSEC section to each respective annex to all organizational plans.
   The appropriate functional area OPSEC PM or coordinator will evaluate all appropriate contractual
   documents regarding OPSEC and will work with the local contracting office to ensure the intent of the
   program is met.
       3.1.3.1. AFSOC OPSEC must be an integral part of an overall IO effort. This applies to other IO
       and Influence Ops functions that also protect friendly information and that may influence the
       adversary’s decision-making process. For example, integration of OPSEC and Public Affairs is
       particularly important as the need to protect critical information must be balanced against the
       desire to provide information to the public. The OPSEC PM or coordinator will maintain copies
       of all applicable Public Affairs guidance and ensure the Public Affairs office is aware of critical
       information elements.
       3.1.3.2. AFSOC OPSEC is integrated into the Air Force Special Operations Forces (AFSOF) Air
       Operations Center (AOC) through the IO Specialty Team. IO Specialty Team OPSEC coordina-
14                                                                     AFSOCI10-701 22 JUNE 2006


        tors/planners work within the AOC to ensure planning and execution of air, space and IO incorpo-
        rate OPSEC. IO Specialty Team OPSEC coordinators/planners work with the rest of the IO
        Specialty Team to integrate OPSEC with other IO activities. When an AOC is formed, IO Spe-
        cialty Team OPSEC coordinators/planners become the focal point for integrating the activities of
        supporting elements OPSEC PMs and coordinators. This ensures the Commander, AFSOF, has a
        coherent OPSEC effort across all units.
        3.1.3.3. Each wing/SOG will have a written OPSEC plan. OPSEC PMs will follow AFSOC
        OPSEC Plan format in developing their own, uniquely tailored OPSEC Plan.
     3.1.4. Assessment. Assessment of your program is critical to its continued grow and success. There
     are several assessment programs that can be used to check the health of your OPSEC program. Here
     are two that are easy and inexpensive to use.
        3.1.4.1. Self-Assessment. PMs and coordinators will accomplish a self-assessment of their
        OPSEC Program using this instruction and the self-assessment checklist located in Attachment 3,
        NLT 30 September of each year.
        3.1.4.2. Program Assessment. The HQ AFSOC OPSEC PM, wing and wing-equivalent PMs will
        accomplish a program assessment of their assigned unit’s OPSEC programs using AFI 10-701,
        AFSOCI 10-701, and the self-assessment checklist located in Attachment 3 biennially (every two
        years).

3.2. AFSOC OPSEC PMs. OPSEC PMs and alternates will be assigned at wing- or wing-equivalent
level (SOGs, FOA, and DRUs) and above. Organizations at wing or wing-equivalent level (and above)
must appoint an OPSEC PM and alternate, in writing (see AFSOC OPSEC Plan for letter template). The
wing or wing-equivalent level PM can come from any organizational level the commander deems appro-
priate. For example, the wing PM may actually be assigned at the Operations Group level, but performs
OPSEC PM duties in direct support of the entire wing. The respective wing or wing-equivalent com-
mander will sign appointment letters. Letters of appointment must be forwarded to the HQ AFSOC
OPSEC PM. OPSEC PMs should be assigned for a minimum of 18 months to allow the PM to obtain
proper training and experience. The OPSEC PM requires a security clearance appropriate to the mission
and function of the organization, but no lower than Secret. Wing or wing-equivalent (and above) PMs
require SIPRNET access to read OPSEC Advisory Reports, whether in their work center or from another
terminal on the installation. Wing or wing-equivalent OPSEC PMs may also serve as the lead Influence
Ops and IO Manager. Wing (host unit) OPSEC PMs will coordinate OPSEC with tenant unit OPSEC
PMs and/or coordinators. AFSOC tenant unit OPSEC PMs will closely coordinate and integrate with host
wing OPSEC initiatives; however, administrative oversight of the tenant unit’s program still resides with
HQ AFSOC/A3I. If the host organization has an OPSEC working group, the tenant unit PM will seek
representation in it.
     3.2.1. HQ AFSOC OPSEC PM duties include, but are not limited to:
        3.2.1.1. Develop, coordinate and manage the AFSOC OPSEC Program, OPSEC Plan and imple-
        mentation of OPSEC into day-to-day operations throughout the command.
        3.2.1.2. Act as primary advisor to the AFSOC/CC on all OPSEC matters.
        3.2.1.3. Develop and implement the commander’s OPSEC policies and command’s critical infor-

in writing. AFSOC/CC also requires coordinators within HQ AFSOC directorates. The respective com-
mander or HQ AFSOC Directors will sign appointment letters. Letters of appointment must be forwarded
to respective HHQ OPSEC PM. Coordinators can come from any area of the organizational the com-
mander/director deems appropriate and should work directly for the commander/director. All OPSEC
coordinators will maintain an appropriate clearance, but a minimum of Secret is required. HQ AFSOC
Directorate OPSEC coordinators require SIPRNET access to read OPSEC Advisory Reports, whether in
their work center or from another terminal within the directorate. If possible, OPSEC coordinators should
not have any other additional duties. AFSOC tenant unit coordinators will closely coordinate and inte-
grate with host wing OPSEC initiatives; however, administrative oversight of the tenant unit’s program

3.4. OPSEC Planners. OPSEC planners are personnel who accomplish the duties of an OPSEC Coordi-
nator, but have received specialized planning training (i.e. IO Integration Course, AOC Field Training
Unit). OPSEC Planners normally reside within the AFSOF construct. When employed within the AOC,
OPSEC Planners function as part of the IO Specialty Team.

3.5. The OPSEC Working Group (OWG). An OWG will be established at wing- or wing-equivalent
level and can be established at AFSOC directorate-level to facilitate the AFSOC OPSEC Program. In
addition, an ad-hoc OWG should be established for any large-scale operation or exercise. At the wing- or
wing-equivalent level, the OPSEC PM will chair the OWG and report directly to the commander. The
OWG will ensure the timely and efficient review of activities and future plans. The OWG will also inte-
grate OPSEC into all organization planning and operational processes. The OWG composition will vary
depending on various projects or activities being performed. At a minimum, the OWG should include a
representative from each exercise or operation, as well as any direct units associated with an exercise or
operation. Recommended members include the MILDEC Officer, PSYOP Officer, Senior Intelligence
Officer, PA Officer, Force Protection Officer, Information Assurance Officer, Local AFOSI Detachment
and subordinate OPSEC coordinators. The OWG force protection member may be either a representative
from the Wing Anti-terrorism Office (ATO) or installation Security Forces. The OWG should compli-
ment installation anti-terrorism working groups (formerly Threat Working Groups), force protection
working groups and critical infrastructure working groups.

                                                 Chapter 4

  AIR FORCE SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND OPSEC EDUCATION AND TRAINING

4.1. Purpose. Initial and annual OPSEC training provides AFSOC personnel (military and civilian) with
general knowledge of the OPSEC process. Air Force contractors who have access to mission critical
information will also receive the same training. This training ensures AFSOC personnel and supporting
contractors understand their individual responsibilities, realize the positive benefits of proper OPSEC and
gain a greater appreciation of how AFSOC uses OPSEC measures to minimize the exploitation of critical
friendly information. Formal OPSEC training is accomplished through the 39 IOS and provides in-depth
training designed to ensure proper management and execution of OPSEC programs.

4.2. OPSEC Education and Training is a Continuing Requirement. OPSEC awareness education
and training must be provided to all AFSOC personnel, military, civil service and contracted individuals
working within specific offices inside of AFSOC organizations (i.e., HQ AFSOC/A3, 16 SOW/SE, etc.)
Additionally, all contractors who work “en mass” (i.e., construction projects, work crews, etc.) must
ensure employees receive OPSEC training within 30 days of initial assignment to a contract on or around
an AFSOC installation, organization or facility. The serving OPSEC PM or coordinator will provide this
training. AFSOC OPSEC education and training is broken down into four sub-areas: initial, unit-spe-
cific, annual, and PMs and coordinators. OPSEC PMs and coordinators will track and document the com-
pletion of training for all military, civilian and contractor personnel. General guidelines for this education
and training follow below.
     4.2.1. Initial OPSEC education and training will be provided to all AFSOC personnel (as noted in
     paragraph 4.1.1.), within 90 days of arrival on-station. This may be provided through mass in-brief-
     ings such as new-comer’s orientations, first-term airman centers or combined with the unit-specific
     training at the unit-level. This training will provide a brief overview of the OPSEC process, the
     importance of understanding the organization’s critical information and the general adversary threat
     for the installation. Attendance of personnel’s spouses and family members should be encouraged.
     4.2.2. Unit-specific OPSEC education training when coupled with initial OPSEC training is the best
     approach to developing OPSEC awareness in all personnel within the organization. This training will
     be provided as part of unit in-processing for all new personnel and before individuals receive access
     to mission critical information. Unit-specific OPSEC training will provide assigned personnel famil-
     iarization with potential adversary threats related to the unit, critical information associated with the
     unit’s mission, job specific OPSEC indicators and the OPSEC measures they will execute. All per-
     sonnel should provide OPSEC awareness training to their spouses and family members as well.
     4.2.3. Annual OPSEC Refresher Training. All personnel require annual OPSEC refresher training.
     This training should include, but not be limited to: 1) a review of the OPSEC process and terms, 2)
     review of the unit’s CIL, 3) updated briefing on the local adversary threat, and 4) currently employed
     OPSEC measures to counter those threats.
     4.2.4. OPSEC Education and Training Requirements for PMs and Coordinators.
        4.2.4.1. Formal OPSEC Training. This level of training is required for all individuals designated
        as OPSEC PMs at wing-level or wing-equivalent and above, and HQ AFSOC Coordinators at the
        director-level. AFSOC personnel who are IO Red Team members, conduct MDVAs or formal
        OPSEC surveys, OPSEC Planners and IG inspections team members conducting OPSEC inspec-
AFSOCI10-701 22 JUNE 2006                                                                                23


       tions are required to complete this training. At a minimum, the OPSEC PMs at the Wing-level or
       wing-equivalent and above must attend the AF OPSEC Course conducted by the 39th Information
       Operations Squadron at Hurlburt Field, FL within 90 days of appointment (120 days for HQ
       AFSOC Coordinators), or in the next available AF OPSEC course. Alternate OPSEC training can
       be acquired through the Interagency OPSEC Support Staff’s (IOSS) DOD OPSEC Course or
       equivalent (see HQ AFSOC OPSEC PM for requirements); however, the Air Force course is the
       preferred method. OPSEC PMs must maintain general awareness of current OPSEC related
       events and seek continuation training at every opportunity. OPSEC PM training is unit-funded.
       4.2.4.2. Informal OPSEC Training. Coordinators below wing-level are strongly encouraged to
       attend formal Air Force OPSEC training; however, coordinators below wing-level should seek
       training directly from their wing-level PM. Wing PMs should provide this training within a rea-
       sonable time of appointment or by the next available class. Coordinator’s training is unit-funded.
       4.2.4.3. Requests for formal OPSEC training must be forwarded through wing or wing-equivalent
       PMs to the HQ AFSOC OPSEC PM, who will prioritize the command’s requirements and submit
       them to the AF OPSEC Course Registrar. Requests for IOSS courses may be made directly to the
       IOSS (www.ioss.gov). All OPSEC PMs will advise the HQ AFSOC OPSEC PM when training
       has been completed.

4.3. OPSEC Training Documentation. All OPSEC coordinators (including OPSEC PMs who conduct
this training) will track initial and annual OPSEC training and report training metric results to respective
wing- or wing-equivalent level OPSEC PMs for inclusion into their annual OPSEC self-assessment
reports. Wing- or wing-equivalent level OPSEC PMs will forward their combined results to HQ AFSOC
OPSEC PM.

                                       OPSEC ASSESSMENTS

5.1. Purpose. OPSEC assessments are accomplished to gauge the overall health of the OPSEC program,
to examine actual practices and procedures and to identify new or previously undiscovered vulnerabili-
ties. Commanders, PMs and coordinators use assessment results within the risk management process to
implement protective measures and improve the OPSEC posture of the unit/activity.

5.2. Scheduling. AFSOC PMs will coordinate with their wing- or wing-equivalent commanders and
units (including tenant units if you are the host unit) in scheduling assessments. Once the type of assess-
ment and a recommended date are determined, contact the HQ AFSOC OPSEC PM for scheduling. A
callout for IO Assessment will unusually take place each spring for the next FY with a forecast for three
additional years.

5.3. Methods. There are several types of assessments available to OPSEC PMs or coordinators to gauge
the effectiveness of their program. The nature of the assessment depends on the unit’s mission criticality,

     5.3.1. Program Self-Assessment.
        5.3.1.1. AFSOC wing- or wing-equivalent PMs and coordinators will conduct annual self-assess-
        ments of their OPSEC programs. Self-assessments allow PMs to assess the health of their OPSEC
        program, evaluate compliance with applicable policies and to identify shortfalls and vulnerabili-
        ties.
        5.3.1.2. Self-assessments are conducted using a checklist. This checklist provides AFSOC
        OPSEC PMs and coordinators a ready-to-use self-assessment tool in which to conduct their eval-
        uation. Attachment 3 contains a self-assessment checklist that can be used with little modifica-
        tion to suit specific unit/activity needs within AFSOC.
            5.3.1.2.1. The checklist is based on the requirements set forth in AFI 10-701 and AFSOCI
            10-701. While not all items may apply in all situations, none of the items listed should be
            removed from the checklist. AFSOC OPSEC PMs at wing- or wing-equivalent level may add
            items of local interest to the checklist.
            5.3.1.2.2. Command and wing-level assessments (see 3.2.1.14. and 3.2.2.1.4.), SAVs and IG
            inspections (UCIs and SIIs) will follow this checklist.
     5.3.2. Web Risk Assessment. See AFI 10-701 for an explanation of this assessment. Web Risk
     Assessments are scheduled through the annual IO Assessment callout.
     5.3.3. Telecommunications Monitoring and Assessment Program (TMAP). See AFI 10-701 for an
     explanation of this assessment. TMAPs are scheduled through the HQ AFSOC OPSEC PM.
     5.3.4. Staff Assistance Visit (SAV). See AFI 10-701 for an explanation of this assessment. SAVs for
     local unit coordinators are scheduled through the respective wing- or wing-equivalent OPSEC PM.
     Wing- or wing-equivalent SAVs are scheduled by the HQ AFSOC OPSEC PM.
     5.3.5. Program Assessment. The HQ AFSOC OPSEC PM, wing and wing-equivalent PMs will
     accomplish a program assessment of their assigned unit’s OPSEC programs using AFI 10-701,

   AFSOCI 10-701 and the self-assessment checklist located in Attachment 3 biennially (every two
   years).
   5.3.6. Survey. See AFI 10-701 for an explanation of this assessment. Surveys are coordinated
   through the HQ AFSOC OPSEC PM.
   5.3.7. Multi-Discipline Vulnerability Assessments (MDVA). See AFI 10-701 for an explanation of
   this assessment. MDVAs are scheduled through the annual IO Assessment callout.
   5.3.8. AFSOC Inspector General (IG) Evaluations. AFSOC OPSEC programs will be evaluated dur-
   ing operational readiness inspections and unit compliance inspections. Additional guidance is pro-
   vided in AFSOCI 90-202, Inspector General Operational Readiness Inspection and AFSOCI 90-205,
   AFSOC Self-Inspection Program.

                             AFSOC CRITICAL INFORMATION LIST

6.1. Purpose. The AFSOC Critical Information List (CIL) is a list of informational items which could
reveal our intentions, capabilities, operations and activities to an adversary. This information is consid-
ered essential to the successful completion of AFSOC missions and should be treated as sensitive but
unclassified information. As such, this information should be given additional protection beyond that of
other unclassified information. (See Attachment 2 for the complete CIL)
   6.1.1. AFSOC critical information should not be disclosed to anyone not having the need for this
   information as a matter of course in completing their assigned duties.
   6.1.2. The use of secure communications (STU-III/STE and SIPRNET) to discuss critical information
   should be your first choice of communicating this information.
   6.1.3. When secure communications are not available, the use of encryption software and password
   encoding over unsecured communications is acceptable.
   6.1.4. The use of unsecured communications should be used only as a last resort or if the need for
   timely transfer of the information is so critical that it outweighs the use of secure communications.
   (i.e., mission failure, life or death, etc.)
   6.1.5. If using unsecured computer communications (NIPRNET), use attachments to transmit your
   information instead of the body of the e-mail. The attachment should be encrypted or password
   encoded before transmitting using the associated creation software (i.e., Microsoft Word, Excel, Pow-
   erPoint, or WinZip, etc.). Transfer of the password to the receiving party should be made by a differ-
   ent means of communication. (i.e., phone, fax, etc.)
   6.1.6. Computer files and databases containing critical information should be stored in secure loca-
   tions with limited access based on “need-to-know.” The use of Public Folders and “common drives”
   are discouraged unless proper controls such as logon and password or some other form of restricted
   access are put in place to protect the information.
   6.1.7. All media including notes and working documents containing the types of information listed in
   the AFSOC CIL will be destroy by the appropriate method for that media when no longer needed.
   (Reference Chapter 7, Destruction of Sensitive But Unclassified Material.)

6.2. Direction. Every AFSOC unit down to squadron-level will develop unit-specific CILs. This effort
will be lead by the OPSEC PM/coordinator and the CIL maintained in accordance with the directions in
this instruction.

6.3. Organization. AFSOC critical information items are listed by functional area. The [ ] marks by
each item contain the timeframe or conditions in which the information is considered to be critical. The
AFSOC CIL is not intended to be all-inclusive. Information not listed, but that has the potential to cause
mission impairment will also be considered critical information and should be treated and protected as
such.

6.4. Contact Information. For additional information on AFSOC critical information, please contact the
AFSOC OPSEC Program Manager.

                                                 Chapter 7

                DESTRUCTION OF SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED MATERIAL

7.1. Purpose. This chapter implements AFSOC policy on and requirements for the proper destruction of
sensitive but unclassified material. It outlines the minimum procedures for destruction of materials con-
taining sensitive but unclassified information as defined by Chapter 6, AFSOC Critical Information List
(CIL). This destruction includes information contained within wing, group and unit CILs, FOR OFFI-
CIAL USE ONLY, and Privacy Act information.

7.2. General. This policy is being implemented in an attempt to minimize the unauthorized accessibility
to AFSOC sensitive but unclassified material in AFSOC organizations. (See Chapter 8 for HQ AFSOC
and AFSOF specific requirements for destruction of sensitive but unclassified paper materials.)

7.3. Guidance. All AFSOC assigned units will develop and implement a destruction of sensitive but
unclassified material program. The program will provide for the destruction of sensitive but unclassified
material as noted above.
     7.3.1. Destruction of paper materials will be accomplished through the process of shredding (see 7.4.)
     or burning (use the same requirements for burning classified materials).
     7.3.2. Video tapes, voice recordings, and computer media (computer disk, ZIP disk, CD-R and RW,
     DVDs, flash drives, flash memory cards or sticks, hard drives internal or external, etc.) will follow
     established requirements for sanitization of that media or destruction at the same level as classified
     media. See your Client System Administrator (CSA), Information System Security Officer (ISSO),
     Security Manager and/or Special Security Office for additional information on the sanitization or
     destruction of these media types.

7.4. Requirements. At a minimum all programs will provide for the destruction of sensitive but unclas-
sified paper products.
     7.4.1. This destruction will include all white bonded paper, official and unofficial working papers/
     notes, and all other materials directly related to or containing operational information or information
     directly supporting operations whether routine (day-to-day) or currently tasked operations. (Please
     reference your unit’s CIL for additional information.)
     7.4.2. This policy does not include items such as unclassified newspapers, magazines or other period-
     icals, and boxes and packing materials that must be recycled. Materials such as food wrappers and
     containers should be disposed of in proper waste collection containers.
     7.4.3. Paper material destroyed through shredding will use “cross-cut” shredders shredding at no
     greater than 5/32” x 2”.
        7.4.3.1. Because many units have already expended funding for strip shredders, it is permissible
        for units to build in an attrition schedule for replacing/upgrading their shedders to meet the
        requirements noted in this chapter. However, this schedule will not extend beyond the fourth
        quarter of FY07.

7.5. Roles and Responsibilities.
AFSOCI10-701 22 JUNE 2006                                                                                  29

   agement of their program, to include any established inspection procedures used to ensure individual
   units are in compliance with this policy.

8.4. Procedures.
   8.4.1. Directors will establish specific procedures to implement their shredding program. To help
   prevent a security violation, do not mix/store classified and unclassified material to be shredded
   together.
   8.4.2. All materials noted in paragraph 8.2. will be shredded as soon as practicable or when no longer
   needed. Documents may be shredded daily or weekly depending on amount and volume to be
   destroyed but should be protected from compromise until shredded.
   8.4.3. At no time will any paper product or material containing sensitive but unclassified information
   be disposed of using the recycling or trash collection system.
   8.4.4. If unclassified shredders are used they must be “cross-cut” shredders shredding at no greater
   than 5/32” x 2”.
   8.4.5. Ensure classified and unclassified shredders are clearly marked to prevent the destruction of
   classified material in an unclassified shredder.

8.5. Shredders. For information on currently available shredders authorized for the destruction of classi-
fied and unclassified material refer to the following web site, https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/ and enter

              AFSOC OPSEC ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS SECURITY ASSESSMENTS

9.1. General. AFSOC personnel use unsecured communications systems such as telephones, cellular
phones, radios, facsimile, pagers, computer networks, and other wired and wireless electronic devices to
conduct day-to-day official business. Adversaries can easily monitor these unsecured systems providing
themselves with valuable information on our military capabilities, limitations, intentions, and activities.

9.2. Telecommunications Monitoring and Assessment Program (TMAP). The 25th Information
Operations Squadron (IOS) Electronic Systems Security Assessment (ESSA) team (proposed AFSOC
ESSA Center) is the lead unit for monitoring AFSOC unsecured and unprotected communications sys-
tems. Their primary tasking is to determine if AFSOC personnel are using sound OPSEC and COMSEC
practices. The information collected is analyzed to determine if any sensitive but unclassified information
transmitted on unsecured and unprotected systems could adversely affect AFSOC operations.
     9.2.1. The 25 IOS ESSA team conduct assessments on a continuous basis with monitoring resources
     adjusted to accommodate exercises, crises, contingencies, and conflicts. The monitoring and subse-
     quent assessing of data are designed to thoroughly examine AFSOC communications systems proce-
     dures associated with a specific weapons system, operations, or activity, and document their
     vulnerability to an adversary’s signal intelligence exploitation. Through systematic data assessment
     and analytical procedures, the ESSA team documents the threat, isolates existing or potential OPSEC
     vulnerabilities and identifies procedures to minimize or eliminate OPSEC vulnerabilities. TMAP is
     an integral part of the AFSOC OPSEC and IO programs with future applications in supporting both
     AFSOC Red Teaming and CounterIntelligence efforts. It is a very effective tool to identify real-world
     problems that can adversely affect our warfighting effectiveness.
     9.2.2. During assessments, the ESSA team will look for such items as stereotyped patterns or admin-
     istrative and physical security procedures that can routinely surface as possible sources of intelligence
     losses. The assessment provides commanders and directors with a product that defines, investigates,
     and offers specific procedures for correction of problem areas.

9.3. Telecommunications Monitoring and Assessment Program Reports. TMAP reports provide
commanders, directors and operational planners with near real-time reports of sensitive but unclassified
information disclosures that may adversely affect AFSOC operations. Commanders, directors and opera-
tional planners should use these reports for evaluating the effectiveness of OPSEC measures and/or devel-
oping measures to diminish the value of disclosed information. They may also use these reports to
identify and focus training requirements and to justify developing and funding corrective actions.

9.4. Telecommunications Monitoring and Assessment Program Authority. HQ AIA ESSA Tasking
Cell is the only AF element that can task assigned ESSA elements to monitor AF activities and organiza-
tions. Only these assigned ESSA elements (includes the 25 IOS) are authorized to conduct TMAP activ-
ities. They in turn, perform TMAP activities in a manner that satisfies the legitimate, legal needs of the
Air Force to provide OPSEC while protecting the privacy, legal rights, and civil liberties of those persons
whose communications are subject to TMAP monitoring.

                                                Chapter 10

                    AFSOC OPSEC CONTRACT SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

10.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes requirements and procedures necessary to ensure contractors
provide OPSEC protection for AFSOC’s critical information through the completion of a DD Form 254,
DOD Contract Security Classification Specification, for all AFSOC contracts where contracted individu-
als or contractors who work “en mass” (i.e., construction projects, work crews, etc.) will have access to an
AFSOC installation, organization, facility or information. This requirement does not apply to individuals
who infrequently access an AFSOC installation or facility (i.e., once or twice per month for an hour or
two per visit).
     10.1.1. Our objectives for this requirement are to:
        10.1.1.1. Protect planned operational activities by preventing the inadvertent disclosure of unclas-
        sified information relating to or revealing a possible classified operation.
        10.1.1.2. To preserve secrecy concerning specific scenario events and a USSOCOM or AFSOC
        response to these events.
        10.1.1.3. To identify OPSEC vulnerabilities and recommend protective measures which will
        serve to enhance the security of future operations.

10.2. Guidance. The government program manager and contracting official will include the following
requirements into all AFSOC contracts as noted above. A contractor shall not implement OPSEC require-
ments nor shall they impose any OPSEC requirements on a subcontractor without prior approval of the
Air Force. Contracts as noted, will have a completed DD Form 254 attached with the following areas
completed:
     10.2.1. Block 11.j. Have Operations Security (OPSEC) Requirements will be marked as “yes.”
     10.2.2. Block 14. will be marked as “yes” and have the following statement:
     “Ref. 11.j. The contractor and his employees will operate under HQ AFSOC (or 16 SOW, etc.)
     OPSEC procedures for the control and destruction of sensitive but unclassified information or materi-
     als containing such information, in all areas where the contractor or his employees may operate in the
     performance of this contract, whether contractor or government owned. See attachment no. ______
     (enter attachment number) for additional OPSEC information.” (See Attachment 4 of this instruc-
     tion for an example of the referenced attachment.)

10.3. Execution. AFSOC employed contractors will be provided unit-specific OPSEC education training
by the assigned unit/directorate’s OPSEC program manager/coordinator on the unit/directorate’s OPSEC
requirements before being given full access to or around an AFSOC installation, organization, facility or
information, but not more than 30 days prior to initial access. Individual training will be developed and
applied as required by the level of contact with AFSOC critical information.

   EXAMPLE OF ATTACHMENT # TO DD FORM 254 FOR OPERATIONS SECURITY
  1. This section outlines the requirements and procedures necessary for contractors to provide Opera-
     tions Security (OPSEC) protection for AFSOC’s critical information.
  2. OPSEC is the process of identifying, analyzing and controlling critical information indicating
     friendly actions attendant to military operations and other activities to:
     a. Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems.
     b. Determine what indicators adversary intelligence systems might obtain that could be interpret
        or pieced together to derive critical information in time to be useful to adversaries.
     c. Select and execute countermeasures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulner-
        abilities of friendly actions to adversary exploitation.
  3. OPSEC principles are used to help assigned personnel:
     a. Maintain a continuing awareness of adversary interest in SOF actions and adversary intelli-
        gence collection capabilities.
     b. To understand the need to identify and protect classified and unclassified indicators that
        reveal sensitive information.
     c. To evaluate the effectiveness of OPSEC measures taken to preclude or reduce adversary
        acquisition and exploitation of sensitive information.
  4. Our objectives are to:
     a. Protect planned operational activities by preventing the inadvertent disclosure of unclassified
        information relating to or revealing a possible classified operation.
     b. To preserve secrecy concerning specific scenario events and a USSOCOM or AFSOC
        response to these events.
     c. To identify OPSEC vulnerabilities and recommend protective measures which will serve to
        enhance the security of future operations.
  5. AFSOC employed contractors will be provided unit-specific OPSEC education training by the
     assigned unit/directorate’s OPSEC program manager/coordinator on the unit/directorate’s
     OPSEC requirements before being given full access to or around an AFSOC installation, organi-
     zation, facility or information, but not more than 30 days prior to initial access. Individual train-
     ing will be developed and applied as required by the level of contact with AFSOC critical
     information.
  6. OPSEC requirements, critical information lists and assistance can be found at the following:
     a. For AFSOC reference AFI 10-701 or contact the HQ AFSOC OPSEC Program Manager,
        AFSOC/A3I at 850 884-6326, DSN 579.
     b. For the 16th Special Operations Wing reference HFI 10-1101 or contact the Hurlburt Field
        OPSEC Officer, 16 SOW/IO at 850 884-4565, DSN 579.
