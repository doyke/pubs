4.1.2. Ensure doors going from a conditioned air space to an unconditioned air space have good
seals and thresholds to minimize escape of conditioned air.
4.1.3. The Facility manager should survey assigned facilities to identify reduction or elimination
of unneeded lighting. During the survey annotate for future reference when an inspection
occurred and when a function has changed the arrangement of office furniture.
4.1.4. Ensure facility occupants shut off fluorescent and incandescent lights when out of the area
longer than 5 minutes. Especially remember to turn lights off during lunch when no one is in the
area.
4.1.5. Brief and emphasize the need for everyone to be concerned about energy conservation.
Have building occupant brief facility manager when something seems irregular in order to
evaluate the situation.
4.1.6. Water heaters are set at 105 degrees F. CE craftsmen will check the temperature.
4.1.7. Building thermostats will be set at the AFI mandated settings of 68 degrees F for heating
and 78 degrees F for cooling.
5. THE FACILITY PRIORITY AND FUNDING PROCESS
5.1. Overvie w. Facility management is a large issue that consumes much of a wing budget.
With limited resources available, the best utilization of those resources must be closely watched
and priorities established. The host base Facility Working Group, Executive Facility Board and
the Facility Board each provide progressive levels of oversight until the wing commander has the
best insight into their facility program and the most information possible from which to base
their decisions. Projects are “racked and stacked” and executed based upon available funding.
With this information in hand, the wing commander approves or modifies the recommended
priorities and then directs the execution of the wing facilities plan.
5.2. Facility Board Process.
5.2.1. The 505 CCW/CC manages space in all facilities currently assigned by the host base.
Space requirements which are over and above what can be met by 505 CCW must be verified,
validated, documented and submitted to the host base for consideration and/or action. Once
                                                             505CCWI32-10 3 AUGUST 2011


submitted, 505 CCW requests enter the host base facility board process and are subject to their
rack and stack.
5.2.2. The 505 CCW/CE is the wing representative to the 1SOCES during the Hurlburt Field
Facility Board process. Geographically separated units should appoint a local POC to represent
their interests at their bases.
5.2.3. Space request procedures. Units finding they require more space must first perform an
exhaustive search within all of their currently assigned facilities before identifying this
requirement to 505 CCW/CE.
5.2.3.1. Unit facility managers must survey their facilities for all workspaces to ensure they are
being properly used as such. Workspaces should not be reserved for printers, copiers, faxes,
refrigerators, storage, snack areas, e.g. Workspaces should be occupied by assigned unit
personnel.
5.2.3.2. After verifying all existing workspaces are occupied, the facility manager must inventory
any space which might be able to be converted into workspace. Determine the number of
additional workspaces which may be constructed in the available space and advise the squadron
commander.
5.2.3.2.1. In accordance with AFH 32-1084, the 505 CCW/CC has determined that, where
possible, the smallest acceptable work area should be no less than 52 SF per person.
5.2.3.2.2. If required, ask 505 CCW/CE for assistance in determining your space requirements.
This may be performed by 505 CCW/CE even if not specifically requested.
5.2.3.2.3. If no space is available in current squadron facilities, submit a space request through
the squadron and group commanders to 505 CCW/CE.
6. COORDINATION OF SPACE ALLOCATION.
6.1. Coordination of Space Allocation. 505 CCW/CE is the focal point for space allocation.
All proposed changes in the use of space (to include any remodeling that requires changes in
heating and ventilation, power, and/or communications systems such as telephone or network
connections will be coordinated with this office. A letter to 505 CCW/CE will suffice as
coordination for changes internal to a directorate (e.g., MS, XP). When a change in the allocation
of space is required between directorates, 505 CCW/CE is responsible for staffing the
reallocation of space. GSUs should follow the directions of their respective Group Commanders.
505 CCW/CE is always available to lend assistance if required.
7. MILCON DESIGN & CONSTRUCTION.
7.1. Requirements Determination. New mission, increased manning and mission growth are
the three major factors impacting wing space requirements. Periodically, 505 CCW/CE will
calculate space requirements and brief results during the Facility Board.
7.1.1. Site Surveys. When required, 505 CCW/CE will request an official site survey through
HQ ACC/A3. This will be accomplished after an internal investigation has taken place and will
be in coordination with HQ ACC/A7.
7.2. Design.
7.2.1. The 505 CCW/CE will be the primary point of contact for all facility designs.
7.2.2. Any/all correspondence with the Architectural/Engineering firm (A/E) and/or 1 SOW, 99
ABW, 377 ABW, Chugach Management Services, HQ ACC and/or Army Corps of Engineers
(COE), related to facility design, will be coordinated with and routed through 505 CCW/CE.
7.3. Construction.
7.3.1. The 505 CCW/CE will be the primary point of contact for all MILCON construction
issues.
                                                               505CCWI32-10 3 AUGUST 2011


7.3.2. Any/all correspondence with the MILCON construction contractor,
Architectural/Engineering firm (A/E) and/or 1 SOW, 99 ABW, 377 ABW, Base Contractor, HQ
ACC and/or Army Corps of Engineers (COE), related to facility Design and/or construction, will
be coordinated with and routed through 505 CCW/CE.
7.4. MILCON Coordination. During both design and construction, all facilities related issues
such as furnishings, communication/computer, audio-visual and power requirements, e.g., must
be coordinated with 505 CCW/CE.
8. NATURAL DISASTER/HURRICANE
8.1. Preparatory Procedures.
8.1.1. During natural disasters and hurricanes, facility managers must maintain close
coordination with the 505 CCW Unit Control Center (UCC). The Chief of Wing Readiness
(DSN 579-9072/9073) is responsible for standing up the 505 CCW UCC. Facility managers
must maintain a current listing of UCC phone numbers in their facility logbook.
8.2. Sandbags (Hurlburt Field).
8.2.1. Wing Storage & Distribution. 505 CCW/CE maintains storage of 1,500-2,000 sandbags
for use at Hurlburt Field during emergency situations. During an emergency, facility managers
will be contacted and 505 CCW/CE pallets of sandbags will be pre-positioned via forklift to
strategic locations near wing facilities (see Attachment 3). Once sandbag pallets are pre-
positioned, units must compose details to assist facility managers in placing sandbags around
each facility, including the mechanical room(s).
8.2.2. During tropical storm and hurricane conditions, the pre-positioning of sandbags will be
done at the time called for in the appropriate HURCON checklist.
8.2.3. Three bags high. Properly sandbagged facilities will have sandbags at all entrances,
tightly stacked end-to-end, three (3) bags high.
8.2.4. Requirements. Facility managers should know how many sandbags are required for each
of their facilities. Forward a list of the number of sandbags each of your facilities requires to 505
CCW/CE and maintain a copy of this list in your facility manager’s notebook.
8.3. Facility Tie-Down/Secure Lists (Hurlburt Field). Facility managers should be aware of
articles around their facilities which require securing in the event of a hurricane. These items
should be listed as well as the procedure used to secure them. This will include where the
securing devices are located. Straps, chains, ropes, e.g., should be kept in a location easily
located during these times. Forward a copy of these lists to 505 CCW/CE.
8.4. Coordination with UCC (Hurlburt Field). Facility managers will report facility
preparation problems and completion to unit UCC representative for forwarding to the Wing
UCC.
8.5. Post Require ment Clean-Up (Hurlburt Field). When sandbags are no longer required,
units will form details to re-palletize their sandbags in the pre-position delivery location.
Contact 505 CCW/CE when pallets are ready to be moved. A forklift will be dispatched to
recover the pallets and return them to covered storage in the Jeep Pen (building 90008).
9. GROUND/FIRE SAFETY
9.1. Ground/Fire Safety. Routine ground safety inspections are accomplished by the wing and
host base safety office facility managers will coordinate with 505 CCW/SE and applicable 505
CCW/SE instructions. Fire safety inspections are done by the host base fire department. Safety
policy instructions can be found on the wing SharePoint site.
9.2. Fire Safety. Each facility manager is responsible to the unit commander for the fire-safe
condition of all facilities under their jurisdiction. Facility managers will:
                                                             505CCWI32-10 3 AUGUST 2011


9.2.1. Accompany the CES fire prevention inspector during the fire prevention visit and take
corrective action on fire hazards or discrepancies found during the inspection.
9.2.2. Accomplish those fire prevention duties outlined elsewhere in this instruction, Air Force
directives and as outlined in the facility managers Fire Prevention Checklist.
9.2.3. Check all fire extinguishers, exit lights and emergency lights on a monthly basis to ensure
proper operating condition and document this inspection in the facility manager facility folder
for each facility. Emergency lights and exit lights shall be tested for no less than 30 seconds
once a month, and no less than 1 ½ hours once per year. Report all discrepancies either via
telephone or on AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request, to the host base Civil
Engineer Squadron Customer Service for corrective action. Discrepancies involving fire
extinguishers should be referred to the Fire Prevention Office for assistance.
9.2.4. Ensure the Emergency 911 label is attached to every telephone.
9.2.5. Ensure all personnel are knowledgeable of fire and emergency reporting, evacuation, and
installed fire suppression and alarm systems activation procedures.
10. COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS
10.1. Geographically Separated Units. Day-to-day space requirements at the geographically
separated units should be addressed at the group level. Each group commander has local final
authority over the allocation of space within their facilities. The wing commander has final
authority. Space requirements which exceed available facility space should be forwarded to 505
CCW/CE and addressed within the local support base Facility Working Group process. Any
add/alter or MILCON requirements growing from the Facilities Board shall be forwarded to 505
CCW/CE for coordination.
10.1.1. Group commanders must review and act upon locally generated space requests. 505
CCW/CE is available for assistance.
10.1.2. All 505 CCW MILCON issues will be routed through 505 CCW/CE for coordination and
action. 505 CCW/CE will participate in all MILCON Site S urveys, Charrettes, and MILCON
design meetings as well as follow-on construction, fit-out, facility commissioning and
acceptance.
10.1.3. 505 CCW/CE will be the POC for all MILCON discussions with HQ ACC/CE, host base,
Army Corps of Engineers, A/E firm and the MILCON construction contractor.
10.1.4. GSU facility managers will keep 505 CCW/CE apprised of any problems they might
encounter with their host base Civil Engineering function or their equivalent.
10.2. Tenants. On bases where units of the 505 CCW are tenants, local base regulations dictate
our CE/Maintenance procedures. The appearance of the exterior of our facilities must remain
within local base standards, but the interiors of our facilities can follow ACC standards.
10.3. MAJCOM. All communications with host bases and MAJCOMs in regard to facilities
issues should be coordinated with 505 CCW/CE, who is the single POC for facilities and
construction for the 505 CCW.
11. MEETINGS
11.1. Space Use. For Hurlburt Field units, a wing Space Allocation Meeting (SPAM) to request,
discuss and help determine space requirements within units making up the wing will be held no
less than quarterly. GSUs will determine/review their specific space requirements at the group
command level. Group commanders are responsible for proper space allocation at their
locations. Requirements needing 505 CCW/CE attention and recommendation may be brought
forward at any time. In all space allocation cases, the wing commander’s decision/approval is
required.
                                                         505CCWI32-10 3 AUGUST 2011
