The purpose of this instruction is to provide general guidance for the Quality Assurance Manager (QAM)
to administer the Quality Assurance Program (QAP) in base level financial management operations. The
program encourages a proactive approach by management to enhance quality of operations while ensur-
ing adequate internal controls are in place to properly safeguard government resources. The instruction
also implements the Chief Financial Officer Act of 1990 and the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity
Act (FMFIA) of 1982 to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in federal programs, functions, and activities.
The program applies to, and requires the compliance of, all personnel at command and installation levels
in financial management activities.

                      PURPOSE OF A QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM

1.1. General. A Financial Management (FM) organization operates in dynamic surroundings. Conduct-
ing business in a “consolidated” environment, managing tight budgetary resources, and supporting world-
wide deployments are examples of “real world” challenges faced at a typical base level organization. The
FM and staff need continual assurance that despite these demands, the unit is performing at peak effi-
ciency. The Quality Assurance Program (QAP) provides the FM with reasonable assurance that (1)
Applicable laws, regulations, and policies are followed; (2) Assets and resources are effectively and effi-
ciently managed; (3) Assets are safeguarded against fraud, waste, abuse and unauthorized use; and (4)
Financial records and reports are reliable, accurate and timely.

1.2. Internal Controls.
    1.2.1. Another important aspect of QA is to ensure internal controls are in place. According to the
    Committee on Sponsoring Organizations of the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial
    Reports, “Internal Control is a process…designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    achievement of objectives” in the following categories:
       1.2.1.1. Reliability of financial reporting.
       1.2.1.2. Effectiveness and efficiency of operations.
       1.2.1.3. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
    1.2.2. The means to meet these overlapping objectives are outlined in this directive.

1.3. Records Disposition. Maintain and dispose of records created as a result of processes prescribed in
this publication and in accordance with AFMAN 37-139, “Records Disposition Schedule.”

                                        RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Financial Manager and Staff. The FM is responsible for the overall management and control of the
QAP. He/she will designate a highly competent person as the Quality Assurance Manager (QAM). The
QAM reports directly to the FM. The FM staff (Financial Services Officer, Chief of Financial Analysis,
etc.) complies with the spirit and intent of the QAP and motivates interest in the program among subordi-
nates. The FM staff is encouraged to use the QAM for an independent review and analysis of operations.
They also provide quality data for performance indicators, and if deficiencies are identified, advise the
FM and QAM of the reasons for the discrepancies and the corrective actions taken to preclude recurrence.

2.2. QAM. The QAM is delegated primary functional responsibility for the QAP. The QAM promotes
quality consciousness among personnel and provides technical assistance and advises the FM and staff.
Subsequently, the QAM administers the QAP in accordance with this instruction and guidance from the
base FM. The QAM periodically examines all areas to determine the effectiveness of procedures and also
determines if supervisors are recording quality data upon which accurate management conclusions and
decisions can be based. Suggested duties are outlined in Figure 2.1.

                                    CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS

3.1. General. Four general elements or methods exist for the QAM and staff to ensure adequate Quality
Assurance and Internal Controls are in place at base level operations. Each of these elements is discussed
in more detail in this instruction. By using these elements, the QAM will be able to ensure the unit is per-
forming in accordance with established standards.
    3.1.1. Process tools provided in the Quality Assurance Instruction.
    3.1.2. Self-Inspection Checklist Program.
    3.1.3. “Cross-feed” Program.
    3.1.4. QAM Fraud Prevention Oversight

3.2. Scenarios. The four scenarios described below will be used as examples in dealing with specific
issues at your operation.
    3.2.1. Scenario 1. The QAM is “cross-fed” another base’s Audit report of the Accounting Liaison
    Office function that recommended to “establish validation and certification of outstanding orders and
    advances as a top priority.”
    3.2.2. Scenario 2. Increasing number of negative customer surveys in Customer Service.
    3.2.3. Scenario 3. FM’s concern over document flow problems with the Operating Location (DFAS
    FIELD SITE).
    3.2.4. Scenario 4. An Audit visit finds several discrepancies in Basic Allowance for Housing and
    Dependency Verifications.

                                          PROCESS TOOLS

4.1. Processing Tools. Regardless of whether “problem” or “improvement opportunities” come from
outside sources (auditors or customer feedback) or are recognized by the FM staff, the next step is for the
QAM and FM to determine which processing tool(s) should be used. The processing tools described
below help to identify root causes of discrepancies, a method to track discrepancies, and recommenda-
tions to fix problems.
   4.1.1. Performance Indicators. Usually recurring in nature (monthly or quarterly), performance indi-
   cators measure actual performance in an area against a certain standard. The QA function gathers the
   data, prepares trend reports, and facilitates discussion with the personnel at an FM staff meeting (or
   QA meeting if the FM desires). Performance indicators provide management with the means to prop-
   erly assess areas within the FM organization.
       4.1.1.1. In scenario one, a performance indicator on timeliness of follow-up on outstanding orders
       and advances would have already provided information that a problem existed before Auditors
       identified any findings. Customer surveys (scenario two) could generate a monthly performance
       indicator that charts the trend of customer service.
       4.1.1.2. Tracking a base’s lost discounts and interest payments are means to assess how inade-
       quate document flow from the FSO to the DFAS Field Sites might be causing an increase in this
       area (scenario three). Finally, a performance indicator that charts whether all entitlement verifica-
       tions are completed would ensure members are correctly paid (scenario four).
       4.1.1.3. Performance indicators should be reviewed at least annually to determine if new ones
       should be added or any can be deleted. A sample list of indicators is shown in Figure 4.1.

4.2. Discrepancy Tracking. As discrepancies are identified, they must be tracked. It is up to each base/
MAJCOM to determine the medium for tracking deficiencies. The processing center chief determines the
estimated completion date (ECD) and appropriate corrective action, and the QAM assigns the tracking
number and ensures the ECD is reasonable. Tracking is initiated for discrepancies or problems identified
from numerous sources: self-inspection questions, quality assurance reviews, compliance reviews, and
8                                                                   AFI65-202 16 NOVEMBER 2000

cross-feed items (audit reports, Inspector General reports, etc.). See attachment 2 for minimum informa-
tion required to be tracked.
    4.2.1. Various MAJCOMs have command specific discrepancy tracking forms. If one is designated
    at your installation, use that form and follow your command guidance in how to open and track local
    discrepancies.

4.3. Discrepancy Tracking Report. A top priority must be given to ensuring all open discrepancies are
aggressively worked until completion. A Discrepancy Tracking Report (See Figure 4.2.) is compiled
monthly and provided to management for review. This report provides the FM with a quick summary of
problem “tracking efforts”.

4.4. Quality Assurance Review (QAR). The QAR is a means to provide the FM with an independent
review of an area. The QAR meets three objectives: (1) determines if a problem exists, (2) if a problem
exists, examines the root cause of the problem, and (3) makes recommendations to correct the problem.
    4.4.1. The suggested format of the completed QAR report is shown in figure 4.3. Note that the QAR
    report is presented in a concise and clear manner for the FM and staff.

  MEMORANDUM FOR FM
  FROM: QA
  SUBJECT: Quality Assurance Review FY99-01: Document Flow to the DFAS Field Site
  Background: FM is concerned with increasing amount of interest penalties and lost discounts.
  Area Reviewed: Accounting Liaison
  Period of Study: 1 October 1998 to 15 October 1998              Actual Hours Spent on Study: 32
  Documentation Reviewed: Daily submission of documents mailed to the DFAS Field Site (October 7,
  9, 10)
  Conclusion: A problem does exist with document flow to the DFAS Field Site.
  Root Causes: (1) Documents are not being “pre-sorted” by the Accounting Liaison office as requested
  by the DFAS Field Site. This makes it difficult for the DFAS Field Site to determine what branch it
  should go to. (2) Routine invoices are being routed through the ALO first and then to the DFAS Field
  Site. Since the ALO merely forwards the documents to the DFAS Field Site, this causes an unneces-
  sary delay in payment processing. (3) Finally, although documents are delivered to the base distribu-
  tion center to be sent by priority mail, they are not going out daily. The distribution center accumulates
  several packages before placing in a single FEDEX shipment. They said they are doing this to save
  shipping expenses.
  Findings/Recommendations:
  1. Follow the document flow instructions provided by the DFAS Field Site. Finding: The ALO staff
  is not following the DFAS Field Site’s document flow guidebook. I talked to the mailroom staff at the
  DFAS Field Site and they indicated that FSOs who use the guidebook are achieving good results.
  2. Inform vendors to send invoices directly to the DFAS Field Site. Many vendors are still sending
  their routine invoices to the ALO for payment. They do not realize that unlike “the good old days” we
  cannot make their final payment; that is a DFAS Field Site’s responsibility. Suggest Contracting
  Squadron publicize this information in their correspondence with local vendors and we also place this
  info on our website.
  3. Coordinate with the Information Management (IM) Staff to ensure FEDEX packages are sent daily.
  Although the IM staff thinks they are saving money through weekly FEDEX Financial shipments, they
  are actually costing the base more money. Suggest the FM send a letter to the Support Group Com-
  mander requesting an immediate change to this practice.
  Number of Findings: 2
                                                                        /s/
                                                                EDDIE POPE, SSgt, USAF
                                                                Quality Assurance Manager
10                                                                    AFI65-202 16 NOVEMBER 2000

     4.4.2. Who can recommend a QAR? Recommendations to conduct a QAR can be made by the FM,
     staff or QAM. SAF/FM, AFAFO, and/or MAJCOM can direct QARs for high interest areas.
     4.4.3. QAR In-Brief. Each QAR begins with an in-brief between the QAM, FM, flight chief, and
     applicable section chief whose area will be reviewed. The purpose of the in-brief is to agree on what
     specific area(s) will be reviewed, and to determine the time period of the analysis.
     4.4.4. QAR Final Report. Allow the section and flight chief an opportunity to review your report
     before “going final”. The QAR final report will also include any Findings or Observations noted by
     QA while conducting the study due to any lack of compliance with applicable directives. A formal
     out-brief to the same group “in-briefed” completes the formal QAR study. A copy of the final report
     should be maintained in the QA Manager’s handbook for quick reference.

4.5. Compliance Review. “Trust but verify” sums up the purpose of using a Compliance Review (CR).
The CR serves as a quick method of providing a “safety net” around FM operations. Unlike the more for-
mal QAR study, the CR is a tool for the QAM to quickly determine if a problem exists or not. The QAM
only needs to review a small sample size because the problem, root cause(s), and recommendations have
already been identified through other sources (Quality Assurance Review, Self-Inspection checklist,
Audit findings, etc.). Thus, a CR can be completed in minimal time, perhaps only an hour or two. A CR
can also determine if procedures established by policy letters, local Operating Instructions (OIs), or
incoming messages are being adhered to.
     4.5.1. Since the purpose of conducting a CR is to ensure agreed upon procedures are in place, the tim-
     ing of the CR is critical. Use the following matrix (Figure 4.4.) in scheduling CRs. It will assist you
     in managing this important tasking. Remember that a CR takes a short time to conduct since the QAM
     relies on a very small sample size to determine if corrective actions are firmly in place.

4.8. Process Action Team (PAT) Studies. Another method to improve operations is the use of a Process
Action Team. Even if standards are being met, the PAT process breaks down the existing procedures and
looks for ways to streamline or improve the overall process. Discussions during QA or other staff meet-
ings are ideal times to initiate a PAT review. In scenario two (negative customer surveys), a PAT may be
an option to pursue if the complaints involve other agencies or a process is too time consuming for the
customers. The team’s composition may include members from other agencies that are involved in the
study (i.e. personnel, transportation, contracting, etc.).

4.9. Quality Assurance Meetings. A QA meeting is a monthly event. The meeting is a means to focus
on QA efforts at the comptroller organization. It allows the processing center chiefs an opportunity to
state the “health” of their operations directly to the FM. The meeting is also a good forum to see what is
going on in the other areas.
     4.9.1. The QAM ensures that any problems or disagreements with tools, such as performance indica-
     tor charts, discrepancy tracking reports, and training reports are resolved before the meeting. The
     QAM serves as facilitator for the meeting and the FM is the chairman. Suggested topics to cover
     include, but are not limited to, the following areas:
        4.9.1.1. Process center chiefs address each performance indicator they are responsible for. They
        note root causes for problem areas and provide recommendations to reverse negative trends.
        4.9.1.2. Action items should be developed for each below standard indicator to include schedul-
        ing training.
        4.9.1.3. The QAM should review training efforts and QA reviews conducted or planned that
        month.
        4.9.1.4. Finally, open discrepancies should be reviewed to ensure all are being worked until com-
        pletion.

4.10. QA Meeting Minutes. Minutes of the QA meeting should be written and published within two
business days of the meeting and distributed to the FM and staff. Minutes should include action items
identified at the meeting, responsible parties, and estimated completion dates.

4.11. QA Manager Handbook. The QA Manager handbook is a mandatory requirement for all
base-level QAMs. The handbook is a means to assist the QAM in their important duties. It allows them
to store associated QA products in an organized manner. Updates to the handbook are provided via the
AFAFO website where it is also electronically maintained.

                                                Chapter 5

                                  SELF-INSPECTION PROGRAM

5.1. General. A comprehensive Self-Inspection Program is another important element of internal con-
trols and Quality Assurance. The checklists will be conducted within all areas to evaluate the effective-
ness of existing procedures and internal controls and to determine compliance with regulatory
requirements.

5.2. Who Conducts Reviews. The FM decides which personnel conduct the actual checklist reviews.
The reviews give processing center chiefs first-hand knowledge of their operations, although they may
not necessarily conduct the review. However, the QAM will not be tasked to perform the inspection
checklists.

5.3. When is it Due. Reviews will be conducted semi-annually by using Air Force prepared checklists.
The FM determines what months they will be due unless local installation policy directs otherwise.

5.4. QAM Role. The QAM oversees the progress for completing the self-inspection checklists and
ensures that responses adequately reflect the actual health of each processing center. The QAM should
encourage “truthful” answers even if problems are identified.

5.5. Substitution of Responses. If there are recent responses to an earlier review (i.e. a cross-feed item,
a Quality Assurance Review, or Audit, etc.), that response can be substituted for a self-inspection check-
list response.

5.6. Validation of Self-Inspection Responses. The QAM validates 10% of inspection checklist
responses. Validation provides reasonable assurance that the reviews were conducted properly. Valida-
tion can also provide additional focus to a high interest item designated by the FM staff. The QAM vali-
dation of self-inspection checklists is accomplished through the use of Compliance Reviews (chapter 4).

                                                 Chapter 6

                                       CROSS-FEED PROGRAM

6.1. General. In today’s environment of electronic communications (websites, email, etc.), exporting
information throughout the financial management community is enhanced. The QAM will be cross-fed
various reports and bulletins on a routine basis through electronic means. In turn, the QAM takes action
or distributes the information accordingly.
     6.1.1. Findings from other locations. In the operational world, an aircraft accident generates a
     “one-time investigation” at other installations to see if a similar problem exists. In the same manner,
     the financial community must share information when things go wrong. For example, if an audit visit
     at one Comptroller organization identifies discrepancies that degrade the reliability of financial
     reporting, effectiveness or efficiency of operations, or compliance with applicable laws and regula-
     tions, then internal controls may be lacking. The ability to cross-feed problem areas is an important
     element of the overall Quality Assurance Program and enhances effective internal controls.
        6.1.1.1. Upon receipt of a negative cross-feed report, the QAM does the following:
            6.1.1.1.1. Conducts a Compliance Review IAW instructions found in this AFI.
            6.1.1.1.2. If the problem does not exist locally, then reports the CR normally.
            6.1.1.1.3. If a problem does exist, the QAM notifies the FM, Flight Chief and applicable pro-
            cessing center chief who opens a discrepancy.
            6.1.1.1.4. The QAM then tracks the discrepancy through the Discrepancy Tracking Report.
            6.1.1.1.5. Report results of the CR if requested by higher headquarters.

6.2. Good Ideas and Initiatives. The financial management network consists of very talented individu-
als who come up with great ideas and initiatives to improve their local operations. “Positive” cross-feed
items will, therefore, be provided to the QAM on a routine basis. The QAM role in this regard is three-
fold.
     6.2.1. Search for solutions from other sources.
     6.2.2. Distribute the information to the right people.
     6.2.3. Forward good ideas from your local operations so others can benefit.

6.3. Local Cross-Feed Program. The QAM is encouraged to develop a local cross-feed program inde-
pendent from the Air Force distributed program. The way to do this is to search for reports or products
that can be shared locally within the comptroller organization.

                                FRAUD PREVENTION MEASURES

7.1. General. The QAM is the focal point for fraud and prevention in the FM organization. The follow-
ing paragraphs describe these responsibilities and functions. See the QA Manager’s Handbook for more
specific details in how to actually perform these duties.
   7.1.1. Education. There are several methods to use throughout the year in raising and maintaining
   fraud awareness.
       7.1.1.1. Schedule FM newcomers for introductory briefings on local fraud prevention measures.
       7.1.1.2. Ensure all personnel complete any Fraud Prevention tutorial programs available.
       7.1.1.3. Schedule semi-annual Fraud, Waste, and Abuse briefings.
       7.1.1.4. Distribute fraud newsletters or other cross-fed items relating to fraud.

7.2. Internal Reviews. Semi-annually, an audit will be performed and documented on all assigned FM
personnel. The purpose is to ensure only authorized and proper payments are made. The Financial Ser-
vices Officer performs the audit that includes the following.
   7.2.1. A review of military pay data for all FM military personnel using Pay Record Accessibility
   procedures outline in DFAS-DEM 7073.1.
   7.2.2. A review of civilian pay data for all FM civilian personnel.
   7.2.3. A review of travel payments for all FM personnel to include their dependents and relatives.
   7.2.4. A review of User Ids and passwords to ensure that following: personnel have only the autho-
   rized level of access; access to multiple systems is justified; passwords are changed timely; and user
   accounts for departing (reassignment, separation, or retirement) personnel are purged.

7.3. Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Review. Monthly, the QAM will compare manual changes (i.e.
initiated for travel payments only) shown on the management report to the actual document signed by the
customer. The QAM contacts a random sample of individuals to verify the change was authorized. Dis-
crepancies are reported immediately to the Financial Services Officer.

7.4. Post Audit. The purpose of the post audit is to conduct a random sample of completed transactions
to validate authenticity.
   7.4.1. Pay Affecting Documents. Quarterly, the QAM will review 100 documents from outside
   sources (Housing Office, Unit Commanders, etc.) and 100 documents generated locally
   (over-the-counter entitlement starts, local payments, etc.). The QAM verifies supporting documenta-
   tion and approving official signatures. A report is provided to the Financial Services Officer.
   7.4.2. Travel Vouchers. Quarterly, the QAM reviews 100 paid travel vouchers. The QAM verifies
   authenticated and proper travel orders support the payment. A report is provided to the Financial Ser-
   vices Officer.

                                        “IN-HOUSE” TRAINING

8.1. General. QA identifies potential weaknesses or problems while training improves overall perfor-
mance. QAMs should, therefore, also have the role of FM Training Managers. The training referred to in
this chapter is not the “upgrade” or external type of training. Rather, the focus of this chapter is on the
“in-house” training program. If the FM chooses not to appoint the QAM as in-house training manager,
the requirements described below are still applicable.

8.2. Role of QAM in Training. The QAM should facilitate the identification of training requirements,
ensure training is conducted and documented, and validate training sessions to ensure they are effective.

8.3. Determining what topics to train on. Determining training topics is a process based on several fac-
tors.
     8.3.1. New Procedures. FM functions change over time. When those changes occur, training should
     be scheduled to ensure employees understand the changes and have an opportunity to ask questions in
     a less stressful environment.
     8.3.2. Updated systems. “Upgrades” to financial automated systems are a fact of life. When these
     systems changes are brought on-line, a training session should be scheduled with a “dummy” database
     whenever possible. Workers learn better by making mistakes in a safe environment.
     8.3.3. Computer application courses. Whenever possible, seek to schedule classes that improve gen-
     eral computer knowledge and skills. If an “in-house: systems office exits, they can supplement com-
     puter training.
     8.3.4. Performance Deficiencies. A prime source for training topics are the discrepancies noted in
     various reviews (self-inspection checklists, QARs, etc.). The QAM should ensure that as discrepan-
     cies are identified a corresponding training session should be conducted. Note that training classes
     were conducted for all four-example scenarios (figure 8.3. sample training report).
     8.3.5. Orientation training. QA will provide newcomers with a short orientation to the FM mission,
     organizational structure, responsibilities of the different sections, and an overview of the QA and
     Training programs.
     8.3.6. Use of self-inspection checklists. Another valuable source for training topics is the area’s
     self-inspection review checklists. A checklist question or two can be given to personnel in the work
     areas (especially young enlisted technicians). Task them to assist in preparing and presenting a train-
     ing class on that specific area of the checklist.

8.4. Building a Training Plan. Based on inputs received, the QAM prepares a monthly training plan that
summarizes what topics are scheduled for in-house training (figure 8.1.). The plan should be provided to
the FM and staff for review and an opportunity to suggest any additional training topics.

8.5. Producing a Training Report. Also, the QAM produces a monthly training report that confirms
what training sessions indeed took place (figure 8.2.). It should be compared to the training plan to deter-
mine if scheduled training is occurring.

 Summary for November 1997
 14 training classes originally scheduled
 16 training classes actually completed

8.6. Where to Conduct Training. Whenever possible, training should be conducted away from the
work environment. A training room should be designated that is neat, conducive to a professional training
environment, and has adequate resources to conduct a training session (marker board, overhead projector,
etc.).

8.7. Who Trains. Experienced personnel who are able to effectively communicate with other co-workers
should teach training sessions.

8.8. Documentation. The following documentation should be turned in to the QAM upon completion of
the training session, Attendance sheet signed by all that attended the session, topic overview sheet that
lists objectives, and lesson plans developed.

8.9. Validating Training Effectiveness. The last step in ensuring that training is effective is for the
QAM to “validate” training sessions on a random basis. Why is this important? Too often, training pro-

grams fail to meet their objectives. As the “eyes and ears” for the Comptroller, the QAM randomly
selects and attends training sessions to determine that (1) training sessions are in fact occurring, and (2)
that the sessions are productive.
   8.9.1. The QAM makes an objective assessment on the effectiveness of training sessions through the
   use of a training validation sheet (figure 8.3.). The validation “closes the loop” on the training pro-
   gram for the FM.

  Training Session: Receiving Reports – Requirements for Proper Payments
  Date/Time: 30 Nov 98/0900
  Trainer: SrA Robertson
  Overall Evaluation:     Excellent X     Fair __    Marginal __     Unsatisfactory __
  Comments: I sat in on the training sessions on receiving report requirements for proper payments. The
  session was scheduled at a convenient time for personnel and was conducted in the training room. SrA
  Robertson gave a concise training session on the subject. He distributed copies of the message, which
  stated the seven requirements for a proper receiving report. He went over each item and gave examples
  of proper and improper documentation. SrA Robertson then ended his session with numerous exam-
  ples and asked the class to determine if the receiving report was proper or not. Well done!

                                THE QUALITY ASSURANCE PLAN

9.1. General. A Quality Assurance plan becomes the means to capture many of the elements of the QA
Program itself. Prepared annually, the QAM and FM staff chart out what areas will be covered during the
fiscal year. The QA plan is frequently modified, however, as the “process tools” capture and record any
problems, discrepancies, or improvement opportunities. The plan should be reviewed monthly with man-
agement to ensure all planned activities are carried out. Planned items should not “slip” indefinitely. See
Figure 9.1. for an example of a QA plan.

                                          RECOGNITION

10.1. General. Use the data produced by QA to recognize your top performers! Performance tracking
through indicators or reviews provides the opportunity to recognize “good work”. The QAMs assist the
FMs in nominating comptroller personnel for as many awards as possible when warranted.
   10.1.1. Develop internal recognition programs too. A monthly “team of the month” award or “excep-
   tional performer” recognition for individuals boosts morale since management takes the time to notice
   good performance. Whenever possible, cash incentives for civilian employees or time off for military
   should be presented at staff or QA meetings.

10.2. Annual Financial Management Awards. The QAM will be responsible for ensuring nomination
packages are completed and forwarded to MAJCOM/FOA/DRU FMs IAW AFI 36-2846.

Audit—An independent review of operations from an audit staff to determine compliance with applicable
laws and regulations. Normally, the auditors will schedule an in brief with the appropriate staff to
announce the scope of their audits. The actual review may be divided into several stages; the first stage to
determine what should be occurring per laws and regulations; and the second stage to evaluate if it is in
fact taking place. The auditors will usually provide at least an informal evaluation of any findings and
recommendations when they leave and send out a final report. Significant audit reports that take place at
other installations will be “cross-fed” to all the QAMs to determine if a similar problem exists at their

organization.
Compliance Review (CR)—A “processing tool” that a QAM can use to quickly determine if a problem
exists in a processing center using a small sample size of data.
Compliance Review Schedule—A suggested timeframe when to conduct a CR.
Cross-feed Program—Program to distribute both “problem” cases and good initiatives thoughout the
Air Force Accounting and Finance network to all installations.
Discrepancy Tracking—The method of capturing “problems” or “discrepancies” and ensuring they are
worked until a resolution is in place.
Discrepancy Tracking Medium—Any number of methods (i.e., spreadsheets, databases, word
processing documents, MAJCOM forms, etc.) used to record the discrepancy, the processing center where
the discrepancy exists, the root cause of the problem and the corrective action to fix the problem or
discrepancy. Each discrepancy is numbered by the QAM but the section chiefs are responsible for
ensuring corrective actions are implemented.
Discrepancy Tracking Report—A monthly report given to the Comptroller and key staff that
summarizes all discrepancies in the Comptroller organization. The purpose of the report is to provide the
Comptroller a management tool of how many discrepancies have been opened, closed, or remain open
past the estimated completion date.
Flight Chief—Normally the Chief of Financial Management Analysis (FMA) or the Financial Services
Officer.
Fraud Prevention—Efforts to prevent fraud from occurring in either the Comptroller organization or on
the base community itself.
Internal Controls—A process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of
objectives in (1) reliability of financial reporting, (2) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and (3)
compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Performance Indicators—A means (usually graphic) of displaying actual performance in a critical area
against a certain goal and standard. The indicators are usually color coded to quickly determine if goals
and standards are being met or not (green, yellow, and red). Performance indicators are reviewed at QA
meeting or staff meeting. Higher headquarters may also request performance indicators be tracked and
reported.
Process Action Team (PAT)—A means of identifying “improvement opportunities” to a work process.
The team is comprised of various members that are part of the process itself. A facilitator ensures that
PAT meetings are scheduled and that the group stays focused to meet objectives in a timely manner.
Processing Center—A work section in the Comptroller organization (i.e. Customer Support, Customer
Service, Accounting Liaison office, etc.).
Quality Assurance Bulletin (QAB)—A bulletin distributed by the Air Force Accounting and Finance
Office (AFAFO) for the base Quality Assurance Managers and the comptroller organizations. The
bulletins are a quick means to distribute pertinent information regarding the Quality Assurance Program.
QABs are numbered sequentially and maintained on the QA website.
Quality Assurance Manager (QAM)—The person designated to provide administrative oversight of the
Quality Assurance Program and to promote quality consciousness among unit personnel.
24                                                               AFI65-202 16 NOVEMBER 2000

Organizationally, reports to the Comptroller.
Quality Assurance Plan—An annual tool to schedule routine and periodic Quality Assurance functions.
The QA plan is produced at the beginning of each fiscal year and is approved by the base Comptroller.
The plan should be reviewed monthly with the Comptroller too ensure scheduled reviews or tasking are
being completed or amended as new requirements dictate.
Quality Assurance Program (QAP)—A comprehensive program designed to ensure effective and
efficient financial management and strong internal controls.
Quality Assurance Review (QAR)—A review performed by the QA Manager or individual appointed
by the FM to determine if a problem exists, what the root cause(s) of the problem are, and
recommendations to correct the deficiency or problem. The QAR includes an in brief and out-brief with
the Comptroller and the applicable processing center chief.
Quality Assurance Website—Site maintained by the AFAFO to distribute information and guidance to
the base QAMs.
Training Program (In-house)—An ongoing effort to train Comptroller personnel through local
resources. The QAM consolidates training topics received by the processing centers and produces a
monthly training plan and training report.
Training Validation—The QAM determines that scheduled training sessions take place and are effective
by actually attending training sessions.
