SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Table 1. is expanded to include compliance items governing personnel management records and all refer-
ences to compliance items updated. Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information is
added.


1. General:
   1.1. C&SRL items are defined by the ACC staff and based upon guidance governing the particular
   C&SRL area of focus. This guidance may include existing “by-law” requirements, Executive Orders,
2                                                               ACCDIR90-2355 22 FEBRUARY 2008


    DoD directives, AF, ACC and ANG instructions, and mission areas deemed critical by AF or ACC/
    ANG leadership to assessing and assuring unit organizational health and/or performance. The objec-
    tive of the C&SRL is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities. As a
    minimum, units should use these directories in conjunction with the annual unit self inspections or
    unit directed inspections.
    1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCOs) represent the highest priority of inspection items and are
    fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCAs). Lower tier Core and
    General Compliance Items may be stand-alone or subordinate to a CCO. During the HQ ACC/IG Unit
    Compliance Inspection (UCI) process, unit self inspections or unit directed inspections, it is the intent
    of the local evaluation team to inspect, as a minimum, 100% of the CCOs that apply to the inspected
    unit. However, C&SRL items listed do not limit the scope of the inspection. Critical, core and general
    compliance criteria are defined as follows:
       1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). Items where the unit’s failure to comply with estab-
       lished guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or serious injury, or significant
       mission impact. Key mission areas include:
       - Airman development programs
       - Ability to deploy forces
       - Ability to employ forces
       CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.
       1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). An item or area that require special vigilance and is impor-
       tant to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical". Non-compliance would
       result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result in injury, unnecessary cost,
       or possible litigations. CCIs are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT.
       1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). An item or area deemed fundamental to successful overall
       performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal impact on mission accom-
       plishment or would be unlikely to result in injury, increased cost, or possible litigation. GCIs are
       shown in sentence case format.
