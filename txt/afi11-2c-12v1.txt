                                          GENERAL

1.1. Training Objective. This instruction prescribes basic policy and guidance for training C-
12 crewmembers according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1. The overall objective of the aircrew
training program is to develop and maintain a high state of mission readiness for immediate and
effective employment in exercises, peacekeeping operations, contingencies, and war. If a
conflict is identified between this AFI and AFI 11-202, comply with AFI 11-202 and notify
AFMC/A3V (see paragraph 1.3.1).
1.2. Key Words Explained.
   1.2.1. "Will" and "shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.2.2. "Should" is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
   accomplishment.
   1.2.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.2.4. "Note" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered essential
   to emphasize.
1.3. Administration.
   1.3.1. Recommendation for Change. Submit suggested improvements to this instruction
   on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, through MAJCOM channels
   according to AFI 11-215, Flight Manual Program (FMP). Send proposals for amending
   existing course prerequisites or recommendations to change or delete obsolete courseware
   through the appropriate MAJCOM training staff to the office of primary responsibility (OPR)
   (HQ AFMC/A3V).
   1.3.2. Supplements. This AFI is a basic directive. Each MAJCOM may supplement this
   AFI. MAJCOM supplements may be more, but not less restrictive than this instruction.
   MAJCOM may set training requirements lower than specified in this instruction when the
   statement “or as specified in MAJCOM supplement” is indicated as applicable to that item or
   event. MAJCOM (or equivalent) supplements must be coordinated with HQ AFMC/A3V
   and HQ AF/A3O-AT in accordance with (IAW) AFPD 11-2 and AFI 11-202, Volume 1,
   before publication.
1.4. Responsibilities. AFI 11-202, Volume 1, delineates responsibilities for aircrew training.
   1.4.1. Command and Control.            When “MAJCOMs, Operations Groups, and
   Squadrons/Units” are referenced in this AFI and users do not fall under this organizational
   structure then the equivalent agency or unit will be substituted. For the purposes of this
   regulation, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) is considered a MAJCOM and the Chief,
   DIA Air and Maritime Operations, is equivalent to an Air Force operations group
   commander.
   1.4.2. Lead Command. Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) is designated lead
   command for the C-12 MDS as specified in AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation and
   Responsibilities for Weapon Systems.

    1.4.3. Training Command. AFMC is tasked with providing C-12 formal training.
       1.4.3.1. Progress Review (PR). IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1. AFMC/A3V will notify
       the student’s gaining unit of PR action. If the PR recommends a Flying Evaluation
       Board, AFMC/A3V will notify the student’s gaining MAJCOM.
       1.4.3.2. Post-Graduate Critiques. The C-12 Formal Schoolhouse located at Edwards
       AFB will manage Aircrew Post-Graduate Critiques. Gaining unit commanders may
       request completed surveys by contacting the Formal Training Unit (FTU). The purpose
       of the critiques is to ensure the quality and effectiveness of training provided by the FTU.
    1.4.4. MAJCOMs.
       1.4.4.1. Theater Indoctrination Training. MAJCOMs will develop theater
       indoctrination training and ensure aircrews are trained for specific theater flight
       operations IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 1.
       1.4.4.2. Recall Procedures. Requests to recall students from a formal school course
       must be sent from the student’s MAJCOM to HQ AFMC/A3V. Emergency recall during
       non-duty hours may be coordinated directly with the student with notification to the HQ
       AFMC/A3V on the next duty day.
    1.4.5. Operations Groups. The Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) is responsible for
    squadron/unit training as follows:
       1.4.5.1. Conducting Training Review Panel (TRP) on a calendar semiannual period
       (frequency may be increased as required). The TRP should review staff and aircrew
       management actions necessary to complete flight and ground training (GT) programs.
          1.4.5.1.1. TRP topics may include, but are not limited to, current and forecast
          Ground/Flight Training Levels, (GTL/FTL), Upgrade and Continuation Training
          status, Semiannual requirement completion rates, crew position gains/losses, Aircraft
          Commander, Instructor and Evaluator upgrades. Units should also review all unit
          defined training “X” events for relevancy.
    1.4.6. Squadrons/Units.
       1.4.6.1. The Unit/CC will ensure crewmembers complete training in accordance with
       Table 1.1 In-Unit Training Time Limitations. Failure to progress may require removal
       from training.
       1.4.6.2. Assign FTL, GTL, and qualification/certification (evaluator, instructor, etc.) to
       crewmembers before each semiannual training period. Base Training Level (TL)
       assignments on experience and aircraft proficiency. Use the date of the initial
       qualification evaluation for determining an individual’s time in the weapon system.
       1.4.6.3. Ensure adequate training continuity and supervision of assigned and attached
       crewmembers. Unit commanders may assign additional requirements based on

2.5. Conversion/Differences Qualification Training Requirements. When possible, qualified
personnel in other units will provide the initial cadre. In some instances, it will be necessary for
units to form an initial cadre of aircrew personnel for whom certain training qualification
requirements may be waived. The following conditions will apply to the management of initial
cadre aircrew qualification:
   2.5.1. Conversion Training. Form a nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel
   (initial cadre) to begin aircrew conversion. Send waiver request of PAA time through
   MAJCOM training staff following the format in paragraph 1.5 Additionally, include the
   most recent aircraft flown and total time in that aircraft in the JUSTIFICATION section.
       2.5.1.1. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held
       unless previously qualified in the conversion aircraft.
       2.5.1.2. After final approval, publish a unit letter to identify initial cadre of instructors
       and flight examiners by crew qualification.
   2.5.2. Difference Training. C-12 units should apply Difference Qualification Training
   (DQT) for major modifications (i.e., glass cockpit modification) as directed by MAJCOM.
   For fleet-wide modifications, apply initial cadre criteria in paragraph 2.5.1. HQ
   AFMC/A3V, in coordination with other MAJCOM will provide guidance and oversight.
   2.5.3. At the discretion of the unit CC, MC-12 pilots requiring qualification in the C-12 may
   be treated as a first assignment UPT graduate with C-12/T-44 syllabus hours IAW Table 2.1
   Note 1, and complete in-unit FP qualification.
       2.5.3.1. MC-12 pilots qualifying in the C-12 shall comply with AFI 11-202 Vol 1. The
       C-12 Refresher Simulator (G250) may be used in lieu of a formal C-12 initial
       qualification course if used in conjunction with an in-unit qualification. A qualification
       flight evaluation is required.
2.6. Multiple Qualifications. The C-12C/D/F/J are considered the same MDS. AFI 11-202,
Volume 1 identifies multiple aircraft qualification requirements. Crewmembers will attend a
formal initial qualification course for dual qualification in different MDS aircraft. Crewmembers
maintaining dual qualification will, as a minimum, maintain FTL A currency requirements in
each aircraft. EXCEPTION: Senior Officers; see paragraph 2.7
   2.6.1. The MC-12 and the C-12 are not the same MDS.
2.7. Senior Officer Qualification Training Requirements. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 identifies
senior officer qualification requirements. These officers will be assigned FTL E for continuation
training purposes and will not fly unsupervised in a primary crew position (see paragraph
4.3.2.5).
   2.7.1. After qualification IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and with OG/CC approval, senior
   officers (assigned or attached) may seek training which leads to a higher FTL and/or
   qualification. The unit’s training office is responsible for determining training requirements
   based on the senior officer’s flying experience. HQ AFMC/A3V or appropriate MAJCOM
   A3T will approve the proposed training plan prior to execution.
2.8. Flight Surgeons. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 establishes flight surgeon initial qualification
requirements.
AFI11-2C-12V1 14 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 13


2.9. Requalification Training. Complete requalification training in accordance with AFI 11-
202, Volume 1.

                               MISSION READY TRAINING

3.1. Description. This chapter establishes minimum criteria and training requirements for
attaining Mission Ready (MR) status. Except where specifically stated, units may arrange
mission sequence or sequence of items as necessary to use flying training hours effectively and
accomplish the unit mission.
3.2. Time Periods for Certification Training. Crewmembers will complete mission
qualification training as specified in paragraph 1.7 and Table 1.1 or as specified in MAJCOM
supplements. Completion of all ground training requirements in Table 3.1 and flying training
requirements in paragraph 3.4 will result in a crewmember being Mission Ready (MR).
3.3. Ground Training (GT) Requirements. All crewmembers will accomplish events in
Table 3.1 All ground training will be completed before certification in the unit operational
mission (not applicable for senior officers or staff officers maintaining BAQ).
   3.3.1. GT accomplished during mission qualification establishes due dates for subsequent
   continuation training. Completion of Combat Survival Training (SS20 or SS22), Water
   Survival Training (SS32), and Life Support Equipment Training (LL06) during formal school
   establishes the due date (based on date of first completed course) for recurring Combat
   Survival (SS02) and Water Survival (SS05) training. Completion of SS20 establishes the due
   date for recurring Law of Armed Conflict (G100) and Force Protection (G110) training.
   3.3.2. Any DoD component approved equivalent training meets the requirement for G005,
   G006, G280, SS02, SS03, and SS05. For example, a Marine pilot may take credit for
   completing Navy Water Survival and the completion date of that event will be used to
   establish the date next due for SS05.

AFI11-2C-12V1 14 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 17


                                           Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Description. This chapter establishes the minimum flying and related GT requirements to
maintain currency. The unit commander will ensure crewmembers receive sufficient
continuation training to maintain individual proficiency.
4.2. Aircrew Status. C-12 crewmembers are assigned MR, BMC, BAQ, or Non-Mission Ready
status (NMR).
   4.2.1. MR. For Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS), operational tasking, and
   deployments, a MR crewmember is defined as one who is available, current and qualified or
   certified in the unit’s mission (completed mission qualification/certification training). FTU
   instructors must be qualified in the training unit mission before performing instructor duties.
       4.2.1.1. Crewmembers must be current in all ground and flying training events, except
       special mission qualification events that will not adversely impact the unit’s wartime
       mission.
   4.2.2. BMC. A non-mission-ready crewmember assigned to MAJCOM headquarters,
   numbered Air Force (NAF), Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC), Air Mobility Warfare
   Center (AMWC), Contingency Readiness Wing (CRW), Air Mobility operations group
   (AMOG), formal schoolhouse, or direct reporting unit who has satisfactorily completed
   mission qualification training and does not maintain MR status, but maintains familiarization
   in the command or unit operational mission. The crewmember may maintain qualification in
   some aspects of the unit mission and is able to attain full qualification in the unit mission
   within 45 days. See note after paragraph 4.3.2.1 for Training Level requirement. BMC
   crew-members may log instructor or evaluator time for the portion of the mission for which
   they are current and qualified. Otherwise, they will log Flight Qualified Pilot (FP) time.
   4.2.3. BAQ. A pilot that has satisfactorily completed initial qualification training and is
   qualified to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft.
   4.2.4. NMR. An individual who is non-current or unqualified in the aircraft, incomplete in
   required continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission is a NMR
   crewmember.
       4.2.4.1. If a crewmember is NMR for failure to complete required continuation training,
       OG/CC has two options:
          4.2.4.1.1. Waive the required training in accordance with paragraph 4.9.1 or 4.9.2.
          The individual remains on MR status.
          4.2.4.1.2. Place the crewmember in supervised status according to paragraph
          4.2.4.2.
       4.2.4.2. If the crewmember is NMR for failure to maintain currency per paragraph
       4.9.1, place the crewmember in supervised status for that event (individual flies with an
       instructor of like specialty) until required training is accomplished. EXCEPTION: Non-
       current crewmembers may fly unsupervised on local, routine, and non-contingency
 18                                                    AFI11-2C-12V1 14 FEBRUARY 2013


      missions on which events in the delinquent category are not accomplished (OG/CC
      approval not required).
   4.2.5. In addition to the above, MR, BMC, and BAQ crewmembers must have accomplished
   and/or maintained the requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 1 for their respective status, as
   well as all events listed in the applicable ground and semiannual flying continuation tables.
4.3. Training Levels.
   4.3.1. The Unit/CC determines the TL (see paragraph 1.4.6.2) before each semiannual
   period. Assign new unit crewmembers a TL during in-processing. Base the TL on
   experience and proficiency. Crewmembers may be assigned a TL that is more restrictive, but
   never less restrictive, than the requirements under this paragraph.
   4.3.2. Flying Training Levels (FTL):
      4.3.2.1. FTL A--Highly experienced crewmembers with a minimum of 120 gate months
      (or equivalent for non-AF pilots) and a minimum 1,500 total flying hours. This may
      include MR or NMR MAJCOM headquarters, FTU instructors, NAF personnel, Wg/CC,
      OG/CC, and Unit/CC, operations officers, OG-level evaluators, and any instructors
      assigned primarily to staff duties. NOTE: NMR crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM
      headquarters, NAF, or a direct reporting unit are categorized as BMC and assigned to
      FTL A and GTL 4. In addition to GTL 4 requirements, these individuals must also
      accomplish annual CRM training requirements. These individuals may fly unsupervised
      on training missions provided they are current and qualified. They require instructor
      supervision on all other missions. If refresher SIM training requirements are not met, the
      individual must fly with an instructor of like specialty unless waived (see paragraph
      4.9).
      4.3.2.2. FTL B--Experienced, mission ready crewmembers with a minimum of 60 gate
      months (or equivalent for non-AF pilots) and a minimum of 750 total flight hours.
      4.3.2.3. FTL C--MR crewmembers.
      4.3.2.4. FTL D--BAQ crewmembers. Designated primarily for individuals pursuing MR
      status after initial qualification training.
      4.3.2.5. FTL E--BAQ, non-instructor staff (may include senior officers, MAJCOM, and
      NAF individuals that are not maintaining MR or instructor status). FTL E requirements
      are insufficient for MR status. Crewmembers assigned to FTL E will fly with an
      instructor of like specialty at all times.
   4.3.3. Ground Training Levels (GTL):
      4.3.3.1. GTL 1--Highly experienced crewmembers with a minimum of 120 gate months
      (or equivalent for non-AF pilots) and a minimum 1,500 total flying hours.
      4.3.3.2. GTL 2--Experienced crewmembers with a minimum of 60 gate months (or
      equivalent for non-AF pilots) and a minimum of 750 total flight hours.
      4.3.3.3. GTL 3--Crewmembers not meeting the time or flight hour requirements of GTL
      1 or GTL 2 or the definition of GTL 4.
AFI11-2C-12V1 14 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                19


      4.3.3.4. GTL 4--NMR senior officers, staff officers, and those not required to maintain
      MR status.
   4.3.4. Change of FTL or GTL. Once the semiannual period begins, personnel should not be
   moved to a level requiring fewer events. EXCEPTION: BAQ crewmembers may be placed
   in a different FTL any time after attaining MR status or completion of upgrade to next higher
   crew position. Prorate events IAW paragraph 4.8 upon changing training levels.
4.4. Training Events/Tables. Standardized ARMS training event identifiers and descriptions
are located in Chapter 7. Unit defined events will be designated “X” events (i.e. X020).
   4.4.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment:
      4.4.1.1. In addition to events accomplished on training and operational missions, those
      flight events accomplished on a satisfactory qualification, mission qualification,
      specialized mission qualification, or requalification evaluation may be credited towards
      the individual’s currency requirements and to establish subsequent due dates.
      4.4.1.2. Crewmembers who are unqualified in the aircraft due to an unsatisfactory flight
      evaluation will not log continuation training requirements for events graded Q-3 IAW
      AFI 11-2C-12, Volume 2, Aircrew Evaluation Criteria, until re-qualified.
      4.4.1.3. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training
      period.
      4.4.1.4. Simulator Credit for Training Events. Crewmembers may credit events
      accomplished in the SIM unless otherwise specified by the respective event description in
      Chapter 7 or Table 4.4 SIM events may be credited for currency events in Table 4.4
      Pilots may maintain or regain currency events accomplished in the SIM. Pilots assigned
      to FTL C, D, or E may log no more than half of their semiannual events in the simulator.
      Instructor upgrade simulator training may be credited for annual refresher simulator.
      4.4.1.5. Instructor Training Requirements and Responsibilities. Instructors and flight
      examiners may credit 50% of their requirements while instructing or evaluating.
      EXCEPTION: Instructor and flight examiner pilots may not credit any takeoffs or
      landings flown by another pilot.
4.5. Continuation Training Requirements.
   4.5.1. Ground Continuation Training Requirements.         Crewmembers will comply with
   requirements of Table 4.1 and Table 4.2
      4.5.1.1. Failure to accomplish events in Table 4.1 will result in non-mission ready status.
      See paragraph 4.9 for regaining mission ready status.
          4.5.1.1.1. Local training missions may be flown before completing all MR items,
          provided Flight Physical (G005), Physiological Training (G006), Life Support
          Familiarization Training (LL01), Emergency Egress Training (LL03), and Marshaling
          Exam (G002) are accomplished.
      4.5.1.2. Failure to complete mobility training requirements in Table 4.2 will not result in
      non-mission ready status but may restrict member from certain missions.
 20                                                      AFI11-2C-12V1 14 FEBRUARY 2013


       4.5.1.3. Ancillary training events do not affect mission ready status nor restrict
       crewmembers from any mission.
       4.5.1.4. Crewmembers may accomplish GT events while TDY. Individuals are
       responsible for reporting accomplished training to their unit of attachment ARMS office.
       4.5.1.5. Flight Surgeons shall comply with requirements of Table 4.3
       4.5.1.6. Record all training events in the ARMS database.
          4.5.1.6.1. Combined events may have only one consolidated ARMS entry.
          4.5.1.6.2. One-time events in the ARMS database need not be maintained on the
          individual currency report.

 NOTES:
 A-Annual, M-Monthly, Q-Quarterly
 1. Requirement is for Aircraft Commander and above. Authorized for FP in training for or certified in
 tactical arrival and departure (TAD). Once certification is complete, FP incurs the semiannual
 requirement.
 2. Units with appropriately equipped aircraft.
 3. Perform in conjunction with LL04 when practicable.
 4. PACAF assigned and gained units in Alaska may substitute “180d” for “Q”
 5. Requirement determined by MAJCOM.
 6. Only applicable to crewmembers certified for these maneuvers.
 7. SIM credit for this event is only allowed for pilots assigned FTL A or B.


4.6. Flight Surgeon Continuation Flying Requirements. Flight surgeons will comply with
AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
4.7. Training Period. Continuation training program is based on static 6-month periods (1
January – 30 June and 1 July – 31 December). MAJCOM may adjust training periods based on
unique mission requirements.
4.8. Proration of Training. AFI 11-202 Volume 1 describes proration of training requirements
for crew-members not available for flying duties. In addition, prorate training for non-
availability due to contingency alerts and contingency TDYs when the contingency precludes
training for certain mission events.
   4.8.1. Use this formula to determine training requirements: number of months available
   times the event volume divided by the number of months in the training period. Round down
   to the nearest whole number, but not less than 1 (e.g. 5.6 rounds to 5).
       4.8.1.1. Use Table 4.5 to determine the number of months available. Prorate only if
       absence is at least 15-cumulative days.
       4.8.1.2. When an individual has a PCS during the training cycle to a unit flying the same
       model aircraft and enters the same FTL or lower, credit training accomplished at the
       previous base. Prorate training requirements based on the time available (e.g., time at
       former base, plus time at new base, minus number of days not available) during the
       training period. Time available starts 7-days after sign-in for continental United States
       (CONUS), 14-days after sign-in for OCONUS or on the date of actual accomplishment of
 26                                                      AFI11-2C-12V1 14 FEBRUARY 2013


         the first training event, whichever occurs first. Subtract previous accomplishments from
         the prorated total to determine remaining requirements.
   4.8.2. Units may also prorate requirements for individuals changing training levels.

4.9. Failure to Complete Continuation Training Requirements. Declare individuals NMR if
they fail to complete ground or semiannual flying continuation training requirements. The
following guidance applies:
   4.9.1. Flight Training. At the end of each training period, the Unit/CC will review ARMS
   products for those crewmembers who failed to accomplish all required flying training events
   (includes all events listed in the flying continuation training tables). The Unit/CC will either
   direct training necessary for the individual to regain MR status or request OG/CC waiver.
   The same flying training events will not be waived for two consecutive training periods.
   Events denoted with a specific period of time (monthly, quarterly, or maximum days between
   accomplishments) in the currency (CUR) column of Table 4.4 may only be waived under
   extreme circumstances and only at the MAJCOM level.
         4.9.1.1. Loss of Currency. Place individuals delinquent in any flying currency event in
         supervised training status for that event and declare them NMR. Crewmembers are non-
         current the day after event currency expires; (i.e., a crewmember that accomplished an
         event with monthly currency on 1 September becomes non-current on 1 November).
         4.9.1.2. Regaining Currency.
            4.9.1.2.1. For loss of currency up to 6 months. A crewmember must demonstrate
            proficiency in the aircraft with an instructor in all delinquent items. Crewmembers
            non-current for up to 6-months will maintain their current training level (no training
            folder required).
            4.9.1.2.2. For loss of currency exceeding 6 months. For flying currency events
            identified in Table 4.4, the crewmember is unqualified in the aircraft and must
            complete requalification training and an aircrew evaluation.
AFI11-2C-12V1 14 FEBRUARY 2013                                                            27


  4.9.2. The OG/CC or equivalent may waive ground continuation training events identified in
  Table 4.1, Table 4.2, and Table 4.3. The decision to grant a waiver will be based on the
  individual crewmember’s experience and proficiency level (i.e. waivers will not be based on
  a crewmember’s availability). OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the
  waiver. Do not waiver events that degrade mission accomplishment.
  4.9.3. Individual’s non-current in Hazardous Cargo Training (G182) may fly unsupervised
  on missions that do not transport hazardous cargo.

       section of subjects from applicable directives. Briefings may be conducted as part of the
       existing continuation training or flying safety program, but the briefing must be critiqued
       by a same crew position instructor for content, organization, and delivery.
 30                                                       AFI11-2C-12V1 14 FEBRUARY 2013


           5.3.3.1.1. The instructor candidate shall know how to utilize training documentation
           described in Attachment 2.
       5.3.3.2. Flying Training. IP candidates may occupy either seat during training. Emphasis
       will be on right-seat proficiency, maneuver techniques, practice instruction, CRM
       principals, practical emergency situation set-up, and operating aircraft systems. A
       minimum of one touch and go landing should be accomplished in the left seat,
       emphasizing the differences in cockpit layout and aircrew duties that affect left seat
       instructing.
           5.3.3.2.1. If at any time during the flight, the judgment or proficiency of a student at
           the controls raises a question in the instructor's mind as to the student's ability to
           complete a prescribed maneuver safely, the instructor will take over the controls of
           the aircraft immediately. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate proper
           methods of conducting the maneuver prior to the student resuming control of the
           aircraft.
   5.3.4. On completion of instructor qualification training, IP candidates will be validated by
   an evaluation and a certification board. Pilots will not be IP coded until certified by the unit
   commander.
5.4. Flight Examiner Certification. Unit/CC will recommend instructors for flight examiner
certification. Instructors identified for certification as flight examiners must possess satisfactory
knowledge of MAJCOM training and evaluation policies and procedures and the ability to
administer an evaluation according to AFI 11-2C-12, Volume 2.
   5.4.1. Flight examiner candidates will complete a flight examiner certification course.

                          AIRCREW TRAINING SYSTEM (ATS)

6.1. Description. ATS contractors may provide academic and SIM training. The Air Force or
ATS contractor can provide flight training. Air Force evaluator pilots normally administer end-
of-course evaluations but qualified ATS evaluators may conduct evaluations if necessary.
6.2. Applicability. This chapter applies to all crewmembers attending formal schools using
ATS courseware. AFMC/A3V manages the content of C-12 contractor provided training.
Students do not have the authority to levy requirements on ATS contractors.
6.3. Dedicated Training Time. It is imperative that students complete their training in a timely
manner. Students will enroll on a full-time basis. Relieve students of duties not directly related
to training. EXCEPTION: Supervisory personnel may continue supervisory duties as time
permits.
6.4. ATS Course Prerequisites. Each ATS course is designed and based on student
prerequisites being met. Prerequisites may include a minimum number of flying hours, unit
operations officer recommendation, and completion of applicable training guides. Consult the
course summary document and ETCA to determine student entry level for each course.
6.5. Lesson Objectives.
   6.5.1. Lesson Objective Development.         All objectives must meet requirements of
   Instructional Systems Development (ISD) process as defined in Air Force Handbook (AFH)
   36-2235, Information for Designers of Instructional Systems.
   6.5.2. Lesson Objective Description. These are subject to changes in the contract and/or the
   formal course syllabus as applicable.
   6.5.3. Lesson Objective Use. Instructors and examiners use lesson objectives as a reference
   document to establish training and evaluation standards. Submit recommended changes
   through MAJCOM channels.
   6.5.4. Course Material. All student guides, training guides, line development guides, etc.,
   will be provided by the ATS contractor. Local procedures will be developed by unit training
   offices to ensure that students bring the current version of the course material to the start of
   each class.
       6.5.4.1. CRM Training:
           6.5.4.1.1. CRM Development. CRM trains crewmembers to cope with potential
           problems in human behavior affecting aircrew performance. Documented studies of
           aircraft accidents and additional data suggests most human behavior problems
           observed among aircrews could be grouped into six categories: communication,
           situational awareness, team leadership, mission analysis, decision-making process,
           and stress management.
           6.5.4.1.2. CRM Program. CRM is presented on a recurring basis throughout the
           ATS. Introduction to CRM is presented during initial qualification training and is
           embedded in recurring phase training.
 32                                                      AFI11-2C-12V1 14 FEBRUARY 2013


6.6. Unsatisfactory Student Progress.
   6.6.1. If a student's training progress is unsatisfactory, the contractor will notify the
   government representative. Following review of the student's record, the government
   representative will determine whether to continue or terminate training.
   6.6.2. The contractor will provide written feedback to the unit commander or training office
   for students who display substandard performance.
   6.6.3. Remediation Procedures. The contractor and contracting officer must receive prompt
   notification of unsatisfactory performance following a contracted course. Local procedures
   must ensure that notification is completed within 24 hours of failure to complete a course and
   within 48 hours after return to home station for OCONUS units. Remediation subsequent to
   a failed course completion may be the contractor's responsibility, Air Force's responsibility,
   or a joint responsibility, depending on the nature of failure. In every case, close coordination
   is required to achieve maximum trainee progress.
6.7. Courseware Changes. Submit courseware changes through appropriate MAJCOM
channels to AFMC/A3V.
   6.7.1. Master Task List (MTL) and Evaluation Standards Document (ESD).
       6.7.1.1. MTL/ESD Purpose. The MTL/ESD provides the basis for courseware
       development. The MTL/ESD, as approved by HQ AFMC/A3V, is the evaluation criteria
       for validating a crewmember’s performance. Flight examiners and instructors who
       evaluate or train crewmembers will use the MTL/ESD to determine the ability of an
       individual to meet the performance levels required to be mission qualified.
       6.7.1.2. MTL/ESD Use. The MTL/ESD will be used by instructors and flight examiners
       in the training and evaluation of crewmembers. Submit recommended changes through
       MAJCOM training channels to AFMC/A3V using an approved quality assurance change
       proposal (QACP) process. Changes to the MTL/ESD frequently result in changes to
       associated courseware.

   7.8.1. RS00 Tactical Arrival Event. A High Altitude or Low Altitude Tactical Arrival as
   specified in RS06 or RS16. Planning should focus on the tactical ingress during a fluid
   tactical scenario.
   7.8.2. RS06 High Altitude Tactical Arrival. These approaches are used primarily when
   high or medium altitude ingress is necessary. Crew members should practice high altitude
   tactical arrivals from 10,000 feet AGL and above. There are two basic types; the Spiral
   Down (Clean) and the Spiral Down (Configured).
   7.8.3. RS16 Low Altitude Tactical Arrival. These approaches are used primarily when
   low altitude ingress is necessary. These include the downwind, the overhead, the straight-in,
   teardrop, and abeam.
   7.8.4. RS20 Tactical Departure Event. Continuation training for mission ready crews in
   Tactical Departures. A High Altitude or Low Altitude Tactical Departure as specified in
   RS26 or RS36. Planning should focus on the tactical egress during a fluid tactical scenario.
   7.8.5. RS26 High-Altitude Tactical Departure. This maneuver is used primarily when a
   departure at medium to high altitude is necessary. The maneuver requires a spiral climbing
   departure.
   7.8.6. RS36 Low-Altitude Tactical Departure. This maneuver is used primarily when a
   departure at low altitude is necessary.
7.8.7. SS01 Local Area Survival. To identify environmental aspects that could affect an
aircrew member in a local area, survival scenario. Determine personnel recovery tactics,
techniques, and procedures applicable to local area flying operations. SS01 is a onetime
requirement, to be accomplished prior to the first flight at each base of assignment. Units may
combine and dual log with Life Support Familiarization Training (LL01). This course must be
taught by a FEO, a qualified instructor aircrew, or an AFE training instructor.
   7.8.8. SS02 Combat Survival Training (CST). Academic and field training designed for
   crewmembers whose duties may include overflight of or deployment to hostile territory.

                        AIRCREW TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

A2.1. General Information. This attachment provides guidelines on proper training
documentation. Instructions are provided for AF IMT 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, AF IMT
4023, Aircrew Training Progress Report, AF IMT 4024, Aircrew Training Accomplishment
Report, and AF IMT 4025, Aircrew Summary/Close-Out Report, and aircrew training guides
(TG).
   A2.1.1. Initiate an AF IMT 4022 or MAJCOM-approved pilot training guide (PTG), for
   ETCA formal training (either at formal school or in-unit), mission qualification, special
   qualification or certification training, in-unit upgrade program to the next higher crew
   qualification, requalification training (either at formal school or in-unit), or for any corrective
   action or additional training.
      A2.1.1.1. The unit operations officer may waive the training folder requirement if
      corrective action or additional training is limited. If initiated, the instructor or flight
      examiner who evaluated the crewmember's performance will enter comments pertinent to
      the training deficiency on AF IMT 4023 or the training guide. Use the existing training
      folder for end-of-course evaluations that result in additional training.
      A2.1.1.2. At the unit commander’s discretion, training guides for an individual
      undergoing more than one training program in a short period of time may be combined
      into one AF IMT 4022; e.g., a previous instructor in the MDS upgrading to MP may have
      his or her mission upgrade combined with instructor upgrade in the same folder.
   A2.1.2. Formal schools will send AF IMT 4022 with all training records to the trainee's
   gaining unit. Unit commanders will review formal school training records and enter
   appropriate comments on the training guide progress record or AF IMT 4023.
   A2.1.3. Units will maintain the training folders for their personnel in a location readily
   accessible to instructors and supervisory personnel. The trainee may review his or her folder
   at any time.
   A2.1.4. The instructor or trainer will review the training folder, to include AF IMT 4023 and
   4024 or the training guide, prior to all training periods. Those areas not previously
   accomplished or those, in which crewmembers require additional training, will be noted for
   possible inclusion during the current training period. Operations officers will review active
   training folders quarterly, and flight commanders or unit training representatives will conduct
   a monthly review. Monthly and quarterly reviews will be annotated on AF IMT 4023 or in
   the training guide.
   A2.1.5. Upon completion of training, place the summary/close-out report (AF IMT 4025) in
   the individual's FEF, in an inactive training folder, or as specified in local guidance. Refer to
   AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, for further guidance. Units will retain all AF IMT
   4022 contents or MAJCOM-approved training guides for 1 year, and then return them to the
   crewmember. Do not insert AF IMT 4022, 4023, or 4024 or training guides into FEFs.
   A2.1.6. If training guides are not used, AF IMT 4022, 4023, 4024, and 4025 may be used for
   ATS and formal school courses.

   A2.1.7. Units may overprint versions of AF IMT 4022, 4023, 4024, and/or 4025 in
   accordance with AFI 33-360. Unit overprints must be approved by appropriate MAJCOM
   training division.
   A2.1.8. For purposes of training documentation, classroom only training conducted at the
   unit should be identified as Academic Training (AT). GT will be considered all training
   conducted outside the classroom not associated with a flight or artificial training device.
A2.2. Instructions for AF IMT 4022. The folder is constructed of cardstock and the inside
covers are designed for documenting training. AF IMT 4023, 4024, and 4025 and additional
information (waivers, memorandums, etc.) will be centered and attached to folder fasteners.
Training guides may be placed inside the folder but are not required. Units may elect to use more
durable binders for the training guide as a substitute to the AF IMT 4022. AF IMT 4022 will be
closed upon successful completion of one of the following: flight evaluation (if required as part
of the training program), instructor validation of successful program completion (―sign-off‖) or
squadron commander certification (if required as part of the training program). NOTE: Formal

A2.5. Instructions for the AF IMT 4025, Aircrew Summary / Close-Out Report.
   A2.5.1. For each formal training program leading to qualification, to include secondary
   method training, a summary and close-out report will be completed detailing the individual's
   strengths, weaknesses, overall performance, and other pertinent information.
   A2.5.2. Unit commanders and operations officers will ensure comments on this form do not
   reflect personnel opinions or biases. All comments must be supported by information
   contained in the AF IMT 4023, 4024, or training guides as applicable. At formal schools, the
   instructor will accomplish the AF IMT 4025 and the unit commander's signature is optional.
A2.6. Aircrew Training Guides. If available, use aircrew TG for training programs.
   A2.6.1. Units may produce TG when the ATS contractor is unable to provide them. TG will
   be developed in accordance with AFI 36-2201. Coordinate TG development through
   appropriate MAJCOM with an information copy sent to HQ AFMC/ A3V. TGs may be used
   in lieu of the AF IMT 4022. TGs may be placed in the AF IMT 4022 but are not required.
   Units may elect to use a more durable binder/folder as a substitute for the AF IMT 4022.
   A2.6.2. Initiating TG. Training and resource management personnel in each unit will initiate
   a TG on crew-members prior to their entering any phase of qualification training.
   A2.6.3. Use of TG. Specific instructions for annotating training are included in each TG. TG
   will be maintained in accordance with paragraph A2.1.5
       A2.6.3.1. Active status TG will be carried by the student during all training and
       operational missions and made available to the instructor for review and annotation. The
       student will review the TG and initial the training progress record prior to the next
       training period.
       A2.6.3.2. Complete the training progress record portion of the TG in sufficient detail to
       specify areas of training accomplished, areas needing improvement, recommended
       specific study areas for the trainee, and recommended training for the next training
       period. When the trainee attains sufficient knowledge, experience, and prerequisites for
       upgrade, the instructor will recommend an evaluation and state: "Recommend evaluation
       for (crew position)" on the training progress record. Trainees will not be recommended
       for an evaluation if a TG required event is incomplete or requires corrective action.
       A2.6.3.3. On missions without an instructor or examiner, the senior qualified counterpart
       will accomplish required training for those areas not requiring an instructor. Annotate
       applicable training information in the TG.
       A2.6.3.4. When an initial qualification flight evaluation is not successfully completed
       and additional training is required, the unit commander or operations officer will annotate
       deficient areas on reproduced pages of the appropriate TG and training progress record.
       This TG insert will be placed in the AF IMT 4022 and used to document completion of
       additional training.

     associated AF IMT 4025 in an inactive training folder according to paragraph A2.1.5
     A2.6.3.6. Do not maintain the TG in the FEF.
  A2.6.4. Review Procedures.
     A2.6.4.1. Instructors and students will review the TG after each training period and
     discuss training accomplished, problem areas, and immediate goals.
     A2.6.4.2. The unit training representative will conduct a monthly review of TGs. This
     review will be indicated by entering initials and date in the review block of the TG.
     A2.6.4.3. The unit commander or operations officer will review active TG at least once
     each calendar quarter and prior to an evaluation. This review will be a separate entry on
     the TG and will include comments on weak areas and upgrade potential. Indicate review
     by signing the instructor-trainer block of the training progress record, and enter "quarterly
     review" in the training period identifier block.
     A2.6.4.4. Records of crewmembers not receiving training (but in an active status) will be
     reviewed monthly and quarterly as indicated above. If applicable, the statement, "no
     training accomplished during this period," the reason why, and the projected date when
     training will resume will be entered on the student's training progress record.
  A2.6.5. Disposition of TG.
     A2.6.5.1. Place completed TG in an inactive training folder or AF IMT 4022 and
     maintain according to paragraph A2.1.5
