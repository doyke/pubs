                                             Chapter 1

                                           OVERVIEW

1.1. Population Health (PH).
     1.1.1. PH is defined as ―the health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the
     distribution of such outcomes within the group‖ with aims to improve the health of an entire
     population.
     1.1.2. PH seeks to step beyond the individual-level focus of mainstream medicine and public
     health by focusing on the assessment and understanding of a broad range of factors that
     impact health at a population-level including social/physical environment, culture, health
     literacy, social support networks, life skills, and healthcare resource distribution.
1.2. Population Health Management (PHM).
     1.2.1. PHM refers to a combination of approaches developed and/or employed on a
     population to effectively foster health, improve quality of care and manage resources.
     1.2.2. The primary goal of PHM is to enhance the health and well-being of the population
     and, by extension, the individual members of that population.
     1.2.3. PHM strategies integrate self-care, patient education, community-based prevention
     and wellness activities, and medical intervention to reduce morbidity, decrease premature
     mortality, and improve health through primary, secondary and tertiary prevention efforts.
     1.2.4. The objective of PHM is to achieve measurable improvements in the health of a
     specified population over time.
        1.2.4.1. The PHM model (Figure 1) graphically conceptualizes the health continuum of a
        population.
        1.2.4.2. This health-centered model focuses on intervening earlier in the health/disease
        continuum to decrease morbidity and mortality and to improve quality of life. Optimal
        health is the goal of PHM.
     1.2.5. PHM activities address three of the AFMS’s greatest challenges:
        1.2.5.1. Ensuring a healthy, fit and ready force
        1.2.5.2. Improving the health of specified populations
        1.2.5.3. Managing effective and efficient health delivery systems in support of the
        Patient Centered Medical Home Model.
     1.2.6. This Instruction offers an integrated approach to help meet these challenges by
     effectively implementing and sustaining PHM in day-to-day MTF operations.
