                                            Chapter 1

                POPULATION HEALTH AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT

1.1. Population Health (PopH).
     1.1.1. PopH encompasses the analysis of health outcomes and health determinants in an
     entire population that drive strategies, policies, and interventions to optimize health.
     1.1.2. PopH steps beyond the individual-level focus of mainstream medicine by focusing on
     the assessment and understanding of a broad range of factors (health determinants) that
     impact health at a population level. These factors include (but are not limited to) individual
     behavior, social/physical environment, culture, health literacy, social support networks,
     resiliency, genetics, lifestyle, and healthcare resource distribution.
     1.1.3. The PopH model (Figure 1) depicts the broad scope of PopH and population health
     management (PHM) across the health continuum encompassing primary, secondary, and
     tertiary prevention to improve health and performance outcomes.
     1.1.4. PHM develops, fosters, and has oversight of strategies, policies and interventions
     being executed both centrally and locally at the MTF. These efforts positively impact health
     determinants, shift the health status of the population towards wellness, and improve human
     performance. This includes, but is not limited to, patient self-care, patient education, care
     coordination, community-based prevention and wellness activities that decrease premature
     mortality, reduce morbidity, improve health, and optimize wellness. In the AFMS the term
     “health care integration” is often used interchangeably with PHM.

AFI44-173 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                      5


1.2. Medical Management (MM).
   1.2.1. MM refers to the planning, coordination, and delivery of appropriate health care
   services rendered to the ill, injured, or disabled patients and/or their families. MM is multi-
   faceted and is integrated under the tenets of PopH (Figure 1.2) because of shared goals and
   objectives. The MM program is delineated within this AFI as a separate entity from PopH in
   order to clarify roles and responsibilities.
   1.2.2. MM addresses the needs of chronically ill and at-risk patients to improve patient
   outcomes and to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare delivery system.
   This is accomplished through support of PopH, Health Promotion (HP), and Patient-Centered
   Medical Home (PCMH) activities and includes coordination of efforts to improve health care
   access and quality of care while simultaneously decreasing cost and variation in care
   management.
   1.2.3. MM is comprised of Disease Management (DM), Utilization Management (UM), and
   Case Management (CM) which includes the CM function of Discharge Planning (DP). Note:
   The Wounded, Ill, and Injured (WII) program further delineates case managers into Medical
   Care Case Managers (MCCM) and Non-Medical Care Managers (NMCM). (T-0).
   1.2.4. Figure 1.2 illustrates the broad scope of PopH and MM across the health care delivery
   system. PopH improvement efforts rely on integration and collaboration among care
   delivery components and community resources. These synergies lead to improved health and
   performance outcomes within the population.

Terms
Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA)—Electronic medical
health record used for documentation of outpatient care.
Care Coordination—Care coordination uses a broader social service model that considers a
patient’s psychosocial context (e.g., housing needs, income, and social supports). It is a process
used to assist individuals in gaining access to medical, social, educational, and other services
from different organizations and providers and coordinate the continuum of care for those
beneficiaries whose needs exceed routine discharge planning but who do not meet requirements
for long term CM.
Case Management—Collaborative process of assessment, planning, facilitation, care
coordination, evaluation, and advocacy for options and services to meet an individual’s and
family’s comprehensive health needs through communication and available resources to promote
quality cost- effective outcomes. (CMSA, 2002)
Essentris—MHS inpatient electronic documentation system.
Exceptional Family Member Program—Works with other civilian and military agencies to
provide comprehensive and coordinated medical, educational, housing, community support, and
personnel services to families with special needs. EFMP ensures sponsors are assigned to those
areas where the specialized medical and educational needs of the family member can be met.
MCG Care Guidelines—Guidelines that set standardized criteria used in MM programs, such
as UM and DP. The Guidelines are used in conjunction with the healthcare professional’s
clinical judgment and define the assessment and treatment modalities that should occur at the
primary care level prior to referral for specialty care.
Population Health Working Group—A multidisciplinary group that identifies and develops
population health priorities and programs. The PHWG monitors and evaluates population health
status, processes, and outcomes to improve beneficiary health and the efficiency and
effectiveness of the healthcare delivery system.
Primary Care Manager—A healthcare provider who oversees and coordinates the general
preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic care for a particular patient.

THE ADJUSTED CLINICAL GROUP (ACG) RESOURCE UTILIZATION BAND (RUB)
                             SYSTEM

A2.1. The Adjusted Clinical Group (ACG) Resource Utilization Band (RUB) system is an
established, systematic approach for identifying high-risk or complex patients that was adopted
by the AFMS. All AF MTFs will utilize the ACG RUB system in the assessment incoming
patients for the appropriate level of care, to proactively balance provider panels, and to identify
high-risk or high-acuity candidates for targeted PHM interventions.
   A2.1.1. ACG Definition: A series of mutually exclusive health status categories defined by
   morbidity, age, and sex. They are based on the premise that the level of resources necessary
   for delivering appropriate healthcare to a population is correlated with the illness burden of
   that population. Over time, each person develops numerous conditions. Based on the pattern
   of these morbidities, the ACG approach assigns each individual to a single ACG category.
   Thus, an ACG captures the specific clustering of morbidities experienced by a person over a
   given period of time, such as a year. Individuals assigned to the same ACG category are
   expected to require similar levels of healthcare.
   A2.1.2. RUB definition: RUBs are classes into which ACG groups are broken down based
   on the patient’s age, gender, morbidity and resource utilization over a 12-month period. The
   six classes are:
       0    No or Only Invalid Dx            3    Moderate
       1    Healthy Users                    4    High
       2    Low                              5    Very High
   A2.1.3. ACG Goal: To allow healthcare providers, health plans, and public sector agencies
   to describe a population’s past healthcare utilization and costs to predict future needs. It
   provides a standardized system to allow Health Care Integrators, Disease Managers, Case
   Managers, Utilization Managers, Group Practice Managers, and providers to more effectively
   identify and manage high-risk patients.
   A2.1.4. Prerequisites: Individuals assigned to review the current ACG RUB for their
   empanelment must have a CarePoint/ MHSPHP account and complete the training for
   patient-level data access. Training information is available in the announcements section of
   the MHSPHP.
A2.2. Recommended ACG RUB for MTF providers – This is an example of how the ACG
RUBs can be divided among providers based on skill level:
   A2.2.1. ACG RUB 1-3: May be assigned to any level provider in primary care clinics.
   A2.2.2. ACG RUB 4: X percentage may be assigned to Nurse Practitioners (NP) or
   Physician Assistants (PA) as determined by the Medical Director based on such factors as
   overall provider experience, credentials, and clinical expertise.
   A2.2.3. ACG RUB 5: Requires Medical Director review before assigning to NPs or PAs.
   Review will be documented in Population Health Working Group minutes and forwarded to
   Executive Committee of the Medical Staff (ECOMS). Clinical review, conducted semi-
AFI44-173 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                 33


   annually, should be documented and maintained in provider activity folder. Clinical review
   for new providers will be accomplished after one year.
    EXAMPLE: Chart of sample RUB percentages for different level providers and clinics.
  Provider Type       % RUB % RUB 1 % RUB 2 % RUB 3 % RUB 4 % RUB 5
                           0
Internal Medicine        1-3%        1-5%      1-10%       40-60%        20-30%        15-20%
Family Medicine 5-10%               5-20%     10-20%       30-60%         5-15%         1-5%

    Note: * There will be higher numbers of RUB 0 in Pediatrics as data must be collected
    consecutively for 11 months before an ACG RUB will be generated.
A2.3. ACG Utilization Process for AF MTFs:
   A2.3.1. PCM Team Current Empanelment
       A2.3.1.1. In CarePoint/MHSPHP select the Patient Management tab from the menu.
       Then select the Other Lists from the drop down menu to the left. Select all enrollees-
       ACG.
       A2.3.1.2. Filter by provider name, make individual lists for each provider, and then
       export to Excel.
       A2.3.1.3. Result: List of each provider and their current empanelment sorted by ACG
       RUB (Very High [5] to No or Only Invalid Dx [0]).
       A2.3.1.4. SGH will develop an MTF guideline/policy on the case mix
       (number/percentage of empanelled patients each provider may have in each ACG RUB
       score) that can be assigned to each provider.
   A2.3.2. Empanelment of incoming patients new to military healthcare (newborn, new
   spouse, and new recruit/cadet/accession)
       A2.3.2.1. The HCI or other RN identifies risk level of incoming patients.
          A2.3.2.1.1. Gathers baseline data using current MTF-specific screening form at Right
          Start (MTF in-processing orientation) and highlights patients with acute or chronic
          care needs
          A2.3.2.1.2. Makes recommendation to MTF designee for PCM empanelment (most
          often Managed Care Support Contractor [MCSC]) regarding level of provider care
          needed according to conditions noted.
          A2.3.2.1.3. MTF designee for PCM empanelment assigns incoming patients to PCM.

  A2.3.3. For incoming patients with documented medical history in military healthcare
  system:
     A2.3.3.1. Current state: Follows above process as designated for patients new to military
     healthcare.
     A2.3.3.2. Interim state: The HCI or other RN reviews incoming patient’s record in
     AHLTA for the ACG RUB result found on the out-processing note written by previous
     base; the HCI or other RN then recommends empanelment assignment to MTF designee
     for PCM empanelment.
     A2.3.3.3. Future/final state: The HCI or other RN reviews incoming patient’s record in
     CarePoint MHSPHP for the ACG RUB result; the HCI or other RN then recommends
     empanelment assignment to MTF designee for PCM empanelment
  A2.3.4. Maintenance of PCM Empanelment
     A2.3.4.1. MTF designee with MHSPHP access prepares quarterly Provider ACG RUB
     empanelment distribution report for review and empanelment adjustments by GPM, UM,
     and/or SGH per MTF policy as needed for turn-over of providers/beneficiaries, to
     achieve patient safety.
     A2.3.4.2. MTF designee with MHSPHP (most often Medical Management staff) access
     prepares quarterly Provider ACG RUB empanelment distribution report for review and
     empanelment adjustments by GPM, UM, or SGH per MTF policy.
