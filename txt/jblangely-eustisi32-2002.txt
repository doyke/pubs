   contract workers and visitors on a daily basis.
   1.2. Joint Base Langley-Eustis FES (633 and 733 FES independently) respectfully request
   notification by each POC within each individual wing, group, squadron, flight or tenant
   organization    allowing   individual     development/coordination of    the    support

       the same agency, or from assisting agencies, to subordinate specific positions for the
       duration of the emergency.
       2.2.3. Senior Military Representative (SMR) denotes an individual with the delegated

             (due to intoxication, head injury, etc.), then the person should be transported to

             be contacted to authorize and Security Forces will be asked to assist.
