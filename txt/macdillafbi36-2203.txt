                          RETREAT CEREMONY PROCEDURES

A3.1. The troop commander will publicize time for retreat. Shortly before the specified time
for retreat, the troops participating in the ceremony are positioned facing the flagstaff and
dressed.
A3.2. As soon as the troops are dressed, the commander commands PARADE, REST. The
commander then faces the flagstaff, assumes the position of the troops, and waits for the
specified time for retreat.
A3.3. The commander orders the communications detachment to sound retreat at the specified
time by commanding SOUND RETREAT.
A3.4. During the playing of retreat, junior members of the flag security detail assume the
position of attention and move to the flagstaff to arrange the halyards for proper lowering of the
flag. Once the halyards are arranged, the junior members of the flag security detail execute
parade rest in unison.
A3.5. After the playing of retreat, the commander faces about and commands SQUADRON
(GROUP, ETC.), ATTENTION.
A3.6. The commander then commands PRESENT, ARMS. As soon as the troops execute
present arms, the commander faces to the front and also assumes present arms. The members of
the flag security detail not engaged with lowering the flag execute present arms at the first note
of the music.
A3.7. The communications detachment plays the national anthem or To the Colors. The
junior members of the flag security detail lower the flag slowly and with dignity.
A3.8. The commander executes order arms when the last note of the music is played and the flag
has been securely gripped. The commander faces about, gives the troops ORDER, ARMS, and
then faces to the front.
A3.9. The flag security detail folds the flag. The flag detail NCO remains at attention while
the flag is being folded unless he or she is needed to control the flag.
A3.10. When the flag is folded, the flag security detail, with the flag detail NCO on the right and
the flag bearer in the center, marches to a position three paces from the commander. The flag
detail NCO salutes and reports SIR (MA’AM), THE FLAG IS SECURED. The commander
returns the salute, and the flag security detail marches away.
A3.11. Once the flag detail has marched off, the commander faces the troops and commands
DISMISSED.

                               EVENTS AT THE FLAGSTAFF

A4.1. When practical, the persons lowering the flag should be an NCO and three Airmen for the
all-purpose flag. Coordinate with Security Forces prior to the detail to pick up the “crank shaft”
to raise & lower the flag. The detail is formed and marched to the flagstaff, and the halyards are
detached and attended from the leeward side. On the first note of the national anthem, the
members of the detail not lowering the flag execute present arms. The lowering of the flag is
coordinated with the playing of the music so the two are completed at the same time. The senior
member commands the detail ORDER, ARMS when the flag is low enough to be received. If at
half-staff, the flag is hoisted briskly to the staff head while retreat is sounded, and then it is
lowered on the first note of the national anthem or To the Colors.
A4.2. The flag is detached from the halyards and folded. The halyards are secured to the
staff.
