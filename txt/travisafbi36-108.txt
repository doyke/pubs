This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directives (AFPD) 36-25, Military Promotions and Demo-
tion, AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion Program and MPFM 01-07, Senior Airman Below the Zone (BTZ)
Program. It establishes procedures and responsibilities for the Wing Below-the-Zone (BTZ) Central Base
Board (CBB) and large units. Contains the selection of board members, identification and selection of
BTZ selectees, and eligibility requirements of nominees. It also establishes scoring guidelines and notifi-
cation procedures. This document applies to all active duty Air Force personnel assigned or attached to
Travis AFB.


1. Below–the-Zone (BTZ) Definition.
   1.1. The purpose for BTZ promotion is to provide an opportunity for exceptional Airmen First Class
   (A1C) a one-time consideration for early promotion to Senior Airman (SrA). Airmen selected for SrA
   BTZ should be those who have clearly demonstrated the potential for advancement and increased
   responsibility and are ready to move on to the next higher grade. Airmen to be considered are as fol-
   lows :
       1.1.1. A1Cs must meet the requirements in AFI 36-2502, Table 2.1, and have 36 months
       time-in-service (TIS) and 20 months time-in-grade (TIG), or 28 months TIG, whichever occurs
       first. Their commander must also recommend them.
       1.1.2. Airmen who were eligible for the previous CBB, but was not considered due to an error and
       has HQ AFPC/DPPPWM approval, will meet this board as a supplemental.

3. Responsibilities.
    3.1. 60 MSS/DPMPE will:
       3.1.1. Identify Eligibles. Personnel Systems Management provides an automatic quarterly end of
       month (EOM) output product to the MPF Career Enhancement element within the first 10 days of
       the first processing month (i.e., Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct). The roster identifies all A1Cs who meet or
       exceed the time-in-service (TIS) and time-in-grade (TIG) requirements, regardless of promotion
       ineligibility conditions (i.e., on the control roster, PAFSC skill level too low, undergoing Article
       15 suspended reduction, etc.). The output product produces an MPF alphabetical listing and a
       three-part unit listing .
           3.1.1.1. Part I. Identifies A1Cs with no quality indicators in their record.
           3.1.1.2. Part II. Lists “questionable eligibles” (individuals with quality indicators) who may
           not be qualified for BTZ promotion .
           3.1.1.3. Part III. Lists A1Cs who meet the TIG and TIS requirements, but who cannot be
           selected due to promotion ineligibility conditions listed in AFI 36-2502, table 1.1.
       3.1.2. Establish Quota. Quotas are based on 15 percent of the eligibles (based on TIG and TIS
       ONLY). MPF determines quotas before distribution to units. Large units (seven or more eligibles)
       receive quotas and promote at unit level. Small units (six or less eligibles) are combined into one
       pool of eligibles to form the CBB population. Quotas are distributed as follows:

Table 2. Quotas.
Eligibles                Quota                Eligibles               Quota
7-9                      1                    37 - 43                 6
10 - 16                  2                    44 - 49                 7
17 - 23                  3                    50 - 56                 8
24 - 29                  4                    57 - 63                 9
30 - 36                  5                    64 - 69                 10
       3.1.3. Notify Units. Units are notified if they are either a large or small unit as soon as possible,
       but no later than the third week of the first processing month. A sample notification letter to
       accompany SrA BTZ eligibility listing is provided at Attachment 2.
       3.1.4. BTZ eligibility of A1Cs PCSing. Determine the quarter the individual is BTZ eligible and
       ensure a BTZ selection folder is prepared prior to PCS departure date. This requires the MPF
TRAVISAFBI36-108 1 MAY 2003                                                                                   3


       Career Enhancements Element to coordinate on AF Form 907, Relocation Preparation Check-
       list for all A1C’s PCSing. When a selection folder is not prepared prior to an individual’s PCS
       departure date, the MPF must make every effort to obtain copies of the individuals EPRs and dec-
       oration citations by contacting the gaining MPF, or the individual at their leave address.
       3.1.5. Schedule the CBB, collect nomination packages, notify board members, provide a recorder,
       and prepare the selection folders. Board members must be notified in writing of the selection to
       serve. Squadron commanders or designated representatives assume this responsibility in the large
       units .
   3.2. Units will:
       3.2.1. Verify Eligibility. Using the MPF listing, verify the eligibility of each individual to ensure
       they meet the TIG and TIS requirements for the current quarter. Only verify the TIG and TIS
       requirements and do not consider normal promotion ineligibility conditions. This will ensure that
       only those meeting the TIG and TIS requirements are considered and possibly prevent someone
       from being considered more than once for a SrA BTZ promotion. Remove those names exceeding
       or not meeting current quarter TIG and TIS requirements and determine if a previous quarter
       board in fact considered them. Do this by reviewing that quarter’s roster if serviced by the current
       MPF, or contact the previous MPF. For individuals not considered during the quarter in which they
       met TIG and TIS eligibility, and are recommended by the commander, request supplemental BTZ
       consideration (refer to paragraph 7.). NOTE: A member must have an EPR on file before being
       considered for BTZ. If a member does not have an EPR on file contact 60 MSS/DPMPE.
       3.2.2. Consider all individuals meeting TIG and TIS requirements, even if they are TDY, on leave,
       or have a report not later than date (RNLTD) on or after the first day of the first processing month
       (i.e., Jan Apr, Jul, and Oct) for that quarter’s selections. All individuals appearing on the eligibility
       listing must be considered. The commander must review the airman’s EPR(s), their personnel
       record, PIF, discuss the consideration with the supervisor and chain of command, etc., before mak-
       ing a BTZ decision, to include whether the airman will meet a unit or base selection process. An
       EPR is required for all members being considered for BTZ, if an EPR is not available, an EPR will
       be Directed by HAF to be completed in time of the board. As stated earlier, names appearing on
       Part III of the eligiblity rosters are “considered” for promotion, but cannot be selected since they
       are ineligible for promotion according to AFI 36-2502, Table 1.1.
       3.2.3. Provide each eligible individual on Part I and II of the unit listing a record review listing
       (RRL) to verify data accuracy. Instruct individuals they must correct any erroneous data prior to
       the board convening. On Part III of the unit listing, only provide a RRL to those individuals that
       were erroneously identified as ineligible .
       3.2.4. Alternates are selected based on their board score in the event a selectee is removed before
       the effective date. Ensure the commander wishes to remove the stripe completely versus withhold.
       If the first alternate selectee’s DOR is past due, they will receive the original BTZ DOR and effec-
       tive date of unit commander approval. The MPF will assist the airman in applying for a retroactive
       promotion effective date to HQ AFPC/DPPPWM according to AFI 36-2502, paragraph 1.12.

4. Selection Procedures. Ensures the SrA BTZ program is fair, equitable, and provides timely promo-
tion consideration. NOTE: The CBB or commander is not required to use all of the quotas if they feel
early promotion is not warranted.
4                                                                    TRAVISAFBI36-108 1 MAY 2003


    4.1. Large Unit Selection Procedures. Large unit selection procedures will mirror the CBB selection
    procedures (see paragraph 5.). Once selections are made, large unit commanders underline the
    selectee(s) name, date, sign and return the BTZ eligibility listing to the MPF along with the minutes
    and score sheets, no later than the last duty day of the selection month (i.e., Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec). A
    commander may request to send individuals to the CBB, rather than conducting a squadron board
    upon wing commander approval.
    4.2. Small Unit Selection Procedures. The unit commander will determine the method for selection of
    his eligible(s) for the CBB (see note below). The commander must review the airman’s EPR(s), their
    personnel record, PIF, discuss consideration with the supervisor and chain of command, etc., before
    making a BTZ decision. It is recommended that the commander utilize the board process to ensure a
    fair selection. If a board is convened, utilize the CBB selection procedures. NOTE: Commanders must
    remember that airmen selected for early promotion to SrA should be those who have clearly demon-
    strated the potential for advancement and increased responsibility of the next higher grade. There is no
    requirement to fill your quota just for your unit to be represented.
       4.2.1. In addition to the member’s EPR, small units have the option to provide 60 MSS/DPMPE
       with an AF Form 1206 narrative (Attachment 2) by the date specified on the BTZ Transmittal
       Memorandum. The information provided on the AF Form 1206, Nomination for Award, Must
       Not duplicate information already provided in the member’s EPR(s). This is to provide additional
       information that may have occurred after the member’s EPR(s) close-out date or information that
       could not fit in the member’s EPR(s).

5. Central Base Board Processes. The board will consist of the Wing Command Chief Master Sergeant
(or designated representative) as president, and the Superintendent (or designee) from each group (615
AMOG Superintendent and a CMSgt/SMSgt from 60 AMW/DS as necessary). A nonvoting recorder will
be appointed in the grade of E-4 or higher. This recorder will assist the board by insuring records are pro-
vided, compiling minutes of the board, tabulating results of the board, and insuring the board complies
with directives. All members must act in the best interest of the Air Force and not for any particular group
or squadron to determine those airmen that have demonstrated the best potential for early advancement to
SrA.
    5.1. Board Processing. Board members will receive the nomination packages NLT the Friday prior to
    the board convening. This gives each member enough time to examine the packages and determine
    their order-of-merit.
       5.1.1. An officer will swear in the president. After the president is sworn in, he/she will administer
       the oath to the appropriate board members and the recorder.
           5.1.1.1. President and Board Members Oath. “I SOLEMENLY SWEAR THAT I WILL PER-
           FORM THE DUTIES IMPOSED UPON ME WITHOUT PREJUDICE OR PARTIALITY,
           HAVING IN VIEW BOTH THE SPECIAL FITNESS OF THE AIRMEN AND EFFI-
           CIENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE.”
           5.1.1.2. Recorder’s Oath. “I SOLEMNLY SWEAR THAT I WILL KEEP A TRUE RECORD
           OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THIS BOARD.”
       5.1.2. The board will spend the majority of their time examining the member’s leadership accom-
       plishments and job performance that contribute significantly to increase mission effectiveness.
       They will also ascertain if the scope and level of responsibilities and the impact of the mission and
TRAVISAFBI36-108 1 MAY 2003                                                                             5


     unit is the quality of someone deserving higher rank. Also, they will determine the individual’s
     ranking among their own peers and awards received, such as quarterly and annual awards (Base
     Level or Higher).
         5.1.2.1. In addition to job performance, board members may determine if the member has
         shown improvement in skills related to primary duties, such as formal training, Career Devel-
         opment Course enrollment or completion, On-the-Job training, certifications, or off-duty edu-
         cation related to primary duties. Also, determine if the member’s training or activities, to
         include any off-duty education, have significantly enhanced the member’s value as a military
         citizen. NOTE: All A1C’s may not have that same opportunity to complete off-duty education
         or be heavily involved in community relations, so take into consideration AFSC training
         requirements, work schedules, and deployment rates when assessing education levels .
     5.1.3. Board report should contain a list of board members, order of merit (identifying total score
     and select/nonselect status), and cutoff score. The board president and all voting members will
     sign the report and obtain approval by the wing commander.
     5.1.4. If an individual should have been considered during the current quarter board and the error
     is discovered before promotions are announced, large unit commanders may consider the airman
     and adjust selection accordingly (this does not apply to airmen who are gained and it has been
     determined they were not considered by their losing base--see supplemental BTZ consideration
     paragraph 7.). The CBB will reconvene to consider small unit eligibles and selections will then be
     adjusted accordingly. If discovered after selections are announced, supplemental promotion con-
     sideration procedures apply. Adjustments will not be made to the gaining unit/base quota, if the
     error is discovered for an individual that should have been considered by their losing base. Every
     effort should be made to ensure the individual is considered by their losing unit/base. If the losing
     unit/base has already announced selection, the gaining base (if commander recommends) will
     request supplemental consideration.
  5.2. Selection Folders. The selection folder will consist of copies of the members’ EPR(s), the AF
  Form 1206 in an approved format (Attachment 2) if applicable, a BTZ RIP, and decoration citation(s)
  if applicable. Units will submit nominations to 60 MSS/DPMPE in one copy. Destroy or give selec-
  tion folders to the individual when no longer needed.
  5.3. Scoring. Each nominee’s leadership qualities, articulate and positive representation of the Air
  Force, and other accomplishments are evaluated based on the facts contained in the EPR(s), AF Form
  1206, and decoration citation(s) compared with other eligibles.
     5.3.1. Board members will use a numerical scoring system to help determine their order-of-merit
     for the eligible airmen (Attachment 5) prior to the board convening. The two categories to be
     scored are Job Performance/Leadership and Education and Base/Community Involvement. Once
     the board convenes, each voting member will provide their order-of-merit to the board recorder.
6                                                                    TRAVISAFBI36-108 1 MAY 2003



Score           Evaluation
10             Definitely Promote Early
9.0 - 9.5      Probably Promote Early
8.0 - 8.5      Maybe Promote Early
7.0 - 7.5      Probably Not Promote Early
6.0 - 6.5      Definitely Not Promote Early

            5.3.1.1. Job Performance/Leadership accounts for 85 out of 100 points. Examine the airman’s
            leadership accomplishments and job performance that contribute significantly to increase mis-
            sion effectiveness. Ascertain if the scope and level of responsibilities and the impact of the
            mission and unit is the quality of someone deserving higher rank. Also, determine the individ-
            ual’s ranking among their own peers and awards received, such as quarterly and annual awards
            (Base Level or Higher).
            5.3.1.2. Education and Base/Community Involvement accounts for 15 out of 100 points.
            Determine if the airman has shown improvement in skills related to primary duties, such as
            formal training, Career Development Course enrollment or completion, On-the-Job training,
            certifications, or off-duty education related to primary duties. Also, determine if the member’s
            training or activities, to include any off-duty education, have significantly enhanced the mem-
            ber’s value as a military citizen.
       5.3.2. The recorder computes the total score of each eligible by adding the ranking numbers of all
       the voting members (i.e., someone ranked by the board members as #1, #2, #1, #4, #2, #1 will
       receive a total score of 11). After computing the total scores they will determine an order-of-merit
       by ranking the lowest score first and the highest score last on the “CBB Initial Tally Score Sheet/
       Splits” (Attachment 6). The total score will be given to the board president when all records have
       been scored.
       5.3.3. Significant Disagreements or “Split”. Splits occur when rankings are separated by five or
       more (i.e., one voting member ranks an individual as their #3 and another voting member ranks
       the same individual as their #8). If this occurs, the following procedures will be implemented :
            5.3.3.1. The president will lead an open discussion until the board members resolve the split.
            Only those individuals involved with the split may change their order-of-merit.
            5.3.3.2. If the board member(s) cannot resolve the disagreement, then the president will pro-
            vide detailed information with the board report summarizing why the board members could
            not resolve the split.
       5.3.4. Establishing the final “Cut Line”. Following resolution of "split" scores, the recorder
       will deliver to the panel chief an order-of-merit list (Attachment 7) based on the total of the indi-
       vidual scores given by each scoring board member. The recorder will then indicate which airmen
       have been selected for possible early promotion.
            5.3.4.1. If the preliminary "cut line" falls between two or more airmen with the same score
            (called the "gray zone"), the records of all airmen in the "gray zone" will be rescored by the
            board until the "cut line" falls between airmen having different scores. The recorder estab-
TRAVISAFBI36-108 1 MAY 2003                                                                            7


          lishes a final "cut line" after the board resolves the "gray zone." The board recommends air-
          men above the "cut line" to 60 AMW/CC for early promotion to SrA. The board authenticates
          this list of airmen for the record, which becomes part of the final board report.
              5.3.4.1.1. Any airman meeting the board as a supplemental and falls above the “cut line”
              will not be counted against the quota, they will be an addition to the quota. NOTE: Air-
              men meeting the board as a supplemental will not be identified to voting members
              until after the cut line has been established.

6. Selection Announcement.
   6.1. Large Units. The squadron commander will announce selectees only after the wing commander
   has approved the selections from the CBB. Non-selectees will be notified in writing.
   6.2. Small Units. After the wing commander has approved the selections from the CBB, the squad-
   ron commander will announce their selectees and non-selectees at the earliest possible time, but prior
   to the promotion effective date. The wing commander or designated representative will notify CBB
   non-selectees of their non-selection in writing .

7. Supplemental BTZ Consideration.
   7.1. Commanders may request supplemental BTZ consideration for individuals that should have been
   considered by a previous board and the error wasn’t discovered until after promotions are announced.
   After obtaining the unit commander’s recommendation, the MPF will forward the supplemental
   request to HQ AFPC/DPPWM for consideration. Supplemental consideration will not be given for
   incorrect data reflected on the BTZ RIP or for individuals who are denied BTZ nomination due to
   incorrect data reflected on the BTZ output products. It is the individual’s, supervisor’s and com-
   mander’s responsibility to ensure an individual has been properly identified as eligible, and most
   importantly, ensure the data on the BTZ RIP is accurate and complete.

                      SAMPLE SRA BTZ TRANSMITTAL MEMORANDUM



MEMORANDUM FOR (UNIT/CC)


FROM: 60 MSS/DPMPE


SUBJECT: Senior Airman (SrA) Below-the-Zone (BTZ - Quarter________________)


The attached list identifies A1C’s assigned to your organization who are eligible for SrA BTZ this
quarter. They have a date of rank (DOR) within six months of their normal fully qualified phase point
for promotion. The following instructions apply, as indicated:


____ 1. Your unit has six or less eligibles (small unit) and may nominate to the central base board
(CBB). Board date, time, and location will be provided at a later date. Please comply with the
attached instructions, underline your nominee’s name on the attached listing, sign, date, and then
return the listing not later than ___________.


____ 2. Your unit has seven or more eligibles (large unit) and may select _____ A1C(s) for promotion
IAW the attached instructions. Please underline the name(s) of your selectee(s), sign, date the listing
and return it to our office not later than _________ to ensure timely update of personnel and pay
data.


The attached SrA BTZ Unit Eligibility Listing is in three parts. Part I identifies promotion eligible A1Cs.
Part II lists “questionable promotion eligibles” (individuals with quality indicators) who may not be
qualified for BTZ promotion. Part III lists A1Cs who meet the TIG and TIS requirements, but who
cannot be selected due to promotion ineligibility conditions listed in AFI 36-2502, Table 1.1. Directed
by HAF (DBH) Enlisted Performance Reports (EPRs) on A1Cs without an EPR on file are automatically
projected. (A1Cs appearing on Part III of the unit roster do not require DBH reports). DBH EPRs will
close-out no later than the 15th day of the first processing month (i.e., Jan, Apr, Jul, and Oct) unless the
airman does not have 60 days supervision; then the closeout date will be the day 60 days supervision is
obtained.


Carefully review quality indicators (i.e., low EPR ratings, UIFs, etc.) before making your selection. You
are not required to use the full quota or make a selection (unless directed to do so by the host wing
commander or senior Air Force officer serving in that capacity).

Before making selection(s), ensure individuals identified as “skill level waiver required” qualify for a
PAFSC skill level waiver IAW AFI 36-2502, Table 2.3. The required PAFSC skill is a 3-skill level
before promotion to SrA.


Please ensure all eligibles have been properly identified as eligible, are informed of the proper study
material, and, most importantly, their personnel data is accurate and complete. The importance of your
involvement cannot be overemphasized.
