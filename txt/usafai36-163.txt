1. Commissioning:
    1.1. Authority. Each eligible USAFA graduate is appointed a commissioned officer under the provi-
    sions of Title 10, U.S.C., Sections 533, 541, 702, 9348, and 9353.
    1.2. Responsibilities. The Commandant of Cadets (Commander, 34th Training Wing (34 TRW/CC)),
    and Cadet Personnel (HQ USAFA/DPY) jointly manage cadet commissioning and implement HQ
    USAF personnel policies and directives regarding commissioning. Specific organizational require-
    ments are these:
       1.2.1. 34 TRW disseminates all cadet commissioning policies and directives to the graduating
       class.
       1.2.2. The 10th Medical Group (10 MDG) determines each cadet's physical qualification for com-
       missioning in the Armed Services and for aircrew training by examining each second class cadet
       during the fall semester of the second class year. The 10 MDG evaluates and reports each gradu-
       ate's physical qualifications to HQ USAFA/DPY, including HQ AETC/SG certified physicals for
       Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT).
       1.2.3. The Office of the Registrar (HQ USAFA/DFR) provides verified rosters, transcripts, and
       individual cadet status (for example, turnback, late graduates) as required for processing graduate
       assignments and record maintenance.
       1.2.4. The Joint Personal Property Shipping Office, Colorado Springs (JPPSO-COS), briefs grad-
       uating cadets on transportation and shipment of household goods.
       1.2.5. Financial Management (10 ABW/FM) briefs graduating cadets on pay and entitlements.
       1.2.6. The 10th Communications Squadron (10 CS) provides data processing support for record
       and assignment processing.
       1.2.7. The Career Counseling and Assignments Branch (HQ USAFA/DPYC) notifies the Air
       Force Personnel Center (HQ AFPC), DPPAO and DPPPOC, of any cadet whose graduation date
       changes or who will not receive a commission in the US Air Force.
    1.3. Appointment in the United States Air Force:
       1.3.1. The Cadet Examinations and Records Division (HQ USAFA/DFRR), Office of the Regis-
       trar (HQ USAFA/ DFR), forwards to HQ USAFA/DPY a copy of the master roster (alphabetical
       listing of complete names--last, first, middle) of USAF Academy graduates tentatively verified for
       appointment.
       1.3.2. HQ USAFA/DPYC distributes AF Form 133, Oath of Office (Military Personnel), to the
       squadron personnel representatives. The Air Officers Commanding (AOC) ensure the Oath of
       Office is administered to graduates in their respective squadrons and is returned to HQ USAFA/
       DPYC not later than 0900 graduation day.
    1.4. Appointment in Other Services (Cross-Commissioning). Cadets apply through the service
    liaison officers who provide HQ USAFA/DPYC all required documents. HQ USAFA/DPYC pro-
    cesses AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, package through the Superintendent (HQ USAFA/CC)
    to HQ USAF/DPXFA requesting approval for commissioning in the service requested. Respective
    service liaison officers work with their service counterparts to obtain graduation assignments for those

   Air Force applicants approved for cross-commissioning. HQ USAFA/ DPYC notifies HQ USAFA/
   DFRR, 34 TRW/CC, and HQ USAFA/CC those cadets approved for cross-commissioning.
       1.4.1. Cross-commissionees, either into or out of the Air Force, are ineligible to compete in the
       Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT)/Undergraduate Navigator Training (UNT) boards.
       1.4.2. HQ USAFA/DPYC, in conjunction with HQ USAFA/DF, classifies all cross-commission-
       ees into the USAF.

2. Assigning New Graduates. Before commissioning, HQ USAFA/DPYC counsels graduates on avail-
able career fields and the minimum requirements to enter them. HQ USAFA/DPYC verifies that cadets
meet the requirements for their selected Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). Career counseling acquaints
cadets with approved career fields. Graduates who are not physically qualified for or do not elect entry
into Aircrew Training may select only career fields approved for their class. HQ USAFA/DPYC compiles
and forwards all AFSC selection information to the HQ USAFA/CC for approval.
   2.1. Responsibilities:
       2.1.1. HQ USAFA/DPYC administers the graduates' assignments and implements HQ USAF and
       AFPC instructions and directives. HQ USAFA/DPYC serves as the contact point for all personnel
       actions between USAFA, AFPC, Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Air Force Insti-
       tute of Technology (AFIT), and other major commands.
       2.1.2. HQ USAFA/DPYC disseminates assignment policies, directives, and information to the
       Cadet Wing.
   2.2. Assignment to Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT). The Academy rated board selects only
   graduates who volunteer and are physically qualified for UFT (use USAFA Form 94, Cadet Evalua-
   tion for AFSC Selection.)
       2.2.1. UFT Quotas. HQ USAFA/DPYC obtains initial quotas for UPT, UNT, and Euro-NATO
       Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) from HQ AFPC/DPPAO.
       2.2.2. UFT Class Date and Base. Board order of merit and individuals' desires determine UFT
       class date and base.
       2.2.3. ENJJPT Program. This is a highly competitive flying program. The Academy rated board
       considers only volunteers for this training.
       2.2.4. Deleted.
       2.2.5. UFT to Medical School. Selectees who volunteer and are approved for and accepted to
       medical school forfeit their UFT AFSC.
   2.3. Assignments to Nonrated Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC). Graduates who do not enter
   UFT must select a career field approved for their class. Counseling acquaints cadets with the career
   fields, career progression, physical and academic requirements, and overall Air Force needs (use
   USAFA Form 94.)
       2.3.1. Nonrated AFSC Availability. HQ AFPC/DPPAO sends HQ USAFA/DPYC an annual list-
       ing of all nonrated AFSCs each graduating class may enter.
       2.3.2. Assignment Preference. After the classification process, all non-UFT-bound graduating
       cadets indicate assignment preferences by the established suspense date. HQ USAFA/DPY ranks
4                                                                USAFAI36-163 12 JANUARY 1996


       preferences primarily based upon board order of merit but may use other factors in determining
       assignment actions. Only persons responsible for monitoring and maintaining the record system in
       the performance of official duties and the conduct of official business may use board information
       (specifically board ranking).
       2.3.3. Deleted.
    2.4. Assignment to a USAFA Casual Job. UFT/intel selectees with class start dates of October or
    later of their graduation year will perform casual duty at the USAF Academy. HQ USAFA/DPYC:
       2.4.1. Distributes a memorandum throughout the Academy requesting job descriptions.
       2.4.2. Ensures all job requests are submitted to HQ USAFA/DPYC by the suspense date.
       2.4.3. Ensures a list of jobs is made available to the Cadet Wing after the UFT base and date
       selections have been announced.
    2.5. Assignment to Other Casual Jobs. Casual status at a location other than USAFA is normally
    not available. Exceptions may be approved by the Superintendent. If approved, the TDY unit will
    normally provide a TDY fund cite.
    2.6. Assignment to Graduate Education:
       2.6.1. The Cadet Awards and Graduate Studies Office (HQ USAFA/DFSAA) manages selection
       for graduates applying for graduate education through scholarships, fellowships, the Graduate
       School Program, and the medical education program. Selections are based on merit and Air Force
       requirements.
       2.6.2. Graduates may enter scholarship and fellowship programs (as approved by the Graduate
       Scholarship Committee) as an initial assignment, provided:
           2.6.2.1. They are volunteers.
           2.6.2.2. They are academically qualified and accepted by AFIT and the academic institution
           they will be entering.
           2.6.2.3. The USAF Academy recommends them for the program.
       2.6.3. HQ USAFA/DFSAA prepares all required documents and forwards them to HQ USAFA/
       DPYC.
       2.6.4. HQ USAFA/DFRR forwards to HQ AFIT/RR and HQ AFPC a list of graduates recom-
       mended for the Honor Graduate Program (Blue Chip) (reference AFCAT 36-2223).
       2.6.5. HQ USAFA/DFSAA forwards the names of scholarship winners to HQ USAFA/DPYC for
       processing as quickly as possible upon receipt.
       2.6.6. HQ USAFA/DPYC processes and forwards to HQ AFIT acceptance applications of gradu-
       ates recommended for programs in this paragraph.

    medical school programs as an initial assignment.
       2.7.1. Upon HQ USAFA/CC final approval, the Biology Department (HQ USAFA/DFB) for-
       wards HQ USAFA/ DPYC a listing of first class cadets recommended for medical school pro-
       grams.
USAFAI36-163 12 JANUARY 1996                                                                                 5


       2.7.2. HQ USAFA/DPYC processes and forwards to HQ AFPC acceptance memorandums of
       graduates accepted to medical school. Medical school acceptance normally cannot be accom-
       plished after graduation.

3. Taking Graduation Leave. USAF Academy graduates are authorized 60 days nonchargeable gradua-
tion leave, military requirements permitting (i.e., provided it does not conflict with their reporting instruc-
tions). This leave must be taken and completed within 90 days of graduation (Title 10, U.S.C.).
Graduation leave may not be carried forward beyond the reporting date to the first permanent duty station
or to a port of embarkation for permanent duty outside the United States or in Alaska or Hawaii. Gradu-
ating cadets must provide HQ USAFA/DPYC with leave address and telephone number so that HQ
USAFA/DPYC can maintain accountability records.

4. Taking Graduation Leave Overseas. Graduates taking leave in foreign countries must contact the
main post office passport division for procedures on entering foreign countries and other requirements of
the Foreign Clearance Guide.

5. Issuing PCS Orders. HQ AFPC furnishes graduate assignment instructions to HQ USAFA/DPYC
through the Personnel Data System (PDS). HQ AFIT furnishes HQ USAFA/DPYC and HQ AFPC addi-
tional assignment instructions for those entering graduate education programs. HQ USAFA/DPYC com-
pares assignment information received with the graduates' assignment choices to ensure assignments are
generally consistent with the graduates' order of preference. HQ USAFA/DPYC complies with all assign-
ment instructions and sends PCS orders to all graduates in a timely manner.

6. Form Prescribed: USAFA Form 94.
