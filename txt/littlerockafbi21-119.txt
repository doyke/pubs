SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: Responsibility for servicing carts.
1. General. This instruction was developed to align responsibilities and ensure compliance with
applicable directives for adequate quality control of breathing oxygen for aviators and to ensure
safety of flight. Although LOX is not flammable, it does support combustion and has an
expansion ratio of 860:1. This instruction will provide units with increased flexibility and
improved control of equipment assets for daily use and during deployments.
2. Areas of Responsibility. This section establishes responsibilities of each unit. By defining
areas of responsibility, positive control of equipment will be achieved and will permit greater
control of assets for daily use and mobility requirements.
     2.1. Aircraft Maintenance Units (AMU) will:
        2.1.1. Be allocated 1 LOX carts per 4-5 aircraft per AMU. The number of LOX carts
        may vary depending upon equipment availability.
        2.1.2. Establish a control log within each maintenance unit debrief section for
        documenting the use of LOX during aircraft servicing for accountability purposes.
        Headings for the log will contain as a minimum: cart number, aircraft tail number, and
        date serviced. Control log will be maintained for a minimum of 1month.
        2.1.3. At the unit’s discretion, secure LOX/GOX carts secured by means of chains or
        locking devices to prevent unauthorized use. If locking devices are used, units will
        establish control procedures for the accountability/control of locking devices, locks, and
        keys.
        2.1.4. Be responsible for all LOX/GOX carts AFTO Form 134 documentation. If LOX
        usage is not documented on the AFTO Form 134, the user AMU supervision will be
        notified and the cart will not be serviced until the proper documentation has been
        completed. If all LOX that is missing cannot be accounted for on the AFTO Form 134,
        then the cart will be turned over to the electrical environmental back shop to ensure the
        cart is completely serviceable.
        2.1.5. Perform a serviceability inspection prior to use IAW applicable technical data for
        the LOX cart being used. Document any discrepancies on AFTO IMT 244 IAW T.O. 00-
        20-1. LOX carts should not be used below 10 gallons to prevent cart from becoming
        empty causing 2 days of downtime for draining, purging, and re-servicing.
        2.1.6. Be responsible for taking the cart to the servicing line at Cryro Plant (POL) if the
        quantity of LOX in the tank drops below 10 gallons after servicing an aircraft. When
        transporting a LOX cart with an approved GOV, do not exceed 5 mph and ensure the
        vent valve is closed during movement. Once parked, open the vent valve to continuously
        relieve pressure and leave open while parked and stowed.
        2.1.7. Coordinate use of another unit’s LOX/GOX cart between production
        superintendents.

  2.2. 19 CMS/Electrical Environmental Section will:
     2.2.1. Retain three LOX carts in ready-reserve status as temporary replacements for carts
     down for maintenance, carts being refurbished, and to help fulfill mobility requirements.
     The number of LOX carts may vary dependent upon equipment availability.
     2.2.2. Maintain two GOX carts in ready reserve. The number of GOX carts may vary
     dependent upon equipment availability.
     2.2.3. Prepare LOX carts and complete shipping documents as required for unit
     deployments and Maintenance Repair Teams (MRT). Users will perform transfer and
     acceptance inspections as required.
     2.2.4. Conduct daily inspections each morning to determine LOX cart serviceability.
     Document and maintain all AFTO IMT 244s for accountability purposes.
     2.2.5. Coordinate with 19 CMS Production Section for any support requested during off
     duty hours.
  2.3. TA Section will:
     2.3.1. Be allocated one GOX cart.
     2.3.2. Establish a control log for documenting the use of LOX during aircraft servicing
     for accountability purposes. Headings for the log should contain as a minimum: cart
     number, aircraft tail number, and date serviced. Control log will be maintained for a
     minimum of 1 month.
     2.3.3. Coordinate with MOC on the availability of a LOX cart. TA will then sign-out
     and be responsible for all AFTO Form 134 and AFTO IMT 244 cart form documentation.
     TA will deliver LOX cart to aircraft for servicing and return LOX cart to the LOX plant.
     TA will return the keys back to the appropriate AMU.
     2.3.4. Perform a serviceability inspection prior to use IAW applicable technical data for
     the LOX cart being used. Document any discrepancies on AFTO IMT 244 IAW T.O. 00-
     20-1. LOX carts should not be used below 10 gallons to prevent cart from becoming
     empty, causing 2 days of downtime for the cart to be drained, purged, and serviced.
  2.4. 19 LRS/Fuels Management Element will:
     2.4.1. Refill serviceable LOX carts positioned at the LOX facility servicing line, 0900
     hours Monday thru Friday and at 1400 on Saturday. In order to conserve LOX, POL
     must have a minimum of 2 carts with 20 gallons or less remaining before carts will be
     serviced. The respective unit will coordinate emergency servicing through MOC. Units
     will provide a fire guard (second person) for all emergency servicing outside of normal
     times list or as mission dictates with the coordination with the MOC. (IAW AFOSH 91-
     67, Para 2.8.2 (3), and AFI 23-201).
     2.4.2. Properly document the equipment forms and notify MOC of any discrepancies
     noted prior to or during servicing. Identify any AFTO Form 134 discrepancies to the
     owning unit’s production superintendent through the Maintenance Operations Center
     (MOC) or EMS/CMS production supervisor.

    2.4.3. Maintain a historical file of completed AFTO Form 134’s, IAW T.O. 42B6-1-1,
    Para 2.22.e. The AFTO Form 134 may be destroyed 2 weeks after the date of the last
    recorded servicing IAW T.O. 42B6-1-1 Para 2.22.f.
