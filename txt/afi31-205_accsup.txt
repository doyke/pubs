not apply to Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard units and members. It does not apply

Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this document are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (to be AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and are disposed of
in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://
afrims.amc.af.mil. Contact supporting records managers as required. Send comments and suggested

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This document was revised
to align it with AFI 31-205. HQ ACC/SFOP is replaced by HQ ACC/A7FS as the office of primary
responsibility. Personnel tuberculosis testing and medical records annotations (paragraph 5.3.1.) have
been deleted.
1.2.5. ACC Security Forces units will not house transient inmates under the control of civilian law
enforcement officers.
1.3.8. The ACC Physical Security Branch (HQ ACC/A7FS) is the MAJCOM focal point for corrections
activities.
2.3. Training. Unit training managers must include corrections courses as part of their annual formal
training forecast. Units may submit out-of-cycle requests as needed.

3.6.3. Level I facilities requesting deviations for safety, transfer and escort requirements must send devi-
ation requests to HQ ACC/A7FS, who will coordinate and forward to the Air Force Security Forces Cen-
ter Corrections Division (HQ AFSFC/SFC).
4.1. Establishing, Changing Designation and Closing Level 1 CFs and RCFs. Send requests to HQ
ACC/A7FS early in the planning process when establishing or changing the status of existing corrections
facilities.
4.3.1.2. Forward requests via electronic mail or written memorandum to HQ ACC/A7FS
(acc.a7fs2@langley.af.mil) when requesting authority to operate under reduced space allocation rules.
4.3.1.4. Make adjustments such as bunking beds and rearranging furniture to help meet square footage
requirements.
5.3.2.1. Only authorized personnel (e.g. IAW DoD 6025.18-R, DoD Health Information Privacy Regula-
tion) with an official need to know may review medical records. Medical personnel will notify the correc-
tions staff and coordinate medical/mental health issues.
5.10. Hospitalized Detainees/inmates. If there are no inpatient medical facilities on base, the medical
officer responsible for the inmate patient's medical care will determine what type of transport is required;
medical care enroute; and the level of medical assistance required during transport, if any. This informa-
tion will be documented in the patient's medical record.
5.10.4. (Added) Non-Hospitalized Inmates. The medical officer responsible for inmate medical matters
and the corrections officer will coordinate to develop local operating instructions addressing inmate escort
during routine, outpatient medical appointments. They should consider inmate custody grade, history of
violence, risk, and the presence of sensitive or hazardous equipment in clinical areas. The objective is to
maintain reasonable control of the inmate, ensure the safety of medical staff members and escorts, provide
adequate medical care as needed, and respect the doctor-patient relationship.
