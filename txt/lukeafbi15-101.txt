                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. The 56 OSS/OSW Weather Flight (WF) provides and/or arranges weather
support to the 56th Fighter Wing (FW) and all associate units assigned to Luke AFB, Arizona.
The WF is the focal point for all weather-related issues. This instruction establishes
requirements and procedures pertaining to weather support during peacetime operations. This
instruction will be reviewed annually and updated as required.
1.2. Background.
   1.2.1. According to the CSAF-approved Strategic Plan for AFW Reengineering (8 Aug 97),
   implemented at Luke AFB on 26 Sep 01, an Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) will
   provide resource protection, terminal aerodrome forecasts, regional, and operational-level
   weather products and information, meteorological watch (METWATCH), Pilot to Metro
   Service (PMSV), and flight weather briefing support for Air Force locations within
   designated geographic regions.
   1.2.2. Based on the guidance in the Strategic Plan, the 25 OWS at Davis-Monthan AFB,
   Arizona will provide regional and operational-level weather products and information to Air
   Force units in the Western region of the Continental United States (CONUS).
   1.2.3. Based on the guidance in the Strategic Plan, the WF at each Air Force location will
   focus on providing tactical-level weather products and information needed for mission
   execution and provide weather products and information to the commander of deployed
   forces during wartime, contingency, and exercise operations.
1.3. Responsibilities. General responsibilities of the OWSs and WFs are outlined in AFI
15-128, Aerospace Weather Operations – Roles and Responsibilities. Specific responsibilities of
the 25 OWS and the 56 OSS/OSW are defined in Memorandum of Agreement 15-22 between
the two units and in this instruction. The 25 OWS issues Luke’s Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts
(TAFs), forecasted weather warnings, watches and advisories, and provides flight weather
briefings to transient aircrews passing through Luke when required. The 56 OSS/OSW will
issue all observed advisories and warnings and create tailored products called Mission Execution
Forecasts (MEFs) focused on the local mission.
1.4. Duty Priorities.
       1.4.1. 25 OWS Duty Priorities. 25 OWS duty priorities listed in Tables 1.1. and 1.2.
       exist to match and balance limited manning and mission critical tasks. Duty priorities
       focus efforts during peak work periods prone to task saturation and priority conflicts.
       Weather operators will use good judgment in complying with these duty priorities,
       especially when there is imminent danger to life and/or property.

             National Weather Service).
    18       Accomplish Weather Functional Training and Administrative Tasks.
1.5. Contact info and Operational Hours. The 56 OSS/OSW is located on the flight line side
of building 453. Forecasters are on duty from 0001 local time Monday until 30 minutes after the
last locally landing aircraft on Friday. Weekends and holidays are staffed as required by 56 FW
flying. Weather personnel are not required for transient or community support and will only be
on-duty when 56 FW flying is scheduled. During duty hours, forecasters can be reached at DSN
896-6805/2992 and comm 623-856-6805/2992. The fax number is DSN 896-3124 and comm
623-856-3124. Flight email is 56oss.osw@luke.af.mil. During off duty hours, members can be
reached via the 56 FW Command Post.
1.6. Assumptions and Shortfalls.
   1.6.1. 25 OWS Assumptions. Adequate resources and communications will be available to
   execute the MOA and sufficient weather intelligence will be available from various sources
   on which to base weather operations and production.
   1.6.2. 56 OSS/OSW Assumptions. Weather support can only be provided if the appropriate
   facilities, funding, communications, personnel, and indigenous support (e.g., power, water,
   etc.) are available.
   1.6.3. 56 OSS/OSW Shortfalls: Some services may not always be available (e.g., flight
   weather briefings) due to WF staffing, station evacuation, or other higher priority missions
   (Table 1.3).
1.7. Alternate (Back-up) Weather Operations Site. In the event of a building evacuation,
Airfield and Mission Services will move to the Tower Simulator facility, at the base of and just
southwest of the Air Traffic Control Tower (building 955) to continue operational FW support
and ―eyes forward‖ responsibilities for the 25 OWS. The WF can be contacted at DSN 896-
3570. Access to airfield weather sensor readouts may be lost and backup equipment use will be
implemented, if required. When backup equipment is used wind speed/direction, and pressure
measurements will be estimated. 56 OSS/OSW members will follow duty specific SOPs and

Evacuation Checklists (including a list of required backup equipment) and resume services at the
alternate location as soon as possible. Most weather services and support will be able to be
provided, but will require a case-by-case assessment dependent on communication line status,
equipment status, etc. Expect most services (e.g. pilot briefings, PMSV) to be somewhat
degraded due to limited facilities and potential loss of dedicated data services, including airfield
sensors and various data types such as radar. Staff services will also move to the simulator
facility if required. For flight safety reasons, the WF will not completely evacuate for exercises.
See Chapter 7.3. for details on dissemination back-up procedures.
1.8. Release of Weather Information to Non-DoD Agencies and Individuals. Weather
information will not be released to non-DoD agencies or the general public without approval
from the 56 FW Public Affairs and Judge Advocate offices. Any questions/clarifications will be
coordinated through the WF Commander and/or Flight Chief.
1.9. Post-Mission Analysis / Feedback. Per AFMAN 15-129, Chapter 4, WFs must conduct
post-mission verification to measure accuracy/relevancy of weather services provided to parent
and host units. In order for this to be effective, units that regularly utilize weather support from
the 56 OSS/OSW are asked to provide post-mission/utilization feedback when possible. This
information will be used to ensure proper quality assurance, provide a metrics database of
forecast accuracy and gauge flight strengths and weaknesses. Formal/informal feedback
methods include:
     1.9.1. A web-based feedback email address is 56oss.osw@luke.af.mil (located on the
     weather   intranet  web    page   at   \\luke\dfs\56OG\56OSS\OSW\Working\Backup
     Web\Weather.html).
     1.9.2. PIREPs transmitted via PMSV (UHF 267.4).
     1.9.3. SOF and Operations Supervisor End of Day reports.
     1.9.4. Face-to-face feedback after any briefing.
     1.9.5. Email and/or phone calls to the Flight Commander or Flight Chief.
1.10. Mishap Procedures. The 56 OSS/OSW has a major role when the airfield is advised of
an emergency or mishap. The Air Force Weather Agency and the 25 OWS may also be
involved. In general, the WF will ensure applicable data used in the development of any weather
information, product, and/or service provided/saved for an investigation (to include MEFs,
Tactical Decision Aids, space weather products, observations, etc.) are saved. The WF will save
enough data before and after the mishap to fully reconstruct the environmental conditions. The
WF will also coordinate with the 25 OWS to initiate a data save for OWS-produced/provided
products used in preparing flight weather MEFs. If the WF used products from other OWSs to
support missions crossing AORs, they must coordinate with all applicable OWSs to initiate a
data save. Once the required information is gathered, it will be delivered to the 56 FW Flight
Safety Office for incorporation into Safety Investigation Boards.

                                         Chapter 3

                                  AIRFIELD SERVICES

3.1. General. The Airfield Services Element (ASE) is responsible for all weather support
within a 5 nautical mile (NM) radius of the runway’s center point. The ASE will interface with
the SOF, the 25 OWS, and other operational users in the 56 FW. Additionally, they will use the
MEF process to tailor weather products and provide decision-quality environmental information
for mission planning and execution for the 56 FW. Weather technicians will infuse elements of
weather observing, meteorological watch, and force protection roles to function as the "eyes
forward" for the OWS and, in many cases, will serve as the primary point of contact for the
collaborative forecast effort.
3.2. Operational Hours. Airfield services are provided in person from 0001 local time Monday
until 30 minutes after the last locally landing aircraft on Friday. Weekends and holidays are
staffed as required by 56 FW flying. Weather personnel are not required for transient or
community support and will only be on-duty when 56 FW flying is scheduled. Weather
personnel performing these services can be contacted at DSN 896-2992/6805 or via fax at DSN
896-3124.
3.3. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs). Luke AFB TAFs will be produced and
disseminated by the 25 OWS IAW AFI 15-128, AFMAN 15-124, AFMAN 15-129, and the Luke
WF-25 OWS MOA. Forecast specification and amendment criteria are listed in Attachment 2.
TAFs are valid for 24 hours, apply to the area within a 5-NM radius of the Luke AFB airfield
complex,     and      will      be     issued   at     0900Z,     1700Z,     and      0100Z.
3.3.1. TAF Specification Criteria. The Luke AFB TAF will be specified and amended in
accordance with categories listed in AFMAN 15-129 and local airfield minimums listed in flight
publication manuals. Any changes will be coordinated with the 25 OWS.
3.4. Luke MEF. By following the MEF process and utilizing flying schedules and profile/pilots
limitations outlined in chapter 2, the ASE further refines the Luke AFB TAF into a Luke AFB
MEF. The MEF is valid only from airfield open to close, is more focused on local airfield and
pilot restrictions and is updated more frequently than the traditional TAF. The Luke AFB MEF
is available for all agencies via 56 FW Intranet Web Page and for ATC agencies via the
automated dissemination system (ADS). Attachment 2 details all specification and amendment
criteria.
   3.4.1. Issue Times. MEFs are issued 3 hrs prior to first takeoff, at 1800Z and at 0200Z
   (except Friday). MEFs will not be issued on weekends, holidays, or down days when the
   airfield is closed.

3.5. Surface Weather Observations. Surface weather observations are taken, recorded, and
disseminated IAW AFMAN 15-111 by the Automatic Meteorological Station, otherwise known
as the FMQ-19. The FMQ-19 is a collection of weather sensors placed on each end of the
runway as well as a barometer located at the midpoint which measures, consolidates and formats
weather information to include winds, cloud heights/coverage, visibility, temperature, dewpoint,
pressure as well as many others. This information is then automatically disseminated as the
official airfield weather observation.
   3.5.1. Official Observing Site. During normal operations, the official observing site is the
   touchdown end of the active runway which coincides with the active visibility and ceiling
   sensors of the FMQ-19. Upon notification from ATC that a runway change has been
   completed, the WF will switch the FMQ-19 sensor suite to match the active runway. When
   backup operations become necessary, the official site will be the physical location from
   which the duty technician visually determines sky condition, present weather, and prevailing
   visibility. Luke’s backup observation site is located on the roof of building 453 (Base
   Operations), on the flight line side. In the event of an evacuation, the observation point at the
   Alternate Operating Location will be from outside of the Tower Simulator facility.
   3.5.2. Types of Weather Observations.
       3.5.2.1. Routine Meteorological Observation Report (METAR). METAR
       observations are taken and disseminated every hour between 55 and 59 minutes after the
       hour. METAR observations are disseminated both locally and long line via the ADS.
       3.5.2.2. Special Observations (SPECI). SPECI observations are taken whenever
       certain weather events, defined in AFMAN 15-111, LAFBI 13-203/AFI 11-202V3 and
       Fight Information Publications, occur at Luke AFB. These observations are disseminated
       both locally and long line via the ADS (JET). Special ceiling and visibility criteria are
       listed in Table 3.2.

   3.5.3. Augmenting Surface Observations. Guidance governing supplementing or backing
   up FMQ-19 operations is outlined in AFMAN 15-111. Luke-specific instructions are
   outlined below.
   3.5.4. Weather Sensor Limitations.
       3.5.4.1. The FMQ-19 is unable to report dust (DU) or blowing dust (BLDU) as a
       visibility restrictor.
       3.5.4.2. When very fine dust particles are detected by the FMQ-19, the closest match in
       its algorithm is light drizzle (e.g. -DZ). Consequently, the likelihood of errant
       observations being automatically transmitted is very high. Drizzle is not a significant
       limitation and will not result in augmentation/correction by the Luke WF.
       3.5.4.3. The FMQ-19 is unreliable at estimating ceiling heights near and above 10,000
       feet AGL and this can potentially impact simulated flame out (SFO) pattern operations.
       To limit risk and aid ATC and SOF, the WF will back-up the FMQ-19 and take a SPECI
       the first time a ceiling is observed below 10,000 feet AGL; additionally, the technician
       will backup hourly observations for ceiling until ceiling is observed at or above 10,000
       feet AGL again.
       3.5.4.4. The WF will also verify/crosscheck FMQ-19 AUTO output when requested by
       ATC/SOF to ensure representative conditions are reported in the official airfield
       observation.
3.6. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations,
requires the Luke WF (WF) to establish a cooperative weather watch (CWW) with base agencies
who can report changes in weather conditions to the airfield services technician (6-6805/2992).
At Luke AFB, these reliable sources include Air Traffic Control (ATC), Supervisor of Flying
(SOF), flying units and the Security Forces Squadron (SFS). This memorandum clarifies the
roles and responsibilities associated with CWW.
   3.6.1. The weather technician will reevaluate weather conditions whenever a reliable source
   (e.g. ATC, pilots or law enforcement) reports weather conditions different from the last
   disseminated observation. The change in weather conditions may be included in the next
   METAR, become the basis for a SPECI, be used to issue an observed weather advisory or
LUKEAFBI15-101 11 OCTOBER 2011                                                                15


   warning, amend the TAF through coordination with 25 OWS forecasters or to amend or
   update the Luke MEF.
   3.6.2. Reliable sources will notify the Luke WF when any of the following are seen or occur
   within 5 miles of Luke airfield and are not being reported:
       3.6.2.1. Tornado or funnel cloud is observed.
       3.6.2.2. Hail begins or ends.
       3.6.2.3. Volcanic Ash is observed.
       3.6.2.4. Thunderstorms and/or lightning are observed.
   3.6.3. Additionally, weather-certified Tower personnel will notify the Luke WF when any of
   the following are seen or occur within 5 miles of Luke airfield and are not being observed:
       3.6.3.1. Precipitation begins or ends.
       3.6.3.2. Visibility decreases to less than, or increases to equal or exceed 4 miles. When
       prevailing Tower visibility is less than 4 miles, report changes in tower prevailing
       visibility and sector visibility to the WF.
       3.6.3.3. A PIREP verifies a ceiling decrease to less than, or increases to equal or exceed
       10,000 feet.
3.7. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH). METWATCH provides an organized approach
for weather personnel to maintain situational awareness of the current/future meteorological
situation within a designated area(s). This process involves notifying supported units and
updating any forecast products when pre-established weather conditions or unforecast changes
(timing, location, or forecast values) in weather occur or are expected to occur. All on-site
meteorological and commercial data sources (Weather Satellite/Radar, Websites, Web cameras,
etc) may be used to accomplish this task. The 25 OWS will perform a continuous Terminal
METWATCH for Luke AFB. 56 OSS/OSW personnel will act as the ―eyes forward‖ for the 25
OWS by providing immediate feedback on current or short-term anticipated changes in weather
conditions. 25 OWS will also perform Flight and Route METWATCH for transient flights they
briefed that are departing from Luke AFB. The 56 OSS/OSW will perform Flight and Route
METWATCH for transient flights departing Luke AFB that were briefed by WF personnel.
   3.7.1. EYES FORWARD Process/Procedure. This process/procedure is the WF’s role in
   allowing for the integration of weather data, meteorological satellite imagery, lightning
   detection readouts, and non-standard weather data systems to create an integrated weather
   picture and near-term forecast for the OWS. We provide meaningful meteorological
   information not contained in the coded observations to the 25 OWS as an integral part of our
   METWATCH process (phone calls, emails, etc.). Additionally, we integrate the current state
   of the atmosphere into an understanding of future impacts on forecast conditions and
   communicate the impacts/information to the 25 OWS, as needed.
3.8. Pilot-to-METRO Service (PMSV) Support. Weather information is available via PMSV
during operating hours on frequency 267.4 MHz. Weather technicians will monitor PMSV
traffic during operating hours for all aircraft contacts. For aircraft outside the range of our
PMSV system, the 25 OWS can provide PMSV support through a phone patch to the 56 FW
Command Post (856-5600/5603). The SOF, RAPCON, and Air Traffic Control (ATC)

personnel will pass airborne weather information and PIREPs to the 56 OSS/OSW IAW FAAO
7110.65 within 5 minutes after receipt when possible. The 56 OSS/OSW will disseminate all
PIREPs either locally when information only impacts 56 FW aircraft, or both locally and
worldwide when operationally significant weather (moderate turbulence/icing, wind shear of any
type, cloud bases and tops, or thunderstorms of any type) are reported. PMSV calls will be
handled IAW 56 OSS/OSW Duty Priorities listed in Table 1.1.

                                     MISSION SERVICES

4.1. General. The Mission Weather Element (MWE) is responsible for all weather support to
56 FW activities beyond a 5 nautical mile (NM) radius from the runway’s center point. The
MWE will interface with SOFs, the 25 OWS, and other operational users in the 56 FW.
Additionally, they will use the MEF process to tailor weather products and provide decision-
quality environmental information for mission planning and execution for the 56 FW. Weather
personnel will fully understand their customers’ mission and tactics, along with the OWS's
capabilities, in order to better anticipate and exploit the weather.
4.2. Operational Hours. Mission services are provided in person from 0001 local time Monday
morning until 30 minutes after the last locally landing aircraft on Friday. Weather personnel
performing these services can be contacted at DSN 896-2992/6805 or via fax at DSN 896-3124.
4.3. The Luke Range MEF. By following the MEF process and utilizing flying schedules and
profile/pilots limitations outlined in chapter 2, the MWE creates MEFs for all military operating
areas, ranges, air refueling tracks and cross country trips utilized by the 56 FW. MEFs include
Night Vision Goggle and Electro-Optic targeting data, solar/lunar data, UHF/VHF/GPS impacts,
cloud bases, coverages and thickness, surface and flight level winds/temperature, altimeter
setting, visual route conditions, enroute hazards to flight as well as contrail, freezing level and
divert airfield forecasts. Examples are detailed and shown below. MEFs are available for all
agencies via 56 FW Weather Web Page and are designed to provide critical go/no-go weather
information for all phases of each sortie.

     levels 010, 015, 030 and in increments of 5,000 feet from 050 to the airspace ceiling will
     be displayed.




     4.3.1.6. Electro-Optic Forecasts. Forecasts of transmissivity, absolute humidity, lock-
     on range and laser sensor ranging range are projected every 2 hours throughout the daily
     flying window. In addition, multiple jpeg images depicting thermal crossover times for
     various targets are created.

      Extended Planning Forecast for Luke AFB as part of the morning MEF (3 hrs prior to
      takeoff). This product depicts go/no-go weather specific to local flying in ―stop-light‖
      format for the upcoming five days for the first go (AM) and second go (PM) and is for
      planning purposes only. A ―stop-light‖ legend is located on the bottom-left of the image
      and the average monthly climatology for the airfield is on the bottom-right. Planners can
      view this product via the following link:

       4.3.1.11. MISSIONWATCH. MISSIONWATCH is the term used to describe the
       process by which the WF monitors the weather for all local missions, to include all
       training areas. All on-site meteorological and commercial data sources may be used to
       accomplish this task and is the primary responsibility of the mission weather technician.
       4.3.1.12. MEF Amendments. When weather conditions change, and when these
       conditions cross known mission limiting criteria (ref: section 2.4) the WF will amend its
       forecast. Amending the MEFs for the many training areas and numerous profiles is a
       significant challenge. During rapidly changing weather, the WF will amend the MEF as
       required and contact the SOF, Flying Squadrons and/or the 56 FW Command Post to pass
       on critical changes.
       4.3.1.13. Top-3 Briefings. The mouthpiece of the MWE is the individual providing
       Top-3 briefings. Prior to the first takeoff of each ―go‖, and depending on manning levels
       and weather conditions, a face-to-face brief will be conducted for the duty Top 3 of each
       flying squadron. If conditions are tranquil and no changes are expected, the brief prior to
       the second ―go‖ may be conducted via phone. In the event of rapidly changing
       conditions, a re-brief will be conducted when necessary.
       4.3.1.14. Follow-Up Support. Pilots are encouraged to pass immediate feedback to the
       WF (x2992/6805) for any post-mission information and/or follow-up support in
       accordance with section 1.9 above.
4.4. Traditional Flight Weather Briefings. Weather personnel will provide verbal or
traditional Flight Weather Briefings (DD Form 175-1) to aircrews as requested following the
flight’s duty priorities. Briefings will be either at the WF, building 453, or via fax or phone.
Please provide weather personnel as much lead-time as possible to complete the request by
calling x2992/6805 or faxing request to x3124.
LUKEAFBI15-101 11 OCTOBER 2011                                                            23


  4.4.1. Mass Briefings. Out-of-station mass briefings for special missions (i.e. Frag Drop,
  Large Force Employment, Deployment Briefings) provide a unique scheduling problem.
  Please coordinate these briefs with the WF x6-6837/6805 as early in the mission planning
  process as possible.
  4.4.2. Off-Station 56 FW Aircraft. Off-station 56 FW aircraft should call the WF for
  briefing updates or anytime flight weather support is needed.
  4.4.3. Transient Aircrews. Transient aircrews can receive flight weather briefings via the
  WF during duty hours or via the 25 OWS briefing cell via the steps outlined on the Airfield
  Ops briefing terminal located in the flight planning room next to Airfield Management (Bldg
  453).

                                STAFF WEATHER SERVICES

5.1. General. The WF Commander and Flight Chief will perform both operational and staff
weather functions. In addition to leadership and management of flight activities, these members
will function as a direct interface with the host or parent unit's commander and staff, and provide
direct support to command, control, and planning functions.
5.2. Operational Hours. Unless there is an emergency, coordination with the WF staff should
happen during normal duty hours (0730L-1630L).
5.3. Staff Weather Briefings.
   5.3.1. Standup Briefings. The WF has the ability to conduct a Commander’s Staff brief and
   has done so in the past. Please contact the WF staff to arrange this support.
   5.3.2. IRC Briefings. The WF provides IRC briefings as required by course scheduling in
   accordance with AFMAN 11-210 and AFMAN 15-129. The weather portion of the briefing
   consists of an overview of the WFs airfield and mission services, weather capabilities, WF
   and OWS responsibilities, resource protection and seasonal/regional weather
   impacts/outlooks.
   5.3.3. SOF Briefings. Flight leadership will present upcoming seasonal weather challenges
   at quarterly SOF briefings. This will also be the venue to address SOF weather support
   issues.
   5.3.4. Climatology Briefings. Climatology information will be provided as requested.
   5.3.5. Deployment Briefs. The Luke WF has traditionally supported two types of
   deployments.
       5.3.5.1. Flying Squadron Deployment. Prior to Large Force Engagement or Dissimilar
       Air Combat Training (DACT) deployments, the WF will provide climatology outlooks to
       the squadron project officer. Weather personnel will be available for mass planning
       briefs, briefs prior to takeoff and in the event of a CORONET movement, will coordinate
       with the ACC project officer and provide all support required. In addition, should a
       flying squadron deploy to a location without indigenous weather support, the 56
       OSS/OSW has the capability to deploy a forecaster with the squadron.
       5.3.5.2. AEF Deployments. The WF can provide seasonal climatology information to
       requesting agencies for inclusion into reporting instructions given to AEF deployers.
5.4. Air Traffic Control (ATC) Limited Observation Training. ATC Limited Observing
Training is provided by the WF. The ATC individual seeking training will call the WF
(x2992/6805) and schedule an appointment to receive training. After ATC personnel complete
the training, they will take a short test on the information and receive a familiarization tour of the
weather station. Weather personnel will annotate the training in the ATC personnel’s training
record.
5.5. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Weather Updates. The WF is responsible for
ensuring all weather information in the FLIP is accurate. All weather related updates will be
LUKEAFBI15-101 11 OCTOBER 2011                                                                   25


requested through the Airfield Management FLIP manager, 56 OSS/OSAA. The FLIP Manager
will process the information to Air Force Flight Standards Agency. Updates will fall in one of
three categories: revisions, changes, or corrections.
5.6. Exercise Evaluation Team Member. 56 OSS/OSW is required to designate a primary and
alternate representative to support inspections, evaluations, and provide staff support during local
exercises. Required support will be coordinated by 56 FW/IGI.
5.7. Space Shuttle Ferry Support. The Luke WF may be asked to support shuttle ferry flights
as outlined in Appendix 3 To Annex C To 56 FW OPLAN 510.

                          RESOURCE PROTECTION SERVICES

6.1. General. Unless otherwise noted below and in the OWS-WF MOA, the Luke WF will
cooperate with the 25 OWS and follow guidance in AFMAN 15-129, Chapter 3 to issue weather
products (e.g. Weather Watches, Warnings and Advisories, or WWAs for short) for resource
protection at Luke AFB and the surrounding Flying Ranges. Specific rules governing format,
issuing, amending, extending and cancelling WWAs can be found in Tables 3.15 through 3.17 of
AFMAN 15-129 and will not be repeated here.
6.2. Weather Watches. A weather watch notifies operational commanders of a potential for
environmental conditions to such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property and are used to
make force protection and ORM decisions. Watches normally precede forecasted warnings and
are issued for a 5 NM radius from the center point of the Luke AFB runway complex. Weather
Watch criteria and desired lead-times are listed in Table 6.1.

6.5. Weather Warning, Watch & Advisory Format and Specifics. The text of weather
warnings, watches, and advisories will contain the warning/watch/advisory number, the specific
valid time period (until further notice for observed products), and specific conditions expected.
They will be numbered consecutively with the # of the month, and the # of the warning. For
example, the first warning issued in March will be #03-001; the next is #03-002. A warning for
observed lightning is the only criterion that will be issued separately from other warning criteria.
More than one advisory may be in effect at the same time. The following additional
requirements apply to warnings issued for criteria other than observed lightning.
   6.5.1. Only one warning will be in effect at a time (other than observed lightning), and it will
   include all elements meeting warning criteria.
   6.5.2. Warnings issued to add or delete a weather phenomenon (for example, adding hail
   greater than or equal to 1/2 inch to an existing warning for winds greater than 35 knots) will
   include the explanation ―This warning upgrades/downgrades Weather Warning # (previous
   warning).‖
   UPGRADES. The new warning forecasts more severe weather.
   DOWNGRADES. The new warning forecasts less severe weather.
   EXTENDS. The valid period of a previously issued warning is extended.
   6.5.3. Warnings and watches issued to extend the valid time will not be re-issued or re-
   numbered. These will include the explanation ―This is an extension of Weather Warning #
   (current warning).‖
   6.5.4. When the weather technician believes that phenomena meeting warning, watch, or
   advisory criteria are no longer expected during the valid time, they will be canceled with the
   explanation ―Weather Warning # (current warning) is canceled.‖ See Attachment 4 for
   dissemination formats.
6.6. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). WF and OWS leadership will outline
procedures to ensure sufficient personnel are available during potential/actual severe weather
events. The WF and OWS SWAP responsibilities are outlined in Attachment 3 of the OWS-WF
LUKEAFBI15-101 11 OCTOBER 2011                                                                29


MOA and include specific steps each unit will take to maximize support to Luke AFB during
severe weather threats. These steps include, but are not limited to, recalling personnel or
reallocating resources from other tasks to provide focused support during a severe weather event.
6.7. Severe Weather Reporting. AFI 10-206 requires the WF to submit weather data to
Command Post after certain severe weather situations for Operational Report 3 (OPREP-3)
reporting. The WF will keep procedures on-hand to comply with this directive. Attachment 2
shows a sample submission.
6.8. Hazard Plotting. Luke OPLAN 10-2 outlines Luke WF responsibilities during major
accident responses (e.g. nuclear accidents and terrorist strikes). The WF no longer produces
toxic corridor plotting itself but may be called upon by the 56 CES to produce weather data for
its use in computer plotting.

                                          Chapter 7

                     WEATHER INFORMATION DISSEMINATION

7.1. General. Timely and efficient dissemination of weather information is crucial to the
success of the FW mission and resource protection. This chapter describes WF dissemination
systems, dissemination procedures, and back-up systems and procedures.
7.2. Dissemination Systems.
   7.2.1. Automated Dissemination System (ADS). The Luke WF uses an automated
   dissemination system (ADS) as its primary method of disseminating observations, forecasts,
   warnings, watches, and advisories. The ADS runs on the base local area network (LAN) and
   consists of a series of a server distributing real-time data to computer terminals in the WF,
   RAPCON and Tower. Other base agencies can request the Luke WF for access to ADS data
   or will receive critical weather information through their unit’s own dissemination system
   (e.g., Pyramid Alert Recall, Unit Control Center, etc).
   7.2.2. Hotlines. Hotlines have been installed between the WF and other agencies for the
   sole purpose of rapidly exchanging weather data. Normal phone lines will be used in the
   event of a hotline outage. Hotlines are installed between the WF and the following agencies:
   56 FW Command Post, SOF, Tower, RAPCON, MOCC, 56 FW/CC, and 25 OWS.
7.3. Dissemination and Back-Up Procedures.
   7.3.1. MEFs. The Luke AFB and Range MEFs will be entered and disseminated via the WF
   website and/or through the ADS. If either the Intranet or the ADS is out of service, the WF
   will disseminate the information locally via fax, email or in-person to the Tower/SOF,
   RAPCON and Fighter Squadrons.
   7.3.2. Weather Observations. Observations will be disseminated through the ADS. When
   the ADS is out of service, observations will be disseminated long-line through the Joint Air
   Force and Army Weather Information Network (JAAWIN). If all long-line and local
   transmission resources are out of service, the WF will call the 25 OWS and have them
   disseminate. Locally, observations will be relayed via telephone or email to the following
   organizations when the ADS is out of service: SOF, Tower, RAPCON, Command Post,
   MOCC.
   7.3.3. Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories. The 25 OWS and WF will use the
   Integrated Weather Warning Communications System (IWWCS) as its primary
   dissemination system for all weather watches, warnings, and advisories. As a courtesy, the
   Luke WF will also call the agencies listed in the notification chains below. When the ADS is
   out of service, the WF will pass all information usually available via ADS over the phone.

                                          Chapter 8

                      WEATHER SYSTEMS AND MAINTENANCE

8.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological equipment used by
the Luke WF. The WF uses a wide range of equipment to determine the current state of the
atmosphere and formulate forecasts. Additionally, it provides information on back-up systems,
maintenance, and restoring priorities.
8.2. Weather Systems.
   8.2.1. FMQ-19. FMQ-19 is an integrated system of multiple weather sensors and data
   automation components across the airfield that continually measure environmental
   conditions. These sensors and components provide responsive, reliable, accurate, real-time
   weather information in support of flight operations. FMQ-19 accurately samples, measures,
   and reports: temperature, wind speed and direction, visibility, RVR, cloud base height and
   amount of coverage, pressure, liquid equivalent precipitation accumulation, and ice accretion
   during freezing precipitation. The handheld Kestrel provides backup should components of
   the FMQ-19 become non-operational.
   8.2.2. Lightning Detection. Lightning data is received via three sources. The first is
   LTS2005. LTS2005 is a subscription service that is not dependent on LAN availability and
   is tied into the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). The second is a java web
   application located on the JAAWIN webpage. It is also tied into the NLDN, but is dependent
   on LAN access. Each of these gives the ability to measure azimuth and range for each strike
   with respect to Luke AFB. The third source is the FMQ-19. This source is not as accurate
   and will only report a general location of the strike at a distance of less than 30 miles.
   LTS2005 and FMQ-19 are on backup generator support.
   8.2.3. Open Principal User Processor (OPUP). Also known as the WSR-88D Next
   Generation Radar (NEXRAD), the OPUP is a Doppler weather system. Control of the
   NEXRAD site at Williams-Gateway airport belongs to the Phoenix National Weather Service
   office. The OPUP is independent of LAN access and is also on backup generator power.
   Backup radar imagery and loops are available via numerous websites, which are LAN
   dependent.
   8.2.4. Mark IVB Meteorological Data Station. Mark IVB provides real-time
   meteorological satellite imagery that can be interrogated, enhanced and customized. It
   provides range, MOA and airfield overlays and greatly increases situational awareness in
   Arizona’s data sparse environment. Mark IVB is dependent on LAN availability. Backup
   imagery is available via numerous websites.
8.3. Maintenance. All equipment requires some sort of maintenance from time to time. The
following organizations provide preventive maintenance and repair weather and communications
equipment:

8.4. Building Power. Bldg 453 is equipped with a back-up generator. The generator should
start up automatically when power is cut-off to Bldg 453. In addition, 56 OSS/OSW maintains
an uninterrupted power supply capable of powering all critical systems for a 30 minute period.

                                          Chapter 9

                                    BACK-UP SUPPORT

9.1. General. There are dozens of scenarios that could cause an interruption of service from
either the 25 OWS or the Luke WF. This section briefly describes how weather services will be
provided should any such events occur. The Luke WF and 25 OWS outline specific
responsibilities and actions in the OWS-WF MOA.
9.2. 25 OWS. Per MOA 15-22, when weather operations at 25 OWS are interrupted (e.g.,
power outage, natural disaster, etc), associated TAF, weather watch and warning responsibility
may be transferred to the Luke WF until the 25 OWS is either postured to resume operations or
hand these operations to another OWS. Other 25 OWS weather information responsibilities
(e.g., graphical products) may be transferred to other agencies as necessary to continue weather
information to Luke AFB.
9.3. Luke WF. For standard station evacuations, support will resume from our alternate
weather operations site with the OWS assuming responsibilities during any interim period. For
longer interruptions, the WF will coordinate required support with other organizations. However,
when operational constraints prevent the WF from accomplishing the task, the 25 OWS may
produce and disseminate some tactical-level weather products (e.g., MEFs, verbal discussions,
faxed products, etc) on a short-term basis. When possible, the Luke WF will coordinate the
transfer of this responsibility to the 25 OWS in advance.
LUKEAFBI15-101 11 OCTOBER 2011                                                                 35

                                  RECIPROCAL SUPPORT

10.1. General. The agencies listed in this chapter will provide services as described below.
10.2. 56th Fighter Wing & Staff Agencies.
   10.2.1. 56 FW Commander (56 FW/CC). IAW AFI 10-229, the 56 FW/CC will chair a
   review of installation severe weather preparedness, capabilities, requirements and procedures
   no less than annually.
   10.2.2. 56 FW Command Post (CP).
       10.2.2.1. Monitor weather ADS for updates to weather conditions.
       10.2.2.2. Disseminate weather warnings, watches, and advisories according to Quick
       Reaction Checklists and notify the WF if the notification flow outlined in Section 7.3.3 of
       this document changes.
       10.2.2.3. Coordinate weather data used in initial and record copy of Operational Reports
       with Luke WF which involve severe weather, weather impacts to operations, aircraft
       mishaps or natural disasters at Luke AFB or involving Luke AFB assets. Upon
       notification, the WF will immediately provide all required archived weather data, issued
       warnings and watches, and status of meteorological equipment. Additionally, the Luke

1. Station identifier – also called the ICAO. This code identifies the location of the observation
(in this case Luke AFB).
2. Type of observation. There are two types of observations as described in Chap 3. METAR,
and SPECI.
3. Time. This is the time, in Zulu, that the last element of the observation was observed.
4. Wind. This portion of the observation provides the wind direction (first 3 numbers, VRB for
variable, or 000 for calm), sustained wind speed (next 2 or 3 numbers), and wind gusts (any
numbers following the G, if there have been any) measured in knots. One knot equals 1.14 miles
per hour.
5. Visibility. Distance visible on the landing end of the active sensor, reported in statute miles.
The most common visibility reported is 10 miles.
6. Present weather. Any weather phenomenon that is occurring on the airfield. This is
mandatory anytime the visibility is less than 7 miles. The table below lists the present weather
codes.

7. Sky Condition. Describes the amount of clouds present at the airfield. They fall into the
following categories:
        SKC – Sky Clear
        FEW – 1/8 to 2/8 coverage
        SCT – Scattered; 3/8 to 4/8 coverage
        BKN – Broken; 5/8 to 7/8 coverage
        OVC – Overcast; 8/8 coverage
        VV – Vertical visibility; normally used during heavy fog, indicates how far up into the
        fog can be seen
        FEW000/SCT000/BKN000 – Surface based obscuration
8. Cloud Height. Three-digit number which provides the height of the base of the cloud in
hundreds of feet (e.g., 015 equals 1500 feet). The CB and TCU descriptors may be appended to
the cloud height to indicate that the cloud is a cumulonimbus or towering cumulus.
9. Format: Temperature/Dew Point (*in degrees Celsius unless otherwise noted).
10. Altimeter Setting. The pressure value to which an aircraft altimeter scale is set so that the
altimeter indicates the altitude above mean sea level of an aircraft on the ground at the location
for which the value was determined. The altimeter is measured in inches (INS) of mercury.
11. Remarks. The following list contains most of the remarks commonly seen in observations:
        AO2A – Augmented by human observer ACC – Altocumulus Castellanas
        CB – Cumulonimbus                                     CONS – Continuous
        DSNT – Distant                                        DSIPTD – Dissipated
        ESTMD – Estimated                                     FROPA – Frontal Passage
        FRQ – Frequent                                        LTG – Lightning
        LWR – Lower                                           MOV – Moving
        MOVD – Moved                                          OCNL – Occasional
        OHD – Overhead                                   PK WND – Peak Wind
        PRESFR – Pressure Falling Rapidly                     PRESRR – Pressure Rapidly Rising
        RWY – Runway                                          TCU – Towering Cumulus
        TWR – Tower                                           VIS – Visibility
        WSHFT – Wind Shift                           STNRY – Stationary
        PA – Pressure Altitude                           DA – Density Altitude

12. Time and Initials. This is the time (minutes past the hour) that the observation was
disseminated and the initials of the individual who took the observation.

The forecast follows the same general format as the observation with the following exceptions:
1. Valid Date /Time. Forecasts are generally valid for a 24-hour period. In this example the
forecast is valid from the 1st at 1200 Zulu (or GMT) until the 2nd at 1200 Z.
2. Wind. Provides the wind direction (first 3 numbers, VRB for variable), sustained wind speed
(next 2 or 3 numbers), and wind gusts (any numbers following the G, if there have been any)
measured in knots. One knot equals 1.14 miles per hour.
3. QNH. Lowest forecasted altimeter setting (for that time period) in inches of mercury.
4. BECMG – This is a code to indicate that the predominant condition will change to (or
become) the conditions listed in that line of the forecast. The conditions will change during the
time period that follows the BECMG code (1700 to 1800Z in the above example) and be
predominant by 1800Z.
5. TEMPO – This code means that the conditions listed on that line may occur for periods of an
hour or less (an hour and 15 minutes or less for thunderstorms) anytime between the time frame
following the TEMPO code (1900Z to 2200Z in this example).
6. T24 indicates a maximum temperature in Celsius to occur at 20Z. T10 indicates a minimum
temperature of 10 Celsius to occur at 12Z (note: M indicates a minus sign in front of the
number: TM05 = -5 C).
