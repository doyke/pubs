   16.2. Gas Masks. A 5% safety level is authorized for gas masks to support tariff sizing and
   requirements fluctuation.
17. Funding/Requisitioning Mobility Bag and Weapons Requirements Policy. The LRS/CC
is responsible for ensuring that funding is received for mobility bags and support kit shortfalls
for their wing/installation.
   17.1. IPEE budget requirements. The IPEE will ensure the annual dollar requirements are
   included in the base Operations and Maintenance (O&M) financial plan for all A and B
   mobility bag requirements.
   17.2. Budget for weapons cleaning support kits, initial and replacement requirements.
   17.3. Budget for gas mask support kits, initial and replacement requirements.
18. Funds management Responsibilities. Funds will be allocated to the established PFMR and
Organization Cost Center Record (OCCR) from the operating program in accordance with the
established budget and funding practices. Funding for all C-1 bags will be transferred to the
appropriate installation Operating Budget Account Number (OBAN) by AMC/A7CX Resource
Management.
   18.1. Establish PFMRs exclusively for mobility bag requirements.
   18.2. Establish an OCCR for each activity requiring mobility bags (host/tenant).
   18.3. Use shop code MK for all type A and B mobility bag orders.
   18.4. Use shop code CW for C-1 bags, gas masks, and gas mask support kit parts.
   18.5. Use shop code WE for weapons and weapon cleaning kits.
   18.6. MICAS will be used to establish a funding baseline for all mobility bag assets. Bases
   are no longer required to backorder assets with TEX Code ―H‖.
   18.7. Use normal supply procedures for requisitioning of mobility bag assets. Some assets
   may need to be ordered against a specific Emergency and Special Processing code (ESP) for
   reimbursement consideration for certain contingency operations. A special account will have
   to be established with the appropriate ESP Code for this type of situation. LRS IPEE with
   work closely with the Resource Advisor (RA) to ensure this is done properly.
   18.8. Guard and Reserve Tenant Units. Guard and Reserve tenant units will be required to
   fund for their CWDE mobility assets separately through their specific higher headquarters
   because of Guard and Reserve specific program element codes (PECs) 55165 and 55166.
19. Training Protective Equipment. Units will check with the host LRS/IPEE and Defense
Logistics Agency-Disposition Services (DLA-DS) for assets available for training use. DLA-DS
sourcing should consider worldwide sourcing when necessary.
20. Gas Mask Storage. Gas Masks will not be stored in built-up C-1 bags. Doing so may result
in disbanding and negatively affect the proper form and fit of these masks.
21. Special Sized Equipment. Situations may arise where specially-sized equipment must be
purchased to outfit personnel.
 8                                                               AMCI23-150 11 OCTOBER 2011


     21.1. IPEE will follow special measurement clothing and footwear requisitioning
     instructions as outlined in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 23 and Volume 1,
     Part 1, Chapter 25 (i.e., XXLRG JSLIST suits, Size 20 GVO, etc.)
     21.2. When these assets are ordered, the unit requiring the specially sized item will fund for
     the item. Once the item is received by the IPEE, it will be a permanent issue to the individual
     for as long as they are in the military. These items will be electronically manifested out of
     MICAS when the individual Permanent Change of Station’s (PCS) to another base to allow
     for the gaining base to pick up accountability.
22. Tariff Sizing. The IPEE operates the centralized storage point from a tariff sized concept
to support the deployment process. Some sizes of assets may require very few to be stored
depending on the sizes of the individuals, however, it is recommended that quantities of all sizes
available be maintained to support deploying members, if needed. This may constitute a very
small tariff percentage which equates to only a few items for those extreme sizes (XXXSM,
XXXLRG, Size 20 GVO, etc.). Recommended tariffs are found in Attachment 2 and Attachment
3.
23. Shelf-Life. The storing activity is responsible to perform visual and shelf-life inspections in
accordance with the applicable technical orders.
     23.1. Inspect the components of the mobility bag upon initial assembly.
     23.2. Inspect the components of the mobility bag at time of issue.
     23.3. Ensure shelf-life procedures are followed IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 7, Part 3,
