This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 51-9, Civil Law for Individuals, and provides the
framework for the disposition of juvenile misconduct cases and the treatment of juvenile offenders. The
purpose of this instruction is to establish responsibilities and procedures for the administrative disposition
of misconduct committed by juveniles on the United States Air Force Academy and to establish the
United States Air Force Academy Juvenile Assistance Council (JAC). The JAC will hear all cases in
which a juvenile is alleged to have engaged in misconduct or cases referred to it by the 10th Air Base
Wing (10 ABW). The JAC will determine the appropriate disposition of the case by weighing the best
interests of the juvenile and the United States Air Force Academy. The action taken will be designed to
attain the primary goal of maintaining good order and discipline on the United States Air Force Academy
and, if possible, to rehabilitate the juvenile offender. This instruction applies to juveniles who engage in
misconduct on the United States Air Force Academy and are dependents of personnel stationed at the
United States Air Force Academy (to include all personnel administratively assigned to 10 ABW) or
dependents of active duty or retired military personnel using the United States Air Force Academy facili-
ties. This instruction also applies to the sponsors of juveniles who engage in misconduct on the United
States Air Force Academy. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office
of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN33-363), Management of Records, and dis-

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision adds the Assistant Staff Judge Advocate (ASJA) to paragraph 2.3.2.3., updates the reference
in paragraph 5.1., updates the forms adopted in paragraph 6., and updates the sample for JAC proceedings
in Attachment 7. A bar ( | ) indicates revisions from the previous edition.


1. Authority:
    1.1. Public Law 94-415, Juvenile Justice and the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of
    1974 (18 United States Code (U.S.C.) Sections 5031-5042), applies to the United States Air Force
    Academy. The statute provides that misconduct committed by a juvenile should be disposed of outside
    the federal courts whenever feasible. Accordingly, this instruction establishes an administrative sys-
    tem in lieu of juvenile delinquency proceedings or prosecution in U.S. Magistrate’s Court.
    1.2. Moreover, the installation commander is charged with the responsibility for maintaining law and
    order on the base (AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program). To achieve this goal, the
    commander may demand that any juvenile charged with misconduct explain why base privileges
    should not be limited or revoked. Privileges subject to revocation include the following: Base
    Exchange privileges, commissary privileges, housing privileges, shoppette privileges, base driving
    privileges, and the privilege of entering any part (or all) of the base. This instruction complies with the
    foregoing law and instruction by ensuring that an offense involving a juvenile is identified, adjudi-
    cated, and disposed of in a manner that maintains good order and discipline while stressing deterrence
    and rehabilitation of the juvenile.

2. Purpose of the JAC:
    2.1. The JAC is designed to:
       2.1.1. Maintain good order and discipline on the United States Air Force Academy.
       2.1.2. Educate juveniles and their sponsors on the consequences of misconduct and crime (i.e., the
       impact crime has on the juvenile offender, the offender’s family, the victims, and the community).
       2.1.3. Rehabilitate juveniles through counseling, education, community service, restitution, and
       other means of corrective action as recommended by the JAC and ordered by the Commander of
       the 10th Air Base Wing (10 ABW/CC). Therefore, all actions should be designed to prevent fur-
       ther misconduct and instill respect for the law in the United States Air Force Academy’s young
       people.
       2.1.4. Protect the best interests of both the juvenile and the United States Air Force Academy
       community. Accordingly, the system avoids labeling the juveniles with the stigma of “criminal” or
       “delinquent.” Rather, the term “juvenile offender” is used in this instruction.
    2.2. Participation in the JAC Program. Participation by the juvenile in the JAC Program is voluntary.
    However, certain administrative sanctions may be taken against a juvenile offender even if the juve-
    nile refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of the JAC. (For example, the installation commander,
    10 ABW/CC, retains the authority to bar the juvenile from base, and to terminate on-base housing
    privileges of the juvenile’s family.) Conversely, certain rehabilitative measures, such as referral to
    counseling, performance of community service, or participation in a work program by the juvenile
USAFAI51-903 9 OCTOBER 2007                                                                              3


   offender, may only be undertaken if the juvenile agrees to submit to the JAC’s jurisdiction. Rescission
   of administrative sanctions (e.g., reinstatement of privileges) may be contingent upon the juvenile’s
   consent to the jurisdiction of the JAC and satisfactory completion by the juvenile offender and/or his
   or her sponsor of such rehabilitative measures ordered by the JAC. If the juvenile refuses to submit to
   the jurisdiction of the JAC, the JAC may refer the case to the Special Assistant U.S. Attorney for pros-
   ecution as a petty offense under 18 U.S.C., Section 5032, as may be permitted by law.
   2.3. Composition of the JAC:
       2.3.1. The Deputy Commander, 10th Mission Support Group (10 MSG/CD), shall serve as the
       JAC Chairman.
       2.3.2. The council will consist of representatives, as approved by the JAC Chairman, from the fol-
       lowing member organizations:
          2.3.2.1. Chaplain (10 ABW/HC).
          2.3.2.2. 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander (10 SFS/CC).
          2.3.2.3. Staff Judge Advocate (HQ USAFA/JA) or an Assistant Staff Judge Advocate (ASJA)
          appointed by the SJA.
          2.3.2.4. Family Advocacy (10 MDOS/SGOMHF).
          2.3.2.5. Special invited guests, such as a representative from the Airmen and Family Readi-
          ness Center (10 MSS/DPF) or the Military Family Housing Office (10 CES/CEH), as neces-
          sary. Guests may include the sponsor’s Commander and First Sergeant.
   2.4. JAC Members. Members will endeavor to provide continuity of attendees (i.e., avoid turnover of
   JAC member representatives whenever possible).

3. Responsibilities:
   3.1. 10th Security Forces (10 SFS) will:
       3.1.1. Prepare an AF Form 3545, Incident Report, or a Report of Investigation (ROI).
       3.1.2. As appropriate, issue the juvenile a memorandum signed by the Commander, 10th Mission
       Support Group (10 MSG/CC), that immediately limits the juvenile’s on-base privileges (see
       Attachment 3; also see Attachment 2, Format for Memorandums in Attachment 3 through
       Attachment 6).
       3.1.3. Notify the juvenile’s sponsor’s Unit First Sergeant or Commander.
       3.1.4. Send the AF Form 3545 and a copy of the limited privileges letter to the Staff Judge Advo-
       cate.
   3.2. HQ USAFA/JA will:
       3.2.1. Issue a notification memorandum (see Attachment 4), signed by the Commander of the
       10th Air Base Wing (10 ABW/CC), to the juvenile, and serve a copy on the juvenile’s parents or
       sponsor informing them of the charge. An information copy will be sent to the sponsor’s unit com-
       mander.
       3.2.2. Reflect on the notification date, time, and location of the meeting of the JAC. The meeting
       date on the memorandum shall be the next available meeting date from the date of the incident.
4                                                                    USAFAI51-903 9 OCTOBER 2007

       attendance.
       3.2.6. Record the minutes of JAC meetings and provide copies to the JAC Chairman for review.

       dum (see Attachment 5) for the 10 ABW/CC’s signature, addressed to the juvenile offender,
       announcing the final disposition of the case. The memorandum shall also include information
       regarding community service, counseling referrals, etc., if applicable. Once signed and returned
       by the 10 ABW/CC, HQ USAFA/JA will ensure the signed memorandum is mailed to the juvenile
       offender and his or her sponsor and a copy forwarded to Report & Analysis (10 SFS/S5R) and
       Administrative Support (10 MSS/DPMPS).
       3.2.8. If any of the juvenile offender’s privileges are to be revoked, HQ USAFA/JA will prepare a
       revocation memorandum (see Attachment 6) for the 10 ABW/CC’s signature, addressed to the
       sponsor, directing the sponsor to apply for a replacement identification card for the juvenile
       offender with limited privileges. Once signed and returned by the Vice Commander of 10th Air
       Base Wing (10 ABW/CV), HQ USAFA/JA will ensure the signed memorandum is mailed to the
       juvenile offender and his or her sponsor and a copy forwarded to 10 MSS/DPMPS.
    3.3. The JAC will:
       3.3.1. Meet as directed by the JAC Chairman to review cases of juvenile misconduct. The JAC

       her discretion and direct that cases be considered at the next meeting.
       3.3.2. Recommend an appropriate command response to the misconduct, including but not lim-

SUBJECT: Juvenile Assistance Council Decision


1. On __________________(date), you met with the Juvenile Assistance Council (JAC) to determine if you were involved in
a (shoplifting incident) at the (Base Exchange) at the United States Air Force Academy. The Council decided you were
involved as alleged. Because of your involvement with the misconduct, you must comply with the following actions:


         a. Your Base Exchange privileges will be revoked for a period of (six (6) months).


         b. You must complete the ________________________________________________(course) by
         ______________(date). You should call _______________(contact) before _________(date) at
         __________________(telephone) to schedule the class. The return of your privileges on base is contingent upon
         completion of this class.


         c. You must complete ________ hours of community service by ___________(date). You should call
         ____________________________(contact) to schedule those hours.

         d. Other actions as appropriate.


2. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in further action being taken, including but not limited to referral of
your case to the Special Assistant U.S. Attorney for prosecution as a petty offense under 18 U.S.C. section 5032 in U.S. Mag-
istrate’s Court.


3. Good order and discipline must be maintained on this base. (You must understand that taking items that do not belong to you
is wrong.) I believe you understand what is right and wrong. If you learn from this experience, perhaps some good will come
of an otherwise unfortunate incident. You have the intelligence and potential to do much better, and I am certain you can.

                            SAMPLE SCRIPT FOR JAC PROCEEDINGS
CHAIR: This Hearing will come to order. I am _______________________, chairperson. This Hearing
is convened under the provisions of USAFAI 51-903, by order of ___________________________, 10th
Air Base Wing Commander. The respondent is/is not present. The respondent’s sponsor is present.


CHAIR: The purpose of this Hearing is to make Findings of Fact regarding the respondent’s alleged mis-
conduct ___________________________. The Hearing is to explore alternative solutions and recom-
mend corrective action(s) to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander. When selecting appropriate
administrative sanctions to recommend, the Hearing board will evaluate the respondent’s prior record of
misconduct, the seriousness of the misconduct, the degree of parental guidance and discipline evident and
the availability of community agencies to support any corrective action/sanctions recommended.


JA: My name is _________________________, USAFA Legal Office. I am the Legal Advisor for this
proceeding. As Legal Advisor, I ensure that you receive a fair, impartial, and orderly Hearing. The Chair-
person will now introduce the other members of the Hearing.


CHAIR: The JAC is not bound by formal rules of evidence prescribed for criminal trials. Furthermore, an
administrative Hearing does not employ the “beyond-a-reasonable-doubt” standard. On the contrary,
administrative hearings seek to find all the relevant facts from the best evidence that is available and they
employ a “preponderance-of-evidence” test in making their findings.


CHAIR: I will now advise you of your legal rights in this Hearing:


CHAIR: First, you have the right to appear before all open sessions of this Hearing in person.


CHAIR: You are entitled to the rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitu-
tion. You may or may not provide sworn testimony before the Hearing. This is your decision. If you do not
elect to provide sworn testimony, you may make an unsworn statement to the Hearing either personally or
through your sponsor, orally, in writing, or both. If you do not choose to testify or make a statement, the
Hearing will not consider your silence as an admission of truth of the evidence that has been presented
against you.


CHAIR: Finally, you have the right during the proceedings of this Hearing to submit evidence, including
matters in extenuation and mitigation. Extenuation means those facts or circumstances that lessen the
impact of your misconduct. It is also appropriate to share with us those things that will impact you and
your family or actions that you have taken to correct your behavior. Mitigation means those facts and cir-
cumstances that you think could reduce the severity of recommendations made by this Hearing. You may

submit any evidence you desire to the Hearing to consider, including sworn or unsworn statements, affi-
davits, certificates, or stipulations.
CHAIR: Do you understand the purpose of this Hearing and your rights as respondent before it?


RESP: Yes/No. (Explore any area the Respondent does not understand.)


CHAIR: The JAC may not impose certain rehabilitative measures against you, the juvenile, unless you
agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the JAC. If you refuse to submit to the jurisdiction of the JAC, the
JAC may refer the case to the Special Assistant U.S. Attorney for prosecution as a petty offense. Admin-
istrative sanctions such as barring you from base or terminating your family’s on-base housing privileges
can still be imposed even without the your consent. Do you understand that you do not have to submit to
the jurisdiction of the JAC?


RESP: Yes/No


CHAIR: Do you understand that your presence and cooperation here is voluntary and that you may
choose to leave at any time, at which time the Hearing would continue to consider evidence without your
presence?


RESP: Yes/No


CHAIR: Knowing that if you refuse to submit to the jurisdiction of the JAC, the JAC may refer the case
to the Special Assistant U.S. Attorney for prosecution, do you wish to submit to the JAC’s jurisdiction?


RESP: Yes/No.


CHAIR: In a few minutes, I will state the misconduct you are accused of. You will then be asked to
respond to the allegations. The Hearing members will ask you questions. After the discussion of these
questions between the respondent and Hearing members, or your admission of misconduct, you will be
given the opportunity to present evidence in defense. As I advised you earlier, you do not have to make a
statement yourself, nor can any inference be drawn from your silence.


CHAIR: The Hearing may recommend any combination of the following actions:


       a. Sponsor Counseled
       b. Apology
