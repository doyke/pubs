This McConnell Air Force Base Instruction (MAFBI) implements AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment
Maintenance Management and 1C-135A-6, outlining responsibilities and procedures for the identifica-
tion and inspection of aircraft performing low or very low altitude air refueling missions. The 22d Oper-
ations Group, 22d Maintenance Group and 931st Air Refueling Group will ensure compliance with all
procedures outlined in this instruction. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed
in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363),
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/. Refer recommended changes and questions about this pub-
lication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of
command.


1. Definitions:
   1.1. Low Altitude Operations (LAO) and Very Low Altitude Operations (VLAO) do not include nor-
   mal departures, arrivals or traffic pattern operations. Properly classifying operations, documenting
   flying schedules with intended operations and documenting aircraft AFTO 781A, Maintenance Dis-
   crepancy and Work Document, forms after operating in LAO or VLAO are required to ensure aircraft
   airworthiness.
   1.2. The LAO environment is defined as aircraft operating at airspeeds above 240 knots indicated air-
   speed (KIAS) and at altitudes from 3,000 to 6,000 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). Substantial
   visual airframe special inspections are required upon accumulation of 25 flight hours of LAO.
   1.3. The VLAO environment is defined as aircraft operating above 240 KIAS and at altitudes below
   3,000 feet AGL. Substantial visual and non-destructive inspection (NDI) airframe special inspections
   are required to be performed by maintenance personnel prior to aircraft operating in VLAO. Once

    complete, aircraft are cleared to operate for an accumulation of 50 flight hours in VLAO environ-
    ments. Upon accumulation of 50 VLAO flight hours, the aircraft must be removed from service and
    re-inspected.

2. Responsibilities:
    2.1. It is imperative schedulers, operators and maintenance supervisors coordinate the following
    actions as appropriate whether at home-station, on temporary duty, or deployed. These home-station
    procedures apply wherever 22 ARW aircraft are operated.
    2.2. Contact lead command for VLAO approval, contact OC-ALC/LCRA for any overdue individual
    aircraft tracking program (IATP) inspections that must be performed prior to any VLAO operations.
    2.3. LAO and VLAO missions must be pre-coordinated. 22d Operations Support Squadron schedul-
    ing (OSS/OSOS) will notify 22d Maintenance Operations Squadron Plans, Scheduling and Documen-
    tation (PS&D) of all anticipated LAO or VLAO missions.
    2.4. OSOS will annotate “IMPLEMENT MAFBI 21-101 for LAO” or “IMPLEMENT MAFBI
    21-101 for VLAO” as applicable in the remarks block of the flying schedule.
    2.5. PS&D will coordinate with 22d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) to ensure aircraft are
    properly identified and inspections are tracked/accomplished for use in LAO and VLAO environ-
    ments.
    2.6. AMXS will track LAO and VLAO hours and perform inspections as required in accordance with
    TO 1C-135A-6.
    2.7. The aircraft commander will annotate a pilot reported discrepancy in the AFTO Form 781A (Red
    Diagonal “/”) anytime LAO or VLAO operations are conducted. The discrepancy will include a state-
    ment including: LAO or VLAO, aircraft configuration (gear & flap positions) and duration in the
    LAO/VLAO environment.
    2.8. During post-flight debriefing, AMXS will enter a Red Dash “–” ground-found discrepancy stat-
    ing, “Post LAO or VLAO -6 inspections required” in the next available AFTO Form 781A discrep-
    ancy block upon accumulation of LAO or VLAO inspection hour criteria.
