                                          Chapter 1

         GENERAL PROVISIONS, AUTHORITIES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Purpose. This manual describes basic procedures for managing and administering the AF
NAF Civilian Personnel Program. It also confers authority upon those responsible for
administration of the program.
1.2. Applicability. This manual applies to AF NAF employees. It does not apply to:
   1.2.1. Employees of private organizations authorized to operate on installations in
   accordance with AFI 34-223, Private Organizations (PO) Program.
   1.2.2. AF APF civilian employees and military personnel who perform assigned duties in
   FSS activities.
   1.2.3. Independent contractors, such as professional entertainers and sports officials, where
   no employeremployee relationship exists.
   1.2.4. Individuals employed by contractors and concessionaires doing business with NAFIs.
   1.2.5. Local nationals or third country nationals employed in United States (U.S.) territories
   or possessions and foreign areas when such nationals are subject to the requirements of
   treaties or countrytocountry agreements.
   1.2.6. Employees of AAFES.
   1.2.7. Volunteers or individuals serving as Family Home Day Care Providers under the
   Family Home Day Care Program.
   1.2.8. Air National Guard units and members.
1.3. Authority and Responsibility. The authority and responsibility to manage civilian
employees of AF NAFIs flows from the Secretary of the Air Force, who bears ultimate authority
and responsibility, to the Chief of Staff, and successively, to commanders of MAJCOM, or
comparable organizations, subordinate commanders, and, ultimately, to first level supervisors.
Each level in the chain of command has personnel management responsibilities, from overall
policy-making responsibilities at the top management level to immediate supervisory
responsibilities at the operating level.
   1.3.1. Personnel Management Authority. Supervisors know the mission requirements, job
   needs, and the employees assigned to their organizations and carry out personnel
   management responsibilities. As a minimum, management must give supervisors authority
   and responsibility to:
       1.3.1.1. Select employees and assure their proper placement and use; recommend
       employees for promotion and reassignment.
       1.3.1.2. Assign duties and certify the accuracy of position guides (PG) and position
       descriptions (PD).
       1.3.1.3. Establish work standards and evaluate employee performance and conduct; take
       or initiate corrective action when an employee’s performance or conduct is not
       acceptable; and recognize superior performance.
14                                                        AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


        1.3.1.4. Identify training needs; conduct on-the-job training (OJT); recommend other
        training; and evaluate training results.
        1.3.1.5. Resolve complaints, grievances, and maintain discipline.
        1.3.1.6. Carryout affirmative actions in support of equal opportunity objectives.
        1.3.1.7. Observe the laws, policies, and guidelines applicable to the NAF Civilian
        Personnel Program and merit system principles in 5 U.S.C. 2301(b), and prohibited
        personnel practices in 5 U.S.C. 2302(b).
        1.3.1.8. Discharge all duties without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
        age, handicapping condition, marital status, political affiliation, or any other non-merit
        factor.
        1.3.1.9. When required, coordinate proposed actions and decisions with, or obtain prior
        approval of a higher-level supervisor and/or the Chief, Human Resources. When a
        supervisor does not use an authority properly, the Force Support Squadron (FSS)
        commander/director may withdraw the authority and assign it to a higher-level supervisor
        pending the outcome of an inquiry.
        1.3.1.10. Delegation of personnel management authority to first-level supervisors does
        not relieve higher-level officials from responsibility for effective management. They are
        responsible for the groups of employees and the overall use of the total workforce within
        their organization. They must make sure their subordinate supervisors manage properly
        and effectively and they adhere to the legal and procedural requirements applicable to the
        AF NAF Civilian Personnel Program.
1.4. Appointing Authority. Appointing authority is the authority to appoint, classify, promote,
reassign, discipline, demote, detail, compensate, separate, or affect other related personnel and
position transactions that involve NAF employees. This authority is granted to the Secretary of
the Air Force and delegated to installation commanders assigned an AF NAF-Human Resources
(HR) Section. The Chief, Human Resources acts for the installation commander in the
administration of this authority as it pertains to the NAF personnel program.
     1.4.1. Actions taken under this authority shall conform with all legal and regulatory
     requirements applicable to the AF NAF Civilian Personnel Program.
     1.4.2. Some instructions pertaining to NAF personnel administration assign authority and
     responsibility for certain personnel management actions and decisions inherent to appointing
     authority, to specified positions, organizations, or organizational levels. The delegation of
     appointing authority as addressed in this section does not limit those with appointing
     authority, or organization’s authority or responsibility to take these actions as specified in
     this manual and other AF or Department of Defense (DoD) instructions.
     1.4.3. Responsibilities inherent to appointing authority:
        1.4.3.1. Installation Commanders. Generally, commanders must ensure through their
        FSS Commanders/Directors and Chief, Human Resources that serviced organization
        management officials and supervisors are fully informed of and comply with this manual
        and other legal and regulatory requirements pertinent to the AF NAF personnel program.
        They also ensure all personnel actions are authorized and comply with legal, policy, and
        regulatory requirements.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                15


      1.4.3.2. Chief, Human Resources. The Chief, Human Resources has authority and
      responsibility for the functions outlined in this manual.
          1.4.3.2.1. The role of the Chief, Human Resources is to administer the use of
          appointing authority. In carrying out this role, the NAF-HR staff advises and helps
          management meet personnel needs and solve personnel problems. The NAF-HR staff
          must make sure programs and actions comply fully with the spirit and intent of laws,
          regulations, and policies.
          1.4.3.2.2. The Chief, Human Resources acts for the installation commander in the
          administration of the appointing authority as it pertains to the NAF personnel
          program. They approve and issue all required notices of personnel and position
          actions. This authority to act for the installation commander remains in effect unless
          limited or withdrawn in writing by the installation commander.
1.5. Legal Status of NAF Civilian Employees. NAF employees are Federal employees within
the DoD, but are not subject to many personnel laws administered by the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) for APF employees. Section 2105(c) of 5 U.S.C. explains this status and
identifies the OPM-administered laws that cover NAF employees unless otherwise specifically
stated. Because these employees are paid with NAFs, they are distinguished from other AF
civilian employees paid from funds appropriated by Congress.
1.6. Terms Explained.
   1.6.1. APF Employee. A person paid from funds appropriated by the Congress.
   1.6.2. Concessionaire. An entrepreneur under contract to an authorized NAFI to provide
   goods or services.
   1.6.3. DoD Components. The DoD components consist of the Office of the Secretary of
   Defense (OSD), the Military Departments, the Services, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
   Staff (CJCS) and the Joint Staff, the unified commands, and Defense agencies.
   1.6.4. NAF-HR. The personnel office that services AF NAFIs.
   1.6.5. Individual Services Contracts. A written agreement between an individual and a
   NAFI to perform specified duties on a one-time or otherwise short-term basis. The contract
   does not establish an employee-employer relationship.

     1.6.10. NAF Employees. Persons who are employed in, and receive compensation from a
     NAFI.
     1.6.11. NAFI. A NAFI is an integral DoD fiscal and organizational entity performing an
     essential government function. It acts in its own name to furnish or to assist other DoD
     organizations primarily in providing MWR or Lodging programs for military people, family
     members, and authorized civilians. It is established and operated individually or jointly by
     the heads of the service departments. Its custodian and designated representatives exercise
     reasonable care to prudently administer, safeguard, preserve, and maintain those resources
     made available to carry out its function.

     1.6.14. Service Computation Date (SCD):
        1.6.14.1. The leave SCD is usually the date of appointment or conversion to regular

        of creditable DoD service. Certain periods of military service may be creditable for leave
        SCD purposes.
        1.6.14.2. Creditable service for the reduction-in-force (RIF) SCD does not include

     regular and flexible. Supervisors determine which type of category to use. The following
     describes the compensation and benefits for each type of employment category.
        1.7.1.1. Regular Employment Category. Regular employees are guaranteed a
        minimum of 20 hours to a maximum of 40 hours of work per week, and they receive
        benefits. Regular employees must be given a 24-hour notice of a schedule change.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              17

18                                                     AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


           the past 6 months, will either be changed to regular category, or the FSS
           Commander/Director will request a waiver to change of category. The MAJCOM
           Chiefs of Services provide active oversight to include review and approval of all
           base-level waiver requests.
           1.7.1.2.2. Process and Procedures:
              1.7.1.2.2.1. Identification of Appropriate Flexible Workforce.           On a
              semiannual basis, NAF-HRs utilizing the Discover Viewer reporting tool, review
              total hours worked for each flexible employee. The report, Flexible Employee
              Hourly Review, provides the hours worked data for each employee by cost center.
              Attachment 2 contains instructions for navigating Discover Viewer to obtain the
              report.
The first semiannual report contains pay periods 1- 13 (A – M).

The second semiannual report contains pay periods 14 – 26 (N – Z).
              1.7.1.2.2.2. Management Review and Action. The NAF-HR prepares a memo
              and forwards listing for each flexible employee whose hours worked for the
              semiannual period exceeds 780 hours to the appropriate Flight Chief for review
              and action.
                  1.7.1.2.2.2.1. The memo advises the Flight Chief of those flexible employees
                  working in excess of 780 hours during the reporting period as illustrated on
                  the attached listings and that he/she must take one of the following actions:
                    1.7.1.2.2.2.1.1. Change the flexible employee to regular employment
                    category, or
                    1.7.1.2.2.2.1.2. Provide justification for number of hours worked and intent
                    not to make employee regular. Examples of acceptable justification for
                    working a flexible employee in excess of thirty hours per week on a
                    temporary basis include:
                    To fill in for John/Susie Q. Employee, regular employment category who
                    was:

                    Called to active duty for period _____.

                    _____.

                    Other extenuating circumstances (must be explained in detail).

Per employee request. For example, military spouse preference may be lost upon change to
regular employment category. Any flexible employee electing to decline a change to regular
employment category is required to make such declination in writing only after being
provided a full explanation by the NAF-HR of the benefits of regular employment category.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                             19


                 1.7.1.2.2.2.1.3. The Flight Chief completes management action portion of

                 Attaches an AF Form 2548, NAFI Request for Personnel Action, for each
                 flexible employee being changed to regular employment category.
                 Management determines the guaranteed hours upon change to regular
                 employment category and ensures they are established no lower than the
                 minimum requirement for regular employment category, twenty hours per
                 week.

                 Forwards the memo to the NAF-HR for action.
        1.7.1.2.3. NAF-HR Final Action. Upon receipt of the memo from management, the
        NAF-HR takes the following actions:
            1.7.1.2.3.1. Processes personnel actions on those flexible employees identified
            for change to regular employment category.
            1.7.1.2.3.2. For flexible employees not being changed to regular employment
            category, the NAF-HR will prepare a request memo for the FSS
            Commander/Director’s signature and forwards the request to the MAJCOM Chief
            of Services for review and approval.
            1.7.1.2.3.3. The MAJCOMs review written decisions for each submitted waiver
            to include rationale for disapproval decisions. Upon receipt of the Command
            decision, the NAF-HR takes the following actions:
               1.7.1.2.3.3.1. If the MAJCOM disapproves the FSS Commander/Director’s
               request, the NAF-HR processes a personnel action on each identified flexible
               employee changing them to regular employment category. The effective date
               for the personnel action is the first day of the first pay period immediately
               following the date of the Command decision.
               1.7.1.2.3.3.2. If the Command approves the FSS Commander/Director’s
               request, the NAF-HR retains the memo and listings for those employees not
               being changed to regular employment category in the office’s official files.
        1.7.1.2.4. Review Completion. Each semiannual review is completed not later than
        45 days following the end of the review period.
     1.7.1.3. Limited Term Appointments. This type of appointment is not expected to last
     indefinitely. It is used to meet seasonal or nonrecurring one-time requirements, and
     summer employment; to fill a continuing position when the incumbent is absent due to
     temporary duty (TDY), extended leave, temporary promotion, etc.; or to fill a vacancy
     that is programmed for cancellation within a specific timeframe.
        1.7.1.3.1. Limited term appointments may be regular or flexible category. Benefits
        and compensation applicable to the normal regular and flexible appointments apply.

            1.7.1.3.2. When using this type of appointment, a not-to-exceed (NTE) date must be
            established prior to filling the position. The applicant or employee is advised in
            advance that the appointment is a limited term appointment, the NTE date, and the
            appointment may be terminated at any time prior to the NTE date.
            1.7.1.3.3. The NAF-HR terminates the appointment effective on the NTE date, unless
            an approved request to extend or terminate the employee is received prior to the NTE
            date. The appropriate Nature of Action (NOA) is N046, Termination. The AF Form
            2545, NAFI Notification of Personnel Action, Block 25, must show the remark,
            "Expiration of Appointment."

            (NOAC) and NOA, N012, Appointment NTE.
1.8. Hours of Work.
     1.8.1. Administrative Work Week. The administrative workweek consists of seven
     consecutive calendar days. It does not have to coincide with the calendar week, and may
     begin on any day and at any hour.
     1.8.2. Guaranteed Work Week. Within the administrative workweek, the guaranteed
     workweek for NAF employees will not exceed 40 hours, exclusive of meal times. When
     possible, two consecutive days off are provided during each administrative workweek.
     However, the guaranteed workweek may be scheduled over a period of 6 days, provided that
     the total scheduled hours do not exceed 40 hours per week.
     1.8.3. Tours of Duty. A tour of duty is a work schedule of those days of the week and hours
     of the day that an employee is required to be on duty. The tour of duty is at least one hour
     and not more than 8 hours on a regular basis. The tour of duty is established, in writing, for
     all regular employees at least one administrative workweek in advance of the tour to be
     worked and will not be changed or adjusted solely to avoid the payment of premium pay or
     other benefits. If possible, the tour of duty is established for the same days of each week, for
     the same hours each day, and on consecutive days of the administrative workweek. As far as
     practical, the regular daily tour is set up in terms of whole hours. When fractional hours are
     required, the regular daily tour is scheduled in whole hour and quarter-hour multiples.
     Regular daily tours are not scheduled in less than quarter hour increments.
     1.8.4. Rotating Tour of Duty. A rotating tour of duty is a scheduled tour of duty that
     rotates on a regular basis between shifts, different hours of the day, or different days of the
     administrative workweek, without a change in guaranteed hours.
     1.8.5. Split Shift. A split shift is two or more work periods within the workday, excluding
     overtime, when the break between the work periods exceeds 1 hour. Employees who are
     required to work split shifts must be allowed to use the time off between their shifts as they
     wish. If an employee is required to remain on the premises or to be available for work that
     may occur during the break, the break, under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), must be
     counted as hours of work.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  21


  1.8.6. Workday. The workday shall be scheduled within a 24 hour period and may extend
  over two calendar days in succession (e.g., 6:00 p.m. Monday through 2:30 a.m. Tuesday).
  1.8.7. Rest Periods. Short compensable rest periods, for not more than 15 minutes during
  each four hours of continuous work may be granted if the manager believes such rest periods
  are necessary.
  1.8.8. Meal Periods. Regular meal or lunch periods are normally established at no less than
  30 minutes nor in excess of 1 hour and are not considered as time worked, except for the
  purpose of determining entitlement to night shift differential pay. If time off for meals is not
  feasible, an on-the-job (OTJ) meal period of 20 minutes or less may be authorized and
  included in the employee's regularly scheduled tour of duty. No employee will work more
  than six consecutive hours without a meal period.
  1.8.9. Make Ready and Cleanup Time. Incidental duties directly connected with
  performing a job, such as obtaining and replacing working tools or materials, undergoing
  inspections, donning or removing prescribed work uniforms, and similar tasks, in established
  tours of duty are a part of the job requirements. Work shifts are arranged so that time
  required for incidental duties are part of the regularly scheduled workday.
  1.8.10. Daylight Savings Time. A NAF employee working on a shift when daylight
  savings time goes into effect, or when the return to standard time occurs, is credited with the
  actual number of hours worked on that shift. For eligible employees, charge the hour lost as
  a result of the change, to annual leave or LWOP.
  1.8.11. Work Schedules. All employees have access to a posted schedule. Flexible
  employees may be subject to "on call" work in addition to hours posted on the schedule.
  Supervisors/managers may change work schedules by providing a minimum of 24-hours
  notice to the employee. Use the Air Force standard timekeeping system to create and post
  work schedules.
     1.8.11.1. Changes in Work Schedules. Changes in the work schedule that do not
     decrease an employee's guaranteed hours may be made with a minimum 24-hour notice.
     For example: If an employee normally works Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 0700 to
     1600, the supervisor may change the schedule to Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday,
     0700 to 1600, provided the employee is given at least the minimum 24hour notice.
  1.8.12. Guaranteed Hours. Employees must, at a minimum, be scheduled for their
  guaranteed hours. If a regular or flexible employee is not scheduled for his or her guaranteed
  number of hours, the schedule will be changed, providing at least a 24-hour notice, to make
  up for the hours not scheduled in the employee's guaranteed hours. If this is not done, and
  the employee works less hours than his or her guaranteed hours, he or she must be paid for
  the difference between hours actually worked and hours guaranteed.
     1.8.12.1. Increase in Guaranteed Hours. Increases in an employee's guaranteed hours
     may be made at any time by submitting an AF Form 2548, to the NAF-HR.
     1.8.12.2. Reduction in Guaranteed Hours. When a supervisor determines that less
     hours are required routinely each week, and the only way to accomplish this requirement
     is to reduce an employee's guaranteed hours, proper action will be taken to make the
     required changes. Guaranteed hours will not be reduced solely to avoid payment of
22                                                     AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


       benefits, or to provide more hours for other employees. These advance notification
       periods must be adhered to during normal, day-to-day operations. When emergency
       conditions exist, notification periods may be modified according to the provisions
       outlined in Chapter 6, para 6.6.2.5. A reduction in an employee's guaranteed hours that
       results in a change in employment category must be processed as a business based action
       (BBA) (for example, reducing a regular employee from 20 to 15 hours), according to the
       procedures in Chapter 6. A reduction in an employee's guaranteed hours that does not
       require a change in employment category (for example, reducing a regular employee
       from 40 to 35 hours) must be processed according to the following procedures:
           1.8.12.2.1. When a decrease in hours is necessary, the supervisor must provide the
           employee a written notice in advance of the action according to Figure 1.1.

           and the NAF-HR coordinates on the written notice.
           1.8.12.2.4. A copy of the memorandum, together with AF Form 2548, requesting the
           change in the guaranteed hours, is sent to the NAF-HR. The NAF-HR processes the
           form and issues an AF Form 2545, to effect the change.
       1.8.12.3. Reduction in Guaranteed Hours at Employee's Request. A decrease in
       guaranteed hours at the employee's request that does not reduce the employment
       category, may be taken at anytime, provided the employee submits the request in writing
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  23

  amendment added NAF employees to the group of employees who are covered by P.L. 97-
  221, Federal Employees’ Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act of 1982, thereby
  removing them from the basic overtime requirements imposed by FLSA and 5 U.S.C. for the

            1.8.14.3.5.3. Complete and sign a safety checklist that proclaims their home safe
            for an official home worksite. The goal is to ensure that all requirements to do
            official work are met in an environment that allows the tasks to be performed
            safely.
            1.8.14.3.5.4. Ensure that a proper work environment is maintained in instances
            where the home is the alternative worksite (e.g. dependent care arrangements are
            maintained and do not interfere with the home office, personal disruptions such as
            non-business telephone calls and visitors are kept to a minimum). Telework is not
            a substitute for dependent care.
            1.8.14.3.5.5. Must have a written telework agreement (regardless of whether
            telework is regular and recurring, or situational). The agreement is mandatory in
            order for any employee to participate in telework.
        1.8.14.3.6. FSS NAF-Human Resources Section shall:
            1.8.14.3.6.1. Ensure supervisors and participants adhere to all policies and
            procedures.
            1.8.14.3.6.2. Provide appropriate notification to local labor organizations and
            ensure labor relations obligations are completed prior to local implementation of
            the telework program.
            1.8.14.3.6.3. Serves as an advisor for installation leadership.
            1.8.14.3.6.4. Serves as a resource for managers and employees on telework
            matters.
            1.8.14.3.6.5. Track employee participation and provide usage             data to
            AFSVA/SVXHR at the end of each calendar year.
            1.8.14.3.6.6. Distribute information on telework throughout the workplace and
            include in periodic training events.
            1.8.14.3.6.7. Brief new employees occupying telework eligible positions to
            ensure they are aware of their telework responsibilities, should telework be
            offered or requested.
     1.8.14.4. Telework Applicability. Telework is an effective strategy for mission
     accomplishment, ensuring continuity of operations (COOP) in a crisis, and recruiting and
     retaining valued talent. Telework for applicable NAF jobs can be used:
        1.8.14.4.1. On a regular and recurring basis.
        1.8.14.4.2. On a situational, non-routine, or ad hoc basis:
            1.8.14.4.2.1. To perform large projects or tasks that requires concentration and
            uninterrupted blocks of time for successful completion.
            1.8.14.4.2.2. For supervisor or commander directed Web-based distance and
            continuous learning, including educational requirements required by law or
            regulation. Training requested by an employee is subject to the supervisor’s or
            commander’s approval, as applicable, and must conform to the provisions of
            applicable regulations.
28                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


            1.8.14.4.2.3. When the traditional worksite is closed during adverse or inclement
            weather conditions (e.g., snow emergencies, floods, hurricanes).
        1.8.14.4.3. As a regular, situational, or ad hoc arrangement for employees with
        impairments, as appropriate. The DoD Computer/Electronic Accommodations
        Program may provide services and accommodations (e.g., assistive devices and
        technology) for employees with impairments teleworking under an approved telework
        arrangement. In the case of covered employees, telework arrangements may be a
        form of reasonable accommodation pursuant to sections 791 and 794a of title 29,
        United States Code (U.S.C.) (also known as ―The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as
        amended‖). The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, does not apply to military
        personnel.
        1.8.14.4.4. Periodically (as practice) to prepare for COOP and an efficient transition
        to telework in the event of an emergency situation.
     1.8.14.5. Telework Eligibility. To the extent that mission requirements and customer
     service are not jeopardized or diminished, the commander may permit employees to
     telework who exhibit suitable work performance and occupy eligible positions (i.e., those
     positions that involve portable work and are not dependent on the employee’s presence at
     the traditional worksite or face-to-face interaction with customers) to the extent possible.
        1.8.14.5.1. To be able to participate in telework, an employee must first be identified
        as eligible. The Telework Act specifies two categories of employees who may not be
        deemed eligible under any circumstances: an employee who "has been officially
        disciplined for being absent without permission for more than 5 days in any calendar
        year‖ and an employee who ―has been officially disciplined for violations of subpart
        G of the Standards of Ethical Conduct of Employees of the Executive Branch for
        reviewing, downloading, or exchanging pornography, including child pornography,
        on a Federal Government computer or while performing official Federal Government
        duties [Public Law 111-292, 6502(a)(2)(A)(B)]." The term ―official discipline‖
        should be understood as a disciplinary action that results in the placement of a
        document in an employee’s official personnel file (OPF). Specific determinations for
        eligibility are left to the discretion of the FSS Commander/Director.
        1.8.14.5.2. Telework eligibility criteria should be applied impartially and
        consistently. Supervisors or commanders should allow flexibility for employees to
        telework to the extent that mission readiness or accomplishment and customer service
        is not compromised. Regular, routine use of telework programs will allow
        supervisors, and employees to identify and resolve technology, equipment,
        communications, workflow, and associated issues that could impact the efficiency of
        mission accomplishment and inhibit the transparency of remote work.
        1.8.14.5.3. Telework is a discretionary workplace flexibility. Employees cannot be
        ordered to telework, unless the employee’s duties are designated as mission-critical or
        the employee’s telework agreement addresses this requirement. Telework is not an
        entitlement and not all employees are eligible to telework. Although there may be
        circumstances when employees in these positions may be considered for telework on
        a situational basis, employees in the following types of positions are typically not
        eligible for telework:
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 29


           1.8.14.5.3.1. Employees in positions that require, on a daily basis, an on-site
           activity or face-to-face personal contacts that cannot be handled remotely or at an
           alternate workplace (e.g., hands-on contact with machinery, equipment, or
           vehicles).
           1.8.14.5.3.2. Employees whose performance or conduct warrants more close
           supervisory direction than telework may provide, whose rating of record is below
           fully successful (or its equivalent), whose conduct has resulted in disciplinary
           action within the past 12 months, or who have unresolved security issues.
           1.8.14.5.3.3. Employees recently assigned or newly appointed to trainee or entry
           level positions.
           1.8.14.5.3.4. The length of time for which the employee is deemed ineligible for
           telework is at the commander’s/director’s discretion and should be based upon
           criteria identified and addressed in this guidance (e.g., the employee’s
           performance within the first 6 months in the position or at mid-term review is at
           an acceptable level).
           1.8.14.5.3.5. Management is encouraged to review all positions for determining
           telework eligibility based on the criteria in this guidance.
     1.8.14.6. Telework Requirements.
        1.8.14.6.1. Telework Agreements.
           1.8.14.6.1.1. All employees who telework on a regular and recurring basis or
           situational basis must complete a DD Form 2946. The DD Form 2946 shall be
           signed and dated by the employee and supervisor and maintained by the
           employee’s supervisor. Completed DD Form 2946s should address the logistics
           of alternate workplace arrangements such as the employee’s work schedule,
           security requirements for DoD information, safety requirements for alternate
           workplace, supplies and equipment used, the supervisor’s expectations of a
           teleworker’s performance, and the employee’s emergency response telework
           responsibilities.   All telework agreements, regardless of the employee’s
           emergency response status, should address:
               1.8.14.6.1.1.1. The employee’s telework location (e.g., the employee’s home
               or other approved alternate workplace such as a telework center, when
               appropriate).
               1.8.14.6.1.1.2. Whether the employee will telework when the traditional
               worksite is closed (e.g., emergency dismissal due to adverse weather
               conditions such as snow emergencies, floods, hurricanes, or any other type of
               emergency situation).
        1.8.14.6.1.2. If the employee’s home is the telework location, it is the responsibility
        of the employee to make certain that a safe work environment is maintained while
        teleworking. Employees should designate one section of the home as the telework
        work station for purposes of the telework agreement and complete and sign a self-
        certification safety checklist as part of the initial submittal of the DD Form 2946 prior
        to beginning the telework arrangement.
30                                                AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


        1.8.14.6.1.3. Telework agreements shall be reviewed by the supervisor and
        teleworker, re-validated at least every 2 years, and revised when appropriate. A
        new DD Form 2946 should be completed when a new relationship is established
        between the employee and their supervisor.
        1.8.14.6.1.4. Teleworkers may be required to return to the traditional worksite on
        scheduled telework days based on operational requirements. A recall to the office
        for operational reasons is not a termination of the telework agreement. Requests
        by teleworkers to change their scheduled telework day(s) in a particular week or
        biweekly pay period should be accommodated by the supervisor where
        practicable and consistent with mission requirements. A permanent change of the
        telework agreement must be reflected by approval of a new DD Form 2946.
     1.8.14.6.2. Official Worksite. Designation of the official worksite shall be
     established for an employee on an approved regular telework schedule on a case-by-
     case basis consistent with the guidance set forth in section 531.605 of title 5, Code of
     Federal Regulations. The official worksite for an employee covered by a telework
     agreement is the location of the traditional worksite for the employee’s position (i.e.,
     the place where the employee would normally work absent a telework agreement), as
     long as the employee is scheduled to report physically at least twice each biweekly
     pay period on a regular and recurring basis to the traditional worksite.
     1.8.14.6.3. Security Considerations. Employees are responsible for safeguarding all
     DoD information, protecting government furnished equipment and government
     property, and performing assigned duties while teleworking in support of mission
     requirements. Employees who telework from home must comply with criteria and
     guidelines established by the installation for keeping Government property and
     information safe and secure. Restrictions may apply to employees located outside the
     continental United States (OCONUS).
     1.8.14.6.4. Equipment and Office Supplies. Installations may provide the necessary
     equipment and office supplies (e.g. paper, toner, and printer ink) for use by
     employees who telework on a regular and recurring basis, within budgetary
     constraints, based on the nature and type of work performed. Coordination with the
     Installation Comptroller and/or Resource Manager (in the case of Nonappropriated
     Funds) is required to determine availability of funds for telework equipment.
     Equipment and supplies may be furnished for employees who telework on a
     situational or ad hoc basis upon availability of funds. Employees must comply with
     equipment usage requirements set forth in the telework agreement. Installations may
     provide funding to install telephone lines, broadband, or other necessary
     telecommunications equipment in a private residence for employees that telework on
     a regular and recurring basis. The Air Force is not responsible for any operating costs
     associated with employee's personal equipment and residence at alternative worksites.
     This includes maintenance, insurance, and utilities.
     1.8.14.6.5. Emergency Situations. Employees who perform mission-critical duties
     may be required to work from home or an alternate workplace such as a telework
     center during an emergency situation. Installations are strongly encouraged to have
     these employees complete a DD Form 2946. The telework agreement should address
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                            31


       the telework location and work expectations. To the extent practicable, supervisors
       will include a description of emergency duties with the telework agreement if
       emergency duties are different from the employee’s normal duties. In the event of a
       pandemic health crisis, employees with COOP responsibilities may be asked to
       telework to prevent the spread of germs. These employees should telework on a
       regular basis to ensure their proficiency and telework’s effectiveness in continuing
       operations. Employees in positions not typically eligible for telework should
       telework on a situational basis when feasible. Employees who may be required to
       telework in the event of a pandemic should have a signed DD Form 2946 in place.
          1.8.14.6.5.1. Employees approved for regular and situational telework who are
          not able to report to their assigned office location due to office closure or
          dismissal from a natural or man-made emergency event (e.g., hurricane,
          earthquake, wild fire, snow storm, flooding, act of terrorism) shall continue to
          telework each regularly scheduled work day during the emergency situation.
          Designated employees who are unable to work due to injury or illness or
          dependent care responsibilities will request leave appropriate for those
          circumstances. If circumstances permitting excused absence for other non-
          teleworking employees also prevent the teleworker from working at the telework
          location (e.g., loss of electrical power; evacuation by local authorities; or the
          employee cannot access materials necessary to continue work during the
          emergency), the employee shall attempt to contact a supervisor to be excused
          from duty. Supervisors may administratively excuse the designated teleworker
          from teleworking on a case-by-case basis. If the teleworker is unable to
          communicate with their supervisor to be excused from duty and cannot maintain
          their remote working status, the teleworker should follow the installation’s
          emergency guidance, orders, and procedures (e.g., outlined in COOP and other
          applicable emergency management plans). Any requirement that a teleworker
          continue to work if the installation closes or dismisses employees early should be
          included in the employee’s DD Form 2946.
          1.8.14.6.5.2. When an employee’s residence or other approved alternate
          workplace has been designated as a safe haven during an emergency, such as a
          pandemic health crisis evacuation, the supervisor may assign any work necessary,
          as long as the employee has the skills to perform the assigned work, without
          regard to the employee’s grade or pay band level. In cases where a safe haven is
          designated, a DD Form 2946 does not need to be in place.
          1.8.14.6.5.3. Employees designated as mission-critical should telework on a
          regular basis to ensure their proficiency and telework’s effectiveness in
          continuing operations in the event of an emergency or pandemic. Mission-critical
          employees in positions not typically eligible for telework should telework on a
          situational basis, when feasible. Such employees should have a signed DD Form
          2946 in place.
       1.8.14.6.6. Work Schedules and Compensation. Employees who telework must be at
       their alternate worksite during their scheduled tours of duty. Employees may not use
       telework as a substitute for dependent care, e.g., child or elder care. Employees who
       telework may also have alternate work schedules at the discretion of the supervisor.
32                                               AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


     Employees may work part of the day at their approved alternate worksite and part of
     the day at the traditional worksite to accommodate work schedules and personal
     commitments (e.g., to attend a training course or a medical appointment located near
     the employee’s alternate worksite prior to reporting to the traditional worksite).
     Premium pay provisions that apply to work at the traditional worksite also apply to
     employees who telework. Employees may work overtime only when specifically
     ordered and approved in advance by the supervisor. Instances in which employees
     perform overtime work without prior supervisory approval may be cause for
     administrative or disciplinary action.
     1.8.14.6.7. Time and Attendance. Time spent in a telework status must be accounted
     for and reported in the same manner as if the employee reported for work at the
     traditional worksite. Supervisors should establish appropriate procedures for
     documenting hours of work and approved leave for teleworkers to ensure telework
     hours are appropriately coded as regular and recurring, situational, or medical.
     Employees must record dates of telework accomplished so installation telework usage
     can be tracked.
     1.8.14.6.8. Telework Training. Employees participating in telework should take
     telework training prior to teleworking. Supervisors should also take part in telework
     training. Comprehensive OPM telework training courses for supervisors and
     employees are available at the joint OPM/GSA telework website,
     http://www.telework.gov/tools_and_resources/training/index.aspx.           Employees,
     supervisors, and leaders shall be permitted to participate in telework training during
     the work day.
     1.8.14.6.9. Performance Management. Performance standards for employees that
     telework should be the same as performance standards for on-site employees. As
     with any supervisory relationship, work assignments to be performed or training to be
     accomplished while on telework should be agreed to, and understood, in advance of
     the telework event. Supervisor expectations of an employees’ performance should be
     clearly addressed in the DD Form 2946. As with on-site personnel, employees shall
     be held accountable for the results they produce while teleworking. Supervisors shall
     communicate expectations of telework arrangements, including work assignments,
     office coverage, and staff communication to teleworking and non-teleworking
     employees in the workgroup.
     1.8.14.6.10. Telework Denial and Termination. A telework request may be denied
     by the supervisor. A telework agreement may be terminated at the discretion of the
     supervisor or at the employee’s request. When an employee’s request to telework is
     denied or an agreement is terminated by the supervisor, the reasons for denial or
     termination should be documented in writing and given to the employee. Denial or
     termination of telework agreements should be based on business reasons (e.g., the
     telework agreement fails to meet the organization’s needs or the employee’s
     performance does not meet the prescribed standard). Employees may dispute the
     denial of telework, the reasons given for a denial, and the termination of an existing
     telework agreement through the negotiated grievance procedures or administrative
     procedures per AFMAN 34-310, as applicable.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              33


          1.8.14.6.11. Workers’ Compensation and Other Liabilities. The Government is not
          liable for damages to the employee’s personal or real property while the employee is
          working at the approved alternative worksite, except to the extent the Government is
          held liable by the Federal Tort Claims Act. The employee is covered by the
          Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act (LHWCA) when injured or
          suffering from work-related illnesses while conducting official Government business.
          The employee agrees to notify the supervisor immediately of any accident or injury
          that occurs at the alternative worksite while performing official duties and to
          complete any required forms.
1.9. NAF-HR Staffing Guide. Figure 1.2 prescribes the recommended number of NAF
authorizations in the NAF-HR. This figure is a guide for planning staffing requirements. It is
not a manpower standard for NAF-HRs. Actual staffing requirements are approved by the FSS
Commander/Director locally based on workload and resources needed to accomplish the
mission.

2.4. Employee Medical Folder (EMF). The EMF contains occupationally related civilian
employee medical records created during an individual's employment. Normally, such records
are maintained by medical facilities under the control of a medical officer. The EMF is created
and maintained for any records that are not maintained by the medical facility.
2.5. Merged Records Personnel Folder (MRPF). The MRPF contains the personnel records
of employees moving between NAF and civil service within DoD, who are covered by
portability benefits. Once an MRPF is established for an employee, use the folder to retain the
employee's records in all subsequent NAF and civil service employment. The ownership,
maintenance, and retention of MRPFs is according to the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) between the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the National Archives and
Records Administration, and the DoD NAF Employment System, 7 Aug 1992.
2.6. Disposition of Personnel Records and Folders. Dispose of personnel records and folders
according to the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) at:
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm
     2.6.1. Use SF-127, Request for Official Personnel Folder, to request the personnel folder of
     employees with prior federal employment. Forward requests to the National Personnel
     Records Center (NPRC), or to the servicing personnel office (must be within DoD), if the
     folders have not yet been forwarded to the NPRC.
     2.6.2. Prior to transferring the personnel folder of a NAF employee to the NPRC, or to
     another servicing personnel office within DoD, NAF-HRs attach a statement to the folder
     instructing that NAF records may not be purged from the folder without the approval of HQ
     AFSVA/SVXH.
2.7. Supervisor's Records. Supervisors must have access to certain types of information
regarding the employees they supervise. The NAF-HR provides employee information
contained in the OPF and DCPDS, and provides instructions for the upkeep and use of the
information. Supervisors use the information provided by the NAF-HR to carry out their
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                    39


supervisory responsibilities, and to document significant events and discussions concerning
employee performance, recognition, and conduct. Managers and supervisors maintain employee
records according to AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records.
   2.7.1. Supervisor's Employee Work Folder. Use a six-part folder to maintain employee
   documentation. It consists of specific job-related documentation generated throughout the
   course of the employee's employment. Each first-level supervisor maintains the employee
   folders in a secured place. Maintenance of and access to the folders by administrative or
   clerical personnel who are not the first-level supervisor is prohibited. Supervisors at higher
   levels will not maintain duplicate sets of records. In the absence of the first level supervisor,
   the next higher-level supervisor may have access to those records. The Employee Work
   Folder will be maintained in the following order:
   Part I, PD and PG

   Part II, AF Form 971, Supervisor's Employee Brief (computer generated)

   Part III, Pending personnel action documents

   Part IV, Employee recognition, awards, and performance evaluations

   Part V, Employee education and training

   Part VI, Miscellaneous information, i.e., debt letters, leave schedules, health cards, etc.
   2.7.2. Safeguarding Records. All supervisors maintaining these records must be cautioned
   they are to use discretion when asked to furnish them, and they may be furnished only as
   authorized by the Privacy Act. Request guidance from the NAF-HR for requests of release
   of information in these records. Protect employee work folders from unauthorized access.
   2.7.3. Disposition of Employee Work Folders. Use the following procedures to dispose of
   the supervisor's employee work folder:
       2.7.3.1. Retain the employee work folder for the new supervisor when a supervisor
       leaves the organization.
       2.7.3.2. The losing supervisor sends the employee work folder to the gaining supervisor
       in a sealed envelope within ten workdays when an employee moves to a different activity
       on the same installation.
       2.7.3.3. Destroy the employee work folder after 60 days when an employee is transferred
       to another AF installation or another agency.
       2.7.3.4. The supervisor destroys the employee work folder after 60 days when an
       employee is separated for any reason other than for entrance into military service
       (military furlough) or for any type of adverse action (BBA, performance, or cause).
          2.7.3.4.1. When an employee is separated as a result of an adverse action, forward
          the employee work folder to the NAF-HR pending possible appeal, grievance, Equal
          Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaints, or unfair labor practice (ULP) charges.
40                                                   AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


          Upon resolution of any of the above charges, the employee work folder may be
          destroyed.
          2.7.3.4.2. The supervisor sends the employee work folder to the NAF-HR, who
          retains the folder with the OPF, pending the expiration of the period of military
          furlough when an employee is separated to enter the military service (military
          furlough).
2.8. Disclosure of Information in Personnel Folders. The Privacy Act gives employees the
right to know what personnel records are collected, maintained, and disseminated by the AF and
the right to correct and amend their personnel records. DoD Regulation 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-
302, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program, and AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program,
apply when releasing information and documents in employee's personnel folders, when
amending or correcting those records, and when determining fees to be charged for furnishing
such records. Disclosure of any information in an employee's personnel folder is the
responsibility of the servicing NAF-HR.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                     41

   qualifications, character, loyalty, or suitability of such individual.
   3.2.3. Coerce the political activity of any person (including the providing of any political
   contribution or service), or take any action against any employee or applicant for

   to any employee or applicant for employment because of any lawful disclosure of
   information by an employee or applicant for employment which the employee or applicant
   for employment reasonably believes evidences a violation of any law, rule, or regulation,
   mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific
   danger to public health or safety.
   3.2.9. Take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, any personnel action against any
   employee or applicant for employment because of:

     appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, any individual who is a relative, in a
     civilian position in the NAFI in which he or she is serving, or over which he or she exercises

   is not entitled to pay and any payments to the individual made in violation of this policy will
   be recovered by the employing NAFI in accordance with AFI 34-202, Protecting
   Nonappropriated Fund Assets.
   3.4.5. When necessary to meet urgent needs resulting from an emergency posing an
   immediate threat to life or property, or a national emergency, an official may employ a
   relative to meet those needs without regard to this policy. However, such employment at
   installation level requires justification to and approval of the MAJCOM Chief of Services
   (A1S); and such employment at MAJCOM or at AFSVA level requires justification to and
   approval of Director of Services (HQ USAF/A1S), Deputy Chief of Staff, Manpower,
   Personnel and Services. In either case, such employment is limited to thirty calendar days
   without justification from employing official and approval of HQ USAF/A1S.
   3.4.6. This policy shall not be construed to prohibit the appointment of an individual who is
   a preference eligible in any case in which the passing over of that individual will result in the
   selection for appointment of an individual who is not a preference eligible.
   3.4.7. Relatives are not prohibited from working in the same NAFI; however, such
   employment is prohibited if it results in a conflict of interest situation. Such employment
   may also be prohibited for other reasons, which may be disruptive to work, and interfere with
   the orderly operation of the NAFI. Give consideration to how the employer/employee
   relationship will be perceived by the work force, as well as the general public.
3.5. Employment of Minors. The employment of persons under 16 years of age is prohibited.
The employment of persons ages 16 and 17 must be in accordance with the following:
   3.5.1. The FLSA, federal, state, and local laws that relate to the employment of minors.
   3.5.2. Must not be employed in a position requiring the operation of a motor vehicle, unless
   the minor employee is eligible to obtain a U.S. Government operator's permit and possess a
   valid state driver's license, where required.
   3.5.3. Must furnish a work permit when required by local or state law.
3.6. Employment of People with Disabilities. Give full consideration to employing and
selectively placing people with disabilities in NAF organizations. The employment and
promotion of these persons is based solely on their ability to satisfactorily perform the duties of
the position.
3.7. Employment of Retired U. S. Military Personnel:
   3.7.1. Restrictions. Retired members of the Armed Forces shall be afforded the same rights
   and considerations as all other applicants for civilian employment in NAFIs. However, their
   employment shall be subject to the restrictions imposed by Title 5 U.S.C. 3326, 5531 and
   DoD Instruction 1402.1, Employment of Retired Members of the Armed Forces, 21 Jan 82.
   Most notably, these restrictions apply to the timing of an appointment.
44                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


        3.7.1.1. Avoid the practice and appearance of preferential treatment. This is essential not
        only in the interest of the public and federal employees, but also to protect such retired
        personnel from unwarranted allegations that they obtained their positions through
        influence based on prior military service.
        3.7.1.2. Make every reasonable effort to locate other qualified candidates before
        appointing a retired member of the military services to a NAF position to avoid the
        appearance of preferential treatment.
        3.7.1.3. Do not hold positions open pending the retirement of a member of the military
        services to provide that person with a preferential opportunity to apply for the position.
        3.7.1.4. If the position was last occupied by the proposed appointee or another military
        incumbent, clearly demonstrate that the proposed change to civilian incumbency is to
        meet a management need and not for the purpose of affording civilian employment to the
        proposed appointee.
     3.7.2. Timing. Appointments or transfers of retired members of the Armed Forces to
     positions in any DoD Component during the 180 days immediately following retirement may
     be made only when one of these conditions is met:
        3.7.2.1. The appointment is to a position for which the minimum rate of basic
        compensation has been increased in accordance with section 5305 of title 5, United States
        Code;
        3.7.2.2. A state of national emergency exists; or
        3.7.2.3. The proposed appointment is approved by the installation commander and the
        appointment is to a position for which:
           3.7.2.3.1. Candidates are not available for consideration through the DoD Priority
           Placement Program, the Reemployment Priority List, and the Interagency Career
           Transition Assistance Plan for Displaced Employees, as described in part 330 of title
           5, Code of Federal Regulations (Reference (f)); and
           3.7.2.3.2. More highly qualified personnel are not available among the employees
           being considered.
        3.7.2.4. Each appointment of a retired member of the Armed Forces during the 180-day
        period following retirement from active duty must comply with the spirit and intent of the
        law and this Instruction. Appointments made pursuant to section 3326(b) (1) of title 5,
        United States Code must be fully documented unless the criteria in subparagraphs 3.7.2.1
        or 3.7.2.2 apply. Documentation shall include the following information, at a minimum,
        and shall be retained for 2 years from the date of appointment.
           3.7.2.4.1. The effective date (YYMMDD) of retirement from the Armed Forces.
           3.7.2.4.2. The rank at the time of retirement.
           3.7.2.4.3. The pay grade and Armed Force at the time of retirement.

          3.7.2.4.6. The date (YYMMDD) the position was last occupied.
          3.7.2.4.7. Whether the position was converted from military to civilian status.

          3.7.2.4.9. The reason for conversion.
          3.7.2.4.10. Whether the proposed appointee was the last military occupant.
          3.7.2.4.11. A current position description.
          3.7.2.4.12. Whether the position is permanent, term, or temporary.
          3.7.2.4.13. The qualification requirements and any selective placement factors used
          to qualify applicants for the position.
          3.7.2.4.14. A statement that efforts to fill the position have been continuous since it
          became vacant and, if not, the reasons for the delay in recruitment.
          3.7.2.4.15. Include the commander's approval or disapproval of each request for
          appointment under paragraph 3.7.2 in the return correspondence. Place a copy of the
          approval correspondence on the right-hand side of the employee's OPF.
3.8. Employment of ODM Personnel. Subject to the provisions of DoD Directive 5500.7,
Joint Ethics Regulation, 29 Nov 07, and if there is no preferential treatment in the selection
process, U.S. enlisted personnel may be hired as NAF employees during their non-duty hours, on
less than a full-time basis.
   3.8.1. Off-duty enlisted personnel employed as regular employees (20-34) hours may qualify
   for benefits earned by other regular employees. However, they are not eligible for group
   health insurance, workers' compensation, or retirement.
   3.8.2. Off-duty enlisted personnel may not work more than 34 hours a week under any
   circumstances.
   3.8.3. Active duty commissioned and warrant officers are prohibited from NAF
   employment, except under an individual services contract.
   3.8.4. When hiring off-duty enlisted personnel assigned to FSS or Services organization as
   their prime military duty, these additional rules apply:
       3.8.4.1. These enlisted personnel must not be hired to perform duties in the same FSS
       activity to which assigned while carrying out their assigned military duties.
       3.8.4.2. The selecting official must prepare a written certification to show there is no
       violation of DoDD 5500.7, and there was no preferential treatment in the selection
       process. The certification is sent to the NAF-HR and filed in the OPF.
   3.8.5. Active duty military members who are retiring from military service may continue
   their NAF employment if the employee is currently on the rolls of the employing NAFI at the
   time of retirement; and agrees, in writing there will be no change in his or her employment
   status (e.g., employment category or position) during the 180-day period following
   retirement.
       3.8.5.1. While on terminal leave, pending their retirement from active duty, these
       employees may be scheduled to work up to 40 hours per week.

3.9. Military Spouse Preference (MSP). Preference for employment shall be provided in
accordance with DoD Instruction 1400.25-V315. The term ―active duty‖ includes full-time
members of the Reserves or National Guard.
     3.9.1. The spouse of an active duty member of the Armed Forces (including the U.S. Coast
     Guard and full-time Reserve or National Guard), who relocates via a PCS move to the
     military sponsor’s new permanent duty station, is entitled to MSP for positions in the
     commuting area of the new duty station if he or she:
        3.9.1.1. Married the military sponsor prior to his or her reporting date to the new
        geographic area;
        3.9.1.2. Meets all pre-employment criteria and is immediately appointable under the
        applicable recruitment procedures;
        3.9.1.3. Meets basic qualifications and is among the best qualified for the position;
        3.9.1.4. Furnishes a copy of the Permanent Change of Station (PCS) order identifying the
        sponsor’s reporting date to the new duty location;
        3.9.1.5. Submits a current application or resume or automated resume; and
        3.9.1.6. For spouses with current or prior Federal service, submits a copy of the most
        recent performance appraisal rating and, if applicable, documentation of appointment
        eligibility under Executive Order 12721, ―Eligibility of Overseas Employees for
        Noncompetitive Appointments,‖ July 30, 1990.
     3.9.2. Except as provided in para 3.9.3.4 the time period for MSP eligibility begins 30 days
     before the military sponsor’s reporting date to the new duty station, if accompanied, or at any
     time thereafter during the tour. Eligible spouses retain preference for the duration of the
     sponsor’s tour unless preference terminates sooner under 3.9.4. Military spouse preference
     does not apply when the military member sponsor's move is a PCS in conjunction with
     retirement or separation.
     3.9.3. Military spouse preference will remain intact until used; however, spouses of military
     sponsors who are within 6 months of their tour rotation date may be nonselected for
     permanent (continuing) positions without regard to preference. There is no limit to the
     number of times MSP may be applied to referral and selection for non-continuing positions.
     Spouses may be simultaneously referred for continuing and non-continuing positions, until
     such time as eligibility is lost due to acceptance or declination of an offer of a continuing
     position. However, upon acceptance of a non-continuing position (flexible NTE or regular
     NTE), the spouse’s eligibility for preference for other non-continuing positions will be
     suspended until 60 days prior to the expiration of the non-continuing position. Continuing
     positions are defined as positions to which appointments are made without time limitation,
     and which are required to have a fixed work schedule, i.e., part-time or full-time. Non-
     continuing positions:
        3.9.3.1. Any temporary position, regardless of work schedule.
        3.9.3.2. Permanent positions with an intermittent work schedule, e.g., substitute teaching
        positions with DoD Dependents Schools.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 47


     3.9.3.3. AF positions with a ―flexible‖ work schedule, or any NAF position for which the
     employment category is identified as ―flexible.‖
     3.9.3.4. Spouses who do not initially relocate with their sponsors are not eligible for
     preference until they are actually residing in the commuting area of the new duty station.
  3.9.4. Spouse preference eligibility is terminated upon:
     3.9.4.1. Acceptance or refusal of a continuing position in the Federal Service for which
     the spouse has registered or applied for employment, whether or not preference was
     applied;
     3.9.4.2. Refusal to participate in established recruitment procedures (e.g., interview,
     responding to evaluation criteria);
     3.9.4.3. Loss of MSP status due to divorce, death of the sponsor, or sponsor’s retirement
     or separation from active duty.
  3.9.5. Military spouses may apply for any position in all employment categories in pay band
  NFIII and below, CY positions, and equivalent hourly paid crafts and trades positions.
  However, preference applies only when the grade/pay band for which the spouse has applied
  is no higher than that previously held in the federal service. On initial appointment in the
  federal service, military spouse preference applies to all positions in pay bands NFI NFIII,
  CY positions, and equivalent hourly-paid crafts and trades positions for which qualified. A
  qualified military spouse exercising preference for NAF employment will receive preference
  over a nonpreference eligible spouse.
  3.9.6. A list of NAF positions must be available for spouses seeking employment. Spouse
  preference eligibles apply by submitting to the NAF-HR an application for NAF
  employment; a copy of the sponsor's PCS orders and, a copy of the commander's document
  granting command sponsorship to the military spouse, if applicable.
     3.9.6.1. Verification of military spouse preference eligibility is the responsibility of the
     NAF-HR. The application for NAF employment must be annotated with the military
     spouse preference eligibility. The application for NAF employment along with
     documentation verifying spouse preference will be made a part of the employee's official
     record when appointed, because of exercising military spouse preference entitlement.
  3.9.7. Spouses eligible for preference must be included as part of the minimum consideration
  area in the competitive process. The selecting supervisor reviews all applications for the
  position and, based on an evaluation of each application, decides which applicants are best
  qualified. Normally, a best-qualified determination is not made for entry level and other
  lower graded positions where relative distinctions are rarely discernible. In foreign areas,
  off-duty military members and military spouses are given equitable consideration for part-
  time employment. If, however, selection is made from a group of competitive candidates, the
  military spouse preference eligible must be selected, without regard to other priorities, if
  among the best qualified.
  3.9.8. Exception may be made to the selection of a military spouse preference eligible. The
  authority to approve such an exception is delegated to the installation commander where
  application is made. A request for exception must be justified in writing, and the granting of
  the exception shall be rare and based on adverse impact to the mission.

     3.9.9. Placements of military spouses under this policy shall be documented by having the
     remark "Military Spouse Appointed Under E.O. 12568," in item 25 of the AF Form 2545.
3.10. Transition Hiring Preference (THP):
     3.10.1. Public Law 101-510, The 1991 National Defense Authorization Act, mandates the
     services provide certain categories of involuntarily separated military members, and in some
     cases, their family members, benefits and services to ease the transition process from military
     to civilian life. AF NAFI’s role in implementing the act will be to administer THP by
     providing employment preference for certain NAF positions for eligible members and their
     family members.
     3.10.2. Eligible THP applicants will possess a transition assistance identification card. This
     will give them hiring preference over all other applicants, with the exception of military
     spouse preference applicants.
     3.10.3. Preference may be used for any NAF job open to competition according to merit
     practices, at CY, NFIII and below and crafts and trades positions. This applies even if there
     are enough in-house eligibles to limit competition just to them under merit procedures.
     Preference will not be limited to just those vacancies where it is necessary to hire outside the
     organization. The following rules apply:
        3.10.3.1. A person may receive THP in hiring only once.
        3.10.3.2. THP eligibles must apply for employment and be fully qualified.
        3.10.3.3. Qualified THP applicants will be referred for selection only if among the best-
        qualified candidates after being competitively screened.
        3.10.3.4. THP is terminated upon placement in, or declination of, any NAF position
        (whichever occurs first) for which a THP-eligible has applied.
     3.10.4. Placements of THP applicants will be documented by the remark "THP Appointment
     Under P.L. 101510," in item 25 of the AF Form 2545.
3.11. NAF Employment in Foreign Areas. Overseas NAFIs may locally recruit U.S. citizens
and U.S. nationals residing in the host country according to established country-to-country
agreements. Except in those instances where placement must be made under the provisions of
paragraphs 3.9, 3.10, and 6.7, first priority must be given to the employment of dependents of
military and civilian personnel assigned in the host country, without regard to other priorities in
this document and to off-duty military personnel, when such actions are not at variance with the
Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA), treaties or country-to-country agreements.
3.12. Entitlements and Benefits of Overseas Service. See Chapter 16.
3.13. Dual Compensation and Dual Employment:
     3.13.1. Title 5 U.S.C., Section 5533(a), states that a civilian employee will not be entitled to
     receive basic compensation from more than one civilian office or position of the Government
     of the U.S. for more than an aggregate of 40 hours of work in any one calendar week
     (Sunday through Saturday). The intent of the law is generally to prohibit an individual from
     holding more than one fulltime government position.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                    49


   3.13.2. A part-time employee may be employed in another position as long as the total hours
   worked in all jobs do not exceed 40 hours per week. Employees may be employed in a
   regular and a flexible position, or in two flexible positions, however, they may not be
   employed in two regular positions.
   3.13.3. This restriction applies to all positions within the U.S. Government, including APF
   and AAFES positions. Employment with the U.S. Postal Service does not fall under these
   dual compensation restrictions.
   3.13.4. This also applies to foreign nationals employed and paid by a NAF organization in a
   foreign area.
3.14. Reinstatement:
   3.14.1. This is the reemployment of a former DoD NAFI Regular employee who separated
   from NAFI employment. Any NAFI may reinstate the former employee any time after the
   date of the separation. A reinstatement may be noncompetitive when to the same or lower
   grade or pay band level previously held with a DoD NAFI. Such personnel are considered to
   have been in continuous service in a LWOP status for the purpose of retaining benefits other
   than grade or pay retention, retirement, and group life and health insurance benefits.
   3.14.2. Regular employees who have left NAF employment to fill a like APF position in the
   same NAFI, and have continually served in the APF position since appointment may be
   reinstated by any DoD NAFI indefinitely. Such personnel must be considered to have been
   in continuous service for the purpose of retaining benefits other than grade or pay retention,
   retirement, and group life and health insurance.
   3.14.3. An individual suspended or removed for reasons of national security may be restored
   to duty only at the discretion of the Secretary of the AF.
3.15. Individual Services Contracts. NAFI individual services contracts are authorized only
when there is no employer-employee relationship, such as sports officials, and instructors in
educational, recreational, religious, and entertainment activities. They may not be used to effect
an appointment to a position that requires employing an individual on a continuing basis. Such
positions must be classified and paid under the appropriate pay schedule. Individual Services
Contracts are not used to provide services that an individual is obligated to provide the NAFI as
a result of his or her military or civilian employee position. Individual Services Contracts are not
to be used to provide services where the performance of such service would create a conflict of
interest or creates an appearance of impropriety. A NAF employee can sign a personal services
contract within the same Squadron in which they are employed, provided the employee is not
contracted to perform services that the employee performs in their NAF position.
3.16. Reemployment of NAF Annuitant. If a retired NAF employee is rehired in a regular
employment category, the annuity will be suspended while he or she remains on the active rolls.
A reemployed annuitant may elect to be reinstated in the retirement plan to increase the annuity.
If an annuitant whose annuity is based on disability is hired, regardless of the employment
category, the NAF-HR must immediately give written notice to HQ AFSVA/SVXHB. The
annuity payments of the retired NAF employee are not affected if the annuitant is hired into a
flex category position.

3.17. Veteran Reemployment Rights. Reemployment rights after military service must be
administered according to the provisions in 38 U.S.C., Chapter 43.
     3.17.1. When a regular or flexible employee other than those on NTE appointments, enters
     the U.S. Armed Forces and signifies his or her intent in writing to return to employment
     within the same Squadron the NAF-HR takes these actions:
        3.17.1.1. Initiates AF Form 2545, placing the employee in a LWOP status entitled
        "Military Furlough."
        3.17.1.2. Initiates payment of employee's accrued annual leave.
        3.17.1.3. Maintains sick leave credits in the employee's account.
        3.17.1.4. Counsels the employee about continuing or terminating participation in the
        NAFI Group Insurance Plan according to pre-established instructions from the Insurance
        Branch, and informs the employee of his or her reinstatement option upon the employee’s
        return to active status.
        3.17.1.5. Requires the employee sign a position description/guide of the position to
        which assigned on the last day of duty.
        3.17.1.6. Retains the employee's OPF in the active files of the NAF-HR.
        3.17.1.7. Carries the employee on employment rolls for a maximum of five calendar
        years, from the effective date shown on the personnel action placing him or her in a
        military furlough status.
     3.17.2. If an employee resigns to enter the Armed Forces and indicates that he or she does
     not intend to return to the employing Squadron on his or her release from active duty, an
     AF Form 2545, is processed as a voluntary separation.
     3.17.3. Employees who return from service in the U.S. Armed Forces under honorable
     conditions are given veteran reemployment rights in the Squadron where he or she was
     employed just before entering military service. The rights of the veteran and the obligation
     of the employer are limited to the same Squadron. The following rules must be followed
     when helping the veteran find NAFI employment:
        3.17.3.1. The veteran is reemployed by the same Squadron within 30 days after
        application, subject to those terms in paragraphs 3.17.3.2 through 3.17.3.4.
        3.17.3.2. The veteran is restored to his or her former position, if the position still exists,
        even though a business-based action may be necessary to make the position available for
        the veteran. If the position has been reclassified to a higher level, without substantial
        changes in responsibility, he or she is entitled to those benefits of the reclassification.
        3.17.3.3. If restoration is not possible because the former position no longer exists, the
        veteran is placed in an available position of like status and pay in the same Squadron.
        3.17.3.4. If reemployment through the above procedures is not possible, the Squadron
        offers the veteran the next best available position for which the individual qualifies. This
        means a position that most closely approximates in status and pay the position he or she
        formerly occupied.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  51


   3.17.4. After restoration, a veteran is given full credit for step increases and cost of living
   allowances to which he or she would have been entitled had he or she not been in the
   military. All unused sick leave from the period of previous employment is recredited. The
   SCD is not adjusted for the period of military furlough.
   3.17.5. A veteran restored under those terms in paragraph 3.17.3 may not be separated, other
   than for cause, within 1 year after date of reinstatement by the same Squadron.
   3.17.6. If the veteran believes he or she was denied reemployment by the same Squadron at
   the time of his or her return from active military service, he or she may initiate an appeal in
   accordance with the procedures in Chapter 9.
3.18. Voluntary Service. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1588, certain voluntary services may be
accepted in programs providing services to military members and their families. Such programs
include family support, child development and youth services, library and education, religious,
housing referral, employment assistance, and morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) programs.
Volunteers may be family members, ODM, or members of the civilian community. They may
perform services described in AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility. Custodians
and managers may use volunteers to perform specific duties, similar to those of established NAF
positions.
   3.18.1. Volunteers must not perform duties that are recurring in nature and that are usually
   performed by NAF employees. Volunteers may supplement the established work force. They
   may not replace or succeed NAF employees.
   3.18.2. No NAF salary, wage, or other compensation is authorized for volunteers, nor may
   any volunteer be appointed retroactively to a NAF position.
3.19. Employment of APF Civil Service Annuitants in NAF Positions. The DoD has
authority regarding hiring and compensating civil service annuitants. Section 9902(j) of title 5,
USC, as enacted by section 1101 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2004, Pub. L.
108-136 (November 24, 2003), authorizes DoD to employ civil service annuitants without
reducing salary or annuity. This authority affects NAFI hiring of annuitants who elected to
remain in the CSRS or the FERS upon moving between the NAF and civil service personnel
systems.
   3.19.1. This guidance implements the DoD authority and establishes criteria for its use. It
   applies to CSRS or FERS annuitants who previously elected to remain in the CSRS or FERS
   and who are employed in a NAF permanent or limited-term position on or after 24 November
   2003.
       3.19.1.1. There is no retroactive application of the new authority. The provisions of this
       guidance apply to new appointments or conversions to new appointments made on or
       after 24 November 2003.
       3.19.1.2. Annuitants hired before 24 November 2003 are subject to salary offset and may
       continue to serve in their positions. However, their salary will continue to be offset by
       the amount of the annuity received for the period of employment.
       3.19.1.3. Annuitants hired prior to 24 November 2003, who are currently serving in a
       position and receiving full salary and annuity based on an exception approved by the
52                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


        OPM or by DoD under delegated authority, will continue to receive full salary and
        annuity for the time specified by the waiver.
        3.19.1.4. An annuitant may not be employed in the same position held prior to
        retirement, except as provided by policy contained in this guidance.
        3.19.1.5. An employee who separated under authority of the Voluntary Separation
        Incentive Pay (VSIP) Program is prohibited from reemployment within the DoD for
        twelve months after separation unless the Secretary of Defense or designee approves a
        waiver on a case-by-case basis. An employee may not be reemployed within five years
        unless he/she repays the separation incentive. Reemployment restrictions are specified in
        5 U.S.C 9902(i) of the National Security Personnel System (NSPS) and implementing
        DoD VSIP guidance and procedures.
     3.19.2. Employment of Annuitants.
        3.19.2.1. The employment of a CSRS or FERS annuitant are subject to the following
        criteria:
           3.19.2.1.1. In positions that are hard-to-fill as evidenced by historically high
           turnover, a severe shortage of candidates or other significant recruiting difficulty; or
           positions that are critical to the accomplishment of the organization’s mission; or to
           complete a specific project or initiative;
           3.19.2.1.2. Annuitants who have unique or specialized skills, or unusual
           qualifications not generally available; or
           3.19.2.1.3. For not more than 2087 hours (e.g., one employee guaranteed 40 hours
           for one year, or one employee guaranteed twenty hours for two years) to mentor less
           experienced employees and/or to provide continuity during critical organizational
           transitions. Extensions beyond 2087 hours are not authorized.
        3.19.2.2. If a supervisor or manager elects to reemploy an annuitant in the same
        organization in the same (or substantially similar) position as the position from which the
        annuitant retired, the action must have prior approval from the Force Support
        Commander/Director, who must certify in writing that one or more of the above
        conditions exist.
     3.19.3. Documentation and Data System Requirements
        3.19.3.1. Optional Form 306, Declaration for Federal Employment, number fifteen,
        provides an applicant’s notification to the NAF-HR that the applicant is a Federal civilian
        annuitant.
        3.19.3.2. The DCPDS currently contains the functionality required to appoint
        reemployed annuitants. These appointments will be tracked in DCPDS by data element,
        to include the reason for the appointment of the annuitant. Employees who meet the
        requirements of a reemployed annuitant under portability retirement rules, as outlined in
        this guidance, are processed using N015, Appointment-Public Law 101-508.
        3.19.3.3. Reemployed annuitants are identified in DCPDS in two areas.
Request for Personnel Action (RPA)/Appointment Family/Employee and Position Data tab/Item

       the right side of the OPF beneath the appointment action.
   3.19.5. Accountability. Managers and supervisors are responsible for the appropriate use of
   this authority to support mission requirements. The authority to employ annuitants as
   defined in this guidance may not be used solely to benefit employees or retirees.
3.20. Agreement for the Movement of Personnel Between the Civil Service System and the
NAFI System in the DoD. In accordance with the authority provided in Title V, Section 6.7 of
the Civil Service Rules, and pursuant to the agreement with the DoD, employees serving in
NAFIs may be appointed to positions in the competitive civil service, and employees serving in
positions in the competitive civil service may be appointed to NAFI positions, subject to the
following conditions:
   3.20.1. Type of Appointment Held Before Movement. To be eligible for movement under
   this agreement, employees must be currently serving under a competitive career or career-
   conditional appointment or under a NAFI appointment or have been involuntarily separated
   from such appointment without personal cause within the preceding year. NAFI employees
   must be or have been serving in continuing NAFI positions under appointments without time
   limits.
   3.20.2. Qualification Requirements. NAFI employees must meet the qualification
   standards and requirements for the position to which they are to be appointed in accordance
   with OPM established regulations for transfer of employees within the competitive service.
   Employees in the competitive service must meet the regular standards and requirements
   established by DoD for appointment to NAFI positions.
   3.20.3. Length of Service Requirement. NAFI employees must have served continuously
   for at least one-year in NAFI positions before they may be appointed to positions in the
   competitive civil service under the authority of this agreement. Employees in the

   connection with their career or career conditional appointments in the competitive service
   before they may be appointed to NAFI positions, without serving a trial period, under the
   authority of this agreement.
   3.20.4. Selection. NAFI employees may be considered for appointment to positions in the
   competitive civil service in the same manner that employees of the competitive service may
   be considered for transfer to such positions. Employees in the competitive service may be
   considered for appointment to any NAFI position on the basis of their qualifications.
54                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


     3.20.5. Type of Appointment Granted After Movement. NAFI employees who are
     appointed to competitive positions under the terms of this agreement will have career or
     career conditional appointments, depending upon whether they meet the threeyear service
     requirement for career tenure. The service, which commences with a permanent NAFI
     appointment, will be accepted toward meeting the competitive service requirement.
     Employees of the competitive service who are appointed to NAFI positions under the terms
     of this agreement will receive appointments without time limit under DoDI 1400.25, DoD
     Civilian Personnel Management System.
     3.20.6. Probationary and Trial Periods. Employees appointed under this agreement, who
     have previously completed a probationary or trial period, will not be required to serve a new
     probationary or trial period.

     the terms of this agreement will receive competitive civil service status. Thereafter, such
     employees will be entitled to the benefits and privileges provided by the Civil Service Rules
     and by OPM's regulations and instructions for persons having competitive civil service
     status. Employees of the competitive civil service appointed to NAFI positions under the
     terms of this agreement will have whatever privileges are normally provided to persons who
     initially receive appointments, under DoDI 1400.25, to continuing NAFI positions.
     3.20.8. Effective Date. This agreement was effective 21 Sep 91, and shall remain in effect
     indefinitely. The agreement may be terminated following notice from the DoD or OPM and
     may be modified at any time with the mutual consent of the DoD and OPM.

                                EMPLOYMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. Establishment of Positions. Management establishes a position by writing a new PD and
PG to match the duties of the position and forwards it to the NAF-HR for classification. The
NAF-HR determines the official position title, occupational series, and appropriate grade or pay
band.
4.2. Qualification Requirements:
     4.2.1. Qualification standards are the minimum experience, training, education, and physical
     requirements needed to perform the duties of the position involved, in a satisfactory manner.
     Job qualification requirements must be based on factual job duties and established in a
     manner that encourages completion for the job with the goal of hiring the most qualified
     person available. In applying physical standards, the employee must be able to perform his
     or her duties in a satisfactory manner and without hazard to self or others.
     4.2.2. Management decides what job experience and skills are needed for the position and
     determines qualification requirements. Guidance is provided from the NAF-HR, as
     requested. OPM and DoD qualification standards may be used as a guide in making
     determinations. Regulations are available for review in the NAF-HR. Qualification
     requirements are noted on the AF Form 1702, Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Position Guide.
     4.2.3. Waiving Qualifications. When an employee is facing separation by business based
     action, waiving qualifications may be considered when there are no other placement offers
     available. Qualifications may be waived by the supervisor to assign such an employee to a
     vacant position as long as the employee shows the capacity, adaptability, and special skills
     needed to satisfactorily perform the duties and responsibilities of the position. Guidelines for
     the development and use of qualification standards are found at Attachments 6 and 7.
4.3. Employment Requirements. To ensure the most suitable and qualified persons work in
NAFIs at all levels, installation commanders must ensure established recruiting procedures are
followed to the fullest extent practicable. Depending on the nature and extent of responsibilities
of the position being filled, employment procedures established include:
     4.3.1. Submission of an employment application form.
     4.3.2. Medical evidence of satisfactory health condition.
     4.3.3. Compliance with the dual compensation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5531, if applicable.

  85, Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, for all others) for initiation of the National
  Agency Check with Inquiries are required for locally identified positions, all child care and
  youth positions, and all positions requiring access to an automated information system (AIS).
  These forms request background information concerning arrests, violations of the law,
  employment, and financial history. For those positions where the NACI is required due to
  access to AIS, the NAF-HR will make a preliminary suitability determination for Federal
  employment according to 5 CFR Part 731, Suitability, based on the information provided on
  these forms. Applicants found not suitable are not hired. Employees found suitable for
  Federal employment are eligible for appointment and may be granted interim access to
  Federal computer activities pending completion of the NACI. When completion of the NACI
  is not practical prior to entry on duty, the NACI is requested at the time of appointment and
  the employee may occupy the position with the prior written approval of the squadron
  Commander or Director or designated representative.
  4.3.7. Favorably completed NACI, IRC, and SCHRC for employees in child and youth
  programs and other positions that deal with children under 18 years of age in accordance
  with DoD Instruction 1402.5, Criminal History Background Checks on Individuals in Child
  Care Services, 19 Jan 93. IRCs consists of local record checks on applicants for a minimum
  of two years. Prior to selection of an applicant, only the local record check of information
  available at the current installation must be favorably completed. Any additional checks
  required to complete the review at prior installations will begin immediately after an
  individual has been selected. Favorable completion of the IRC must be made a condition of
  employment in all cases. When it is not possible to complete CNACIs prior to entry on duty,
  the NAF-HR and the manager of the employing organization must carefully review the
  application and complete pre-employment reference checks. Pending satisfactory completion
  of the NACI, the selectee may immediately be brought on the rolls under carefully regulated
  direct line of sight supervision. Prospective childcare employees complete an Authority for
  Release of Information and Records to submit with their applications for employment.
  4.3.8. When a NACI is required, requests are prepared in accordance with AFI 31-501,
  Personnel Security Program Management.
  4.3.9. Verification of DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty.
  4.3.10. Satisfactory completion of any required physical or Serv Safe examinations. The AF
  Form 2545 for employees appointed to such positions must show satisfactory completion of
  the physical examination within the first 60 days is a condition of employment. Physical
  examinations completed within the 3 months prior to employment can be used to meet the
58                                                        AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


     requirement as long as the physical included the elements described in the position
     guide/description; otherwise, the employee must complete a new physical examination that
     does cover the required areas. Within the first 60 days of employment, the individual must
     provide a copy of the physical examination results to the NAF-HR, which determines
     whether the individual meets the physical requirements of the position.
     4.3.11. Compliance with military spouse preference, THP and veteran’s preference.
     4.3.12. Ensure selectees meet the required qualifications of the position.
     4.3.13. Ensure suitability of applicants using 5 CFR Part 731, Suitability, as a guide.
     4.3.14. Ensure preliminary actions of selecting officials are proper.
     4.3.15. Ensure selectees for all positions in youth or child development (including those not
     classified to the CY pay plan) get or have required immunizations. As a condition of
     employment, these employees are administered appropriate vaccines in accordance with
     AFJI 48-110, Immunizations and Chemoprophylaxis, against measles, mumps, rubella,
     tetanus, diphtheria, and polio, unless immune based on documented receipt of vaccine series
     or physician-diagnosed illness. For rubella, immunity is based on documented receipt of
     vaccine series or laboratory evidence of immunity. Administer influenza vaccine annually to
     all employees in youth or child development positions.
4.4. Methods of Filling Positions. Positions may be filled by promotions, reassignments,
management reassignments, details, changes to lower grade or pay band, or recruitment from
outside sources.
     4.4.1. Management determines a candidate's qualifications based on a review of the
     candidate's application, and selects the best-qualified candidate to fill a position vacancy,

         period requirement for AF NAF employees who transfer in from another AF NAF

        termination and the effective date of the action. The memorandum is coordinated with
        the NAF-HR prior to giving to the employee. A minimum of twenty-four hours notice is
        required. The notice memorandum will include:
            4.6.6.2.1. A statement of the specific action to be taken, for example, "This is to

            designated to address any questions the employee may have.

            the NAF grievance or appeal procedures.
        4.6.6.3. The supervisor forwards a copy of the separation memorandum along with
        AF Form 2548, documenting the action, to the NAF-HR for processing. The NAF-HR
        prepares and issues an AF Form 2545.
     4.6.7. Documentation. The NAF-HR maintains the material used to support the action and
     the separation memorandum in a case file apart from the employee's OPF.
     4.6.8. Separation during the probationary period is not subject to the NAFI grievance or
     appeal procedures; however, complaints that such separation was based, in whole or in part,
     on discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, physical or mental handicap, age, or
     national origin are processed according to AFI 36-1201, Equal Employment Opportunity
     Complaints.

   5.1.5. Do not detail an employee for more than 60 consecutive days to a lower grade or pay
   band position.
   5.1.6. Do not detail an employee for more than 60 consecutive days to a position in the same

     NAF Career Program. The NAF-HR contacts the Career Program to ensure the person being

   guaranteed hours; pay is set according to table 18.8, rule 7.
   5.2.3. Employees may request reassignment to other positions by completing AF Form 2550
   and submitting it to the NAF-HR. This request could result in a decrease or an increase in
   the scheduled rate of pay due to level of responsibility of the new position. Refer to tables
   18.7 and 18.8 for guidance on reassignments between pay systems.
   5.2.4. Temporary Reassignments. A temporary reassignment is useful when an
   employee's services are needed temporarily in a position in the same grade or pay band.
   Terminate a temporary reassignment when the need no longer exists. Accomplish a
   reassignment by submitting an AF Form 2548 along with the PD and PG to the NAF-HR.
      5.2.4.1. A temporary reassignment must be expected to last at least two pay periods (4
      weeks) and may not extend beyond six months.
      5.2.4.2. An employee's guaranteed hours cannot be lowered when temporarily reassigned
      on an involuntary basis.
      5.2.4.3. In the event a BBA occurs, an employee on temporary reassignment competes
      under his or her officially assigned position, not the temporary assignment.
      5.2.4.4. An employee returns to his or her previous position at the end of the temporary
      reassignment unless permanently reassigned.
      5.2.4.5. Temporary reassignments into career-covered positions must be coordinated
      through the NAF Career Program. The NAF-HR contacts the Career Program to ensure
      the person being temporarily reassigned is qualified and registered in the NAF Career
      Program. Once the action is processed, the NAF-HR provides the Career Program a copy
      of the AF Form 2545.
5.3. Promotions. A promotion is the change of an employee from one grade or pay band to a
higher grade or pay band within the same pay schedule. A promotion may also result when
changing from one pay schedule to another pay schedule.
   5.3.1. Temporary Promotions. Promotions with time limitations may be made
   noncompetitively when an employee's services are needed in a higher grade or pay band
   position, and the employee meets the qualification requirements for the position. The
   supervisor submits an AF Form 2548 along with the PD and PG to the NAF-HR to process
   the action. The employee returns to his or her previous position at the end of the temporary
   promotion.
      5.3.1.1. A temporary promotion must be expected to last for a minimum of two pay
      periods (four weeks) and may not extend beyond six months.
      5.3.1.2. In the event a BBA occurs, an employee on temporary promotion competes
      under his or her officially assigned position, not the temporary assignment.
      5.3.1.3. An employee's guaranteed hours cannot be lowered when temporarily promoted
      on an involuntary basis.
      5.3.1.4. An employee returns to his or her previous position at the end of the temporary
      promotion unless permanently promoted through the competitive process.

        5.3.1.5. Temporary promotions into career-covered positions must be coordinated
        through the NAF Career Program. The NAF-HR contacts the Career Program to ensure
        the person being temporarily promoted is qualified and registered in the NAF Career
        Program. Once the action is processed, the NAF-HR provides the Career Program a copy
        of the AF Form 2545.
     5.3.2. Permanent Promotions. All permanent promotions are competitive unless:
        5.3.2.1. The promotion is the result of job growth;
        5.3.2.2. The promotion is the result of improper classification;
        5.3.2.3. The promotion is required to comply with a new classification standard; or
        5.3.2.4. The promotion follows competitive assignment to a developmental position. A
        developmental position is a restructured position designed to help employees with
        potential, but lacking qualifications, to become qualified for current or projected
        positions through competitive selection for mission-supportive job experience and job-
        related training and education.
     5.3.3. The employee must meet the qualification requirements for the position.
     5.3.4. Employees may complete AF Form 2550 for any higher grade or pay band position at
     any time. The form is submitted to the NAF-HR and maintained as long as the employee is
     employed or is placed in the applicable position.
     5.3.5. The PG and/or PD must be rewritten and submitted to the NAF-HR for classification
     if the duties of a position change significantly. The employee may be noncompetitively
     promoted when the NAF-HR determines that the change in duties is due to job growth if the
     new duties result in a higher grade or pay band.
        5.3.5.1. Job growth occurs when the position is upgraded due to accretion/assignment of
        additional higher grade duties and responsibilities.            The incumbent may be
        noncompetitively promoted provided there is clear evidence that the employee continues
        to perform the same basic functions as in the former position, there are no other
        employees serving in similar or identical positions to which the duties could be assigned,
        and he or she meets all qualification and legal requirements for promotion. In this case,
        there must be clear evidence that the newly classified position is a successor to the former
        and that the higher-graded position has absorbed the major duties of the former position
        as determined by the NAF-HR and the former position is abolished.
     5.3.6. NF and CY employees must receive a minimum of a 6% pay adjustment when
     promoted, whether temporary or permanent.
     5.3.7. All promotions are accomplished by submitting an AF Form 2548, the selectee's
     application, and the PD and PG, to the NAF-HR for processing.
5.4. Change of Employment Category. An employee on a flexible appointment may be
changed to regular at any time by the manager submitting an AF Form 2548 to the NAF-HR for
processing. A change of employment category from regular to flexible, unless initiated at the
employee's request, is processed as a BBA in accordance with Chapter 6. A change from regular
to flexible at the employee's request may be taken at any time, provided the employee submits
the request in writing by completing an AF Form 2550.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   69


5.5. Interview, Selection, and Release of Employees:
   5.5.1. Interviews. The selecting supervisor may interview candidates and visit the NAF-HR
   to get information from employee's records. Interviews are a useful tool that management
   should use to assess personal characteristics and potential for assuming the duties of the
   position. This is especially important when filling supervisory vacancies, because the
   success of any organization is directly related to the capacity and skills of supervisors, line
   managers, and executives who make decisions and direct or lead others in completing the
   organization's mission. Attachment 8 contains guidance on interview objectives and
   techniques.
   5.5.2. Number of Considerations. There is no limit on the number of times an applicant or
   current employee may be considered for vacant positions.
   5.5.3. Release of Employees. The selecting supervisor contacts the losing supervisor and
   arranges for a tentative release date; and notifies the NAF-HR, who establishes the effective
   date. Employees usually are released within fifteen calendar days after the losing supervisor
   is notified of the selection. Losing and gaining supervisors may agree on an extension (of
   not more than ten additional days) to train a replacement or other emergency needs; but, in
   no case is an employee's release date conditioned on the ability to get a replacement.
5.6. Separations:
   5.6.1. Retirement. Retirement is effected voluntarily, according to AFI 34-302, Air Force
   Nonappropriated Fund Employee Retirement Plan.
   5.6.2. Resignation (Regular and Flexible Employees). Resignations are voluntary,
   initiated by the employee who should give sufficient notice, preferably at least two weeks, on
   AF Form 2548, to permit his or her supervisor to get a replacement. A forwarding address is
   required. The effective date of the action is the last day the employee expects to work. In
   the event of an oral resignation, the supervisor completes the applicable portion of the
   AF Form 2548 to show the date of oral notice and the effective date. A resignation may not
   be withdrawn without prior approval of the supervisor, in consultation with the NAF-HR.
   5.6.3. Termination. A flexible employee may be terminated for any valid reason other than
   BBA with a minimum of 24-hours notice. For BBA terminations, a minimum 7-day notice is
   required. Involuntary terminations are made without regard to race, color, sex, national
   origin, age, handicapping condition, marital status, political affiliation, or membership in any
   organization, including a labor organization.
   5.6.4. Separation (Regular Employees). Management initiated actions will normally be
   processed under BBA procedures as these actions are used to adjust resources in response to
   reorganization, realignment of workload, elimination of duties or responsibilities from a
   position. Prior to processing a separation action for a Career Program employee, the NAF-
   HR reviews the employee’s records to ensure the transportation agreement has been fulfilled
   prior to separation. The Career Program must be notified of pending resignation or
   separation actions. Employees who separate during the initial 12-month period must
   reimburse the central AF MWR fund, through his/her NAF Accounting Office, for all costs
   expended for their PCS move.

     5.6.5. Removal (Regular Employees). An action taken by management to separate a
     regular employee for cause, which may be used in cases of performance, misconduct, or
     serious delinquency.
     5.6.6. Resignation-Abandonment (Regular and Flexible Employees). An employee who
     fails to report for work or notify management for three consecutive workdays without a
     reasonable explanation is considered to have resigned.
     5.6.7. Other Separations, e.g., death; loyalty or security reasons; or, other valid reasons, such
     as conflict of interest, which cannot be resolved except by termination without prejudice.
     5.6.8. Disability. Separation for disability may be necessary when an employee's physical
     or mental condition renders him or her incapable of continuing employment. Employees
     must not be separated for an onthejob injury without written approval from HQ
     AFSVA/SVXH.
5.7. Dissolution of a NAFI. BBA procedures are required when a NAFI is dissolved. The
NAF-HR processes all personnel actions. If an installation is deactivated before all personnel
actions have been processed, procedures must be established to ensure continued NAF-HR
support and any remaining personnel actions are completed.
5.8. Transfer of Function and Movement of Employees Between NAFIs:
     5.8.1. A transfer of function is the transfer of the responsibility for the performance of a
     continuing function from one NAFI to one or more NAFIs within or between DoD
     components located in the same or another commuting area. An employee has no right to
     transfer with his or her function regardless of their personal preference, unless the alternative
     is separation or downgrading.
     5.8.2. All transfers of function between U.S. AF NAFIs are subject to case-by-case written
     agreements between losing and gaining NAFIs and approval by the installation commander
     or commanders concerned. If the movement includes one or more NAFIs at the MAJCOM
     level, one of the AF central NAFIs or the Army and Air Force Civilian Welfare Fund, all
     fund custodians involved must concur with the NAFIs' agreements.
     5.8.3. All transfers of function between U.S. AF and non-U.S. AF NAFIs are directed at
     HQ USAF level.
     5.8.4. To provide equity and employment continuity, a regular NAF employee, whose
     position is identified in a transfer of function and who has the right to transfer, is afforded the
     opportunity to transfer with his or her position.
        5.8.4.1. If the employee who accepts the transfer offer can be placed in the NAFI to
        which the function is transferred, either into a vacant position or through BBA
        procedures, the employee is transferred to the gaining NAFI.
        5.8.4.2. If the employee who accepts the transfer offer cannot be placed in the gaining
        NAFI, either in a vacant position or through BBA procedures, the employee is separated
        through BBA procedures as if he or she had been employed by the gaining NAFI
        although the employee is not physically moved nor a transfer action processed.
        5.8.4.3. If the employee declines a transfer of function offer, he or she is separated,
        unless placement into another NAF position is accomplished.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               71


     5.8.4.4. If the employee is not placed in the gaining NAFI or does not accept an offer of
     transfer of function, he or she is offered placement assistance by the NAF-HR servicing
     the losing NAFI.
  5.8.5. A regular DoD component NAF employee who completes his or her probationary
  period, and hired by a different DoD component NAFI within 6 months after removal from
  pay status because of a BBA in the losing NAFI, is considered to have transferred to the
  gaining NAFI only for purposes outlined in paragraphs 5.8.6, 5.8.8, and 5.8.10.
  5.8.6. When a NAF employee who is participating in the losing NAFI retirement plan
  terminates employment for reasons other than retirement and is employed by another DoD
  component NAFI within 90 calendar days, and the gaining NAFI offers a different retirement
  plan, the employee may carry forward into the gaining NAFI’s retirement plan his or her
  credited service accrued for retirement annuity purposes.
  5.8.7. Upon transfer, if otherwise eligible for group health and life insurance coverage
  offered by the gaining DoD NAFI, the employee must enroll in that group insurance plan
  within one month from the date employment begins with the gaining NAFI. When applied
  for within this one month period, coverage is effective with the date of application.
  5.8.8. An employee who transfers from one NAFI to another within DoD is given service
  credit for his or her prior DoD NAFI employment.
  5.8.9. A NAF employee shall receive a lump-sum payment for any unused annual leave
  credited to the employee's leave record when he or she separates from one of the six major
  NAF employers (the Army, the Navy Personnel Command, the Navy Exchange Service
  Command, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Army and Air Force Exchange Service).
  However, if a NAF employee is transferring from one NAFI to another NAFI, the employee's
  annual leave credit and the funds to cover its cost may be transferred from the losing to
  gaining employer if the two employers agree and the employee elects such a transfer of credit
  instead of receipt of a lump-sum payment.
  5.8.10. All accumulated sick leave credit is transferred by the losing NAFI to the gaining
  NAFI provided the individual is placed in a pay status in the gaining NAFI within 6 months.
  However, no transfer of funds is made from losing to gaining NAFIs for sick leave credits
  transferred. The gaining activity assumes the financial obligation.

                                            Chapter 6

                                 Business Based Actions (BBAs)

6.1. Definition. A BBA is a reduction in employment category or pay rate, a change to lower
grade or pay band, a furlough of eight calendar days or more, or a separation action initiated by
management for non-disciplinary reasons. Use BBAs to adjust resources in response to
reorganization, realignment of workload, elimination of duties or responsibilities from a position,
lack of funds, or from a need to be competitive with pay in the local labor market. Do not use to
address a performance or conduct deficiency, or to downgrade a position because of a change in
classification standards, or correction of a misclassification. Employees are affected by BBAs
only if so identified after an objective, fair and equitable ranking against other employees in the
same employment category, occupational series, grade or pay band, and in the same NAF
activity (e.g., Officers' Club, bowling center, enlisted club, etc.). Employees on details,
temporary reassignments, or temporary promotions compete under their officially assigned
position, not the temporary assignment.
     6.1.1. Exception to the ranking procedures contained in paragraph 6.1,( i.e., ranking
     employees against other employees in the same employment category, occupational series,
     grade or pay band), are made only when the NAF-HR determines the duties and
     qualifications of the positions affected, when ranked together, are so different the affected
     employees assigned to them could not move to other positions in the same ranking without
     an inordinate amount of training, resulting in disruption of the activity. In this case, such
     positions are ranked separately. For example, club operations assistant, NF-1101-III and a
     vending manager, NF-1101-III, working in the same facility, are not ranked against each
     other should the NAF-HR decide the provisions for exception as stated above apply.
     Normally, exceptions are not granted for lower graded positions, where relative distinctions
     are rarely discernible.
     6.1.2. The authority to make the decision to allow an exception to the ranking procedures as
     described in paragraph 6.1, is with the NAF-HR, and is based solely on review of the PGs
     and PDs of the affected positions.
6.2. Coverage. BBA provisions cover both regular and flexible employees. However, flexible
employees are not covered if they are furloughed, nor do they have a right to Step 3 of the appeal
process (i.e., appeal above the base level). Additionally, regular employees currently serving a
probationary period as a result of initial appointment to AF NAF employment, and flexible
employees who have been on the rolls of the NAF activity effecting the BBA for less than three
continuous years are affected by a BBA prior to any other regular employee or any flexible
employee who has been on the rolls of the NAF activity effecting the BBA for at least three
consecutive years.
6.3. Coordination. The NAF-HR has an active role in the BBA process. All proposed BBAs
are reviewed by the NAF-HR prior to finalization. The NAF-HR determines the order in which
employees will be affected by the proposed BBA. All notice memorandums of BBA will be
reviewed by the NAF-HR, and the NAF-HR is encouraged to coordinate BBA memorandums
with the base legal office before issuance.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 73


6.4. Types of BBAs. The following actions are considered BBAs:
   6.4.1. Reduction in pay rate
   6.4.2. Furlough. An action to furlough a regular employee (flexible employees are
   excluded) for eight calendar days or more (a temporary layoff for a definite or indefinite
   period of time).
   6.4.3. Change in employment category from regular to flexible
   6.4.4. Change to lower grade or pay band
   6.4.5. Separation
6.5. Factors to Consider. Careful planning is necessary to lessen adverse effects, prepare
employees, and to avoid administrative and morale problems. It is important to consider whether
the cause of the reduction or realignment is a temporary or permanent situation, along with each
of the various actions that may be taken. For example, a change in employment category, a
reduction in pay rate, or a furlough may be more appropriate than separation. In all BBAs,
flexible employees with less than three continuous years on the rolls of the NAF activity
effecting the BBA, and regular employees who are currently serving a probationary period as a
result of initial appointment to AF NAF employment in the NAF activity effecting the BBA, and
who are, in both cases, in the same occupational series, and the same grade or pay band, are
affected by the BBA prior to any other employee. Prior to changing a regular employee to a
flexible employment category, management must determine whether the benefit derived from the
action can be accomplished by first reducing the flexible employee work force.
6.6. Procedures:
   6.6.1. Determining Affected Employees. Covered employees are ranked to determine the
   order in which they are affected (unless all employees are equally affected; separation due to
   base closure, for example). The ranking process takes into account both performance and
   seniority. Performance is the primary criterion. The NAF-HR performs the ranking process
   by using the average of the total scores on the last two performance evaluations completed on
   the employee and on file in the employee's OPF. Employees not working due to a workers’
   compensation injury or illness are covered employees, and are affected by BBAs on the same
   schedule as other NAF employees within the same activity as the incapacitated employee.
       6.6.1.1. If only one performance evaluation is on file for the employee, then only that
       evaluation's total score is used.
       6.6.1.2. If no performance evaluations are on file for the employee, then the NAF-HR
       assigns a presumptive rating of satisfactory, rating code "3" on each of the Work
       Behavior Elements on AF Form 3527, NAF Employee Performance Evaluation, after
       which the total score will be used in the ranking process. The NAF-HR annotates this
       rating as presumptive, signs the form, and files it in the BBA case file. Presumptive
       ratings assigned as part of the BBA process are not grievable.
       6.6.1.3. If the group of covered employees to be ranked includes nonsupervisory and
       supervisory employees, the supervisory elements are not used in the ranking process. If
       all covered employees to be ranked are supervisors, then the total of all elements is used
       in the ranking process.
74                                                       AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


        6.6.1.4. Employees are separated into four separate categories. The total score on the
        Work Behavior Elements on the AF Form 3527, determines the order in which
        employees are ranked within these categories. To effect the BBA, employees in
        Category 1 with the lowest total score are affected first, the next lowest total score
        second, etc., until all Category 1 employees are exhausted. After Category 1, employees
        in Category 2 are affected in the same order until exhausted, after which Category 3
        employees are affected. The last employees affected are Category 4 employees. If two or
        more employees have the same total score, the SCD for seniority (SCD-RIF) for regular
        or the length of service for flexible employees is used to determine the ranking. The four
        categories are as follows:
            6.6.1.4.1. Category 1: Flexible employees on the rolls of the NAF activity effecting
            the BBA for less than three continuous years.
            6.6.1.4.2. Category 2: Regular employees currently serving a probationary period as
            a result of initial appointment to AF NAF employment.
            6.6.1.4.3. Category 3: Flexible employees on the rolls of the NAF activity affecting
            the BBA for at least three continuous years.
            6.6.1.4.4. Category 4: Regular employees who completed their probationary period.
        6.6.1.5. The NAF-HR maintains the ranking of each covered employee, the process used
        to determine the ranking, and a copy of the notice given to each employee in a separate
        BBA file apart from any employee's OPF. Subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act,
        the BBA file is made available for review upon request only by an affected employee, or
        by those whose official duties require access.
     6.6.2. Advance Notice. Management gives an employee affected by a BBA advance notice
     of the effective date. The length of the advance notice varies, depending on the status of the
     employee and other factors.
        6.6.2.1. Regular Employees. The minimum advance notice period for regular
        employees is seven calendar days for a nonseparation action and thirty calendar days for
        a separation action.
        6.6.2.2. Flexible Employees. The minimum advance notice period for flexible
        employees is twenty-four hours for a nonseparation action and seven calendar days for a
        separation action.
        6.6.2.3. Employees in Career Program Positions. If the BBA is to separate an
        incumbent of a NAF career program position, the employee is provided advance notice of
        a minimum of 60 days.
            6.6.2.3.1. MAJCOM Placement. Prior to being placed in the PPR program, the
            MAJCOM must determine if a management reassignment is possible within the
            MAJCOM. If the MAJCOM is unable to place the employee they must notify the
            Career Program (in writing) and request the employee be placed in the PPR program.
            6.6.2.3.2. LWOP Pending Offer. At the end of the 60-day period, individuals on a
            PPR certificate, awaiting a job offer are placed on leave without pay (LWOP)
            pending results of the selection to avoid a break in service.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                75


         6.6.2.3.3. Election of LWOP. At the end of the 60-day period, individuals who have
         not received a job offer may elect to be placed in LWOP status for a maximum of 30
         days. Those who elect LWOP status will not receive severance pay until the end of
         the 30-day LWOP period. The losing base continues the employee’s insurance
         during the 30-day LWOP period provided the employee continues to pay their portion
         of the premiums.
         6.6.2.3.4. Changes During Notice Period. The NAF-HR must immediately notify the
         MAJCOM and Career Program of any changes (i.e., base extends the separation
         date).
     6.6.2.4. Base Closure Actions. Base closure actions involving incumbents of NAF
     career program positions are treated as BBAs. Advance notice of at least 60 days is
     provided. The installation commander reviews the proposed action prior to notifying the
     employee. After review by the commander, a copy of the action is forwarded to the
     appropriate MAJCOM/A1S and the NAF Career Program. MAJCOM NAF-HRs
     maintain oversight responsibility for program administration. MAJCOMs provide
     priority placement in coordination with the Career Program. If the employee is not
     placed in a new position prior to the end of the 60-day notice period, the employee is
     separated.
     6.6.2.5. Emergency Conditions. Under emergency conditions (e.g., breakdown of
     equipment or other emergency conditions requiring suspension of operations, heightened
     security conditions limiting entrance to the facilities or an unanticipated reduction in
     business such as occurs with a sudden deployment of troops), a minimum of 24-hours
     notice may be given to any employee for other than separation actions.
  6.6.3. Notice Memorandum. The notice to an affected employee is in writing and,
  whenever possible, hand delivered by the supervisor. The notice memorandum is prepared
  by the supervisor, and signed after it has been coordinated with the NAF-HR, and contains at
  a minimum:
     6.6.3.1. The employee's position title, occupational series, grade or pay band, and rate of
     pay.
     6.6.3.2. A description of the action being taken, and the reason (be specific).
     6.6.3.3. The effective date, which must comply with the applicable advance notice period
     prescribed in paragraph 6.6.2.
     6.6.3.4. The position title, occupational series, grade or pay band, rate of pay, and
     employment category of the position being offered, if applicable.
     6.6.3.5. Advice on severance pay entitlement, if applicable (see paragraph 18.23)
     6.6.3.6. Advice on loss of benefits (insurance, retirement, annual or sick leave, etc.), if
     applicable.
     6.6.3.7. If the action is separation:
         6.6.3.7.1. A statement that the action is nondisciplinary and does not preclude
         reemployment.
         6.6.3.7.2. Information on the reemployment priority list (see paragraph 6.7.).

            6.6.3.7.3. Information on eligibility for civil service positions for one year from the
            date of separation under the terms of the DoD/OPM Interchange Agreement.
            6.6.3.7.4. Information on unemployment compensation.
        6.6.3.7.5. An explanation of the employee's right to appeal, including how and where to
        appeal, and the time limits for making such appeal.
        6.6.3.7.6. The name, location, and phone number of the person in the NAF-HR
        designated to provide assistance.
6.7. Remployment Priority Lists (RPL):
     6.7.1. Each NAF-HR servicing a NAF activity separating an employee by a BBA establishes
     an RPL to provide placement assistance to those separated by the BBA. Separated
     employees have priority placement rights in the NAF activity from which separated (e.g.,
     Officers' Club, bowling center, golf course), and priority consideration rights at other DoD
     NAF activities in the commuting area (100 mile radius). They are immediately placed on the
     RPL and remain on the RPL until reemployed, or until 1 year after the date of separation,
     whichever occurs first.
     6.7.2. A person on the RPL is offered employment in a vacant position in the NAF activity
     from which he or she was separated; and offered priority consideration for vacant NAF
     positions in other DoD NAF activities in the commuting area of the NAF activity from which
     separated if all of the following apply:
        6.7.2.1. Management is filling the vacancy by other than detail.
        6.7.2.2. The vacancy is in the same or lower employment category as the position from
        which the employee was separated.
        6.7.2.3. The vacancy is in the same or lower grade or pay band as the position from
        which the employee was separated.
        6.7.2.4. The vacancy has substantially the same duties as the position from which the
        employee was separated.
     6.7.3. Rehiring an individual on the RPL in the same NAF activity from which he or she was
     separated is a noncompetitive recruitment action. Therefore, such individuals are rehired
     before those who receive preference in the competitive recruitment process (e.g., military
     spouse preference, THP, etc.).
     6.7.4. An individual's name is removed from the RPL when he or she accepts an equivalent
     position (i.e., the same or higher employment category, the same or higher rate of basic pay,
     and the same or higher grade, or pay band) to the position from which separated. Positions
     with a limited term of 365 days or less are not considered an equivalent position. Declination
     of an offer of an equivalent position results in removal from the RPL.
     6.7.5. If the first person on the RPL declines or is otherwise removed from the RPL, the next
     eligible person on the RPL is offered the position, and so on until the RPL is exhausted.
     Placement and consideration is prioritized in the order of the date placed on the RPL. If such
     prioritization produces two or more applicants for placement or consideration placed on the
     RPL on the same date, they are referred simultaneously without any further prioritization.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                    77


   6.7.6. NAF-HRs provide a copy of the RPL to all DoD NAF personnel offices within the
   commuting area monthly.
   6.7.7. For base closures, a final RPL is prepared and issued 30 days prior to final closure of
   the base. The RPL is identified as the final RPL to be issued from that particular office.
   6.7.8. RPLs contain at a minimum: Identification of the servicing NAF-HR or NAF
   Personnel Office; the employee's name; the employment category, pay plan, series, grade,
   and position title of the position from which separated by BBA; the employee's rate of basic
   pay at the time of separation; the date the employee was placed on the RPL (the date of the
   separation); and the employee's address and telephone number at the time of separation.
   6.7.9. RPLs forwarded to other AF NAF-HRs within the commuting area have a current OF
   612, Optional Application for Federal Employment, attached for each employee added to the
   RPL during the preceding month.
6.8. LWOP for Career Program Employees:
   6.8.1. To avoid a break in service, NAF career program employees issued a 60-day notice of
   separation as a result of a BBA are placed on LWOP by the installation where employed at
   the end of the 60-day period, if they are on a priority referral certificate, pending results of
   the selection.
      6.8.1.1. NAF-HRs are notified by the NAF Career Program when an employee is on a
      priority referral certificate. If at the end of the 60-day notice period, a selection decision
      has not been made, the employee is placed on LWOP for a period not to exceed 30 days.
      6.8.1.2. If the employee is not selected for this position, or for another position before
      the expiration of the 30-day LWOP period, action is taken immediately to process the
      BBA separation.
   6.8.2. NAF career program employees who reach the expiration of the 60-day notice period,
   and who have not received a priority referral offer, may elect to be placed in LWOP status
   for a maximum of 30 days. If at the end of the 30-day LWOP period and the employee has
   not been selected for another position, action is immediately taken to process the BBA
   separation.
   6.8.3. The notice memorandum of separation under BBA procedures must include the
   information contained in paragraph 6.6.3, in addition to the following:
      6.8.3.1. Information on these LWOP procedures.
      6.8.3.2. Notification that it is their responsibility to request the 30-day LWOP if they
      have not received a priority referral offer by the expiration of the 60-day notice period.
      6.8.3.3. A statement that severance pay is not paid until after the LWOP period expires.
   6.8.4. NAF-HRs must counsel employees electing LWOP about their participation in the
   retirement and insurance programs while on LWOP.

                 PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS, INCENTIVE AWARDS

7.1. Performance Evaluation of Regular and Flexible Employees. All NAF employees must
be aware of what is expected of them in their current position. Supervisors identify work
performance standards and fairly and objectively evaluate the work performance of employees
under their supervision on a scheduled and continuous basis (semi-annually is required).
Supervisors ensure employees are aware of what their performance standards are, how
performance evaluations are performed, and the possible awards available for doing a superior
job.
     7.1.1. Performance Evaluation Objectives.         Objectives of the performance evaluation
     system are to:
        7.1.1.1. Keep employees aware of performance standards expected of them, in terms of
        quality and quantity of work to be performed and standards of personal conduct and
        behavior essential to their successful performance in the position.
        7.1.1.2. Provide employees with constructive help to identify and correct deficiencies in
        their performance or conduct, in order to help them achieve full potential in their
        positions.
        7.1.1.3. Identify and resolve points of misunderstanding between supervisors and
        employees regarding work requirements.
        7.1.1.4. Evaluate employees fairly and objectively on a scheduled and continuous basis
        with the results of the evaluation discussed individually with each employee.
        7.1.1.5. Increase the efficiency of employees and supervisors.
        7.1.1.6. Develop constructive relationships between supervisors and employees.
        7.1.1.7. Advise employees on whether they meet, fail to meet, or exceed the standards
        for satisfactory performance.
        7.1.1.8. Evaluate employees only under reasonable standards that are in effect during the
        rating period, are known to the employee, and that the employee has had a fair
        opportunity to meet.
        7.1.1.9. Use performance evaluations as a basis for making decisions on training,
        retention, promotion, reassignment, removal, and other personnel actions.
     7.1.2. Performance Standards. Performance standards prescribe the quality, quantity, and
     timeliness of job performance essential for fully satisfactory performance in a specific
     position. Performance standards must clearly apprise the employee of the minimum standard
     of performance required and must be reasonable, sufficient in the circumstances to permit
     accurate measurement of performance, and adequate to inform the employee of what is
     necessary to achieve an acceptable performance rating. Standards are defined in measurable,
     realistic, and reasonable terms for those major tasks and functions specified for the position.
     They represent a level a competent employee can expect to achieve. The need for specific
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              79


  standards and a common understanding of them is particularly important during an
  employee's probationary period.
     7.1.2.1. First line supervisors will:
        7.1.2.1.1. Develop performance standards, in writing, on the PG for each position
        supervised.
        7.1.2.1.2. Continuously evaluate employee's performance.
        7.1.2.1.3. Acquaint each employee with the performance rating system and the
        performance standards pertinent to the employee's position upon appointment to a
        new position, and during the performance evaluation meeting.
        7.1.2.1.4. Informally discuss with the employee from time to time the degree to
        which the employee meets, fails to meet, or exceeds the standards.
        7.1.2.1.5. Counsel employees on how to become more effective members of the
        team.
        7.1.2.1.6. Complete annual performance evaluations, and provide a copy to the
        employee. Additionally, a midterm feedback is required.
        7.1.2.1.7. Evaluate employees serving a probationary period, and recommend
        retention or separation.
        7.1.2.1.8. Prepare justification to support outstanding and less than satisfactory
        ratings.
        7.1.2.1.9. Initiate memorandums of warning and decision memorandums for
        unsatisfactory performance.
        7.1.2.1.10. Initiate proposals for performance awards.
     7.1.2.2. Establish performance standards for each major duty essential to successful
     performance. Standards indicate the quality of satisfactory performance for a specific
     position. Standards must be reasonable and of such a nature an employee meeting the
     minimum qualification standards for the position can expect to perform satisfactorily
     within a reasonable time after assignment to the position. Standards must be sufficiently
     high to assure an efficient operation, but not so high outstanding performance is beyond
     the achievement of a competent employee.
     7.1.2.3. Establish performance standards for any or all of the following aspects of a
     position. The aspects listed are not all-inclusive and some may merit greater weight than
     others for a particular position. They are not mutually exclusive; e.g., the quantity of
     work cannot be completely separated from the ability to organize and schedule work.
     Supervisors should add to the following list any aspects pertinent to a position and
     eliminate any which do not apply:
        7.1.2.3.1. Quality of finished work
        7.1.2.3.2. Quantity of work
        7.1.2.3.3. Adaptability to new assignments and to changes in instructions, work
        methods, work situations, organization, or staff

           7.1.2.3.9. Leadership and initiative
           7.1.2.3.10. Ability to use professional, technical, mechanical, clerical, or supervisory
           knowledge and skills pertinent to the position
           7.1.2.3.11. Courtesy to the public for jobs in which dealing with the public is
           important
           7.1.2.3.12. For supervisors, furthering EEO is an essential element of performance.
           Factors to be included in performance evaluation for EEO include:
               7.1.2.3.12.1. Personal      participation   in   EEO    program      leadership   and
               administration
               7.1.2.3.12.2. Fairness in making selections
               7.1.2.3.12.3. Encouragement and recognition of employee achievements
               7.1.2.3.12.4. Treatment of minority group employees and women
               7.1.2.3.12.5. Training and upward mobility

        stewardship of this responsibility as an essential element of performance
        7.1.2.5. Performance standards for managers include internal control responsibilities.
        The internal control-related content of performance standards must be tailored to their
        relative importance and other circumstances associated with each manager.
        7.1.2.6. For activity manager positions, include success of the total operation in terms of
        customer satisfaction, participation and interest, profitability of operations, and financial
        management and compliance with applicable policies, regulations, laws and standards.
     7.1.3. Performance Evaluation Process:
        7.1.3.1. Annual Evaluations. The annual performance evaluation cycle is 1 October
        through 30 September of each year. Performance evaluations are completed at the same
        time on all employees, both regular and flexible. Employees with less than 90 days of
        employment are not evaluated until they have completed at least 90 days. Each
        installation establishes local policy regarding 90-day evaluations of new employees. If
        the employee’s supervisor leaves within 90 days of the closeout period, supervisor
        completes the employee’s evaluation prior to departure. If the employee’s supervisor
        leaves prior to 90 days of the closeout period, the gaining supervisor completes an
        evaluation after 90 days of supervision. Evaluations are completed on AF Form 3527,
        NAF Employee Performance Evaluation. The AF Form 3527 requires a rater and a
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                81


     reviewing official. The squadron commander or director determines the level of the
     reviewing official, but it must be at least one supervisory level above the rating official
     (who is the first level supervisor).
     7.1.3.2. Salary Review – Pay band Employees. Supervisors must review an
     employee's salary in conjunction with the annual evaluation to ensure the employee is
     being compensated commensurate with his or her duties and level of performance.
     7.1.3.3. Awards – All Employees. Performance awards to recognize employees are
     recommended and processed according to the guidance in paragraph 7.2.
  7.1.4. Declining Work Performance. Declining work performance occurs when the
  employee is not performing all requirements of the position in a manner acceptable to the
  supervisor. Prior to assigning a less than satisfactory performance evaluation, the supervisor
  must advise the employee with a written warning regarding his or her work performance
  deficiencies. Written warnings may also be issued at other times during the evaluation cycle.
  Employees with performance deficiencies should be made aware of these deficiencies as
  soon as they occur, so that they have a minimum of 90 days to correct the deficiencies.
  Discussions about performance that may be used as a basis for issuing a written warning
  about performance should be documented in the AF Form 971. The supervisor must also
  provide reasonable assistance to help the employee improve.
     7.1.4.1. Early counseling regarding declining work performance must include the
     following:
         7.1.4.1.1. Supervisors must be able to express in which performance standard the
         employee’s performance is falling short or has become unacceptable.
         7.1.4.1.2. Employees must be informed of examples of their poor performance and
         explanations of what is wrong with their work.
         7.1.4.1.3. Supervisors must be able to explain how the work will be done correctly
         and must make their expectations clear.
         7.1.4.1.4. Supervisors should encourage employee participation in the discussion as a
         means of discovering the cause of the employee’s performance difficulties.
         7.1.4.1.5. Supervisors must summarize their comments in writing and provide the
         employee with a copy of the summary.
     7.1.4.2. Written Warning. The written warning is prepared by the supervisor, reviewed
     by the next level supervisor, and coordinated through the NAF-HR before issuing to the
     employee. The written notice includes:
         7.1.4.2.1. A statement explaining the employee's deficiencies.     Relate the
         performance deficiencies to the performance standards of the position, and be
         specific. Include the language of the performance standard in the performance
         improvement period notice. Include examples of performance deficiencies to
         demonstrate what constitutes unacceptable performance.
         7.1.4.2.2. A statement explaining assistance will be provided to help the employee
         meet his or her performance standards. State the specific assistance which will be
         provided (e.g., training, if appropriate). Make the supervisor’s role clear concerning
82                                                   AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


        how the employee should seek help. NOTE: Formal training is not a requirement
        when providing an opportunity to improve.
        7.1.4.2.3. A statement the employee will be given a performance improvement
        period of not less than 30 days (in the case of a regular employee), or not less than 7
        days (in the case of a flexible employee) to meet his or her performance standards.
        7.1.4.2.4. A statement explaining the employee will be reassigned, demoted, or
        separated if he or she fails to meet the performance standards within the applicable
        performance improvement period.
        7.1.4.2.5. A statement explaining how the supervisor will monitor performance.
        7.1.4.2.6. The notice will explain how the supervisor addressed an employee request
        for reasonable accommodation, if any such request was made. If reasonable
        accommodation was made, the notice should explain how that may impact on the
        opportunity to improve, if at all.
     7.1.4.3. Expiration of the Performance Improvement Period. At the end of the
     performance improvement period, the supervisor determines success or failure. If the
     employee has successfully improved to the acceptable level, the employee will be
     provided with written notification. If the employee's performance remains unacceptable,
     the supervisor must take appropriate action to either:
        7.1.4.3.1. Reassign the employee (regular or flexible) to another position within the
        organization.
        7.1.4.3.2. Prepare written notification to terminate the employee (flexible only).
        7.1.4.3.3. Prepare a notice of proposed demotion or a notice of proposed removal
        (regular only).
     7.1.4.4. Reassignment. If the supervisor decides to reassign the employee, the
     employee is advised of the reasons the action is being taken. The supervisor prepares an
     AF Form 2548 and forwards it to the NAF-HR, who in turn processes and issues an AF
     Form 2545, documenting the reassignment. Use reassignments for both flexible and
     regular employees.
     7.1.4.5. Termination of Flexible Employees. If the supervisor decides to terminate a
     flexible employee, the supervisor notifies the employee in writing. The employee is
     provided advance notification of at least 24 hours. The Notice of Termination is prepared
     and signed by the supervisor. The supervisor will enlist the assistance of the NAF-HR in
     the preparation of the memorandum. The memorandum must be hand-delivered or
     otherwise provided to the employee, or a diligent effort to make delivery must be made
     and documented. The Notice of Termination must be reviewed by the NAF-HR before
     issuing to the employee. It includes the following:
        7.1.4.5.1. A statement of the action in specific terms, for example, "I have decided to
        terminate you from AF NAF employment."
        7.1.4.5.2. A statement identifying both the specific instances of unacceptable
        performance by the employee on which the action is based, and the performance
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  83


        standards of the employee's position involved in each instance of unacceptable
        performance.
        7.1.4.5.3. The effective date of the action. The effective date is not earlier than 24
        hours from the date the employee receives the Notice of Termination.
        7.1.4.5.4. A statement the employee has the right to respond to the Notice of
        Termination, in writing, and identification of the person designated to receive the
        response.
        7.1.4.5.5. A statement that any response must be received by the designated official,
        either:
            7.1.4.5.5.1. Prior to the effective date of this action (if the notice period given is
            24 hours), or
            7.1.4.5.5.2. Not later than 24 hours prior to the effective date of the action (if

        issued.
        7.1.4.6.11. The name, location, and phone number of the person in the NAF-HR
        designated to provide assistance to the employee.
     7.1.4.7. Notice of Decision. The supervisor issues a Notice of Decision to the employee
     regardless of whether or not the employee's response to the Notice of Proposed Action
     was received, or even if a decision is made to cancel the proposed action or take a lesser
     action than originally proposed (e.g., reassignment). The supervisor prepares and signs
     the Notice of Decision. Supervisors will enlist the assistance of the NAF-HR in the
     preparation of the Notice of Decision. The memorandum is hand-delivered or otherwise
     provided to the employee on or before the date the action is to be effective, or a diligent
     effort to make delivery is made and documented. The Notice of Decision is clearly

        the decision are the reasons which were cited in the Notice of Proposed Action. The
        Notice of Decision may not introduce any new allegations of unacceptable
        performance. The Notice must reflect consideration of the employee’s response, if
        one was made.
        7.1.4.7.3. The effective date of the action.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  85

          and where to grieve, and the time limits for submitting the grievance. If the employee
          is a member of a bargaining unit subject to negotiated grievance procedures, the
          employee follows procedures in the negotiated agreement.
       7.1.4.8. Documentation. The NAF-HR maintains the material used to support the
       action, the proposed notice and the decision memorandum, along with the employee's
       response (if applicable), in a separate file apart from the employee's OPF. Subject to the
       provisions of the Privacy Act, the case file is made available for review upon request only
       by an affected employee or by those whose official duties require access. The original
       decision memorandum is given to the employee, and a copy is filed on the right side of
       the employee's OPF. Supervisors prepare an AF Form 2548, documenting the action, and
       forward to the NAF-HR for processing. The NAF-HR processes the form, and issues an
       AF Form 2545.
   7.1.5. Resolving Evaluation Dissatisfactions. An employee dissatisfied with his or her
   assigned performance evaluation may submit a grievance for resolution under the grievance
   procedures.
7.2. Incentive Awards. NAF employees play an important part in the effective and economical
operation of the activity, and should be recognized for exceptional and noteworthy performance.
All NAF employees are eligible for consideration for various types of cash awards.
   7.2.1. Supervisors will use a systematic procedure to acknowledge better than expected
   performance. Providing quick and appropriate recognition for good effort enhances morale
   and contributes to productivity of the work force.
   7.2.2. The commander or director ensures activity managers budget for awards. All activity
   managers must be aware of how they may use the award money.

     are given during the annual performance evaluation cycle of each year. The supervisor
     initiates the award on AF Form 1001, Award Recommendation Transmittal, and forwards
     through the activity manager and flight chief to the FSS commander or director for
     approval. Justification is entered on the AF Form 1001. The NAF-HR inputs the award
     into DCPDS to generate an AF Form 2545, which is retained in the employee's OPF.
     Prepare a separate AF Form 2545 for each approved performance award using NOA
     N840, Individual Cash Award.
     7.2.4.2. Special Act or Service Awards. A special act or service award may be given to
     an employee for a specific event that results in a unique contribution to the organization
     above and beyond the scope of assigned duties. The amount of the award is determined
     by the actual dollar savings, or intangible benefits. The supervisor completes AF Form
     1001, and forwards through the activity manager and flight chief to the FSS commander
     or director for approval for amount not exceeding $2,000. Justification is entered on the
     AF Form 1001. The mission support group commander approves awards of $2,001 up to
     $10,000. The NAF-HR inputs the award into the DCPDS to generate an AF Form 2545,
     which is retained in the employee's OPF. Prepare a separate AF Form 2545 for each
     approved performance award using NOA N840.
     7.2.4.3. On-The-Spot Cash Awards. An on-the-spot cash award may be given to an
     employee for a specific event or situation that results in a unique contribution to the
     activity or organization. The maximum of the award is limited to $250. There is no limit
     to the number of such awards that may be granted to an employee. The supervisor
     initiates AF Form 1001 and forwards to the appropriate approval authority. If
     justification is required, it is entered on the AF Form 1001. Approval for this award
     should be delegated at the lowest level deemed appropriate by the commander or director.
     The NAF-HR inputs the award into DCPDS to generate an AF Form 2545, which is
     retained in the employee's OPF. Prepare a separate AF Form 2545 for each approved
     performance award using NOA N840.
     7.2.4.4. Service Recognition. This award reflects recognition of long and faithful
     service. Use Federal service certificates and pins for all such awards. (See AFI 36-1004,
     The Air Force Civilian Recognition Program) Give recognition to regular employees for
     5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 years of creditable service. Creditable federal service includes
     all APF and NAF civilian service, and all honorable military service, which are creditable
     for leave. Creditable NAF service includes regular service with any DoD NAFI. A
     certificate is given for 5 years of service (AF Form 3033, Certificate of Appreciation).
     Use AF APF certificates and pins for all others. Present AF Form 342, Retirement
     Certificate of Civilian Service, to an employee on retirement. The mission support group
     commander or a designated representative signs the AF Form 342. Approval levels for
     service awards are described in table 7.1.
     7.2.4.5. Honorary Awards. NAF employees may receive honorary awards according to
     and as described in AFI 36-1004. These awards include the Air Force Civilian
     Achievement Medal, Command or Air Force Civilian Award for Valor, Exemplary

     where applicable, for honorary awards are the responsibility of the recommending NAF
     activity.
     7.2.4.6. Special Employee Recognition Programs. Each installation is encouraged to
     establish special employee recognition programs (for example, employee of the month or
     employee of the year awards), if funds are available. Special awards are funded by the
     NAFI that employs the recipient. The NAF-HR inputs the award into the DCPDS to
     generate an AF Form 2545, which is retained in the employee's OPF. Prepare a separate
     AF Form 2545 for each approved performance award using NOA N840.
     7.2.4.7. Memorandums of Commendation. These commend employees for superior
     work performance, special acts, contributions, or special service, which clearly exceed
     what is normally expected, while on special assignment or during a short emergency type
     situation. These memorandums are issued and signed by any supervisor or management
     official.
  7.2.5. Processing Awards. All incentive awards are processed through the NAF-HR.
  Completed and approved forms are forwarded to the NAF-HR for processing through
  DCPDS and the NAF payroll system.

AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 89


7.3. Time Off Incentive Awards. Time off awards are an alternate means of recognizing the
superior accomplishments of employees with other monetary or non-monetary awards.
Decisions to grant time off awards should be based upon the same criteria or circumstances as
for any other incentive award. Time off awards are not granted to create the effect of a holiday
or treated as administrative excusals or leave, e.g. they are not granted in conjunction with a
military "down" or "training" day or the like which would grant the entire civilian employee
population, or a majority of the civilian population, a time off award to be used on a specified
day. Though time off awards do not have immediate budget consequence, supervisors and
managers shall consider full wage costs and productivity loss when granting time off awards and
shall ensure that the amount of time off granted as an award is commensurate with the
individual’s contribution or accomplishment.
   7.3.1. Time Off Award Determination and Approval. Time off from duty, called a time
   off award, may be granted, without loss of pay or charge to leave, in recognition of superior
   accomplishment or other personal effort that contributes to the quality, efficiency, or
   economy of operations. The authority to approve time off awards is delegated to the
   commander or director who may further delegate this authority no lower than the flight chief.
       7.3.1.1. Supervisors may approve time off awards of no more than one working day
       without review and approval of a higher official. Complete all documentation and
       processing requirements. Officials who exercise personnel appointing authority may
       approve time-off awards in excess of one working day. They may delegate this authority
       to officials who approve recommendations for other incentive awards. Designate these
       officials in local operating instructions.
   7.3.2. Eligibility Criteria. A time off award is granted in recognition of superior
   accomplishment or other personal effort which contributes to the quality, efficiency, or
   economy of operations. A time off award does not replace existing cash or honorary awards.
   It is used principally to recognize contributions that are of a one time, nonrecurring nature.
   In determining the amount of time off award, consideration is given to the cost in lost
   production time and the benefits realized by the AF from the employee's contributions.
   Recommending and reviewing/approving officials at the organization level also consider
   other available forms of recognition and cash awards and are consistent in
   recommending/approving time off award amounts. Examples of achievements considered
   for a time off award are:
       7.3.2.1. Making a high quality contribution involving a difficult or important project or
       assignment.
       7.3.2.2. Displaying special initiative and skill in completing an assignment or project
       before the deadline.
       7.3.2.3. Using initiative and creativity in making improvements in a product, activity,
       program or service.
       7.3.2.4. Ensuring the mission of the activity is accomplished during a difficult period by
       successfully completing additional work or a project assignment while maintaining the
       employee's own workload.
90                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


        7.3.2.5. Accomplishing a specific, onetime, or special assignment requiring extra effort
        or resulting in the activity receiving recognition for responsiveness to unprogrammed
        requirements.
        7.3.2.6. Participating in a quality circle or process action/improvement team resulting in
        the implementation of significantly improved work processes or products.
        7.3.2.7. Submitting a suggestion that is adopted, but because the suggestion is considered
        to be within the employee's normal job responsibilities, the employee is not eligible for a
        cash award.
     7.3.3. Limitations on Time Off Awards:
        7.3.3.1. Employees working a typical 80-hour pay period may be awarded a total time
        off of 80 hours during any leave year. For employees who work less than 40 hours per
        week, the total time that may be granted during any calendar year is the average number
        of hours of work in the employee’s biweekly scheduled tour of duty over the previous
        six-month period. The maximum award for any single contribution is one-half the
        maximum amount of time that can be granted during the year.
        7.3.3.2. The maximum amount of time off that may be granted for any single
        contribution is 40 hours. For employees who work less than 40 hours per week, the
        maximum award for any single contribution is one-half the maximum amount of time
        that could be granted during the year.
        7.3.3.3. Time off approved as an award is scheduled and used to the extent possible
        within ninety calendar days from the effective date of the award. Time off not used
        within one year from the effective date is forfeited with no further right to restoration.
        7.3.3.4. Time off is granted and scheduled so as not to adversely affect an employee who
        is in an annual leave "use or lose" situation and is not used as justification to restore
        forfeited annual leave.
        7.3.3.5. Under 5 CFR 451.104, a time off award does not convert to cash under any
        circumstances.
        7.3.3.6. Approved time off not used at the time an employee transfers between DoD
        components cannot be transferred. In order to avoid the loss of the time off, every effort
        should be made to allow the employee to use the time off before the transfer.
     7.3.4. Documentation. All time off awards are supported by appropriate written
     justification. Approved time off awards are submitted to the NAF-HR for processing at least
     seven workdays in advance of the proposed effective date and include the following
     information:
        7.3.4.1. Employee name, social security number, and NAFI.
        7.3.4.2. Number of hours of time off granted.
        7.3.4.3. Justification briefly explaining how the employee met one or more of the criteria
        contained in paragraph 7.3.2.
        7.3.4.4. Certification from the supervisor or recommending official of the following:
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                    91


"I have considered the cost of this time off award in lost production time and have determined
the benefits realized by the AF from the employee's contributions support the amount of time off
approved. I have also considered the activity workload and activity employee leave projections
and certify that this employee will be able to schedule the time off in addition to other projected
leave no later than ___________ (date not to exceed 90 days from submission of the time off
award for approval, if possible; otherwise, not to exceed one year). I have also considered other
available forms of recognition and cash awards in determining the amount of time off award."
       7.3.4.5. Name, position title, signature and date signed by recommending official.
       7.3.4.6. Name, position title, signature and date signed by reviewing official (if
       applicable), and approving official.
       7.3.4.7. Use an AF Form 1001 to provide the information required by paragraph 7.3.4.
       The justification and certification statement are entered on the AF Form 1001. After the
       award is approved, it is forwarded to the NAF-HR for processing. The NAF-HR inputs
       the award into the DCPDS to generate an AF Form 2545, which is retained in the
       employee's OPF. Prepare a separate AF Form 2545 for each time off award approved
       using NOA N891, Time off Award. Time off award personnel actions are effected within
       seven workdays after receipt from the official with time off award approving authority.
       Send a copy of the AF Form 2545 to the originator and to the employee as confirmation
       that the time off is approved and processed.
   7.3.5. Processing a Group Award. Follow all procedures outlined in paragraphs 7.3.1
   through 7.3.4. All documentation outlined in paragraph 7.3.4 must be provided, however, it
   may be submitted as follows:
       7.3.5.1. Prepare only one AF Form 1001. Annotate Blocks three and four to read "see
       attached listing." The listing reflects: name, social security number, present position,
       title, grade, step and salary, and number of hours granted for each employee entitled to
       receive the award. In some cases, there may be employees who are on extended leave,
       LWOP, Workers' Compensation, or experiencing performance problems who are not
       eligible for the award. Review the list carefully to ensure eligibility.            The
       supervisor/recommending official signs at the bottom of the list.
       7.3.5.2. Prepare only one narrative justification and certification for signature of the
       supervisor/recommending official.
       7.3.5.3. Send the AF Form 1001, with the attached listing and justification to the NAF-
       HR upon approval. The NAF-HR processes the award in accordance with paragraph
       7.3.4.7. Send a copy of the AF Form 2545 to each employee, and file a copy in each
       employee's OPF.
   7.3.6. Time and Attendance Reporting and Scheduling Time Off:
       7.3.6.1. Record approval and use of time off on employee time and attendance reports in
       accordance with instructions published by the NAF payroll office.
       7.3.6.2. The employee is responsible for requesting supervisory approval to schedule and
       use the time off award. Employee requests to use time off are submitted far enough in
       advance to permit its use without undue interruption to the work of the activity.

        7.3.6.3. Time off is not used and recorded on time and attendance reports until
        documentation, approval and processing requirements are completed. The AF Form
        2545 serves as confirmation that the time off award has been approved and processed.
        Time off is not scheduled prior to receipt of the AF Form 2545.
7.4. Innovative Development Through Employee Awareness Program (IDEA) Programs.
     7.4.1. Employees are encouraged to suggest improvements resulting in tangible and
     intangible benefits. Employees submit suggestions to approving officials using the forms
     prescribed in AFI 38401, The Air Force Innovative Development Through Employee
     Awareness (IDEA) Program.
     7.4.2. Send a certificate and memorandum to the employee in recognition of an approved
     suggestion and file a copy of the memorandum as a long-term document in the employee's
     OPF. Record the approved suggestion on the Supervisor's Record of Employee.
     7.4.3. Each installation prepares an operating instruction (OI) that includes procedures for
     review, approval and criteria for determining when cash awards for suggestions are used.

                                           Chapter 8

                                 DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS

8.1. Purpose:
   8.1.1. Managers and supervisors set reasonable standards of conduct and maintain a
   constructive, disciplined work environment in which employees recognize and carry out their
   responsibilities and comply with the standards of conduct.
   8.1.2. Take disciplinary action only when necessary and then promptly and fairly. The
   purpose of disciplinary action is to correct and rehabilitate the employee. Discipline must be
   applied as consistently as possible. Considering the circumstances, like penalties are
   imposed for like offenses. The seriousness of the offense determines the type of disciplinary
   action necessary. Use the table of offenses and typical penalties at Attachment 9 as a guide
   for determining an appropriate penalty.
   8.1.3. Disciplinary actions are personal matters and are administered in private.
   8.1.4. The servicing NAF-HR reviews memorandums of reprimand, notices of termination,
   notices of proposed action, and decision memorandums before issuing to the employee to
   ensure that these memorandums are procedurally correct and proper on merit. Supervisors
   will solicit NAF-HR assistance in preparing disciplinary action memorandums.
   8.1.5. NAF-HRs should coordinate proposed notice memorandums and will coordinate
   decision memorandums required for suspensions, demotions, and removals with the base
   legal office before issuing.
   8.1.6. Do not use suspension and removal actions to discipline flexible employees.
8.2. Disciplinary Actions. A disciplinary action is an action taken by management to correct an
employee's delinquency or misconduct.
   8.2.1. Disciplinary actions include:
An oral admonishment

A memorandum of reprimand

A termination (flexible employees only)

A suspension (regular employees only)

A removal (regular employees only)

In some cases, a demotion (reduction in grade or pay band) (regular employees only)
   8.2.2. Disciplinary actions do not include:
       8.2.2.1. Application of a revised prevailing rate schedule when there is no change to the
       position
       8.2.2.2. A BBA.
94                                                       AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


        8.2.2.3. A reduction in the number of guaranteed hours that does not result in a change in
        the employee's employment category.
        8.2.2.4. An action taken against an employee serving a probationary period.
        8.2.2.5. A change in duty shifts that result in the loss of differentials or premium pay.
        8.2.2.6. An action taken as the result of the termination of a temporary promotion.
        8.2.2.7. A resignation, change to lower grade or pay band, or reduction in pay or hours
        when voluntarily initiated by the employee.
     8.2.3. Oral Admonishment. An oral admonishment is a discussion between a supervisor
     and an employee during which the supervisor informs the employee that he or she is being
     disciplined by an oral admonishment. It is the least severe disciplinary action and is used to
     correct misconduct or delinquency and to motivate an employee to improve work habits,
     work methods, or behavior. Use it to discipline either a regular or flexible employee.
        8.2.3.1. The supervisor advises the employee of what he or she did wrong, when he or
        she did it, and the surrounding circumstances. The supervisor gives the employee an
        opportunity to explain his or her actions.
        8.2.3.2. To be most effective, an oral admonishment is conducted soon after the incident-
        giving rise to the admonishment, in private, and in an informal manner.
        8.2.3.3. There is no formal procedure required to effect an oral admonishment. On the
        date of the admonishment, the supervisor must make a notation, in pencil, on the AF
        Form 971, (DCPDS generated) which includes the words "oral admonishment", the
        effective date, and a notation that the employee has been advised of the admonishment.
        The employee may be asked to initial the AF Form 971 entry. The employee's initials do
        not indicate agreement with the entry content, but only awareness of the entry. This
        notation is deleted two years after the date of the admonishment.
     8.2.4. Memorandum of Reprimand. A Memorandum of Reprimand is a formal
     disciplinary memorandum issued by a supervisor to an employee. It is used to correct
     significant misconduct or delinquency or repeated lesser offenses, and may be the last step in
     a progression toward suspension or removal. It will give clear warning that subsequent
     misconduct could result in more severe disciplinary action, including removal. Use it to
     discipline either a regular or flexible employee.
        8.2.4.1. Before issuing a Memorandum of Reprimand, the supervisor meets with the
        employee, tells the employee that he or she is considering a Memorandum of Reprimand
        due to the employee's misconduct; tells the employee the specific nature of the
        misconduct, including date, time, and place; and gives the employee an opportunity to
        explain his or her actions. After meeting with the employee, the supervisor may decide
        to take no action, orally admonish the employee (see paragraph 8.2.3), or issue a
        Memorandum of Reprimand. The supervisor makes a memo of what is said during the
        meeting with the employee.
        8.2.4.2. If the supervisor believes that a Memorandum of Reprimand is warranted, the
        supervisor prepares it. It is clearly identified with the subject: "Memorandum of
        Reprimand", and includes the following:
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 95


        8.2.4.2.1. A statement, "The purpose of this memorandum is to officially reprimand
        you for your conduct on _____(date)_____."
        8.2.4.2.2. The specific reason for the action, including the date, time, and place of the
        alleged misconduct.
        8.2.4.2.3. A statement that further misconduct could result in more severe
        disciplinary action, including removal.
        8.2.4.2.4. A statement that a copy of the Memorandum of Reprimand is placed in the
        employee's OPF for a period of 2 years.
        8.2.4.2.5. A statement that the employee has a right to file a grievance in accordance
        with the provisions of Chapter 9, or the negotiated grievance procedure, whichever is
        applicable.
     8.2.4.3. The supervisor ensures the NAF-HR reviews the memorandum before issuing to
     the employee. After NAF-HR review, the supervisor gives the original copy of the
     memorandum to the employee.
     8.2.4.4. The supervisor makes a note of the Memorandum of Reprimand, in pencil, on
     the employee's AF Form 971, files a copy with the employee's AF Form 971, and gives a
     copy to the NAF-HR for filing in the employee's OPF. This note is deleted and the
     copies removed and destroyed 2 years after the date of the memorandum.
  8.2.5. Termination. Management initiates involuntary termination to separate a flexible
  employee from AF NAF employment. It is the most severe form of disciplinary action for
  the flexible employee.
     8.2.5.1. If the supervisor decides to terminate a flexible employee, the supervisor notifies
     the employee in writing. The employee is provided advance notification of at least 24
     hours. The supervisor prepares and signs the Notice of Termination. The supervisor will
     enlist the assistance of the NAF-HR in the preparation of the memorandum. The
     memorandum is hand delivered by the supervisor or otherwise provided the employee on
     or before the date the action is to be effective, or a diligent effort to make delivery is
     made and documented. The NAF-HR reviews the Notice of Termination before issuing
     to the employee.
     8.2.5.2. The Notice of Termination includes the following:
        8.2.5.2.1. A statement of the action in specific terms, for example, "I have decided to
        terminate you from AF NAF employment."
        8.2.5.2.2. A specific statement of the date, time, and place of the alleged misconduct.
        8.2.5.2.3. The effective date of the action (the effective date may not be earlier than
        24 hours from the date the employee receives the Notice of Termination).
        8.2.5.2.4. A statement that the employee has the right to respond to the Notice of
        Termination, in writing, and identification of the person designated to receive the
        response.
        8.2.5.2.5. A statement that any response must be received by the official designated
        in the memo either: prior to the effective date of this action (if the notice period
96                                                        AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


            given is twenty-four hours); or not later than twenty-four hours prior to the effective
            date of the action (if more than twenty-four hours notice is given).
            8.2.5.2.6. A statement that nonreceipt of response, or a response that does not affect
            the proposed action, will result in the action taking place on the effective date stated.
            8.2.5.2.7. A statement that if a timely response results in a decision not to proceed,
            the action will not be taken or it will be reversed, whichever is applicable.
            8.2.5.2.8. An explanation of the employee's right to file a grievance, including how
            and where to file, and the time limits for filing. If the employee is a member of a
            bargaining unit subject to a negotiated grievance procedure, the employee follows
            that procedure.
            8.2.5.2.9. The name, location, and phone number of the person in the NAF-HR
            designated to provide assistance to the employee.
        8.2.5.3. Give the original copy of the Notice of Termination to the employee, make a
        note of the termination on the employee's AF Form 971, file a copy of the memorandum
        with the AF Form 971, and give a copy of the memorandum to the NAF-HR for filing in
        the employee's OPF. The supervisor prepares AF Form 2548, and forwards it to the
        NAF-HR. The NAF-HR prepares and issues an AF Form 2545.
     8.2.6. Suspension. A suspension is an action that involuntarily places a regular employee in
     a nonpay, nonduty status. A significant disciplinary action, it is ordinarily the final step in
     the disciplinary process before removal action is taken, and is accompanied by a warning to
     the employee that further misconduct could result in removal. Express periods of suspension
     in calendar days. Follow the procedures prescribed in paragraph 8.3 to suspend an employee.
     Do not use suspensions to discipline a flexible employee.
     8.2.7. Removal. A removal is an involuntary separation of a regular employee from AF
     NAF employment. It is the most severe form of disciplinary action. Normally, removal for
     misconduct is preceded by a progression of disciplinary measures unless the misconduct is so
     serious or the violation of rules and regulations so flagrant that removal for a first or second
     offense is warranted. Follow the procedures prescribed in paragraph 8.3 to remove an
     employee. Do not use removals to discipline flexible employees.
     8.2.8. Demotion (Reduction in Grade or Pay band). A demotion is a reduction in a
     regular employee's grade or pay band. It is imposed as a disciplinary action resulting from an
     employee's misconduct. Follow the procedures prescribed in paragraph 8.3 to demote an
     employee. Do not use demotions to discipline flexible employees.
8.3. Disciplinary Action Procedures for Suspensions, Removals, and Demotions. If a
supervisor proposes to either suspend, remove, or demote a regular employee, he or she adheres
to the following procedures (i.e., he or she presents the employee with a Notice of Proposed
Action, gives the employee an opportunity to respond to the proposal, and then presents the
employee with a Notice of Decision).
     8.3.1. Notice of Proposed Action. The purpose of this notice is to give the employee notice
     of the charges on which the proposed action is based, a brief explanation of the evidence
     supporting the charges, and an opportunity to present reasons why the proposed action should
     not be taken. The supervisor prepares and signs the Notice of Proposed Action. Supervisors
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  97


  will enlist the assistance of the NAF-HR in the preparation of the Notice Memorandum. The
  Notice of Proposed Action is clearly identified with the subject: "Notice of Proposed
  (Suspension/Removal/Demotion)," is reviewed by the NAF-HR, and will be reviewed by the
  base legal office before issuing to the employee. It includes the following:
     8.3.1.1. A statement, "The purpose of this memorandum is to notify you that I propose
     (to suspend you from duty, without pay, for a period of _____ calendar days) (to remove
     you from NAF employment) (to demote you from ___________ to _____________)."
     8.3.1.2. The specific reason for the proposed action, including a specific statement of the
     date, time, and place of the alleged misconduct.
     8.3.1.3. A statement of the employee's right to review the material relied on to support
     the proposed action.

  of whether or not management receives an employee's response to the notice of proposed
  action, or even if a decision is made to cancel the proposed action or take a lesser action than
  originally proposed. The supervisor prepares and signs the Notice of Decision. Supervisors
  will enlist the assistance of the NAF-HR in the preparation of the Notice of Decision. The
  memorandum is hand-delivered or otherwise provided to the employee on or before the date
  the action is to be effective, or a diligent effort to make delivery is made and documented.
  The Notice of Decision is clearly identified with the subject: "Notice of Decision", and is
  reviewed by the NAF-HR and the base legal office before issuing to the employee. It
  includes the following:

        originally proposed however, it cannot impose a greater penalty than that which was
        originally proposed.
        8.3.2.2. The specific reason for the decision. The only reason cited as a basis for the

          8.3.3.3.4. A reduction may also be made if there is reasonable cause to believe the
          employee has committed a crime for which a prison sentence may be imposed.
   8.3.4. Documentation. The NAF-HR maintains the material used to support any
   disciplinary action beyond an oral admonishment in a case file apart from the employee's
   OPF. The documentation must be sufficient to support the action, and may include copies of
   AF Form 971, training documentation, and previous disciplinary actions for similar incidents
   within two years. Information in the case file should be filed in chronological order, and in
   such a manner to provide a clear picture of the actions taken. If the action taken is a removal,
   or termination, a copy of the AF Form 2548 and AF Form 2545 should be filed in the case
   file. Subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act, the case file is made available for review,
   upon request only by the employee and their representative, or by those whose official duties
   require access.
       8.3.4.1. If the Notice of Decision imposes a lesser penalty than was in the Notice of
       Proposed Action, and if that penalty is:
          8.3.4.1.1. An oral admonishment, the supervisor gives the original copy of the Notice
          of Decision to the employee and makes a note of the admonishment, in pencil, on the
          employee's AF Form 971. A copy of the Notice of Decision is not filed with the
          employee's AF Form 971, nor is it filed in the employee's OPF. The note on the
          employee's AF Form 971 is deleted two years after the date of the memorandum.
          8.3.4.1.2. A reprimand, the supervisor gives the original copy of the Notice of
          Decision to the employee; makes a note of the reprimand, in pencil, on the
          employee's AF Form 971; files a copy of the memorandum with the employee's AF
          Form 971; and gives a copy of the memorandum to the NAF-HR for filing in the
          employee's OPF. The note on the AF Form 971 is deleted, and the copies of the
          memorandums destroyed two years after the date of the memorandum.
       8.3.4.2. If the decision is a suspension, the supervisor gives the original copy of the

       971; and gives a copy of the memorandum to the NAF-HR for filing in the employee's
       OPF. This note is deleted, and the copies of the memorandums destroyed two years after
       the date the suspension ends. The supervisor records on the employee's time and

disciplinary and adverse action policy address appropriate actions for employees who misuse
their government purchase and travel charge card. It continues to be DoD policy that improper,
fraudulent, abusive, or negligent use of a government charge card is prohibited. This includes
any use of government charge cards at establishments or for purposes that are inconsistent with
the official business of DoD or with applicable regulations. DoD policy continues to require
supervisors, who receive information indicating that a civilian employee has engaged in any
misuse of a government charge card, to take appropriate action, including an investigation if
indicated. The supervisor of the responsible individual(s) will be informed in a timely manner so
that appropriate corrective or disciplinary/adverse action may be taken. In addition, civilian
personnel who fail to satisfy an indebtedness arising from the use of a government travel charge
card or those who fail to do so in a timely manner may be subject to corrective or
disciplinary/adverse action. Refer to Attachment 9 Figure A9.1 for appropriate penalties.

                               APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES

9.1. General Information on Appeals and Grievances:
   9.1.1. Employees dissatisfied with matters relating to conditions of employment are entitled
   to express that dissatisfaction by filing an appeal or grievance. The prompt and objective
   review of employee appeals and grievances is essential to a productive and mutually
   beneficial employee management relationship.
   9.1.2. Filing an appeal or grievance does not reflect unfavorably upon either the employee's
   standing in the organization or the employee's loyalty or value to the organization. An
   employee is free to use these procedures without fear of penalty or reprisal. No supervisor or
   other person acting in an official capacity for the AF may take, or threaten to take, any act of
   reprisal against an employee because that employee has exercised or expressed an intention
   to exercise any right under these procedures.
9.2. Publicity. At least once a year, the NAF-HR will:
   9.2.1. Bring the appeal and grievance procedures to the attention of employees.
   9.2.2. Notify employees where the appeal and grievance procedures are available for review.
9.3. Related Directives.
   9.3.1. EEO. AFI 36-2706, Equal Opportunity Program Military and Civilian, provides
   policies and procedures pertaining to investigation and settlement of complaints of
   discrimination.

   or her return from active military service.
   9.4.2. Day means calendar day.
   9.4.3. Grievance, except as provided in paragraph 9.6, means a request by an employee, or a
   group of employees acting collectively, for personal relief in a matter of concern or
   dissatisfaction relating to the employment of the employee(s) that is subject to the control of
   AF management.
   9.4.4. Personal relief means a specific remedy directly benefiting the employee and may not
   include a request for disciplinary or other action affecting another employee.
9.5. Matters Covered by These Procedures.
   9.5.1. Except as provided in paragraph 9.6, the grievance procedure in this chapter is used to
   review a grievance as defined in paragraph 9.4.3.

   9.5.2. An employee may appeal a BBA, as defined in paragraph 9.4.1, or a demotion based
   on position classification, as defined in paragraph 17.14, but only to the extent that the appeal
   alleges a failure by management to follow regulations or procedures which govern these
   actions. Management decisions that form the basis for BBAs, e.g., decisions regarding
   budget, workload, organization, or mission, are not appealable.
9.6. Matters Excluded from Coverage by the Grievance Procedure. The grievance
procedures do not apply to:
   9.6.1. Any matter that is subject to final administrative review or decision outside the AF or
   for which other authorized complaint or appeal systems are prescribed.
   9.6.2. The content of published AF publications applicable to NAF employees. However,
   the application or impact of such AF publications on the employee may be grievable if not
   otherwise excluded by this paragraph.
   9.6.3. Any allegation of discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
   age, or handicap subject to final administrative review by the Equal Employment
   Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under law or regulations of the EEOC. Such matters are
   referred to the chief EEO counselor.
   9.6.4. A Notice of Proposed Action.
   9.6.5. Separation during an employee's probationary period.

   BBA. Refer to paragraph 9.5.2.
   9.6.12. Any issue previously decided as a result of a prior grievance, appeal, or any other
   formal complaint system.
   9.6.13. Any matter relating to wage or salary rates or schedules.
9.7. Allegations of Discrimination. If an employee alleges discrimination based upon race,
color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap in connection with an appeal or grievance,
the official then considering the appeal or grievance terminates the proceedings, refers the
allegation of discrimination to the chief EEO Counselor, and notifies the employee of the referral
in writing.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  103


9.8. Representation.
   9.8.1. An employee may be accompanied, represented, and advised by a representative of
   the employee's choice at any stage of the procedure. The employee designates the
   representative in writing. A written designation is changed only by the employee's written
   notification to the official then considering the appeal or grievance.
   9.8.2. An employee may present an appeal or grievance without representation. However, if
   a bargaining unit employee chooses self-representation, the labor organization still retains the
   right to attend meetings and hearings convened to process the appeal or grievance.
   9.8.3. A member of the NAF-HR staff may not serve as a representative.
   9.8.4. In the U.S., a judge advocate may not represent an employee. Overseas, a judge
   advocate may serve as a representative, but only if he or she is personally requested by an
   employee and his or her supervisor determines that he or she is reasonably available.
   9.8.5. The FSS Commander/Director may disallow the employee's choice of representative if
   activities of the individual as representative would cause a conflict of interest or position;
   release of an employee from his or her official position to serve as representative would give
   rise to unreasonable costs to the government; or, priority work assignments of the individual
   preclude his or her release to serve as representative.
   9.8.6. The employee bears all costs of representation.
9.9. Official Time.
   9.9.1. An employee is entitled to a reasonable amount of official time, if the employee
   requests time and is otherwise in a duty status, to prepare and present an appeal or grievance
   under the procedures prescribed by this chapter. What is reasonable depends on the facts and
   circumstances of each case.
   9.9.2. If the employee's representative is an AF employee in a duty status, the representative
   is also entitled, upon request, to a reasonable amount of official time to assist or act for the
   employee in the preparation and presentation of an appeal or grievance.
   9.9.3. An employee serving as a union representative at a hearing or other formal discussion
   related to the appeal or grievance is normally entitled to official time. However, if the
   employee's representative is a bargaining unit member on official time, the union
   representative is charged with annual leave or LWOP.
   9.9.4. Employees and their representatives make advance arrangements with their
   supervisors for the use of official time. If there is a disagreement, the supervisor refers the
   matter to the NAF-HR for resolution.
9.10. Cancellation of an Appeal or Grievance.
   9.10.1. An appeal or grievance is cancelled by the official then considering it for the
   following reasons:
       9.10.1.1. Upon receipt of the employee's written request to cancel.
       9.10.1.2. Upon notification that the requested relief has been granted to the extent
       authorized, whether or not the employee requests cancellation.
104                                                       AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


       9.10.1.3. If the employee, or the employee's representative, does not furnish required
       information to proceed with the advancement of the case after having been warned, in
       writing, of the possibility of cancellation.
       9.10.1.4. Upon the death of the employee, or upon the employee's separation from
       AF employment for reasons not connected with the appeal or grievance, provided there is
       no question of pay involved or other personal relief that could be granted to the
       employee.
       9.10.1.5. Upon notification that the same matter or a directly related matter has been
       accepted for adjudication by some other agency or under some other complaint system
       authorized to review it.
   9.10.2. The official cancelling the appeal or grievance notifies the employee promptly, in
   writing, of the cancellation and the reasons for it.
9.11. Remedial Action.
   9.11.1. An employee is made whole when an appeal or grievance is resolved in favor of an
   employee. The employee is entitled to restoration to duty and to all pay and benefits he or
   she would have received had the action not taken place.
   9.11.2. An employee who successfully appeals a BBA is also entitled to a make whole
   remedy. However, if it is clear that the same action would have been taken against the
   employee even if the regulatory or procedural error had not been made, then there is no
   "make whole" entitlement.
   9.11.3. Special provisions for restoration of pay and benefits are in paragraph 17.13.15.
9.12. Appeal or Grievance File.
   9.12.1. The NAF-HR establishes a file containing all documents pertinent to the case when
   an appeal or grievance is accepted under these procedures. That file, as augmented during
   the processing of the appeal or grievance, becomes the official record of the appeal or
   grievance.
   9.12.2. The party initiating correspondence relating to the case is responsible for providing
   copies to the other party and to the NAF-HR for the official file.
   9.12.3. The file contains original documents whenever possible. It must not contain
   documents not available to the employee and his or her representative.
9.13. Appeal Procedures. If the incident giving rise to the appeal is for one of the reasons

       extent that he or she is unable to render an informed decision, he or she sends the appeal
       back to the installation commander with a request to gather specific additional facts. The
       MAJCOM/A1 sends the Step three decision directly to the employee. He or she also

person (military member or civilian employee) whose conduct gave rise to the potential for
liability.
   9.15.1. If the potential for liability results from the conduct of both a person (military
   member or civilian employee) paid with APFs and a person paid with NAFs, the payments
   required by the settlement are apportioned between APFs and NAFs in amounts
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                           111


  approximating the degree of such persons' contributions to the potential liability. When
  determining the apportionment of APFs and NAFs, do not consider allegations that are
  obviously frivolous or that do not motivate settlement.
  9.15.2. These principles also apply to the funding of a judgment rendered by a third-party
  neutral such as an arbitrator, a Federal agency decision-maker, or a Federal court judge.

  an employee may hold a state, territorial, and local office if it does not conflict with duties,
  laws, or executive orders. No inquiries shall be made concerning the political affiliation of
  an employee or applicant for employment, and any disclosures of political affiliation shall
  not be considered in the employment process of the employee or applicant for employment.

     clerks; driving voters to a polling place; and running for non-partisan office (that is, an
     office to which political parties may not designate candidates). Employees who run for
     non-partisan office may not seek the endorsement of a political party or print partisan
     campaign literature.
     10.4.6.3. They may participate in the following political fundraising activities: making a
     financial political contribution; attending, addressing, or being featured guests at a
     political fundraiser (but refraining from soliciting contributions personally); soliciting or

10.5. Entitlement to Government Quarters and Facilities on AF Installations. In isolated
situations or areas where the only suitable quarters and facilities available are on the installation,
the commander may authorize their use by key personnel if he or she decides that the mission
will be better accomplished. If NAF employees live on the installation, they are given the
privilege of using those facilities available to AF APF employees. As DoD civilian employees,
NAF employees are authorized to use FSS facilities, according to AFI 34262, Services Programs
and Use Eligibility. While traveling on official business, a NAF employee is authorized to
occupy government quarters on a temporary basis and is authorized limited Base Exchange,
motion picture service, and emergency medical facility privileges.
10.6. Death of a NAF Employee.
   10.6.1. The installation commander is responsible for the official notification of the next of
   kin of an AF civilian employee assigned to that installation when the employee dies while on
   the job or while traveling on official business. This responsibility is carried out with the
   cooperation of the NAF-HR, the employee's supervisor, and other commanders. Prompt
   notification is essential so that the family will not learn about the loss from outside sources.
   When possible, notification is made by a representative of the AF in person, especially when
   the death occurs overseas under hostile circumstances. At the request of the installation
   commander, the NAF-HR and the supervisor assist in making the personal notification.
   10.6.2. Responsibilities.
       10.6.2.1. Supervisor.      The immediate (or next immediately available higher level)

           10.6.2.1.8. Notifies the president or secretary of the appropriate union so that, if the
           deceased was a member, the union may take the proper action to obtain any insurance
           or other benefits to which the survivors are entitled.
       10.6.2.2. NAF-HR. When the employee dies as a result of a work-related injury or
       illness, the NAF-HR notifies the local safety office, and HQ AFSVA/SVXHW, either by
       telephone or electronically describing the details surrounding the death, and processes
       workers' compensation forms.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                115

   notifies the American Embassy in the host nation.
   10.6.4. Memorandums of Condolence. The FSS commander or director sends an official
   memorandum of condolence to the next of kin within a week after the death occurs. This

   official government business away from the official duty station or while permanently
   serving outside the 50 States and the District of Columbia, the remains are prepared and
   transported according to AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Programs, and the Joint Travel
   Regulation (JTR), Volume 2, 1 May 94.
   10.6.7. Travel and Transportation of Family Members and Personal Property. When
   an employee stationed outside the continental U.S. (CONUS) dies, travel and transportation

      requires any statements regarding EEO and/or job vacancy announcements to include ―sexual
      orientation‖ to the list of characteristics, which will not factor in hiring decisions.
   10.7.2. AFI 36-2706, Equal Opportunity Program Military and Civilian, provides policies
   and procedures pertaining to investigation and settlement of complaints of discrimination.
10.8. FLSA Violations. An employee who believes the FLSA was violated may file a
complaint. Attachment 19 contains detailed complaint procedures. Employees with complaints
should make every effort to resolve complaints through supervisory channels before filing an
FLSA complaint.
10.9. Personnel Actions Based on Medical Qualifications.
   10.9.1. If an employee's conduct or performance is suspected to be adversely affected by the
   abuse of alcohol or drugs, the procedures contained in AFI 36-810, Substance Abuse
   Prevention and Control, are utilized. No personnel action is taken against an employee prior
   to completing the requirements of AFI 36-810.
   10.9.2. Management is not precluded from advising an employee to seek medical attention
   or counseling. When an employee raises his or her health status as an issue, the employee
   bears the burden to demonstrate the nature and impact of the condition. If the employee fails
   to provide adequate evidence to conclude that a medical condition exists, the supervisor may
   proceed with the management decision or personnel action.
   10.9.3. If an employee has a conduct or a performance problem, it is the employee’s
   responsibility to raise a medical condition which may be connected with the misconduct or
   deficient performance. The employee is responsible for bringing the medical condition to the
   attention of management and providing supporting documentation. After review of the
   medical information supplied by the employee, the supervisor may order a medical
   examination, or at the supervisor's option, offer a medical examination.
         10.9.3.1. When the employee is in a job that requires physical or medical standards, and
         the medical information provided by the employee indicates a question about the
         employee's ability to meet the job's physical or medical requirements, the supervisor may
         require the employee to report for a medical examination.
         10.9.3.2. When the employee is not in a position that requires physical or medical
         standards, and the medical information provided by the employee provides no basis to act
         on the employee's request for consideration of a medical condition, the supervisor may
         offer a medical examination to verify current medical status.
         10.9.3.3. When the supervisor requires or offers a medical examination, the employee is
         told in writing of the reasons for the requirement or offer, and the consequences of non-
         cooperation.
   10.9.4. Management is not obligated to determine if a medical condition is the cause of a
   conduct or performance deficiency before proposing an action. However, if the employee
   provides validated medical documentation, which is accepted as the cause of the deficiency

       qualified to perform.
       10.9.4.3. Separate the employee under procedures described in Chapter 8. If the
       supervisor believes that there is a medical problem contributing to an employee's
       performance or conduct problem and the employee does not acknowledge it, provide
       medical documentation or refuses to take an ordered medical examination, the supervisor
       should proceed as if there were no suspected medical problems.
10.10. Evaluation of Pregnant Civilian Employees. NAF-HRs shall observe procedures
contained in AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management, 1 May 06, Chapter 4.

                       EMPLOYEE EDUCATION AND TRAINING

11.1. Education and Training and Career Development. AF leadership recognizes education
and training are wise investments that enhance both job efficiency and individual career
development. Training is usually more specific in nature and provides trainees with specific
skills to perform a current task or job. Education on the other hand, often includes a broad-
spectrum of knowledge that will facilitate growth and development both now and well into the
future. Each fiscal year, numerous related classes, workshops, and conferences are scheduled at
various locations. Interested personnel should contact their supervisor and Unit Training
Manager (UTM) regarding eligibility and funding for these opportunities. The AF also provides,
when practical, career and executive development programs within NAFIs, to attract and retain a
well-qualified work force.
   11.1.1. US AF Programs and Facilities. AF programs and facilities are used to the
   maximum extent possible for training and developing NAF employees.
   11.1.2. Training Responsibilities.
       11.1.2.1. Please refer to AFI 34-254, Services Education and Training, Chapter 2, to
       review specific duties and responsibilities of key members in the training process.
       11.1.2.2. First line supervisors are responsible for job induction and, with the help of the
       UTM, as required; they identify, document, and evaluate training; provide required on-
       the-job training (OJT); inform employees of self-development opportunities, and
       encourage their participation in these activities.
       11.1.2.3. The NAF-HR conducts new employee orientation and the NAF Human
       Resources Management Course; identifies and schedules NAF supervisors for the NAF
       Human Resources Management Course; coordinates all training over eighty hours; and
       otherwise helps first-line supervisors in fulfilling their training needs. The UTM
       coordinates with the FSMC training office all course completion information for APF
       employees who complete the NAF Human Resources Management Course.
       11.1.2.4. Employees should keep informed of changes that occur in their career fields,
       take part in self-development activities, keep their supervisor and the training manager
       informed of self-development accomplishments, and share newly acquired skills with
       their fellow employees.
11.2. Funding for Education and Training.
   11.2.1. Each NAF Council and applicable commander or director approves the authorization
   to expend NAFs for tuition, per diem, and travel for the education and training of NAF
   personnel. Such proposed expenditures are included in NAF operating budgets. When travel
   funds are involved, expenses for the essential travel of NAF employees may be authorized
   not to exceed those amounts authorized in the JTR, Volume 2, for employees paid from
   APFs. Operational managers, with the help of the training manager approve self-study
   courses, employee orientation, and supervisory instruction in basic policies for administering
   NAF employees.
120                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      11.2.2. AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFS), addresses the use of NAFs for
      education, training, per diem, and travel allowances for NAF employees.
   11.2.3. Regular employees may be reimbursed for costs incurred for education courses at
   nongovernment facilities when funds are available. Tuition Assistance reimbursement for
   nongovernment training is not authorized for the sole purpose of getting a degree, but rather
   for the purpose of developing those skills, abilities, and knowledge that best qualify the
   employee for the performance of official duties.
11.3. Scope and Definitions. Training for flexible employees (including off-duty military
members) is limited to orientation sessions, job inductions, self-study courses, OJT and skill-
level training directed or conducted by HQ USAF, MAJCOM, or base (not to exceed 80 hours
duration). Regular employees are also eligible for this training. Regular employees (other than
ODM members) are eligible for the required training offered through off-base facilities, by AF,
interagency, and nongovernment sources, if they meet established prerequisites and if funds have
been approved.
   11.3.1. Self-development is education, training, and other development activities that the
   employee participates in to be better qualified for work or a profession, and that contribute to
   general growth and enlightenment.
   11.3.2. OJT is planned and designed by the supervisor to ensure that the employee is
   proficient in all elements of his or her present position, and econtributes to the employee's
   development.
   11.3.3. Training and career development, provided by NAFIs, supplement both self-
   development and OJT. They are provided through AF, other government, or nongovernment
   courses. When possible, training and career development are met through locally conducted
   programs. Off-base facilities are used only when they can be justified on the basis of
   economy, feasibility, and needs.
   11.3.4. Other training activities include, but are not necessarily limited to:
         11.3.4.1. Employee Orientation. Employee orientation is a planned and systematic
         program to familiarize new employees with the employing NAFI mission and
         organization, and with specific duties of their individual jobs. The orientation includes
         the desk orientation conducted by the NAF-HR during the in-processing of a new
         employee; and new employee orientation training and job induction, conducted by the
         first-level supervisor within the employee's first week of assignment.
         11.3.4.2. NAF Human Resources Supervisor’s Course. This course, taught at the
         local level, provides the necessary instruction in those basic aspects of supervising NAF
         employees under the AF NAF personnel system. It is mandatory that any person who
         supervises a NAF employee attend this course. Supervisors of three or more NAF
         employees are required to attend the course no later than 6 months after assignment. The
         course is conducted by the NAF-HR. As a minimum, the following core topic areas will
         be covered:
         Affirmative Employment

         Employee Management Relations
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 121



       Labor Management Relations

       Classification and Pay

       Employee Training and Development
11.4. Training and Development Procedures. Supervisors determine, document, and report
training and development needs. Each supervisor analyzes the skill and knowledge required for
each job, and compares them with the capabilities of each person under his or her direct
supervision. The supervisor discusses performance requirements with each employee to
determine individual training needs.
   11.4.1. When NAFs are used for tuition, travel, and per diem costs for training that will
   exceed 80 hours, the employee to receive the training must agree to continue in the service of
   the employing AF NAFI for a prescribed period of time or to reimburse the NAFI that funded
   the costs of the training. For this purpose, the NAF-HR completes, and the employee signs,
   the AF Form 2547, NAF Service and Reimbursable Agreement. The original is filed in the
   employee's OPF and the duplicate is given to the employee. When an employee continues to
   receive a salary and full benefits during the training period, the employee must agree to
   continue in the service of an NAFI for a period four times the period of the training, up to a
   maximum of 24 months of obligated service (refer to table 11.1). However, when the
   employee receives no salary or benefits during the training, but does receive payment of
   additional expenses (such as tuition, books, travel, per diem, etc.), the employee must agree
   to continue in the service of a NAFI for a period two times the period of the training, up to a
   maximum of 24 months of obligated service.
   11.4.2. The period of obligated service begins the first workday after the education and
   training ends. Periods in a paid leave status; in a nonpay status, when the employee is
   receiving Workers' Compensation benefits; in a military leave status; and in a forced leave or
   furlough status count towards an employee's obligated service. The period of obligated
   service ends when the required number of hours of obligated service are worked or at the end
   of twenty-four calendar months, whichever is earlier.
   11.4.3. The employee who fails to fulfill his or her obligated service commitment pays back
   the prorated share to the NAFI that funds the costs of the training. The amount due is
   proportionate to the percentage that the remaining service obligation bears to the original
   total service obligation. Payback expenses include such items as travel, per diem, tuition,
   books, classroom and laboratory fees, and other fees. They do not include regular pay or
   benefits. When the employee does not make reimbursement for amounts due before
   separation, proper deductions are made from any pay or other financial entitlements due the
   employee.
11.5. AF Form 852, NAF Record of Training or Certification of Equivalency. This form is a
permanent record of training received (or equivalency credit granted), which is significant to the
employee's future assignment. The training manager:
   11.5.1. Completes AF Form 852, (unless a comparable training record has been issued by
   another government agency), in duplicate, within thirty days after the completion of the
122                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      training or after the grant of an equivalency credit. When the equivalency credit is granted,
      the training manager records the basis for granting credit in the remarks section.
   11.5.2. Sends one copy to the employee's supervisor, who posts the information to the
   employee's AF Form 971. The supervisor gives the AF Form 852 to the employee for his or
   her personal use.
   11.5.3. Provides one copy of AF Form 852 to the NAF-HR for filing in the employee's OPF.
   Does not file in the OPF any AF Forms 852 or comparable records of training for short
   training periods that would not materially enhance the employee's qualification or have any
   bearing on employment elsewhere, such as training in correspondence practices, files
   maintenance and disposition, or orientation training.

                                         Chapter 13

                DOD EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PORTABILITY PROGRAM

13.1. Purpose. This chapter implements Public Law 101-508, Portability of Benefits for
Nonappropriated Fund Employees Act of 1990.
13.2. Applicability. Because of the unique requirements of the DoD Employee Benefit
Portability Program, this chapter is applicable to both NAF and APF civilian employees. It
contains personnel requirements for both systems.
13.3. Coverage and Effective Date. The DoD Employee Benefit Portability Program applies to
DoD civilian employees who move between NAF and APF employment systems within DoD
without a break in service of more than three calendar days. The program applies regardless of
whether the move is involuntary (employee is moved with position from one system to the other)
or voluntary (employee initiates the move by applying for and receiving employment in the other
system). However, many provisions are applied differently depending on whether the move is
involuntary or voluntary. The program is effective retroactively to 1 Jan 87. DoD employees
(individuals currently in an employee status) who have moved on or after that date will have
their benefits adjusted as though the program were in existence on the date of their move.
Employees who retire from one employment system to accept employment in the other system
(voluntary or involuntary moves) will receive only service credit for RIF and annual leave
accrual under the Portability Act.
13.4. Appointments.
   13.4.1. Involuntary Move:
       13.4.1.1. A NAF employee may be eligible for noncompetitive conversion to career or
       career conditional employment if the employee was serving in a NAF position on the date
       that the position was brought into the competitive service and the Agency determines that
       this is a "continuing" position. Criteria in 5 CFR §315.201, Career- and Career-
       Conditional Employment, must be met.
       13.4.1.2. An APF employee whose position is abolished and reestablished as a NAF
       position will be afforded RIF rights according to 5 CFR, §351. Employees who are
       converted to NAF status will be appointed noncompetitively.
   13.4.2. Voluntary Move. Regardless of the direction of the move, the normal appointment
   procedures of the gaining employment system apply.
13.5. Pay Provisions for Moves from NAF to APF Positions.
   13.5.1. General Applicability:
       13.5.1.1. Rate of Basic Pay. The Portability Act amended 5 U.S.C., to include pay
       setting provisions of NAF employees moving to APF positions. The pay provisions of
       OPM Operating Manual Federal Wage System–Appropriated Fund continue to apply to
       APF wage schedule positions. The paragraphs below describe how to set pay for
       employees, based upon the pay plan of the position the employee left and the pay plan of
       the position to which the employee moves. For the purpose of this section, the term
126                                                   AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      ―NAFI highest previous rate‖ means the highest rate of basic pay received by the
      employee during service in a NAFI position, as described in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c).
      13.5.1.2. Grade and Pay Retention. The Portability Act authorized grade and pay
      retention for all NAF employees who are involuntarily moved to an APF position. The
      application of grade and pay retention is described under paragraphs 13.5.2.1.2,
      13.5.3.1.3, and 13.5.4.1.2.
   13.5.2. Setting Basic Pay upon Movement from any NAF Position to a GS/NSPS
   Position:
      13.5.2.1. Involuntary Move:
      13.5.2.1.1. When an employee is moved involuntarily from a NAFI position in DoD or
      the Coast Guard to a GS position, without a break in service of more than three days,
      from a position with substantially the same duties in a DoD or Coast Guard NAFI to a GS
      position in the same agency, the employee is entitled to an initial payable rate of basic
      pay (including any locality pay or special rate supplement) at the lowest step of the grade
      that is equal to or greater than the employee’s rate of basic pay in the NAFI position
      immediately before the move. Compare the employee's former NAFI rate to the highest
      applicable rate range for the employee's GS position of record and official worksite in
      effect immediately prior to the move. For purposes of this paragraph, ―moved
      involuntarily‖ means the movement of the incumbent of an NAFI position in the DoD or
      the Coast Guard with the position when it is moved to the civil service employment
      system of the DoD or the Coast Guard, respectively.
         13.5.2.1.2. For an employee covered by paragraph 13.5.2.1.1, pay may be set at the
         initial payable rate of basic pay at any of the following rates, unless the employee is
         entitled to receive a higher rate of basic pay under paragraph 13.5.2.1.1:
             13.5.2.1.2.1. A step rate within the highest applicable rate range for the
             employee’s GS/NSPS position of record and official worksite that does not
             exceed the employee’s NAFI highest previous rate (consistent with method
             prescribed in paragraph 13.5.2.2 and 13.5.2.2.1.;
                 13.5.2.1.2.1.1. A rate determined under the maximum payable rate rule in
                 §531.221 of 5 CFR (using non-NAFI rates of basic pay); or
                 13.5.2.1.2.1.2. A rate determined under the authority to grant pay retention in
                 5 CFR 536.302(a).
         13.5.2.1.3. Grade and pay retention benefits apply where the involuntary move
         resulted in a reduction in grade or pay.
         13.5.2.1.4. A reduction in grade occurs when the representative rate of the position to
         which the employee is converted is lower than the representative rate of the position
         from which the employee moved. For pay banded employees, the employee's current
         existing rate of basic pay is the representative rate.
         13.5.2.1.5. Prior to moving an employee from NAF Pay band V to a GS/NSPS
         position, the NAF activity determines if an adjustment in NAF pay is necessary.
         Adjustments in NAF pay are effected, where necessary, to ensure that the maximum
         rate of pay retained in the move will not exceed the rate of pay for a GS-15, Step 10
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                127


        for the position and geographical area to which moved. For moves into an NSPS
        position, pay setting criteria is in accordance with 5 CFR 9901.353.
     13.5.2.2. Voluntary Move. When a DOD or the Coast Guard employee moves
     voluntarily, without a break in service of more than 3 days from an NAFI position in the
     DoD or the Coast Guard to a GS position in the same agency, pay may be set at the
     employee's initial payable rate of basic pay at any step rate in the highest applicable rate
     range currently in effect for the employee’s GS position of record and official worksite
     which does not exceed the employee’s NAFI highest previous rate of pay, except as
     provided in paragraph 13.5.2.2.1 or 13.5.2.2.1.3.
        13.5.2.2.1. If the highest applicable rate range would be different if the official
        worksite for the employee’s position of record were located at the place where the
        employee was stationed while earning the NAFI highest previous rate, determine the
        employee’s maximum payable rate of basic pay as follows:
            13.5.2.2.1.1. Compare the NAFI highest previous rate to the highest applicable
            rate range currently in effect in the location where the employee was stationed
            while earning that rate. The highest applicable rate range is determined based on
            the pay schedules that would be applicable to the employee’s current GS position
            of record if the employee were stationed in that location. Identify the highest step
            rate in the highest applicable rate range that was equal to or lower than the NAFI
            highest previous rate. If the NAFI highest previous rate is less than the range
            minimum, identify the minimum step rate (step 1).
            13.5.2.2.1.2. Identify the step rate in the highest applicable rate range for the
            employee’s current official worksite and position of record that corresponds to the
            step rate derived under paragraph 13.5.2.2.1.1. That corresponding rate is the
            maximum payable rate at which the employee’s pay may be set under this section,
            except as provided by paragraph 13.5.2.2.1.3. Pay may be set at the employee’s
            rate of basic pay at any step rate below that maximum payable rate.
            13.5.2.2.1.3. An agency may choose to apply the maximum payable rate rule in
            §531.221 of 5 CFR based on a non-NAFI rate of basic pay if that rule provides a
            higher rate than provided by paragraph 13.5.2.2 or 13.5.2.2.1.
     13.5.2.3. For employees moving into NSPS positions, pay setting criteria is in
     accordance with 5 CFR 9901.353.
  13.5.3. Setting Basic Pay upon Movement from an NA, NL, or NS NAF Crafts and
  Trades Position to a WG, WL, or WS APF Wage Schedule Position.
     13.5.3.1. Involuntary Move:
        13.5.3.1.1. Basic pay may be set at either:
            13.5.3.1.1.1. The employee's existing scheduled rate of pay; or,
            13.5.3.1.1.2. At any rate which does not exceed his or her highest previous rate of
            pay. If the highest previous rate falls between two rates of the new grade, the
            higher rate may be paid. The highest previous rate of pay is computed according
            to OPM, Operating Manual Federal Wage System-Appropriated Fund, S8-3e.
128                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


          13.5.3.1.2. In either of the above, the employee's pay cannot be less than the
          minimum rate of the grade of the position.
          13.5.3.1.3. Grade and pay retention benefits apply where the involuntary move
          resulted in a reduction in grade or pay. Grade and pay retention benefits will be
          administered according to OPM, Operating Manual Federal Wage System –
          Appropriated Fund, Subchapter S9.
          13.5.3.1.4. A reduction in grade occurs when the representative rate of the position to
          which the employee is converted is lower than the representative rate of the position
          from which the employee moved.
      13.5.3.2. Voluntary Move. Basic pay may be set at either:
          13.5.3.2.1. The minimum step rate of the grade of the position; or,
          13.5.3.2.2. At any rate of the new grade which does not exceed the employee's
          highest previous rate of pay. If the highest previous rate falls between two rates of
          his or her grade, the higher rate may be paid. The highest previous rate of pay is
          computed according to OPM, Operating Manual Federal Wage System–Appropriated
          Fund, S8-3e.
   13.5.4. Setting Basic Pay Upon Movement From a Universal Annual (UA),
   Administrative Support (AS), Patron Service (PS), or Pay band NAF Position to an
   APF Wage Schedule Position.
      13.5.4.1. Involuntary Move:
          13.5.4.1.1. Basic pay is set according to OPM, Operating Manual Federal Wage
          System–Appropriated Fund, Subchapter S8, provisions for new appointments. Under
          these provisions, pay is set at the minimum rate of the grade of the position, except as
          provided by exceptions for recognition of special qualifications and hard-to-fill
          occupations.
          13.5.4.1.2. Grade and pay retention benefits apply where the involuntary move
          resulted in a reduction in grade or pay. Grade and pay retention benefits are
          administered according to OPM, Operating Manual Federal Wage System–
          Appropriated Fund, Subchapter 9.
          13.5.4.1.3. A reduction in grade occurs when the representative rate of the position to
          which the employee is converted is lower than the representative rate of the position
          from which the employee moved. For pay banded employees, the employee's current
          existing rate of basic pay is the representative rate.
      13.5.4.2. Voluntary Move. Basic pay is set according to OPM, Operating Manual
      Federal Wage System-Appropriated Fund, Subchapter S8, provisions for new
      appointment. Under these provisions, pay is set at the minimum rate of the grade of the
      position, except as provided by exceptions for recognition of special qualifications and
      hard-to-fill occupations.
13.6. Pay Provisions for Moves from APF to NAF Positions.
   13.6.1. General Applicability:
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              129


     13.6.1.1. Rate of Basic Pay. The NAF UA, AS, PS, and pay band pay setting provisions
     have been adjusted to parallel the pay setting provisions provided by the Portability Act
     for movements to the GS/NSPS. NAF crafts and trades positions are covered by the pay
     provisions of OPM, Operating Manual Federal Wage System–Nonappropriated Fund.
     Paragraphs 13.6.2 and 13.6.3 describe how to set pay for employees, based upon the pay
     plan of the position the employee left and the pay plan of the position to which the
     employee moves.
     13.6.1.2. Grade and Pay Retention. There are no NAF provisions for grade retention
     for UA, AS, PS, or pay band employees. An APF employee involuntarily moved to a
     UA, AS, PS, or pay band position will be eligible for pay retention. An employee
     involuntarily moved from any APF position to a NAF crafts and trades position is
     covered by the grade and pay retention provisions of OPM, Operating Manual Federal
     Wage System–Nonappropriated Fund. Instructions for applying grade and/or pay
     retention are found in paragraphs 13.6.2.1 and 13.6.3.1.2.
  13.6.2. Setting Basic Pay Upon Movement from any APF Position to a UA, AS, PS, or
  Pay band NAF Position.
     13.6.2.1. Involuntary Move. Pay is set at a rate within the NAF grade or pay band level
     that is not less than the employee's rate of basic pay immediately prior to the move. In
     determining the employee's last rate of basic pay, a saved pay rate to which the employee
     was entitled under the APF system will apply, as well as pay received in an APF special
     rate position. Additions to pay such as night shift, environmental differential, and other
     premium payments are excluded from consideration as basic pay. Basic pay is not set
     above the maximum of the grade to which moved unless the employee's last rate of basic
     pay is above the maximum rate of the grade or pay band level to which moved. Then,
     pay retention provisions are applied according to DoDI 1400.25-V1405.
     13.6.2.2. Voluntary Move. Basic pay may be set at either:
        13.6.2.2.1. The minimum step rate of the grade of the position or pay band level; or,
        13.6.2.2.2. At any step of that grade or any rate within that pay band level which
        does not exceed the employee's highest previous rate of basic APF pay.
  13.6.3. Setting Basic Pay Upon Movement from any APF Position to an NA, NL, or NS
  NAF Crafts and Trades Position.
     13.6.3.1. Involuntary Move:
        13.6.3.1.1. Basic pay may be set at either:
            13.6.3.1.1.1. The employee's existing scheduled rate of pay; or,
            13.6.3.1.1.2. At any rate which does not exceed his or her highest previous rate of
            pay. If the employee's highest previous rate falls between two rates of the new
            grade, the higher rate is paid. The highest previous rate of pay is computed
            according to OPM, Operating Manual Federal Wage System-Nonappropriated
            Fund, S8-3e.
        13.6.3.1.2. Grade and pay retention benefits apply where the involuntary move
        resulted in a reduction in grade or pay. Grade and pay retention benefits are
130                                                     AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


            administered according to OPM, Operating Manual Federal Wage System–
            Nonappropriated Fund, Subchapter 9.
            13.6.3.1.3. A reduction in grade occurs when the representative rate of the position to
            which the employee is converted is lower than the representative rate of the position
            from which the employee moved.
         13.6.3.2. Voluntary Move. Basic pay may be set at either:
            13.6.3.2.1. The minimum step rate of the grade; or,
            13.6.3.2.2. At any rate of the new grade which does not exceed employee's highest
            previous rate of pay. If employee's highest previous rate falls between two rates of
            his or her grade, the higher rate is paid. The highest previous rate of pay for an
            employee is computed according to OPM, Operating Manual Federal Wage System–
            Nonappropriated Fund , Subchapter 8-3e.
13.7. Crediting of Service in Waiting Periods for Within-Grade Increases (WGI).
   13.7.1. NAF to APF GS Moves. NAF service is credited toward the period of service
   required for WGIs in the GS. The service of a former NAF employee, who moves under the
   provisions of the Portability Act, is creditable in the computation of the waiting period for
   one WGI. When crediting the service of a former NAF employee, the waiting period for the
   next WGI begins at the time the employee is deemed to have received his or her last
   equivalent increase.
   13.7.2. NAF to APF Wage Schedule Moves:
         13.7.2.1. NAF NA, NL, and NS service is credited toward the period of service required
         for WGIs according to OPM, Operating Manual Federal Wage System–Appropriated
         Fund.
         13.7.2.2. NAF service in UA, AS, PS, or pay band positions is not creditable.
   13.7.3. APF to NAF Moves. APF service is credited in the same manner as NAF service.
         13.7.3.1. APF service will be credited toward the period of service required for WGIs in
         AS, PS, and NAF crafts and trades positions according to DoDI 1400.25, V1405.
         13.7.3.2. As there are no WGIs in the NAF pay band system, there is no creditable
         service.
13.8. Crediting of Service Towards Time-In-Grade Requirement for Promotion.
      13.8.1. NAF to APF Moves. NAF service is credited in the GS according to 5 CFR Part
      300, Subpart F, Time-in-Grade Restrictions.
   13.8.2. APF to NAF Moves. There is no time-in-grade requirement for promotion in the
   NAF personnel system.
13.9. Crediting of Time-In-Service in Computing Severance Pay (Involuntary and
Voluntary Moves):
   13.9.1. NAF to APF Move. NAF service is creditable service for purposes of determining
   an APF employee's entitlement to severance pay. Criteria for meeting the requirement for
   twelve months of continuous employment for eligibility for severance pay under the
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 131


   GS/NSPS credits an appointment to a position in a NAFI of the DoD or the Coast Guard that
   precedes the current qualifying appointment in the DoD or the Coast Guard, respectively.
   Creditable service is defined as service by an employee of a NAFI of the DoD or the Coast
   Guard, who moves, within the civil service employment system of the DoD or the Coast
   Guard, respectively, without a break in service of more than three calendar days, to a position
   classified and paid under the GS/NSPS.
   13.9.2. APF to NAF Move. Employees who move from civil service to NAF positions shall
   receive credit for APF employment for purposes of severance pay.
13.10. Retirement. All retirement portability provisions are applied exactly the same regardless
of whether the move is involuntary or voluntary. Also, except for the areas of employer and
employee contributions addressed below, all provisions are applied exactly the same regardless
of the direction of the move, NAF to APF or APF to NAF.
   13.10.1. Employee Election of Retirement Plan. An employee need not be vested in the
   plan of the losing employment system at the time of a move in order to elect to remain in that
   retirement system when moving between civil service and NAF positions. The employee
   may elect to enter the plan of the gaining employment system without transfer of credited
   service from the losing plan. Once an employee is given an opportunity to retain
   membership in either FERS or CSRS, he or she is never again given an opportunity to retain
   membership in that same plan. Once an employee is given an opportunity to retain coverage
   in a NAF plan, he or she is never again given an opportunity to retain membership in any
   NAF plan.
       13.10.1.1. Election to Retain Coverage in Plan of Losing Employment System. If an
       employee elects to retain active membership in the plan of the losing employment
       system, the election is irrevocable. Therefore, regardless of future moves between NAF
       and APF employment, in or out of DoD, breaks in service, and retirement status, the
       employee's retirement coverage remains with the plan in which the employee elects to
       retain membership. Those employees who qualify for retroactive adjustment of NAF
       plan coverage will be given a reasonable opportunity to repay any previously withdrawn
       contributions and/or contributions for credited service for which deductions have not
       been made. Repayment procedures contained in AFI 34-302, Air Force Nonappropriated
       Fund Employee Retirement Plan, that apply to reinstatement of prior participation credit
       also apply in situations described in this paragraph.
       13.10.1.2. Election to Enter Plan of Gaining Employment System. If an employee
       elects to enter the plan of the gaining employment system, the election is irrevocable.
       Moreover, the employee's credited service under the losing plan does not transfer to the
       gaining plan. Therefore, the SCD used by the gaining employment system for the
       purpose of determining credited service is the date the employee enters the plan of the
       gaining employment system (unless the employee already has service credited in that
       plan). For example, if a NAF employee moves to APF status and enters FERS, the
       employee will receive no service credit in FERS for time spent in the NAF plan. Time
       spent in the NAF plan will not count for FERS annuity computation or retirement
       eligibility. The employee may not purchase such service credit by paying money into the
       FERS plan to cover the NAF service.
132                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


   13.10.2. Standard Election Form. Two standard election forms have been issued--one
   covering CSRS, CSRS Offset or FERS to NAF, and one covering NAF to either CSRS or
   FERS. The Notice of NAF Election, Retirement Coverage Election Under Section 1131 of
   Public Law 107-107 will be placed in the OPF when an employee elects to retain
   membership in a NAF retirement plan. Use of election forms RI 38-134, RI 38-144, are
   covered in CSRS and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices. AF personnel
   offices will use the appropriate election form and explain its purpose to the employee. The
   gaining employment system personnel office must fill in Part 1 of the appropriate election
   form. This requires assistance and cooperation from the losing employment system, which
   must provide timely information.
   13.10.3. Time Limit for Making Election. If the move occurs on or after 7 Apr 91, the
   time limit for making the election is 30 days after the effective date of the move. If the move
   occurred on or after 1 Jan 87, but before 7 Apr 91, the time limit for making the election was
   6 May 91. If the employee fails to return the standard election form to the personnel office
   by the appropriate deadline, the employee, in effect, elects to enter the plan of the gaining
   employment system without transfer of losing plan service credit.
   13.10.4. Waiver of Time Limit for Making Election. An employee is granted a waiver of
   the deadline for making an election if he or she can show that (1) he or she exercised due
   diligence to make the election prior to the deadline, and (2) due to circumstances beyond his
   or her control he or she was unable to do so. An employee will be deemed to have exercised
   "due diligence" if he or she can show that he or she made a good faith effort to notify the
   agency of his or her election prior to the deadline. "Circumstances beyond his or her control"
   includes, by way of example, the following: (1) on the date of the deadline the employee
   was in an extended leave or temporary duty status away from his or her home or duty station;
   or (2) on the date of the deadline the employee was unable, due to physical or mental
   incapacitation, to exercise his or her option. An employee's failure to make a timely election
   due to his or her error in judgment or failure to read information provided by the Agency is
   not "circumstances beyond his or her control." If an employee fails to make an election
   within the applicable time limit, he or she may file a request for waiver of the time limit.
   Under normal circumstances, a request for waiver is submitted within ten calendar days of
   the expiration of the time limit. The request for waiver is in writing and includes an
   explanation of the employee's good faith effort to notify the agency of his or her election
   prior to the deadline and the circumstances beyond his or her control which prevented him or
   her from doing so. APF employees submit the request for waiver to the Civilian Personnel
   Office (FSMC), and NAF employees submit the request for waiver to the FSS commander or
   director. The decision to grant or deny the request is made in writing within ten calendar
   days from the date of receipt of the employee's request. If the request for waiver is denied,
   the employee may appeal the denial. The appeal is submitted, in writing, to the FSMC or
   FSS commander or director, as applicable, within seven calendar days from the date the
   employee receives the denial. Within seven calendar days from the date of receipt of the
   appeal, management forwards the appeal to the MAJCOM/A1K or A1S, as applicable, where
   MAJCOM/A1K and MAJCOM/A1S jointly rule on the appeal. If the MAJCOM does not
   reverse the base-level decision, it has seven calendar days to forward the appeal to HQ
   USAF/A1K or A1S, as applicable, where HQ USAF/A1K and A1S will, within fourteen
   calendar days of receipt of the appeal, jointly render a final decision. In computing the time
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   133


   limits prescribed above, if the last day of the time limit falls on a nonduty day, the time limit
   is extended to the next duty day. The procedures for waiving the time limit must not allow
   reviews under any employee grievance procedures, including the negotiated and
   administrative grievance procedures.
   13.10.5. Effective Date of Election. The election is retroactive to the date of the move.
   13.10.6. Employee Contribution to Plan when an Employee Elects to Retain Coverage
   in the Plan of the Losing Employment System. If an employee elects to retain coverage in
   the plan of the losing employment system, the employee's contribution to the plan is
   determined in the same manner as it is determined for the other employees in the plan, and
   the gaining employer remits the employee's contribution to the plan, including FERS Thrift
   Savings Plan contributions, if applicable.
   13.10.7. Employer Contribution to Plan When an Employee Elects to Retain Coverage
   in the Plan of the Losing Employment System:
       13.10.7.1. NAF Employer Contribution to Defined Benefit Part of FERS. The
       employer contribution is the "normal cost percentage" of basic pay determined by OPM
       under Title 5 U.S.C. 8423. Also, social security payments are made for employees in
       FERS.
       13.10.7.2. NAF Employer Contribution to FERS Thrift Savings Plan. The employer
       contribution is a minimum of 1% of basic pay regardless of whether the employee
       contributes; and, additionally, if the employee does contribute, the employer matches the
       employee's contribution dollar for dollar for the first 3% of pay contributed and $.50 on
       the dollar for the next 2% of pay contributed. (Note: While a CSRS participant
       contributes up to 5 percent of basic pay to the FERS Thrift Savings Plan, no employer
       matching contribution is permitted.)
       13.10.7.3. NAF Employer Contribution to CSRS. The employer contribution for the
       NAF employee in the CSRS is calculated in exactly the same way as the agency
       contribution for an APF employee in CSRS. Also, social security payments are not made
       for employees in CSRS, but are made for employees in CSRS offset.
       13.10.7.4. APF Employer Contribution to a NAF Retirement Plan. The employer
       contribution for an APF employee in the NAF plan is calculated in exactly the same way
       as the contribution for a NAF employee in the NAF plan.
13.11. Annual, Sick, and Home Leave. All provisions are applied exactly the same regardless
of whether the move is involuntary or voluntary, and regardless of the direction of the move,
NAF to APF or APF to NAF.
   13.11.1. Transfer of Leave Balance. All leave hours transfer without limit. The employee
   is credited with the full amount of leave even in those cases where the employee receives a
   higher rate of pay from the gaining employment system. The employee may not cash in any
   portion of the leave balance and be paid for accumulated hours. Leave is administered
   according to the rules of the gaining system.
   13.11.2. Transfer of Funds. There is no transfer of funds between APF and NAF.
   13.11.3. Annual Leave Accrual Rate. Service in the losing employment system is credited
   in determining the appropriate leave accrual rate.

13.12. Health and Life Insurance.
   13.12.1. NAF to APF (Involuntary and Voluntary Moves):
         13.12.1.1. Employee Coverage. Employees may not elect to remain in NAF health or
         life insurance plans. Employees may enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits
         (FEHB) Program and/or the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program
         according to the requirements of 5 CFR Part 890 and 5 CFR Part 870, respectively. The
         employee's NAF health benefits coverage is extended without charge to the employee for
         31 days or until the employee becomes covered by FEHB, whichever comes first.
         13.12.1.2. Retiree Coverage. Refer to 5 CFR Part 890 and 870. Participation in the
         FEHB after retirement does not depend on retirement from FERS or CSRS if the
         employee retires from a NAF plan because the portability law includes the NAF
         retirement plans as qualifying plans.
      13.12.2. APF to NAF Move:
         13.12.2.1. Employee Coverage:
            13.12.2.1.1. Involuntary Move. Employees may not elect to retain membership in
            the FEHB or FEGLI programs. Employees participating in the FEHB program and/or
            the FEGLI program at the time of the move would automatically qualify for
            participation (including family coverage) in the respective NAF health and/or life
            insurance program regardless of preexisting medical conditions and the NAF
            employment category to which the employee has been involuntarily moved. Normal
            NAF coverage rules would apply if there was not participation in the FEHB program
            and/or the FEGLI program at the time of the move.
            13.12.2.1.2. Voluntary Move. Employees may not elect to retain membership in the
            FEHB program and/or the FEGLI program. Normal NAF coverage rules apply.
            Employees are advised before actual employment whether or not they will be eligible
            for health and life insurance benefits.
         13.12.2.2. Retiree Coverage:
            13.12.2.2.1. Involuntary Move. If an employee qualifies for health and/or life
            insurance coverage under paragraph 13.12.2.1.1, the employee, upon retirement from
            either an APF or NAF plan, is eligible for NAF health and/or life insurance coverage,
            provided that the employee has been continuously enrolled in the NAF group
            insurance plan since the employee’s first opportunity to enroll, and, provided further,
            that the employee satisfies any other qualifying periods or age requirements imposed
            by the NAF plan. Continuous time enrolled in the FEHB Program and/or the FEGLI
            Program immediately before the move is credited toward satisfying any qualifying
            period required by a NAF plan.
            13.12.2.2.2. Voluntary Move. If an employee qualifies for health and/or life
            insurance coverage under paragraph 13.12.2.1.2, the employee, upon retirement from
            either an APF or NAF plan, is eligible for NAF health and/or life insurance coverage,
            provided that the employee has been continuously enrolled in the NAF group
            insurance plan since the employee’s first opportunity to enroll, and, provided further,
            that the employee satisfies any other qualifying periods or age requirements imposed
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                135


           by the NAF plan. Continuous time enrolled in the FEHB Program and/or the FEGLI
           Program immediately before the move is credited toward satisfying any qualifying
           period required by a NAF plan.
13.13. RIF.
   13.13.1. NAF to APF Move. NAF employment is credited in addition to APF employment
   in determining APF retention registers. See the Guide to Processing Personnel Actions for
   details. Regarding the use of performance ratings in determining retention rights, NAF
   employees who are converted to APF positions are entitled to RIF credit for their NAF
   performance ratings for the purpose of determining their retention rights. Prior to movement
   of a NAF employee to an APF position, an AF Form 3527, NAF Employee Performance
   Evaluation, is accomplished if a current AF Form 3527 is not on file. This rating is
   necessary to ensure a NAF employee is given proper credit in APF RIF action. The last three
   appraisals are used for this action; therefore, the newly accomplished AF Form 3527 and
   appraisals on file for the two previous years are used. If none are on file for the preceding
   two years, a presumptive rating of fully successful is used. The NAF rating of outstanding
   equates to twenty points, very good is sixteen points and satisfactory receives twelve credit
   points.
   13.13.2. APF to NAF Move. APF employment is credited in addition to NAF employment
   in determining retention where NAF employment is credited for these purposes under normal
   NAF rules.
13.14. Probation Status. In the following provisions, reference is made to the terms same
agency and same line of work. The same agency is considered to be the same military
department. Positions are considered to be in the same line of work when the duties performed
are similar in nature and character and require substantially the same or similar qualifications.
   13.14.1. NAF to APF Move. All AF NAF service immediately preceding the move, which
   is in the same line of work as the new position is credited in determining probation status.
   See 5 CFR Part 315 for details.
   13.14.2. APF to NAF Move. All AF APF service immediately preceding the move, which
   is in the same line of work as the new position is credited in determining probation status.
13.15. Tenure.
   13.15.1. NAF to APF Move. See 5 CFR Part 315 for details.
       13.15.1.1. Involuntary Move. All continuous regular NAF service immediately
       preceding the move is credited in determining career tenure.
       13.15.1.2. Voluntary Move. No credit for NAF service is granted.
   13.15.2. APF to NAF Move (Involuntary and Voluntary Moves).                  Credit for APF
   employment is not required.
136                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


                                          Chapter 14

                                ATTENDANCE AND LEAVE

14.1. General Leave Information. Leave is an employee benefit that contributes to the overall
effectiveness, productivity, and morale of the employee. All regular employees accrue annual
and sick leave. The first-level supervisor approves or disapproves leave. Supervisors should
consider employees’ desires and personal convenience as well as the work situation when
granting annual leave. They must not make arbitrary decisions to deny leave. However, the final
determination as to the scheduling and the amount of annual leave granted at any specific time is
made by the supervisor authorized to approve leave.
14.2. Annual Leave. Annual leave is paid time off from work for vacation or to transact
personal business, which cannot be taken care of during off-duty hours. A leave year begins on
the first day of the first FULL bi-weekly pay period in a calendar year. A leave year ends on the
day immediately before the first day of the first FULL biweekly pay period in the following
calendar year.
   14.2.1. Creditable Service. The amount of annual leave earned depends on the employee’s
   total length of creditable service. The leave SCD is usually the date of appointment or
   conversion to regular employment. Fractional parts of months are included in determining
   length of service. An employee with prior service, or prior active duty military service, has
   the SCD adjusted in accordance with Attachment 10, and as follows:
       14.2.1.1. Prior DoD NAFI Service. All prior DoD NAFI service, including service with
       the current employer, as a regular employee is creditable. Use AF Form 2549, Statement
       of Prior DoD NAF Civilian Service, to document prior DoD NAF employment, both
       regular and flexible employment.
       14.2.1.2. Active Uniformed Service. All active uniformed service, except for certain
       retired members of the uniformed services as outlined below, terminated by honorable
       discharge under honorable conditions, or by transfer to inactive reserves under honorable
       conditions is creditable for determining the annual leave accrual rate. A member of a
       uniformed service appointed to a Federal civilian position while on terminal leave
       pending retirement from the uniformed service is entitled to credit for his or her years of
       active military service for the purpose of determining his or her leave accrual rate, but
       only during that period of terminal leave. After the member retires from the uniformed
       service, his or her annual leave accrual rate must be recalculated to reflect his or her
       reduced years of creditable service. That is, after retirement from the uniformed service,
       he or she is no longer entitled to receive credit for prior active military service, except
       under certain limited conditions as provided in 5 U.S.C 6303(a)(A)-(C) or (e). For an
       employee who is a retired member of any of the uniformed services, credit is restricted to
       the actual active service in the Armed Forces during wartime or in any campaign or
       expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized (as defined by Vet info
       Guide and Vet Guide). If the retired member meets one or more of the following
       conditions, all of his or her active service is counted for leave accrual:
           14.2.1.2.1. The retirement was based on disability resulting from injury or disease
           received in the line of duty as a direct result of armed conflict.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  137


         14.2.1.2.2. The retirement was based on disability caused by an instrumentality of
         war and incurred in the line of duty during a period of war (as defined by Vet info
         Guide and Vet Guide).
         14.2.1.2.3. On 30 Nov 64, the retired member was employed in a civilian office to
         which the annual and sick leave law applied, and continues to be employed in an
         office of this kind without a break in service of more than 30 days. (NOTE: The
         above provisions were effective as of 16 Feb 83. The leave accrual rate had to be
         adjusted as of that date. Recomputation of leave for employment periods before 16
         Feb 83 is not authorized.)
     14.2.1.3. Credit for Military Training. Civilian employees of NAFIs called to active
     duty for short periods of time (NTE six weeks) with Reserve components of the U.S.
     Armed Forces continue to accrue annual leave hours during such periods. Nonduty time
     while in Reserve components is not creditable.
     14.2.1.4. Exemptions. Under no circumstances must an employee who is currently in a
     leave category as a result of more liberal provisions of the separate DoD components
     prior to 6 Sep 74, be penalized by being placed in a lower category for leave accrual or
     accumulation purposes.
     14.2.1.5. Portability of Benefits for NAF Employees Act of 1990. Periods of APF
     civilian federal service are creditable for leave under the provisions of the Portability Act.
     14.2.1.6. Other Creditable Service.           Employees receiving benefits under the
     Longshoreman's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act; employees on military
     furlough; and employees reinstated within 6 months, carried on the rolls of the employing
     NAFI in a LWOP status do not accrue annual leave, but the time spent in this status is
     creditable service. Service credit is granted during other periods of time on the rolls in a
     nonpay status that does not exceed six months in the aggregate in any calendar year; for
     example, LWOP, suspensions, furloughs, forced leave, etc.
  14.2.2. Eligibility Time Period. An employee must have served under a regular
  appointment for a continuous period for ninety calendar days before leave can be credited to
  the employee's account. Although leave does accrue during the 90-day period, leave cannot
  be used during the 90-day qualifying period. Only one 90-day qualifying period is required
  during a period of continuous service.
  14.2.3. Annual Leave Accrual.
     14.2.3.1. Accrual. Annual leave is accrued by regular employees on the total number of
     hours in a pay status that does not exceed 40 hours in the administrative workweek.
     Annual leave accrual is based on the appropriate percentage (accrual rate) times a
     maximum of 40 hours per week, or eighty hours per biweekly pay period in accordance
     with the following:
     0-3 years service      5 percent of hours in a pay status
     3-15 years service     7½ percent of hours in a pay status
     15+ years service      10 percent of hours in a pay status
138                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


         Between three and fifteen years service, annual leave earned during the last pay period of
         the year is earned at the rate of 12½ percent.
         14.2.3.2. Time of Crediting. The accrued leave is credited to the employee's individual
         leave record upon completion of the 90-calendar day qualifying period; thereafter, at the
         end of the period in which it is earned.
         14.2.3.3. Changes in Rates of Accrual.
            14.2.3.3.1. Changes in the rates of accrual are effective at the beginning of the first
            pay period following the completion of the prescribed service.
            14.2.3.3.2. When a change from a 7 ½ percent to a 10 percent leave category occurs
            at the beginning of the last full biweekly pay period in the leave year, the employee's
            leave credit for that period is computed at 12½ percent of hours in a pay status.
   14.2.4. Accumulation of Annual Leave. The maximum amount of accumulated annual
   leave that may be carried over from one leave year to the next is 30 days (240 hours), except
   in the following instances:
         14.2.4.1. Employees who were directly recruited or transferred by a NAFI from the U.S.
         or its territories or possessions, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, for
         employment overseas or from which transferred and whose condition of employment
         provide for their return transportation to the U.S. or its territories or possessions, may
         accumulate 45 days (360 hours). Upon return to the U.S. or its territories or possessions,
         annual leave accumulated under this provision remains to the credit of the employee until
         used. Upon return from overseas, the maximum annual leave accumulation is 30 days
         (240 hours) or the amount carried over from the previous leave year, whichever is
         greater, not to exceed 45 days (360 hours). For employees who are serving in a position
         in pay band NF-VI, there is a maximum limitation on annual leave accumulation of 90
         days (720 hours) or the amount accumulated under earlier statute, whichever is greater.
         14.2.4.2. On a case-by-case basis and on approval by the commander or director,
         employees may carry leave in excess of 240 or 360 hours, as appropriate, forward into
         the next leave year. The employee must have requested annual leave early in the leave
         year and circumstances beyond the control of management and the employee precluded
         its use before the end of the leave year. Any amount of excess leave carried into the next
         leave year is used within the first 19 pay periods of the leave year or forfeited.
         14.2.4.3. At installations identified for closure, employees may carry forward all earned
         annual leave in excess of 240 hours in accordance with DoDI 1400.25-V1417. An
         installation is considered identified for closure when it appears on the Base Realignment
         and Closure list signed by the President and approved by Congress.
      14.2.5. Payment for Accumulated Annual Leave.
         14.2.5.1. An employee must serve in a regular appointment for a continuous period of
         ninety days before the annual leave he or she earns is available for use. If an employee
         separates before completing ninety days, no leave credit for this period is granted or paid
         as a lump sum.
         14.2.5.2. An employee who has ninety or more days of continuous regular employment
         is paid for all accrued and accumulated annual leave when separating from NAF
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 139


     employment. This lump sum payment is normally included in the employee's final
     paycheck.
     14.2.5.3. Authority to grant annual leave immediately prior to separating from service,
     when separation is known in advance, is limited to cases where the exigencies of the
     employer require such action, or where the employee substantially worked the entire final
     pay period and worked part of the last day of that period in accordance with Decisions of
     the Comptroller General, Volume 34, page 61, 1954. This restriction largely eliminates
     the cost, during employment termination, of employees continuing to accrue leave while
     using leave, and therefore receiving a payoff greater than lump-sum payment of the
     unused leave balance. Annual leave that can be included in the lump-sum leave payment
     is not granted when it is known that the employee will not return to duty, except when the
     employee:
         14.2.5.3.1. Is being separated because of a BBA.
         14.2.5.3.2. Has made an application for disability retirement.
     14.2.5.4. Employees may not be paid for any part of their leave balance at anytime while
     employed unless they are transferred to a position and/or status that is ineligible to accrue
     leave.
  14.2.6. Leave Schedules. Activity managers establish a tentative annual leave schedule
  during January of each year. If possible, employees are allowed to use annual leave
  according to personal desires. First-level supervisors plan for, schedule and approve or
  disapprove annual leave, subject to coordination with the activity manager.
  14.2.7. Requesting Annual Leave.
     14.2.7.1. Except in cases of emergency, annual leave is requested by the employee and
     approved in advance of the absence. Employees submit requests for annual leave on the
     OPM Form 71, Request for Leave or Approved Absence. An employee who takes leave
     without approval is considered Absent Without Approved Leave (AWOL).
     14.2.7.2. Annual leave is taken in increments of 15 minutes, up to 8 hours per day, and
     40 hours per week with exception of those working AWS. For AWS, leave is charged at
     the same number of hours that an employee is scheduled to work.
     14.2.7.3. The use of annual leave other than on those days and for those hours that the
     employee would otherwise work and receive pay is prohibited.
  14.2.8. Advancing Annual Leave. Under usual conditions, advancement of annual leave is
  not granted. However, if conditions warrant, an employee may be granted all annual leave
  which will be earned during the current leave year. In advancing an employee annual leave,
  the supervisor authorized to approve such leave must have reasonable assurance the
  employee will be in a duty status long enough to earn the leave granted before the end of the
  leave year. Supervisors coordinate their decisions to approve or disapprove requests for
  advanced annual leave with the NAF-HR to ensure consistent application of leave policies.
  Employees submit requests for advanced annual leave on the OPM Form 71.
  14.2.9. Refund for Unearned Annual Leave. When an employee is separated before
  earning all the annual leave that has been advanced, usually the value of the unearned leave
  is refunded by the employee or deducted from any compensation due. A refund is not
140                                                        AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      required if the employee is separated for reasons of death, disability retirement or resignation
      for physical disability which is evidenced by acceptable medical documentation.
      14.2.10. Substitution of Annual Leave for LWOP. When LWOP is charged pending
      receipt of an employee's leave record from the former employing installation or agency,
      credited annual leave is substituted for the LWOP upon receipt of the leave record.
      14.2.11. Substitution of Annual Leave for Sick Leave. An employee on extended sick
      leave (including sick leave for maternity reasons) may be granted annual leave to cover any
      part of the absence, provided the request is made in advance. Annual leave cannot be
      substituted retroactively for sick leave previously taken as a means of avoiding a forfeiture of
      annual leave at the end of the leave year. Advanced sick leave is liquidated at the employee's
      request by a substitution of annual leave, provided the substitution is requested before the
      time the annual leave is forfeited.
   14.2.12. Transferring Annual Leave. When a regular employee transfers to another
   AF NAFI, without a break in service, the losing NAFI transfers the total accrued and
   accumulated annual leave balance, together with the funds to cover the dollar value to the
   gaining NAFI. Should the dollar value of the transferred leave balance increase as a result of
   a higher pay rate, the gaining NAFI absorbs the increase. An employee's annual leave hours
   are not adjusted downward to accommodate the transferring dollar value from the losing
   NAFI. If a NAF employee is transferring from one DoD NAFI to another DoD NAFI, the
   employee’s annual leave credit and the funds to cover its cost may be transferred from the
   losing to gaining employer if the two employers agree and the employee elects such a
   transfer of credit instead of receipt of a lump-sum payment.
         14.2.12.1. Employees, including Reservists and National Guard members, entering long-
         term active duty in the Armed Forces may elect to have their accumulated leave remain
         to their credit until they return from active duty or receive lump-sum payment.
         14.2.12.2. A DoD NAF employee who moves to a DoD APF position, without a break in
         service of more than 3 days, shall not be paid lump-sum annual leave. The employee’s
         NAF annual leave balance transfers to the credit in the APF leave system in accordance
         with 5 USC, Chapter 63, Section 6308(b). Leave shall be administered in accordance
         with the rules of the gaining employment system.
14.3. Sick Leave. Sick leave is for absences due to illness, injury, examinations, and treatment
by a physician, exposure to a contagious disease, or illness of a family member with a contagious
disease or for purposes relating to the adoption of a child.
   14.3.1. Eligibility. Sick leave is earned by all regular employees while in a pay status,
   excluding overtime. There is no qualifying period for the crediting of sick leave.
   14.3.2. Sick Leave Accrual. Sick leave is earned at the rate of 5 percent times the hours in a
   pay status, excluding overtime, up to a maximum of 40 hours per week, or eighty hours per
   biweekly pay period.
   14.3.3. Time of Crediting. Sick leave is credited to the employee's individual leave record at
   the end of the period in which it is earned.
   14.3.4. Accumulation of Sick Leave. There is no limit on the amount of sick leave an
   employee may accumulate and carry forward from one year to another. All accumulated sick
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  141


  leave is carried in the employee's leave record until it is used by the employee, or until the
  employee separates from employment.
  14.3.5. Payment for Accumulated Sick Leave. Payment for unused sick leave is not made to
  an employee under any circumstances. Unused sick leave hours are credited toward
  retirement if an employee retires from NAF employment under the NAF retirement program.
  14.3.6. Requesting Sick Leave.
     14.3.6.1. Employees submit requests for sick leave on OPM 71.
     14.3.6.2. Sick leave is taken in 15-minute increments, not to exceed 8 hours per day, or
     40 hours per week with exception of those working AWS. For AWS, leave is charged at
     the same number of hours that an employee is scheduled to work.
     14.3.6.3. An employee is paid sick leave only for those hours scheduled to work for the
     day or week during which the absence occurs.
  14.3.7. Granting Sick Leave.
     14.3.7.1. Sick leave for examinations and treatment by a physician that can be
     prearranged, is requested in advance. Sick leave for other absences, which are not known
     in advance is requested as soon as possible after an employee's scheduled shift begins
     (within the first hour or two). Supervisory approval must be granted before it is taken.
     14.3.7.2. Sick leave of more than three consecutive workdays should be supported by a
     medical certificate. If the employee was not attended by a physician, the employee's
     certification showing satisfactory evidence of incapacitation for duty may be accepted.
     In cases of extended illnesses, medical certificates are not required more frequently than
     every two weeks. Where evidence does not justify the approval of sick leave, the
     absence may be charged to annual leave, LWOP with the employee's consent, or absent
     without leave (AWOL).
     14.3.7.3. If there is reason to believe an employee is abusing sick leave, the supervisor
     advises the employee that he or she has a questionable sick leave record, why the
     employee is suspected of abuse, and if the record does not improve, a medical certificate
     may be required for each future absence on sick leave. If this does not bring about an
     improvement in the record, the employee is notified in writing that all future requests for
     sick leave must be supported by a medical certificate. A written notice of abuse of sick
     leave cannot be issued when the absences claimed on sick leave are documented with
     medical certificates showing incapacity to perform duties of the position.
     14.3.7.4. Sick leave due to exposure to a contagious disease must be supported by a
     medical certificate. An employee who requests sick leave because a family member has
     a contagious disease must present evidence to show that the family member requires the
     employee's care and attendance, as well as the fact that the disease is one that requires
     quarantine or isolation.
  14.3.8. Advancing Sick Leave. Except in cases of serious illness or disability, advanced sick
  leave is not granted. In cases of serious disability, illness, incapacitation, or confinement for
  childbirth, employees may be advanced up to 30 days of sick leave.
142                                                   AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      14.3.8.1. In granting advanced sick leave, consider the employee's prior sick leave
      history; annual leave versus sick leave balance history; length of continuous
      employment; and whether all accumulated sick leave to the employee's credit is
      exhausted. Also, consider requiring the employee to use any annual leave which is
      subject to forfeiture.
      14.3.8.2. Employees submit applications for advanced sick leave on OPM 71.
      Applications must be supported by medical documentation signed by a physician, and
      must include a statement indicating the date the employee is expected to return to normal
      duties.
      14.3.8.3. When it is known that the employee is to be retired or otherwise separated, the
      total advance may not exceed an amount which can be liquidated by accrual before
      separation.
          14.3.8.3.1. Advanced sick leave is not granted if it is considered likely that the
          employee will not return to duty for a sufficient period of time to repay the advanced
          leave.
          14.3.8.3.2. Advanced sick leave is liquidated automatically, but repayment is not
          required when separation is because of death, resignation for disability supported by
          acceptable medical documentation, or disability retirement.
      14.3.8.4. An unliquidated advance is carried forward from pay period to pay period and
      from one leave year to the next until liquidated by subsequent accrual. Upon employee
      request, advanced sick leave is liquidated by a charge to an equivalent amount of annual
      leave. When an employee separates from federal service before liquidating the advance,
      the balance is liquidated in the following order by:
          14.3.8.4.1. Charge against available annual leave.
          14.3.8.4.2. Offset against earned salary.
   14.3.9. Supervisors coordinate their decisions to approve or disapprove requests for
   advanced sick leave with the NAF-HR to ensure consistent application of leave policies.
   14.3.10. Substitution of Sick Leave for Annual Leave. If illness occurs during a period of
   annual leave, approved sick leave may be substituted for annual leave.
  14.3.11. Transferring Sick Leave. On transfer of an employee to another DoD NAF
  employer, the employee’s sick leave credits shall be transferred between the NAF employers
  without a transfer of funds, provided that the employee did not receive service credit for
  unused sick leave in the computation of an annuity.
  14.3.12. Recrediting Sick Leave. Employees who change employment category to an
  ineligible category, and then are changed back to an eligible category have sick leave hours
  recredited without time limitation.
      14.3.12.1. When an employee changes from a regular to a flexible employment category,
      the number of sick leave hours to the employee’s credit are recorded on the SF 1150,
      Record of Leave Data, and filed on the right-hand side of the employee's OPF.
      14.3.12.2. If at a later date, this employee changes back to a regular employment
      category without a break in service with the same or different NAF employer, all sick
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   143


       leave recorded in the OPF on the SF-1150 from the previous change to flexible, is
       recredited to the employee's leave record.
       14.3.12.3. The AF Form 2545 documenting the change to regular employment category
       includes the remark, "Employee entitled to recredit of _______ hours of sick leave." A
       copy of the SF1150 documenting the recreditable sick leave hours, is attached to the AF
       Form 2545 that is forwarded to the NAF AO.
       14.3.12.4. The employing NAFI after the change to regular employment category is
       effective, absorbs all costs associated with the recredited sick leave.
       14.3.12.5. If a former DoD NAF employee returns to DoD NAF employment (regardless
       of employer) after a separation related to a ―Business Based Action (BBA),‖ as defined in
       DoD 1401.1-M, Personnel Policy for Nonappropriated Fund Instumentalities (NAFIs),
       his or her sick leave balance at the time of such separation shall be restored. If separation
       was not related to a BBA, restoring the balance of the sick leave is at the discretion of the
       employer.
   14.3.13. Sick Leave for Adoption. Sick leave is justified for an activity that is necessary to
   allow an adoption to proceed. The following adoption-related activities are covered:
       14.3.13.1. Appointments with adoption agencies, social workers, and attorneys.
       14.3.13.2. Court proceedings.
       14.3.13.3. Required travel to and from justified adoption-related activities.
       14.3.13.4. There is no provision to permit use of sick leave by birth parent(s) or adoptive
       parent(s) who choose, on their own, to be absent from work to bond with a birth or
       adopted child. However, if a court or adoption agency requires in writing that adoptive
       parent(s) take a specific period of time off to care for or bond with the child, sick leave
       can be granted.
       14.3.13.5. There is no specific limitation on the number of sick leave hours that can be
       requested and taken for adoption purposes. However, an employee may not take more
       hours than are accrued and available in the employee’s sick leave account.
       14.3.13.6. Requests for sick leave for adoption purposes are made using OPM 71 are
       submitted in advance, and are subject to the approval of the supervisor or designated
       leave-approving official.
14.4. On-the-Job Injury. An employee covered by Workers’ Compensation Insurance may be
granted sick leave payments from the employee’s accumulated sick leave balance in an amount
which, when added to Workers’ Compensation Benefits, approximates but does not exceed the
employee’s basic salary. Annual leave may be substituted in the absence of sick leave.
14.4.1. LWOP. LWOP is a temporary nonpay status and an authorized absence from duty
granted upon the employee's request, or when the employee has insufficient annual or sick leave,
or compensatory time available to cover an approved absence. An employee does not have to
exhaust annual leave before requesting LWOP. LWOP cannot be imposed as a penalty, nor can
an employee be required to apply for LWOP in lieu of suspension. It must not be confused with
AWOL, which is charged for unauthorized absence. The granting of LWOP is a matter of
administrative discretion. The NAF-HR must counsel the employee requesting LWOP, who is
144                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


enrolled in the group health and life insurance plans, on his/her responsibility for remitting
his/her share of the contribution during the period of LWOP (see paragraph 14.4.3.8.1.3.).
   14.4.1.1. Requesting and Approving LWOP. Employees submit requests for LWOP on
   OPM 71. Activity managers approve LWOP up to and including 30 days. The commander
   or director approves LWOP over 30 days. LWOP is charged in 15-minute increments.
   LWOP shall not be granted for a period exceeding 1 year except for military service and
   other circumstances considered appropriate.
   14.4.2. Refer to Chapter 6 for procedures for LWOP for career program employees affected
   by a BBA separation.
   14.4.3. LWOP for Regular Employees Moving With Head of Household.
       14.4.3.1. A regular employee is entitled to LWOP for up to 150 calendar days in order to
       avoid a break in service when resigning from his or her position due to an employer’s
       transfer of the head of household if the regular employee is the family member of either:
           14.4.3.1.1. A military member who is head of household;
           14.4.3.1.2. A federally employed person who is the head of household; or,
           14.4.3.1.3. A non-federally employed person who is the head of household,
           (hereinafter referred to as "sponsor").
       14.4.3.2. These provisions do not apply to an employee relocating with their spouse who
       is retiring from active duty.
       14.4.3.3. LWOP is a temporary nonpay status and an authorized absence from duty
       granted upon an employee's request. An employee granted LWOP according to these
       procedures, receives no special employment consideration as a result of this LWOP
       status. The losing installation may fill the employee's position immediately, and no other
       installation is obligated to hire the employee by virtue of the employee's LWOP status.
       14.4.3.4. An employee returning from an overseas assignment for separation, at the
       NAFIs expense, is not entitled to LWOP under these procedures.
       14.4.3.5. Requests for LWOP under these procedures must be approved by the FSS
       commander/director, documented by an AF Form 2545, and made a matter of record in
       the OPF.
       14.4.3.6. Employee Responsibilities.
           14.4.3.6.1. Employees submit request for LWOP to his or her supervisor on OPM 71.
           The employee also submits evidence acceptable to the approving authority, that the
           employee's sponsor is being transferred by the sponsor's employer.
           14.4.3.6.2. After the approving authority approves the request, the employee submits
           to his or her supervisor, his or her resignation by completing Part III of AF Form
           2548. The resignation takes effect on the last day of the LWOP period, unless the
           employee is appointed to another position prior to the expiration of the LWOP period,
           in which case, the resignation does not take effect. The employee must include a
           forwarding address on the AF Form 2548.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 145


        14.4.3.6.3. If, during the LWOP period, the employee seeks other NAF employment,
        the employee submits a copy of the AF Form 2545, documenting the LWOP status,
        with his or her application for employment. (The employee receives the AF Form
        2545 from the losing NAF-HR. Refer to paragraph 14.4.3.8.2.)
     14.4.3.7. Supervisor Responsibilities.
        14.4.3.7.1. Upon receipt of an employee's OPM 71 request for LWOP, the supervisor
        forwards the request, through the appropriate channel to the FSS commander/director
        for approval.
        14.4.3.7.2. After the FSS commander/director approves the request, the supervisor
        ensures the employee submits a resignation.
        14.4.3.7.3. Upon receipt of the Resignation AF Form 2548, the supervisor completes
        (a) Parts I and IV of the form and (b) another AF Form 2548 documenting the
        LWOP, and submits both forms to the NAF-HR.
     14.4.3.8. Losing NAF-HR Responsibilities. Upon receipt of the two AF Forms 2548-
     one documenting the resignation and one documenting the LWOP-the losing NAF-HR
     takes the following actions:
        14.4.3.8.1. Counsel the employee about the following matters:
            14.4.3.8.1.1. The LWOP period will not be creditable toward any of the age,
            service, or participation requirements for benefits of the retirement, 401(k), or
            group insurance plans if the employee is not appointed to another position in
            which he or she is eligible for participation, and continues his or her participation,
            in the appropriate benefit plan.
            14.4.3.8.1.2. Retirement and 401(k) Plans.
               14.4.3.8.1.2.1. Retirement Plan.          Both the employer and employee
               contributions are discontinued during the LWOP period. The employee's
               eligibility for retirement plan benefits and options is determined and AF Form
               2391, Termination Information, is completed reflecting the employee's
               election in the event he or she is not appointed to another NAF position prior
               to expiration of the LWOP. If the employee elects either retirement or the
               deferred annuity option, AF Form 2395, Evidence of Age, must be completed.
               If the employee is under age 62, AF Form 1528, Authorization to Obtain
               Social Security Earnings Information, is also completed.
               14.4.3.8.1.2.2. 401(k) Plan. Both the employer and employee contributions
               are discontinued during the LWOP period. The termination distribution form
               should be completed reflecting the employee’s election in the event he or she
               is not appointed to another NAF position prior to expiration of the LWOP.
            14.4.3.8.1.3. Group Health and Life Insurance Plans:
               14.4.3.8.1.3.1. If the employee is participating in either the group health
               insurance plan or the group life insurance plan, and if the employee wishes to
               continue such participation during the LWOP period, the employee must,
               during the LWOP period, continue to remit the employee's share of the
146                                               AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


             contributions required by such participation to the losing NAF AO. If the
             employee does not wish to continue participation during the LWOP period,
             the NAF-HR prepares AF Form 2545 to terminate the coverage prior to
             processing the LWOP action. In this case, complete the carrier change form
             according to pre-established procedures furnished by the Insurance Branch.
             Send the change form to the carrier. Maintain a copy of the form in the
             employee’s OPF.
             14.4.3.8.1.3.2. If the employee fails to pay his or her share of the
             contribution, and the employee's account is not current at the end of the pay
             period following the pay period in which insufficient funds were received, the
             NAF-HR will process the deduction arrearages report obtained through
             AFSFMS Reporting Tool to identify employees with insufficient funds and
             prepares AF Form 2545 to terminate the coverage. The effective date of
             termination is the first day of the pay period immediately following the pay
             period in which insufficient funds were received from the employee. A copy
             of the AF Form 2545 must be sent to HQ AFSVA/SVXHI and to the
             employee at the forwarding address provided on the AF Form 2548. If the
             employee was enrolled in the NAF group health benefits program, complete
             the carrier change form according to pre-established procedures furnished by
             the Insurance Branch. Send the change form to the carrier; maintain a copy of
             the form in the employee’s OPF.
             14.4.3.8.1.3.3. The employee must also be counseled on the different group
             insurance conversion and continuing coverage options for which he or she
             would be eligible upon termination of his or her LWOP.
         14.4.3.8.1.4. Annual Leave.        Normally, annual leave is not granted in
         conjunction with LWOP. If, on the effective date of the resignation, the employee
         has annual leave to his or her credit, the losing NAF-HR either (1) ensures
         payment of lump sum annual leave or (2) if the employee is subsequently hired
         into an eligible position, transfers the leave balance to the employee's account
         with the new position. If the LWOP period will potentially extend into a new
         leave year, and if the employee's annual leave balance exceeds that which may be
         carried from one leave year to the next, the NAF-HR informs the employee how
         to avoid the loss of accrued annual leave.
      14.4.3.8.2. Process the Request for LWOP. Upon receipt of the LWOP AF Form
      2548, the losing NAF-HR prepares an AF Form 2545 documenting the LWOP period
      and gives a copy of the form to the employee prior to the employee's departure from
      the area. If the employee is participating in the NAF retirement plan, or either of the
      NAF group insurance plans, the NAF-HR forwards a copy of the LWOP AF Form
      2545 to HQ AFSVA/SVXHB. The employee remains an active employee at the
      losing installation until either the effective date of the Transfer Out or
      Resignation/Retirement action. The NAF-HR suspenses the LWOP action to ensure
      the required subsequent actions are taken in a timely manner.
      14.4.3.8.3. Process the Resignation.
         14.4.3.8.3.1. If the losing NAF-HR is notified that the employee has obtained
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                             147


          other employment prior to the expiration of the LWOP period, the losing NAF-
          HR prepares an AF Form 2545, indicating that the employee transferred, effective
          the day before the effective day of the new appointment. The appropriate NOA
          and Code to be inserted in Blocks 11a and b are N049, Transfer Out. Refer to the
          DCPDS Users Guide for guidance regarding the appropriate remarks to be
          included in Block 25. The remarks vary depending upon the new appointment.
          For example, if the new appointment is to a regular NAF position, block 25
          includes the remark that all annual and sick leave account balances transfer; but if
          the appointment is to a flexible NAF position, Block 25 indicates that any annual
          leave balance is paid lump sum. A copy of the AF Form 2545 is sent to the
          employee at the forwarding address provided by the employee.
             14.4.3.8.3.1.1. The NAF-HR processes this transfer action through the
             DCPDS immediately upon notification of the new appointment. The gaining
             NAF-HR cannot process the appointment action in DCPDS until the transfer
             out action processes.
             14.4.3.8.3.1.2. The NAF-HR prepares an SF 1150 for the employee's OPF.
             14.4.3.8.3.1.3. If the employee is participating in the NAF retirement plan, or
             either of the NAF group insurance plans, HQ AFSVA/SVXHB will be
             notified through DCPDS.
          14.4.3.8.3.2. If the LWOP period expires, and the losing NAF-HR has not been
          notified that the employee obtained other employment prior to the expiration of
          the LWOP period, the losing NAF-HR prepares an AF Form 2545, indicating the
          employee resigned or retired, effective the last day of the LWOP period. The
          appropriate NOA and Codes for blocks 11a and b are N030, Resignation or N043,
          Retirement-Voluntary. Insert in Block 25 all appropriate remarks required for
          processing the resignation or retirement of any regular employee. Refer to the
          DCPDS Users Guide for guidance. A copy of the AF Form 2545 along with SF-
          8, Notice to Federal Employee about Unemployment Compensation, is sent to the
          employee at the forwarding address provided by the employee.
             14.4.3.8.3.2.1. If the employee was a participant in the NAF retirement plan,
             forward a copy of the AF Form 2545 and other appropriate documentation
             (see paragraph 14.4.3.7.1.2) to HQ AFSVA/SVXHB. If the employee has
             elected retirement or the deferred annuity option, include copies of all AF
             Forms 2545 required to document the employee's high three earnings, along
             with the number of hours of unused sick leave upon retirement. If the
             employee was a participant in the NAF 401(k) plan, forward a copy of the
             termination distribution form according to AFI 34-315, Air Force
             Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Employees 401(k) Savings Plan.
             14.4.3.8.3.2.2. If the employee continued participation in one or both of the
             NAF group insurance plans during the full period of the LWOP, forward a
             copy of the AF Form 2545, with documentation pertaining to the employee's
             eligibility for continuing coverage along with Aetna Form GR-65989-1, to

       14.4.3.9. Gaining NAF-HR Responsibilities.
           14.4.3.9.1. Obtain a copy of the AF Form 2545 documenting the LWOP status of the
           employee. The employee should be able to provide such copy.
           14.4.3.9.2. If the LWOP period has expired before the effective date of the new
           appointment, treat the employee as you would any former employee being rehired
           with a break in service, and prepare the AF Form 2545 appropriately.
           14.4.3.9.3. If the LWOP period has not expired before the effective date of the new
           appointment, prepare AF Form 2545, indicating the employee transferred. The
           appropriate NOA and Code to be inserted in Blocks 11a and b are N021, Transfer In.
           Refer to the DCPDS Users Guide for guidance regarding the appropriate remarks to
           be included in Block 25. These remarks will vary depending upon the new
           appointment. For example, if the new appointment is to a regular NAF position,
           Block 25 includes the remarks that all annual and sick leave balances transfer; that
           participation in the NAF retirement plan and group insurance programs, if applicable,
           continues; and that no 90-day waiting period for annual leave usage is required.
           14.4.3.9.4. If the employee elected to continue participation in either or both of the
           group insurance plans during the LWOP period, verify with the losing NAF-HR that
           the employee continued to remit his or her share of the contribution, and that their
           account is current and insurance coverage is not terminated.
           14.4.3.9.5. Request the employee's OPF from the losing NAF-HR.
           14.4.3.9.6. Do not process the Transfer In action through DCPDS until notified that
           the losing NAF-HR has processed the Transfer Out action.
14.5. AWOL. AWOL is an unauthorized absence from duty or for which leave is denied. This
is a non-pay status. These unauthorized absences may form the basis for disciplinary action.
14.6. Military Leave. Military leave is absence from duty in the employee's NAF position
without loss of pay to perform military duty. Regular employees and Flexible employees are
entitled to time off with pay for certain types of active and inactive duty in the National Guard or
the Reserves of the Armed Forces. Military leave is prorated for eligible Flexible employees
based on the number of hours in the employee’s regularly scheduled bi-weekly pay period.
Additional information may be found at www.opm.gov. Eligible employees must, upon request,
be granted military leave to which entitled for performance of active duty or active duty for
training. If an employee is ordered to an initial period of active duty for training with the
Reserve or National Guard for a period of not less than three months, the employee may be
granted annual leave or LWOP as requested, after first exhausting military leave.
   14.6.1. Eligibility Criteria. Employees entitled to military leave must be:
       14.6.1.1. A member of a Reserve or National Guard component.
       14.6.1.2. Serving in an appointment that is not limited term for 1 year or less.
   14.6.2. Entitlement to Military Leave.
       14.6.2.1. Eligible employees are entitled to an excused absence up to a maximum of 15
       workdays per fiscal year without loss of pay, leave, or performance rating when called to
       active duty or active duty for training. Eligible employees accrue 15 workdays of
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  149


     military leave per fiscal year. If the full 15 workdays is not used in any fiscal year, the
     balance of the unused leave (up to a maximum of 15 workdays) is carried forward into
     the next leave year. Therefore, an eligible employee could have a maximum total of 30
     workdays credited for use during a fiscal year. Title 5 USC 6323(b) provides 22
     workdays per calendar year for emergency duty as ordered by the President, the Secretary
     of Defense, or a State Governor. This leave is provided for employees who perform
     military duties in support of civil authorities in the protection of life and property or who
     perform full-time military service as a result of a call or order to active duty in support of
     a contingency operation as defined in section 101(a)(13) of title 10, United States Code.
     Title 5 USC 6323(d) provides unlimited military leave to members of the National Guard
     of the District of Columbia for certain types of duty ordered or authorized under title 39
     of the District of Columbia Code.
     14.6.2.2. Regular employees called into active duty for the purpose of performing
     military duties in support of civil authorities in the protection of life and property may be
     granted additional military leave not to exceed twenty-two workdays in a fiscal year.
     These employees are granted leave upon presentation of official orders. Compensation
     (other than for travel, transportation, or per diem allowance) received is turned in to the
     NAFI to be credited toward the pay received from the employee's NAF position, during
     the employee's absence to perform this military duty. This leave is granted only for
     workdays, and the employee's NAF pay is reduced only by the amount received for
     military service performed on a workday.
     14.6.2.3. Employees are paid by the NAFI while on military leave as provided in para
     14.6.2.1.
  14.6.3. Granting Military Leave. An eligible employee is granted any military leave
  available to them when ordered to active duty. Neither annual leave nor LWOP is granted
  for such active duty until the employee uses all the military leave available to him or her
  unless this would result in a forfeiture of annual leave. Requests for military leave are
  supported by a copy of the orders, which is forwarded to the NAF AO with the time and
  attendance card on which the absence is first reported. The employee submits a certification
  by the appropriate military officer as evidence that the active military duty was performed.
  This certification is forwarded to the NAF AO for coordination with the paying office.
  14.6.4. Charging Military Leave. Military leave is charged only for hours during which a
  civilian employee would otherwise have been scheduled to work and receive pay. No charge
  is made for non-workdays at the beginning and end of a period of absence on active military
  duty. Neither is there a charge for weekends and holidays that occur within the period of
  military service.
  14.6.5. LWOP Criteria. LWOP may be granted for:
     14.6.5.1. Employees who are members of the Reserve or National Guard who are not
     eligible for, or who have exhausted his or her military leave, as requested, for active or
     inactive duty for training.
     14.6.5.2. Summer training as members of Reserve Officers Training Corps.
     14.6.5.3. Temporary Coast Guard Reserve Duty.
150                                                       AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


         14.6.5.4. Participation in parades by members of a state National Guard. Members of the
         National Guard in the District of Columbia are entitled to military leave with pay for
         participation in parades.
         14.6.5.5. Training with a state Guard or other state military organization.
         14.6.5.6. Civil Air Patrol duty.
14.7. Excused Absence for Employees Returning from Active Duty. When employees return
to duty from Military Service, they shall have the same leave accrual entitlements they should
have enjoyed had they remained at work in accordance with the Uniform Services Employment
and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, codified in Section 4316 of title 38 U.S.C. Additionally,
as directed in the Presidential Memorandum, dated November 14, 2003, employees returning
from active Military Service in connection with Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Enduring
Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, or any other military operation subsequently established
under Executive Order 13223 shall be granted five workdays of excused absence regardless of
the number of active duty activations. Employees who were not appointed in their NAF position
at the time of military activation are not eligible for the excused absence. The period of excused
absence is prorated according to the number of hours in the employee’s regularly scheduled
workweek. Flexible employees are entitled to the average number of hours in their weekly work
schedule prior to being activated. The excused absence is granted prior to the employee’s
resumption of their civilian duties.
14.8. Military Furlough. Military furlough is granted to all employees for induction or recall
to active duty in one of the Armed Forces. An employee returned to duty from military furlough
has the same seniority, status, pay and, if appropriate, leave accrual entitlements that the
employee would have enjoyed had he or she remained on the job. Refer to Chapter three for the
procedures for this type of absence.
14.9. Court Leave. Court leave is an authorized absence from duty without loss of pay or
charge to annual leave to perform jury duty in a federal, state, or municipal court or to serve in
an unofficial capacity as a witness on behalf of the U.S. Government, the District of Columbia,
or state or local government. All regular employees are eligible for court leave.
      14.9.1. Granting Court Leave. Court leave is granted for absence during an employee's
      regularly scheduled tour of duty. It is granted only for those days and hours the employee
      would otherwise be in a pay status. An employee is not granted court leave for jury or
      witness duty performed within a period of nonpay status. Employees assigned to night shifts
      are granted court leave comparable with employees assigned to regular day shift work. Since
      jury duty generally requires an employee's presence in court during daytime hours, an
      employee scheduled to work at night is granted court leave during the days on which the
      night shift begins or ends. If he or she works during part of the regularly scheduled night
      shift, only that part of the regularly scheduled shift during which the employee is absent is
      charged to court leave. If he or she works his or her regular night shift, no court leave is
      charged.
   14.9.2. Return to Duty Upon Release by Court. An employee properly summoned to
   serve on a jury is under the jurisdiction and control of the court for the term of the jury
   service. However, an employee is expected to return to duty during periods when he or she
   is excused from jury duty unless this would be impractical. An employee excused or
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   151


   discharged by the court either for an indefinite period, or for a definite period in excess of
   one day or a substantial portion of one day, is not entitled to court leave, but must report to
   duty. As a general rule, if there are four or more hours remaining in the employee's workday,
   exclusive of reasonable travel time, the employee reports for duty. If the employee fails to
   report for duty as directed, annual leave, LWOP, or AWOL is charged for the excess time
   involved.
   14.9.3. Witness and Jury Fees. An employee is entitled to receive and retain expenses paid
   for services rendered and reimbursement for travel expenses. When a state or local court
   characterizes jury and witness fees as expenses, there is no requirement for the employee to
   turn in such fees to the agency. The employee cannot retain fees received in most
   circumstances. The certificate of attendance should separately identify fees and
   expenses/allowances. Fees received by the employee are collected while the expenses are
   not. If the certificate of attendance does not identify expenses separately, all monies are
   considered fees and shall be collected. The employee must submit fees received for jury or
   witness services by money order or personal check to the servicing NAF AO. The employee
   may keep reimbursements for expenses received from the court, authority, or party that
   caused the employee to be summoned and may keep fees that exceed the employee’s
   compensation for the days of service. An employee serving on a jury in a state or local court
   who waives or refuses to accept fees is still liable to the NAFI for the fees he or she would
   have received. Fees not submitted in a timely manner are subject to payroll deduction.
   Payroll deductions to collect the fees will be made in the next regular pay period. If fees are
   erroneously paid to an employee by the court, the fees paid cannot be retained by the
   employee and must be turned in to the employing activity. When a holiday occurs during the
   time an employee is on jury duty or witness service, the employee can keep the jury duty or
   witness service fee for the holiday. If an employee is called to jury duty on a non-workday,
   or during a non-pay status, the employee may keep the fees paid.
14.10. Administrative Leave. Administrative leave is an absence from duty when employees
are released because all or part of an activity is closed or it is in the public interest. Employees
affected by these actions are usually excused without loss of pay.
   14.10.1. Installation commanders may suspend some or all NAFI operations when severe
   weather conditions or other emergency situations dictate such action as being in the best
   interest of the AF. Under such conditions:
       14.10.1.1. Regular employees on duty at the time operations are suspended, are released
       from duty without charge to leave.
       14.10.1.2. Flexible employees on duty at the time operations are suspended, are released
       from duty on LWOP for the remainder of their scheduled shift.
       14.10.1.3. Employees who are notified of suspended operations well enough in advance
       to permit the scheduling of leave, normally 24 hours in advance, are not released without
       charge to leave.
       14.10.1.4. Employees on approved leave, i.e., annual, sick, LWOP, etc., when operations
       are suspended continue to be charged leave. Administrative leave is not applicable.
14.11. Excused Absences. Excused absence is an administratively authorized absence from
duty without loss of pay or charge to leave. Excused absence differs from administrative
152                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


dismissal in that it normally addresses individual employees excused for non-mission related
emergency reasons, such as notification periods prior to a removal action, or for reasons the
government encourages such as voting, etc. as approved by the supervisor.
      14.11.1. Absence for Brief Periods or Tardiness. Unavoidable absence of less than 1
      hour, and brief periods of tardiness may be excused by the supervisor for adequate reasons.
      14.11.2. Absence for Voting or Registration. Activities maintain up-to-date information as
      to voting hours in all political subdivisions in which their employees reside. This
      information is made available to employees, because it is used as the basis for determining
      the amount of excused absence granted to employees.
         14.11.2.1. Employees requesting time off to vote are excused without charge to leave for
         the amount of time necessary to permit them to report to work three hours after the polls
         open or to leave work three hours before the polls close, whichever requires the least
         amount of time off. No time off is granted if the polls are open either three hours before
         or three hours after the employee’s regular duty hours.
         14.11.2.2. Employees voting in jurisdictions where registration in person is required are
         granted time off to register on substantially the same basis as for voting. However, no
         time off is granted without charge to leave if the employee can register on a non-workday
         and round trip travel can reasonably be accomplished in one day.
   14.11.3. Blood Donations. Employees are encouraged to volunteer as blood donors for
   unpaid donations. An employee is excused without charge to leave for the time necessary to
   donate blood, for recuperation following the donation, and for necessary travel to and from
   the donation site. The maximum time allowed without charge to leave is 4 hours.
   14.11.4. Consultation With Operating Officials and the NAF-HR. Do not charge an
   employee leave for the time required to consult with operating officials or with the staff of
   the NAF-HR on matters relating to their employment provided that arrangements satisfactory
   to the supervisor and the official to be consulted with are made in advance.
   14.11.5. Medical Examinations for Employment. An employee required to take a medical
   examination to determine his or her fitness for employment, or who obtains other medical
   services administered as a part of the health program of the activity, is considered in duty
   status during the time necessary to obtain the examination or treatment.
   14.11.6. Attending Meetings and Conferences. Absence, including required travel time,
   during normal duty hours to attend meetings or conferences determined to be training, or
   absence to attend other meetings for which travel is authorized at government expense is
   considered official duty and no charge is made to leave. Employees are not excused to attend
   conferences or conventions of political parties or partisan political groups or committees.
   14.11.7. Holiday Observance.
         14.11.7.1. Legal Holidays. Employees are not required to work on a legal holiday
         unless their services are required to carry out essential operations. However,
         unauthorized absence on a holiday on which the employee was required to work results in
         loss of pay for that day, and could result in disciplinary action.
         14.11.7.2. Religious Observance. There are no official observances of religious
         holidays. Employees who request to observe religious holidays may be allowed time off
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                153


     for that purpose and the absence charged to annual leave or LWOP. If circumstances
     permit, work schedules may be rearranged to provide substituted work time. An
     employee may also request to perform compensatory overtime work for the purpose of
     taking compensatory time off in lieu of annual leave, when his or her personal religious
     beliefs require them to be absent from work for religious observance as provided in para
     18.15.2.
  14.11.8. Military Funerals.
     14.11.8.1. An employee who is a veteran of the Armed Forces and who participates as a
     pall bearer, a member of a firing squad, or a member of an honor guard in funerals for
     members of the Armed Forces who lost their lives on active duty is excused from duty
     without charge to leave, but not in excess of four hours in one day.
     14.11.8.2. An employee is excused for not more than three workdays to make
     arrangements for, or to attend the funeral or memorial service of an immediate relative
     (spouse, son, daughter, mother, father, brother, or sister) who dies while on active duty as
     the result of wounds, disease, or injury incurred while serving in the Armed Forces in a
     combat zone.
  14.11.9. Absences in Connection With Permanent Duty Travel. An employee is not
  charged leave for any absence necessary to comply with requirements imposed in connection
  with a PCS. An employee with permanent change of duty station (PCS) orders may be
  granted excused absence to make personal arrangements and transact personal business
  directly related to the permanent change in duty station, provided that such business or
  arrangements cannot be transacted outside regular working hours. This includes such things
  as closing and opening personal bank accounts, or obtaining a driver’s license and auto tags.
  This provision does not cover time involved in complying with PCS requirements such as
  obtaining passport and vaccinations, adhering to government housing authority requirements,
  or being present for packing and receiving of household goods. Such tasks required by the
  PCS are considered to be official duties. For an assignment to or return from, overseas
  employment, official duties further include time spent to deliver or reclaim privately owned
  vehicle (POV) to or from the port facility, obtain required physical examination, vaccination
  and inoculation, or passport, or to comply with other special requirements imposed because
  of the overseas assignment, including absence to obtain travel orders. An employee required
  to report to another activity to comply with overseas processing requirements is not charged
  leave for any absence necessary to make the trip. Excused absence or official duty time only
  applies to the employee for whom PCS orders has been authorized and not to any civilian
  employees who may be listed on the orders as dependents.
     14.11.9.1. When extensive permanent change of duty travel outside of regularly
     scheduled hours of duty is required, employees are authorized to be absent from work
     without charge to leave or loss of pay for a reasonable time to recuperate from fatigue or
     loss of sleep. In determining ―reasonable time‖ the supervisor considers the adverse
     effect on work performance, health, or well-being, and any safety hazard which might
     result from working while fatigued. Normally, this should not exceed 4 hours. When the
     total elapsed travel time exceeds 20 consecutive hours, as in the case of travel between
     the continental United States and either Pacific or European bases, up to 8 hours of duty
     time may be excused for recuperation.
154                                                     AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


   14.11.10. Bone-Marrow or Organ Donations. An employee may use up to seven days of
   paid leave each calendar year to serve as a bone-marrow donor. Such additional leave is
   granted without loss of or reduction in pay, leave to which otherwise entitled, credit for time
   or service, or performance rating. An employee also may use up to 30 days of paid leave
   each calendar year to serve as an organ donor. Leave for bone marrow and organ donation is
   a separate category of leave that is in addition to annual and sick leave. NAF-HRs shall
   inform employees of this entitlement.
       14.11.10.1. Bone-marrow or organ donor leave may be used, but is not limited to, such
       situations as blood testing, tissue testing, counseling, physical examinations, travel time,
       surgery, and recuperation. Employees who are screened, but not accepted as donors, are
       entitled to bone-marrow or organ donor leave for their absences in conjunction with their
       attempt to be donors.
       14.11.10.2. Record this type of leave on the time and attendance documentation under
       administrative or other leave category. The minimum charge for this type of paid leave is
       the same minimum charge that applies to sick leave (minimum incremental charge of 15
       minutes NTE 8 hours per day, or 40 hours per week with exception of AWS). The
       authorized days of paid leave shall be converted to hours (i.e., 56 hours for an employee
       working 80 hours in a biweekly pay period and serving as a bone-marrow donor or 240
       hours for an employee working 80 hours in a biweekly pay period and serving as an
       organ donor).
       14.11.10.3. An employee having bone-marrow removed and stored for future use is not a
       "donor," and the benefit of 7 days of paid time off was not intended for someone who is
       undergoing such a procedure for his or her own needs. Sick leave, annual leave, and
       advanced annual and sick leave are available to an employee facing this type of medical
       procedure. In addition, leave donated under the voluntary leave transfer program (VLTP)
       and LWOP under the FMLA may be used if the condition meets the requirements of
       these programs.
14.12. Parental Leave. Parental leave covers absences for pregnancy and confinement, leave
for adoptive parents, and paternity leave. Management should be responsive and compassionate
in leave policies for working parents. Requests for such leave should be granted to the extent
that normal work requirements permit. Refer to paragraph 14.16 for guidance on the Family and
Medical Leave Act (FMLA).
   14.12.1. Absence for Maternity Reasons. Absence from duty for reasons related to
   pregnancy and confinement is charged to sick leave, annual leave, or LWOP, depending on
   the circumstances and availability of each type of leave. The employee is responsible for
   providing notice substantially in advance of the anticipated leave dates. Requests for sick
   leave are treated the same as any request for leave to cover a medically certified temporary
   disability. All sick leave requests are supported by medical documentation showing the
   employee is incapacitated to perform the duties of his or her position for the period covered
   by the certificate. Sick leave is not authorized for absence due solely to the employee's
   responsibility for care of the infant. Any additional absence not supported by medical
   documentation is charged to annual leave or LWOP. If the employee requests additional
   annual leave or LWOP following confinement in order to care for the infant, supervisors
   should make every effort to approve the request.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 155


   14.12.2. Absence for Paternity Reasons. A male employee may use sick leave, annual
   leave, or LWOP for the purpose of caring for his minor children or the mother of his
   newborn child during confinement or incapacitation due to complications arising from the
   delivery. Requests of this nature should be handled in accordance with paragraphs 14.2, and
   14.3, or 14.4.1.
14.13. Forced Leave. Management uses forced leave when reduced or suspended business
operations result in temporarily reduced or suspended work schedules. It is usually LWOP,
which temporarily places an employee in a nonwork, nonpay status; however, regular employees
may take annual leave instead of LWOP.
   14.13.1. Reasons for forced leave include lack of business, slow business or facility repair or
   remodeling. Forced leave may also be required when business operations are temporarily
   reduced or suspended due to facility damage, breakdowns in equipment, power outage, or
   other unforeseeable curtailment of activities, excluding those circumstances explained in
   paragraph 14.10.
   14.13.2. When an employee's work hours are temporarily reduced for one workday or more,
   the procedures in table 14.1 are used. When an employee's work schedule is suspended
   temporarily, the procedures in table 14.2 are used. Coordinate notices with the NAF-HR.
   14.13.3. When a written notice is required, it is coordinated with the NAF-HR and includes:
       14.13.3.1. A statement that the employee's work hours or work schedule is temporarily
       reduced or suspended.
       14.13.3.2. The number of hours reduced, or the length of time the work schedule is
       temporarily suspended.
       14.13.3.3. If the work schedule is suspended, the date the suspended work schedule
       begins and the date the employee is to return to work.
       14.13.3.4. The specific reason for the suspended schedule.
       14.13.3.5. A statement to regular employees that annual leave may be taken instead of
       LWOP.

14.14. Voluntary Leave Transfer Program (VLTP).
     14.14.1. Scope and Applicability. VLTPs are established on an installation-wide basis and
     operate under the jurisdiction of the Squadron commander or director. Only regular NAF
     employees, who earn sick and annual leave, are eligible to participate. Leave cannot be
     donated to flexible employees, who are ineligible to earn paid leave.
     14.14.2. Description of the Program. The VLTP permits AF NAF employees to donate
     annual leave to other AF NAF employees at the same installation who suffer a substantial
     loss of income, because they have insufficient sick and annual leave to cover a lengthy period
     of absence caused by a medical emergency. A leave recipient may use annual leave received
     under this program in the same manner and the same purposes as if the leave recipient had
     accrued the leave, except that any annual leave, and any sick leave, accrued or accumulated
     by the leave recipient and available for the purpose involved must be exhausted before any
     transferred annual leave may be used. The requirement relating to exhaustion of annual and
     sick leave shall not apply in the case of a leave recipient who (1) sustains a combat-related
     disability while a member of the armed forces, including a reserve component of the armed
     forces; and (2) is undergoing medical treatment for that disability. This is applicable only so
     long as the member continues to undergo medical treatment for the disability, but in no event
158                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      for longer than 5 years. Affected employees submit an application through the first-level
      supervisor to the approving official. The VLTP is not used to cover absences of 80 hours or
      less; such absences can be covered by advancing leave to the affected employee, or by
      LWOP.
      14.14.3. Definitions.
         14.14.3.1. Approving Official. The individual who has final authority to approve or
         disapprove VLTP applications. The FSS commander/director at base level, or the higher
         headquarters equivalent at MAJCOMs, DRUs, and FOAs.
         14.14.3.2. Leave Donor. An employee who submits a voluntary written request to
         transfer a specific number of accrued annual leave hours to the annual leave account of a
         leave recipient.
         14.14.3.3. Leave Recipient. A regular NAF employee whose application to receive
         annual leave from leave donors is approved.
         14.14.3.4. Medical Emergency. A documented medical condition of an employee or an
         immediate family member of such employee that is likely to require an employee's
         absence from duty for a prolonged period of time (in excess of eighty hours), and that
         results in a substantial loss of income to the employee because of the unavailability of
         paid leave.
         14.14.3.5. VLTP Eligible Employee. A regular NAF employee who accumulates sick
         and annual leave.
  14.14.4. Employee Application Procedures.
         14.14.4.1. An employee makes written application to the first-level supervisor to become
         a leave recipient. If the employee is not capable of making application on his or her own
         behalf, a personal representative of the potential leave recipient may make written
         application for the employee. The application is submitted on OPM 630, Application to
         Become a Leave Recipient Under the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program.
         14.14.4.2. Additional documentation will include:
             14.14.4.2.1. The employee's relationship to the family member; e.g., spouse, child,
             parent, etc., if the medical condition pertains to a family member.
             14.14.4.2.2. If the exact amount is not known, an estimate of the amounts of leave.
             A copy of the latest leave record can be attached to the memorandum, if available.
             14.14.4.2.3. Certification from one or more physicians, or other appropriate experts,
             with respect to the medical emergency, or any additional information that is required
             to support the request.
             14.14.4.2.4. If there is any information in the application or the attachments that the
             employee wants kept private, this should be mentioned in the application. The
             supervisor advises the employee whether withholding the information will adversely
             affect efforts to solicit leave donations.
             14.14.4.2.5. A statement that the employee understands that he or she must use all
             existing annual and sick leave before any donated leave from other employees is
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               159


         used, and that donated leave is not used to compute a lump sum leave payment if the
         employee is separated.
  14.14.5. Supervisory Action on Applications. The first-level supervisor reviews the
  application for completeness and accuracy. When the application is found to be acceptable,
  the supervisor, within five calendar days, endorses the OPM 630, to the approving official
  with a recommendation for either approval or disapproval.
     14.14.5.1. If approval is recommended, the endorsement reads: "Recommend approval.
     The information is correct to the best of my knowledge. Current leave balances have
     been verified with the NAF-HR. I understand I must verify each pay period whether the
     employee's medical emergency is continuing as far as I am able to determine. I will
     notify the AFSVA SSC to take the employee off paid leave status as soon as the
     employee returns to work, resigns, or is otherwise separated, or as soon as the medical
     emergency ends, whichever occurs first."
     14.14.5.2. If disapproval is recommended, the endorsement describes the reasons for the
     recommendation.
  14.14.6. Approving Official Action on Applications.
     14.14.6.1. The approving official notifies the leave recipient in writing within 5 working
     days whether or not the application is approved.
     14.14.6.2. If approved, a copy of the OPM 630, is provided to the supervisor, the NAF-
     HR, and the HQ AFSVA SSC. The OPM 630, serves as notification that the application
     is approved, authorizes the NAF-HR to proceed with appropriate publicity, and
     authorizes the payroll office NAF AO to coordinate with the paying office and to accept
     leave donations.
     14.14.6.3. If the application is disapproved, the approving official writes a memorandum
     to the employee explaining the reasons for disapproval. A copy of the memorandum is
     sent to the first-level supervisor. Disapproval is not a matter subject to NAF grievance or
     appeal procedures.
  14.14.7. NAF-HR Action on Applications. The NAF-HR issues publicity to solicit
  donations from eligible employees through appropriate publicity channels (informational
  bulletins, circulars, bulletin board notices, etc.) as determined locally. Publicity releases
  explain the nature of the medical emergency; e.g., "chemotherapy treatments which will
  completely incapacitate the employee for X length of time," but are not needlessly graphic,
  clinically detailed, or phrased in medical jargon not generally understood. Do not disclose
  medical information that the leave recipient has indicated he or she wants private.
  14.14.8. Donor's Action. Eligible employees volunteer to donate leave by submitting an
  OPM 630A, Request to Donate Annual Leave to Leave Recipient Under the Voluntary Leave
  Transfer Program, (Within Agency) request in writing to their first-level supervisor.
  14.14.9. Processing Leave Donation Requests.
     14.14.9.1. General.
         14.14.9.1.1. The maximum leave donation is limited to no more than one-half of the
         total amount of annual leave the donor is entitled to accrue during the leave year in
160                                                   AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


          which the donation is made; e.g., an employee who earns 110 hours of annual leave
          may donate a maximum of 55 hours.
          14.14.9.1.2. Leave is transferred on an hour for hour basis in whole hours only. The
          VLTP leave recipient is credited with the full amount of leave hours donated, even in
          those cases where the VLTP leave donor has a different basic rate of pay.
          14.14.9.1.3. Leave, once transferred, becomes available to the leave recipient for
          retroactive credit to periods of LWOP, and to liquidate an indebtedness for advanced
          leave granted as a result of the medical emergency, and for usage in the same manner
          as if it had been accrued by the individual. Leave recipients accrue sick and annual
          leave for all time covered by donated leave at the same rate as for normal leave
          accrual.
          14.14.9.1.4. The establishment of a pool or bank of transferred annual leave is not
          authorized except in situations of natural disasters per paragraph 14.15.
          14.14.9.1.5. If the employee's medical emergency terminates, the amount of unused
          leave previously credited remains in the recipient's leave account. However, no
          further donation of leave is credited beyond the termination date of the emergency.
      14.14.9.2. Procedures:
          14.14.9.2.1. The supervisor verifies accuracy and completeness of leave donation
          requests and forwards them to the NAF-HR.
          14.14.9.2.2. The NAF-HR verifies employment information in the requests and
          forwards them to the NAF AO.
          14.14.9.2.3. The NAF-HR validates leave balances, ensures compliance with the
          policies in paragraph 14.14.9.1, and forwards to the NAF AO who coordinates with
          the paying office.
   14.14.10. Termination of the Medical Emergency. Once a medical emergency is
   recognized, it is important to monitor the status of the emergency to ensure the leave
   recipient continues to be affected by the emergency. The first-line supervisor is usually the
   primary link in accomplishing this evaluation.
      14.14.10.1. When the supervisor learns from the leave recipient, a representative, or
      through other means, that the medical emergency is over, or no longer requires the
      absence from work of the leave recipient, the supervisor immediately writes a
      memorandum to the NAF AO, with copies to the recipient, the approving official, and the
      NAF-HR. The memorandum includes:
          14.14.10.1.1. The name and organization of the leave recipient.
          14.14.10.1.2. A statement that the medical emergency is terminated and the exact
          date of the termination. If there are unusual circumstances surrounding the
          termination of the medical emergency, these are described, e.g., if the employee is
          medically able to work but wishes to remain absent for an additional period of time
          for other reasons, etc.
          14.14.10.1.3. The date and time he or she returned if the employee has returned to
          work.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                161


          14.14.10.1.4. The supervisor's signature and date.
      14.14.10.2. The medical emergency affecting a leave recipient terminates when the leave
      recipient's employment is terminated or when the leave recipient is no longer affected by
      a medical emergency.
      14.14.10.3. The NAF-HR discontinues soliciting leave donations and notifies donors and
      potential donors that the emergency is over, using the same publicity avenues used to
      attract donors. Donations already in process are continued if a negative leave balance
      remains in the leave recipient's account.
      14.14.10.4. The NAF AO takes the employee off paid leave status and places the
      employee in the appropriate status, i.e., duty, LWOP, etc. Excess donated leave is used
      to offset shortfalls in prior pay periods due to absences not covered by leave caused by
      the same medical emergency. If donated leave remains, the NAF AO restores annual
      leave on a prorated basis to the donors, and notifies each donor of the amount of annual
      leave restored.
14.15. VLTP for employees affected by Natural Disasters.
   14.15.1. The office of primary responsibility is the NAF-HR; the NAF AO has financial
   oversight.
   14.15.2. These procedures apply to regular category NAF employees only. NAF employees
   are allowed to make annual leave donations to NAF employees at any base in the Air Force.
   14.15.3. Once an emergency or disaster has been declared by the President, the NAF-HR
   works with the FSS commander or director to (a) determine whether, and how much, donated
   annual leave is needed by affected employees; (b) approve leave donors and leave recipients;
   (c) facilitate the distribution of donated annual leave from approved leave donors to approved
   leave recipients, and work with their resource management organizations and the Air Force
   Services Agency to establish a leave bank.
   14.15.4. Processing Leave Donation Requests.
   14.15.4.1. The NAF-HR will provide applications to employees requesting leave donations
   as well as to those employees interested in donating leave. If desired, donating employees
   may designate a specific employee to receive their leave.
      14.15.4.2. Following completion, employees will submit their applications to the NAF-
      HR to verify leave balances and program eligibility.
      14.15.4.3. After review, the NAF-HR will notify HQ AFSVA SSC of leave requirements
      and/or donations and provide a copy of the approval documents.
      14.15.4.4. The HQ AFSVA SSC will notify base-level NAF AO of the availability of
      donated leave by pay period.
      14.15.4.5. The HQ AFSVA SSC will maintain records of all leave donations by
      employee name and employing NAFI as well as records of the employees receiving the
      donated leave, name of the person receiving the donated leave, and number of hours
      received.
162                                                     AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      14.15.4.6. When donated leave is used, the number of donated hours will be reduced at
      the losing base. Donated hours received will be added to the annual leave of the gaining
      base.
          14.15.4.6.1. The paying office will decrease hours at losing base and increase hours
          at the gaining base per employee with a clear audit trail of all transactions.
14.16. Family and Medical Leave Program.
   14.16.1. Background. The FMLA was enacted into law on 5 Feb 93 with an effective date
   of 5 Aug 93.
   14.16.2. Purpose. The FMLA established a family and medical leave program for Federal
   employees. An employee is entitled, during a twelve-month period, to a total of twelve
   weeks of unpaid family and medical leave, with employment and benefit protection, for one
   or more of the following reasons: (a) the birth of a son or daughter of the employee and the
   care of such son or daughter; (b) the placement of a son or daughter with the employee for
   adoption or foster care; (c) the care of a spouse, son, daughter, or parent of the employee if
   such spouse, son, daughter, or parent has a serious health condition; or (d) a serious health
   condition of the employee that makes the employee unable to perform any one or more of the
   essential functions of his or her position. Family leave covers the situations described in (a),
   (b), and (c), above; medical leave covers the situation described in (d), above. The National
   Defense Authorization Act for FY 2008 (NDAA), Public Law 110-181, amended the FMLA
   to allow eligible employees to use their 12 weeks of job-protected leave in the applicable 12-
   month period for any ―qualifying exigency‖ arising out of the active duty or call to active
   duty status of a spouse, son, daughter or parent. The NDAA also amended the FMLA to
   allow eligible employees to take up to 26 weeks of job-protected leave in a ―single 12-month
   period‖ to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness.
      14.16.2.1. The ―single 12-month period‖ for leave to care for a covered service member
      with a serious injury or illness begins on the first day the employee takes leave for this
      reason and ends 12 months later, regardless of the 12 month period established for other
      types of FMLA leave.
      14.16.2.2. An eligible employee is limited to a combined total of 26 workweeks of leave
      for any FMLA-qualifying reason during the ―single 12-month period.‖ (Only 12 of the
      26 weeks total may be for a FMLA-qualifying reason other than to care for a covered
      service member.)
   14.16.3. Notification Requirement. A notice describing the FMLA's provisions is posted in
   a prominent place in the worksite. The notice is at least 8½ inches by 11 inches, and is fully
   legible. Figure 14.1 is used as the basis for the required notice to employees.
   14.16.4. Coverage. The FMLA applies to all NAF employees, regular and flexible, who are
   otherwise eligible under these provisions.
   14.16.5. Service Requirement. To be eligible to take family or medical leave, an employee
   must complete at least 12 months of service as an employee, excluding military service
   (other than military duty performed while in a civilian position.) The 12 months of service

AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               163


  year or less are subject to the provisions of Title I of the FMLA. Title I is regulated by the
  Department of Labor.
  14.16.6. Type of Leave.
     14.16.6.1. Family and medical leave is in addition to annual leave, sick leave, advanced
     annual or sick leave, other LWOP, leave made available under the VLTP, and
     compensatory time off available to the employee. It is an entitlement that provides an
     employee up to 26 workweeks of unpaid leave in a 12-month period for certain family
     and medical needs and covered service members. A father and a mother are each entitled
     to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave for a birth, adoption, placement, or for the care of a son
     or daughter with a serious health condition.
     14.16.6.2. Family or medical leave is not subtracted from the employee's entitlement
     unless the employee confirms for management that he or she is invoking the entitlement
     to such leave. Once invoked, the 12-month period begins on the date an employee first
     takes leave for a family or medical need and continues for 12 months.
     14.16.6.3. In cases involving the birth or placement of a child, family leave must be
     concluded within 12 months after the date of birth or placement. Such leave may begin
     prior to or on the actual date of birth or placement.
     14.16.6.4. The 26-workweek period is the maximum period of leave an employee is
     entitled to for both family and medical leave during the 12-month period. To the extent
     that an employee has previously taken family leave, the employee's entitlement to
     medical leave may be less than 26 workweeks and vice versa.
     14.16.6.5. Family and medical leave is available to all employees. A total of 26
     workweeks is available in direct proportion to the number of hours in the employee's
     regularly scheduled workweek. The leave entitlement is calculated on an hourly basis to
     equal twelve times the average number of hours in the employee's regularly scheduled
     workweek. If the number of hours in an employee's workweek varies from week to
     week, a weekly average of the hours scheduled over the twelve workweeks prior to the
     date leave commences is used as the basis for the calculation.
     14.16.6.6. If the number of hours in an employee's workweek is changed during the 12-
     month period of family or medical leave, entitlement to any remaining family and
     medical leave is recalculated based on the number of hours in the employee's current
     workweek.
  14.16.7. How to Remain in a Pay Status When Invoking Family or Medical Leave:
     14.16.7.1. An employee may elect to substitute accumulated annual or sick leave;
     advanced annual or sick leave; or, leave made available under the VLTP; for any or all of
     the family or medical leave needed. An employee may not substitute sick leave in any
     situation in which sick leave would not normally be provided under current law and
     regulation. An employee who substitutes paid time off for the unpaid leave is, for benefit
     purposes, treated as an employee in pay status versus LWOP.
     14.16.7.2. The election to substitute paid leave for LWOP is made prior to the date paid
     leave commences. An employee may not retroactively substitute paid leave for LWOP
     previously taken under this program. Management may not deny an employee's right to
164                                                       AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


         substitute paid leave for any or all of the period of LWOP for family or medical leave
         taken. Nor may management require an employee to substitute paid leave for any or all
         of the period of LWOP for family or medical leave taken.
   14.16.8. Intermittent Leave or Reduced Leave Schedule:
         14.16.8.1. Intermittent leave or leave taken intermittently means leave taken in separate
         blocks of time, rather than for one continuous period of time, and may include leave
         periods of 15 minutes to several weeks.
         14.16.8.2. An employee may choose to take medical leave, or family leave to provide
         care for a family member, on an intermittent basis or in the form of a reduced
         workday/workweek (referred to as a reduced leave schedule) when medically necessary,
         and when agreed to by management. If the leave taken under these conditions is
         foreseeable based on planned medical treatment or recovery from a serious health
         condition, management may place the employee, temporarily, in an available alternative
         position for which the employee is qualified and that can better accommodate the
         recurring periods of leave.
         14.16.8.3. An alternative position need not consist of equivalent duties, but must be in
         the same commuting area; provide an equivalent grade or pay level; the same type of
         appointment, work schedule, and the same employment benefits available in the
         employee's previous position. Pay level includes any applicable interim geographic
         adjustment, special rate of pay, locality-based comparability payment, or special salary
         rate. Upon termination of the circumstances that required the medical or family leave,
         the employee is returned to his or her permanent position or an equivalent position
         addressed later in this guidance.
         14.16.8.4. An employee may not take leave on an intermittent basis or under a reduced
         leave schedule for the birth or placement of a child unless the employee and supervisor
         agree.
      14.16.9. General Definitions.
         14.16.9.1. Four terms used in the definition of "son or daughter" have been grouped
         together for ease of reference:
             14.16.9.1.1. Son or daughter means a biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild,
             a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is under 18 years of
             age or 18 years of age or older and incapable of self-care because of mental or
             physical disability. A son or daughter incapable of self-care requires active assistance
             or supervision to provide daily self-care in three or more of the ―activities of daily
             living‖ (ADLs) or ―instrumental activities of daily living‖ (IADLs). ADLs include
             adaptive activities such as caring appropriately for one’s grooming and hygiene,
             bathing, dressing, and eating. IADLs include cooking, cleaning, shopping, taking
             public transportation, paying bills, maintaining a residence, using telephones and
             directories, using a post office, etc.
                14.16.9.1.1.1. Adopted refers to a legal process in which an individual becomes
                the legal parent of another's child. The source of an adopted child--e.g. whether
                from a licensed placement agency or otherwise--is not a factor in determining
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   165


            eligibility for family leave.
            14.16.9.1.1.2. In Loco Parentis refers to the situation of an individual who has
            day-to-day responsibility for the care and financial support of a child or, in the
            case of an employee, who had such responsibility for the employee when the
            employee was a child. A biological or legal relationship is not necessary. For
            example, an employee who lives with, cares for, and acts as a parent to the
            employee's grandchild or an employee who is divorced from the parent with
            custody would be entitled to family leave should the child need care for a serious
            health condition.
            14.16.9.1.1.3. Incapable of self-care refers to the situation of a son or daughter
            who requires active assistance or supervision to provide daily self-care in several
            of the activities of daily living. Activities of daily living include adaptive
            activities such as caring appropriately for one's grooming and hygiene, bathing,
            dressing, eating, cooking, cleaning, shopping, taking public transportation, paying
            bills, maintaining a residence, using telephones and directories, and using a post
            office, etc.
            14.16.9.1.1.4. Mental or physical disability refers to a mental or physical
            impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an
            individual as defined in 29 CFR 1630.2(h), (i), and (j).
        14.16.9.1.2. Foster care means 24-hour care for children in substitution for, and away
        from, their parents or guardian. Such placement is made by or with the agreement of
        the state as a result of a voluntary agreement by the parent or guardian that the child
        be removed from the home, or pursuant to a judicial determination of the necessity
        for foster care, and involves agreement between the state and foster family to take the
        child. Although foster care may be with relatives of the child, state action is involved
        in the removal of the child from parental custody.
        14.16.9.1.3. Parent means a biological parent or an individual who stands or stood in
        loco parentis to an employee when the employee was a son or daughter. The term
        does not include parents ―in law.‖
        14.16.9.1.4. Spouse means an individual who is a husband or wife pursuant to a
        marriage that is a legal union between one man and one woman, including common
        law marriage between one man or one woman in states where it is recognized.
        14.16.9.1.5. Military Caregiver means a spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin
        of a covered service member with a serious injury or illness. A serious injury or
        illness is one that was incurred by a service member in the line of duty on active duty
        that may render the service member medically unfit to perform the duties of his or her
        office, grade, rank, or rating.
     14.16.9.1.6. Covered service member means (1) a member of the Armed Forces,
     including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical
     treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on
     the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness; or (2) a veteran who is
     undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, for a serious injury or illness and
     who was a member of the Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or
166                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      Reserves) at any time during the period of 5 years preceding the date on which the
      veteran undergoes that medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy.
         14.16.9.1.7. A serious injury or illness means (1) one that was incurred by a service
         member in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces (or existed before the
         beginning of the member’s active duty and was aggravated by service in line of duty
         on active duty in the Armed Forces) and that may render the member medically unfit
         to perform the duties of the member’s office, grade, rank, or rating or (2) in the case
         of a veteran who was a member of the Armed Forces (including a member of the
         National Guard or Reserves) at any time during a period described in paragraph
         14.16.9.1.6 , means a qualifying (as defined by the Secretary of Labor) injury or
         illness that was incurred by the member in line of duty on active duty in the Armed
         Forces (or existed before the beginning of the member’s active duty and was
         aggravated by service in line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces) and that
         manifested itself before or after the member became a veteran.
         14.16.9.1.8. Qualifying exigencies include:
            14.16.9.1.8.1. Issues arising from a covered military member’s short notice
            deployment (i.e., deployment on seven or less days of notice) for a period of
            seven days from the date of notification;
            14.16.9.1.8.2. Military events and related activities, such as official ceremonies,
            programs, or events sponsored by the military or family support or assistance
            programs and informational briefings sponsored or promoted by the military,
            military service organizations, or the American Red Cross that are related to the
            active duty or call to active duty status of a covered military member;
            14.16.9.1.8.3. Certain childcare and related activities arising from the active duty
            or call to active duty status of a covered military member, such as arranging for
            alternative childcare, providing childcare on a non-routine, urgent, immediate
            need basis, enrolling or transferring a child in a new school or a day care facility
            if they are necessary due to circumstances arising from the active duty or call to
            active duty of the covered military member;
            14.16.9.1.8.4. Making or updating financial and legal arrangements to address a
            covered military member’s absence;
            14.16.9.1.8.5. Attending counseling provided by someone other than a health
            care provider for oneself, the covered military member, or the child of the covered
            military member, the need for which arises from the active duty or call to active
            duty status of the covered military member;
            14.16.9.1.8.6. Taking up to five days of leave to spend time with a covered
            military member who is on short-term temporary, rest and recuperation leave
            during deployment;
            14.16.9.1.8.7. Attending to certain post-deployment activities, including
            attending arrival ceremonies, reintegration briefings and events, and other official
            ceremonies or programs sponsored by the military for a period of 90 days
            following the termination of the covered military member’s active duty status, and
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 167


             addressing issues arising from the death of a covered military member;
             14.16.9.1.8.8. Any other event that the employee and supervisor agree is a
             qualifying exigency.
  14.16.10. Employee Notice to Management. If the need for leave is foreseeable, the
  employee is required to provide 30 calendar days notice to the supervisor before the leave is
  to begin. If events beyond the control of the employee require an employee to begin family
  or medical leave before the full 30-day notice can be provided, the employee remains
  responsible for providing as much notice as is practical. This notice suffices as the
  employee's notification of intent to invoke his or her entitlement to family or medical leave.
  If necessary, notice may be given by an employee's personal representative (e.g., a family
  member or other responsible party.)
     14.16.10.1. If an employee's need for leave under paragraph 14.16.2. (c) or (d) is
     foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, the employee consults with management
     and makes a reasonable effort to schedule medical treatment so as not to unduly disrupt
     the operations of the employer, subject to the approval of the health care provider.
     Management may, for justifiable cause request that an employee reschedule medical
     treatment, subject to the approval of the health care provider.
     14.16.10.2. If an employee's need for leave is foreseeable, and the employee fails to give
     30 days notice with no reasonable excuse for the failure, management may delay the
     taking of leave until at least 30 days after the date the employee provides the required
     notice.
     14.16.10.3. When an employee invokes family or medical leave, management provides
     guidance concerning the employee's rights and obligations under this program.
  14.16.11. Defining a Serious Health Condition. An employee may take family leave in
  order to care for a spouse, son or daughter, or parent with a serious health condition or
  medical leave because of the employee's own serious health condition that makes the
  employee unable to perform the functions of his or her position. In defining a serious health
  condition the terms continuing treatment, health care provider and unable to perform the
  essential functions are used. Definitions of all terms are:
     14.16.11.1. Serious health condition means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or
     mental condition that involves:
     14.16.11.1.1. Inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital, hospice, or residential
     medical care facility, including any period of incapacity or any subsequent treatment in
     connection with such inpatient care; or
         14.16.11.1.2. Continuing treatment by a health care provider that includes (but is not
         limited to) examinations to determine if there is a serious health condition and
         evaluations of such conditions if the examinations or evaluations determine that a
         serious health condition exists. Continuing treatment by a health care provider may
         include one or more of the following:
             14.16.11.1.2.1. A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar
             days, including any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the
             same condition, which also involves:
168                                                AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


             14.16.11.1.2.1.1. Treatment two or more times by a health care provider, by a
             health care provider under the direct supervision of the affected individual’s
             health care provider, or by a provider of health care services under orders of,
             or on referral by, a health care provider; or
             14.16.11.1.2.1.2. Treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion
             which results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of
             the health care provider (e.g., a course of prescription medication or therapy
             requiring special equipment to resolve or alleviate the health condition).
         14.16.11.1.2.2. Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care,
         even if the affected individual does not receive active treatment from a health care
         provider during the period in incapacity or the period of incapacity does not last
         more than three consecutive calendar days.
         14.16.11.1.2.3. Any period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity due to a
         chronic serious health condition that:
             14.16.11.1.2.3.1. Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care
             provider or by a health care provider under the direct supervision of the
             affected individual’s health care provider;
             14.16.11.1.2.3.2. Continues over an extended period of time (including
             recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and
             14.16.11.1.2.3.3. May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of
             incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.). The condition is covered
             even if the affected individual does not receive active treatment from a health
             care provider during the period of incapacity or the period of incapacity does
             not last more than three consecutive calendar days.
         14.16.11.1.2.4. A period of incapacity, which is permanent or long-term due to a
         condition for which treatment may not be effective. The affected individual must
         be under the continuing supervision of, but need not be receiving active treatment
         by, a health care provider (e.g., Alzheimer’s, severe stroke, or terminal stages of a
         disease).
         14.16.11.1.2.5. Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments (including
         any period of recovery) by a health care provider or by a provider of health care
         services under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either for
         restorative surgery after an accident or other injury or for a condition that would
         likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar
         days in the absence of medical intervention or treatment (e.g.,
         chemotherapy/radiation for cancer, physical therapy for severe arthritis, dialysis
         for kidney disease).
      14.16.11.1.3. Serious health condition does not include routine physical, eye, or
      dental examinations; a regimen of continuing treatment that includes the taking of
      over-the-counter medications, bed-rest, exercise, and other similar activities that can
      be initiated without a visit to the health care provider; a condition for which cosmetic
      treatments are administered, unless inpatient hospital care is required or unless
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              169


        complications develop; or an absence because of an employee’s use of an illegal
        substance, unless the employee is receiving treatment for substance abuse by a health
        care provider or by a provider of health care services on referral by a health care
        provider. Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common cold, the flu, earaches,
        upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches (other than migraines), routine dental or
        orthodontia problems, and periodontal disease are not serious health conditions.
        Allergies, restorative dental or plastic surgery after an injury, removal of cancerous
        growth, or mental illness resulting from stress may be serious health conditions only
        if such conditions require inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health care
        provider.
     14.16.11.2. Health care provider means:
        14.16.11.2.1. A licensed Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy or a physician
        who is serving on active duty in the uniformed services and is designated by the
        uniformed service to conduct examinations;
        14.16.11.2.2. Any health care provider recognized by the Federal Employees Health
        Benefits Program or who is licensed or certified under Federal or State law to provide
        the service in question;
        14.16.11.2.3. A health care provider as defined in paragraph 14.16.11.2.2. who
        practices in a country other than the U.S., who is authorized to practice in accordance
        with the laws of that country, and who is performing within the scope of his or her
        practice as defined under such law;
        14.16.11.2.4. A Christian Science practitioner listed with the First Church of Christ,
        Scientist, in Boston, Massachusetts; or
        14.16.11.2.5. A Native American, including an Eskimo, Aleut, and Native Hawaiian,
        who is recognized as a traditional healing practitioner by native traditional religious
        leaders and who practices traditional healing methods as believed, expressed, and
        exercised in Indian religions of the American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, and Native
        Hawaiians, consistent with Public Law 95-314, August 11, 1978 (92 Stat. 469), as
        amended by Public Law 103-344, October 6, 1994 (108 Stat. 3125).
     14.16.11.3. Incapacity means the inability to work, attend school, or perform other
     regular daily activities because of a serious health condition or treatment for a recovery
     from a serious health condition.
     14.16.11.4. Unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position means the
     fundamental job duties of the employee's position. It is not necessary that an employee
     literally be so physically or mentally incapacitated that he or she is unable to work in
     order to meet the requirement of being unable to perform the essential functions of his or
     her position. An employee who must be away from work to receive medical treatment or
     for continuing medical supervision meets this requirement. For example, an employee
     undergoing kidney dialysis must be away from work to receive dialysis treatment, a
     cancer patient may require chemotherapy treatments, an individual who has suffered a
     serious car accident may require periodic physical therapy under medical supervision.
170                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


                NOTE: The following examples of a serious health condition were cited
                in the legislative history: heart attacks, heart conditions requiring heart
                bypass or valve operations, most cancers, back conditions requiring
                extensive therapy or surgical procedures, strokes, severe respiratory
                conditions, spinal injuries, appendicitis, pneumonia, emphysema, severe
                arthritis, severe nervous disorders, injuries caused by serious accidents,
                pregnancy, complications or illnesses related to pregnancy (such as
                severe morning sickness), the need for prenatal care, childbirth and
                recovery from childbirth.
           14.16.11.4.1. Conditions or medical procedures that would not normally be covered
           by the Act include minor illnesses that last only a few days and surgical procedures
           that typically do not involve hospitalization and require only a brief recovery period.
           (Complications arising out of such procedures that develop into serious health
           conditions are covered.) Voluntary or cosmetic treatments (such as most treatments
           for orthodontia or acne) that are not medically necessary are not covered, unless
           overnight inpatient hospital care is required. Restorative dental surgery after an
           accident or removal of cancerous growths are included if the other conditions are met,
           e.g., the condition requires an absence of more than three days. Treatments for
           allergies and stress are also included if the other conditions are met. Routine physical
           examinations are excluded.
           14.16.11.4.2. Treatment of substance abuse is also included, such as when a stay in
           an inpatient treatment facility is required. On the other hand, absence because of the
           employee's use of the substance, without treatment, does not qualify for leave under
           the FMLA.
   14.16.12. Medical Certification.
       14.16.12.1. Management may require written medical certification issued by the health
       care provider of the employee or the health care provider of the spouse, son, daughter, or
       parent of the employee, as appropriate. The employee must provide the certification in a
       timely manner. The employee pays the expense for and selects the health care provider
       to provide the original certification. Medical certification includes:
           14.16.12.1.1. The date on which the serious health condition commenced.
           14.16.12.1.2. The probable duration of the serious health condition or specify that the
           serious health condition is a chronic or continuing condition with an unknown
           duration and whether the patient is presently incapacitated and the likely duration and
           frequency of episodes of incapacity.
           14.16.12.1.3. The appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care
           provider regarding the serious health condition, including a general statement as to
           the incapacitation, examination, or treatment that is required by a health care
           provider.
14.16.12.1.4. If applicable, a statement from the health care provider that the son, daughter,
spouse or parent of the employee requires psychological comfort and/or physical care; needs
assistance for basic medical, hygienic, nutritional, safety, or transportation needs or in making
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   171


arrangements to meet such needs (e.g., care by a visiting nurse, placement in a special school);
and would benefit from the employee's care or presence.
           14.16.12.1.5. If applicable, a statement from the employee on the care he or she will
           provide and an estimate of the amount of time needed to care for his or her spouse,
           son, daughter, or parent.
           14.16.12.1.6. If applicable, a statement that the employee is unable to perform one or
           more of the essential functions of his or her position or requires medical treatment for
           a serious health condition, based on written information provided by management on
           the essential functions of the employee's position (e.g., such as a copy of the
           employee's PD and/or performance standards) or, if not provided, discussion with the
           employee about the essential functions of his or her position.
           14.16.12.1.7. If applicable, the dates on which planned medical treatment is expected
           to be given and the duration of such treatment (required to certify the need for
           intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule.)
       14.16.12.2. The information on the medical certification shall relate only to the serious
       health condition for which the current need for family and medical leave exists.
       Management may not require any personal or confidential information in the written
       medical certification other than that required by paragraph 14.16.12.1. If an employee
       submits a completed medical certification signed by a health care provider, management
       may not request new information from the health care provider. However, a health care
       provider representing the AF, including a health care provider employed by the Air Force
       or under administrative oversight of the AF, may contact the health care provider who
       completed the medical certification, with the employee’s permission, for purposes of
       clarifying the medical certification.
       14.16.12.3. In situations where an employee is unable to provide requested medical
       certification before leave begins, management grants the leave on a provisional basis
       (provisional leave). If ultimately, the employee fails to provide the required certification,
       management may allow the employee to have the provisional leave charged to LWOP,
       the employee's annual and/or sick leave account, as appropriate, or may charge the
       employee as AWOL. Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against an employee
       who knowingly provides false medical certification of the need for leave.
       14.16.12.4. To remain entitled to leave to care for a family member or for the employee's
       own illness, the employee or the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent must
       comply with any requirement from management that he or she submit to examination
       (though not treatment) to obtain a second or third medical certification from a health care
       provider other than the individual's health care provider. If the individual refuses to
       submit to such examination and the employee fails to provide medical certification, the
       employee may be denied family or medical leave.
       14.16.12.5. When there is reason to doubt the validity of the medical certification,
       management may require, at the expense of the installation, the employee obtain the
       opinion of a second health care provider designated or approved by management,
       concerning the information in the original certification. This health care provider cannot
       be employed by the DoD or be under its administrative oversight on a regular basis
172                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      unless access to health care is extremely limited--e.g., a rural area or an overseas location
      where no more than one or two health care providers practice in the relevant specialty, or
      the only health care providers available are employed by the DoD.
      14.16.12.6. In cases where the second opinion differs from the original certification,
      management may require, at the expense of the installation, that the employee obtain the
      opinion of a third health care provider designated or approved jointly by management and
      the employee, concerning the information in the original certification. Management and
      the employee must act in good faith to reach agreement on the third health care provider.
      The opinion of the third health care provider regarding the need for leave is binding upon
      management and the employee.
      14.16.12.7. Management may require, at the installation's expense, subsequent medical
      recertification from the health care provider on a periodic basis, not more often than
      every thirty calendar days. Management may require subsequent medical recertification
      more frequently if the employee requests that the original leave period be extended, the
      circumstances described in the original medical certification have changed significantly,
      or the agency receives information that casts doubt upon the continuing validity of the
      medical certification.
   14.16.13. Health Insurance. Health insurance continues during periods of family and
   medical leave for an employee enrolled in the health insurance program. During periods of
   unpaid family or medical leave, an employee is treated in the same manner as any other
   employee who continues coverage while on LWOP.
   14.16.14. Unemployment Compensation. An employee who is on unpaid family or
   medical leave is ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits since the employee is
   considered employed and not available for work.
  14.16.15. Greater Leave Entitlements. Management complies with any collective
  bargaining agreement or any employment benefit program or plan that provides greater
  family or medical leave entitlements to employees than those provided under this guidance.
  Conversely, the entitlements established for employees under this guidance may not be
  diminished by any collective bargaining agreement or any employment benefit program or
  plan.
  14.16.16. Records and Reports.
      14.16.16.1. Medical certifications are subject to the provisions of 5 CFR 293, subpart A,
      for safeguarding information.
      14.16.16.2. Reports on the use of family and medical leave are required. At a minimum,
      the following information concerning each employee who takes family or medical leave
      is maintained:
          14.16.16.2.1. The employee's rate of basic pay.
          14.16.16.2.2. The occupational series of the employee's position.
          14.16.16.2.3. The total number of hours of unpaid family and medical leave taken
          (including any paid leave substituted for LWOP for family or medical leave).
          14.16.16.2.4. Of the total hours, the number taken for family leave.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               173


        14.16.16.2.5. Of the total hours, the number taken for medical leave.
     14.16.16.3. When an employee transfers, the losing organization supplies the gaining
     organization with information on family and medical leave taken during the 12 months
     prior to the transfer. Specifically, the beginning and ending dates of the employee's 12-
     month period, and the number of unpaid family and medical leave hours taken during the
     employee's 12-month period.
  14.16.17. Prohibition of Coercion.
     14.16.17.1. Any interference with an employee's right to take family or medical leave is
     prohibited. Accordingly, no employee may directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten or
     coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten or coerce any other employee for the purpose of
     interfering with the employee's right to family and medical leave. This includes
     promising to confer or conferring any benefit (such as appointment, promotion or
     compensation), or taking or threatening to take any reprisal (such as deprivation of
     appointment, promotion or compensation).
     14.16.17.2. This prohibition does not preclude discussions on scheduling leave in a
     manner that assists the supervisor in planning for the performance of work during the
     employee's absence. Nor does it prohibit the requirement for medical certification,
     recertification, or subsequent opinions.
  14.16.18. Enforcement. Employees who believe management has not fully complied with
  the FMLA or this guidance may file a grievance under the administrative grievance
  procedures or negotiated grievance procedures, as appropriate.
  14.16.19. Returning From Family or Medical Leave.
     14.16.19.1. An employee who takes family or medical leave is entitled to return to the
     position held immediately before taking family or medical leave.
     14.16.19.2. On rare occasions, when returning an employee to the same position imposes
     extreme hardship, management has the flexibility to place the employee in an equivalent
     position with equivalent benefits, pay, status, and other terms and conditions of
     employment.
     14.16.19.3. An equivalent position is in the same commuting area and carries or provides
     at a minimum: (a) the same or substantially similar duties and responsibilities which
     must entail substantially equivalent skill, effort, responsibility and authority; (b) an
     equivalent grade or pay level including any applicable interim geographic adjustment,
     special rate of pay; any locality-based comparability payments; or any special salary rate;
     (c) the same type of appointment and work schedule; (d) the same employment benefits
     made available to the employee in his or her previous position; (e) opportunity for WGIs,
     incentive and performance awards; (f) the same or equivalent premium pay consistent
     with applicable law and regulation; and (g) the same or equivalent opportunity for
     training or education benefits consistent with applicable law and regulation, including
     any training that an employee is required to complete to qualify for his or her previous
     position.
     14.16.19.4. Management may not return an employee to an equivalent position where
     written notification has been provided that the equivalent position will be affected by a
174                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      business based action if the employee's previous position is not affected by a business
      based action.
      14.16.19.5. Upon the employee's return to work, employment benefits (e.g., health
      insurance, life insurance) are provided at the same level to which the employee would
      have been entitled had the employee not taken family or medical leave. Basically, the
      employee's benefits are treated the same way as those of any other employee returning
      from a LWOP status.
      14.16.19.6. Conversely, an employee has no greater rights to restoration or benefits than
      the employee would have had if the employee had not taken family or medical leave. For
      example, if there had been a business-based action or transfer of function, the employee
      would not be entitled to be treated any differently than he or she would have been had the
      employee not been on family or medical leave.
      14.16.19.7. As a condition of returning, management may establish a uniformly applied
      practice or policy that requires all similarly-situated employees, (i.e., same occupation,
      same serious health condition) to obtain written medical certification from a health care
      provider of the employee that the employee is able to perform the essential functions of
      his or her position. This condition applies only to those employees who take medical
      leave (an employee's own serious health condition). When this condition of returning is
      applied, management notifies the employee of the requirement before leave commences
      and pays the expenses for obtaining the written medical certification. An employee’s
      refusal or failure to provide written medical certification may be grounds for appropriate
      disciplinary action.
   14.16.20. Interaction with Other Laws. The family and medical leave entitlement does not
   modify or affect any federal law prohibiting discrimination. If the entitlements under the
   Family and Medical Leave Program conflict with any federal law prohibiting discrimination,
   management must comply with whichever statute provides greater entitlement to employees.
   For example, if because of an illness or injury, a regular employee cannot perform the
   essential functions of his or her position, the FMLA entitles an employee to take leave either
   on an intermittent or continuous basis and to retain the regular position of record. This
   entitlement continues until the 12 workweeks of leave are exhausted. At the end of the
   FMLA entitlement, an employee is entitled to be returned to his or her same position or
   placed in an equivalent position with pay and benefits equivalent to those held by the
   employee when leave commenced--i.e., those of a regular position. If the employee is unable
   to perform the essential duties of the previous position, the Rehabilitation Act may,
   depending on the nature of the employee's disability, require an agency to attempt
   accommodation. If, for example, the effort to accommodate results in the employee being
   placed in a flexible position, the employee would be entitled only to those benefits provided
   to flexible employees.
14.17. Family Friendly Leave Act (FFLA)
   14.17.1. FFLA, P.L. 103-388, enacted into law on 22 Oct 94. This authority is
   administratively extended to NAF employees. The FFLA expands the use of sick leave for
   certain NAF employees. These employees may now use sick leave for the following two
   reasons:
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 175


     14.17.1.1. Family care. To give care or otherwise attend to a family member having an
     illness, injury, or other condition which, if the employee had such a condition, would
     justify the use of sick leave by such an employee.
     14.17.1.2. Bereavement. For purposes relating to the death of a family member,
     including to make arrangements for or attend the funeral of such family member.
         14.17.1.2.1. The term ―family member‖ means spouse and parents thereof; children,
         including adopted children, and spouses thereof; parents; brothers and sisters, and
         spouses thereof; an individual related by blood or affinity whose close association
         with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship.
         14.17.1.2.2. The term ―children, including adopted children, and spouses thereof,‖ as
         used covers adult sons and daughters, and spouses thereof, whether disabled or not.
         14.17.1.2.3. The term ―illness, injury or other condition‖ includes physical or mental
         illness; pregnancy and childbirth; medical, dental or optical examination or treatment.
  14.17.2. Limitation on Use of Sick Leave for Family Care or Bereavement. The FFLA
  authorizes the use of up to 40 hours of sick leave per leave year. There is no minimum
  balance of sick leave required to use the first 40 hours. In addition, an employee who
  maintains a minimum balance of at least 80 hours of sick leave may use up to an additional
  64 hours of sick leave per leave year, bring the total amount of sick leave available for family
  care and bereavement purposes to a maximum of 104 hours per leave year.
  14.17.3. Calculation of Sick Leave Hours for Family Care or Bereavement.
     14.17.3.1. For the employee who works 40 non-overtime hours per week consistently
     and regularly throughout the leave year, the number of sick leave hours that may be used
     for family care and bereavement are those authorized para 14.17.2.
     14.17.3.2. For all other employees, the basic amount of sick leave that may be used for
     family care and bereavement shall be equal to the average number of non-overtime hours
     of work in the employee’s scheduled workweek. To determine the employee’s average
     number of non-overtime hours in a workweek, a weekly average of the number of non-
     overtime hours scheduled over the twelve workweeks prior to the date leave commences
     is used as the basis for calculation. In addition, an employee who maintains a sick leave
     balance equal to at least twice the weekly average of non-overtime hours worked each
     week as computed above, may use an additional amount equal to the number of hours of
     sick leave normally accrued by the employee during a leave year minus the basic amount
     of sick leave authorized for FFLA. As the number of hours in the employee’s workweeks
     vary, entitlement to any remaining sick leave for FFLA must be recalculated for each
     subsequent request for sick leave throughout the leave year.
     Example of calculation. A regular employee, who works a different number of non-
     overtime hours each week, has requested sick leave for family care.

     Total non-overtime hours worked preceding 12 workweeks               395
     Average number of non-overtime weekly hours
            (395 divided by 12)                                             32
     Number of basic sick leave hours for FFLA authorized                   32
176                                                     AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


       Sick leave balance required to take any further
               sick leave for FFLA (32x2)                                    64
       Number of sick leave hours normally accrued during
               leave year (32 hrs x 52 weeks x 5%)                           83
       Number of additional sick leave hours for FFLA authorized
               (83 minus 32)                                                 51
       Total sick leave hours for FFLA                                       83
       14.17.3.3. Granting Sick Leave. Sick leave for family care and bereavement must be
       requested and approved in the same manner as sick leave for personal illness or medical
       care, and the same documentation requirements apply.
          14.17.3.4. The amount of sick leave granted to an employee described in 14.17.3.1,
          may not exceed a total of 104 hours per leave year. The amount of sick leave granted
          to an employee described in 14.17.3.2, may not exceed the number of hours of sick
          leave normally accrued by that employee during a leave year.
          14.17.3.4.1. To be granted any sick leave during any leave year in an amount
          exceeding 40 hours (for the employee described in 14.17.3.1), the employee
          concerned shall retain in his or her sick leave account a balance of at least 80 hours
          after deducting the amount requested that exceeds the basic 40 hours. For example, if
          an employee requests 104 hours of sick leave for family care, the employee must
          have a beginning sick leave balance of 184 hours.
          14.17.3.4.2. To be granted any sick leave during the leave year in an amount
          exceeding the average number of hours in the employee’s workweek (for the
          employee described in para 14.17.3.2), the employee concerned shall retain in his or
          her sick leave account a balance of at least twice the average number of hours in the
          employee’s average workweek. Using the example in para 14.17.3.2, if this
          employee requested all 83 hours of sick leave authorized, the employee must have a
          beginning sick leave balance of 147 hours.
       14.17.3.5. Interaction with VLTP. An employee who applies to become a leave recipient
       under the VLTP to care for a family member is required to use the sick leave available to
       him or her under the provisions of the FFLA before he or she is eligible to become a
       leave recipient of donated annual leave.
       14.17.3.6. Recordkeeping Requirements. All supervisors will be required to maintain
       information manually on employees who use sick leave for family care or bereavement.
       The NAF-HR will issue periodic reminders about the need to maintain the required
       information, including the need to transfer the information whenever another supervisor
       within the organization assumes leave-approving duties for an employee. When an
       employee resigns, or transfers to another installation, all sick leave hours used for family
       care and bereavement in the current leave year is submitted to the NAF-HR to record on
       the SF 1150, Record of Leave Data, and filed in the employee’s OPF.
14.18. Volunteer Activities. Presidential Memorandum dated April 22, 1998 directed the
Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies to review their work scheduling practices and be
flexible, when possible, to allow Federal employees to plan and take time off to do community
service as allowed by public business.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 177


  14.18.1. The Federal personnel system provides departments and agencies with considerable
  flexibility in scheduling hours of work and time off. Departments and agencies are
  encouraged to make appropriate use of this flexibility in responding to requests for changes
  in work schedules or time off to allow employees to engage in volunteer activities, while
  giving due consideration to the effect of the employee's absence or change in duty schedule
  on work operations and productivity.
  14.18.2. Flexible or compressed work schedules may be established for employees who wish
  to engage in volunteer activities during normal working hours. Employees represented by an
  exclusively recognized union may participate in a flexible or compressed work schedule
  "only to the extent expressly provided under a collective bargaining agreement between the
  agency and the exclusive representative." (See 5 U.S.C. 6130(a)(2).) To review the extent to
  which AWS programs have already been applied, departments and agencies should review
  their internal AWS policies and practices and collective bargaining agreements. To determine
  how additional AWS flexibilities may be implemented, departments and agencies may also
  consult subchapter II of chapter 61 of title 5, United States Code; regulations in 5 CFR part
  610, subpart D, Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules; and the Handbook on Alternative
  Work Schedules. Information is also available in the Labor-Management Relations Guidance
  Bulletin: Negotiating Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules.
  14.18.3. Scheduling Time Off from Work. Employees seeking to participate in volunteer
  activities during basic working hours may be granted annual leave, LWOP, compensatory
  time off, or, in very limited and unique circumstances, excused absence, as discussed below.
     14.18.3.1. When employees request annual leave to perform volunteer service,
     management should be as accommodating as possible in reviewing and approving such
     requests consistent with AF guidance and applicable collective bargaining agreements.
     14.18.3.2. At the discretion of the management, LWOP may be granted to employees
     who wish to engage in volunteer activities during normal working hours. As with annual
     leave, management is encouraged, whenever possible, to act favorably upon requests by
     employees for LWOP to perform volunteer services. However, LWOP is appropriate for
     extended periods only if the employee is expected to return to his or her job at the end of
     the LWOP.
     14.18.3.3. Management may approve requests from employees for compensatory time
     off in exchange for performing an equal amount of time in irregular or occasional
     overtime work. For employees under flexible work schedules, management may approve
     employee requests for compensatory time off for both regularly scheduled and irregular
     or occasional overtime work.
     14.18.3.4. Commanders/directors have discretion to excuse employees from their duties
     without loss of pay or charge to leave. It is advised that the granting of excused absence
     for volunteer activities should be limited to those situations in which the employee's
     absence, in management’s determination, is not specifically prohibited by law and
     satisfies one or more of the following criteria: (1) the absence is directly related to the
     department or agency's mission; (2) the absence is officially sponsored or sanctioned by
     the head of the department or agency; (3) the absence will clearly enhance the
     professional development or skills of the employee in his or her current position; or (4)
     the absence is brief and is determined to be in the interest of the agency. Ultimately, it is
178                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      the responsibility of each commander/director to balance support for employees'
      volunteer activities with the need to ensure that employees' work requirements are
      fulfilled and that agency operations are conducted efficiently and effectively. NAF-HRs
      should review their internal guidance on excused absence and applicable collective
      bargaining agreements.
   14.18.4. Labor Management Relations. Management is reminded that conditions of
   employment (such as work schedules) of bargaining unit employees may not be changed
   without notifying the exclusive representative and bargaining unit on the matter to the extent
   required and/or permitted by laws, regulations, and collective bargaining agreements.
   Moreover, bargaining unit employees may participate in flexible or compressed work
   schedules "only to the extent expressly provided under a collective bargaining agreement
   between the agency and the exclusive representative."
   14.18.5. Prohibition of Coercion. While managers, supervisors, and other agency officials
   may encourage employees to become more involved in volunteer activities, 5 U.S.C. 6132
   provides that employees may not be coerced for the purpose of interfering with their legal
   rights under flexible and compressed work schedules.
   14.18.6. Conflict of Interest and Hatch Act Restrictions. Departments, agencies, and
   employees are reminded that conflict of interest laws and related regulations governing
   outside employment for compensation also apply to Federal employees who engage in
   volunteer activities. Hatch Act restrictions apply to employees who are on duty, as well as to
   those on paid or unpaid leave.
   14.18.7. Use of Government Facilities and Equipment. Employees may not use Government
   facilities and equipment for other than authorized purposes. (See 5 CFR 2635.704.)
   Employees may consult their agency ethics officials or Office of General Counsel for
   information about what may be authorized by their agency or department.
  14.18.8. Liability for Work-Related Injuries. Commanders/directors need to be aware of
  liability issues related to employee participation in volunteer activities. The Department of
  Labor advises that, in most instances, employees who perform mission-related agency
  sponsored/sanctioned, or skills-enhancing volunteer activities while they are on excused
  absence are covered by 5 U.S.C. Chapter 81, Compensation for Work Injuries. Other kinds
  of absences would most likely not be covered.
  14.18.9. Awards for Volunteerism. Commanders/directors are encouraged to recognize their
  employees who volunteer their skills to help others. However, providing cash or paid time
  off undermines the volunteer spirit in which these individuals donate their personal time and
  efforts for the benefit of others. Nevertheless, granting appropriate citations and letters of
  appreciation, or small mementos such as a "You Make a Difference" pin or mug, would
  demonstrate the agency's pride in the various beneficial services its employees render to the
  community. In addition, commanders/directors can publicize employee volunteer activities
  in internal publications, such as newsletters, bulletins, and magazines. Commanders/directors
  should make the effort to acknowledge and say "Thank You" to those whose personal efforts
  make their communities a better place to live and work and who contribute something extra
  to the well-being of others.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 179


14.19. Record of Leave Data. The SF 1150 is completed whenever an employee leaves, for
any reason, a regular position. The NAF-HR completes SF 1150 when a regular employee
separates from NAF employment (i.e., a removal, separation, termination, resignation, retirement
or transfer out), as well as when a regular employee is changed to a flexible employment
category. The NAF-HR utilizes AFSFMS Reporting Tool to obtain information to complete SF
1150. Record the balance of sick leave and annual leave hours; any lump sum leave paid, and
the hourly rate at which it was paid; and record any family or medical leave taken in the past 12-
month period. The original copy of the SF 1150 is filed in the employee's OPF.

Figure 14.1. Notification Requirements

YOUR RIGHTS UNDER FMLA

FMLA requires covered employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to "eligible"
employees for certain family and medical reasons. Eligible employees with a spouse, son, daughter, or
parent on active duty or call to active duty status in the National Guard or Reserves in support of a
contingency operation may use their 12-week leave entitlement to address certain qualifying exigencies.
FMLA also includes a special leave entitlement that permits eligible employees to take up to 26 weeks of
leave to care for a covered service member during a single 12-month period. Employees are eligible if
they have worked for a covered employer for at least 12 months.

REASONS FOR TAKING LEAVE: Unpaid leave is granted for any of the following reasons:

•   for incapacity due to pregnancy, prenatal medical care or child birth;
•   to care for the employee's child after birth, or placement for adoption or foster care;
•   to care for the employee's spouse, son or daughter, or parent, who has a serious health condition; or
•   for a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the employee's job.

At the employee's or employer's option, certain kinds of paid leave may be substituted for unpaid leave.

ADVANCE NOTICE AND MEDICAL CERTIFICATION: The employee must provide advance
leave notice and medical certification. Taking of leave may be denied if requirements are not met.

•   The employee must provide 30 days advance notice when the leave is "foreseeable." When 30 days
    notice is not possible, the employee must provide notice as soon as practicable.
•   An employer may require medical certification to support a request for leave because of a serious
    health condition, and may require second or third opinions (at the employer's expense) and a fitness
    for duty report to return to work.

JOB BENEFITS AND PROTECTION:

•   For the duration of FMLA leave, the employer maintains the employee's health coverage under any
    "group health plan." The employee pays their portion of the insurance contribution while on FMLA
    leave.
•   Upon return from FMLA leave, employees are restored to their original or equivalent positions with
    equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms.
•   The use of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the
    start of an employee's leave.

UNLAWFUL ACTS BY EMPLOYERS: FMLA makes it unlawful for any employer to:

•   interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right provided under FMLA;
•   discharge or discriminate against any person for opposing any practice made unlawful by FMLA or
    for involvement in any proceeding under or relating to FMLA.

ENFORCEMENT:

•   An employee who believes management has not fully complied with the FMLA Act may file a
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                         181


    grievance under the administrative grievance procedures, or negotiated grievance procedures, as
    appropriate.

FMLA does not affect any Federal or State law prohibiting discrimination, or supersede any State or local
law or collective bargaining agreement which provides greater family or medical leave rights.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Contact the Human Resources Office.

                                           Chapter 15

                                   BENEFITS PROGRAMS

15.1. Coverage. This chapter covers the benefits programs provided eligible NAF employees
including the retirement, group life and health insurance, and flexible benefits plans. It also
provides basic information concerning other entitlements for NAF employees, including those
statutory entitlements in the Old Age, Survivor and Disability Insurance Program (social
security), the Hospital Insurance Program for Aged and Disabled Persons (Medicare), Workers'
Compensation Program, and the Federal Unemployment Compensation program. Details of the
contents, and procedural guidance for administering the AF sponsored programs in this chapter,
are outlined in AFI 34 series publications, and in other publications prepared and distributed by
HQ AFSVA/SVX. Employees may obtain detailed information pertaining to Social Security and
Medicare from their local Social Security Administration office.
15.2. AF NAF Employee Retirement Plan. There are two plans under which AF NAF
employees may accrue benefits to provide income after their retirement from active employment:
the Federal Social Security Program and the AF NAF Retirement Plan. The NAF Retirement
Plan is the sponsor for eligible AF NAF employees. Employing NAFIs contribute to this plan on
behalf of AF NAF employees. Generally, to be eligible to participate in the AF NAF Retirement
Plan, an employee must be a regular civilian employee (excluding ODM) and employed by an
AF NAFI in the U.S., or if employed outside the U.S., the employee must be a U.S. civilian
(citizen, permanent resident, or non-citizen national of the U.S.) paid on the U.S. dollar payroll.
The employee may enroll upon completion of twelve months of regular Air Force service. If the
employee enrolls within 30 days of the one year eligibility date, those twelve months are
included in credited service. The basic provisions for administering the plan, and for enrolling,
terminating, and retiring employees are in AFI 34-302, Air Force Nonappropriated Fund
Employee Retirement Plan.
   15.2.1. Joint Basing Provisions for Retirement.
       15.2.1.1. AF NAF Employees Transferring to Other NAF as Supporting Service. Under
       Joint Basing, AF NAF employees may elect to remain in the AF NAF retirement plan
       when they are moved to a Supporting NAF employer. The Supporting employer will
       deduct the appropriate AF NAF employee contribution and forward to the AF NAF
       retirement plan. The Supporting employer will also make the appropriate AF NAF
       employer contribution and forward to the AF NAF retirement plan. For employees who
       are participating in the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) or Civil Service
       Retirement Plan (CSRS) AF NAF will deduct the appropriate employee contributions,
       make employer contributions and forward to the appropriated fund (APF) system.
       15.2.1.2. NAF Employees Transferring to AF NAF as the Supporting Service. Under
       Joint Basing, eligible employees who become AF employees may elect to retain their
       Supported retirement plan. AF NAF will deduct the appropriate employee contributions
       and forward to the Supported employer. AF NAF will also make the appropriate
       employer contribution and forward to the Supported employer. For employees
       participating in the FERS or CSRS, the Supporting employer will deduct the appropriate
       employee contributions, make employer contributions and forward to the APF system.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                183


   15.2.2. 401(k) Savings Plan. This plan provides eligible employees with an employee and
   employer contributory retirement savings plan. To be eligible to participate, an employee
   must be a regular civilian employee with thirty days of service as a regular employee. ODM
   are not eligible to participate. The basic provisions for administering the AF NAF 401(k)
   retirement plan, and for enrolling, terminating, and retiring employees are in AFI 34-315, Air
   Force Nonappropriated Fund Employee’s 401(k) Savings Plan.
       15.2.2.1. Joint Basing Provisions for 401(k) Savings Plan.
       15.2.2.1.1. AF NAF Employees Transferring to Other NAF as Supporting Service.
       Under Joint Basing, AF NAF employees who are moved to another NAF component may
       elect to remain in the AF NAF 401(k) Savings Plan. The Supporting employer will
       deduct the appropriate AF NAF employee contribution and forward to the AF NAF
       401(k) Savings Plan. The Supporting employer will also make the appropriate AF NAF
       employer matching contribution and forward to AF NAF 401(k) Savings Plan. For
       employees who are participating in FERS or CSRS, AF NAF will deduct the appropriate
       employee contributions, make employer matching contributions and forward to the APF
       system.
           15.2.2.1.2. NAF Employees Transferring to AF NAF as the Supporting Service.
           Under Joint Basing, eligible employees who become AF NAF employees may elect
           to retain their former Supported 401(k) retirement plan. AF NAF will deduct the
           appropriate employee contributions and forward to the Supported employer. AF NAF
           will also deduct the appropriate employer matching 401(k) contribution and forward
           to the Supported employer. For employees participating in the FERS or CSRS, the
           Supporting employer will deduct the appropriate employee contributions, make
           employer matching contributions and forward to the APF system.
           15.2.2.1.3. Under Joint Basing, all employees must keep their retirement plan and
           401(k) savings plan with one NAF (either the Supporting service or the Supported
           service). For example, if an employee elects to retain the AF NAF retirement plan
           then he must also retain the AF NAF 401(k) savings plan.
15.3. Disability. There is no separate program for disability retirement income for AF NAF
employees. Primary benefits are available under social security. In addition, although the NAF
Retirement Plan does not have provisions for disability retirement, plan participants who become
totally and permanently disabled may be eligible for disability annuity payments. Disability
annuity payments from the NAF Retirement Plan are only available for Retirement Plan
participants.
15.4. Group Life, Accidental Death and Dismemberment, and Health Insurance
Programs. These programs provide eligible employees with life, accidental death and
dismemberment, and health insurance protection at a moderate cost to the employer and
employee. This is the only AF-sponsored plan for which employing NAFIs are authorized to
contribute on behalf of NAF employees. The program may also include a qualified health
maintenance organization (HMO) alternative plan. The basic provisions for administering these
programs are in AFI 34-305, Nonappropriated Fund Employee Group Health Plan, and AFI 34-
306, Nonappropriated Fund Employee Group Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment
Plan.
184                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


   15.4.1. Participation is optional. The plan is a joint contributory one in which both the
   enrolled employee and employing NAFI share the costs. Generally, to be eligible to
   participate, an employee must be a regular civilian employee, and be employed by an
   AF NAFI in the U.S., or if employed outside the U.S., the employee must be a U.S. civilian
   (citizen, permanent resident, or non-citizen national of the U.S.) paid on the U.S. dollar
   payroll. Regular off-duty enlisted U.S. military personnel may not participate in the group
   health plan. Refer to AFI 34-305 and AFI 34-306 for specific participant eligibility.
   15.4.2. Newly hired regular employees are eligible to enroll anytime during the first thirty
   days of employment. Coverage is effective as of the first day immediately following the
   completion of the 30-day period after their date of hire, or reclassification to an eligible
   employment status. If an employee does not enroll during the first thirty days of regular
   employment, they may request to enroll at a later date, by submitting evidence of insurability
   to the Human Resources Office.
15.5. Flexible Benefits Plan (FBP). The AF NAF FBP allows NAF employees, and retirees,
who are enrolled in the NAF Group Health Insurance Plan, the option to pay their health plan
contributions with pre-tax earnings. The basic provisions for administering the FBP are in
AFI 34307, Nonappropriated Fund Employee Flexible Benefits Plan.
   15.5.1. Only employees enrolled in the NAF health plan are eligible to participate. If an
   employee is a participant in an HMO or a personal civilian health insurance plan, the
   employee is not eligible to participate in the FBP.
   15.5.2. An employee who enrolls in the health plan during the initial 30-day period
   following eligibility, may also enroll in the FBP. The effective date of FBP coverage is the
   same as the effective date of health plan coverage. If an employee enrolls in the health plan
   at some date after the 30-day period, he or she may not always be able to begin participation
   in the FBP at the same time he or she begins participation in the health plan. Employees
   enrolled in the FBP may not discontinue their health coverage until open season.
15.6. Social Security and Medicare.
   15.6.1. U.S. civilian NAF employees, with the exception of those participating in the CSRS
   through a portability election, must participate in social security. Both the employee and the
   employing NAFI contribute to the program, which provides employees with their primary
   retirement and disability insurance coverage. For eligible employees, the NAF Retirement
   Plan supplements the coverage provided by social security, with the benefits of the retirement
   plan being coordinated with the social security benefits.
   15.6.2. All U.S. civilian NAF employees must participate in the Hospital Insurance Program
   for Aged and Disabled (Medicare). Both the employee and the employing NAFI contribute
   to the program, which provides medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 or older, and
   persons receiving social security disability benefits for 24 months or more. Active
   employees, otherwise eligible, may continue to participate in the NAF group health plan
   while employed, regardless of their age. Retired and former employees may not participate
   in the group health plan after age 65. Individuals who are receiving Medicare benefits based
   on disability may not participate in the group health plan.
15.7. NAF Employee Workers' Compensation Program. NAF civilian employees in the 50
states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and other territories of the U.S., and U.S.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 185


citizens, U.S. nationals, or permanent residents of the U.S. in overseas areas, are eligible for
workers' compensation disability income and authorized medical expense benefits according to
the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. ODM personnel are excluded
from coverage. Local national (LN) employees are provided workers' compensation benefits
according to local law, treaty, agreement, or custom. Third-country national (TCN) employees
are provided workers' compensation benefits according to established local policy. Refer to
AFI 34-308, Nonappropriated Fund Workers’ Compensation Procedures, for details on handling
workers' compensation claims, including specific instructions on filling out mandatory AF and
Department of Labor forms in processing employee job-related accidents or illnesses.
15.8. NAF Employee Unemployment Compensation Program. The Unemployment
Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE), a part of the Social Security Act, became
effective 1 Jan 55 and is administered by the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary entered into
agreements with state employment security agencies (SESA) under which they, as agents of the
US, pay certain compensation to federal employees according to their respective unemployment
compensation laws. Included in the program are the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto
Rico, and the Virgin Islands. For the purpose of this program, federal service includes service as
a NAF employee. SESAs are reimbursed from NAF funds. The Department of Labor bills
federal agencies quarterly. Federal agencies reimburse the Federal Employees Compensation
Account for benefits paid out to NAF claimants by the SESAs. The NAF-HR and HQ
AFSVA/SVXHB administer the UCFE program for NAF employees.
   15.8.1. NAF-HRs ensure ES Form 931, Request for Wage and Separation Information–
   UCFE, and all other allied documents are completed and returned to SESA within four
   workdays after arrival on base.      Send information copies of all completed forms and
   documents to HQ AFSVA/SVXHB. NAF-HRs maintain a suspense log of ES Forms 931,
   state determinations, and appeal actions. Send copies of all ES Forms 931, state
   determinations, and appeal actions to HQ AFSVA/SVXHB. Use a suspense log to establish,
   record, and suspense follow-up actions with SESA for questionable-type separations. State
   laws define questionable-type separations as involuntary separation for cause, voluntary
   resignation without good cause, or refusal to accept a suitable job offer. Normal state
   processing procedures require an unemployment compensation determination within two
   weeks of the claim filing date. The NAF-HR will initiate written or telephone tracer action
   with the appropriate SESA when the NAF-HR has not received the determination within
   three weeks after it sent the completed ES Form 931 to the SESA. States normally deny
   unemployment compensation benefits for questionable-type separations; however, if the
   states allow benefits, NAF-HRs assist NAF managers in submitting substantiated appeal
   actions.
   15.8.2. The following instructions outline the procedures required to accomplish appeal
   actions. The appropriate activity manager is responsible for appealing SESA determinations,
   with the NAF-HR providing technical and administrative assistance. SESAs should send all
   determinations and hearing notices to the NAF-HR address on the SF 8, Notice to Federal
   Employee About Unemployment Insurance. Immediately forward incorrectly addressed or
   misrouted SESA determinations and notices to the NAF-HR for appropriate action. When it
   receives a questionable SESA determination, the NAF-HR contacts the responsible activity
   manager to determine whether an appeal is warranted. If so, the NAF-HR has a limited
   number of days to file an appeal. NAF-HRs obtain the servicing judge advocate’s (JA)
186                                                     AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      assistance when necessary. NAF-HRs send copies of all appeals and SESA decisions to
      AFSVA/SVXHB. The appropriate activity manager or supervisor, NAF-HR representative,
      and JA representative, if necessary, must appear in person at the appeal hearing (if
      geographically located in the vicinity of the base) with a well-documented case. Witnesses
      having first-hand knowledge of circumstances surrounding the separation should also be
      present. For hearings in locations outside the local area, the NAF-HR will contact the SESA
      office for documentation submission procedures, including witness affidavits in lieu of
      personal appearance.
      15.8.3. Refer to AFI 34-309, Nonappropriated Fund Unemployment Compensation (UC)
      Program, for additional information about processing unemployment compensation claims.

   and practices in those areas, and terms of country-to-country agreements and implementing
   directives.
      16.2.3. DoD Directive 1400.6, DoD Civilian Employees in Overseas Areas, February 15,
      1980, and DoDI 1400.25-V1231 prescribe the policies governing civilian personnel
      employed by DoD components in the US and overseas, and have been administratively

         Except in those instances where placement is made under the provisions of military
         spouse preference, THP and reemployment priority, first priority must be given to the
         employment of family members of military and civilian personnel assigned in the host
         country, when such actions are not at variance with the Status of Forces agreements,
         country-to-country agreements, treaties, or as prescribed by DoD Instruction 1400.23,
         Employment of Family Members of Active Duty Military Members and Civilian
         Employees Stationed in Foreign Areas.
            16.3.1.1.1. Family members are the spouse, or unmarried dependent children,
            including stepchildren, adopted children, and foster children not more than 23 years
            of age, residing with a member of the U.S. Armed Forces or a U.S. citizen civilian
            employee of a U.S. Government Agency.
            16.3.1.1.2. NAF-HRs and supervisors will afford family member preference to those
            applicants who meet the definition of a family member, when filling NAF positions
            competitively through external placement procedures. Family member preference
            eligibles will be given priority for appointment in the absence of a reemployment
            priority list, military spouse preference, or THP candidate. This priority applies only
            to initial employment into a continuing position, including temporary positions of one
            year, or longer, and can be used only once at each duty location. Family members
            shall not be given employment preference on the basis of sponsor's rank or position.
            Preference shall apply in foreign national positions to family members who are not
            U.S. citizens. However, such family members shall be employed under employment
            terms and conditions prescribed in host country legislation or agreements.
                16.3.1.1.2.1. Family members may file applications for employment with
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                            189


          overseas NAF-HR thirty days before their anticipated arrival within the
          command. However, family members may not receive preference until actually
          arriving at the overseas location. Family members who have less than six months
          remaining in the area may be non-selected for permanent continuing appointment.
          16.3.1.1.2.2. The appointment of family members preference eligibles must
          comply with statutes, regulations, and restrictions on employment of relatives.
          16.3.1.1.2.3. Installation commanders may approve exceptions to the selection of
          a family member preference eligible. Exceptions will be rare, and must be based
          on compelling hardship to the mission.
          16.3.1.1.2.4. Selecting supervisors prepare requests for exceptions and submit
          them to the NAF-HR.
          16.3.1.1.2.5. The NAF-HR staffs the request and obtains necessary coordination
          and approval. Documentation on exceptions is retained according to the AF RDS
          in AFRIMS.
          16.3.1.1.2.6. Verification of family member preference is the responsibility of the
          NAF-HR. The NAF-HR annotates the application for NAF employment with the
          family member preference eligibility. Documentation required to establish
          preference is the sponsor’s PCS orders naming the family member as a dependent,
          or a copy of the commander’s letter of approval of command sponsorship together
          with a copy of the sponsor’s PCS orders. NAF-HRs include the documentation
          verifying family member preference as part of the employee’s OPF when
          appointed.
       16.3.1.1.3. The employment of a family member of a military or civilian sponsor
       assigned to a host country may extend no longer than 60 days following the transfer
       of the sponsor from the commuting area of his or her duty station, the separation of
       the appointee’s sponsor, or beyond the time the employee ceases to be a family
       member. This time limit applies to the employment of all family members, regardless
       of whether they used any preference to obtain NAF employment.
          16.3.1.1.3.1. Once appointed, unmarried dependent children may be retained
          until their sponsor departs from the commuting area of his or her duty station or
          completes the current period of service requirement, whichever occurs first.
          16.3.1.1.3.2. NAF employees who are relocating to a new duty station because of
          a sponsor’s transfer, and are on LWOP may be retained on the NAFIs rolls until
          the expiration period of the LWOP.
          16.3.1.1.3.3. Installation commanders may approve extensions to the 60-day
          period for a period no longer than 1 year, when it is in the best interest of
          management or for humanitarian reasons, where there are no qualified and
          available military/DoD civilian family members in the local area, and when such
          action complies with the provisions of applicable Status of Forces Agreements,
          treaties or country-to-country agreements. Supervisors submit requests for
          extensions to the NAF-HR. Extensions must be fully documented, and filed on
          the left side of the OPF. When possible, employees should initiate requests for
190                                                   AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


             extensions through their supervisor at least 60 days in advance to allow for
             necessary processing and approvals.
             16.3.1.1.3.4. Extensions are not approved beyond the expiration of the
             employee’s entitlement to return transportation.
          16.3.1.1.4. The NAF-HR includes the following remark on appointment AF Form
          2545, ―This appointment will be terminated within 60 days following the date the
          employee ceases to be a dependent, or following the sponsor’s transfer from the
          commuting area or separation from service.‖
          16.3.1.1.5. Employees will submit a resignation from NAF employment when he/she
          is no longer eligible for appointment as a family member. LWOP may be requested
          for employees relocating with head of household. NAF-HRs will terminate
          employees who refuse to resign in the following manner:
             16.3.1.1.5.1. Provide a minimum of 20 hours advance, written notice of
             termination action.
             16.3.1.1.5.2. Include a statement that the termination is not grievable as the
             appointment is considered time-limited.
             16.3.1.1.5.3. Process Termination action for flexible employees and Termination-
             Without Prejudice action for regular employees. Include the following remark on
             AF Form 2545 termination action: ―Termination due to loss of status as a
             (dependent or off-duty military).‖
   16.3.2. U. S. Citizens Recruited in the U.S.
      16.3.2.1. When it has been determined that local nationals, U.S. citizens, or U.S.
      nationals residing in the host country do not possess the necessary training or experience
      for a particular NAFI position, civilian personnel may be recruited from the U.S. to fill
      these positions. In general, such personnel are limited to key management or supervisory
      positions and those positions regarded as essential for security reasons.
      16.3.2.2. Rates of pay for U.S. citizen NAFI employees who are recruited in the U.S. and
      its territories and possessions for overseas assignments are fixed in conformity with rates
      paid for work of a comparable level, difficulty, and responsibility to that of NAFI
      employees in the U.S.
      16.3.2.3. Family Members with Special Needs Traveling Overseas
          16.3.2.3.1. Family members of NAF employees appointed to an overseas position
          who meet criteria outlined in DoDI 1315.19, Authorizing Special Needs Family
          Members Travel Overseas at Government Expense, shall be identified as a family
          member with special medical needs.
          16.3.2.3.2. When recruiting for an overseas position, human resources offices shall
          include the following statements in recruitment information:
             16.3.2.3.2.1. ―If an employee brings a child to an overseas location and that child
             is entitled to attend the Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS) on

          School-age Dependents in Overseas Areas, the DoDDS and the Military
          Department responsible for providing related services shall ensure that the child,

          16.3.2.3.2.2. ―If an employee brings an infant or toddler (birth through age two
          years of age) to an overseas location, and that infant or toddler, but for age, is

          the Military Department responsible for providing Early Intervention Services
          (EIS) shall ensure that the infant or toddler, if eligible for EIS under DoD
          Instruction 1342.12, receives the required EIS.‖
          16.3.2.3.2.3. ―If an employee brings a family member to an overseas location that
          requires medical or dental care, the employee will be responsible for obtaining
          and paying for such care. Access for civilian employees and their families to
          military medical and dental treatment facilities is on a space-available and
          reimbursable basis only.‖
       16.3.2.3.3. Selection for specific positions will be based on job requirements and
       merit factors under Section 2302 of title 5, United States Code. The selection for an
       overseas position must not be affected by the special needs of an employee’s family
       member(s).
       16.3.2.3.4. Emphasis shall be placed on providing the employee or selectee with
       comprehensive medical, dental, and educational information on the community in the
       overseas area where the position is located to allow the employee or selectee to make
       an informed choice of accepting the position.
       16.3.2.3.5. Employees assigned to positions overseas are responsible for obtaining
       medical and dental services and paying for such services, except services provided
       pursuant to DoD Instruction 1342.12, Provision of Early Intervention and Special
       Education Services.
       16.3.2.3.6. NAF employees and their family members have access to the military

       shall be identified as a family member with special educational needs and eligible for
       Early Intervention Services (EIS) or special education or if they meet criteria outlined
       in DoDI 1315.19, E4.
          16.3.2.3.7.1. The DoDDS and the receiving military installation are required to
          provide school-aged children (ages 3 through 21 years) with necessary
          evaluations and the special education and related services stipulated in their
          Individualized Education Program (IEP), expeditiously and regardless of cost as
          prescribed in DoDI 1315.19.
       16.3.2.3.8. Military installations are required to provide infants and toddlers (birth

      Service Plan (IFSP), expeditiously and regardless of cost as prescribed in DoDI
      1315.19.
      16.3.2.3.9. The NAF-HR will provide information on the availability of medical and
      educational services, including a point of contact for the applicant to query about
      specific special needs. This information must be contained in any document used for
      recruitment for overseas positions.
      16.3.2.3.10. When the gaining human resources office processes an employee for an
      overseas position where family member travel is authorized at government expense,
      they shall:
         16.3.2.3.10.1. After notifying a selectee of his or her pending appointment for an
         overseas position, query him or her to determine whether a family member has
         special needs, using the criteria provided in enclosure 4 of DoDI 1315.19. It is
         unlawful to choose to query some selectees, but not others. All selectees must be
         so queried only after notification of their selection under the Rehabilitation Act,
         as amended, and part 1630.14 of Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (references
         (l) and (m)).
         16.3.2.3.10.2. The NAF-HR shall not subject the selectee to coercion or any other
         form of pressure to decline the job offer because he or she has a family member(s)
         with a special need(s).
         16.3.2.3.10.3. The selectee shall forward the following information, by the fastest

         16.3.2.3.10.4. The selectee will complete a DD Form 2792, Exceptional Family
         Member Medical Summary, for each family member with special medical needs.

         16.3.2.3.10.5. The selectee will complete a DD Form 2792-1, Exceptional Family
         Member Special Education/Early Intervention Summary, for each family member
         with special educational needs. Failure of an employee or selectee to complete
         the DD Form 2792-1 shall preclude the processing of an application for family
         travel and command sponsorship.
      16.3.2.3.11. The gaining NAF-HR responsible for processing the selectee to the
      overseas position shall obtain the information about the availability of required
      medical and dental care from the local military medical treatment facility(ies) and in
      the host nation community, the availability of special education programs from the
      DoDDS for children (3 through 21 years of age) with disabilities, the availability of
      EIS for infants and toddlers, birth through age two years of age, with developmental
      disabilities from the Educational and Developmental Intervention Services.
         16.3.2.3.11.1. When the information is received, the gaining NAF-HR shall
         inform the selectee, in writing, of the availability of medical, educational, and
         early interventions resources and services to allow the employee to make an
         informed choice of accepting the position. The notice shall include information
         about medical and dental care available in the local military medical treatment
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 193


             facility(ies), a description of the local DoDDS facility(ies) and programs,
             specifying the established programs for children with educational disabilities; and
             a description of the local EIS available for infants and toddlers with
             developmental delays. The notice must also include a statement indicating that
             the lack of EIS or special education resources (including related services assigned
             to the Military medical Departments) cannot serve as a basis for the denial of
             family travel at government expense, and shall be provided even if a local
             program is not currently established.
  16.3.3. Employment of Non-US Citizens. The employment of non-US citizens by the
  Armed Forces overseas is covered by DoDI 1400.25-V1231. DoD Directive 1400.6, DoD
  Civilian Employees in Overseas Areas, is the basic DoD policy governing civilian personnel
  of the DoD in overseas areas.
     16.3.3.1. LNs. Local laws and customs are followed in the employment and
     administration of local nationals to the extent that such laws and customs are compatible
     with the basic management needs of the Armed Forces.
     16.3.3.2. TCNs. The importation of workers from another country by a NAFI are only
     made when personnel requirements cannot be met by local hire. When it becomes
     necessary to do so, arrangements are made with the host government to permit
     importation of workers who are acceptable to the host country.
     16.3.3.3. Resident Aliens. Resident aliens are employed in accordance with the host
     country agreements.
  16.3.4. Allowances and Differentials. Overseas allowances and differentials (except the
  post allowance) are not automatic salary supplements, nor are they entitlements. They are
  specifically intended to be recruitment incentives for U.S. citizen civilian employees living in
  the U.S. to accept Federal employment in a foreign area. If a person is already living in the
  foreign area, that inducement is normally unnecessary. Individuals shall not automatically be
  granted these per DoDI 1400.25-V1250.
     16.3.4.1. Allowances and differentials are paid to NF-III through NF-VI employees
     recruited in the U.S. who meet the eligibility requirement contained in section 030 of the
     Department of State Standardized Regulations (Government civilians, Foreign Areas) and
     whose rates of basic compensation are fixed in conformity with rates paid for work of a
     comparable level of difficulty and responsibility to that of employees stationed in the
     U.S., exclusive of Alaska and Hawaii.
     16.3.4.2. The types of allowances and differentials that are prescribed are the same as
     those provided for APF, US citizen DoD employees in the locality, except that education
     may be provided for eligible dependents, or an education allowance may be paid, as
     authorized in DoDI 1400.25-V1250.
     16.3.4.3. Executive Order 11137, ―Relating to certain allowances and benefits for
     civilian employees of NAFI of the Armed Forces, January 7, 1964, authorizes the DoD to
     prescribe regulations providing allowances and differentials in foreign areas to DoD NAF
     employees. With exception of post allowance, it is DoD policy that the payment of
     allowances and differentials to NAF employees in foreign areas shall be made on the
194                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      same basis as such allowances and differentials are paid to DoD APF employees under
      Volume 1250, ―Overseas Allowances and Differentials‖ of DoDI 1400.25.
      16.3.4.4. Post Allowance. "Post allowance" means a cost-of-living allowance granted to
      an employee, as defined in para 16.3.4.4.1., officially stationed at a post in a foreign area
      where the cost of living, exclusive of quarters costs, is substantially higher than in
      Washington, D.C. The post allowance is designed to permit employees to spend the
      same portion of their basic compensation for current living as they would in Washington,
      D.C., without incurring a reduction in their standard of living because of higher costs of
      goods and services at the post. The payment of post allowance to locally hired
      employees who were/are recruited outside the United States since 6 May 09 is not
      authorized.
          16.3.4.4.1. Post Allowance Eligibility: To be eligible for post allowance, a NAF
          employee must be a U.S. citizen and employed in a Regular position with a
          guaranteed 40-hours per week or who regularly works 40 hours per week over a 13
          pay period time-frame. Those regular employees who work less than the required 40
          hours per week, flexible employees, and seasonal (summer/winter) hire employees
          are not eligible for post allowance. Eligible employees receive post allowance per
          instructions contained in section 220 of the Department of State Standardized
          Regulations.
   16.3.5. Travel and Transportation. Travel of NAF employees and their family members,
   renewal agreement travel, and transportation of household goods and personal effects,
   including privately owned vehicles, in connection with assignments, PCS, and separation are
   authorized at the NAFI expense. Career program moves are centrally funded. These
   expenses are paid according to those eligibility requirements and rates of payment,
   limitations, and conditions prescribed by the Joint Travel Regulation (JTR), Volume 2, for
   U.S. citizen employees in the same locality who are paid from APFs.
   16.3.6. Entitlement to Government Quarters and Facilities.
      16.3.6.1. NAFI employees in positions for which it is necessary to recruit from the U.S.
      are accorded full membership in the joint overseas military and civilian team to which
      they make a significant support contribution. Each overseas military commander
      provides facilities under his or her jurisdiction, including government quarters and family
      housing, to NAFI personnel in accordance with the policies set forth in DoDI 1400.25-
      V1231 and          AFI 32-6001, Family Housing Management and AFI 326005,
      Unaccompanied Housing Management. The principle of equal treatment of NAFI
      personnel with APF personnel at equivalent grade levels is followed.
      16.3.6.2. U.S. citizen and U.S. national NAFI personnel traveling on official business
      may occupy temporary government quarters, including guesthouses, under the same
      terms and with the same eligibility as APF personnel.
   16.3.7. Medical and Health Services. U.S. citizen and U.S. national NAFI employees have
   access to the same medical and health service provided APF personnel.
   16.3.8. Privileges. U.S. citizen and U.S. national NAFI personnel are afforded the same
   privileges provided their counterparts who are APF civilian personnel in the same overseas
   areas, to the extent permitted by country-to-country agreements. These include commissary,
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               195


  exchange, laundry, transportation, postal services (APO and FPO), recreation, and religious
  facilities. The basis for extending the privileges of clubs will be according to grade and
  position responsibility, as determined by installation commanders.
  16.3.9. Home Leave Entitlement. The provisions of DoDI 1400.25-V1260 govern home
  leave for eligible NAFI employees recruited in the US and employed in overseas areas.
  Home leave is authorized after an employee has completed 24 months of continuous service
  abroad. Service abroad means service on and after 6 September 1960, by an employee at a
  post of duty outside the United States and outside the employee’s place of residence if his
  place of residence is in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or a territory or possession of the
  United States. Home leave is earned at a rate of 5, 10, or 15 days based on the number of
  months of service abroad and criteria in 5 CFR 630.604. (See 5 CFR 630.605(a) for Home
  Leave-Earning Table.)
     16.3.9.1. Subsequent Service Abroad. In accordance with 5 CFR 630.606(c)(2) and
     DoDI 1400.25-V1260, home leave may be granted only when an employee has
     completed 24 months of continuous service abroad. Home leave not granted during an
     employee’s period of service abroad, or within a reasonable period after returning from
     service abroad when it is contemplated that the employee will return to service abroad
     immediately or on completion of an assignment in the United States, may be granted only
     when the employee has completed a further substantial period of service abroad. This
     further substantial period of service abroad may not be less than the tour of duty
     prescribed for the employee’s post of assignment, except when the responsible Major
     Command/A1K, or designee, determines that an earlier and shorter grant of home leave is
     warranted on a case-by-case basis.
     16.3.9.2. Refund for Home Leave. An employee is indebted for the home leave used
     by him/her when he/she fails to return to service abroad after the period of home leave, or
     after the completion of an assignment in the United States. However, a refund for this
     indebtedness is not required when (1) the employee has completed not less than 6
     months’ service in an assignment in the United States following the period of home
     leave; (2) the agency determines that the employee’s failure to return was due to
     compelling personal reasons of a humanitarian or compassionate nature, such as may
     involve physical or mental health or circumstances over which the employee has no
     control; or (3) the agency which granted the home leave determines that it is in the public
     interest not to return the employee to his overseas assignment.
  16.3.10. Leave Accumulation. Authorized NAF employees accumulate and carry over to
  another leave year a maximum of 360 hours of annual leave, according to those rules that
  apply to U.S. citizens paid from APFs.
  16.3.11. Renewal Agreement Travel (RAT). Employees who have completed the agreed
  period of continuous creditable service outside the U.S., and outside the employee's place of
  residence if such residence is in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or in any of the
  possessions of the U.S.; and who agree in writing to serve an additional tour of duty at the
  same or another overseas NAFI, are authorized renewal agreement travel at the expense of
  the employing NAFI. Renewal agreement travel is centrally funded for career program
  employees. For more information about RAT refer to JTR Vol 2, C5500.
196                                                       AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


         16.3.11.1. Renewal agreement travel is allowed from an employee's overseas post of
         duty to his or her place of actual residence at the time of appointment or transfer and for
         the employee's return to the same or another overseas post of duty.
         16.3.11.2. Time is not charged to leave while in a travel status as long as the travel is by
         the most direct route.
         16.3.11.3. Upon reaching place of actual residence, the employee is charged annual
         leave, home leave, or LWOP, as appropriate.
      16.3.12. Leave and Travel for Emergencies. Emergency leave may be granted to U.S.
      citizen and U.S. national NAFI employees assigned outside the U.S. and entitled to return
      transportation in cases of emergencies, such as serious injury, illness, or death in the
      employee's family located in the U.S. The period of emergency leave may be requested
      under FMLA procedures contained in Chapter 14. If the employee has no accrued leave, he
      or she may be placed in a LWOP status. Such employees are provided government
      transportation on a space-available basis at no cost to the NAFI. Red Cross confirmation of
      the emergency must be secured prior to the approval of the leave and transportation.
   16.3.13. Local Holidays in Foreign Countries. Local national NAFI employees may be
   authorized time off to observe certain local national holidays. Such authorization is subject
   to country-to-country agreements. When all or part of an installation is closed in observance
   of such a local holiday and, as a result, U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals and third country
   nationals are thereby prevented from working, they are assigned to other work if possible.
   Otherwise, such employees are excused without charge to leave or loss of pay.
  16.3.14. Employee Benefits. Insurance, retirement, medical, and other employee benefits
  for local national NAFI employees are established by agreements with the host country.
  16.3.15. Employees funded by APF and NAF are entitled to certain mortuary entitlements.
  Civilian employees eligible for mortuary entitlements include those employees who die
  while:
         16.3.15.1. Serving with or without a transportation agreement to include locally hired
         employees at an overseas duty station.
         16.3.15.2. On a temporary duty assignment or while en route to a temporary duty
         assignment within or outside the continental United States. (NOTE: The member must
         be on official travel orders to be eligible for entitlements under this category.) Assigned
         at a permanent duty station outside the 50 states, or traveling to or from such station.
         16.3.15.3. NAF Employee in OCONUS are entitled to Search and Recovery,
         identification, preparation, restoration, cosmetics, cremation, dressing, casket, urn, outer
         shipping container and transportation to the place of interment at a point no further
         distant than the last place of residence or assigned station within CONUS on a
         reimbursable basis as authorized by AFI 34242, Mortuary Affairs Program. All items
         and expenses to be furnished by the government on a reimbursable basis will be billed to
         and funded by the employing NAFI. These benefits are not provided to NAF employees
         who are family members of U.S. military or civil service employees who would
         otherwise be entitled to such care and disposition of remains from APFs.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               197


         16.3.15.3.1. Dependents of NAF Employees who die while residing at or traveling to
         or from the employee’s permanent duty station outside the CONUS are entitled to
         transportation, to include the outside shipping container, from place of death to the
         place of interment or a point no further distant than the employee’s last place of
         residence or assigned station within CONUS and consulate fees for shipping
         documents and sealing the caskets. Expenses will be billed to and funded by the
         employing NAFI. The sponsor or person authorized to direct disposition (PADD)
         must pay the cost for care and preparation of the remains.
  16.3.16. The policies and procedures in AFI 10-216, Evacuating and Repatriating Air Force
  Family Members and Other U.S. Noncombatants, apply to NAF employees moved from one
  overseas area to another, or from one overseas area to the CONUS.
     16.3.16.1. Locally hired U.S. citizens and third-country nationals who do not have an
     agreement for return transportation at government expense are not entitled to evacuation
     at government expense. However, they (including family members) may be evacuated if
     transportation is available. No travel entitlements are payable.
     16.3.16.2. NAF employees who have travel agreements, and their family members are
     entitled to evacuation travel and financial assistance according to criteria established in
     the State Department Standard Regulations, Chapter 600.

                                           Chapter 17

                               POSITION CLASSIFICATION

17.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes AF procedures and responsibilities for supporting and
maintaining the NAF Position Classification Program and the Job Grading Review and Appeals
System.
17.2. Classification Authority. NAF positions are classified according to those pay categories
explained in paragraph 17.3, consistent with the intent of Public Law 92392, OPM directives,
and DoD policies and directives.
17.3. Systems for Classifying and Paying Positions. NAF positions are classified into one of
three major pay setting systems. These are:
      17.3.1. Crafts and Trades (CT) Federal Wage System (NA, NL, and NS).
   17.3.2. Payband Classification and Pay System for White-Collar (Non-Crafts and Trades)
   NAF Employees
   17.3.3. Child Care Payband System (CY-01 through CY-05).
   17.3.4. Administrative Support (AS), Patron Services (PS), and Universal Annual (UA).
   The principles of DoD 1401.1-M are administratively extended to cover these positions.
   These positions shall be converted to the pay band system consistent with labor relations
   obligations.
17.4. NAF Crafts and Trades (NA, NL, and NS):
   17.4.1. The CT category includes positions in a recognized craft or trade, or in an unskilled,
   semiskilled, or skilled annual labor occupation, including supervisory and leader positions
   having craft, trade, or laboring experience and knowledge as paramount requirements.
   Positions in this pay system typically include food service worker, maintenance worker,
   cook, mechanic, bartender, etc.
   17.4.2. There are three pay schedules under the NAF CT pay plan which cover
   nonsupervisory (NA), leader (NL), and supervisory (NS) positions. The NA and NL pay
   schedules consist of 15 grades with five steps in each grade. The NS pay schedule consists
   of 19 grades with five steps in each grade. New employees normally start at Step 1 and
   progress through the five steps after completion of specific waiting periods.
17.5. NAF Pay band. The NAF pay band system provides for six pay bands. Each pay band
has a minimum and maximum salary. Employees are paid any salary within the pay band in
which their position is classified. There are no automatic within-grade increases (WGIs) in this
system. Pay adjustments may be granted at any time as deemed appropriate by management.
The NF pay band system includes three general categories of positions:
   17.5.1. Positions responsible for secretarial, clerical, or administrative functions in an office
   or nonmanual environment. This includes positions in inventory management, accounting,
   procurement, personnel, payroll, etc. Positions in this category may include clerks, clerk-
   typist, secretary, accounting clerk, office automation, cashier, etc.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   199


   17.5.2. Positions responsible for retail selling, providing recreation, amusement, and
   personal services, protecting facilities and merchandise, etc. Positions in this category may
   include recreation aid/assistant, sales clerk, club operations assistant, etc.
   17.5.3. Managerial, executive, technical or professional positions responsible for the
   development and implementation of management policies or general business operations
   when administering, managing, or performing work in an office, business, or fiscal operation.
   Positions in this category may include caterer, activity managers, accountant, restaurant
   manager, human resources officer, etc.
17.6. CY. Standardized AF PGs are mandatory for use in the classification of CY positions.
The CY pay band system provides for two pay bands. Pay band I covers grades CY01 and
CY02, and pay band II covers grades CY03 through CY05. Each of the two bands has a
minimum and maximum salary. There are no automatic WGIs in this system. Pay adjustments
may be granted at any time deemed appropriate by management. Pay for CY positions is
administered according to CY Pay System Program Guidance, Chapter 19.
17.7. Terms Explained. Terms used in the NAF Personnel Position Classification Program are:
   17.7.1. Audit. A personal interview by an NAF-HR specialist with the incumbent of a NAF
   position to clarify, determine, and document or verify the current duties, usually at the work
   location. The purpose of an audit is to gain as much information as possible about the
   position. This information, combined with an analysis of other available material about the
   job and the organization, can help to verify details and resolve questions. A supervisory
   audit may be held solely with the first line supervisor who has complete knowledge of the
   duties and responsibilities of the position being reviewed, so that adequate information can
   be obtained about the job.
   17.7.2. Evaluation Statement. A statement prepared by the NAF-HR to record and clarify
   the basis by which the position title, occupational series, and grade were determined when
   classifying a position. Evaluation statements must be prepared for positions where there is
   no single standard by which a position may be classified (e.g., positions with mixed duties),
   for supervisory positions, when an occupied position is downgraded, and for any other
   position deemed appropriate by the NAF-HR. A well thought out evaluation statement
   provides a clear picture of how the series, grade, and title of a position was classified.
   Evaluation statements must be maintained with the original PG/PD. An evaluation statement
   does two things:
       17.7.2.1. Make clear why the position belongs in the occupational series being
       recommended (and why it does not belong in some other related series), and
       17.7.2.2. Why it belongs in the grade being recommended rather than the next higher or
       lower grade.
       17.7.2.3. Since the selection of the standard(s) to be used for evaluation relates directly
       to the series, the first issue to be dealt with should be the series determination; the grade
       determination will be the second part of the report.
          17.7.2.3.1. Series and Title Determination. This area of the evaluation statement
          provides information as to how the series and title of the position are determined. As
          a minimum, a statement, which expresses the essence of the kind of work performed
200                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


         by the incumbent, is given, and linked to sufficient language from the series
         definitions to demonstrate the work of the position belongs in the series. For
         example: This position involves assisting in sports and/or outdoor recreation
         activities. The Position Classification Series, NF-0189 covers all positions which…‖
         If there is any reasonable question as to whether the position belongs in one series
         versus another, the reasons for the conclusion reached are given. If there is a ―close‖
         decision as between two closely related series, there is an explanation as to why the
         position fits the one better than the other. If the leader or supervisory guide is used, it
         is referenced and an explanation of how it was applied is provided. For example:
         Does the position require supervising employees? If so, how many employees are
         supervised? Why is the leader guide, or the supervisory guide being used? How does
         the position meet the criteria for the leader or supervisory guide? How was the title
         determined? Is a title prescribed by the standard? If a title is not prescribed by the
         standard, how was the title determined; is it descriptive of the type of work
         performed? Attachment 11 provides a list of commonly used and authorized NAF
         position titles and occupational series.
         17.7.2.3.2. Grade Determination. This area of the evaluation statement provides
         information about the job-grading standard used to determine the grade of the
         position. This is usually the most difficult part of the evaluation report. It should not
         only show step by step the intermediate conclusions which became a basis for the
         final conclusion; it clearly shows the reasons for those conclusions. In other words, it
         is not enough to say ―The position matches NA-06 with respect to the factors ―Skill
         and Knowledge‖, ―Responsibility‖, ―Physical Effort‖ and ―Working Conditions;‖
         therefore it is a NA-06.‖ How and why does the position match the NA-06
         characteristics? (What are the NA-06 characteristics? How are they different from
         NA-05? Match NA-06? How does it fail to meet NA-07?). The discussion shows,
         by excerpts from, or honest digests of, the standards why, for each factor, the position
         exceeds the level below, and falls short of the level above, the level which it is
         intended to match. This discussion is the heart of the evaluation; to be useful it must
         be more than conclusions. The statement that ―the skill and knowledge exceeds the
         NA-07 level, and falls short of the NA-10 level skill and knowledge‖ may be
         perfectly true, but it is a conclusion. Where cross-series comparisons must be used, a
         similar requirement applies: Treat the position, factor by factor, against the
         standard(s) selected, but recognize and point out differences and similarities in the
         general nature of the two occupations involved.
      17.7.2.4. The length of an evaluation statement will vary with the complexity of the job,
      the standard, and the comparisons involved. Ordinarily, it should not be more than one or
      two pages long. The crucial question is: Have the principal reasons for the classification
      decision been documented– clearly and persuasively, with enough factual data from the
      position and from the standards, to substantiate the conclusion.
  17.7.3. Position Descriptions (PD). A PD is a written statement that describes the
  functional location, purpose, primary duties and responsibilities, supervisory guidance and
  relationship, and significant facts concerning the position.         Use AF Form 1065,
  Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Civilian Position Description, for this purpose. A PD is
  prepared for all CT positions.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                201


   17.7.4. Position Guide (PG). AF Form 1702, Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Position
   Guide, is a multipurpose form which records the primary duties and responsibilities,
   qualifications, performance standards, and training requirements of NAF positions. A PG is
   prepared for all NAF positions.
   17.7.5. AF NAF Standardized Position Description (SPD)/Standardized Position Guide
   (SPG).
      17.7.5.1. In order to provide assistance to NAF-HRs and managers of NAF employees,
      many SPDs/SPGs applicable to common NAF positions across the Air Force were
      developed for use. The SPD/SPG library is on the HQ AFSVA web site at
      https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-DP-
      AE-12-35-18&Filter=OO-DP-AE-12. The library facilitates classification consistency,
      saves writing new PDs and PGs, saves time classifying new positions, and expedites the
      recruitment process.
      17.7.5.2. The AF NAF SPDs/SPGs are not designed to represent all work found in a
      specific occupational series; but, work most commonly found in the series throughout AF
      NAF activities. To insure the SPDs/SPGs represent common work situations, each
      SPD/SPG has been coordinated by representatives in the HQ AFSVA functional
      community where the work is typically found. Since the SPDs/SPGs are designed to
      represent typical work situations, you may find them to be more generic than you see in
      individually prepared PDs and PGs. To fit local requirements, minor changes to
      SPDs/SPGs may be made as long as they do not alter the classification or staffing pattern.
      If there is an impact to the classification or staffing pattern, the SPD/SPG is no longer
      valid and a local PD/PG must be developed with a local position number. The use of a
      SPG/SPD is appropriate only if the document accurately describes the local work
      situation. SPDs/SPGs are not meant to upgrade or downgrade existing positions; but to
      describe positions as they currently exist across the Air Force. Implementation of a
      SPG/SPD that results in a change in classification of an existing position should be
      carefully reviewed. The use of SPDs/SPGs does not relieve the supervisor or NAF-HR
      of the responsibility to ensure the SPD/SPG accurately describes the position under
      review. The application of SPDs/SPGs to specific positions can occur at any time
      mutually agreed upon by the supervisor and the NAF-HR.
17.8. Responsibilities of Managers and Supervisors.
   17.8.1. Determine the duties and responsibilities assigned to a position.
   17.8.2. Use AF SPDs and SPGs when major duties of positions are substantially identifiable
   with those in the standard PD or PG.
      17.8.2.1. When a standardized PD or PG is not applicable, prepare the PD or PG and
      forward it to the NAF-HR for classification. A PD or PG describes the regular and
      recurring duties to be performed in a position. It is not intended to cover every minor
      duty, whether temporary or permanent in nature. Other incidental tasks or duties may be
      required of an employee in order to operate the organization successfully.
   17.8.3. Promptly report significant changes in duties and responsibilities of positions to the
   NAF-HR. PDs and PGs are reviewed annually to ensure that they are accurate.
202                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


   17.8.4. Advise employees at least annually of their right to review classification standards
   and of their grievance and appeal rights.
17.9. Writing PDs and PGs.
   17.9.1. The duties and responsibilities for CT positions are recorded on AF Form 1065,
   Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Civilian Position Description. Standardized AF PDs are used
   to the maximum extent possible. These PDs are maintained in the NAF-HR. In addition to
   the AF Form 1065, an AF Form 1702, Nonappropriated fund (NAF) Position Guide, is
   developed and attached to each CT PD. The duties and responsibilities block of the PG is not
   completed. Refer to the PD by annotating "SEE ATTACHED" in this block. All other
   blocks on the PG are completed.
   17.9.2. Record the duties and responsibilities for pay band positions on the AF Form 1702.
   In addition to duties and responsibilities, the supervisor completes the qualifications,
   performance standards and training blocks on the PG. Standardized AF PGs are maintained
   in the NAF-HR and are used to the maximum extent possible. Standardized PGs are
   mandatory for all CY positions, and where provided, career program positions. Prior
   approval of Career Program is required to change a covered position.
17.10. The Classification Process.
   17.10.1. The classification process includes:
       17.10.1.1. Obtaining the facts about a position, primarily through an audit technique, and
       obtaining copies of organizational charts and PGs/PDs of other positions in the work
       area.
       17.10.1.2. Studying these facts critically.
       17.10.1.3. Determining the pay plan, series, and grade or pay band in the classification
       standards or guides that apply.
       17.10.1.3.1. Use the Handbook of Occupational Groups and Families to determine the
       appropriate group and series for the position being classified. Once the series is
       determined, the standard for the appropriate series may be found at the www.opm.gov
       website.
          17.10.1.3.2. The Classifier’s Handbook may be used as another resource to assist in
          the classification process. Each position should be classified to the appropriate series
          and grade according to standards issued by OPM. If no directly applicable standard
          has been issued, then positions must be classified consistent with OPM standards
          covering other occupations. For most positions, the published standard for the series
          in which the position is classified will provide the best grade level criteria for
          evaluating the position. Other standards would be used primarily to confirm the
          initial evaluation. When no directly applicable grade level criteria have been
          published, the classifier must select other standards for cross series comparison.
          Select standards that cover work as similar as possible to the work being evaluated
          with respect to:

            17.10.1.3.2.4. The combination of classification factors that have the greatest
            influence on the grade level.
     17.10.1.4. Determining the FLSA status of the position by applying the instructions in
     Attachment 10.
  17.10.2. The person analyzing and classifying a position must understand:
     17.10.2.1. The function of the organization in which it is located.
     17.10.2.2. The reason for the position's existence; that is, management's intent as to the
     purpose of the position assignment.

     17.10.2.5. Any other significant characteristics which contribute to its value.
  17.10.3. Classifying CT Positions:

     Federal Wage System, NAF, Subchapter S6 and OPM Job Grading Standards for Trades
     and Labor Occupations. Supplemental guidelines are included in DoD Manual
     1401.1.M-1.
     17.10.3.2. Noncovered Positions. Individual NAF positions that are not covered by
     standardized PDs and cannot be classified by direct reference to DoDM 1401.1M1 or
     published OPM classification standards are classified locally by applying related
     standards. If the action involves 25 or more identical positions, the NAF-HR provides a
     copy of the PD and rationale for the allocation through their MAJCOM/A1S to HQ
     AFSVA/SVXH for review and post audit.
     17.10.3.3. Applying New Standards. The servicing NAF-HR applies newly published
     or revised standards, unless otherwise directed, as follows:
         17.10.3.3.1. OPM standards are applied to CT positions in the same time frame they
         are applied to Federal Wage System positions, unless specific DoD NAF job grading
         guides and standards exist. NAF-HRs will take appropriate action within six months
         from the effective date of the new/revised standard.
         17.10.3.3.2. DoD NAF job grading guides and standards are applied within 6 months
         from the date of receipt.
  17.10.4. Classifying NF Positions. Classification guidelines for NF positions are graded
  (assigned to the proper pay band level) consistent with DoDI 1400.25-V1405 and
  Attachment 10 of this manual.
     17.10.4.1. AF NAF Classification Standards. NAF-HRs will use the AF NAF
     classification standards when classifying Club Manager and Assistant Manager, Golf
     Course Manager and Assistant Manager, and Golf Course Superintendent and Assistant
204                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      Superintendent positions. The standards were developed in conjunction with the
      functional community. The classification criteria within these standards provides
      uniformity and equity in the classification of these positions across the Air Force. They
      are        found       on         the        HQ          AFSVA           website       at:

      12-35-18&Filter=OO-DP-AE-12
      17.10.4.2. Establishing an NF-V position. When establishing an NF-V position, a
      request package must be submitted through the MAJCOM/A1S to HQ AFSVA/SVXH to
      be forwarded to HQ USAF/A1S for approval or disapproval. The following information
      must be included in the package:
          17.10.4.2.1. Current Position Guide
          17.10.4.2.2. Organizational Chart
          17.10.4.2.3. Proposed classified Position Guide
      17.10.4.2.4. An evaluation statement explaining how the position was classified and
      reasons the position is being classified as an NF-V (i.e., what changed that caused the
      position to be graded at NF-V)

   17.10.5. Classifying CY Positions. Positions directly involved in the care and supervision
   of children in a Military Child Development Center (CDC) and Youth Center shall be placed
   in the CY category. The CY category does not include home-based childcare providers or
   CDC administrative and support personnel such as cooks, janitors, and clerical assistants.
   Use of AF NAF SPGs for CY positions are mandatory. They are found on the HQ AFSVA
   website                                                                                 at:

   AE-12-35-18&Filter=OO-DP-AE-12.
  17.10.6. Classifying Mixed Jobs. A mixed job involves performance of duties in two or
  more occupations at the same or different pay levels or plans on a regular and recurring basis.
  A mixed job is graded based on the duties that involve the highest skill and qualification
  requirements. The pay plan for a mixed job with both FWS and NAF Pay band System
  duties is determined as follows:
      17.10.6.1. The position must be classified based on its ―paramount requirements.‖
      Paramount requirements relate to knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to perform the
      primary duty or responsibility of the position. The primary duty is the duty that
      constitutes the basic reason for the existence of the position and governs the qualification
      requirements. If a position requires trades, crafts, or laboring experience and knowledge
      for the performance of its primary duty, and this requirement is paramount, the position is
      a FWS position and shall be so classified.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 205


       17.10.6.2. A position is classified under the NAF Pay band System if its primary duty
       requires knowledge or experience of an administrative, clerical, services, business
       management, or technical nature not related to trades, crafts, or manual labor-work.
17.11. Effecting Actions on Classification Decisions. The classification decision of a higher
headquarters binds the installation or command concerned. The servicing NAF-HR applies a
higher headquarters’ decision not later than the beginning of the fourth pay period following the
date of the decision, unless the decision specifies a different date.
17.12. Maintaining Records.
   17.12.1. NAF-HRs maintain a complete file of current official PDs and PGs, evaluation
   statements (if applicable), organization charts, and survey records for serviced organizations.
   Organization charts show the organizational location, employment category, pay plan, title,
   series, grade or pay band, and position number of all positions within each organization. It is
   structured to reflect the chain of command for all positions clearly.
   17.12.2. Each supervisor maintains or has readily available:
       17.12.2.1. A current functional statement.
       17.12.2.2. A current organization chart.
       17.12.2.3. Copies of AF Form 1065, Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Civilian Position
       Description, and AF Form 1702, Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Position Guide, for all

   pay system, grade or pay band, series, or title of his or her officially assigned position.
   17.13.2. Publicity Requirements. The NAF-HR informs employees of their classification
   appeal rights and responsibilities at least annually.

       locality wage schedules; applicable amount of environmental differentials, shift
       differentials, Sunday and holiday premium pay, and overtime pay; step rates within a
       grade; and the pay resulting from a change between pay plans or occupational categories.
       17.13.3.4. An otherwise acceptable appeal in which the employee alleges discrimination
       because of race, color, religion, sex, age, handicap, or national origin.
   17.13.4. Employee's Right to Representation. An employee has the right to be assisted
   and advised in preparing the appeal by a representative of his or her own choosing, unless
   there is a conflict of interest, such as an employee of the servicing NAF-HR. The
   representative is designated in writing and is notified in writing of the decision. Any
   employee who submits an appeal and any employee who acts as the appellant's representative
206                                                        AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      is assured freedom from restraint, interference, coercion, discrimination, or reprisal because
      of participation in the appeal process. The employee, and any employee acting as that
      employee’s representative, are given a reasonable amount of official time to prepare the
      appeal.
      17.13.5. Responsibilities.
         17.13.5.1. Employees submitting an appeal promptly furnish all information required to
         process the appeal, and if they desire to withdraw the appeal, promptly inform the NAF-
         HR in writing.
         17.13.5.2. Supervisors explain the basis of the classification of their positions to
         employees, with assistance from the NAF-HR when required; advise employees of their
         appeal rights and the procedures to follow for submitting an appeal; resolve questions as
         to adequacy and accuracy of duties and responsibilities in official PDs and PGs; and
         promptly inform the NAF-HR of any significant changes in duties and responsibilities of
         a position on which an appeal decision is pending.
         17.13.5.3. The NAF-HR, acting for the FSS commander/director, attempts to resolve
         classification disagreements; makes accessible to all supervisors, employees, and
         employee representatives copies of classification standards, guidelines, precedent
         decisions, and other information upon which a classification decision is based; provides
         the employee with a written statement explaining the proper classification of his or her
         position; and advises and assists employees on the procedural aspects of filing an appeal.
      17.13.6. Who May File an Appeal. An appeal may be filed by an employee individually or
      on behalf of a group of employees occupying identical positions (having the same pay plan,
      title, series, grade or pay band, and position number). All members of a group action sign the
      appeal, and their representative, if any, must be designated in writing.
      17.13.7. General Time Limits for Filing an Appeal. An employee may appeal the
      classification of his or her position at any time. Entitlement to retroactive benefits is subject
      to the special rules explained in paragraph 17.13.8. An employee may not file an appeal on a

      local classification action must be received by the employee before such an appeal can be
      filed.
      17.13.8. Special Time Limits for Protection of Retroactive Benefits. An employee who
      files an appeal may be entitled to retroactive benefits when a decision reverses a
      classification action that resulted in a downgrade or a loss of compensation. To preserve the
      employee's entitlement to retroactive benefits, time limits for filing are stated in the final
      notice of change to the lower grade. To be timely:
         17.13.8.1. An employee's first appeal is filed no later than 15 calendar days after the
         effective date of the downgrade action.

     17.13.15.1. Retroactive Action. The personnel action to correct a loss of grade or pay
     band, or compensation (or both) resulting from a classification appeal decision is
     retroactive if the employee's appeal was submitted within the specified time limits.
        17.13.15.1.1. When a decision is made that the grade, pay band, or compensation
        held before the appeal is correct, the change to lower grade or pay band is cancelled
        and the employee's pay is adjusted retroactively to the date of the change to the lower
        grade or pay band. The employee is restored to the grade and step rate or pay band
        that he or she would have held if the change to the lower grade or pay band had not
        been taken.
        17.13.15.1.2. When the decision changes the grade or pay band to an intermediate
        grade or pay band, the employee is retroactively restored to the intermediate grade or
        pay band. This action corrects the initial change to the lower grade or pay band, and
        the employee's pay is adjusted retroactively to the date of the initial change.
        17.13.15.1.3. When the decision increases the grade or pay band to a level above that
        held before the change to lower grade or pay band, the action must be canceled; but,
        the retroactive provision applies only to the employee's former grade or pay band. In
        canceling the change to the lower grade or pay band, the employee is restored to the
        former grade or pay band for the period starting with the date of the downgrade. The
        change to higher grade or pay band action is effective not later than the beginning of
        the fourth pay period following the day of the decision, unless the decision specifies a
        different date.
     17.13.15.2. Nonretroactive Action. The personnel action to correct the job grading of a
     position is made nonretroactively if the:
        17.13.15.2.1. Appeal is not submitted within specified time limits.
        17.13.15.2.2. Appeal decision results in a higher grade or pay band than that held
        before the appeal, except for the situation described in paragraph 17.13.15.1.3.
        17.13.15.2.3. Appeal decision results in further downgrade.
  17.13.16. Closing and Canceling Appeal. An appeal is:
     17.13.16.1. Closed when an appellate official has rendered a decision and any required
     corrective action has been taken.
     17.13.16.2. Canceled when:
        17.13.16.2.1. The appellant submits in writing, before the appellate decision, a
        request to withdraw the appeal.
        17.13.16.2.2. When changes in the duties and responsibilities of the position being
        appealed result in a classification action prior to receipt of the appeal decision. The
        servicing NAF-HR is responsible for notifying the office processing the appeal.
        17.13.16.2.3. The employee is moved from the position or the position is abolished,
        except when there may be entitlements to retroactive benefits. This includes benefits
        allowable after the death of the employee.

          17.14.3.2.1. The employee has served for a minimum of one continuous year
          immediately before the change in one or more positions at a pay band higher than the

             schedules.
         17.14.3.2.3.4. When an employee receiving a retained rate accepts a temporary
         promotion to the same or higher pay band than that from which demoted, the
         temporary promotion does not affect the running of the pay retention period, which
         still ends two years after the original demotion.
  17.14.4. Any appeal from an employee as a result of these procedures is processed according
  to the appeal procedures in Chapter 9.
  17.14.5. On receipt of a higher headquarters final classification decision of a properly

     17.14.5.1. A statement that the action is not retroactive.
     17.14.5.2. A statement that pay retention is not authorized.
     17.14.5.3. Pay is set at the rate to which the employee would have progressed had he or
     she not been placed in the higher-graded position. To be properly documented, a
     tentatively classified position is identified on the AF Form 2545 which assigned the
     employee to the position, with the remark: "Grade (pay band) and salary shown are
     tentative and subject to upward or downward nonretroactive revision." The effective date
     of the personnel action is no later than the beginning of the pay period following the 15th
     day after the NAF-HR receives the final decision of classification.

Federal Wage System (FWS) for prevailing rate employees of the Federal government. DoDI
1400.25 and OPM Operating Manual Federal Wage System-NAF contains the policy and
procedural guidance for the administration and operation of the wage system for NAF CT
employees. This chapter supplements that guidance and also provides procedures for
administration of the NF and CY pay systems. Additional guidance for pay administration for
CY positions is in the CY Pay System Program Guidance, Chapter 19.
   18.1.1. NAF employees are paid on the basis of equal pay for work of substantially similar
   difficulty and responsibility, and overall position requirements.
   18.1.2. NAF employees employed in the U.S., its territories, or its possessions are paid at

surveys and changes to the GS result in the issuance of NAF wage rate schedules for CT
employees and NAF pay range schedules for NF and CY employees. When the minimum rate for
the band is raised in accordance with section DoDI 1400.25-V1405, employees at the bottom of
the band, who are rated at least satisfactory or equivalent, must be given a pay increase to keep
their rate of pay within the pay range for the band. Employees in a less than satisfactory or
equivalent status are ineligible for a pay increase. This means that in some cases their pay may
fall below the minimum of the band.
   18.3.1. CT wage schedules are issued as a result of locality surveys and changes to the
   federal minimum wage, or state minimum wage if higher.
   18.3.2. Pay range schedules setting the minimum and maximum rates for pay bands NFI and
   NF-II, and the minimum for NFIII, are also issued at the same time as the wage schedule for
   CT employees. The pay range schedule includes a percentage cost of living adjustment
   (COLA) for NFI and NFII employees. The adjustment shall not exceed the average
   percentage adjustment stated on the pay report attached to the current pay schedule. It shall
   not be granted if both the Employment Cost Index (ECI) adjustment and the locality
   adjustment are canceled for appropriated GS employees.
   18.3.3. Pay range schedules setting the maximum for NFIII, and the minimum and
   maximum rates for NFIV through NFVI, are issued as a result of changes to the GS. The
   COLA for NFIII through NFVI will be equal to the adjustment for GS employees, excluding
   locality. The maximum rate for NF-VI will be adjusted to equate to the rate for Level IV of
   the Executive Schedule, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. Section 5373, ―Limitation on Pay Fixed
   by Administrative Action‖. The maximum rate for NF-V will be adjusted to equate to the
   highest GS-15, step 10, locality pay rate. The maximum rates for NF-III and NF-IV will be
   adjusted to equate to 40 and 63%, respectively, of the NF-V maximum rate, rounded up to
   the nearest $500.
   18.3.4. Pay range schedules setting the minimum and maximum rates for the CY pay
   schedule must be constructed as a result of changes to the GS. The COLA for CY employees
   will be equal to the adjustment for GS employees, including the locality.
       18.3.4.1. Pay band I covers CY-01 and CY-02 positions. The minimum rate for this pay
       band is equal to the hourly rate of pay for GS-02, step 1. The maximum rate is equal to
       the hourly rate of pay for GS-03, step 10 including locality pay.
       18.3.4.2. Pay band II covers CY-03 through CY-05 positions. The minimum rate for this
       pay band is equal to the hourly rate of pay for GS-04, step 1. The maximum rate is equal
       to the hourly rate of pay for GS-05, step 10 including locality pay.
   18.3.5. For U. S. Citizens in Foreign Areas:
       18.3.5.1. CT wage schedules are issued by the DoD as a result of locality wage surveys
       and changes to the federal minimum wage. The schedules are normally issued in
       December, with a January effective date. These schedules provide pay adjustment
       guidance for NS, NL, and NA pay plan employees.
       18.3.5.2. NAF pay system schedules are issued by the DoD normally in December, with
       a January effective date. The COLA for pay bands NF-I and NF-II is determined by the
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                217


      DoD. COLAs for pay bands NF-III through NF-VI are the same as the adjustment for
      GS employees, excluding locality pay.
   18.3.6. All schedules are effective on the date shown on the schedule even if that date does
   not coincide with the beginning of a pay period.
18.4. Basic Requirements for Salary Payments.
   18.4.1. All administrative requirements must be met before an employee is entitled to pay
   for hours worked. Effective dates of job assignments, pay increases, etc., must be clearly
   established on AF Form 2545 and authenticated by the NAF-HR. The NAF-HR, to ensure
   timely payment, sends the appropriate documentation through DCPDS. Such documents
   must be received in the DCPDS by close of business on Wednesday of the second week in
   the pay period, in order to ensure payroll processing of the document in the pay period in
   which the action is effective. Documents received after that date will not be processed until
   the following pay period. Managers and supervisors must be made aware of these time
   restrictions, and must keep them in mind when hiring new employees at the end of a pay
   period. The initial pay of such employees may be delayed if the AF Form 2545 documenting
   the appointment is not processed and in DCPDS by the above cutoff date. NAF-HRs brief
   new employees hired under such circumstances of when they can expect to receive their first
   pay.
   18.4.2. Timesheets for AF Standard Timekeeping system must be supported by the AF Form
   2545 that appoints the employee to a position before payment may be made. Payment of a
   wage or salary to a person through the payroll system, for hours worked is not made for any
   period before the effective date shown on the AF Form 2545. Officially, certified timesheets
   are required for each employee before any payment or disbursement of funds is made for
   basic pay, overtime, authorized differentials, premium pay, allowances, leave, etc.
   Supporting documents (such as OPM 71, Request for Leave or Approved Absence, evidence
   of court service, and so forth) must accompany timesheets when required by this manual or
   by installation policy.
   18.4.3. A timesheet is prepared each pay period for each employee on the rolls, whether or
   not that employee is in a pay or duty status. The timesheet accounts for all guaranteed hours,
   whether worked or not.
      18.4.3.1. If an employee works less than the number of guaranteed hours because of self-
      initiated absences, the time not worked is properly recorded on the timesheet.
      18.4.3.2. When an employee with a work schedule of more hours than his or her
      guaranteed hours, is required by a supervisor to work less hours than scheduled, that
      employee's work schedule is considered as temporarily changed, no lower than the
      guaranteed hours. Leave is not charged for those hours temporarily not scheduled and
      not worked that do not go below the guaranteed hours. Timesheets for flexible
      employees with guaranteed hours of zero, show hours worked.
   18.4.4. A quarter hour is the largest fraction of an hour used for crediting irregular or
   occasional hours worked. When occasional or irregular work is performed in other than the
   full fraction, odd minutes are rounded up or rounded down to the nearest quarter hour.
   (Regular work is not scheduled in less than quarter hour increments; see paragraph 1.8.3.)

18.5. Pay Periods. Pay periods for employees are 2 weeks long and consist of two consecutive
administrative workweeks, Sunday through Saturday.
18.6. Pay for Day of Entrance on Duty. An employee is entitled to pay on an official
appointment, based on the AF Form 2545 and entrance on duty. Pay for the day of appointment
includes the time spent in completing employment in processing, provided the person reports for
duty at the work site on the first scheduled day and makes himself or herself available to perform
the duties of his or her position.
18.7. Pay for Day of Separation or Death.
   18.7.1. Full pay on the date of separation is not authorized, unless the employee is in a work
   or paid leave status for the entire day. The time spent in complying with out-processing or
   clearing of an installation is considered as duty status, but should not exceed 2 hours.
   18.7.2. Full basic pay for the day on which an employee dies is authorized if death occurred
   within the employee's scheduled tour of duty, regardless of the hour of death, and if the
   employee was in a pay status on the workday preceding the day of death.
18.8. Effective Date of Actions. Use the AF Form 2545 to document actions. Effective dates
are determined according to the following:
   18.8.1. Appointment actions are effective on the date that all requirements for the hiring
   action are completed and the individual is available for duty. This includes directed deposit
   enrollment.
   18.8.2. Change actions that affect an employee, such as promotion, reassignment, change in
   employment category, etc., are effective on the first day of the pay period after all
   requirements for the action are met.
   18.8.3. Separation actions due to death are effective at the close of business on the day of
   death. All other separation actions are effective at close of business on the employee’s last
   workday.
   18.8.4. Correction and amendment actions are effective the same date as the action being
   corrected or amended. Collection of overpayments, payment of retroactive pay, or
   retroactive accrual of leave is proper, if applicable.
   18.8.5. If two or more personnel actions that relate to one employee are effective on the
   same day, the actions are processed in the order most advantageous to the employee and on
   the same document, if possible.
   18.8.6. If personnel actions that relate to one employee are to be effective on different
   effective dates, the actions are processed separately. For example, an appointment action and
   an election of insurance coverage that have different effective dates, are processed as two
   separate actions.
   18.8.7. Revised wage schedules for CT employees are effective at the beginning of the first
   full shift on the effective date shown on the wage schedule.
   18.8.8. Revised NAF Pay Schedules for NF-I and NF-II employees are effective on the date
   shown on the NAF Pay Schedule.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 219


   18.8.9. Revised NAF Pay Schedules for NFIII through NFVI and CY employees, made as a
   result of changes to the GS, are effective on the date shown on the NAF Pay Schedule.
   18.8.10. Miscellaneous actions, e.g., name changes, change in military status, are effective
   on the date that all requirements for the action are met, and the information is presented to
   the NAF-HR.
   18.8.11. Movement between DoD NAFIs, including transfers of functions, are made on
   predetermined and agreed upon dates between the losing and gaining NAFIs. If the move
   involves a change to a NAFI serviced by another NAF-HR, dates are determined by NAF-
   HRs and NAFIs involved.
   18.8.12. Termination, expiration of appointment, and end of a temporary promotion or
   reassignment actions are effective at the close of business on the day the action occurs.
   18.8.13. WGIs are effective on the first day of the first pay period following the day the
   waiting period is completed. For example, if the WGI waiting period is completed in the
   middle of the pay period, the WGI is effective at the beginning of the next pay period. If the
   WGI waiting period is completed on the first day of a pay period, the effective date of the
   WGI is the beginning of the following pay period.
18.9. Pay Setting Procedures.
   18.9.1. New Appointment to a CT Position. All new appointments are made at the
   minimum step of the grade, unless a higher step is authorized in table 181.
   18.9.2. New Appointment to a NF or CY Position. Pay may be set at any rate within the
   applicable pay band. Consideration is given to the appointee's previous rate of pay and
   special qualifications, including skills and experience of an exceptional or highly specialized
   nature related to the position. The difficulty of filling the position is also considered.
   18.9.3. Reinstatement. Rates of pay for former regular employees, who are reinstated to
   regular positions within a NAFI within six months from separation, are made according to
   table 18.2.
   18.9.4. Promotion. The pay of an employee who is promoted to a higher grade or pay band
   in an AF NAFI at the same installation and in the same pay system is according to tables 18.3
   or 18.10.
   18.9.5. Reassignment. Rates of pay for employees who are reassigned in an AF NAFI at
   the same installation and pay system are according to tables 18.4 or 18.9.
   18.9.6. Change to a Lower Grade or Pay band. Rates of pay for employees who are
   changed to a lower grade or pay band, in an AF NAFI at the same installation and in the
   same pay system, are according to tables 18.5, 18.11, or 18.12.
   18.9.7. Transfer of Function. Rates of pay for employees who are transferred due to a
   transfer of function from one DoD NAFI to another are according to table 18.6. Usually,
   only one AF Form 2545 is required. If the gaining NAFI is not serviced by the same NAF-
   HR, the appointment document is prepared by the gaining NAF-HR official, who sends a
   copy to the losing NAF-HR before the date of separation.

      18.9.8. Change From One Pay System to Another. Terminology and rate of pay for a
      change between different types of NAF pay systems in a NAFI at the same installation are
      determined by tables 18.7 and 18.8.
      18.9.9. Change in Employment Category. The rate of pay is determined according to
      tables 18.3, 18.4, 18.5, 18.7, 18.8, 18.9, 18.10, 18.11, or 18.12, depending on whether the
      action is concurrent with a promotion, reassignment, or a change to lower grade or pay band.
   18.9.10. Application of New or Revised NAF Wage Schedules. NAF-HRs prepare
   AF Forms 2545 to affect new or revised wage schedules. AF Forms 2548s are not required
   to affect these changes.
         18.9.10.1. Effective Dates. New or revised wage schedules, as a result of a change to
         the federal or state minimum wage, or as a result of locality wage surveys, for all covered
         wage employees are effective at the beginning of the first full shift on the date specified
         on the DoD wage schedule, even though that date may not coincide with the beginning of
         a pay period.
         18.9.10.2. Applying the Schedule. On the effective date of a new or revised wage
         schedule, the scheduled rate of pay of a wage employee is initially adjusted as follows:
             18.9.10.2.1. If an employee is being paid at one of the scheduled rates of a grade
             under the old wage schedule, he or she is paid at the scheduled rate of pay for the
             corresponding numerical rate of the same grade under the new or revised wage
             schedule.
             18.9.10.2.2. If an employee is being paid at a rate in excess of the maximum
             scheduled rate of his or her grade under the old wage schedule, he or she is entitled to
             pay retention as follows:
                 18.9.10.2.2.1. CT employees who have indefinite pay entitlements, are entitled to
                 receive increases as shown in paragraph 18.13.
                 18.9.10.2.2.2. An employee is not required to suffer a hardship because of a delay
                 in applying a new pay schedule. Accordingly, a retroactive change is not made if
                 actions taken and payments made during the period of retroactivity are more
                 advantageous to the employee, than the rate of pay that results from a new
                 schedule. The Comptroller General has ruled, at 53 Comp. Gen. 665, B.140583,
                 13 Mar 74 that pay retention is not permissible when wage reductions are based
                 on decreases in prevailing rates, as determined by wage surveys. Therefore, wage
                 schedules with a decrease in rate are applied according to the effective date shown
                 on those schedules.

NOTES:
1. This table does not apply to the promotion of regular CT employees who are in grade or pay
retention, to other regular CT positions (see table 18.10).
2. This rule also applies to an employee promoted from a single-rate job under a special
schedule, to a multi-rate job under the regular schedule.
3. If promotion is to a position in the same NAFI in a different wage area, the NAF-HR
determines the employee's pay entitlement as if there were two actions (a promotion and a
reassignment) and processes them in the order that gives the employee the maximum benefit.
The employee's pay entitlement is determined as if the employee were promoted under the old
wage schedule and then reassigned to the same NAFI in the new wage area, or reassigned to the
same NAFI in the new wage area and then promoted under the new wage schedule, whichever
provides the greater benefit.
4. Upon promotion, an employee may be granted the benefit of the highest previous rate
provisions of paragraph 18.2.12, if this would result in a higher rate of pay.
5. Employees who are promoted from a regular position to a flexible position are not authorized
to retain a rate of pay above the top step of the grade.
6. Or existing scheduled rate of pay, if that rate is higher as a result of previous pay retention.

     18.9.11. Application of New or Revised NAF Pay band Schedules. NAF-HRs prepare AF

          18.9.11.1.1. New or revised pay band schedules as a result of a change to the federal
          or state minimum wage, or as a result of locality wage surveys, for all covered
          employees are effective at the beginning of the first full shift on the date specified on
          the wage schedule by DoD, even though that date may not coincide with the
          beginning of a pay period.
          18.9.11.1.2. New or revised pay band schedules as a result of legislative changes to
          the GS are effective on the first day of the first pay period on or after 1 January or the
          date specified on the schedule.
      18.9.11.2. Applying the Schedules.
          18.9.11.2.1. If, as a result of locality wage surveys, increases are made to the
          minimum and maximum rates of pay in pay bands NFI and NFII, and to the minimum
          rate of pay band NFIII, the NAF-HR initiates pay adjustments on all NFI and NFII
          employees using the average percentage increase indicated on the NAF Pay System
          Pay Report for each level. After application of this percentage, if a NFI, II, or III
          employee's pay is below the minimum for the pay band, an adjustment is initiated by
          the NAF-HR to ensure that no employee assigned to a pay band receives less than the
          minimum for the applicable pay band.
          18.9.11.2.2. If, as a result of legislative changes to the GS, increases are made to the
          maximum rate of pay for pay band NFIII and to both the minimum and maximum
          rates of pay for pay bands NFIV through NFVI, the NAF-HR initiates pay
          adjustments on all NFIII through NFVI employees using the percentage of the annual
          legislative pay increase (excluding locality). After application of this percentage, if a
          NFIV, V, or VI employee's pay is below the minimum for the pay band, an
          adjustment is initiated by the NAF-HR to insure that no employee assigned to a pay
          band receives less than the minimum pay for the applicable pay band.
          18.9.11.2.3. Legislative changes to the GS locality schedule are applied to the
          minimum and maximum rates of pay for both pay bands on the CY schedule. In
          foreign areas, the minimum and maximum rates for each of the two pay bands for CY
          employees will be adjusted in accordance with the nationwide GS that does not
          include locality pay. CY employees whose pay is then below the minimum of the
          adjusted pay band for their position, have their pay adjusted by the NAF-HR to bring
          them within the band. Adjustments made to employees already within the pay band
          require completion of an AF Form 2548 with appropriate approval.
   18.9.12. Reappointments. The pay rate for an employee who is reappointed (not
   reinstatement) to a NAFI in which previously employed within 1 year after separation, is
   made according to table 18.1. When a CT employee is reappointed to a position at the same
   or lower grade, service in a pay status in the former position since the last equivalent increase
   (see paragraph 18.11.6) is creditable towards the employee's next WGI. This creditable
   service may result in an employee being appointed and immediately being entitled to the next
   step in the grade. Credit may be given for no more than one step, regardless of the amount of
   creditable service involved since the last equivalent increase. A new waiting period begins
   upon receiving an equivalent increase (see paragraph 18.11.2).
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 235


18.10. Special Pay Rates. If prevailing rates of pay for specific types of NAF jobs are so
substantially above the maximum rates of NAF wage/pay schedules that recruiting and retaining
well-qualified individuals are greatly hampered, HQ USAF/A1S may recommend that a special
rate of pay be set up, with the approval of the DoD, and in the case of CT positions, the approval
of the OPM. In exceptional cases, the installation commander may request that special rates or
rate ranges be set up for specialized occupations that are critical to the mission of a NAFI. The
request must be sent through command channels to HQ AFSVA/SVXH (see table 18.13).
Requests are made only when these conditions exist:
   18.10.1. Rates of pay on the authorized NAF regular schedules are not adequate for
   recruiting and retaining qualified employees.
   18.10.2. Authorizing increased minimum rates for these occupations in table 18.13 did not
   solve the problem.
18.11. WGIs.
   18.11.1. Waiting Period. A CT employee whose performance is satisfactory is advanced to
   the next higher step of his or her grade following completion of the waiting period required
   by tables 18.14 and 18.15, provided the employee did not receive an equivalent increase in
   pay during the waiting period. A NAF employee's performance is satisfactory when he or
   she maintains a performance rating of satisfactory or better during the rating period.
   18.11.2. Beginning of a New Waiting Period. A new waiting period begins:
       18.11.2.1. On the first day of a new appointment to a NAFI, except in the case of a
       transfer of function from another DoD NAFI, or reinstatement of a former AF NAF
       employee.
       18.11.2.2. On the first day of a new appointment to a NAFI in which previously
       employed, after a break in service of more than 52 calendar weeks.
       18.11.2.3. Upon receiving an equivalent increase (see paragraph 18.11.5).
   18.11.3. Duration of Waiting Periods. Tables 18.14 and 18.15 specify the waiting period
   an employee must serve before advancing to the next step of his or her grade.
       18.11.3.1. A change to lower grade of any employee does not affect the beginning date
       of a waiting period. The waiting period is not interrupted by non-workdays intervening
       between an employee's last regularly scheduled workday in one job and his or her first
       regularly scheduled workday in a new job in a NAFI.
       18.11.3.2. Use Attachment 14 in computing waiting periods and effective dates for
       WGIs. Any LWOP hours are used to adjust the waiting period and subsequent due date
       as outlined in table 18.14.
   18.11.4. Creditable Service.      Creditable service for WGIs is continuous civilian NAF
   employment, and includes:
       18.11.4.1. All service in a pay status, including periods of sick leave, annual leave,
       advanced sick leave, and advanced annual leave or other paid leave.
236                                                       AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


         18.11.4.2. A limited amount of time in a nonpay status, as shown in table 18.14.
         (Nonpay status in excess of that amount is made up with creditable service before the
         next WGI is effected.)
         18.11.4.3. A leave of absence granted a regular employee to serve with the Armed
         Forces during a period of war or National emergency, if the employee is reemployed with
         the same AF NAFI no later than 52 calendar weeks after separation from active military
         duty. It is also granted if the employee is restored to his or her position after separation
         from active military duty or hospitalization continuing thereafter, as explained in
         paragraph 3.17.
         18.11.4.4. LWOP granted to an employee because of an injury for which compensation
         is payable under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.
         18.11.4.5. Service before a single nonpay period, if the nonpay period is less than 52
         calendar weeks.
         18.11.4.6. Service before a break in service in any NAFI of less than 52 weeks,
         regardless of employment category, when the employee is brought back to the same or
         lower grade position.
      18.11.5. Equivalent Increase.
         18.11.5.1. Except as provided in paragraph 18.11.6, an equivalent increase is an increase
         or increases in an employee's rate of basic pay equal to or greater than the difference
         between the rate of pay for the grade and step occupied by the employee and the rate of
         pay for the next higher step of that grade. In the case of a promotion, the grade and step
         occupied means the grade and step to which promoted.

NOTES:
1. Any day on which service is performed constitutes a full workday of credit. (Only the days
on which service is performed are counted.)

2. If crediting flexible service to regular category employment, 5 workdays equate to one
calendar week. However, care must be taken to ensure that the service credited is not more than
the calendar time for the period involved.

         18.11.5.2. If an employee has served in more than one grade during the waiting period
         under consideration and it is necessary to determine whether he or she received an
         equivalent increase in a prior grade, an equivalent increase is one or more increases in the
         scheduled rate of pay, equal to or greater than the amount of the WGI for advancement
         between steps of the prior grade.
         18.11.5.3. If an employee receives more than one increase in his or her scheduled rate of
         pay during the waiting period under consideration, no one of which is an equivalent
         increase, the first and subsequent increases are added until they amount to an equivalent
         increase, at which time he or she is considered to have received an equivalent increase.
      18.11.6. Increases Not Counted as Equivalent Increases:
         18.11.6.1. The application of a new or revised wage schedule.
         18.11.6.2. The payment of additional compensation as nonforeign or foreign post
         differentials, or nonforeign COLAs.
         18.11.6.3. The payment of premium pay for overtime and holiday pay.
         18.11.6.4. The payment of nightshift differential.
         18.11.6.5. The payment of hazard pay differentials.
         18.11.6.6. The payment of rates above the minimum rate of the grade, in recognition of
         specific qualifications, or in jobs in specific hard-to-fill occupations.
         18.11.6.7. The correction of an error in a previous demotion or reduction in pay.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              239


     18.11.6.8. A temporary limited promotion (that is, a promotion known in advance to be
     temporary) that is later changed back to the former grade or a different lower grade.
     18.11.6.9. A transfer or reassignment in the same grade and step (rate) within the same
     NAFI to another local wage area that has a higher wage schedule.
     18.11.6.10. The repromotion to a former or intervening grade of any NAF employee
     whose earlier change to a lower grade was not for cause and was not at the employee's
     request.
     18.11.6.11. If an employee is changed from a non-wage job to a wage job, the
     determination of whether the change resulted in an equivalent increase is made by
     comparing the employee's new scheduled rate of pay with 104% of the representative rate
     of the wage grade from which changed.
     18.11.6.12. If an employee is changed from one wage job to another wage job that is
     subject to a different wage schedule (such as from supervisory to nonsupervisory or vice
     versa), the determination of whether the change resulted in an equivalent increase is made
     by comparing the increase received, if any, with 104% of the representative rate of the
     grade from which changed.
  18.11.7. Effective Date.
     18.11.7.1. The effective date of a WGI is the first day of the first pay period after the
     required waiting period is completed. Example: If the WGI due date is 14 Dec 2008, the
     effective date of the WGI is the first pay period following this date, which is 21 Dec
     2008. If the WGI due date falls on the beginning of a pay period the effective date of the
     WGI is the beginning of the next pay period.
     18.11.7.2. If an employee has been in a nonpay status during the waiting period, except
     as covered in paragraphs 18.11.3 and 18.11.4, his or her WGI is effective on the first day
     of the first pay period after the employee has made up any nonpay time in excess of that
     allowed in table 18.14.
         18.11.7.2.1. Before preparing the AF Form 2545, the NAF-HR reviews the LWOP
         hours to ensure that the employee has not exceeded the number of LWOP weeks
         allowable under Table 18.14.
         18.11.7.2.2. The NAF-HR computes the excess nonpay time, which must be made up
         before the WGI can be effected, by:
            18.11.7.2.2.1. Determining the average number of weekly scheduled hours, by
            dividing the total number of scheduled hours during the waiting period by the
            number of weeks in the waiting period.
            18.11.7.2.2.2. Determining the number of weeks in a nonpay status, by dividing
            the total number of hours in a nonpay status by the number of hours in the
            employee's average weekly work schedule.
            18.11.7.2.2.3. Determining the number of calendar weeks to be made up, by
            subtracting the number of weeks allowed in the waiting period from the total
            number of weeks in a nonpay status.
            18.11.7.2.2.4. Computing the new due date, by extending the waiting period by
240                                                     AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


              the number of calendar weeks that must be made up. The new date is the
              beginning of the first pay period following the date the adjusted waiting period is
              completed.
          18.11.7.2.3. The NAF-HR prepares AF Form 2545 and approves the action.
      18.11.7.3. When the effective date of a WGI and the effective date of another personnel
      action are the same, actions are processed in the order most advantageous to the
      employee.
   18.11.8. Corrective Actions. A WGI is corrected if the WGI is delayed beyond its proper
   effective date or granted before its proper effective date because of administrative oversight,
   error, or delay. The increase is made effective as of the date it was properly due, with the
   proper increase paid retroactively, or overpayment of wages recouped.
18.12. Pay Retention. Pay retention covers regular NF or CY employees moving within the
pay band system, regular NF or CY employees moving to regular CT positions, and regular CT
employees moving to regular NF or CY positions.
   18.12.1. Eligibility for Pay Retention. Eligibility for pay retention occurs when, as a result
   of a classification error, a regular employee is downgraded within the NAFI to another
   regular position. The employee is entitled to a retained rate of pay for 2 years if the
   employee has served one continuous year immediately before the change in one or more
   positions at a higher pay band or grade.
   18.12.2. Duration of Pay Retention:
      18.12.2.1. Pay is retained under this policy for 2 years, unless it is terminated earlier by
      one of the following conditions:
          18.12.2.1.1. A break in service of one or more work days.
          18.12.2.1.2. A later change to a lower pay band or grade which is effected for
          personal reasons at the employee's request, personal cause, or a BBA resulting from a
          validated lack of funds or curtailment of work.
          18.12.2.1.3. Entitlement to a rate of pay that is equal to or higher than the retained
          rate because of another personnel action or normal operation of the pay system.
          18.12.2.1.4. Change to a flexible category.
      18.12.2.2. If an employee receiving a retained rate accepts a temporary promotion to the
      same or higher pay band or grade than that from which demoted, the temporary
      promotion does not affect the running of the pay retention period, which still ends 2 years
      after the original demotion.
   18.12.3. Amount of Retained Rate. The retained rate is the lesser of the scheduled rate of
   pay immediately before the change or 150% of the maximum rate of the pay band or grade to
   which demoted.
   18.12.4. Effect of Further Demotion. If an employee receiving a retained rate is further
   demoted during the 2-year retention period, he or she continues to receive the same retained
   rate until termination of eligibility occurs.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 241


   18.12.5. Entitlement to Future Wage or Pay Schedule Increases During the 2Year
   Retention Period. An employee whose pay is retained under the above procedures is
   entitled to any increase provided in the scheduled step rate of the grade from which demoted,
   or any increase provided in the pay band from which demoted.
   18.12.6. Adjustment of Rate of Pay After the Pay Retention Period Terminates or
   Expires. If a retained rate is terminated because the pay retention period expires, the
   employee's rate of pay is adjusted to the top step of the new grade, or to the maximum rate of
   the new pay band.
18.13. Grade and Pay Retention for CT Employees.
   18.13.1. Definitions. For the purpose of this paragraph:
      18.13.1.1. Employee means an employee occupying a regular CT position who is moved
      to a lower grade regular CT position, in a NAFI, for those reasons explained in this
      paragraph.
      18.13.1.2. Retained grade means the grade used in determining benefits to which the
      employee is entitled.
      18.13.1.3. Covered Pay Schedule means the NAF CT wage schedule.
      18.13.1.4. Position subject to this paragraph means any regular NAF CT position in a
      NAFI.
      18.13.1.5. BBA procedures means those procedures applied in carrying out any BBA.
   18.13.2. Grade Retention Following a Change of Position or Reclassification:
      18.13.2.1. BBA. Any regular NAF CT employee who, as a result of BBA procedures, is
      placed in a lower-graded regular NAF CT position, in a NAFI, is entitled, to the extent
      provided in paragraph 18.13.2.3 to retain the grade of the position held immediately
      before such placement for the 2year period beginning on the day of such placement, if he
      or she has served for 52 consecutive weeks in one or more regular CT positions in the
      NAFI at a higher grade.
      18.13.2.2. Reclassification. Any employee in a regular NAF CT position whose
      position has been reduced to a lower-graded regular CT position in the same NAFI is
      entitled, to the extent provided in paragraph 18.13.2.3 to retain the grade of such position
      before reduction for the 2-year period beginning on the date of reduction in grade, if the
      grade of the position, before reduction, had been classified at the higher grade for a
      continuous period of at least 1 year immediately before such reduction.
      18.13.2.3. For the 2year period referred to in paragraphs 18.13.2.1 and 18.13.2.2, the
      retained grade is treated as the grade of the employee's position for most purposes
      (including pay administration, retirement and life insurance, and eligibility for training
      and promotion), except:
          18.13.2.3.1. For determining whether an employee has been demoted for purposes of
          terminating grade or pay retention.
          18.13.2.3.2. For determining an employee's "exempt or nonexempt" status under
          FLSA.

         18.13.2.3.3. For those purposes of applying any BBA procedures.
      18.13.2.4. The employee is entitled to 100% of each comparable increase for his or her
      step in the retained grade.
      18.13.2.5. The 2year grade retention provisions of paragraphs 18.13.2.1 through
      18.13.2.4 cease to apply to an employee who:
         18.13.2.5.1. Has a break in service of one workday or more from the NAFI.
         18.13.2.5.2. Is demoted (determined without regard to this paragraph) for personal
         cause or at the employee's request.
         18.13.2.5.3. Is placed in, or declines a reasonable offer of, a position with a grade
         equal to or higher than the retained grade.
         18.13.2.5.4. Elects in writing to have the benefits of this paragraph terminated.
   18.13.3. Pay Retention.
      18.13.3.1. Pay retention is granted to any eligible employee whose rate of pay would
      otherwise be reduced only as a result of one of the following actions, if the action is not
      at the employee's request, or for personal cause, or as a result of the termination or
      expiration of a temporary promotion:
         18.13.3.1.1. Expiration of the 2year period of grade retention.
         18.13.3.1.2. BBA or reclassification when the employee does not meet eligibility
         requirements for grade retention.
         18.13.3.1.3. The reduction or elimination of special schedules or special rates.
         18.13.3.1.4. Placement in a different pay schedule in a NAFI; or in a different wage
         area when the employee moves as a part of the same NAFI or in a transfer of
         function.
         18.13.3.1.5. Placement from a special rate position to a nonspecial rate position or to
         a lower special rate position in a NAFI.
      18.13.3.2. The employee is entitled to the lowest scheduled rate of pay in the employee's
      grade, after the action is taken, which equals or exceeds his or her current scheduled rate
      of pay. If there is no such rate, the employee is entitled to the lower of:
         18.13.3.2.1. His or her scheduled rate of pay payable to the employee immediately
         before the reduction in pay; or
         18.13.3.2.2. 150% of the maximum scheduled rate of pay for the employee's new
         grade.
      18.13.3.3. The employee in retained pay is entitled to 50% of the amount of each
      increase in the maximum scheduled rate of pay, payable for his or her grade. This
      adjustment is made before a comparison with the maximum step of the grade (to decide
      whether or not the employee goes off his or her retained pay). If, after the adjustment,
      the employee's rate is less than the maximum rate of his or her grade, the employee is
      entitled to the maximum rate.
      18.13.3.4. The preceding provisions cease to apply to an employee who:
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                243


         18.13.3.4.1. Has a break in service of one workday or more from the NAFI.
         18.13.3.4.2. Declines a reasonable offer of a position with a scheduled rate of pay
         equal to or higher than, the retained rate of pay.
         18.13.3.4.3. Is demoted for personal cause or at the employee's request.
         18.13.3.4.4. Is changed to a flexible position.
         18.13.3.4.5. Is entitled to a scheduled rate of pay which is equal to or higher than
         retained rate of pay.
  18.13.4. Grade Retention When a Transfer of Function is Accepted. An employee who
  accepts a transfer of function has full grade and pay retention, if otherwise entitled.
  18.13.5. Exclusion of Flexible Employment.
     18.13.5.1. Grade and pay retention is limited to those employees whose employment
     category is regular.
     18.13.5.2. Any employee serving under a temporary promotion or temporary
     reassignment is considered to be employed on a temporary basis, as to the grade of the
     position temporarily occupied. Therefore, such an employee may not receive grade
     retention, based on the grade held during the temporary promotion. Also, neither grade
     nor pay retention is terminated due to a temporary promotion or temporary reassignment
     during the grade retention period. A temporary promotion is defined to be a promotion,
     with a definite time limitation, that the employee was informed, in advance, was
     temporary and would require the employee to return to his or her former grade at the end
     of the temporary promotion.
  18.13.6. Movement Between NS, NL, and NA Schedules. When an employee is moved,
  with or without his or her position, from an NS to NL, NS to NA, or NL to NA pay schedule,
  under circumstances that would entitle the employee to grade retention, it must be
  determined whether a reduction in grade has occurred, and accordingly, whether grade
  retention is warranted.
     18.13.6.1. To do this, the representative rate of the employee's position must be
     determined before and after the movement. The representative rate of a position under a
     regular prevailing rate FWS wage schedule, is the second step of the grade.
     18.13.6.2. If the representative rate of the employee's position after movement is lower
     than before the movement, the movement has been to a lower grade, and the employee is
     entitled to grade retention, if otherwise eligible.
  18.13.7. Further Reductions in Grade.
     18.13.7.1. If, during a 2year period of grade retention an employee is further reduced in
     grade, under circumstances also entitling the employee to grade retention, the employee
     will continue to retain the previous retained grade for the remainder of the original 2-year
     grade retention period. At the end of that period, the employee is entitled to retain the
     grade of the position from which the further reduction in grade was made until 2 years
     have passed from the date of the further reduction in grade.
244                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


         18.13.7.2. During the second 2year period, but before it expires, the employee is paid as
         if the second reduction had not occurred. The employee's rate of scheduled pay is fixed
         according to paragraph 18.13.11, either at a rate of the rate range for the grade to which
         the employee was previously reduced, or in a retained rate of scheduled pay computed as
         if the further reduction had not occurred. At the end of the second 2year period, the
         employee's rate of scheduled pay is again fixed according to paragraph 18.13.11, at either
         a rate of the rate range for the grade to which the employee was reduced in the second
         reduction or at a retained rate of scheduled pay, computed on the basis of the grade to
         which the employee was reduced by the second reduction in grade.
         18.13.7.3. If, during a period of pay retention, an employee is placed in another position
         under circumstances also entitling the employee to pay retention, the employee's prior
         entitlement continues unaffected. The employee's retained pay is NOT reduced by virtue
         of the later action by applying the 150% limitation discussed in paragraph 18.13.3.
      18.13.8. Demotion for Personal Cause or at an Employee's Request.
         18.13.8.1. Grade and pay retention do not apply to an employee who is reduced in grade
         for personal cause or at his or her own request.
         18.13.8.2. A demotion for personal cause is an adverse action based on the conduct,
         character, or unacceptable performance of an employee.
         18.13.8.3. A demotion is considered to be at an employee's request if the demotion is
         initiated by the employee for his or her benefit, convenience, or personal advantage, or
         when the employee requests or consents to a demotion instead of a proposed adverse
         action for personal cause.
      18.13.9. Declining a Reasonable Offer of a Position. Grade and pay retention do not apply
      to an employee who declines a reasonable offer of a position, when the grade is equal to or
      higher than the employee's retained grade; or when the rate of scheduled pay is equal to or
      higher than the employee's retained pay. The termination of grade or pay retention is
      effective on the last day of the pay period in which the declination is received. To apply
      these provisions, a reasonable offer of a position must meet these conditions:
         18.13.9.1. The offer must be in writing, and must include an official PD of the offered
         position.
         18.13.9.2. The offered position must be a CT position and one for which the employee
         meets the established qualification requirements.
         18.13.9.3. The offered position must be in a NAFI, but not necessarily in the same one in
         which the employee is serving at the time of the offer.
         18.13.9.4. The offered position must be a regular position and have guaranteed hours of
         no less than the position held before the offer.
         18.13.9.5. The offered position must be in the same commuting area as the employee's
         position immediately before the offer.
         18.13.9.6. The offer must inform the employee that the entitlement to grade or pay
         retention terminates if the offer is declined and that the employee may appeal the
         termination of the grade or pay retention.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  245


  18.13.10. Effective Date of Employee's Election to Terminate Grade Retention. Grade
  retention terminates on the last day of the pay period in which the employee's written election
  is received in the NAF-HR.
  18.13.11. Determination of Rate of Scheduled Pay.
     18.13.11.1. When an employee becomes eligible for pay retention at the end of the 2year
     period of grade retention, or otherwise becomes eligible for pay retention under this
     paragraph, the NAF-HR takes one of the following actions:
         18.13.11.1.1. If the employee's rate of scheduled pay immediately before the
         eligibility for pay retention is less than the minimum rate of the grade of the position
         to be occupied, the employee is placed at the minimum rate, and pay retention does
         not apply.
         18.13.11.1.2. If the employee's rate of scheduled pay immediately before the
         eligibility for pay retention is equal to one of the rates of the grade of the position to
         be occupied, the employee is placed at that rate, and pay retention does not apply.
         18.13.11.1.3. If the employee's rate of scheduled pay immediately before eligibility
         for pay retention falls between two consecutive rates of the grade or the position to be
         occupied, the employee is placed in the higher of the two rates, and pay retention
         does not apply.
         18.13.11.1.4. If the employee's rate of scheduled pay immediately before eligibility
         for pay retention exceeds the maximum rate of the grade of the position to be
         occupied, the NAF-HR determines the employee's retained pay according to
         paragraph 18.13.3.2. This rate is subject to further adjustment according to paragraph
         18.13.3.3. When the maximum rate of the grade becomes equal to or exceeds the
         employee's retained rate of scheduled pay, the employee is placed in that maximum
         rate, and pay retention does not apply.
     18.13.11.2. In computing increases in retained rate of scheduled pay under paragraph
     18.13.3, rates are rounded to the nearest cent, counting onehalf cent and over as a whole
     cent.
  18.13.12. Issuance of Employee Memorandum. The servicing NAF-HR gives the
  employee, along with a copy of the AF Form 2545 documenting entitlement to grade
  retention, a memorandum explaining the action and the nature of the grade retention
  entitlement.
  18.13.13. Documentation of Action. Refer to the following attachments for employee
  actions and documentation requirements:
     18.13.13.1. Attachment 3, Personnel Action Codes and NOAs for AF Form 2545.
     18.13.13.2. Attachment 15, AF Form 2545, Documentation of Grade and Pay Retention
     Actions for CT Employees.
     18.13.13.3. Attachment 16, Sample Memorandum for Covered NAF CT Employees
     Eligible for Grade Retention.

18.14. Overtime Pay. Employees are entitled to be compensated for overtime work performed
within an activity as prescribed by the following paragraphs. Refer to paragraph 18.15 for
compensatory time guidance.
   18.14.1. Overtime Pay Basic Information.
         18.14.1.1. If management determines there is a need for overtime work, proper direction
         and approval of funds takes place before work is performed.
         18.14.1.2. A quarter hour is the smallest fraction of an hour used for crediting irregular
         or occasional overtime hours worked. When irregular or occasional overtime work is
         performed in other than the full fraction, odd minutes are rounded up or rounded down to
         the nearest quarter hour.
         18.14.1.3. How a position is classified determines overtime entitlement, and how
         overtime is paid. Positions are classified as either exempt or nonexempt under the FLSA.
         The NAF-HR designates and annotates the FLSA exempt or nonexempt status of all
         positions on the PD, PG and AF Forms 2545.
         18.14.1.4. Overtime for work performed on Sundays or holidays is paid in the same
         manner and at the same rate as for overtime performed on any other day.
         18.14.1.5. A regularly scheduled employee who performs irregular or occasional
         overtime work on a day when work was not scheduled, or for which the employee is
         officially required to return to his or her place of employment, is considered to have
         worked at least 2 hours for the purpose of overtime pay, whether or not work is
         performed.
      18.14.2. CT Employees (See table 18 16 and Attachment 17).
         18.14.2.1. Nonexempt CT Employees Employed in a Nonforeign Area:
            18.14.2.1.1. Are entitled to be paid overtime for hours worked in excess of 40 hours
            of work actually performed in the workweek, when ordered, directed, required,
            approved, or suffered or permitted to work the overtime.
            18.14.2.1.2. Are also entitled to be paid overtime for work performed in excess of 8
            hours in a day or in excess of 40 hours in a scheduled workweek. Under this rule, the
            employee's absence from duty on any type of paid absence, such as annual or sick
            leave, holiday leave, court leave, etc., is deemed employment and does not reduce the
            amount of overtime pay to which the employee is entitled.
         18.14.2.2. Exempt CT Employees Employed in a Nonforeign Area and CT
         Employees Employed in a Foreign Area. These employees are entitled to be paid
         overtime for hours worked in excess of 8 hours in a day or in excess of 40 hours in a
         scheduled workweek when officially ordered or approved to work the overtime hours.
         Under this rule, the employee's absence from duty on any type of paid absence, such as
         annual or sick leave, holiday leave, court leave, etc., is deemed employment and does not
         reduce the amount of overtime pay to which the employee is entitled.
         18.14.2.3. Overtime Pay for CT Employees in Dual Employment positions. Under
         the Dual Compensation Act, overtime entitlement for a CT employee is applicable as
         hours in excess of 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in a week if hours are earned in one
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   247


       position. Each position is treated as separate employment. An employee is entitled to
       overtime only if he or she worked overtime in one of the positions, in which case, he or
       she is paid at the overtime rate of the position in which the overtime was worked.
Example 1: In one week, employee works 42 hours in the NA-03 position and 5 hours in the
NA-05 position. Employee is paid for 40 hours at the NA-03 basic rate and 2 hours at the NA-03
overtime rate. The Dual Compensation Act prohibits payment for the other 5 hours in the NA-05
position.

Example 2: In one day, employee works 10 hours in the NA-03 position and 3 hours in the NA-
05 position. Employee is paid for 8 hours at the NA-03 basic rate and 2 hours at the NA-03
overtime rate. In addition, employee is paid 3 hours at the NA-05 basic rate. At the end of the
week, all hours combined in both positions cannot be more than 40 hours.

Example 3: In one day, employee works 5 hours in the NA-03 position and 5 hours in the
NA-05 position. Employee is paid for 5 hours at the NA-03 basic rate and 5 hours at the NA-05
basic rate. There is no overtime entitlement for that day.
   18.14.3. NF and CY Employees (See table 18 17 and Attachment 18).
       18.14.3.1. Nonexempt NF and CY Employees Employed in a Nonforeign Area.
       These employees are entitled to be paid overtime for hours worked in excess of 40 hours
       of work actually performed in the workweek, when ordered, directed, required, approved,
       or suffered or permitted to work the overtime. Excused absences from duty with pay,
       such as annual or sick leave, holiday leave, court leave, etc., are not periods of work, and
       are not included in the hours worked for determination of overtime entitlement. The
       overtime hourly rate of pay is one and onehalf times the employee's hourly rate of basic
       pay exclusive of any premiums or differentials.
       18.14.3.2. Exempt NF and CY Employees Employed in a Nonforeign Area and NF
       and CY Employees Employed in a Foreign Area. These employees are entitled to be
       paid for overtime for hours worked in excess of 40 hours of work actually performed in
       the workweek, only when the overtime is specifically ordered, directed, required, or
       approved in advance. Excused absences from duty with pay, such as annual or sick
       leave, holiday leave, court leave, etc., are not periods of work, and are not included in the
       hours worked for determination of overtime entitlement.
           18.14.3.2.1. Overtime Rate of Pay.
              18.14.3.2.1.1. For the exempt NF or CY employee whose rate of basic pay does
              not exceed the minimum rate for GS-10, the overtime hourly rate of pay is one
              and one-half times the employee's hourly rate of basic pay.
              18.14.3.2.1.2. For the exempt NF or CY employee whose rate of basic pay
              exceeds the minimum rate for GS-10, the overtime hourly rate of pay is one and
              one-half times the hourly rate of basic pay at the minimum rate for GS-10.

18.15. Compensatory Time.
   18.15.1. Compensatory Time for Overtime Work.
      18.15.1.1. The individual who approves compensatory time off for overtime work is the
      same individual who is authorized to order or approve overtime work for overtime
      payment that is made.
      18.15.1.2. Compensatory time off in place of overtime pay is authorized only if the
      overtime work has been officially ordered or approved. It is granted at the rate of one-
      quarter hour off for each onequarter hour of overtime worked, according to the following:
         18.15.1.2.1. An employee may not accumulate more than 60 hours of compensatory
         time.
         18.15.1.2.2. An employee with compensatory time credited takes such time off
         before annual leave is granted.
         18.15.1.2.3. Compensatory time accrued and taken is recorded on the official
         timesheet.
   18.15.2. Compensatory Time Off for Religious Observance. All employees are eligible
   for compensatory time off in place of overtime pay for religious observance:
      18.15.2.1. An employee may request to work compensatory overtime, so that time off
      may be taken without charge to leave, when personal religious belief requires that the
      employee abstain from working during certain periods of the workday or workweek.
      18.15.2.2. An employee who elects to work compensatory overtime for this purpose is
      granted, instead of overtime pay, an amount of time off from his or her scheduled work
      (hour for hour) equal to the compensatory time worked.
      18.15.2.3. An employee's request to work compensatory overtime or to take
      compensatory time off to meet his or her religious obligations may be disapproved by
      management, if such modification in work schedules interferes with the efficient
      accomplishment of the assigned mission.
   18.15.3. Compensatory Time for the Nonexempt Nonforeign Area and Foreign Area
   Employees.
      18.15.3.1. Nonexempt CT Nonforeign and All Foreign Area CT Employees.
      Compensatory time off is authorized (5 USC 5543 as amended by Section 1610 of Public
      Law 104-201, FY97 Defense Authorization, in addition to compensatory time off
      provided by 5 U.S.C 6123(a)(1). Compensatory time off must be used by the end of the
      26th pay period after that in which it was earned or be paid at the overtime rate at which
      it was earned if not used within established time period.
      18.15.3.2. Nonexempt Nonforeign NFI, NFII, and CY Employee and All Foreign
      Area NF-I, NF-II, and CY Employees. Compensatory time off is not authorized (5
      U.S.C. 5543 does not apply) except as it may be applied to those on flexible work
      schedule per 5 U.S.C. 6123(a)(1).
   18.15.4. Compensatory Time for the Nonexempt Nonforeign Area NFIII Through
   NFVI Employee. Compensatory time off may be granted under the following conditions:
250                                                        AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


         18.15.4.1. Religious observance as provided for in paragraph 18.15.2.
         18.15.4.2. An employee may request compensatory time off from a scheduled tour of
         duty sometime during the remainder of the same workweek in which the overtime was
         worked. This entitlement arises when an employee works in excess of 40 hours of work
         before the end of his or her scheduled weekly tour of duty. If circumstances then prevent
         the employee from taking the requested compensatory time off during the same week,
         payment for the overtime worked is made.
   18.15.5. Compensatory Time for the Exempt Nonforeign Area, CT, NFIII Through
   NFVI and CY Employee; and All Foreign Area NF-III Through NF-VI Employees.
   Compensatory time off may be granted under the following conditions:
         18.15.5.1. Religious observance as provided for in paragraph 18.15.2.
         18.15.5.2. An employee whose rate of basic pay is equal to or less than the maximum
         rate of basic pay for GS10, Step 10, may, upon the request of the employee, be granted
         compensatory time off from his or her tour of duty instead of payment for an equal
         amount of irregular or occasional overtime work.
             18.15.5.2.1. Employees who are granted compensatory time off in place of overtime
             pay, usually schedule the time off before the close of the pay period following the one
             during which the overtime was worked. When it is not possible to grant the time off
             by the end of that pay period, the time off is scheduled for not later than the end of the
             26th pay period after the one in which the overtime was worked.
             18.15.5.2.2. The employee who fails to take compensatory time off to which he or
             she is entitled, before the fixed time limit expires, loses his right both to
             compensatory time off and to overtime pay unless his failure is due to an exigency of
             the NAFI beyond his or her control.
             18.15.5.2.3. In the event of failure to take compensatory time off because
             management was unable to grant the employee the time off, payment for the overtime
             is made at the end of the fixed time limit.
         18.15.5.3. An employee whose rate of basic pay exceeds the maximum rate for GS10,
         Step 10, may be directed to take an equivalent amount of compensatory time off from his
         or her scheduled workweek for irregular or occasional overtime work. The compensatory
         time is granted in accordance with paragraphs 18.15.5.2.1, 18.15.5.2.2, and 18.15.5.2.3.
      18.15.6. Compensatory Time off for Travel. Section 1111 of the National Defense
      Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2008 (FY08) allowed NAF employees, white
      collar and prevailing rate, to receive compensatory time for travel. Supervisors and
      managers delegated the authority to direct travel and approve leave have the authority to
      credit and approve the usage of compensatory time off for travel. Title 5, U.S.C. chapter 55
      establishes a form of compensatory time off for time spent by an employee in a travel status
      away from the employee’s official duty station when such time is not otherwise
      compensable. Compensatory time off for travel will not convert to overtime pay, and will
      not be paid out as a lump-sum payment.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               251


     18.15.6.1. Unless specifically excluded by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5541(2), all DoD
     employees who have a regular tour of duty for leave purposes are eligible to earn and use
     compensatory time off for travel.
     18.15.6.2. Official travel shall be scheduled to occur during an employee's tour of duty,
     consistent with mission requirements. Only in cases where this is not practicable will
     employees earn entitlement to compensatory time off for travel.
     18.15.6.3. Procedures for Crediting Compensatory Time Off for Travel
        18.15.6.3.1. An eligible employee who performs official travel may request
        compensatory time off for time spent in a travel status away from the official duty
        station if the travel time is not otherwise compensable as defined in 5 CFR 550.1403.
        18.15.6.3.2. An employee shall request credit for compensatory time off for travel by
        providing documentation of the time that he/she spent in an official travel status,
        including any meal periods.
        18.15.6.3.3. Within five workdays after returning to the official duty station, the
        employee must submit his/her travel itinerary, or any other documentation acceptable
        to the employee's supervisor, in support of the request. Credit will be in increments of
        one-quarter of an hour (15 minutes).
        18.15.6.3.4. Supervisors and managers otherwise authorized to direct travel or
        approve time and attendance may approve employee requests for crediting
        compensatory time off for travel under the provisions of 5 CFR 550.1404-1405 and
        DoD Civilian Personnel Management Service (CPMS) memorandum, Compensatory
        Time off for Travel for NAF Prevailing Rate Employees dated June 17, 2008.
        18.15.6.3.5. For every 8½ hours of creditable compensatory time off claimed by the
        employee, the supervisor will deduct ½ hour as a bona fide meal period. The only
        exception is a situation in which the employee is continuously traveling in a
        conveyance (aircraft, train, automobile); in this situation, the automatic deduction of
        ½ hour does not apply. Apart from the automatic deduction, any meal period reported
        by an employee will be deducted from creditable time.
        18.15.6.3.6. Other determinations regarding what time is creditable for employees in
        a travel status will be at the discretion of the supervisor within the regulatory limits
        described in 5 CFR 550.1404. Once the supervisor has approved the employee's
        request, the appropriate timekeeper will credit the employee with earned
        compensatory time off for travel.
  18.15.7. Procedures for Using Compensatory Time Off for Travel
     18.15.7.1. An employee must request permission from his or her supervisor to schedule
     the use of accrued compensatory time off. The employee may submit his or her request
     on OPM Form 71, Request for Leave or Approved Absence, or in accordance with any
     other established guidelines.
     18.15.7.2. Once the supervisor has approved the employee's request for use of
     compensatory time off for travel, the appropriate timekeeper will charge the employee for
     its use through normal time and attendance procedures.
252                                                       AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      18.15.8. Accountability. Managers and supervisors are responsible for the appropriate use
      of this authority to support mission requirements.
18.16. Night Differentials. The FSS Commander/Director ensures that all eligible employees
are paid night differentials as follows:
   18.16.1. Night Shift Differential. For regularly scheduled nonovertime work, CT and pay
   band (NF-I and NF-II) employees receive their scheduled rate of basic pay plus:
         18.16.1.1. A differential of 7 ½ % of scheduled rate when a majority of whole hours
         worked occurs between 3:00 PM and midnight.
         18.16.1.2. A differential of 10% when the majority of whole hours worked occurs
         between 11:00 PM and 8:00 AM.
      18.16.2. Night Shift Differential CT and NFI and NFII Employees.
         18.16.2.1. Basic Entitlements. An employee is paid at the scheduled rate of basic pay,
         plus a differential of 7½ percent of that scheduled rate for regularly scheduled
         nonovertime work when a majority of whole hours worked occurs between 1500 and
         midnight; or 10 percent when the majority of whole hours worked occurs between 2300
         and 0800. Nightshift differential is included in the rates of basic pay that are used for
         computing overtime pay, Sunday premium pay, and holiday premium pay. Nightshift
         differential is not included in determining the amounts to be deducted for retirement,
         group health insurance, or group life insurance.
             18.16.2.1.1. Meal periods of 1 hour or less that occur when a nightshift differential is
             authorized are included for determining an employee's entitlement to nightshift
             differential. Thus, if an employee works from 1130 to 2000 with a meal break from
             1530 to 1600, the 30 minute meal break is included to determine that a majority of
             whole hours of work occurred during the second shift and 7½ percent nightshift
             differential is payable. The following examples show how meal breaks of 1 hour or
             less are included in the computation of "majority of whole hours."
                18.16.2.1.1.1. An employee works an 8hour shift from 1130 to 2000. The meal
                break is set from 1530 to 1600 and is included in the 5hour period from 1500 to
                2000. Because a majority of whole hours worked occurs between 1500 and
                midnight, the employee is entitled to a 7½ percent shift differential for the entire
                shift.
                18.16.2.1.1.2. An employee works an 8hour shift from 1100 to 1930. The meal
                break is set from 1500 to 1530. No shift differential is paid, since there is no
                majority of whole hours worked between 1500 and midnight, that is, he or she is
                credited only 4 ½ hours during the second shift.
                18.16.2.1.1.3. An employee works an 8hour shift from 1900 to 0330. The meal
                break is set from 2300 to 2330. The employee is paid a 7½ percent differential
                for all 8 hours since a majority of his or her hours are worked during a period in
                which a nightshift differential is payable. The 10 percent differential is not paid
                because the employee's regularly scheduled 8hour shift does not fall within the
                period of 2300 to 0800.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   253


        18.16.2.1.2. There is no authority for splitting the nightshift differential. An
        employee receives the proper differential for the entire shift, based on the majority of
        whole hours worked. These examples show nightshift differential entitlements, under
        the "majority of whole hours" concept, when an employee's tour of duty either
        overlaps more than one established shift or includes a split shift within a scheduled
        workday:
            18.16.2.1.2.1. An employee works an 8hour shift from 2000 to 0400 with a
            20minute paid meal period. The employee works 3 hours in the second shift (7½
            percent differential) and 5 hours in the third shift (10% differential). He or she is
            paid a 10% differential for all 8 hours, since a majority of whole hours falls within
            a period for which the 10% nightshift differential is payable.
            18.16.2.1.2.2. An employee works an 8hour shift from 1900 to 0300 with a
            20minute paid meal period. The employee works 4 hours during the second shift
            (7 ½ percent differential) and 4 hours in the third shift (10% differential). He or
            she is paid a 10% differential for the entire shift, since the hours were equally split
            between the shifts. This is to the advantage of the employee.
            18.16.2.1.2.3. An employee works a split shift from 0500 to 1100 and from 1500
            to 1700. The employee works 3 hours during the third shift, 3 hours during the
            first shift, and 2 hours during the second shift. He or she is entitled to a 7½
            percent nightshift differential for all 8 hours, since a majority of his or her
            regularly scheduled hours of work fall within a period during which a nightshift
            differential is payable. The 10% differential is not paid, since a majority of his or
            her regularly scheduled 8hour shift does not fall within the period of 2300 to
            0800.
            18.16.2.1.2.4. An employee works a split shift from 1000 to 1200 and from 1600
            to 2000. Hours worked total 6 hours, with the employee performing 4 hours of
            work during the established nightshift period. This employee is entitled to the 7½
            percent nightshift differential for all hours of work performed (6 hours), as the
            majority of the hours worked was after 1500.
     18.16.2.2. Less Than 8Hour Tour of Duty. An employee who works on a regularly
     scheduled shift of less than 8 hours is entitled to a nightshift differential, if a majority of
     whole hours is worked during a period in which a nightshift differential is payable. For
     example:
        18.16.2.2.1. An employee who works a regular schedule from 1300 to 1900 is paid
        secondshift night differential at 7½ percent for all hours, because the majority of
        whole hours (4) are worked during a period to which a nightshift differential is
        payable.
        18.16.2.2.2. An employee is regularly scheduled to work a period starting at 1400
        and ending at 2000. Since the majority of whole hours worked are during a period for
        which the nightshift differential of 7½ percent is payable, the employee is entitled to
        that differential for his or her entire shift.
        18.16.2.2.3. An employee is regularly scheduled to work a period starting at 1300
        and ending at 1730. Since the employee works 2 hours before the nightshift period
254                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


          began and only 2½ hours within the nightshift period, the employee is not entitled to
          the nightshift differential. (In order for this employee to qualify for the differential,
          he or she must work 3 whole hours during the applicable nightshift period.)
      18.16.2.3. Absence on a Holiday or in Travel Status. An employee regularly assigned
      to a night shift for which the nightshift differential is payable, is entitled to the nightshift
      differential for periods of excused absences on holidays, while on court leave, or while in
      official travel status during the hours of his or her regular night shift.
      18.16.2.4. Absence on Leave. The nightshift differential payable during periods of
      leave with pay depends on the shift to which the employee is assigned (at the time of
      going on leave) and the duration of the assignment. An employee who is:
          18.16.2.4.1. Regularly assigned to a night shift on a fulltime basis, during periods of
          absence with pay, receives the nightshift differential.
          18.16.2.4.2. Assigned to a regular rotating schedule that involves work on both day
          and night shifts, during periods of absence with pay, receives pay as follows:
              18.16.2.4.2.1. Pay at rates payable on the day shift is paid for that portion of the
              absence that occurs during periods when the employee is scheduled to work the
              day shift.
              18.16.2.4.2.2. Night-shift differential is payable for the portion of the absence
              that occurs during periods when the employee is scheduled to work nightshifts.
          18.16.2.4.3. Regularly scheduled to work the day shift and who is absent with pay
          during a temporary assignment to shifts for which a nightshift differential is payable,
          is paid as follows:
              18.16.2.4.3.1. If the assignment to the night shift is indefinite and no expiration
              date is specified for the assignment, an employee going on leave with pay, while
              so assigned, receives the nightshift differential during the period of the absence
              for which a nightshift differential is payable.
              18.16.2.4.3.2. If the assignment to the night shift is of specified duration, an
              employee going on leave, while so assigned, receives the nightshift differential
              only for that portion of the absence that is within the specified period of the
              nightshift assignment. After the specified period expires, his or her pay reverts to
              the day rate.
          18.16.2.4.4. Changed from the day to the night shift at irregular intervals, and it
          cannot be determined that he or she is assigned basically to either shift, the payment
          during periods of absence with pay is at the rate for the shift on which the employee
          was working at the time the absence began.
      18.16.2.5. Temporary Assignment to a Different Tour of Duty.                    An employee
      regularly assigned to a:
          18.16.2.5.1. Night-shift, but who is temporarily assigned to another night-shift with a
          higher differential, receives the higher differential, if the majority of the employee's
          regularly scheduled nonovertime "whole hours" of work, during the temporary
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   255


          assignment, is within a regularly scheduled shift for which the higher differential is
          payable.
          18.16.2.5.2. Day shift is entitled to a nightshift differential for any temporary regular
          shift assignment for which a nightshift differential is otherwise payable.
          18.16.2.5.3. Night-shift is entitled to a nightshift differential for any period during
          which he or she is temporarily assigned to work a day shift. Similarly, an employee
          regularly assigned to the third shift, who is temporarily assigned to the second shift, is
          entitled to continue to receive a 10 percent differential.

   their scheduled rate of basic pay plus an additional differential of 10% of the scheduled rate
   for work which falls between 6:00 PM and 6:00 AM. The night pay differential is in addition
   to overtime, Sunday premium, or holiday premium pay and is not included in the rate of
   basic pay used to compute the overtime or holiday pay.
      18.16.3.1. An eligible employee is entitled to night pay differential:
          18.16.3.1.1. For a period when excused from night work on a holiday or any other
          excused day.
          18.16.3.1.2. For night hours of his or her tour when in an official travel status.
          18.16.3.1.3. During periods of paid leave, if the amount of that leave is less than 8
          hours in a pay period.

      18.17.1. Basic Entitlement.
         18.17.1.1. A regular or flexible CT employee who performs work during a regularly
         scheduled tour of duty of 8 hours or less, which is not overtime and any part of which is
         performed on a Sunday, is entitled to receive Sunday premium pay.
         18.17.1.2. The FSS commander/director establishes the basic policy of whether or not
         Sunday premium is paid to NF and CY employees as follows:
            18.17.1.2.1. All eligible employees are similarly paid; either all are paid Sunday
            premium pay, or all are not.
            18.17.1.2.2. Procedures for payment of Sunday premium pay are according to
            paragraph 18.17.2.
            18.17.1.2.2.1. The basic policy is established in writing, with a copy furnished the
            NAF-HR and NAF AO.
   18.17.2. Procedures.
         18.17.2.1. A regular or flexible CT employee who performs work during a regularly
         scheduled tour of duty of 8 hours or less, which is not overtime and any part of which is
         performed on a Sunday, is entitled to pay for the entire tour of duty at the rate of his or
         her rate of basic pay, plus premium pay at a rate equal to 25 percent of his or her rate of
         basic pay. For example, an employee whose work schedule begins at 1800 and ends at
         0230 each day, Tuesday through Saturday, is entitled to Sunday premium pay for the
         Saturday schedule, computed as shown in figure 18.2.
         18.17.2.2. Premium pay for Sunday work is in addition to premium pay for holiday
         work, overtime pay, and nightshift differential, and is not included in the rate of basic pay
         used to compute the pay for holiday, overtime, and night work.
         18.17.2.3. When an employee has two separate tours of duty on Sunday (such as a tour
         that begins on Saturday and ends on Sunday and another tour of duty that begins on
         Sunday and concludes on Monday), he or she is entitled to premium pay for Sunday
         work, not to exceed 8 hours for each tour of duty. For example, an employee who works
         a regularly scheduled night shift, from 1700 to 0130 (with a 30 minute meal period), on
         Sunday and Wednesday through Saturday. The employee is entitled to Sunday premium
         pay for two tours (Saturday and Sunday for a total of 16 hours), computed as shown in
         figure 18.2.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              257

NOTES:

1. A regular employee whose workday covers portions of two calendar days, and who, except
for this section, would ordinarily be excused from work for the hours of any calendar day on
which the holiday falls, will instead be excused from work on his or her entire workday that
starts on the calendar day on which the holiday begins.

2. When management closes an activity on a Friday or a Monday because of a holiday on a
Saturday or Sunday, regular employees whose scheduled workweek includes the Saturday or
Sunday holiday, or the Saturday or Sunday holiday and the closed Friday or Monday, observe
the official holiday. Those regular employees whose scheduled workweeks include only the
closed Friday or Monday, observe the holiday on the closed day.

3. When management elects to close an activity the day preceding or following a holiday that
falls on a day other than Saturday or Sunday, the official holiday is the observed day.

18.19. Holiday Pay and Holiday Premium Pay.
      18.19.1. Pay for Holidays on Which NAF Employees are Excused From Work. An
      employee entitled to observe the holiday, and who is excused from work because of the
      occurrence of a holiday, is entitled to holiday pay (which is regular base pay, including any
      applicable night shift differential) for the number of nonovertime hours that would have been
      scheduled had it not been a holiday.
      18.19.2. Pay for Work Performed on a Holiday. An employee entitled to observe the
      holiday, and who performs work on a holiday, is entitled to holiday pay (which is regular
      base pay, including any applicable night shift differential) for the number of scheduled hours,
      plus holiday premium pay (which is at a rate equal to regular base pay) for the number of
      nonovertime hours that do not exceed 8 hours actually worked on the holiday.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               259


   18.19.3. Pay for Uncommon Conditions.
      18.19.3.1. A regular employee whose workday covers portions of 2 calendar days, who
      is required to work, is paid holiday premium pay only for the workday that begins on the
      holiday.
      18.19.3.2. Pay for overtime work performed on a holiday is paid at the same rate as for
      overtime on other workdays.
      18.19.3.3. If an eligible employee is in an approved LWOP status on the scheduled
      workday before and the scheduled workday after the holiday, the employee is not entitled
      to pay for the holiday.
      18.19.3.4. If an eligible employee is AWOL on the scheduled workday before the
      holiday, he or she is considered AWOL for the holiday, and is not entitled to be excused
      or paid for the holiday.
      18.19.3.5. If an employee fails to report for duty after being notified he or she is
      scheduled to work the holiday and he or she fails to provide an acceptable reason for the
      absence, the employee is considered AWOL and is not entitled to pay for the holiday.
      (AWOL may also lead to disciplinary action.)
      18.19.3.6. If management closes an activity on a Friday or a Monday because of a
      holiday falling on a Saturday or a Sunday, regular employees whose scheduled workweek
      includes the holiday and the closed day (who are not required to work either day) are paid
      regular basic pay for the holiday. Care must be exercised to ensure the hours lost due to
      the closed day do not adversely affect an employee's entitlement to compensation for
      their guaranteed workweek hours.
      18.19.3.7. If management elects to close the day preceding or following a holiday that
      falls on a day other than Saturday or Sunday, regular employees whose scheduled
      workweek includes both the holiday and the closed day (who are not required to work)
      are paid regular basic pay for the holiday. Care must be exercised to ensure that the
      hours lost due to the closed day do not adversely affect an employee's entitlement to
      compensation for their guaranteed workweek hours.
      18.19.3.8. A regular employee called to work on a holiday is entitled to at least 2 hours
      of holiday premium pay, whether or not work is actually performed.
18.20. Examples of Pay Entitlement for Holidays Worked and Not Worked.
   18.20.1. Example 1. A regular employee's regularly scheduled workweek is 1400 to 2230,

18.21. Pay Limitations for NF-IV and NF-V. In addition to a cash award ceiling of 5 percent
for NF-IV pay band employees or greater, a pay adjustment ceiling of 4 percent in a 12-month
period is also in effect. The 12-month period is the 12 months preceding the proposed effective
date of award or pay adjustment. The following are exceptions to that limitation: (1) cost-of-
living adjustments, (2) promotions involving movement to a different position, and (3)
competitive reassignments to positions with increased responsibility within the same pay band
(e.g., NF-IV Assistant Manager to NF-IV Manager).
   18.21.1. Requests for other exceptions to this policy (such as significant job growth within a
   pay ban requiring a new position guide) may be submitted through MAJCOM/A1S to HQ
   AFSVA/SVX for HQ USAF/A1S approval. Submissions must include:
       18.21.1.1. Previous salary, proposed percentage increase and justification.

      18.21.1.4. Any relevant data to support the proposed pay bonus increase.
18.22. Travel and Transportation.
   18.22.1. PCS.
      18.22.1.1. CONUS and Nonforeign Areas. Regular employees selected for PCS to a
      NAFI at another AF installation in the CONUS or a nonforeign area and who sign a
      transportation agreement may be allowed essential travel and transportation expenses for
      themselves and their family members and shipment of household goods (HHG). This
      includes PCS travel and transportation from their present actual residence to their new
      duty station and all other entitlements as authorized by the JTR, Volume 2, if it is clearly
      in the interest of the gaining NAFI, and the gaining FSS commander/director approves
      the expenditure of NAFs for that purpose. Career program employee PCS moves are
      centrally funded.
      18.22.1.2. Transfer of Function. Regular employees transferred by a transfer of
      function may be provided travel and transportation expenses in the same manner as
      described in paragraph 18.22.
      18.22.1.3. Travel Time Expense Charge. Employees authorized PCS travel and
      transportation expenses must travel on the gaining NAFI's time. While in a travel status,
      the employee is paid basic pay as if already on the job.
      18.22.1.4. Foreign Areas. See paragraph 16.3.5.
   18.22.2. TDY Travel. Regular employees selected for training or who are required to attend
   conferences, seminars, etc., are placed on TDY for travel to, during, and from the place of
   temporary duty. While in TDY status, the employee is paid his or her basic pay as if
   currently on the job. Payment for per diem and travel expenses is borne by the parent NAFI,
   MAJCOM NAFI, AF central NAFI, or APFs and must not exceed that authorized by the
   JTR, Volume 2.
      18.22.2.1. Additional Compensation During Official TDY and Travel. Fair Labor
      Standards Act (FLSA) exempt employees receive additional compensation for the time
      spent in a travel status that occurs during or outside regular working hours, as shown in
      Attachment 20. The FLSA nonexempt employee receives additional compensation for
      the time spent in a travel status that occurs during or outside regular working hours, as
      shown in Attachment 21. In the overseas area, all employees receive additional
      compensation for the time spent in a travel status as shown in Attachment 20.
   18.22.3. Wage Area Surveys. Travel and transportation expenses are paid (where proper
   under the JTR, Volume 2) to employees assigned duties associated with wage area surveys.
   18.22.4. Use of PrivatelyOwned Vehicles by NAF Employees When Conducting NAFI
   business. When considered advantageous to the NAFI, and with prior supervisory approval,
   employees may be reimbursed for use of their privatelyowned vehicles in the conduct of
   NAFI business. In such cases, reimbursement is limited to the mileage and is at the rate
   authorized by the JTR, Volume 2.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                265


18.23. Hazard and Environmental Differentials. Payment of such differentials for NFIII
through NFVI employees is made according to 5 CFR, Part 550, Subpart I, Pay for Duty
Involving Physical Hardship or Hazard. Payment for CT employees is made according to OPM
Federal Wage System-NAF, Subchapter S8. Procedures for payment of such differentials for
NFI and NFII positions have not been established. Cases involving either of these latter two
categories are sent, through command channels, to HQ AFSVA/SVXH for a determination. Use
OPM Federal Wage System-NAF, Subchapter S8 as a guide.
18.24. Severance Pay.
   18.24.1. A regular NAF employee who has completed at least 12 continuous months of
   service as a regular NAF employee, and who is involuntarily separated from employment as
   a result of a BBA, receives severance pay, unless the employee:
       18.24.1.1. Is employed, without a break in service of more than 3 calendar days after
       separation, in another DoD NAF Regular position, or a DoD APF position, without a
       time limit on the length of the appointment.
Note: DoD NAF employees who move to DoD APF positions without a break in service of
more than 3 days are eligible for portability of benefits under Public Law 101-508, as amended.
Under 5 CFR 550.708, NAF service is creditable for computing a employee’s APF severance
pay if the employee is later separated from an APF position under conditions entitling the
employee to APF severance pay.
       18.24.1.2. Refuses an offer of employment in any DoD NAFI that would not result in a
       rate of basic pay that is lower than the rate of basic pay received immediately before the
       BBA, or a loss of employment category (i.e., from Regular to Flexible). Offers must be
       in the same commuting area, unless the employee is covered by an agreement in which
       mobility is a condition of employment.
       18.24.1.3. Is entitled to an immediate annuity that is not reduced because of the
       employee's age at the time of retirement. This exclusion covers an annuity from a NAF
       retirement plan, or from a civil service retirement plan in which the employee elected to
       remain following movement between employment systems under 5 U.S.C., 8347(q) and
       8461(n).
       18.24.1.4. Is receiving payments from the Department of Labor’s Office of Workers’
       Compensation Programs for a job-related injury.
   18.24.2. Conditions under which eligible employees receive severance pay include:
       18.24.2.1. The employee is separated. An employee who resigns following receipt of a
       specific written notice of separation due to BBA or a general written notice that
       announces that all positions will be abolished is considered to have been involuntarily
       separated.
       18.24.2.2. The employee’s basic pay is reduced, and the employee resigns instead of
       accepting the reduction.
       18.24.2.3. The employee’s employment category is involuntarily changed from Regular
       to Flexible and the employee resigns instead of accepting the change.

      18.24.2.4. The employee is furloughed for more than 60 consecutive days and resigns in
      lieu of accepting the furlough.
   18.24.3. The twelve continuous months of regular service required to be eligible for
   severance pay includes:
      18.24.3.1. Periods of regular service in one or more DoD NAFIs.
      18.24.3.2. Nonwork periods, of any amount, due to absence on military furlough or on
      workers’ compensation.
      18.24.3.3. Nonwork periods after separation from regular service, if reinstatement as a
      regular employee to the NAFI is made within 6 months after separation from that NAFI.
      NOTE: If severance pay was paid at the time of separation, this period is not creditable,
      and the new continuous period begins with the date of reinstatement.
      18.24.3.4. Periods of paid absence.
      18.24.3.5. Service in a continuing (i.e., without a time limit on the length of the
      appointment) APF position, if the employee moved from a DoD APF position to a DoD
      NAF position on or after January 1, 1987, without a break in service of more than 3
      calendar days.
      18.24.3.6. Periods of regular service in any NAFI, when the movement from one NAFI
      to another is without a break in service of more or more workdays.
      18.24.3.7. Military service that interrupted creditable service, as prescribed in Chapter 43
      of 38 U.S.C.
   18.24.4. The twelve continuous months of regular service required to be eligible for
   severance does not include:
      18.24.4.1. Periods of intervening flexible service in a NAFI.
      18.24.4.2. Periods of regular service in other NAFIs, when there was a break in service
      of one or more workdays when moved between NAFIs.
      18.24.4.3. Periods of regular service before a break in service of more than 6 months.
      18.24.4.4. Service upon which a NAF or civil service annuity is based, if the annuity
      began before the date of the BBA.
      18.24.4.5. Periods of service for which NAF or APF severance pay was previously
      granted.
      18.24.4.6. Service used to determine an employee’s APF severance pay entitlement
      under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5595.
      18.24.4.7. Time served as a regular NAFI employee, as shown in paragraph 18.24.3, is
      creditable service for computing the amount of severance pay due an eligible employee.
      Periods of regular employment before a separation resulting in severance pay, are not
      considered in determining either the 12month eligibility period or in computing
      creditable service for determining the amount of severance pay for a subsequent
      qualifying involuntary separation.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  267


     18.24.4.8. An employee issued a BBA separation notice, and is otherwise eligible, is
     entitled to severance pay if he or she resigns during the notice period of the separation
     action. For the purpose of this paragraph, otherwise eligible means that the employee
     meets the requirements for eligibility as outlined in paragraph 18.24.1.
  18.24.5. Severance pay consists of:
     18.24.5.1. One week's pay, at the rate of basic pay that the employee is receiving at the
     time of separation, for each full year of continuous regular service for the first 10 years of
     service.
     18.24.5.2. Two week's pay, at the rate of basic pay that the employee is receiving at the
     time of separation, for each full year of continuous regular service beyond 10 years of
     service.
     18.24.5.3. Partial credit for each full 3 months of continuous regular service beyond the
     final full year of service.
         18.24.5.3.1. If the total service, including a partial year of service, is less than 10
         years, credit the severance pay entitlement by 25 percent of 1 week's pay for each full
         three months of service.
         18.24.5.3.2. If the total service, including a partial year of service, is greater than 10
         years, credit the severance pay entitlement by 25 percent of 2 week's pay for each full
         3 months of service.
     18.24.5.4. The maximum amount of severance pay an employee may receive is 52 weeks
     of basic pay at the rate of basic pay received immediately before separation.
  18.24.6. In computing the severance pay, the employee's rate of basic pay is the hourly rate
  of pay received immediately before separation multiplied by the greater of:
     18.24.6.1. The average number of hours worked per week over the 13 pay periods
     immediately prior to the date of the BBA memorandum.
     18.24.6.2. The employee's guaranteed hours immediately prior to the date of the BBA
     memorandum.
     18.24.6.3. If, on the day preceding the effective date of the BBA, the employee is not
     present for duty due to an on-the-job injury or illness compensable under applicable
     workers’ compensation law, severance pay will be computed by multiplying the
     employee’s rate of basic pay on the day before the effective date of the BBA times the
     greater of:
         18.24.6.3.1. The employee’s average number of hours worked per week during the
         13 pay periods immediately prior to the effective date of the BBA;
         18.24.6.3.2. The employee’s guaranteed hours immediately prior to the effective date
         of the BBA; or,
         18.24.6.3.3. The employee’s average number of hours worked per week during the
         13 pay periods immediately prior to the date of the on-the-job injury or illness.
     18.24.6.4. Examples of severance pay computation:

         18.24.6.4.1. A regular employee has 1 year and 1 month of continuous regular
         service, has a guaranteed 40 hour workweek, and a basic rate of pay of $9.50 ph. The
         employee is entitled to 1 week of severance pay, $380.00 (40 hrs x $9.50 ph).
         18.24.6.4.2. A regular employee has 16 years, 6 months, and 59 days of continuous
         regular service. The employee has worked an average of 30 hours per week over the
         last 13 pay periods, and has a guaranteed 20 hours workweek. The employee's rate of
         pay is $7.00 ph. The employee's severance pay entitlement is $4,830.00.

   18.24.7. Payment of Severance Pay.
      18.24.7.1. Severance pay is payable to an employee at the same pay period intervals that
      salary would be paid if the employee were still employed. The total severance pay
      entitlement is paid in bi-weekly payments equal to the bi-weekly payment the employee
      is receiving at the time of separation, and is subject to income tax, Medicare, and FICA
      deductions. The final payment is a full or partial payment consisting of that portion of
      the severance pay total entitlement remaining unpaid.
      18.24.7.2. If the total severance pay entitlement would otherwise be distributed in four
      biweekly payments or less, a lump sum payment of the total severance pay entitlement is
      made.
      18.24.7.3. The NAF-HR records on the AF Form 2545 a remark that includes the total
      severance pay entitlement, the bi-weekly payment, and the number of weeks the
      entitlement is paid.
      18.24.7.4. Entitlement to severance pay ends when an employee is appointed to another
      regular DoD NAF position, or when the severance pay entitlement for the employee is
      exhausted.
      18.24.7.5. In the event an employee dies while in receipt of severance payments, the
      entitlement passes to the beneficiary of the individual.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              269


      18.24.7.6. Upon reemployment of a former federal employee, the NAF-HR records on
      the AF Form 2545 the number of weeks of severance pay received (including partial
      weeks). If the employee again becomes entitled to severance pay, the NAF-HR
      recomputes the severance pay allowance on the basis of all creditable service and deducts
      from the entitlement the number of weeks for which severance pay previously was
      received. No period of service (NAF or APF) for which severance pay (NAF or APF)
      was previously granted is included.
      18.24.7.7. At the time the business-based action separation notice is issued, the NAF-HR
      advises employees, in writing, of the requirement to report employment with a DoD
      NAFI should that employment be obtained while the employee is receiving severance
      payments.
      18.24.7.8. During the time an employee is receiving severance payments, a written
      notice is provided with each payment, reminding the employee of the requirement to
      report DoD NAF employment immediately to the office making the severance payments.
18.25. Allowances and Differentials.
   18.25.1. Nonforeign Area. A nonforeign allowance or differential established for APF
   employees is not granted to employees in pay bands NF-I and NF-II as their rates already are
   based on the prevailing rate, but may be granted to employees in pay bands NF-III through
   NF-VI. NFIII through NFVI employees are entitled to the same nonforeign area allowances
   authorized to APF employees in 5 U.S.C. 5941 and 5942; 5 C.F.R. Part 591, Subparts b and
   c.
   18.25.2. Foreign Area. Executive Order 11137, ―Relating to certain allowances and
   benefits for civilian employees of NAFI of the Armed Forces,‖ January 7, 1964, authorizes
   the DoD to prescribe regulations providing allowances and differentials in foreign areas to
   DoD NAF employees. Refer to 16.3.4. for foreign area Allowances and Differentials.
      18.25.2.1. With the exception of post allowance, it is DoD policy that the payment of
      allowances and differentials to NAF employees in foreign areas shall be on the same
      basis as such allowances and differentials are paid to DoD APF employees under Volume
      1250, ―Overseas Allowances and Differentials‖ of DoDI 1400.25. This adoption of
      Volume 1250 so that it applies to DoD NAF employees, except for the purposes of post
      allowance, includes eligibility criteria and delegation of authority restrictions.
      18.25.2.2. To be eligible for post allowance, a NAF employee must be a U.S. citizen
      living in a foreign area and employed in a Regular full-time position. Full-time position
      is defined as 40 hours per week and covers all employees in Regular positions who
      regularly work the required full-time schedule of hours. Regular employees who work
      less than 40 hours, Flexible employees, and seasonal (summer/winter) hire employees are
      not eligible for post allowance.

18.26. Allotments or Net Pay to a Financial Organization (FO); Allotments for Savings
Bonds, Union Dues, Combined Federal Campaign (CFC), or for Alimony or Child
Support.
   18.26.1. An employee may designate specific amounts to be deducted each pay period in the
   form of an allotment to a FO, or may designate a specific amount be applied for purchasing a
   savings bond.
   18.26.2. Any employee may have his or her net pay sent to a FO.
   18.26.3. An employee in the bargaining unit may use payroll deduction to withhold dues for
   labor organizations.
   18.26.4. A regular employee may contribute to the CFC by a payroll deduction each pay
   period, using the CFC provided form.
   18.26.5. An employee may voluntarily designate specific amounts for alimony or child
   support. (See paragraph 18.31 for garnishment orders that are involuntary allotments.) The
   request must be by memorandum. Such a memorandum, signed by the employee, is sent to
   the servicing NAF Payroll Liaison and must:
       18.26.5.1. Designate the allottee and the amount of the allotment.
       18.26.5.2. Include a statement that the NAFI is held harmless for any authorized
       allotment disbursed by the NAFI, according to the employee's request for an allotment
       from pay.
       18.26.5.3. Include a statement that disputes regarding any authorized allotment are a
       matter between the allotter and the allottee.
18.27. Withholding Taxes.
   18.27.1. Federal income taxes are withheld from the employee's compensation according to
   the Internal Revenue Code.
   18.27.2. State income taxes are withheld in those states that have a withholding agreement
   with the Secretary of the Treasury, according to Department of Treasury regulations.
   18.27.3. City income taxes are withheld in cities that have a withholding agreement with the
   Secretary of the Treasury, according to Department of Treasury regulations.
   18.27.4. Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue
   Code are deducted from the wages of all employees in:
       18.27.4.1. The U.S., Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, regardless of
       citizenship.
       18.27.4.2. Other geographical areas for those who are citizens of the U.S.
18.28. Lump Sum Leave (LSL) Payments. LSL payments are mandatory on separation, and
on a change in employment category from a regular to nonregular position, with the following
exception. If a regular employee moves from an AF NAFI to a nonAF NAFI, without a break in
service of one workday, the employee is paid by the losing NAFI for the accumulated annual
leave credited to his or her account. If the employee elects and the gaining and losing NAFIs
agree, dollar liability may be transferred, from the losing to the gaining NAFI by a transfer of
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   271


funds to cover the cost of the accumulated leave credit. Any amounts due a NAFI according to
paragraph 18.31 are withheld from any wages and LSL due the employee, excluding the
retirement account, if the required procedures for collection are followed. Instructions for
transferring leave to another AF NAFI are in Chapter 14. Instructions for crediting leave upon
movement between NAF and APF employment systems are in Chapter 13.
   18.28.1. Computation of LSL. The LSL payment for annual leave earned in a NAFI is
   computed only if the employee has completed 90 days as a regular employee in that NAFI. It
   is computed on the basis of the employee's entitlements at the time of separation or change to
   a nonregular category. This payment is for the number of hours carried over into the new
   leave year, plus current accrual (less usage) to the separation date.
       18.28.1.1. When an employee is on the rolls on the issue date of a wage schedule, but
       separates before the effective date of the increase, the employee is entitled to receive his
       or her lump sum annual leave payment at the higher rate for the period extending beyond
       the effective date.
       18.28.1.2. When an employee separates after a wage survey is ordered but before the
       issue date of the wage schedule, and his or her annual leave extends beyond the effective
       date of the increase, the employee is entitled to receive his or her lump sum annual leave
       payment at the higher rate for the period extending beyond the effective date. This
       provision applies when the issue date of the wage schedule is before the effective date set
       by Title 5 U.S.C. When wage schedules are adjusted according to a wage survey, the
       survey order date is shown on the schedule.
   18.28.2. LSL Payment Rate. The LSL payment is made at the basic rate of pay (the
   employee's scheduled rate of pay, plus nightshift differential for CT, NFI and NFII
   employees only) that applies for all regularly scheduled night duty periods, covered by the
   unused annual leave, as if the employee had continued to work beyond the effective date of
   separation. If a night shift is formally cancelled or an employee is regularly scheduled for
   continuous day shift work, on or before the date of separation, the LSL payment is computed
   at the day rate.
   18.28.3. Death Benefits. LSL payments due a deceased employee are paid to the designated
   beneficiary, together with any pay due the employee.
   18.28.4. Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) and Differentials in the LSL Payment.
       18.28.4.1. Foreign Areas. Foreign area allowances are not included in computing LSL
       payments. The foreign post differential is an additional compensation and is included in
       computing the LSL, if the employee is receiving differential just before the separation
       date and if (on the effective date of separation) he or she is at the permanent duty post for
       which such additional compensation is authorized. The differential is not included in
       computing an employee's LSL payment for annual leave, if the effective separation date
       is after the employee has left the permanent duty post.
       18.28.4.2. Nonforeign Areas. A nonforeign COLA or nonforeign differential is
       included in an LSL payment, if the employee is receiving the allowance or differential
       just before the date he or she separates from the nonforeign assignment post for which
       such additional compensation is authorized. The allowance or differential is not included
       in a LSL payment, if the effective date of the separation is after the employee has left the
272                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


         nonforeign assignment post (like going on annual leave to secure a position outside the
         nonforeign area).
18.29. Callback Duty Time. Callback duty time is when a regularly scheduled, regular or
flexible employee is required to work on a day when work was not scheduled, or when the
employee is officially required to return to his or her place of employment. Compensation for
callback duty is at least 2 hours (whether or not work is performed), including make-ready and
cleanup time. Compensation is computed at the employee's regular basic rate of pay, unless the
number of hours worked that day or week entitle the employee to overtime pay.
18.30. Call-in Duty Time. Call-in duty time is work performed by an unscheduled flexible
employee who is officially required to report for work. Compensation for call-in duty must be at
least 2 hours, (whether or not work is performed), including make-ready and cleanup time.
Compensation is at the employee's regular basic rate of pay, unless the employee is entitled to
overtime pay.
18.31. Withholding Pay and Allowances. When required collection procedures have been
followed, an employee's pay and allowances, including LSL but excluding the retirement
account, may be withheld in these situations:
   18.31.1. When the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) levies for delinquent federal taxes.
   18.31.2. When an NAF employee's pay is garnished for child support or alimony payments.
   Garnishment writs or orders must be processed according to AFI 34-202, Protecting NAF
   Assets, after being duly served upon the AF service of process point, HQ AFSVA/SVL, NAF
   Law Division.
   18.31.3. To discharge indebtedness to the employing NAFI, e.g., refund of school tuition,
   travel advances, erroneous payments of wages, etc.
   18.31.4. To refund unearned leave. i.e., to reimburse NAFIs that have advanced annual or
   sick leave for any balances not earned.
   18.31.5. When the employing NAFI is ordered by a federal bankruptcy court to pay all or
   any part of income due the employee to a trustee.
   18.31.6. When judgment levies by U.S. Federal Court under Public Law 97-246, Section 124
   are ordered.
18.32. Back Pay. This paragraph applies to the computation, payment, and restoration of pay,
allowances, differentials, and employment benefits for the purpose of making an employee
whole, when the employee, on the basis of administrative determination or timely appeal, is
found to have undergone an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.
      18.32.1. Terms Used.
         18.32.1.1. Appropriate Authority. An installation commander; a group commander; a
         squadron commander; a court having jurisdiction; the OPM for NAF CT employees; an
         Assistant Secretary of the AF; an administrative authority designated in Public Law

AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                273


     pay band employees; officials in EEO cases; an arbitrator in binding arbitration cases; a
     deciding official on an appeal or grievance, or the servicing NAF-HR.
     18.32.1.2. Employee. An employee or former employee of the NAFI.
     18.32.1.3. An Unjustified or Unwarranted Personnel Action. An action, which may
     include a pay action that, as subsequently determined, violated or improperly applied
     those requirements of a nondiscretionary provision and thereby resulted in the withdrawal
     or denial of all or any part of pay, allowances, differentials, or benefits otherwise due an
     employee. The action may be one of commission or omission.
     18.32.1.4. Nondiscretionary Provision. Any provision of law, executive order (EO),
     regulation, personnel policy, or collective bargaining agreement applicable to NAFIs that
     requires the NAF-HR to take a prescribed action under stated conditions or criteria.
     18.32.1.5. Pay. The basic rate of pay, as defined under the applicable NAF pay system,
     or a retained rate; statutory or administrative pay increases, within grade increases, and
     premium pay (including scheduled overtime, night, holiday, standby, and Sunday pay);
     retained pay; pay adjustments; and hazardous and environmental pay; also pay for
     annual, sick, military, and court leave.
     18.32.1.6. Allowances. Living quarters; post or cost of living; education; separate

     18.32.1.7. Differential. Post differential.
     18.32.1.8. Benefits. Health and life insurance and retirement.
     18.32.1.9. Personnel Action. Any personnel action by an authorized official, which
     results in the withdrawal or reduction of all or any part of the pay, allowance, or
     differentials of an employee, and includes, but is not limited to, separations for any
     reason (including retirement), suspensions, furloughs without pay, demotions, reductions
     in pay, and periods of enforced paid leave.
     18.32.1.10. Administrative Determination. A written administrative determination,
     made by an appropriate authority as defined in paragraph 18.32.1.1, that states an
     individual has taken a personnel action he or she was prohibited from taking, has taken a
     personnel action not authorized by law or regulation, or has not taken a personnel action
     he or she was required to take.
     18.32.1.11. Timely Appeal. When an employee or personal representative initiates a
     claim, an appeal, or grievance and that claim, appeal, or grievance is accepted as timely
     filed by the appropriate authority.
  18.32.2. Statutes of Limitations. For purposes of determining whether or not an unjustified
  or unwarranted personnel action can be corrected, the statute of limitations for a claim
  against an AF NAFI by an employee or former employee must be met. It must be presented
  to the NAF-HR within 2 years of the date of an alleged unjustified or unwarranted personnel
  action or the date the employee first became aware of it. Three years is allowed for
  complaints involving alleged deliberate violations. In addition, any other regulatory
  limitation on submitting an appeal or grievance also applies. Back pay is awarded under this
  paragraph only if this statute of limitations is not exceeded; the claim, appeal, or grievance
  has been accepted as "timely" filed by the administrative individual or body having
274                                                       AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      jurisdiction over the claim, appeal, or grievance; and the conditions spelled out in paragraph
      18.32.3 are met.
      18.32.3. Basic Entitlement.
         18.32.3.1. To be entitled to corrective action and subsequent back pay, all of these
         criteria must be met:
             18.32.3.1.1. The act of commission or of omission resulted in an actual withdrawal,
             reduction, or denial of pay, allowances, benefits, or differentials of an employee.
             18.32.3.1.2. The action taken or inaction by an authorized official is later determined
             to be an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.
             18.32.3.1.3. The personnel action is the subject of a review by an appropriate
             authority, on its own initiative, or because of a timely appeal, grievance, or claim
             against the NAFI by an employee, or former employee.
             18.32.3.1.4. The appropriate authority, has determined that an unjustified or
             unwarranted personnel action is to be corrected, consistent with applicable law or
             regulation.
         18.32.3.2. It must be clearly established that but for the unjustified or unwarranted
         personnel action, the employee would actually have been entitled to receive the pay,
         allowances, benefits, or differentials that are in question. For example, if an employee
         alleges the improper denial of a promotion, and the appropriate authority finds that a
         nondiscretionary provision had been violated, the employee would not be eligible for
         back pay had the employee been only one of several qualified candidates for the
         promotion, and the facts were not clearly established that the employee would have been
         selected.
         18.32.3.3. An NAF-HR may direct back pay on its own initiative upon acknowledging
         and correcting the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.
         18.32.3.4. The following information describes the types of action that may be corrected
         in which the employee is entitled to back pay. It is not intended to be all inclusive and
         NAF-HRs must carefully review every situation in which back pay may be an issue and
         determine if the criteria is met.
             18.32.3.4.1. Restoration. An employee who is ordered to be restored to active duty,
             but who resigns before actually returning to duty, is still entitled to back pay since
             there is no requirement that the employee must return to duty.
             18.32.3.4.2. Retroactive Promotions.
                 18.32.3.4.2.1. If a nondiscretionary provision is violated and the appropriate
                 authority, consistent with applicable law and regulations, determines that an
                 unjustified or unwarranted personnel action has taken place, and that, but for this
                 violation, the employee would have been promoted, an employee is to be placed
                 in the already existing higher graded position retroactively, upon correction of the
                 personnel action, and paid back pay.
                 18.32.3.4.2.2. A delay in a promotion action is not an unjustified or unwarranted
                 personnel action if nothing in the record indicates there was an administrative
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   275


             intention on the part of management to promote the employee on a specified date,
             presuming of course that the NAF-HR did not fail to carry out a nondiscretionary
             regulation or policy.
             18.32.3.4.2.3. Usually, a personnel action may not be effected retroactively so as
             to increase the right of an employee to compensation. However, an exception to
             this rule occurs where, through administrative error or clerical error, a personnel
             action was not effected as originally intended or where nondiscretionary
             requirements have not been carried out.
             18.32.3.4.2.4. Those terms and conditions of a collective bargaining agreement
             must be complied with. If the agreement, for example, specified that a higher
             grade position would be filled on a detail basis for a specific number of days, after
             which a temporary promotion would be effected, and this nondiscretionary
             provision is violated, the employee would be entitled to the temporary promotion
             on a retroactive basis and to back pay, if he or she met the qualifications for the
             higher grade position.
             18.32.3.4.2.5. A qualified employee who is detailed beyond the time limit for a
             detail to a higher grade or pay band position is entitled to retroactive temporary
             promotion, with back pay, beginning with the first day of the first pay period
             following the end of the time limit for the detail.
             18.32.3.4.2.6. An employee was not given priority consideration according to this
             regulation. It was determined that, if the employee had been given such priority
             consideration, he or she would have been selected for promotion. Therefore, the
             employee is entitled to retroactive promotion with pay. Priority consideration in
             itself does not guarantee promotion.
             18.32.3.4.2.7. The reclassification of a position is to be considered prospective,
             except to the extent that a retroactive promotion is provided for under
             classification appeal regulations. This is to be distinguished from improper
             details to higher graded positions.
         18.32.3.4.3. Retroactive Appointment. An employee, who at the time of
         appointment is assigned to a lower grade than the grade to which he or she should
         have been assigned had there not been an administrative failure to carry out a
         nondiscretionary provision, may have his or her appointment retroactively changed to
         the higher grade and paid back pay.
         18.32.3.4.4. Classification Actions. Usually, an employee is entitled only to the
         salary of the position to which he or she is actually appointed, regardless of the duties
         he or she performs. When, through the addition of duties, an employee performs at a
         grade or pay band level higher than the grade or pay band he or she holds, he or she is
         not entitled to the salary of the higher position, unless and until he or she is successful
         in obtaining reclassification of his or her position and promotion to the higher grade
         or pay band. (This situation is to be distinguished from improper details to higher
         grade or pay band positions).
  18.32.4. Installation Initiated Determination.           Installation commanders and their
  designees should take action, or direct that action be taken at any time, but within the statute
276                                                        AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      of limitation, to correct erroneous actions that resulted in the withdrawal, reduction, or denial
      of pay, allowances, benefits, or differentials that come to their attention.
      18.32.5. Determining the Period for Which Recomputation is Due. The period for which
      recomputation is required is the period covered by the unjustified or unwarranted personnel
      action that is corrected. It may not extend beyond the date of the employee's death or the
      date on which the employee would, except for the unjustified personnel action, have been
      properly separated. Do not include in this determination any period during which the
      employee was not available for the performance of duties because of incapacitating illness or
      injury, or any period during which the employee was unavailable for performance of his or
      her duties, for reasons other than those related to, or caused by the separation action.
      However, if the employee can establish that a period of incapacitation was the result of off-
      the-job injury or illness, the NAF-HR approves the employee's request for any annual or sick
      leave available to the employee for the period of incapacitation.
      18.32.6. Computing the Amount of Back Pay.
         18.32.6.1. The NAF-HR and the payroll liaison recompute, for the period covered by the
         corrected personnel action, pay, allowances, benefits, differentials and leave of the
         employee as if the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action had not occurred, and the
         employee is considered as having worked for the NAFI in the period covered by the
         corrected action.
         18.32.6.2. In computing pay, allowances, benefits, differentials, and leave account, the
         NAF-HR and payroll liaison include the following:
             18.32.6.2.1. Premium pay that the employee would have received had it not been for
             the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.
             18.32.6.2.2. Changes in pay rates by reasons of wage surveys, administrative action,
             law, or other changes of general application.
             18.32.6.2.3. Changes in allowances or differentials.
             18.32.6.2.4. WGIs or other periodic increases that would otherwise have become
             due.
             18.32.6.2.5. Changes in pay caused by changes in assigned working shifts.
             18.32.6.2.6. Changes in the employee's leave earning rate.
             18.32.6.2.7. Any other changes that would affect the amount of pay, allowances,
             differentials, benefits, or leave that the employee would have earned had it not been
             for the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.
         18.32.6.3. Back pay includes pay, allowances, differentials, and benefits for the period of
         the unwarranted or unjustified personnel action. It is computed at the basic rate of pay of
         the grade or pay band, step, or retained pay, and shift received on the effective date of the
         action. It is then adjusted by any new or revised NAF wage or salary schedules, and any
         WGIs that would have taken effect during the period of the unwarranted personnel action,
         as if the action had not occurred. This rate is then multiplied by the total number of hours
         actually worked each week. In cases of separation or suspension, the number of hours to
         be used is the number of hours that would have been scheduled and worked, but for the
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                    277


       unwarranted personnel action (determined by extending the previous work schedule). If
       the employee's work hours varied, the number of hours to be used is determined by
       averaging the total number of hours worked during the 26week period, just before the
       date of the separation.
       18.32.6.4. Determining total pay from other earnings (gross pay from other
       employment).
           18.32.6.4.1. This is the gross amount of earnings from other employment, before
           deduction of any amounts, such as income taxes, FICA, etc.
NOTE: Employment expenses, such as hotel, restaurant, travel, and other expenses incurred
during the successful appeal of a separation, are not authorized as credits to compensation or as
debits against earnings from other employment. Neither is the excess cost of living at the place
of interim employment over what the cost would have been at the former employment place
authorized.
           18.32.6.4.2. The amount of back pay due is reduced by any amount earned through
           "other employment" during a period of separation or suspension. A weekly or daily
           comparison of the back pay with the employee's outside earnings may be made, but is
           not required. The total amount of outside earnings is compared with the total amount
           of back pay otherwise due.
               18.32.6.4.2.1. Other employment is only that employment engaged in by the
               employee to take the place of the employment from which the employee was
               separated.
               18.32.6.4.2.2. If the employee was engaged in outside part-time employment
               before the separation, this part-time employment does not constitute other
               employment and is not deductible from the gross back pay, except for any
               increase in pay due to additional hours having been worked.
               18.32.6.4.2.3. Only pay received for employment beyond the pay previously
               received from the parttime employment would be set off against back pay due.
               18.32.6.4.2.4. Acceptable evidence of salary or wages earned in other
               employment includes such documents as a memorandum from the employer
               giving dates of employment and gross pay; payroll slips and check stubs.
           18.32.6.4.3. Separated employees are obligated to make good faith efforts, as
           determined by the NAF-HR, to secure gainful employment during the period of
           separation, while contesting the separation action. Employees should be advised to
           keep strict records of their earnings while the separation action is in effect. Failure to
           seek gainful employment, without good cause, may result in lesser or no back
           entitlement. Acceptable evidence of an employee's efforts to secure gainful
           employment includes documents used by an employment agency to show that the
           employee had requested employment, was referred or not referred, letters of non-
           selection, and so forth.
       18.32.6.5. Authorized Deductions.
           18.32.6.5.1. In the case of a regular employee who was taking part in the retirement
           plan at the time of the unwarranted personnel action, the amount of employee and
278                                                        AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


             employing NAFI contributions required, had that action not occurred, must be paid.
             This is because the employee is entitled to credited service, for retirement program
             purposes, for the period of the unwarranted personnel action. The required
             retroactive employee contributions are computed and deducted from the employee's
             gross back pay before subtracting earnings from other employment. If little or no
             back pay is due the employee because of excessive other earnings, the amount of
             contributions owed must be paid either in a lump sum by the employee or deducted,
             as soon as possible, from future salary or wage payments.
             18.32.6.5.2. In the case of a regular employee who was taking part in the group life
             or group health insurance program at the time of the unwarranted personnel action,
             the amount of employee and employing NAFI contributions required, had the
             unwarranted or unjustified personnel action not occurred, must be paid. The required
             retroactive employee contributions are computed and deducted from the employee's
             gross back pay before subtracting any earnings from other employment. If little or no
             back pay is due the employee because of excessive other earnings, the amount of
             contributions owed must be paid either in a lump sum by the employee or deducted,
             as soon as possible, from future salary or wage payments. If, in a separation action,
             the employee refuses to make the required retroactive contributions, coverage
             terminates, as of the effective date of the unwarranted separation. In such an event,
             the employee cannot again take part in the group life and health insurance program
             until evidence of insurability, satisfactory to the insurance carrier, is furnished for all
             eligible family members.
             18.32.6.5.3. FICA deductions are not computed on gross back pay. Earnings from
             other employment, if any, must be deducted from the gross amount of back pay due
             and FICA deductions withheld on the balance due. The FICA tax computed is
             subject to the limitations of the maximum tax liability of the current year.
             18.32.6.5.4. Federal, state and local income taxes are computed at current rates and
             deducted from the balance due the employee, after deducting earnings from other
             employment, in the same manner as FICA deductions.
         18.32.6.6. The unemployment compensation an employee receives from a state during a
         period of unwarranted separation from a NAFI is usually required to be refunded to the
         state; therefore, no deduction is to be made from the back pay to which the employee is
         otherwise entitled on restoration. NAF Payroll Liaison must inform the proper state
         employment security agency that the employee is being restored to duty, with retroactive
         pay and benefits and an adjustment for earnings received from other employment.
         18.32.6.7. Net pay due is determined by subtracting the employee's gross earnings from
         other employment from the gross back pay due, and then deducting authorized
         deductions as shown in paragraph 18.32.6.5. In no case will the employee be given more
         pay, allowance, differential, and benefits than he or she would have been entitled to had
         the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action not occurred.
      18.32.7. Recredit of Leave.
         18.32.7.1. Sick Leave. Accrued sick leave on record as of the date of a separation is
         recredited to the employee's sick leave account by the AFSVA SSC and is available for
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  279


      immediate use, if needed. Sick leave the employee would have earned during the period
      of unwarranted or unjustified separation or suspension is also credited to the employee's
      account. If a former DoD NAF employee returns to DoD NAF employment after a
      separation related to a BBA, his or her sick leave balance at the time of such separation
      shall be restored.
      18.32.7.2. Annual Leave. An employee may opt to repay the NAF Payroll Liaison all, or
      a portion of, the lump sum annual leave payment made on separation, except any amount
      that would be in excess of the number of hours allowed to be carried over to the next
      leave year. If repaid, this leave is available for immediate use as necessary. Annual
      leave the employee would have earned during the period of separation or suspension is
      also credited to the employee's leave account record by the NAF Payroll Liaison. Any
      leave in excess of 240 hours (360 hours if in a foreign area) must be used before the end
      of the leave year or lost.
   18.32.8. Effecting the Correction. The action is corrected by cancelling the AF Form 2545
   that effected the unwarranted or unjustified personnel action. In a separation action, indicate
   in the remarks section of the corrective action the date set by the NAF-HR as the date of the
   employee's return to active duty and his or her actual return to duty date; the date of the
   employee's death; or the date on which the employee would, except for the unjustified
   separation action, have been properly separated. All copies of the unjustified or unwarranted
   personnel action are destroyed.
   18.32.9. Employee Representative Notification. An employee's designated representative,
   if any, will, upon authorization of the employee, be provided a copy of payroll, leave, and
   personnel action documents, if the employee's restoration was directed as a result of a bona
   fide grievance, negotiated agreement, or civil court action.
18.33. Order of Precedence and Designation of Beneficiary.
   18.33.1. Order of Precedence (Persons Entitled). Payment of any unpaid compensation
   (pay and lump sum leave payment) due on the death of an employee is made to the person or
   persons who survive the insured and who are entitled under the following order of
   precedence:
      18.33.1.1. First, to the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries.
      18.33.1.2. Second, if there is no designated beneficiary, to the widow or widower.
      18.33.1.3. Third, if neither of the above, to the child or children in equal shares, with the
      share of any deceased child distributed among those descendants of that child by
      representation.
      18.33.1.4. Fourth, if none of the above, to the parents in equal shares or the entire
      amount to the surviving parent.
      18.33.1.5. Fifth, if none of the above, to the legal representative of the estate.
      18.33.1.6. Sixth, if none of the above, to the next of kin, as determined under the laws of
      the state in which the employee was domiciled.
   18.33.2. Designation of Beneficiary.
280                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      18.33.2.1. Designation Not Mandatory. A specific designation of a beneficiary is not
      necessary if the order of precedence for payment of unpaid compensation in paragraph
      18.33.1 is satisfactory to the employee. A designation is made, however, if the employee
      wishes to name as a beneficiary some person, firm, corporation, or other legal entity not
      stipulated in the order of precedence, or in a different order. Also, filing a designation is
      advisable if evidence of a valid marriage is not readily available. This includes instances
      in which the employee does not have and cannot easily secure a certificate of a
      ceremonial marriage or evidence of death or divorce dissolving a prior marriage.
      18.33.2.2. Advice to the Employee. When an employee is hired, the NAF-HR informs
      the employee that any unpaid compensation must be paid in the order of precedence,
      unless he or she completes a designation of beneficiary and files it with the servicing
      NAF-HR. The employee is also advised that termination of AF NAF employment at the
      installation by transfer from the installation, transfer to a nonAF NAFI, or by resignation
      from the NAFI invalidates a designation of beneficiary. (Employment terminated with
      one AF NAFI on an installation and employment in another AF NAFI on the same
      installation does not invalidate the designation.) An individual previously employed on
      the installation must, on reemployment, also be told that any designation of beneficiary
      previously filed is no longer valid. Each installation NAF-HR from time to time reminds
      employees that changes in family status without a corresponding change in designation or
      cancellation of beneficiary may result in a settlement other than that desired.
      18.33.2.3. Designation Form. Use SF 1152, Designation of Beneficiary, Unpaid
      Compensation of Deceased Civilian Employee, in establishing a beneficiary for unpaid
      compensation. The form contains instructions for completion and illustration of the most
      common types of designations.
      18.33.2.4. Unacceptable Designations. Designations containing miscellaneous
      provisions, such as payment of just debts, to John if he is living at home, to John if he
      uses the money for education purposes, cannot be accepted by the NAF-HR. Neither can
      a common disaster clause inserted in a designation be recognized as binding. Should an
      employee want the money paid only to a beneficiary who services the employee by some
      specified purpose, he or she may name his or her estate as beneficiary and stipulate in a
      will the particular conditions or restrictions the executor is to follow in handling the
      payment.
      18.33.2.5. Review and Disposition. After making sure that the SF 1152 is properly
      completed, signed and witnessed, the original is retained by the servicing NAF-HR and a
      copy is returned to the employee.
   18.33.3. Changing or Cancelling Designations.
      18.33.3.1. Change or Cancellation by Employee. An employee has the right to cancel
      or change his or her designation of beneficiary at any time without the knowledge or
      consent of any previous beneficiary. This right cannot be waived or restricted.
      18.33.3.2. Automatic Cancellation. Unless cancelled or changed by the employee, a
      designation of beneficiary continues in effect until it is automatically cancelled under
      those circumstances indicated below:
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                            281


        18.33.3.2.1. On the day the employee transfers to another installation. (Transfer
        from one AF NAFI to another AF NAFI on the same installation does not invalidate
        the designation.)
        18.33.3.2.2. On the day the employee transfers to a nonAF NAFI on the same
        installation.
        18.33.3.2.3. On the day the employee resigns or ceases employment at the
        installation (except in the case of the employee's death).
     18.33.3.3. Filing of Designation. SF 1152, when completed, is filed on the right side of
     the OPF.
     18.33.3.4. Filing a Claim. Use SF 1153, Claim for Unpaid Compensation of Deceased
     Civilian Employee, for filing a claim for unpaid compensation due on the death of the
     employee.
282                                                     AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011

   19.6.2. Management must establish and fill a sufficient number of CY positions to ensure
   compliance with applicable staffing levels based on the youth/child ratios.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                285


19.6.3. Supervisors establish CY-03 positions at the full performance target level when possible.
If qualified applicants are not available, management restructures CY-03 positions to the CY-01
or CY-02 training level as required. Employees hired at the CY-01 and 02 levels are non-
competitively promoted to the CY-03 after completion of training and qualification
requirements.
19.6.4. Supervisors establish CY-04 and 05 positions at the full performance level. In situations
where CY-04 and 05 employees are not available, CY -03 room leads may complete most
tasking with management oversight. Refer to paragraph 19.8.2 of this guide for additional
guidance in filling CY-04 and 05 positions.
19.7. Staffing and Recruitment. When filling positions, supervisors and NAF-HRs ensure
compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the AF NAF and CY system.
Supervisors ensure candidates meet minimum qualification requirements, and observe applicant
preference entitlements outlined in Chapter 3, (i.e., Military Spouse Preference, THP, Veterans
Preference, etc.). Supervisors and NAF-HRs also ensure selected candidates satisfactorily
complete all employment requirements within required time-lines, i.e., physical examinations,
IRCs and other investigative requirements.
19.8. Filling Positions.
   19.8.1. Management fills CY-03 and above positions at the full performance level when
   qualified applicants are available. Applicants must meet the qualification requirements of the
   position.
       19.8.1.1. When there are no qualified applicants at the CY-03 target level, supervisors
       may fill a developmental CY-02 intermediate level position that is targeted to the CY-03
       target level position. The CY-02 intermediate level employee is trained and non-
       competitively promoted within two pay periods of meeting the qualification requirements
       of the full performance CY-1702-03 target level position.
       19.8.1.2. When there are no qualified applicants at the CY-03 target level and the CY-02
       intermediate level, supervisors may fill a developmental CY-01 entry level position that
       is targeted to the CY-03 target level. The CY-01 entry-level employee is trained and
       non-competitively reassigned within two pay periods of meeting the qualifications of a
       CY-02 intermediate level position. Training continues and the CY-02 intermediate level
       employee is non-competitively promoted within two pay periods of meeting the
       qualifications of the full performance CY-03 target level position.
       19.8.1.3. Permanent promotions are competitive actions unless:
       The promotion is the result of job growth;

       The promotion is the result of improper classification;

       The promotion is required to comply with a new classification standard; or

       The promotion follows competitive assignment to a developmental position.
   19.8.2. Management fills CY-04 and 05 positions at the full performance level. If no
   qualified applicants are available, supervisors may provide lower level employees with the
   training to qualify for CY-04 or 05 positions. Management may temporarily detail lower

      level employees to the CY-04 or 05 positions. Guidance for official details is outlined in
      Chapter 5.
19.9. Application Procedures. In addition to the employment application, applicants applying
for positions involving contact with children under age 18 must complete:
A Supplemental Continuation Page containing information specified and in the format shown in
Figure 4.1.

An Acknowledgment of Rights and Consent to Release Information form containing information
and in the format shown in Attachment 25.
   19.9.1. NAF-HRs advise applicants they must provide proof of age and high school
   graduation (or equivalent) upon selection for a CY position.
19.10. Qualifications. Supervisors and NAF-HRs ensure candidates meet specific qualification
requirements as reflected on the applicable SPG. The following paragraphs assist supervisors
and NAF-HRs in interpreting and applying these qualification requirements. Table 19.1 outlines
the qualification requirements for CY Program Assistant positions.
   19.10.1. Evaluating Experience. When evaluating whether an applicant has the required
   amount and level of experience, keep the following points in mind:
         19.10.1.1. Creditable experience is experience of the type, level, and amount specified in
         the appropriate HQ AFSVA SPG that equipped the candidate to satisfactorily perform
         duties and responsibilities of the position being filled. Candidates may gain this
         experience through federal or nonfederal employment, volunteer work, work-study, or
         other similar types of situations.
         19.10.1.2. Qualification requirements specify a certain amount of qualifying experience
         be at a level of difficulty and responsibility equivalent to the next lower grade. In
         evaluating non-federal experience, make a comparison of the description of duties and
         responsibilities described on the employment application with those described on the
         SPGs and other federal positions and make a grade equivalency determination.
             19.10.1.2.1. Qualifying experience may include experience involving direct contact
             with children in an organized program such as, child development, early childhood
             education, home economics (early childhood emphasis), elementary education,
             special education or other fields appropriate to the position to be filled. This may
             include day care, school, day camp, family day care, preschool, nursery school, or a
             similar type program. May also include experience as a group leader, counselor, or
             similar work in public and private programs for youth/children including but not
             limited to summer camps, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Young Women’s
             Christian Association (YWCA) and Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA)
             clubs, 4-H programs, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, urban community centers, or resort
             recreational activities. Family day care experience must have been gained in a
             licensed or certified family day care home.

Notes:
1. Applicant must possess basic requirement, experience and training; OR basic requirement and
education.

2. Those individuals who occupied SAP CY-04 positions prior to the October 2008 issuance of
the revised guidance are grandfathered for their current installation only.


         19.10.1.3. Supervisors should not use salary or military rank alone to determine the level
         of an applicant’s experience. Give the same credit for experience where the applicant
         received little or no pay as for comparable paid experience.
         19.10.1.4. As specified in para 19.10.1.1, qualifying experience does not necessarily
         mean the experience must have been obtained in a DoD CY program. Supervisors may
         place applicants having qualifying non-federal experience into positions when they meet
         all the other requirements for that grade level. For example, a CY-01 employee with 6
         months non-federal experience (otherwise appropriate to the position being filled) may be
         moved to a CY-02 level as soon as they satisfy all the training or educational
         requirements for that level even though they may not have been employed in the CDC,
         SAP, or YP for 6 months.
   19.10.2. Evaluating Education:
         19.10.2.1. High School Diploma. All CY positions require high school graduation (or
         equivalent). High school graduation or equivalent means the applicant has received a
         high school diploma, General Education Development (GED) equivalency certificate, or
         proficiency certificate from a State, Country, or territorial-level Board or Department of
         Education. NAF-HRs verify high school graduation or GED equivalency of applicants
         selected for CY positions prior to appointment. The applicant may satisfy this
         requirement by providing proof of education above the high school level as defined in
         paragraph 19.10.2.2. NAF-HRs obtain a copy of the high school diploma/GED
         certificate or proof of education above the high school level, document verification in the
         OPF, and forward the copy to the director for retention. The copy of the high school
         diploma is not filed in the OPF.
            19.10.2.1.1. If applicants are unable to obtain proof of high school graduation (or
            equivalent) this requirement may be satisfied if the applicant certifies in writing that
            she/he completed the academic requirements (equivalent of high school education)
            before a notary public, or other cognizant official. NAF-HRs may use this alternate
            certification only in cases where all other efforts to obtain proof of high school
            graduation (or equivalency) have been exhausted. Examples where this is appropriate
            include situations where high school records were destroyed due to fire, natural
            disaster, etc.
            19.10.2.1.2. When a foreign high school diploma equivalent is submitted, the
            applicant must certify in writing, before a notary public or other cognizant official,
            that she/he completed the academic requirements equivalent of an American high
            school education. For OCONUS bases, this certification must be notarized by the
            base legal office.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   289


     19.10.2.2. Some CY positions have a positive education requirement, e.g., a requirement
     for a minimum amount of education, while others allow education above the high school
     level to substitute for required training and/or experience. Education above the high
     school level is successfully completed progressive study at an accredited business or
     technical school, junior college, college, or university where the institution normally
     requires a high school diploma or equivalent for admission. Use the following guidelines
     to evaluate education possessed by the applicant or employee:
        19.10.2.2.1. It is the applicant’s responsibility to provide documentation or proof he
        or she met the applicable educational provisions described on the SPG. An official
        transcript; statement from the institution’s registrar, dean, or other appropriate
        official; or equivalent documentation is required.
        19.10.2.2.2. To be qualifying, education must meet one of the following criteria:
        Conventional At the time the applicant obtained the education, the entire institution,
        applicable school within the institution, or the applicable curriculum was
        appropriately accredited by an accrediting organization recognized by the Secretary,
        U.S. Department of Education. The Directory of Postsecondary Institutions, U.S.
        Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics list institutions
        accredited by these organizations.

        Other Education Other education (e.g., foreign education, home study and
        correspondence courses, academic credit for work experience, military education,
        continuing education units, life experience, etc.) is acceptable to the extent it is
        determined to be equivalent to conventional higher education programs of U.S.
        institutions. Such education must meet one of the following provisions:

        The specific courses have been accepted for college-level credit by an accredited U.S.
        college or university because they would be creditable if the student were to further
        his or her education at that institution.

        The academic credit earned through a special credit program such as the College
        Level Examination Program (CLEP) has been awarded by an accredited college,
        university, or institution.

        Credit for home study course work has been granted by a post secondary institution
        accredited by the National Home Study Council.

        An accredited U.S. state university reports the other institution as one whose
        transcript is given full value, or full value is given in subject areas applicable to the
        curricula at the state university.

        The applicant has submitted education completed outside the U.S. to a private
        organization specializing in interpretation of foreign educational credentials and the
        organization deemed that education equivalent to that gained in conventional U.S.
        education programs. The Council on Postsecondary Accreditation may be of some
        help in providing information on these organizations.

      19.10.2.2.3. Related Education is education above the high school level that
      equipped the applicant with the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA)s to
      successfully perform duties of the position being filled. Education must be
      appropriate for the specific position being filled. Directly related courses and
      subjects mean: Courses or subjects that typically meet core requirements for a major
      in the field, i.e., child development, early childhood education, youth development,
      youth recreation, etc. Do not give credit for courses and subjects typically used to
      meet general education requirements for a degree that is not specific to children or
      youth. If in doubt about a course, consult the titles of the training modules for Child
      Development Assistant, School Age Assistant, Youth Program Assistant, or Family
      Child Care Air Force CY Certification. These modules outline the subject matter for
      which credit should be given.
         19.10.2.2.3.1. Directly related majors include child development, youth
         recreation, elementary/early childhood education, child psychology, family
         services, social work, or home economics and art education, music education,
         theater, youth development and physical education if they included content and
         experience related to children or youth. Directly related courses and subjects in
         child development, early childhood education or elementary education usually
         includes ―child‖ or ―early childhood education‖ in their title. Examples include
         child nutrition, child growth and development, music in early childhood
         programs, art for the young child, and administration of early childhood
         programs. Credit is earned for parent education and the family relationship even
         though they do not have the words child or early childhood education in their
         titles. Credit is not earned for general education courses not directly related to
         children or youth, such as, sociology, English 101, etc.
      19.10.2.2.4. Education And Experience Gained Concurrently. When an applicant
      gains qualifying education and experience, give credit for each based on the time
      spent and merit of each. In many instances, supervised experience is required as part
      of an academic curriculum or course work. An applicant cannot receive full credit for
      this supervised experience, as experience, since practical experience is integral to the
      educational curriculum. The applicant can, however, receive full credit for
      supervised experience that was not considered as part of the qualifying education.
      19.10.2.2.5. Substituting Experience for Education. On rare occasions, an applicant
      not meeting the exact positive educational requirements for a specific position may be
      demonstrably well qualified to perform the work of the position because of
      exceptional experience or a combination of education, experience, and training.
      Substitute a combination of education, experience, and training for a positive
      educational requirement when it is equivalent to successful completion of a 4-year
      course of college study appropriate to the position being filled. This substitution is
      authorized under the following circumstances:
      The applicant submits a ―portfolio‖ consisting of, and containing information
      specified in Attachment 26 of this guidance. This ―portfolio‖ describes
      qualifications that emphasize strengths and leadership in Child Development, Early
      Childhood Education, or Youth Recreation/Education/Development, and clearly
      demonstrates exceptional qualifications.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                291



         The applicant possesses a minimum of 24 college semester hours (or equivalent)
         equivalent to a major in a related field. Upper-level courses are particularly important
         because they show intensive study equivalent to a major course of study.

         A panel consisting of the Child Development/Youth Director, NAF-HR, and Airman
         & Family Services Flight Chief reviews the portfolio and determines the applicant’s
         entire background, e.g., education, training, professional achievements, and
         experience is comparable to successful completion of a 4-year course of college study
         appropriate to the position being filled.

         The Force Support Commander/Director approves the panel recommendation.
            19.10.2.2.5.1. In cases where education, training, and experience are substituted
            for a positive education requirement the supervisor maintains approval
            documentation and the supporting portfolio in the Supervisor’s Employee Work
            Folder. The NAF-HR documents the substitution and approval in block 28 of the
            AF Form 2548, NAFI Request for Personnel Action.
  19.10.3. Evaluating Training. SPGs describe the minimum training requirement, e.g.,
  modules, that the applicant/employee must meet to qualify for a position. These
  requirements may be satisfied as follows:
     19.10.3.1. Air Force CDC, SAP, YP, and/or Family Child Care training modules are
     equivalent and may be substituted between programs to satisfy the qualification and
     training requirements for CY positions in the different programs. The Training and
     Curriculum Specialist documents the completed modules on the AF Form 1098, Special
     Task Certification and Recurring Training and forwards the form to the NAF-HR for
     inclusion in the OPF.
     19.10.3.2. Completed CDC, SAP, YP, and/or Family Child Care modules from other
     DoD components (i.e., Army, Navy, Marines) may be substituted for AF modules. The
     Training and Curriculum Specialist reviews the modules, and certifies their equivalency
     on the AF Form 1098. DoD modules certified as AF equivalent satisfy the qualification
     and training requirements for AF CY positions. The Training and Curriculum Specialist
     forwards the AF Form 1098 to the NAF-HR for inclusion in the employee’s OPF.
     19.10.3.3. Substitute education above the high school level for completion of AF
     modules on a case-by-case basis. NAF-HRs use information contained in paragraph
     19.10.2 of this guidance to make this determination. Program Directors, and training and
     curriculum specialists, are available to assist the NAF-HR in making this determination.
     19.10.3.4. Flexible employees who work on a seasonal basis must make satisfactory
     progress towards completion of training modules based on the actual number of months
     they were actively working.
  19.10.4. Medical Qualifications. Specific functional requirements, environmental factors,
  and other medical qualification requirements for CY positions are identified on the sample
  Optional Form (OF) 178, Certificate of Medical Examination, at Attachment 27. Prior to
  appointment, applicants selected for CY positions must undergo and satisfactorily complete,
292                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      a physical examination and any tests recommended by the program medical advisor to
      include at a minimum the elements identified on the OF 178. In addition to the initial pre-
      employment physical examination, Program Directors ensure their staff has a physical
      examination every 3 years and any tests recommended by the program medical advisor. All
      staff and volunteers must have the immunizations required by AF Joint Instruction 48110,
      Immunizations and Chemoprophylaxis and AFI 48-105, Surveillance, Prevention, and
      Control of Diseases and Conditions of Public Health or Military Significance. Results are
      maintained in the employee work folder.
         19.10.4.1. If circumstances prevent completion of the physical prior to appointment, the
         applicant may be appointed provided the physical is satisfactorily completed during the
         first 60 days of employment. Satisfactory completion of the physical must be made a
         condition of employment as outlined in paragraph 19.17. Selected applicants who have
         had a physical within 3 months prior to employment may use this physical as long as it
         includes the required elements for CY positions.
         19.10.4.2. The NAF-HR will inform all selected applicants of the required physical
         elements of the position for which they were selected and inquire if they have had a
         physical within the past 3 months that meets these required elements.
             19.10.4.2.1. If the selectee advises he/she has not had a physical in the past 3 months
             that meets the required elements, a pre-employment physical is scheduled for the
             selected applicant. The selected applicant completes and signs part A of the OF 178.
             The NAF-HR completes part B of the OF 178 and gives the form to the examining
             physician. The physician conducts a physical examination based on the required
             elements outlined on the OF 178, completes page 2, and parts C, D, and F, signs and
             returns to the NAF-HR, either the entire completed form, or at a minimum, page 3 of
             the form. The NAF-HR reviews the physician’s recommendations and determines
             whether the employee meets the physical requirements of the position and completes
             part E of the OF 178.
             19.10.4.2.2. If the selectee claims to have had a physical in the past 3 months that
             meets the required elements, the selectee completes and signs part A of the OF 178.
             The NAF-HR completes part B of the OF 178 and provides the form to the selectee
             along with an envelope pre-addressed to the NAF-HR and marked as containing
             confidential, medical information. The selectee provides the form and envelope to
             the physician who completed his/her prior physical. Based on the results of the
             previous physical, the physician completes page 2, and parts C, D, and F, of the OF
             178 and returns the form to the selectee sealed in the pre-addressed envelope. The
             selectee presents the sealed envelope to the NAF-HR who reviews the physician’s
             recommendation. Based on this recommendation, the NAF-HR determines whether
             the employee meets the physical requirements of the position, completes part E of the
             OF 178.
             19.10.4.2.3. If the physician returns the entire completed OF 178 to the NAF-HR and
             it contains medical information about the employee, the form is filed in the
             Employee’s Medical Folder. If the physician returns only page 3 of the OF 178,
             which does not contain medical information, the form is filed in the envelope on the
             right side of the OPF. Receipt of physical, and results of medical suitability review
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 293


           are documented by NAF-HR on Managerial Checklist for CY Positions (Attachment
           28) and forwarded to Child or Youth Program activity manager.
19.11. Age. Prior to appointment, NAF-HRs verify that selectees for CY positions are at least
18 years of age. Acceptable verifying documents include valid state driver’s license, birth
certificate, passport, or other government issued Identification (ID) Card. that provides proof of
age. NAF-HRs record age verification in the OPF. Documents used to verify age are not copied
or filed in the OPF.
19.12. Investigative Requirements. Installations comply with requirements of Public Law
101-647, Section 231, Crime Control Act of 1990; DoDI 1402.5, Criminal History Background
Checks on Individuals in Child Care Services; and HSPD-12, Policy for a Common
Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors. Installations use these
references and Chapter 4 of this guidance to ensure compliance with all legal and regulatory
requirements.
19.13. Probationary Period. All newly appointed CY employees must complete a 12month
probationary period as required by Chapter 4.
19.14. Dual Employment in CDCs. Employees will not hold both a NAF and APF position
within the CDC. Those employees holding both APF and NAF positions on 26 Oct 93, and who
have been continuously employed in those positions, are grandfathered. This provision does not
prohibit CDC APF employees from holding a NAF position in another activity including the
SAP.
19.15. Dual Compensation and Employment Law. CY employees are subject to Dual
Compensation and Employment restrictions specified in Chapter 3 and Title 5 U.S.C., Section
5533(a). Employees may occupy two positions on one position guide. Example: An employee
can be in a CY position in CDC and in a CY position in YP, different positions and different
activities. These are dual employees, with two separate timecards, possibly two different salary
rates, whose timesheets are processed the same as an employee who works both in the Officer’s
Club during the day and the Bowling Center at night.
19.16. Training Requirements.
   19.16.1. CY-01 or 02 level employees must satisfactorily complete, as a condition of
   employment, the following training:
       19.16.1.1. AF Orientation, minimum of three modules, first aid certification training and
       cardiopulmonary resuscitation (as applicable) within the first 6 months of employment
       19.16.1.2. Minimum of three modules every 3 months, after fulfilling the initial 6 month
       training requirement
       19.16.1.3. All modules within 18 months of employment at tables 19.2 and 19.3.

AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  295


19.17. Conditions of Employment. Satisfactory completion of all required training as outlined
in paragraph 19.16 above, completion of background checks, and completion of an employment
physical within 60 days of appointment are all conditions of employment. Employees not
meeting these requirements are terminated from NAF employment.
   19.17.1. If circumstances beyond the control of the employee prevent the employee from
   completing the training modules within the required time frame, the Airman and Family
   Services Flight Chief, may approve a written extension. Supervisors consult with the NAF-
   HR and use procedures in Chapter 8 to involuntarily separate an employee.
19.18. Transporting Children. This guidance applies to all positions that involve
responsibility for transporting youth regardless of whether this is a primary or incidental duty.
Compliance with existing motor vehicle operator guidance contained in AFI 34204, Property
Management, Chapter 6 and AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, is required. According to AFI 34-
249, Youth Programs, para 2.2.4.5, all persons transporting children must hold a valid driver’s
license and have a good driving record. A copy of their driver’s license and driving record
(obtained within the last 12 months) must be maintained on file.
   19.18.1. When a position involves responsibility for operating a motor vehicle to transport
   youth, the following actions are required:
       19.18.1.1. Supervisors ensure the official position description (PD) and/or position guide
       (PG) reflects specific motor vehicle operation duties, and relevant qualification and
       performance standards.      If necessary, supervisors initiate and submit PD/PG
       modifications to the NAF-HR. Following are examples of information to include on the
       PD/PG.
           19.18.1.1.1. Duties and Responsibilities. Include a description of the specific duties
           involved, type of vehicles(s) operated, and other information pertinent to the accurate
           classification of the position and important to qualification and performance
           standards.
           19.18.1.1.2. Qualifications. Reflect the requirement to possess a valid state driver’s
           license appropriate for the size and type of vehicle operated; the ability to operate a
           motor vehicle in a safe manner; and the requirement for individuals to provide a copy
           of their driving record.
           19.18.1.1.3. Performance Standards. Reflect performance expectations for motor
           vehicle operation duties, for example: complies with safety and traffic rules and
           regulations; operates the motor vehicle in a manner that minimizes violations due to
           employee error or negligence; avoids discomfort and injury to passengers and vehicle
           damage; has no more than one minor traffic violation, and no major violations due to
           his/her error or negligence per rating period.
   19.18.2. Upon application, the NAF-HR:
       19.18.2.1. Verifies possession of a valid driver’s license. The NAF-HR documents
       driver’s license number and expiration, and initials and dates this certification in Section
       F, Other Qualifications, portion of the employment application.
       19.18.2.2. Notifies applicant they must provide a copy of their driving record for the
       state in which licensed. Applicants are responsible for obtaining a copy of their driving
296                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      record at their own expense. The driving record must be no older than 12 months prior to
      the date of the application.
      19.18.2.3. Copies of state records are available at minimal charge at the state driver’s
      license issuing agency. When requesting records, applicants must request a complete
      driving record. Due to the length of time required to obtain a copy, applicants should
      request their driving records as far in advance as possible.
      19.18.2.4. Applicants located in foreign areas who possess a driver’s license issued by a
      military authority obtain copies of their driving records by submitting a written request to
      the appropriate security forces or military office. As an alternative, if an installation
      records check (IRC) is required, and if it includes a review of records at the location, the
      NAF-HR may request a review of driving records during completion of the IRC.
      19.18.2.5. Requires applicants complete a ―Continuation Page for Motor Vehicle
      Operator Positions at figure 19.1.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                             297

Signature                                       Date




    19.18.3. During the selection process, supervisors review the individual’s application and
    driving record to ensure there is no disqualifying information. Supervisors evaluate driving
    records using guidance contained in paragraph 19.19 of this chapter. Supervisors document
    satisfactory review of driving records by including the statement ―I have reviewed this
    individual’s driving record and there is no disqualifying information‖ on the employment
    application, and initialing and dating the certification. Supervisors return the certified copy
    of the employment application to the NAF-HR with selection paperwork, and file a copy of
    the driving record in the AF Form 971, Supervisors Record of Employee.
    19.18.4. In emergencies, supervisors may select and provisionally place individuals into a
    position pending receipt and review of official driving records, if there is no disqualifying
    information contained in the employment application and ―continuation page for motor
    vehicle operator positions.‖ In such instances, supervisors must obtain prior written approval
    from the Airman and Family Services Flight Chief, and employees may not operate a motor
    vehicle to transport youth until supervisors have satisfactorily reviewed the official driving
    record. When supervisors receive the official driving record, and when it contains
    disqualifying information, supervisors coordinate action with the NAF-HR to remove
    employees from their position, and/or NAF employment.
19.19. Evaluating driving records. To assess an individual’s ability to operate a vehicle in a
safe manner, supervisors evaluate the individual’s driving record, and consider the presence of
negative information. Supervisors coordinate with the NAF-HR prior to disqualifying
employees based on derogatory driving information. Supervisors also use guidance in HQ
AFSVA/SVX Program Training Aid HR-4, Making Suitability Determinations, 17 Sep 96, to
evaluate driving records and document their decisions. The presence of negative information, in
itself, does not necessarily demonstrate the inability to drive safely or disqualify
applicants/employees. The following serves as a guide to assess derogatory information and
determine the suitability of applicants for the position, however, supervisors must exercise sound
judgment and consider the individual merits of each case. Supervisors consider such factors as
seriousness, recency, and frequency of offenses, mitigating factors, and the relevance of this
information as it relates to the employee’s/applicant’s ability to operate the motor vehicle and
transport children or youth in a safe manner.
    19.19.1. Normally, individuals are disqualified from operating a motor vehicle to transport
    youth if their record reflects any of the following violations:
        19.19.1.1. Driving under the influence, or impaired by alcohol or a controlled substance,
        or refusal to undergo such testing as required by any jurisdiction;
        19.19.1.2. Leaving the scene of an accident;
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   299


       19.19.1.3. A violation of a state or local law on motor vehicle control (except a parking
       violation) involving a fatality or major property damage;
       19.19.1.4. Reckless driving;
       19.19.1.5. Has had a license suspended, revoked, or canceled for cause in the 3-year
       period ending on the date of application; or
       19.19.1.6. Any other similar offense.
   19.19.2. Normally, individuals are disqualified from operating a motor vehicle to transport
   children/youth if they committed two or more serious traffic violations within the past 3
   years. Individuals may be disqualified for one serious traffic violation if the particular merits
   of the case dictate. For purposes of these guidelines a serious traffic violation is defined as:
       19.19.2.1. Excessive speeding – an offense for exceeding the posted speed limit by 15
       miles per hour or more;
   19.19.2.2. Driving the wrong way;
   19.19.2.3. Failure to yield;
   19.19.2.4.   Improper or erratic traffic lane changes;
       19.19.2.5. Following a vehicle too closely; or
       19.19.2.6. Any other similar violation defined as serious by state or local law.
   19.19.3. Other violations (other than parking violations) not described above may be
   disqualifying depending on the type, number, and frequency.
19.20. Periodic Review of Driving Record and Offenses During Employment. Although not
required by AF guidelines, supervisors may require employees who transport children or youth
to provide a copy of their driving record on a periodic basis, e.g., every 6 months or year. If
required, supervisors identify the requirement in the official PD/PG. If employees are found
unsuitable to operate the motor vehicle because of offenses committed after appointment,
supervisors take immediate action to permanently or temporarily remove employees from duties
requiring operation of a motor vehicle. This may involve such action as movement to another
position, separation from NAF employment, or other action depending on the circumstances.
Supervisors consult with the NAF-HR on the appropriate action.
19.21. Investigative Requirements. The NAF-HR and supervisors comply with all
requirements of Public Law 101-647, Section 231, Crime Control Act of 1990; DoDI 1402.5,
Criminal History Background Checks on Individuals in Child Care Services; HSPD-12, Policy
for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors; and guidance
outlined in this chapter. Individuals selected for positions involving regular contact with
children under 18 must undergo an Installation Records Check (IRC), State Criminal History
Repository Check(s) (SCHRC(s)), and a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI). These
requirements apply to all applicants selected for CY positions regardless of the appointment
length or type. There is no authority to waive these background checks.
   19.21.1. Installations may provisionally hire an individual upon favorable completion of an
   IRC at the current Air Force installation. Additional IRCs at prior installations are completed
   immediately after the individual is appointed. NAF-HRs must initiate SCHRCs and a NACI
300                                                       AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      on or before the date of appointment. When SCHRCs and/or NACI are not complete prior to
      appointment, the NAF-HR and manager of the employing organization review the
      application and complete pre-employment reference checks. Pending satisfactory completion
      of the SCHRC(s), NACI, and/or IRCs at former installations, the selectee may be brought on
      the rolls under carefully regulated direct line of sight supervision of a staff person whose
      background checks are successfully complete. Use of video equipment is acceptable
      provided it is monitored by an individual who has successfully completed a background
      check. Favorable completion of all IRCs, SCHRCs and NACI are a condition of
      employment and must be noted in the remarks section of the appointment AF Form 2545.
      The CDC, School Age or Youth Director approves provisional appointments in writing.
      19.21.2. Requesting Background Checks. The OPM under a MOU with the AF completes
      background checks on both APF and NAF child care, school age program, and youth
      program employees. The NAF-HR is responsible for ensuring background checks are
      requested and completed for NAF personnel. Guidance and procedures for completing
      required forms and submitting requests for NACIs and SCHRCs are outlined in HQ
      AFSVA/SVX, Instructions for Completing Background Checks on NAF Employees Through
      the OPM, dated 11 Sep 2000. Security checks for child care, school age and youth positions
      are centrally funded with designated APF funds.
      19.21.3. Installation Records Check (IRC). NAF-HRs complete an IRC on individuals
      selected for CY positions involving regular contact with children under 18, when the selectee
      has a DoD affiliation such as living or working on an installation or is an active duty member
      or civilian family member. When employee has no DoD affiliation, this will be documented
      by the NAF-HR on Managerial Checklist for CY Positions (Attachment 28) which is
      forwarded to Child or Youth Program activity manager. If the individual was a previous
      employee, had a break in service of less than 2 years, and the IRC was conducted within the
      past 5 years a new IRC is not required. Supervisors/NAF-HRs will not appoint an applicant
      to a CY position before completion of a favorable IRC at the current AF installation.
         19.21.3.1. The IRC consists of a records check of all installations of an individual’s
         identified residencies for a minimum of 2 years before the date of the application. This
         records check will include, at a minimum, a file check of Security Forces Management
         Information System (SFMIS) which affords global background investigative data for all
         AF installations; Family Advocacy’s Air Force Central Registry which includes all drug
         and alcohol program files, medical treatment facility files, mental health, and life skills
         files using the form provided at Attachment 29; Family Housing files; and any other
         record checks as appropriate to the extent permitted by law. In most cases, a check of the
         SFMIS and Family Advocacy central registry will satisfy the requirement for IRCs from
         current and former installations with the exception of Family Housing records. NAF-
         HRs must request an IRC of Family Housing records from previous installations when
         records are maintained.
         19.21.3.2. Requesting IRCs from Former AF Installations. NAF-HRs work with each
         other in the exchange of information, and provide each other with the information in the
         format shown so as to not levy an undue burden on the NAF-HR at the former
         installation.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                301


          19.21.3.2.1. To request an IRC from an applicant’s former installation, the gaining
          NAF-HR should mail, FAX, or scan and email the following information (at a
          minimum) to the NAF-HR at the former installation and indicate which
          organization’s records as defined in para 19.21.3.1, should be checked:
          Applicant’s Name (including maiden and former name if known)

          Applicant’s SSAN

          Applicant’s current address (former address)

          Applicant’s date of birth

          Sponsor’s name

          Sponsor’s SSAN

          Copy of applicant’s ―Acknowledgment of Rights and Consent to Release Records‖
          statement.
          19.21.3.2.2. NAF-HRs tasked with checking former installation records initiate a
          record check of the organization indicated in the request. Since the installation where
          the individual currently resides contacts the Family Advocacy Air Force Central
          Registry and the SFMIS, the NAF-HR should not ask the former installation to
          conduct additional checks for those organizations. Additionally, when the family
          advocacy officer also serves as the installation mental health officer, NAF-HRs
          ensure requests for information ask for a review of the individual’s mental health
          records at any installation where he or she resided for the last 2 years. If the mental
          health officer at the installation where the individual now resides can access the
          individual’s medical records, there is no need to contact the mental health officer at
          previous installations.
          19.21.3.2.3. NAF-HRs tasked with providing information will respond to the
          requesting NAF-HR (by FAX or email) within 15 days of receipt of the request. If no
          information is available on an applicant at the previous installation, that NAF-HR will
          respond as such to the requesting NAF-HR. If the NAF-HR does not receive a
          response after 15 days, he or she follows-up on the initial request for information.
          19.21.3.2.4. Requesting IRCs from other DoD Components. To request an IRC from
          another DoD component installation (i.e., Army, Navy, etc), the NAF-HR mails,
          FAXes, or scans and emails a request with information identified in paragraph
          19.21.3.2.1. The IRC information provided by that component is comparable to the
          AF requirement. If the NAF-HR does not receive a response after 30 days, he or she
          follows-up on the initial request for information. If no response is received within 15
          days after the follow-up request, the supervisor and NAF-HR make a suitability
          determination based on the completed IRC(s) and other available information.
19.22. Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Registry Check. NAF-HRs complete the Dru
Sjodin National Sex Offender Registry Check prior to employment. The check requires visiting
302                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


http:/ /www.nsopr.gov and performing a name check of employee using the ―National Search
(all participating States and Territories)‖ option. Record results of the check on the Managerial
Checklist for CY Positions (Attachment 28).
19.23. State Criminal History Repository Check (SCHRC). NAF-HRs initiate SCHRCs
through the OPM who requests an SCHRC for each state listed on the form used to request a
NACI.
19.24. National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI). NAF-HRs initiate a NACI and
fingerprint check through OPM for employees selected for CY positions, unless the employee
had a NACI within the past 5 years, and there has not been a break in service greater than 24
months.
19.25. Reference Checks. CDC, School Age and Youth Managers documents the results of
two reference calls (personal, professional, or educational). Supervisors document results of
reference checks on Managerial Checklist for CY Positions (Attachment 28) and file
documentation of reference checks in the Supervisor’s Employee Work Folder.
19.26. Derogatory Information. Upon receipt of a derogatory background check, the NAF-HR
will notify the individual and his/her supervisor. NAF-HRs and supervisors take action to
adjudicate suitability according to guidelines contained in DoDI 1402.5 and other established
procedures. If currently assigned to a CY position, the supervisor must relieve the employee
from child care services duties and detail him/her to non-child care/youth service duties until a
final decision is made.
   19.26.1. The individual has the right to a copy of the information and the right to challenge
   the accuracy and completeness of the information according to AFI 33-332, Air Force
   Privacy Program. When directed by the investigative agency, the NAF-HR is not authorized
   to provide the employee a copy of the investigation. Requests for copies of derogatory
   information must be submitted according to the investigative agency’s requirements.
   19.26.2. If a current employee is determined to be unsuitable to provide child care/youth
   services, the supervisor initiates appropriate administrative action, which may include
   separation from NAF employment. The supervisor must take such action according to
   procedures in Chapter 8.
   19.26.3. Derogatory information is maintained according to procedures outlined below in
   paragraph 19.28 of this guidance.
19.27. Record Reverification. A Periodic Child Care Reinvestigation (PR) will be conducted
by the NAF-HR on all CY employees (and other child care workers identified in DoDI 1402.5)
at a minimum of every 5 years covering the time period since the completion of the last
background check. The scope will consist of an IRC and DCII/JPAS name search, and any other
checks that are appropriate. Results of the records reverification will be documented on the
Managerial Checklist for CY Positions (Attachment 28).
   19.27.1. When an employee has more than a 2-year break in service, a new background
   investigation (IRC, SCHRC, and NACI) is required.
   19.27.2. Military Members. When military members are employed in NAFIs, they must
   abide by background check requirements. Active duty military members (other than
   healthcare personnel) who have regular contact with children and youth on a recurring basis
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 303


   as part of a normal duty assignment or during their off-duty hours must have an IRC and a
   current military security clearance. In the absence of a current military security clearance, a
   name check of the DCII/JPAS must be conducted in addition to the IRC.
19.28. Maintaining      Investigation     Documentation. NAF-HRs    maintain   sufficient
documentation to show compliance with investigative requirements. Documentation must be
available for each employee, and show at a minimum:
      Dates each IRC was initiated, completed and what organizations or locations were
      checked.

      Date the NACI was initiated and completed. If tracers were initiated, document dates the
      tracers were initiated.

      Date each SCHRC was initiated through OPM, completed and which states were
      checked.

      Date the suitability determination was made and whether the determination was favorable
      or unfavorable.
   19.28.1. If it becomes necessary to make a suitability determination without all completed
   investigative requirements, documentation must indicate all security checks were initiated,
   the specific security check that was not completed, and the reason it was not completed.
   19.28.2. NAF-HRs document compliance with investigative requirements using the checklist
   at Attachment 28 of this guidance, or an equivalent locally developed form. NAF-HRs
   maintain this documentation in an envelope filed on the right side of the OPF. They also
   forward a copy of the Managerial Checklist for CY Positions (Attachment 28) to the
   supervisor for inclusion in the Supervisor’s Employee Work Folder. Updated checklists
   should be sent to the manager after changes are recorded.
   19.28.3. The NAF-HR maintains and disposes of the investigation information according to
   DoD 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program
   Management, DoDI 1402.5, Criminal History Background Checks on Individuals in Child
   Care Services, and this guidance. NAF-HRs destroy copies of security investigations
   containing no derogatory information after the suitability determination is made. The NAF-
   HR retains copies of security investigations containing derogatory information and which
   serve as a basis for an adverse administrative action or unfavorable suitability determination
   in the case file. Security investigations may not be filed in the employee’s OPF or
   Supervisor’s Employee Work Folder. The Managerial Checklist for CY Positions
   (Attachment 28) includes the suitability determination documenting the completion dates of
   all security investigations such as the NACI, IRC’s, etc., and is filed in the envelope on the
   right side of the OPF. Reference checks/pre-employment inquiries that show results from
   checks made of employment, personal reference or pre-employment vouchers and inquiries
   are not filed in the OPF and are recorded by supervisor on the Managerial Checklist for CY
   Positions (Attachment 28) and filed in the Supervisor’s work folder. Security Investigation
   Reports are documents and forms generated during investigations such as the AF Form 2583,
   Request for Personnel Security Action, DD Form 398-2, Department of Defense National
304                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      Agency Questionnaire, and the DJFD Form 258, FBI Applicant Fingerprint Card, and other
      background forms, investigative reports, and memos are not filed in the OPF.
19.29. Internal Personnel Actions and Separations
   19.29.1. Employee Advancement. Supervisors reassign employees from CY-01 to CY02
   within two pay periods after they gain necessary qualifications for advancement. Similarly,
   supervisors non-competitively promote employees from CY-02 to CY-03 within two pay
   periods after gaining necessary qualifications for advancement. Employees not promoted
   within two pay periods of gaining eligibility are entitled to retroactive
   reassignment/promotion and pay.
         19.29.1.1. CY employees will not remain at the entry and intermediate levels of (Pay
         band I) longer than necessary for appropriate training. Installations ensure training
         (including instruction, materials, and paid duty time) is available to assist employees in
         receiving and completing the required training for advancement to the target level.
   19.29.2. Submitting Personnel Actions. Supervisors/managers request personnel actions,
   e.g., reassignment, promotion, transfer-out, and any action separating an employee from
   employment by completing and submitting an AF Form 2548 to the NAF-HR. Managers
   attach a copy of the most current AF Form 1098 when submitting any of these personnel
   actions to the NAF-HR. The NAF-HR files the AF Form 1098 on the right side of the OPF
   to serve as a record of completed training.
   19.29.3. Employee Separation. Upon separation, supervisors provide employees with the
   following documentation:
              AF Form 1098 documenting all completed training.

              Investigative Checklist for Child Care/Youth Services (Attachment 28), or similar
              locally developed checklist.
         19.29.3.1. Supervisors inform employees to provide this documentation to NAF-HRs or
         civilian personnel offices when applying for child development or youth program
         positions in the future.
19.30. Pay Administration. Pay for CY positions and employees are administered according to
Chapter 18 and this document.
   19.30.1. There are two pay bands within the CY pay system. Pay band I covers CY-01 and
   CY-02 positions. Pay band II covers CY-03 through CY-05 positions. Each of the two CY
   pay bands has a minimum and maximum wage rate. Pay ranges are determined using the GS
   locality pay schedule. The pay range for Pay band I is equal to the hourly rate of pay for
   General Schedule 2, step 1 (minimum), and the hourly rate of pay equal to General Schedule
   3, step 10 (maximum). The pay range for Pay band II is equal to the hourly rate of pay for
   General Schedule 4, step 1 (minimum), and General Schedule 5, step 10 (maximum).
19.31. Pay Setting Upon Appointment.
   19.31.1. New Appointments. Supervisors set pay for newly appointed CY employees at any
   rate within the assigned pay band. Supervisors determine the hourly rate based on such
   factors as competition with the local labor market, difficulty in filling positions, applicant
   qualifications, and previous rate of pay.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  305


   19.31.2. Pay Setting for Previous and Current CY Employees. Set pay for employees who
   previously worked as a CY employee in any DoD component, or who are on leave without
   pay from another installation, according to the following table.

If the employee is appointed to a CY            then the employee must receive
position

at the same or lower level,                     an amount equal to or greater than his/her
                                                most recent CY rate.

at a higher level within the pay band or at a   a minimum 6 percent increase over his/her
higher pay band,                                most recent CY rate.



19.32. Movement To Positions Within The Same Pay Band. NAF-HRs process the
movement of an employee to the same or different CY grade level within the same pay band as a
reassignment action. Employees moving to a higher CY grade level within the same pay band
(i.e., CY-01 (PBI) to CY-02 (PBI), or CY-03 (PBII) to CY-04 (PBII)) must receive a minimum
6% increase. Management may decide to provide any amount above this level as long as it does
not exceed the prescribed ceiling for the applicable pay band.
19.33. Movement To Positions In A Higher Pay Band. NAF-HRs process the movement of
an employee to a higher CY pay band (i.e., CY-02 (PBI) to CY-03 (PBII)) as a promotion action.
Employees moving from CY PBI to PBII must receive a minimum 6% increase. Management
may decide to provide any amount above this level as long as it does not exceed the prescribed
ceiling for the applicable pay band.
19.34. Other Pay Increases:
   19.34.1. Management may increase an employee’s hourly rate at any time deemed
   appropriate, and for any amount within the pay band. Such increases recognize at or above
   satisfactory performance, are a mechanism for retaining valued employees, and may be made
   as frequently as management desires.
   19.34.2. Management must address the issue of pay adjustments for each employee at least
   annually, i.e., at least during the annual performance rating cycle. The decision to not grant a
   pay adjustment is not grievable.
19.35. Movement to Other Pay Systems. NAF-HRs set pay for CY employees moving to a
position in another pay system according to Chapter 18.
19.36. Special and Premium Pay Entitlements:
   19.36.1. Overtime Pay. CY employees are entitled to compensation for overtime work
   performed as prescribed in Chapter 18.
   19.36.2. Compensatory Time. Compensatory time for CY employees is administered
   according to guidance outlined in Chapter 18.
306                                                   AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


   19.36.3. Night Pay Differential. Night pay differentials are paid according to guidance
   outlined in Chapter 18. CY employees receive their scheduled rate of basic pay plus an
   additional differential of 10 percent of the scheduled rate for work which falls between 6:00
   PM and 6:00 AM.
   19.36.4. Sunday Premium Pay. CY employees are entitled to Sunday premium pay as
   prescribed in Chapter 18.
19.36.5. Holiday Pay and Holiday Premium Pay.. Holiday pay or holiday premium pay for CY
employees is administered according to guidance in Chapter 18.
   19.36.6. Application of New or Revised NAF Pay band Schedules. NAF-HRs apply
   legislative changes to the GS locality schedule to the minimum and maximum rates of pay
   for both pay bands on the CY schedule. In foreign areas, the NAF-HR adjusts the minimum
   and maximum rates for each of the two pay bands for CY employees according to the
   nationwide GS schedule that does not include locality pay. The NAF-HR only processes pay
   adjustments for the CY employees whose pay falls below the minimum of the adjusted pay
   band for their position to bring them within the band. The NAF-HR documents the executive
   order number and date in the remarks sections of the personnel action. No other pay
   adjustments are required.
       19.36.6.1. Any additional pay adjustments must be requested by management submitting
       a completed AF Form 2548 to the NAF-HR for each employee receiving an increase in
       pay. The NAF-HR processes the pay adjustments and documents in the remarks section
       of the personnel action that it is a management initiated pay adjustment. NAF-HRs do
       not document the executive order number on management initiated pay adjustments.
   19.36.7. Interim Geographic Adjustments (IGA). In accordance with Section 302 of the
   Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA), Public Law 101-509, the
   President in Executive Order 12786, 26 Dec 91, authorized the payment of an IGA to
   employees assigned to a duty station in the following geographical areas known as
   Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical areas (CMSAs): (1) New York - Northern New Jersey
   - Long Island, NY-NJ-CT; (2) San Francisco - Oakland - San Jose, CA; and (3) Los
   Angeles - Anaheim-Riverside, CA.
       19.36.7.1. The IGA is added to both the minimum and maximum rate of each of the CY
       pay bands for CY employees whose official duty stations are in one of the three CMSAs.
       CY employees whose pay is then below the minimum of the adjusted pay band for their
       position, have their pay adjusted to bring them within the band. No other adjustment of
       entitlement to the IGA is authorized.
19.37. Supervisor’s Employee Work Folder. Supervisors maintain the Supervisor’s Employee
Work Folder according to Chapter 2 and this guidance. The NAF-HR provides copies of the
following documents to the supervisor for inclusion in the Supervisor’s Employee Work Folder:
   19.37.1. Resume or equivalent application for NAF employment
   19.37.2. NAF Application Continuation Form (Attachment 24 of this guidance)
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                    307



  19.37.3. H.S Diploma and/or College transcripts
  19.37.4. Performance evaluation(s)
  19.37.5. Immunizations
  19.37.6. Each update of Attachment 28 of this guidance.

              GUIDE FOR DEVELOPING QUALIFICATION STANDARDS

A6.1. Use of Guide. This guide has been prepared to describe the procedures for developing
and validating qualification standards for AF NAF positions. Qualification standards describe the
knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAO) needed to perform AF NAF jobs
and the experience, education, or other evidence which indicates that a person possesses those
KSAOs. Qualification standards are intended to ensure the recruitment of a competent, stable
work force with EEO for all candidates on the basis of merit and fitness for the work to be done.
A6.2. Major Job Requirements (MJR) and (KSAO) Characteristics Identification. The
occupational analysis procedures selected for this guide focus on identifying MJRs and KSAOs.
   A6.2.1. Identify MJRs. The supervisor identifies typically around five MJRs that represent
   a summary of the major duties, responsibilities, and work behaviors for the position. After
   the MJRs have been identified, the next step is to rank order MJRs that are the "most
   important for success in the position" to the "least important for success in the position." The
   rank order process based upon work group consensus can simply be accomplished by
   assigning numbers to the MJRs (that is, one to the most important; two to the second most
   important, etc.). This rank ordering process is necessary in order to demonstrate the overall
   relative importance of the MJRs to success in the occupation. The final list of MJRs in rank
   order of importance is transcribed onto a worksheet.
   A6.2.2. Identify KSAOs. In qualification standards development, it is important to
   determine what KSAOs are required to become a successful performer in the occupation.
       A6.2.2.1. Knowledge Statements. Knowledge statements refer to a body of information
       applied directly to the performance of a function, which, if applied makes adequate
       performance in the occupation possible. Examples of knowledge statements are:
       knowledge of bookkeeping procedures and techniques, knowledge of motor vehicle
       safety standards, knowledge of file maintenance procedures, etc.
       A6.2.2.2. Skill Statements. Skill statements imply a present, observable competence to
       perform a learned mental or physical process. Skill statements refer to the proficient
       manner of performing work. Examples of skill statements are: skill in typing, skill in
       operating a tractor, skill in distinguishing sizes of parts, and skill in auditing records.
       Skill statements are useful in identifying worker characteristics that may require certain
       physical and mental requirements or evidence for certification requirements such as
       license requirements, etc.
       A6.2.2.3. Ability Statements. Ability statements refer to the capability to perform an
       observable activity at the present time. Examples of ability statements are: ability to
       interpret and apply regulations, ability to work with power tools, ability to write reports.
       A6.2.2.4. Other. Characteristics Statements. These statements refer to physical or
       mental characteristics which do not fall under any of the other definitions. Examples are
       personal traits such as stress tolerance or dependability which may be applicable in work
       situations which exceed normal requirements, such as the job of air traffic controller.
336                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


       A6.2.2.5. In general, KSAO statements normally begin with "knowledge of," skill in (or
       at)," or "ability to."
       A6.2.2.6. KSAOs are defined in terms of those things employees are expected to do
       without training or experience on the job. KSAOs, therefore, which employees will be
       expected to learn on the job are not included in the qualification standard.
   A6.2.3. Writing KSAOs. Following MJRs identification, a list of the KSAOs essential to
   the performance of the MJRs are completed. The phrasing of KSAOs is a matter of
   judgment. Subject-matter experts "brainstorm" KSAOs without excessive guidance.
       A6.2.3.1. At first it is not necessary that all of the KSAOs remain at the end of the
       occupational analysis process, but including them at the beginning demonstrates that all
       of the possible important KSAOs were considered. During the development and
       refinement of MJRs and KSAOs, all notes, rough drafts, and documents are retained as
       evidence for later justification and defense of the qualification standard.
       A6.2.3.2. Initially, fewer than 20 KSAOs normally adequately describe the most
       important worker characteristics in the occupational series. Keep in mind that KSAOs in
       qualification standards represent the minimum requirements for entry into the
       occupational series. KSAOs are further refined based upon a more specific job analysis
       when they are to be used for rating guides or interview guides.
       A6.2.3.3. After initial KSAOs have been identified, the next step is to rank order KSAOs
       that are the "most important to bring to the occupation in order to perform in a reasonable
       period of time" to the "least important to bring to the occupation in order to perform in a
       reasonable period of time." The rank order process is simply accomplished by assigning
       numbers to the KSAOs (that is, one to the most important; two to the second most
       important, etc.).
       A6.2.3.4. The KSAOs are reviewed as to whether they are essential to performance in
       the position. Those KSAOs that are determined to be less important or that could be
       acquired or learned in a reasonable period of time are not included in the qualification
       standard.
       A6.2.3.5. The KSAOs are also reviewed in terms of their value in distinguishing among
       candidates. If KSAOs do not make distinctions among candidates, they serve little
       purpose in identifying potentially successful candidates.
A6.3. Qualification Requirements Documentation. The purpose of the qualification standard
is to provide those minimum requirements for entry into the position. Any requirements used in
basic eligibility are clearly tied to the content of the job. After analysis of the occupation is
accomplished, the basic criteria for qualifications can be established.
   A6.3.1. Usually, more than one type of activity demonstrates a candidate’s possession of the
   KSAOs required for basic eligibility.
       A6.3.1.1. Experience:
           A6.3.1.1.1. Experience in jobs that are similar to or related to the KSAOs is
           frequently the most common measure of a candidate’s basic eligibility. Since
           qualification standards set the minimum requirements for basic eligibility into an
           occupational series, the experience requirements should be broad in scope. It is in the
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                337


        ranking process for specific jobs in the occupational series that experience more
        similar to the jobs to be performed is examined.
        A6.3.1.1.2. As much as possible, the experience required for basic eligibility is
        specifically tied to the KSAO and is not generally indicative of specific job types,
        titles, or organizational levels. For example, for the KSAO of "ability to type
        correspondence in final form," the experience sought should be reflective of that
        KSAO.       The experience requirement should read, "Increasingly responsible
        experience in typing correspondence in final form, with responsibility for grammar,
        spelling, and punctuation accuracy." This experience may have been gained in many
        types of positions not only those that are titled "secretary" or "office automation
        assistant."
        A6.3.1.1.3. In examining the KSAOs for some occupational series, there are certain
        basic functions found at every grade level of the occupation. Usually, these are
        KSAOs that are common to many related occupational series. This type of
        experience is called "general experience." That experience which is more specific
        and more specially related to the job is "specialized" experience. For example, in the
        Accounting Technician, 525 occupational series, every grade level requires certain
        general clerical skills, such as processing paperwork, filing, etc. This is "generalized"
        experience. The experience which is more specifically related to the accomplishment
        of accounting technician duties such as bookkeeping, voucher examining, etc., is
        "specialized" experience.
        A6.3.1.1.4. The type and quality of experience are the most important things to
        describe in qualification standards. Experience is not described in terms of time
        periods; instead, it is the level and breadth of experience that is described.
     A6.3.1.2. Education and Training:
        A6.3.1.2.1. It is recognized that there are instances of a candidate’s history, other
        than experience, which indicate the capability to fulfill KSAOs. Education and
        training are frequently the most common of these activities. Since qualification
        standards are built on specific KSAOs, care is exercised to ensure that the education
        and training entries correspond to the KSAO itself, and are not generalized. For
        example, a KSAO for the secretary occupation may be "ability to type documents in
        final form, assuring grammatical and other accuracy." The education and training
        that fulfills this KSAO is "education and training in which candidate gained skill in
        typing, as well as ability to determine grammar, spelling, and syntax correctness."
        This education and training is specifically related to the KSAO being measured.
        A6.3.1.2.2. "Education" usually refers to formal academic instruction in an
        educational institution. "Training" usually refers to other instruction, usually of a
        briefer, less formal nature. Except in the case of professional or highly technical
        positions, "education" and "training" are used almost interchangeably.
     A6.3.1.3. Other. There may be other indicators of a candidate’s possession of the
     required KSAO. These requirements must meet the same test of specific relationship to

                  EVALUATING QUALIFICATIONS OF CANDIDATES

A7.1. Crediting Experience and Education:
   A7.1.1. All experience and training of the quality and type specified in the standard,
   including experience and training gained in religious, civic, welfare, service, and
   organizational activities, are considered in determining qualifications regardless of whether
   or not any compensation was received.
   A7.1.2. Experience gained while on detail is credited the same as if it were a permanent
   assignment. Part-time experience is credited the same as full-time experience.
   A7.1.3. Experience in the armed forces is evaluated solely on its own merits with respect to
   the actual duties performed.
   A7.1.4. Reference to "school above the high school level" means an educational institution
   (for example, a business school or college, a junior college, or college or university) for
   which high school graduation or the equivalent is a prerequisite. Some qualification
   standards require education completed in an accredited college or university. Accreditation
   of a college is granted by a regional accrediting association, a State Department of Education,
   State Accrediting Commission, or State University.
   A7.1.5. Education which directly relates to the kind of experience required for a position
   may be substituted for the experience requirement. The length of the education and whether
   the course must be successfully completed is agreed upon by the NAF-HR and the selecting
   official.
A7.2. Personal Traits and Characteristics. Some qualification standards include a description
of certain work behaviors which are desirable. In filling such positions, selecting officials ensure
themselves, by reference checks, personal interviews, or other appropriate means, that applicants
possess these work behaviors to the degree necessary for satisfactory performance of work.
A7.3. Physical Requirements. Positions which have an obvious need for physical
requirements; that is, lifting, carrying, standing for long periods of time, etc. have these specific
requirements included in the standard itself. For all other positions, applicants must be
physically able to perform efficiently the duties of the position. Any physical condition which
causes the applicant to be a hazard to himself or others is disqualifying.
   A7.3.1. Applicants and employees cannot be disqualified arbitrarily on the basis of medical
   standards, physical requirements, fitness tests, or other criteria that do not relate specifically
   to job performance. In addition, reasonable accommodation will be provided to persons with
   disabilities who demonstrate that they can perform the work of the position to be filled.

                       GUIDANCE ON INTERVIEW TECHNIQUES

A8.1. Purpose and Use: This guide explains how to plan and conduct NAF employment
interviews. The suggested methods are useful when candidates are interviewed to obtain
information about their relative qualifications for the job, and a formal rating system is used.
Local management decides whether to use a rating interview. Factors in the decision are the
grade level of the position; the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) needed to successfully
accomplish the work of the position; personnel turnover in the occupation, etc. These techniques
do not apply in those instances where the selecting official confines the interview to an informal
exchange of information about the job and the candidate.
A8.2. Rating Interviews:
   A8.2.1. All selection procedures are job related. A job analysis process is used to develop
   job related interview questions. Job analysis is a method for identifying job content by (1)
   describing the major job requirements MJRs in terms of important duties, tasks, work
   behaviors, etc., and (2) listing the related KSAs needed for successful performance of each
   MJR. KSAs are used to develop a set of standard questions which are used to interview all
   candidates. This is the same basic process as that used to develop and validate qualification
   standards for NAF positions. Step by step procedures are found in Attachment 4.
A8.3. Results of the interview are documented by rating the employee’s responses to the
questions asked about each KSA. The following example rating scale is used for this purpose:
   A8.3.1. Five-Applicant’s answer indicates a superior understanding of this factor. Answer is
   judged superior; equal to the hypothetical ideal employee for this job.
   A8.3.2. Three-Applicant’s answer indicates an adequate understanding of this factor.
   Answer is judged average. The answer does not indicate superiority; but the applicant
   possesses the characteristics to an adequate extent to meet job demands.
   A8.3.3. One-Applicant’s answer indicates evidence of factors which may limit the applicant.
   Answer is judged below average compared to the hypothetical ideal employee.
   A8.3.4. NOTE: When the applicant’s answer clearly falls between the above descriptions,
   the rating assigned is two or four.
   A8.3.5. Style and Format. Following are a few fundamental rules of interview questioning:
   Avoid questions requiring a yes or no answer.

   Avoid asking questions so that the answer you would like to receive is obvious to the
   participant.

   Make questions as straightforward as possible. Avoid complex constructions.

   Try to obtain as many examples of behavior as possible. Ask about things accomplished,
   actual experience.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 341



  Avoid questions that may be an invasion of privacy; common sense is the best guide.

  Avoid expressing value judgments in questions.

  Show interest by asking for clarification or elaboration.
  A8.3.6. Taking Notes:
     A8.3.6.1. It does no good for an interview to produce information if that information is
     not transmitted to the interview discussion. The link is the interviewer. To perform this
     function, the interviewer takes notes during and immediately after the interview. No one
     can remember all the information brought out in an interview without taking notes. Note-
     taking may have the effect of formalizing the interview, but if properly done, the
     potential negative impact can be minimized. Moreover, the possibility of forgetting
     outweighs any slight "chilling" of the interview due to note-taking.
     A8.3.6.2. Most participants in an interview expect the interviewer to take notes. Some
     interviewers find it suits their style to mention at the beginning of the interview that they
     are going to take notes; others never mention it. Note-taking should be done openly, but
     not in a way that the participant can see what is recorded.
  A8.3.7. Common Pitfalls in Interviewing:
     A8.3.7.1. Advice-giving. An interviewer should not turn the interview into a counseling
     session. He or she should not volunteer suggestions on job or personal decisions or
     problems. Counseling takes time away from the data-gathering function of the interview.
     A8.3.7.2. Arguing. An interviewer should not argue with a participant. Questioning is
     completely acceptable. Expressing a difference of opinion is acceptable if done to
     evaluate a participant’s depth. A "heated discussion" is not acceptable. It takes valuable
     time away from seeking information, potentially upsets the participant (thus increasing
     his or her nervousness, and making him or her more guarded), and markedly weakens the
     interviewer’s powers of concentration and detachment. While an interviewer may
     completely disagree with a philosophy, attitude, or behavior expressed, he or she should
     not show it. More importantly, he or she should not let it color the perceptions or
     recording of other information.
     A8.3.7.3. Halo Effect:
         A8.3.7.3.1. An interviewer avoids the tendency to generalize an overall impression
         of a candidate (job related or otherwise) based on an individual KSAO. This is
         referred to as the halo effect. There are many ways in which a participant acquires a
         halo. A positive halo comes from a significant accomplishment, like heading a task
         force that developed an important new product, having gone to the right college or
         simply because the participant reminds the interviewer of himself or herself a few
         years back. A negative halo comes from a spotty job record, association with a
         certain group, or because the participant reminds the interviewer of someone the
         interviewer does not like.
342                                                     AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


           A8.3.7.3.2. Positive and negative halos are guarded against as they detract from the
           collection of information in the interview. Once a halo (positive or negative) is put
           on the head of the participant, there is a tendency to seek only supporting information.
           Significant information tending to diminish the halo is ignored. The only remedy
           seems to be to keep the problem in mind and fight against it by constantly challenging
           oneself.
       A8.3.7.4. Interviewer Orientation. An interviewer puts himself or herself in the place
       of the participant and should not think what it would mean if a certain thing was said, but
       rather what the participant means in response. All human beings tend to interpret events
       relative to their own backgrounds and experience. An interview is no different. To the
       extent possible, an interview should be participant oriented--considered from the
       participant’s point of view.
       A8.3.7.5. The Nervous Participant:
           A8.3.7.5.1. Just because an interview is conducted in a friendly, nonthreatening
           manner, does not mean that the participant is not nervous or will not see it as
           threatening. The participant is in an unfamiliar setting, being interviewed by an
           individual or a panel the participant sees as highly prestigious and important; the
           participant feels it is necessary to sell himself or herself.
           A8.3.7.5.2. Nervousness causes participants to misinterpret questions and nonverbal
           clues. Equally as important, nervousness hides behavioral characteristics that are
           important to observe in the interview. An extremely nervous participant cannot be
           effective in presenting his or her positive features.
           A8.3.7.5.3. The only cure for a participant’s nervousness is a warm, friendly,
           supportive interview. Friendly conversation helps (for example, about the weather or
           an area in the participant’s background with which he or she feels particularly
           comfortable), but this is not used to the extent that valuable interview time is wasted.
           Generally, only time relieves nervousness. If the interview is properly toned, that
           time is used in collecting nonthreatening information.
           A8.3.7.5.4. One of the worst things that happens to an already nervous participant is
           to be interviewed by a nervous interviewer. Each one reinforces the other’s
           nervousness. They pick up and misinterpret clues from each other. Prevention of this
           situation is the responsibility of the interviewer. Only complete and thorough
           preparation prevents nervousness.
A8.4. EEO Laws and Regulations. It is very important that interviewers not violate EEO laws
and regulations. Since many discrimination charges frequently involve the interview process,
there is a need to increase the awareness of areas to be avoided. Interviewers must avoid
questions involving: Race, Marital status, Religion, Occupation of spouse, Color, Arrangements
for care of children, National origin, Views on birth control, Sex, Abortion, Sexual Orientation,
Women’s rights, Age, Handicaps, Politics, and Employee membership or non-membership in
organizations.

                           GUIDE TO DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS

Section A--Guide to Disciplinary Actions
A9.1. This attachment is provided to assist supervisors in selecting proper penalties. It neither
replaces nor dictates penalties. Rather, it gives a general framework to help supervisors exercise
mature judgment in dealing with particular circumstances. Mechanical use of the guide must be
avoided.
A9.2. The column "Cause of Action (Offense)" does not include every potential cause. There is
no "Violation of Other Rules" cause shown because this item provides no guidance. In using this
column, the supervisor compares the current cause of action to all of those described and then
uses those that relate to his or her situation to help apply the general policy. By relating the
nature and seriousness of the current offense to the fundamental character of those listed, the
supervisor fits the current offense into the general framework. (If there is a directly applicable
cause of action shown, it is the one used to guide further consideration.)
A9.3. The "Typical Penalty" columns establish the range of penalties within which the penalty
to be assessed usually falls, and the maximum penalty that may be assessed for a comparable
nature offense. Because these ranges impose no mandatory minimum penalties, except as
required by law, the supervisor has a choice of severity of action, ranging from no penalty at all
to the maximum stated in the range. Thus, if the guide shows reprimand as the maximum, the
supervisor may determine that no penalty is needed; or he or she may use either an oral
admonishment or a reprimand. If suspension is listed as the maximum, an admonishment, a
reprimand, or a suspension of any number of calendar days, up to and including that shown in
this guide, could be assessed. A maximum of removal permits a choice of an admonishment, a
reprimand, a suspension, demotion, or a removal. The severity of the penalty depends on the
relationship of the current offense to those factors involved, including the nature of the current
offense and the nature and recency of other offenses.
A9.4. Notices of proposed action and of final decision need not contain specific information on
how the penalty was selected, other than that related to causes of action. In the event of an
appeal or grievance, management must, however, establish that the penalty was proper under the
circumstances, and that consideration was given to all material factors.

Notes:
1. See first page of this attachment; see DoDD 5500.7, Joint Ethics Regulation, for violations of
conflict of interest regulations.

2. Except where a lesser maximum penalty is provided, the maximum penalty for third or
subsequence offenses is removal. All periods of suspensions are calendar days.

3. See first page of this attachment.

4. Maximum penalty for a third offense within 2-year period is 1-day suspension, and for a
fourth offense in that period is 5-day suspension.

5. Normally, an oral admonishment is used.

6. 31 USC 638a(c) in 5 CFR and 31 USC 638a(c)(2) provides that any officer or employee who
willfully uses or authorizes use of government passenger motor vehicles or aircraft for other than
official purposes is suspended for not less than 1 month and is suspended for a longer period or
removed if circumstances warrant.

7. Actions involving these offenses must be carefully evaluated to ensure that the requirements
of the federal substance abuse program are met. Close consultations with the NAF-HR and the
base medical officer is required.
354                                                     AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011



8. Removal is warranted when U.S. citizens employed overseas become culpably involved with
the law enforcement authorities of a host government in whose country the USAF facility is a
guest. Such involvement reflects upon the U.S. and affects the success of its mission overseas.
9. There is no offense unless: (a) the validity of the debt is established; (b) there has been a
failure to either arrange for or comply with a repayment schedule; and (c) there is a current
complaint from the creditor. Suspension is not an authorized penalty. Maximum penalty for third
and fourth offenses within two-year period is reprimand with the added warning that a
"continuation of offenses could result in removal."

10. If a supervisor or manager has engaged in an act of discrimination, or in an activity that
adversely reflects upon the integrity of the management process, an evaluation is made of the
manner in which he or she generally discharges his or her management responsibilities, to
determine whether he or she should be reassigned or changed to lower grade to a position of
different character. (Reduction in grade is authorized under such conditions but may not be
effected in addition to another penalty for the same offense.)

11. For purposes of this manual, a dangerous drug is one so defined by the Attorney General of
the U.S. When a narcotic or dangerous drug has been prescribed for medical purposes under an
appropriate authority, its use by the patient as prescribed, is not an offense in terms of this
manual. Close coordination with the base medical officer and the staff judge advocate is
required.

12. The penalty is selected with due regard to the employee’s status as a drug experimenter,
drug user, or drug addict and should, whenever possible, contribute to the employee’s
rehabilitation and restoration.

disciplinary system are shown, but neither establishes additional procedural requirements nor
automatically sets penalties.

Notes:
1. For RIF SCD, compute leave SCD and delete any credit that was given for military service.

2. Prior service includes time served under the provisions of USAF NAF employment contracts
which were documents used to hire USAF NAF employees before publication of AFM 176-5.
358                                                     AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


Contracts in effect when AFM 176-5 was published were permitted to remain valid until their
expiration date or no later than the beginning of the first pay period in Jul 71, whichever
occurred first. These contracts do not include Personal Service Contracts.

3. If an employee was on board 1 Jul 74 when the SCD rules changed, the SCD should have
been recomputed to provide the greater benefits.

4. DoD NAFI service includes service with the AAFES.

5. Employees rehired after a break in service of one or more workdays are entitled to an SCD,
computed on those creditable factors authorized at the time of reemployment. Employees rehired
by reinstatement are considered to have been continuously employed without a break in service.

6. An employee who was on board before 1 May 75, and who remained a NAF employee on and
after 1 May 75, would retain any credited military service computed previously into the existing
SCD unless the present method of crediting military service produces a greater benefit.

7. If recomputation under rules four or five impacts adversely on an employee, employee retains
the SCD which provides the greater benefit.

8. Dates of wars, campaigns, and expeditions are found in OPM’s Vet Guide.

9. Use DD Form 214 to verify military service; in addition, for military retirees, you will need to
complete SF 813 to verify participation in campaigns and expeditions.

10. The Guide to Processing Personnel Actions, Chapter 6, may be used as a guide in crediting
military service and in the methodology for computing SCD for leave purposes.

11. Any SCD and leave accrual rate changes resulting from crediting military service are
adjusted effective 16 Feb 83. Recomputation to allow retroactive accrual prior to that date is not
authorized.

12. Any SCD and leave accrual rate changes resulting from crediting temporary service leading
to regular service are adjusted effective 28 Jun 83. Recomputation to allow retroactive accrual
prior to that date is not authorized.

         CLASSIFICATION STANDARDS FOR NAF PAY BAND POSITIONS

Section A--General Information
A11.1. This attachment sets forth guidelines for classifying NAF pay band positions. Three
general sets of guidelines are used: Characteristics of Work Performed, Job Grading Methods
for Mixed Jobs, and Job Grading Methods for Leader and Supervisory Positions.
   A11.1.1. Characteristics of Work Performed. The characteristics of work performed for
   each pay band consists of a narrative listing of duties appropriate for the pay band, the
   supervision provided for these types of positions, and suggested qualification requirements
   for these positions. (Section B)
   A11.1.2. Job Grading Methods for Mixed Jobs. These methods are used when the duties
   and responsibilities of a position cannot clearly be defined in one occupational area. (Section
   C)
   A11.1.3. Job Grading Methods for Leader and Supervisory Positions. These methods
   are used to grade positions that on a regular and recurring basis involve leading or
   supervising the work of three or more (full-time equivalent) employees. (Section D)
   A11.1.4. Listing of Commonly Used and Authorized NAF Position Titles and
   Occupational Series. This is a listing of position titles and corresponding occupational
   series commonly found in each pay band. The listings are not intended to contain all
   combinations of possible titles and occupational series. They are used along with the
   guidance contained in DoDM 1401.1-M-1 in assigning official position titles and series to
   NAF pay band positions. (Section E)
A11.2. Classifying NF Pay band Positions:
   A11.2.1. Compare the duties and responsibilities to the characteristics of work to determine
   the appropriate pay band. Assign the appropriate official position title, occupational series
   and pay band.
   A11.2.2. If the duties of the position cannot be clearly defined as belonging to one particular
   occupational series, then the methods used to classify and grade mixed jobs should be used.
   A11.2.3. Should the position guide contain leader or supervisory duties, the methods used to
   apply supervisory standards is used to determine whether or not the position is classified as a
   leader or supervisor.

           facility layout and design.
A11.8. Pay band NF-VI. Positions in pay band NF-VI are executive positions, with extensive
mission accomplishment responsibilities in directing the entire NAF component, or a major
subdivision thereof.
Section C--Job Grading Methods For Mixed Jobs
A11.9. A mixed job involves performance of duties in two or more occupations at the same or
different grade levels on a regular and recurring basis. A mixed job is graded in keeping with the
duties that involve the highest skill and qualification requirements of the job.
A11.10. If a job involves regular and recurring duties in the same pay band in two or more
occupational areas, the job is classified in the series reflecting the paramount qualification
requirement.
A11.11. In considering the variety of work performed as a classification factor in the grading of
a mixed job, the principle consideration is the extent to which the additional kinds of work
performed increases the position’s overall level of complexity. In determining whether a job
involving two or more occupational areas of the same pay band warrants an extra pay band, the
following guidance is considered:
   A11.11.1. Many kinds of work, although in different series or even in different occupational
   groups, are based on similar bodies of knowledge, require similar academic backgrounds,
   and utilize skills that are readily transferable from one kind of work to another. When such
   similarities exist, variety would not have pay band level significance.
   A11.11.2. Conditions do exist, however, when the variety of work can affect the final pay
   band of a position. The decision to classify a mixed job to the next higher pay band level is
   based upon a sound classification decision that the variety of skills and knowledge required
   contribute to an overall level of complexity that is greater than the position’s job parts
   individually. The duties of such positions are more difficult to perform because of the wide
   range of significantly different duties to be performed. In evaluating variety as a
   classification factor, consideration is given to the extent that the additional kinds of work
   enhance the position by requiring extra qualifications. A second consideration is the relative
   pay band value of the types of work involved. The addition of an entirely different but much
   less difficult type of work does not enhance materially the pay band level of a position.
A11.12. Duties performed only in the absence of another employee due to annual or sick leave
to meet emergency workloads, or for training purposes are not considered as regular and
recurring duties when grading mixed jobs.
Section D--Job Grading Methods For Leader and Supervisory Positions
382                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


A11.13. Range of Responsibility for Leader Positions.

   work done and for ensuring efficient and economical work operations.
   A11.14.2. Assigns, directs, and reviews the work of subordinates and evaluates their work

  A11.15.1. Positions in pay band NF-I are normally neither leader nor supervisory in nature.
  Situations may exist whereby classifying an NF-I position as a leader is proper. A position
  should be classified based on normal routine duties of the position, after which the range of
  responsibilities of leader positions in paragraph A11.13 are applied to determine whether the
  regular and recurring duties of the position fall within the range of leader responsibility.
  Adding leader to the official position title may be required. See paragraph A11.15.4.
  A11.15.2. Positions in pay band NF-II may be either leader or supervisory in nature. If the
  responsibilities for leaders and supervisors in paragraphs A11.13 and A11.14 fall within the
  regular and recurring duties of the position, adding leader or supervisor to the official
  position title may be required. See paragraphs A11.15.4 and A11.15.5.
  A11.15.3. Positions in pay bands III-VI are often supervisory in nature. However, it is
  entirely possible to have a nonsupervisory and supervisory position in the same occupational
  series and pay band. See paragraphs A11.15.4-A11.15.6.
  A11.15.4. If the position has leader responsibilities over three or more (full-time equivalent)
  employees, the position is identified by adding either the prefix "Lead" or the suffix "Leader"
  to the position title.
  A11.15.5. Similarly, if the position has supervisory responsibilities over three or more (full-
  time equivalent) employees, the position is identified by adding either the prefix
  "Supervisory" or the suffix "Supervisor" to the position title.
  A11.15.6. The words "Manager" and "Officer", when officially assigned as part of a position
  title, also denote supervisory responsibilities; therefore, in those cases, no supervisory prefix
  or suffix is required.

Table A11.1. Comparison of Duties and Responsibilities for Nonsupervisory, Leader and
Supervisory Positions

The following table assists users in determining the differences between leader and supervisory positions.
Note that nonsupervisory employees periodically may perform leader or supervisory type duties and
responsibilities during emergencies or for other short term periods. However, the intent of this standard is
to allow allocation to the leader level for positions that contain leader duties and responsibilities as a
continuing requirement.

Section E. AF NAF CLASSIFICATION STANDARD GOLF COURSE MANAGER AND
ASSISTANT MANAGER POSITIONS
A11.16. This standard is used in the classification of AF NAF positions that involve work as a
business and operational manager of 9-hole or more golf courses. These positions must possess
a thorough knowledge of the business practices and methods of managing a golf course facility.
   A11.16.1. EXCLUSIONS
Note. This classification standard is not designed for the direct evaluation of AF NAF
Assistant Golf Course Manager positions. These positions are classified using the guidance
on page 2; paragraph “Classifying Assistant Golf Course Manager Positions”.
       A11.16.1.1. This classification standard is not used to classify APF Golf Course
       Manager positions.
       A11.16.1.2. This classification standard is not used to evaluate positions that manage
       less than a 9-hole golf course.
       A11.16.1.3. This classification standard is not used to evaluate positions that provide line
       or staff policy direction or program guidance and review over golf course facility
       programs above base-level.
       A11.16.1.4. Some golf courses close for the winter season. The Golf Course Manager is
       reassigned to other duties and responsibilities during this period, such as managing a
       winter sports program, assisting the Bowling Center Manager, or assisting with other
       ongoing recreation programs. These duties and responsibilities are evaluated by
       classification standards appropriate for the type of work being performed. The principles
       for classifying mixed-grade positions are applied in these work situations.
   A11.16.2. GENERAL INFORMATION
       A11.16.2.1. Golf course facilities are used by the AF as essential MWR facilities, and as
       such, are to be operated on a non-restricted basis as an integral part of the installation’s
       sports and recreation program. Golf course facilities are normally operated as activities
       of the MWR fund, funded with NAFs and categorized as Category C, Business Activities.
       Ancillary resale activities, such as the pro shop, snack bar, etc., are normally a part of the
       golf operation. Sufficient NAF income must be generated to ensure financial solvency on
       an annual basis. The primary objective of the Golf Course Manager is to operate the
       facility in an atmosphere that encourages participation, ensures maximum availability,
       and generates sufficient income to remain financially sound.
       A11.16.2.2. Assistant Golf Course Manager positions are evaluated in relation to Golf
       Course Manager positions. Assistants are considered second in command of the Golf
       Course with full authority to act on all matters for which the Golf Course Manager is
       responsible. An example of a situation that warrants classification at this level is when
       the amount of work is so voluminous as to require a second person to share the manager’s
       responsibility and relieve him or her of the day-to-day work operations. This permits the
       manager to handle priority projects and crises situations. Another example is when the
       manager is required to regularly be away from the course and the assistant must have full
       managerial authority for daily operations. In each case, in order to be classified as an
386                                                     AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


       assistant, the position must have direct day-to-day line authority over personnel and work
       operations. Positions that meet these criteria are classified as follows:
           A11.16.2.2.1. For courses with less than 18 holes and a Golf Course Manager
           position classified at NFIII or above, the Assistant Golf Course Manager is classified
           at NF-III.
           A11.16.2.2.2. For courses with 18 or more holes and a Golf Course Manager position
           classified at NFIV or above, the Assistant Golf Course Manager is classified at NF-
           IV.
Note: The authorized title for a full assistant to the Golf Course Manager is Assistant Golf
Course Manager.

Note: The classification criteria for Assistant Golf Course Managers is developed under the
assumption that all Assistant Golf Course Manager positions operate under the same basic type
of supervision and guidelines. In situations where the assistant’s authority is limited in scope,
and performs at a level less than that described above (i.e., when the assistant performs some of
the manager’s functions and only assumes full responsibility in the normal absences of the
manager), judgment shall be used in determining the pay band level. Under no circumstances
shall an automatic one-pay band differential be attached to positions titled ―Assistant‖ without
regard to the level of authority and responsibility inherent in the position. The Assistant Golf
Course Manager usually works under the general supervision of the Golf Course Manager who
reviews results for conformance with established policies. Assistant Golf Course Manager
positions that operate under significantly closer supervisory controls are closely reviewed to
determine if the pay band warrants a downward adjustment. Deviations from that prescribed
above must be thoroughly supported and documented in a position evaluation statement.

        Supervision of employees is inherent in Golf Course Manager positions and is directly
        associated with the scope of management responsibility. As a result of this, supervision
        has not been described as a separate factor.
        A11.16.7.2. To receive credit for responsibility of course maintenance, powered carts, or
        a driving range, pro shop, or food and beverage operation, the Golf Course Manager must
        have total responsibility for its operations. If any of these activities are managed by a
        contractor or by another installation facility, such as one of the Clubs or Civil
        Engineering, no credit is given.
        A11.16.7.3. If changes in the scope of operations affect factor points significantly
        enough to warrant an increase or decrease in the pay band of the position, no immediate
        classification action is taken until the point value is sustained for 12 consecutive months.
        This rule is inserted to prevent constant changes in the pay band due to unusually high or
        low sales or golf play.

Note: The job grading criteria in this standard is developed under the assumption that all
Golf Course Manager positions operate under essentially the same type of supervision and
guidelines. The Golf Course Manager usually works under the general administrative
supervision of the Community Services Flight Chief who reviews results for conformance with
established policy and evaluates proposals requiring approval before implementation. The
manager may receive advice from a golf advisory committee concerning rules of play,
handicaps and course maintenance projects. NAF councils may review fees and charges.
Positions that operate under significantly closer supervisory controls are closely reviewed to
determine if the pay band derived by the job grading criteria warrants downward adjustment.

A11.17. Section F--AF NAF CLASSIFICATION STANDARD CLUB MANAGER AND
ASSISTANT MANAGER POSITIONS
   A11.17.1. This standard is used in the classification of AF NAF positions, the duties of
   which are (1) to manage an individual club, or a complex of clubs, or a primary club with one
   or more annexes; and (2) to administer, supervise, or perform work involved in providing bar
   service, recreational programs and services, official functions, and food services to include
   parties and/or special functions, and related services to military members, authorized
   civilians, retired members, dependents and guests.
   A11.17.2. EXCLUSIONS
Note. This classification standard is not designed for the direct evaluation of AF NAF
Assistant Club Manager positions. These positions are classified using the guidance on page
three of this document; paragraph “Classifying Assistant Club Manager Positions.”
       A11.17.2.1. This classification standard is not used to classify APF Club Manager
       positions.
       A11.17.2.2. This classification standard is not used to evaluate positions that provide line
       or staff policy direction or program guidance and review over club programs above base
       level.
       A11.17.2.3. This classification standard is not used to evaluate positions the duties of
       which are limited to clerical functions as maintaining accounts and records, preparing
       financial statements and reports, processing requests for maintenance and repair, budget
       administration, related financial management, or other work of a general clerical and
       administrative nature. Positions of this kind do not require club management and
       administrative knowledge, skills, and abilities.
Note. This classification standard is not used to evaluate positions the duties of which involve
primarily work concerned with furnishing all types of supplies, equipment, material, property,
and certain services to clubs receiving supplies from vendors. These positions require
knowledge of one or more elements or parts of a supply system or supply methods, policies, or
procedures.
   A11.17.3. GENERAL OCCUPATIONAL INFORMATION
       A11.17.3.1. This standard covers the direct management of a club or complex of clubs
       with one or more annexes and the facilities housing club operations. All positions require
       similar or basic knowledge or skills and abilities such as knowledge of club management
       methods, practices, and operating techniques related to providing bar service, recreational
       programs and services, official functions, and food services to include parties and/or
       special functions. The standard includes knowledge of professional club management
       and staff training; hospitality field requirements sufficient to provide a basis for sound
       management practices; knowledge of agency-and installation-level club programs; cost
       management and financial planning requirements; knowledge of information systems;
       and the ability to meet with local command military personnel, patrons, civic
       organizations, public-and agency-level officials. The knowledge, skills, and abilities are
       related directly to the work processes that comprise club management operations and
       increase proportionately as the difficulty and responsibility of positions increase. The
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               393


     basic work processes involved in the management and administration of a club program
     include:
        A11.17.3.1.1. Direct onsite responsibility for the management and administration of
        a club, or a complex of clubs, with one or more annexes.
        A11.17.3.1.2. Preparation of operating budgets (income and expense, capital
        expenditures).
        A11.17.3.1.3. Custodian of all records and property in possession of a club.
        A11.17.3.1.4. Maintaining control over cash assets and controlled forms in
        possession of a club.
        A11.17.3.1.5. Determination of equipment and facility maintenance requirements
        and accomplishment of required maintenance, replacement, redecoration, expansion,
        and improvement.
        A11.17.3.1.6. Planning and scheduling daily service menus, entertainment (including
        bingo and slot machines), special activities, functions and events, and catering
        services.
        A11.17.3.1.7. Procurement of required merchandise, goods, and services including
        proper storage to prevent spoilage and pilferage.
        A11.17.3.1.8. Responsible for the receipt, safekeeping, deposit, disbursement, and
        accountability of all club funds, including daily and monthly financial recordkeeping
        requirements.
        A11.17.3.1.9. Maintaining good patron and employee relations and rendering
        courteous and efficient patron service.
        A11.17.3.1.10. Supervision of employee staffing. Establishing and monitoring
        employee work schedules, assigning and distributing work, counseling employees,
        and conducting staff training.
        A11.17.3.1.11. Ensuring compliance with fire, safety, sanitation, and security
        standards.
     A11.17.3.2. Responsibility for the above functions may or may not require direct
     supervision or actual performance by a club manager. For example, in larger clubs,
     managers normally will not directly supervise employees in food and beverage
     preparation and service but are responsible for determining the types, quality, and
     quantities of food and beverage to be used for a particular function or for related general
     operating practices. Similarly, club managers normally are not involved directly in the
     accounting operations or directly approve contracting of goods and services. Contracting
     exceptions are approved by the local commander. However, they usually are responsible
     for reviewing all pertinent cost and financial reports and coordinating and monitoring the
     purchase of goods and services to ensure timely receipt, security, and storage.
     A11.17.3.3. The features outlined above reflect the nature and scope of the managerial
     and administrative responsibilities. At the lower levels, the positions are involved
     primarily in performing a variety of related administrative tasks in support of specific
     technical requirements involved in operating and maintaining the assigned club
394                                                       AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


        programs. At the higher levels, primary attention is given to policy development, broad
        management planning, and effective-cost management as a means of coordinating work
        forces and resources for the efficient, economical use of club facilities and equipment.
      A11.17.4. CLASSIFYING ASSISTANT CLUB MANAGER POSITIONS
        A11.17.4.1. Assistant Club Manager positions are evaluated in relation to Club Manager
        positions. Assistants are considered second in command of the club with full authority to
        act on all matters for which the Club Manager is responsible. An example of a situation
        that warrants classification at this level is when the amount of work is so voluminous as
        to require a second person to share the manager’s responsibility and relieve him or her of
        the day-to-day work operations. This permits the manager to handle priority projects and
        crises situations. Another example is when the manager is required to regularly be away
        from the club and the assistant must have full managerial authority for daily operations.
        In each case, in order to be classified as an assistant, the position must have direct day-to-
        day line authority over personnel and work operations. Positions that meet these criteria
        are classified as follows:
           A11.17.4.1.1. For clubs with a Club Manager position classified at NFIII, the
           Assistant Club Manager is classified at NF-III. Note: The authorized title for a full
           assistant to the Club Manager is Assistant Club Manager.
           A11.17.4.1.2. For clubs with a Club Manager position classified at NFIV or above,
           the Assistant Club Manager is classified at NF-IV.
Note: The classification criteria for Assistant Club Managers is developed under the assumption
that all Assistant Club Manager positions operate under the same basic type of supervision and
guidelines. In situations where the assistant’s authority is limited in scope, and performs at a
level less than that described above (i.e., when the assistant performs some of the manager’s
functions and only assumes full responsibility in the normal absences of the manager), judgment
shall be used in determining the pay band level. Under no circumstances shall an automatic one-
pay band differential be attached to positions titled ―Assistant‖ without regard to the level of
authority and responsibility inherent in the position. The Assistant Club Manager usually works
under the general supervision of the Club Manager who reviews results for conformance with
established policies. Assistant Club Manager positions that operate under significantly closer
supervisory controls are closely reviewed to determine if the pay band warrants a downward
adjustment. Deviations from that prescribed above must be thoroughly supported and
documented in a position evaluation statement.
      A11.17.5. PAY PLAN AND OCCUPATIONAL SERIES
        A11.17.5.1. The paramount requirement of Club Manager positions is a thorough
        knowledge of the business practices and methods of managing a club operation.
        Positions in this occupation require a variety of club management and administrative
        skills and abilities in such activities such as cost management and financial planning;
        procurement of resale merchandise, materials, supplies, equipment, and services;
        utilization and assignment of employees; planning, scheduling, and controlling club
        operations and activities; facility and equipment maintenance and control; cash controls
        and management; special requirement surveys to determine community needs and
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  395


     interests, determining facility and equipment improvements; master operational planning;
     and maintenance of good management, patron and command relations.
     A11.17.5.2. Club Manager positions are classified as pay band positions with the NF pay
     plan in the General Business and Industry Series 1101, since the 1100 occupational group
     does not contain a specific series for this kind of work.
  A11.17.6. TITLES. Positions classified using this standard are responsible for the overall
  direction and management of an AF NAF club operation. The authorized title for these
  positions is Club Manager.
  A11.17.7. JOB GRADING FACTOR CRITERIA
     A11.17.7.1. The following job grading criteria is predicated on Club Manager positions
     at all levels having certain common characteristics. Generally, the difficulty of
     assignments in direct club management can be affected by a number of factors related to
     fulfilling the basic mission of providing bar service, recreational programs and services,
     official functions, and food services to include parties and special functions to its patrons,
     as well as maintaining a self-sustaining club operation and exercising supervision over a
     number of pay band and crafts and trades employees. Supervision of employees is
     inherent in Club Manager positions and is directly associated with the scope of
     management responsibility. As a result of this, supervision has not been described as a
     separate factor.
         A11.17.7.1.1. The operational unit may consist of a club or a complex of clubs, or a
         club with one or more annexes. The club organizational structure consists of a
         system in which the individual club managers report to a Community Support or
         Business Flight Chief who provides required support to each of the club managers; or
         can consist of a system in which the individual club managers report directly to the
         FSS Commander or Director. As the result of the organizational variations in which
         these club managers must operate, they are exposed to different managerial,
         administrative, and cost-control responsibilities. Other difficulties can arise because
         of the need to coordinate actions with a variety of jurisdictions or management
         systems, policies, and methods that require the application of different operating
         procedures, controls, and practices.
         A11.17.7.1.2. The type of service a club offers has a large bearing on the complexity
         of the management aspects of the position. For example, within a given installation,
         protocol missions may have a priority over the social and recreational activities and
         require the services of a large number of employees; conversely, the requirement for
         predominantly lounge or casual food operations generate higher dollar volume with a
         relatively smaller number of employees and require a lesser degree of management
         planning. The continuing existence of high employee-turnover rates that exceed DoD
         component or local installation established parameters may be significant in that they
         create additional complexities in the work assignments.
         A11.17.7.1.3. The physical layout, structural design, condition, and age of the club
         facilities have an impact on management planning activities; create different
         administrative, maintenance, and cost-control problems; and affect the kind of
         services provided. The age, structural design, or actual layout of the club facilities
396                                                          AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


            increase the need for effective financial planning, add to the administrative task of
            resolving patron complaints, and require the ability to schedule major alterations and
            repairs with minimal impact on planned or scheduled services and recreational
            activities. The types and frequency of management decisions required that result
            from those conditions and the knowledge and skills required to accomplish them are
            significant considerations for evaluating positions covered by this standard.
            A11.17.7.1.4. To receive credit for responsibility of any factor, the Club Manager
            must have total responsibility for its operations. If any of these activities are
            managed by a contractor or by another installation facility, no credit is given.
            A11.17.7.1.5. If changes in the scope of operations affect factor points significantly
            enough to warrant an increase or decrease in the pay band of the position, no
            immediate classification action is taken until the point value is sustained for twelve
            consecutive months. This rule is inserted to prevent constant changes in the pay band
            due to unusually high or low revenue or membership.
        A11.17.7.2. FACTOR 1. REVENUE
This includes all sales and activity revenue, excluding slot machine income. Significance:
Except for slots, represents all sales and operating income centers, including reimbursed official
functions.

Represents the senior leadership person assigned to the base. The higher the rank results in
more protocol-directed functions. On bases that host both officer and enlisted clubs, full
credit is given to the club that normally handles these functions. The second club is
considered the alternate club for these functions.

Unique bases that host numerous high-ranked individuals (i.e., flag officers, congressmen,
senators, senior executive service personnel, presidential staff and dignitaries) on a frequent basis
that require constant management attention and have a unique mission for the U.S. AF. The
Bolling and Andrews AFB Officers’ Clubs are located in a high protocol environment in the
Washington DC area. The USAF Academy Officers’ Club is a high-level protocol area due to its
mission of training cadets. Due to these circumstances, these bases must plan, coordinate, and
execute a great number of protocol events, sometimes on a moment’s notice. The following
primary clubs receive additional points as indicated below.

Note: The job grading criteria in this standard is developed under the assumption that all
Club Manager positions operate under essentially the same type of supervision and guidelines.
The Club Manager usually works under the general administrative supervision of the
Sustainment Services Flight Chief who reviews results for conformance with established
policy and evaluates proposals requiring approval before implementation. The manager may
receive general advice from a club advisory committee. NAF councils may review fees and
charges. Positions that operate under significantly closer supervisory controls are closely
reviewed to determine if the pay band derived by the job grading criteria warrants downward
adjustment.
A11.18. –AF NAF CLASSIFICATION STANDARD FOR GOLF                                    COURSE
SUPERINTENDENT AND ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT POSITIONS
   A11.18.1. This standard is used in the classification of AF NAF positions that involve work
   as a golf course superintendent of 9-hole or more golf courses. These positions must possess
   a thorough knowledge of the management practices and methods of maintaining a golf
   course facility.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  399



   A11.18.2. EXCLUSIONS
Note. This classification standard is not designed for the direct evaluation of AF NAF
Assistant Golf Course Superintendent positions. These positions are classified using the
guidance on page 2; paragraph “Classifying Assistant Golf Course Superintendent Positions”.
       A11.18.2.1. This classification standard is not used to classify APF Golf Course
       Superintendent positions.
       A11.18.2.2. This classification standard is not used to evaluate positions that manage and
       maintain less than a 9-hole golf course.
       A11.18.2.3. This classification standard is not used to evaluate positions that provide line
       or staff policy direction or program guidance and review over golf course facility
       programs above base-level.
       A11.18.2.4. Some golf courses close for the winter season. The Golf Course
       Superintendent may be reassigned to other duties and responsibilities during this period,
       such as managing a winter sports program, assisting the Bowling Center Manager, or
       assisting with other ongoing recreation programs. These duties and responsibilities are
       evaluated by classification standards appropriate for the type of work being performed.
       The principles for classifying mixed-grade positions are applied in these work situations.
   A11.18.3. GENERAL INFORMATION
       A11.18.3.1. Golf course facilities are used by the AF as essential MWR facilities, and as
       such, are to be operated on a non-restricted basis as an integral part of the installation’s
       sports and recreation program. Golf course facilities are normally operated as activities
       of the MWR fund, funded with NAFs and categorized as Category C, Business Activities.
       There are no resale activities associated with the maintenance plan of the golf operation.
       Sufficient NAF income must be generated to ensure financial solvency on an annual basis
       to support the maintenance operations. The primary objective of the Golf Course
       Superintendent is to maintain the playability and aesthetics of the facility in an
       atmosphere that encourages participation, ensures maximum availability, and generates
       sufficient income to remain financially sound.
       A11.18.3.2. Assistant Golf Course Superintendent positions are evaluated in relation to
       Golf Course Superintendent positions. Assistants are considered second in command of
       the maintenance operations with full authority to act on all matters for which the Golf
       Course Superintendent is responsible. Golf Courses with 18 or more holes may require
       an assistant to support the day-to-day operations of these standards to large size courses.
       An example of a situation that warrants classification at this level is when the amount of
       work is so voluminous as to require a second person to share the superintendent’s
       responsibility and relieve him or her of the day-to-day work operations. This permits the
       superintendent to handle priority projects and crisis situations. Another example is when
       the superintendent is required to regularly be away from the course and the assistant must
       have full managerial authority for daily maintenance operations. In each case, in order to
       be classified as an assistant, the position must have direct day-to-day line authority over
       personnel and work operations.

       A11.18.3.3. Positions that meet these criteria at courses with 18 or more holes and a Golf
       Course Superintendent position classified at NF-IV or above, the Assistant Golf Course
       Superintendent is classified at NF-III.
       A11.18.3.4. The authorized title for a full assistant to the Golf Course Superintendent is
       Assistant Golf Course Superintendent.
Note: The classification criteria for Assistant Golf Course Superintendent is developed under
the assumption that all Assistant Golf Course Superintendent positions operate under the same
basic type of supervision and guidelines. In situations where the assistant’s authority is limited
in scope, and performs at a level less than that described above (i.e., when the assistant performs
some of the superintendent functions and only assumes full responsibility in the normal absences
of the superintendent), judgment shall be used in determining the pay band level. The Assistant
Golf Course Superintendent usually works under the general supervision of the Golf Course
Superintendent who reviews results for conformance with established policies. Assistant Golf
Course Superintendent positions that operate under significantly closer supervisory controls are
closely reviewed to determine if the pay band warrants a downward adjustment. Deviations
from that prescribed above must be thoroughly supported and documented in a position
evaluation statement. There are no provisions for Assistant Golf Course Superintendent to be
classified above the NF-III level.

  A11.18.8. JOB GRADING FACTOR CRITERIA
     A11.18.8.1. The following job grading criteria is predicated on Golf Course
     Superintendent positions at all levels having certain common characteristics. These
402                                                                AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


        common characteristics are maintenance program planning and execution, golf course
        project planning and execution, D5 budget planning, and exercising supervision over a
        number of pay band and crafts and trades employees. Supervision of employees is
        inherent in Golf Course Superintendent positions and is directly associated with the scope
        of management responsibility. As a result of this, supervision has not been described as a
        separate factor.
             A11.18.8.1.1. To receive credit for responsibility of golf course maintenance,
             powered cart maintenance, driving range maintenance, the Golf Course
             Superintendent must have total responsibility for its operations. If any of these
             activities are managed by a contractor or by another installation facility, such as one
             of the Clubs or CE, no credit is given.
             A11.18.8.1.2. If changes in the scope of operations affect factor points significantly
             enough to warrant an increase or decrease in the pay band of the position, no
             immediate classification action is taken until the point value is sustained for 12
             consecutive months. This rule is inserted to prevent constant changes in the pay band
             due to unusually high or low golf play.
        A11.18.8.2. FACTOR 1. NUMBER OF HOLES.
The number of holes is verified through the ORCA report.

                                        Attachment 12

      INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPLYING EXEMPTIONS FOR THE FAIR LABOR
                        STANDARDS ACT (FLSA)

Section A--Definitions of Executive, Administrative, and Professional Employees
A12.1. An employee is exempt from the overtime requirements of the FLSA if he or she is an
"executive", "administrative", or "professional" employee, as those terms are defined by 5 C.F.R.
Part 551. This attachment provides instructions for applying these exemptions.
A12.2. Guidelines are presented in three sections:
   A12.2.1. Executive, administrative, and professional employees definitions (Section A).
   A12.2.2. General guidance for applying executive, administrative, and professional
   exemption definitions (Section B).
   A12.2.3. Guidance that concerns applying specific categories (Section C).
A12.3. These guidelines represent permanent standards. They cover both general principles for
applying exemption standards and instructions for applying specific pay band and Federal Wage
System (FWS) occupations and standards terms. Specific classification and job grading
standards show the exempt or nonexempt position status that conforms to the work and level of
responsibility described in the standard. The exempt or nonexempt status of a position rests on
the actual duties of the position.
A12.4. Definitions. The principal exemption from the minimum wage and overtime provisions
of the FLSA are applicable to executive, administrative, and professional employees. For
purposes of applying the FLSA to the federal service, these categories of employees are defined
as follows:
   A12.4.1. Executive Employees. An executive employee is a supervisor, or manager who
   supervises at least three subordinate employees and who meets all of these criteria:
       A12.4.1.1. The employee’s primary duty consists of management or supervision.
       A12.4.1.2. The workers supervised constitute a recognized organizational unit.
       A12.4.1.3. The employee regularly exercises discretion and independent judgment,
       under only general supervision, in planning, directing, and controlling the work of the
       unit supervised.
       A12.4.1.4. The employee performs significant personnel management duties.
       A12.4.1.5. The employee’s position is classified no lower than NF-III. The employee
       fully meets or exceeds the "Supervisory range of responsibility" defined in the job
       grading standard for wage supervisors (if under the FWS) or equivalent prevailing rate
       systems.
       A12.4.1.6. Besides the primary duty criterion that applies to all employees, supervisors
       in the FWS, or the equivalent in other wage systems, and employees classified below NF-
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               409


     IV, must spend 75 percent or more of the work time, in a scheduled workweek, on
     supervisory and closely related work.
  A12.4.2. Administrative Employees. An administrative employee is an advisor, assistant, or
  representative of management, or a specialist in a management or general business function
  or supporting service whose position is according to standards in paragraphs A12.4.2.1
  through A12.4.2.5.
     A12.4.2.1. The employee’s primary duty:
         A12.4.2.1.1. Significantly affects formulating or executing management policies or
         programs;
         A12.4.2.1.2. Involves general management, business functions, or supporting
         services of substantial importance to the organization serviced; or
         A12.4.2.1.3. Involves taking substantial part in the executive or administrative
         functions of a management official.
     A12.4.2.2. The employee performs office or other predominantly non-manual work that
     is:
         A12.4.2.2.1. Intellectual and varied in nature; or
         A12.4.2.2.2. Of a specialized or technical nature that requires considerable special
         training, experience, and knowledge.
     A12.4.2.3. The employee must frequently exercise discretion and independent judgment,
     under only general supervision, in performing the normal day-to-day work.
     A12.4.2.4. The employee’s position is classified no lower than NF-III.
     A12.4.2.5. Besides the primary duty criterion that applies to all employees, NF
     employees below NF-IV must spend 75 percent or more of the work time, in a scheduled
     workweek, on administrative functions and work that is an essential part of those
     functions.
  A12.4.3. Professional Employees. The professional exemption duties include, but are
  broader than, those occupations identified as professional series under the GS. A
  professional employee’s primary duty standards require the employee performs work that:
     A12.4.3.1. Requires knowledge in a field of science or learning, customarily and
     characteristically acquired through education or training that meets the requirements for a
     bachelor or higher degree, with major study in or pertinent to the specialized field, as
     distinguished from general education; or performs work comparable to that performed by
     professional employees on the basis of specialized education or training and experience
     that has provided both theoretical and practical knowledge of the specialty, including
     knowledge or related disciplines and of new developments in the field; or
     A12.4.3.2. Is in a recognized field of artistic endeavor that is original or creative in
     nature (as distinguished from work that can be produced by a person endowed with
     general manual or intellectual ability and training) and the result of which depends on the
     invention, imagination, or talent of the employee.
410                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


       A12.4.3.3. The employee’s work is predominantly intellectual and varied in nature,
       requiring creative, analytical, evaluative, or interpretive thought processes for satisfactory
       performance.
       A12.4.3.4. The employee frequently exercises discretion and independent judgment,
       under only general supervision, in performing the normal day-to-day work.
       A12.4.3.5. The employee’s position is classified no lower than NF-III.
       A12.4.3.6. Besides the primary duty criterion that applies to all employees, NF
       employees below NF-IV must spend 75 percent or more of the work time, in a scheduled
       workweek, on professional functions and work that is an essential part of those functions.
Section B--General Guidance to Application of Executive, Administrative, and Professional
Exemption Definitions
A12.5. Terms Explained. Many of those terms used in FLSA exemption criteria have acquired
well-established interpretations that sometimes differ from the customary interpretation in the
federal service. In applying these definitions, the below terms have the meanings described in
this manual. These meanings do not carry over to other personnel management functions. FWS
employees whose positions fully meet or exceed the "Supervisory range of responsibility,"
defined in the Job Grading Standard for Supervisors, meet the definition of the terms "primary
duty," "recognized organizational unit," and "discretion and independent judgment."
Supervisory employees in other pay systems also are evaluated, for exemption determination
purposes, by using these supervisory classification standards.
   A12.5.1. Primary Duty. As a general rule, the primary duty is that which constitutes the
   major part (over 50 percent) of the employee’s work. However, a duty that constitutes less
   than 50 percent of the work is credited as the primary duty for exempt purposes, provided
   that duty:
       A12.5.1.1. Constitutes a substantial, regular part of a position.
       A12.5.1.2. Governs the classification and qualification requirements of the position.
       A12.5.1.3. Is clearly exempt work in terms of the basic nature of the work, the frequency
       with which the employee must exercise discretion and independent judgment, and the
       significance of the decisions made. For example, employees who occupy supervisory
       positions at NF-IV and above need not spend a majority of their time performing
       supervisory and closely related duties to be determined exempt. The employee is
       exempted by virtue of exempt supervisory duties that control the classification of the
       position as supervisory. This example does not apply to employees who occupy
       supervisory positions below NF-IV, because the additional percentage of the time
       criterion that must be applied to all employees below NF-IV, would not be met.
   A12.5.2. Recognized Organizational Unit. An established and defined organizational
   entity with regularly assigned employees. This requirement distinguishes supervisors who
   plan and complete a continuing workload from "leaders" who head temporary groups, formed
   to perform a special assignment of limited duration, or who direct the work of other
   employees assigned to a project, but do not exercise full supervision over such employees.
   Leaders of this nature do not qualify for exemption as executive employees.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                411


  A12.5.3. Significant Personnel Management Duties. This term is explained in supervisory
  classification standards for positions NF-IV and above.
  A12.5.4. Seventy percent of the Employee’s Work Time in a Representative
  Workweek:
     A12.5.4.1. This requirement is applied in terms of average percentages of time, over a
     period long enough to even out normal fluctuations in workloads, and be representative
     of the job as a whole. The length of time considered varies, depending on the nature of
     the work and the work situation, but should not exceed a year.
     A12.5.4.2. The 25 percent tolerance for nonexempt work covers irregular or incidental
     tasks of an employee who does not regularly perform any nonsupervisory duties.
     A12.5.4.3. If an employee spends more than 25 percent of the time on nonexempt work,
     the work must be evaluated according to paragraphs A12.5.5 or A12.5.6.
  A12.5.5. Supervisory and Closely Related Functions. In applying the 75 percent criterion,
  if the nonsupervisory work performed is closely related to supervisory functions, it is
  included in the exempt work. If it is not closely related, it is counted against the 25 percent
  tolerance from nonexempt work. The basic test for identifying closely related work is
  whether or not the work contributes to the effective supervision of subordinate workers, or
  the smooth functioning of the unit supervised, or both. Examples of closely related work
  include:
     A12.5.5.1. Maintaining various records that pertain to workload or employee
     performance.
     A12.5.5.2. Performing setup work that:
         A12.5.5.2.1. Requires special skills.
         A12.5.5.2.2. Typically is not performed by production employees in the occupation.
         A12.5.5.2.3. Does not approach the volume that would justify hiring a specially
         trained employee to perform.
     A12.5.5.3. Performing infrequently recurring or onetime tasks that are not practical to
     delegate because they would disrupt normal operations or take longer to explain than to
     perform.
  A12.5.6. Essential Part of Administrative or Professional Functions. In applying the 75
  percent criterion to administrative and professional employees, there is a more stringent
  requirement that related work be an essential part of those administrative or professional
  functions to be included in the exempt work. Such work is most easily identified by
  examining those processes involved in performing the exempt function. For example,
  processes involved in evaluating information include collecting and organizing the
  information; the analyzing, evaluating, and developing conclusions; and frequently,
  preparing a record of findings and conclusions. Often, collecting or compiling of
  information and preparing reports or other records, if divorced from the evaluative function,
  are nonexempt tasks. When the employee who performs the evaluative functions also
  performs some or all of these related steps, all such work is included in the employee’s
  exempt duties. However, if an employee performs routine work in collecting, compiling, or
412                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      presenting data on which some other employee performs the evaluative process, the time
      spent on such tasks is counted against the 25 percent tolerance.
      A12.5.7. Formulating or Executing Management Policies or Programs:
         A12.5.7.1. Management policies and programs range from broad national goals that are
         expressed in statutes or executive orders to specific objectives of a small field office.
         Employees may actually make policy decisions, or take part indirectly, through
         developing proposals that are acted on by others. Employees who significantly affect the
         execution of management policies or programs are typically those whose work involves
         obtaining compliance with such policies by other individuals or organizations, within or
         outside the federal government, or making significant determinations in the furtherance
         of program operations and the accomplishment of program objectives.
         A12.5.7.2. Administrative employees engaged in formulating or executing management
         policies or programs typically perform one or more phases of program management (for
         example, planning, developing, promoting, coordinating, controlling, or evaluating
         operating programs of the employing organization or of other organizations subject to
         regulation or other controls). Some of these employees are classified in occupations that
         reflect these functions (for example, program analyst), but many are classified in subject
         matter occupations.
   A12.5.8. General Management, Business, or Supporting Services. This element brings
   into the administrative category a wide variety of specialists who provide general
   management, business, or other supporting services, as distinguished from production
   functions. Administrative employees in this category provide support to line managers by:
         A12.5.8.1. Providing expert advice in specialized subject matter fields, such as
         management consultants or systems analysts;
         A12.5.8.2. Assuming facets of the overall management function, such as safety,
         personnel, or budgeting and financial management;
         A12.5.8.3. Representing management in such business functions as negotiating and
         administering contracts, determining acceptability of goods or services, or authorizing
         payments; or
         A12.5.8.4. Providing supporting services, such as automated data processing,
         communications, or procurement and distribution of supplies. Neither the organizational
         location nor the number of employees performing identical or similar work changes
         general management, business, or servicing functions into production functions.
         However, to warrant exemption, each employee’s work must involve substantial
         discretion on matters of enough importance that the employee’s actions and decisions
         have a noticeable impact on the effectiveness of the organization advised, represented, or
         serviced.
   A12.5.9. Taking Part in Management Official Functions:
         A12.5.9.1. This element includes those employees (variously identified as secretaries,
         administrative executive assistants, aids, etc.) who take part in portions of those
         managerial or administrative functions of a supervisor whose scope of responsibility
         precludes personally attending to all aspects of the work. To support exemption, such
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 413


     assistants are delegated and exercise substantial authority to act for the supervisor, in the
     absence of specific instructions or procedures.
     A12.5.9.2. Typically, these employees do not have technical knowledge of the
     substantive work under the supervisor’s jurisdiction. Their primary knowledge is of
     administrative procedures; organizational relationships; and, more important, those
     policies, plans, interests, and views of the supervisor. They apply such knowledge, with
     substantial discretion, in performing varied duties, such as:
         A12.5.9.2.1. Personally attending to or redirecting calls and visitors;
         A12.5.9.2.2. Scheduling or rejecting invitations and requests for appointments;
         A12.5.9.2.3. Representing or arranging for another staff member to represent the
         supervisor in meetings or conferences;
         A12.5.9.2.4. Locating and assembling information,            compiling reports,      and
         responding to nontechnical inquiries;
         A12.5.9.2.5. Composing varied correspondence, on own initiative and in response to
         incoming correspondence; or
         A12.5.9.2.6. Similar actions that significantly affect the supervisor’s effectiveness.
  A12.5.10. Work of An Intellectual Nature. Work that requires general intellectual abilities
  (such as perceptiveness, analytical reasoning, and perspective and judgment applied to a
  variety of subject matter fields) or work that involves mental processes that involve
  substantial judgment based on considering, selecting, adapting, and applying principles to
  numerous variables. The employee cannot rely on the standardized application of established
  procedures or precedents. The individual must recognize and evaluate the effect of a
  continual variety of conditions or requirements in selecting, adapting, or innovating
  techniques and procedures, interpreting findings, and selecting and recommending the "best"
  alternative from among a broad range of possible actions.
  A12.5.11. Work of a Specialized or Technical Nature. Work that requires substantial
  specialized knowledge of a complex subject matter and of those principles techniques,
  practices, and procedures associated with that subject matter field. This knowledge is
  characteristically acquired through considerable OJT and experience in the specialized
  subject matter field, as distinguished from professional knowledge characteristically acquired
  through specialized academic education.
  A12.5.12. Discretion and Independent Judgment:
     A12.5.12.1. The exercise of discretion and independent judgment involves:
         A12.5.12.1.1. Comparing and evaluating possible course of conduct.
         A12.5.12.1.2. Interpreting results or implications, and independently taking action or
         making a decision after considering various possibilities.            However, firm
         commitments or final decisions are not necessary to support exemption. "Decisions"
         made as a result of exercising independent judgment may be recommendations for
         action rather than the actual taking of action. The fact that an employee’s decisions
         are subject to review, and that on occasion these decisions are revised or reversed
414                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


             after review, does not mean that the employee is not exercising discretion and
             independent judgment of the level required for exemption.
         A12.5.12.2. There are three elements involved in evaluating this factor:
             A12.5.12.2.1. The work involves sufficient variables as to regularly require
             discretion and judgment in determining those approaches and techniques to be used,
             and in evaluating results. NOTE: This precludes exempting employees who perform
             work that primarily requires skill and precludes applying standardized techniques or
             knowledge of established procedures, precedents, or other guidelines that specifically
             govern the employee’s action.
             A12.5.12.2.2. The employee has authority to make such determinations during the
             course of assignments. NOTE: This precludes exempting trainees who are in a line
             of work that requires discretion, but who are not given authority to decide
             discretionary matters independently.
             A12.5.12.2.3. Decisions made independently must be significant. Although this term
             is not so restrictive that it includes only those kinds of decisions made by employees
             who formulate policies or exercise broad commitment authority, it does not extend to
             those kinds of decisions that affect only the procedural details of the employee’s own
             work, or to such matters as deciding whether a situation does or does not conform to
             clearly applicable criteria.
A12.6. General Considerations in Interpreting and Applying FLSA Exemption Criteria:
      A12.6.1. Numerous judicial precedents have firmly established principles that:
         A12.6.1.1. FLSA exemptions must be narrowly construed and applied only to employees
         who are clearly within the terms of spirit of those exemptions.
         A12.6.1.2. The burden of proof rests with the employer who asserts the exemption.
         Thus, if there is a reasonable doubt as to whether an employee meets criteria for
         exemption, the employee is ruled nonexempt.
A12.7. Combinations of Exemption Categories.
   A12.7.1. Although separate criteria are provided for exempting executive, administrative,
   and professional employees, those categories are not mutually exclusive. All exempt work,
   regardless of category, is considered. The only restriction is that (when requirements of one
   category are more stringent) the combination of exempt work must meet these higher
   requirements.
   A12.7.2. Failure to meet criteria for exemption under what might appear to be the most
   appropriate standard does not preclude exemption under another category. For example, an
   employee who fails to meet professional criteria may be performing exempt administrative
   work, or an employee who fails to meet administrative criteria may be performing exempt
   executive work.
   A12.7.3. Although it is usually feasible and more convenient to identify the exemption
   category, this is not essential. An exemption may be based on a combination of functions, no
   one of which constitutes the primary duty, or the employee’s primary duty may involve two
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               415


   categories that are intermingled and difficult to segregate. This does not preclude exempting
   the employee, provided the work, as a whole, clearly meets other exemption criteria.
Section C--Guidance Concerning Application To Specific Categories
A12.8. Applying Executive Criteria:
   A12.8.1. Quick Tests.
      A12.8.1.1. Nonsupervisory wage employees are nonexempt.
      A12.8.1.2. NF and FWS work leaders are nonexempt.
      A12.8.1.3. Wage supervisors whose positions do not fully meet or exceed the
      "Supervisory range of responsibility," as explained in factor I of the Job Grading
      Standard for Supervisors, are nonexempt.
      A12.8.1.4. Supervisory employees whose positions are classified in NF-III, or the
      equivalent, and who perform nonsupervisory work that is not closely related to their
      supervisory functions for more than 25 percent of the time are nonexempt.
      A12.8.1.5. Wage supervisors whose positions fully meet or exceed the "Supervisory
      range of responsibility," as explained in factor I of the Job Grading Standard for
      Supervisors, and who perform nonsupervisory work that is not closely related to their
      supervisory functions for more than 25 percent of the time are nonexempt.
      A12.8.1.6. General supervisors and higher level wage supervisors are exempt.
      A12.8.1.7. These NF-I and NF-II employees are nonexempt:
          A12.8.1.7.1. Nonsupervisory employees.
          A12.8.1.7.2. Leader employees.
          A12.8.1.7.3. Supervisory employees classified below the NF-III level.
          A12.8.1.7.4. Supervisory employees at the NF-III level who perform work not
          directly related to their supervisory functions more than 25 percent of their time.
      A12.8.1.8. Supervisory employees at the NF-III level who are exempt:
          A12.8.1.8.1. Perform supervisory and related duties 75 percent or more of their time.
          A12.8.1.8.2. Assume responsibility for planning and accomplishing a continuing
          workload that meets the intent of the recognized organizational unit requirements.
          A12.8.1.8.3. Regularly exercise discretion and independent judgment in planning,
          directing, and controlling the work.
          A12.8.1.8.4. Are responsible for significant personnel management duties.
   A12.8.2. Use of Job Grading Standard for Supervisors. With the exception of the time
   criterion percentage, where applicable, requirements for distinguishing true supervisors from
   work leaders, shown in those standards, parallel the executive exemption criteria. The
   supervisory duties are of the nature and level that fully meet or exceed the "Supervisory
   range of responsibility," as defined in the Job Grading Standard for Supervisors, if such
   duties:
416                                                   AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      A12.8.2.1. Constitute the primary duty for exemption purposes, even if they represent
      less than the majority of the work.
      A12.8.2.2. Involve responsibility for planning and completing a continuing workload
      that meets the intent of the recognized organizational unit requirement.
      A12.8.2.3. Demonstrate sufficient discretion and independent judgment in planning,
      directing, and controlling the work.
      A12.8.2.4. Include significant personnel management duties. These standards provide
      the most suitable guidelines for making an executive exemption determination for NF and
      FWS supervisors and are used in applying the executive exemption to employees in other
      pay systems.
   A12.8.3. Percentage of Time Criterion. The time criterion percentage is the essential test
   for determining the exemption status of NF supervisors who occupy positions classified
   below NFIV and FWS supervisors whose positions fully meet or exceed the "Supervisory
   range of responsibility" in the Job Grading Standard for Supervisors. These supervisors are
   exempt if they spend 75 percent or more of the work time, in a scheduled workweek, on
   work that is supervisory and closely related. Supervisors whose positions are classified at
   NF-IV and above and as general supervisor are exempt.
A12.9. Applying Administrative Criteria.
   A12.9.1. Quick Tests:
      A12.9.1.1. All employees whose positions are classified below NF-III or the equivalent,
      are nonexempt.
      A12.9.1.2. Nonsupervisory FWS employees and comparable employees in other wage
      systems are nonexempt.
   A12.9.2. Exemption Determinations for Other Administrative Employees:
      A12.9.2.1. Within the broad administrative category, but not necessarily exempt, are a
      large number of employees who apply specialized knowledge and skills in such functions
      as:
          A12.9.2.1.1. Determining the acceptability of goods or services;
          A12.9.2.1.2. Approving or rejecting applications for various benefits or claims
          against the government;
          A12.9.2.1.3. Examining persons, property, or records for compliance with laws or
          regulations or for assessment of taxes; or
          A12.9.2.1.4. Similar functions in which employees act as representative of
          management, often with substantial commitment authority.
      A12.9.2.2. Work is nonexempt if it is relatively standardized or can be structured so that
      most employees encounter recurrent kinds of situations that are covered by established
      guidelines. The work may require knowledge of a very extensive body of regulations,
      procedures, or precedent decisions that apply to a large number of different situations.
      However, the existence of established guidelines, if they specifically apply to the
      situation encountered (as distinguished from generalized guidelines that must be
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  417


      interpreted or extended), precludes the discretion and judgment characteristic of exempt
      work. Similarly, there is no true discretion, as that term is used in the exemption criteria,
      if the work primarily involves:
          A12.9.2.2.1. Skill in applying established techniques and specific standards (as in
          most inspection work);
          A12.9.2.2.2. Determining that factual evidence does or does not conform to specified
          conditions that govern actions taken (as in routine claims examining or processing
          applications); or
          A12.9.2.2.3. Decisions that are a necessary result of a prescribed or directed action
          (as in preparing computer program instructions when the exact information and the
          exact form in which it is to be presented are prescribed by others).
      A12.9.2.3. Within the NF job grading system, such work typically is classified in
      occupations that cover work that is inherently of a relatively standardized nature or that
      has been so structured, by isolating the more standardized work within an administrative
      or professional field into a technician occupation. The identification of such occupations,
      however, cannot be relied on as the sole determinate of exemption status. Although most
      employees are nonexempt, often employees at higher grade levels (for example, NF-IV
      through NF-VI) handle primarily cases for which guidelines are lacking or only generally
      apply, or for which factual information is not complete or contradictory. If the work
      requires substantial discretion and judgment, employees who perform such work are
      exempt, even though the occupation as a whole is considered nonexempt. For example,
      they are distinguished from skill in applying established techniques, standards, and
      knowledge on subject matters that significantly affect operations of the organization or
      the execution of management policy.
A12.10. Applying Professional Criteria.
   A12.10.1. Quick Tests:
      A12.10.1.1. Teachers who convey knowledge or serve as administrators of academic
      operations or functions in a school system or educational establishment are exempt,
      without regard to any other criteria.
      A12.10.1.2. All other nonsupervisory employees classified in professional occupations
      below grade NF-III (or the equivalent) are nonexempt.
   A12.10.2. Exempting Employees in Recognized Fields of Artistic Endeavor:
      A12.10.2.1. Creative artists are exempt under the professional category. Included in this
      category are:
          A12.10.2.1.1. Creators of original art, such as composers, painters, or writers who
          work from only a general subject matter or concept. Included are exhibit specialists,
          illustrators, photographers, and similar employees if the prime requirement is for
          creative work that portrays abstract concepts or evokes emotions, rather than for skill
          in accurately portraying objects or in conveying information visually.
          A12.10.2.1.2. Performing artists and directors, choreographers, or conductors who
          apply special talents and creativity in interpreting works created by others.
418                                                   AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


          A12.10.2.1.3. Critics or commentators who write or broadcast highly individualized
          analytical and interpretative views, as distinguished from reporting factual
          information only.
      A12.10.2.2. NF employees in the NF-1000 Information and Arts Group, and possibly a
      few other occupations who create original works of art or who apply interpretive
      creativity are evaluated against the professional exemption criteria in section A,
      paragraph A12.4.3. The most significant criterion is that the work be creative and
      individualized (that is, with results dependent on the invention, imagination, or talent of
      the employee, as distinguished from work that can be performed satisfactorily by any
      employee who has acquired those basic skills of the artistic field involved). The
      requirement for creativity is not necessarily related to the grade level of the work.
      Individual employees, at any given grade level, NF-III or above, may or may not qualify
      for exemption on this basis.
      A12.10.2.3. Much of the work in the Information and Arts Group, NF-1000, also
      involves significant administrative functions. When the emphasis is not so much on
      creativity as on the ability to produce, or to select from the work of others material that
      effectively achieves instructional or promotional program goals, the employee is
      evaluated against the criteria for the administrative exemption category in section A,
      paragraph A12.4.2.
   A12.10.3. Exemption of Employees in Occupations Identified in the Series Definition as
   Professional. All such occupations involve professional work that is inherently intellectual
   and varied in nature. The primary issue is the grade or pay band level at which employees in
   these occupations exercise sufficient independent discretion and judgment to warrant
   exemption.
      A12.10.3.1. The NF-III level frequently is a developmental level at which employees
      receive close supervision in process as well as on completion of the work, which
      precludes exemption. However, some professional disciplines include, as part of the
      academic training, substantial experience in the practical application of theory and
      techniques (for example, nursing or physical therapy) or laboratory courses that closely
      parallel work situations. Thus, in some professions, employees require relatively brief
      OJT and are able to apply professional knowledge and independent judgment that
      qualifies for exemption at the NF-III grade level.
      A12.10.3.2. The NF-IV level includes varying combinations of developmental
      assignments and independent work that, within the realm of professional work, is
      relatively routine, but which nevertheless requires professional judgment. Although most
      employees at this level qualify for exemption, it is often necessary to closely examine the
      frequency and degree of discretion and independent judgment exercised.
      A12.10.3.3. Employees properly classified in professional occupations at NF-IV and
      above are exempt.
   A12.10.4. Evaluation of Employees in Scientific and Engineering Technician
   Occupations. Employees in technician occupations who perform quasi-professional work,
   based on a limited knowledge of engineering or scientific theory and extensive technical
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                            419


  knowledge gained through practical experience (such as construction, operation or
  maintenance of equipment) are nonexempt, unless such employees either:
     A12.10.4.1. Exercise program responsibilities that qualify for exemption under
     administrative criteria (for example, develop preventive maintenance programs; analyze
     defect reports to identify one or more causes and determine a need for changing design,
     materials used, storage or maintenance practices, or similar functions that require
     decisions or recommendations reflecting evaluations of both administrative and technical
     considerations); or
     A12.10.4.2. Apply (within a narrow field of specialization) advance knowledge, both
     theoretical and practical, including knowledge of related disciplines and of new
     developments, in the independent performance of work that is very similar and
     comparable in level to that performed by professional employees in the field. The
     exemption of technician employees is based on the nature of the work performed, rather
     than the grade level per se. However, it would be unusual for employees classified below
     NF-IV to qualify for exemption and for employees at grades NFIV or above not to
     qualify for exemption.
420                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011



                                        Attachment 13

                REQUESTING INCREASED RATES AND SPECIAL RATES

A13.1. Additional guidance for requesting increased minimum hiring rates and processing pay
adjustments is found in DoDI 1400.25-V1405,and OPM, Operating Manual, Federal Wage
System NAF, subchapter S5-13. When conditions exist as described by table 18.13 due to NAF
regular wage schedules, the information shown below is developed.
A13.2. Responsibilities. When an increased minimum hiring rate is warranted, management
may request the NAF-HR submit a package requesting authority to use the second, third, fourth
or fifth step as the appointment rate of an occupation. The NAF-HR, with management’s
assistance, prepares the package and submits to the MAJCOM. The MAJCOM reviews for
accuracy and proper justification, endorses and forwards the package to HQ AFSVA/SVXH who
reviews and forwards a recommendation to HQ USAF/ILVR and DoD Civilian Personnel
Management Service, Wage Setting Division (CPMS/WSD) for approval/disapproval.
A13.3. Information in Support of Requests. When current market rates in the local wage area
are substantially above the minimum rate (step) of the local NAF wage schedule for a particular
occupation and grade, and local NAF activities in the area cannot recruit and maintain qualified
employees at that minimum rate, management may request authority to use the second, third,
fourth, or fifth step as the appointment rate to alleviate recruitment and retention problems.
Normally, a request for increased minimum hiring rates is submitted prior to requesting a special
rate schedule. As a minimum, information in answer to the following is included when
requesting increased minimum rates and special rates or rate ranges.
   A13.3.1. Recruitment Efforts:
   What are the occupations and grades in question?

   How many positions are vacant?

   How long have vacancies existed?

   Have internal promotion eligibles and plans been used without success?

   How many positions are currently filled?

   What methods have been used to publicize vacancies and for how long? (More than a token
   effort, such as a base daily bulletin, should have been attempted. Usually, an extensive effort
   to recruit from a variety of sources should be demonstrated.)

      How many applicants responded?

      How many applicants were qualified?
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              421


  How many applicants were offered jobs in those occupations for which difficulty is
  experienced in recruiting?

  What reasons were stated as to why offers were refused?

  purposes, by the supervisor and the NAF-HR?

  Were qualification standards reviewed for adequacy, in view of current position
  requirements?

  Are current position qualification requirements realistic?
  A13.3.2. Employee Retention:
  How many current employees are in like occupations and grades? Within the installation?

  Within the activity?

  What is the average length of time these positions have been filled?

  What is the employee turnover for the past 12 months?

  What reasons have employees given for leaving the position? If for higher pay elsewhere, it
  may help to report their new pay, if available.

  What are the current NAF regular schedule wage rates for the occupation and grades under
  consideration?

  Are any current employees in retained rates above the regular schedule? If so, how much per
  hour for each?

  Are there any known significant influences within the NAFI that affect turnover, other than
  pay rates?
  A13.3.3. Private Employer Prevailing Rates. From informal contacts with representative
  private employers:
  What are their rate ranges for similar occupations and grades? From and to what rates?

  What is their in-hire rate?

  Does their in-hire rate exceed the current DoD regular schedule minimum rate?

  Have local state employment services offices been requested to aid in recruitment?

  What hourly rate ranges do they report in use?
  A13.3.4. Local Federal Installations and Activities Within the Wage Area:

      Do other installations have similar NAF positions?

      How many such positions are filled and unfilled?

      If so, do they have the same problem of recruiting and retaining these occupations and
      grades?

      Has their participation and agreement been obtained concerning rates proposed?

    If not, what are their alternate actions and how do they differ from those proposed?

    Will increased rates affect any other closely-related positions? (For example, rate proposal is
    for mechanic and there are mechanic inspectors.)
A13.4. MAJCOM and HQ USAF/A1S Review. The NAF-HR is encouraged to obtain
informal help from the MAJCOM staff concerning the problem. Written proposals are sent,
through command channels, to HQ AFSVA/SVXH. Complete and valid proposals are reviewed,
and when substantiated, sent to HQ USAF/A1S, for action by the DoD Civilian Personnel
Management Service, Wage Setting Division.
A13.5. Procedures. The package will include:
A cover memo signed by the Force Support commander/director.

A brief narrative addressing:

specific title, series, and grades of positions in question;

leader and supervisory positions affected by the request;

minimum step sufficient to alleviate the recruitment problem;

locations for which rates are recommended;

estimated additional annual salary cost to the activity if proposed rates are approved;

answers to questions outlined in AFMAN 34-310, attachment 11 (see page 3); and

any additional information deemed pertinent to the request.

A copy of the local current wage pay schedule.

An endorsement memo signed by the MAJCOM Services commander/director.

A13.6. INITIAL AUTHORIZATION. The DoD CPMS/WSD will notify the base if the
increased minimum hiring rate is authorized. The notification will specify the authorized
minimum hiring step rate and the effective date of the rates. The NAF-HR processes a pay

adjustment for each covered employee whose pay is below the authorized rate, increasing the
employee’s pay to the minimum hiring rate.
A13.7. ANNUAL REVIEW. The NAF-HR annually examines and reevaluates the recruitment
and retention situation and level of competitive rates for each occupation covered by the
increased minimum hiring rate. The DoD CPMS/WSD will revise and reissue the authorization
annually unless circumstances warrant cancellation or they are notified that the increased
minimum hiring rate is no longer necessary. If the authorization is cancelled, current employees
remain at the same step as they were prior to the cancellation (i.e., employee’s pay is not
reduced). Employees hired after the date of cancellation are hired using normal pay setting rules
(usually at step one).

law, that grade must be used to establish your rights if there is a business based action following the
effective date of the personnel action shown on the AF Form 2545 (item 12). This does not, however,
affect your entitlement to grade retention in any way. You are entitled to retain the grade of (pay plan,
grade) for the period indicated in the remarks section (item 25) of the AF Form 2545, and to be paid the
rate for step (number) of that retained grade. You are also entitled to within-grade increases in your
retained grade during your retained grade period, assuming all requirements are met. Because you are not
being paid a step rate in the lower grade, a "00" is shown in item 20B. During the grade retention period,
your retained grade will also be used in determining any retirement and insurance benefits to which you
may be entitled, and in determining your eligibility for promotion and training.

           OVERTIME ENTITLEMENT FOR CT (NS, NL, NA) EMPLOYEES

A17.1. Coverage.
   A17.1.1. Nonexempt Employees in a Nonforeign Area. These employees are entitled to
   be paid for overtime for hours worked in excess of 8 hours in a day that does not exceed 40
   hours in the workweek, or in excess of 40 hours in a scheduled workweek when ordered,
   directed, required, approved, or "suffered or permitted" to work the overtime. Exceptions
   would be employees on an alternative/flexible work schedule. In that event, overtime would
   be paid for hours worked in excess of that normally and officially scheduled. Any work a
   nonexempt employee performs for the benefit of the NAFI (whether or not requested) is
   working time, if the employer knows of or has reason to believe it is being performed. Thus,
   a nonexempt employee who starts working before the scheduled shift, even though the work
   was not requested by the supervisor, is entitled to compensation for overtime work. If
   management does not authorize overtime work, it must make sure that nonexempt employees
   work only during their scheduled tour of duty. Supervisors must keep accurate records of
   hours that nonexempt employees work.
   A17.1.2. Employees in a Foreign Area. These employees are entitled to be paid overtime
   for hours worked in excess of 8 hours in a day that does not exceed 40 hours in the
   workweek, or in excess of 40 hours in a scheduled workweek only when ordered, directed,
   required, or approved to work the overtime. Exceptions would be employees on an
   alternative/flexible work schedule. In that event, overtime would be paid for hours worked in
   excess of that normally and officially scheduled.
   A17.1.3. Exempt Employees. These employees are entitled to be paid overtime for hours
   worked in excess of 8 hours in a day that does not exceed 40 hours in the workweek, or in
   excess of 40 hours in a scheduled workweek only when ordered, directed, required, or
   approved to work the overtime. Exceptions would be employees on an alternative/flexible
   work schedule. In that event, overtime would be paid for hours worked in excess of that
   normally and officially scheduled.
A17.2. Standby and On-Call Duty. An employee who is required to remain at or within the
confines of his or her post of duty in excess of 8 hours a day, in a standby or an on-call status, is
entitled to overtime pay only for hours of duty, exclusive of eating and sleeping time, in excess
of 40 hours a week.
A17.3. Work Exceeding 8 Hours in a Day. When an employee works more than 8 hours in 1
day, including a Sunday or a holiday, time in excess of the 8 hours is paid at the overtime rate,
even though it is a part of a scheduled 40-hour week, unless the employee is on an
alternative/flexible work schedule. For example:
   A17.3.1. Four 10-hour days.
   A17.3.2. Four 9-hour days and one 4-hour day.
A17.4. Overtime Rates. Except as otherwise specifically authorized, an employee is paid for
overtime work performed at the rate of one and one-half times the rate of basic pay.
434                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


A17.5. Overtime Rate for Sunday or Holiday Work. An employee is paid for overtime work
on a Sunday or a holiday at the same rate as for overtime work performed on another day.
A17.6. Computing Overtime Rate. The hourly overtime rate is computed by multiplying the
basic hourly rate of pay by one and one-half.
A17.7. Computing Overtime Pay for Night Work.
   A17.7.1. Overtime pay for an hourly paid employee regularly working a night shift for
   which a night shift differential is paid, is computed on that night rate, even though the hours
   of overtime worked extend into or fall entirely within another shift. For example, an
   employee whose basic pay is based on the second shift and the employee is requested to
   perform overtime work on either the first or third shift has the overtime computed on the rate
   of the second shift.
   A17.7.2. If the overtime work is performed on a day not regularly scheduled as a workday
   for the hourly paid employee or his or her organization, overtime pay is computed on the rate
   of the employee’s last previous regularly scheduled shift.
   A17.7.3. When the overtime work is performed on a day not regularly scheduled as a
   workday for the hourly paid employee, but is a regularly scheduled shift for the organization,
   overtime pay is computed on the rate of the shift actually worked by the employee on that
   day.
   A17.7.4. Overtime pay for an hourly paid employee having a regularly rotating tour of duty
   that includes two or more shifts is computed on the rate of the employee’s regularly
   scheduled shift in effect for the calendar day on which the overtime is performed. When
   such overtime work is performed on a day not regularly scheduled as the workday of an
   employee, overtime pay is computed on the average of basic pay for all regularly scheduled
   shifts worked by the employee during the workweek.
A17.8. Computation of Overtime Worked. The compensation of the amount of overtime
work of an employee is subject to these conditions:
   A17.8.1. Leave With Pay. An employee’s absence from duty on paid leave, during the time
   when he or she would otherwise have been required to be on duty during a daily or weekly
   tour of duty (including authorized absence on a legal holiday or a non-workday established
   by an Executive or administrative order), is considered employment. It does not reduce the
   amount of overtime pay to which the employee is entitled for work performed in excess of 8
   hours in a day, or work in excess of 40 hours in an administrative workweek. Payment of the
   overtime is authorized only if the employee performs work during the hours in excess of the
   8-hour day, or the 40-hour workweek.
   A17.8.2. LWOP. For a period of LWOP in an employee’s workweek, an equal period of
   service performed outside the workweek, but in the same administrative workweek, must be
   substituted and paid at the rate that applies to his or her workweek. Any remaining period of
   service is paid on the basis of the rate in excess of 40 hours in the workweek. For a period of
   LWOP in an employee’s daily tour of duty, an equal period of service performed outside the
   employee’s daily tour of duty, but in the same workday, is substituted and paid for at the rate
   that applies to the daily tour of duty, before any remaining period of service is paid at the
   overtime rate, on the basis of exceeding 8 hours in a workday.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                             435


  A17.8.3. Night, Holiday, or Sunday Work. Hours of night, holiday, or Sunday work are
  included in determining, for overtime pay purposes, the total number of hours in employment
  in the same administrative workweek.
  A17.8.4. Call-Back, Overtime Work. Irregular or occasional overtime work performed by
  an employee on a day when work was not scheduled for him or her, or for which the
  employee is required to return to his or her place of employment, is considered at least 2
  hours in duration for the purpose of overtime pay, whether or not the work is performed.
  Thus, callback time is viewed as an exception to the general rule that overtime compensation
  is only allowed for work actually performed. However, 2 hours is the maximum that is paid
  for work that is not actually performed.
436                                                    AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011

        OVERTIME ENTITLEMENT FOR PAY BAND (NF, CY) EMPLOYEES

A18.1. Coverage.
   A18.1.1. Nonexempt Employees. Overtime payment is required for hours worked that are
   officially ordered or approved, or suffered or permitted to be worked by the employee. Any
   work a nonexempt employee performs for the benefit of the NAFI (whether or not requested)
   is working time, if the employer knows of or has reason to believe it is being performed.
   Thus, a nonexempt employee who starts working before the scheduled shift, even though the
   work was not requested by the supervisor, is entitled to compensation for overtime work. If
   management does not authorize overtime work, it must make sure that nonexempt employees
   work only during their scheduled tour of duty. Supervisors must keep accurate records of
   hours that nonexempt employees work.
   A18.1.2. Exempt Employees. These employees are entitled to be paid for overtime hours
   worked in excess of 40 hours of work actually performed in the workweek only when the
   overtime is specifically ordered, directed, required or approved in advance. Refer to
   paragraph 18.15 for guidance on when compensatory time may be granted.
A18.2. Hours Worked.
   A18.2.1. Importance of "Hours Worked. " The amount of money an employee receives
   cannot be determined without knowing the number of hours he or she has "worked."
   A18.2.2. Basic Rule. "Hours worked" in general, includes the time an employee is required
   to be on duty (or on the NAFI’s premises or at a prescribed workplace), and for the
   nonexempt employee all time during which he or she is "suffered or permitted" to work for
   the NAFI.
   A18.2.3. Specific Examples in Determining "Hours Worked. " The following examples
   are (not all inclusive) furnished as a guide to supervisors for determining "hours worked" for
   their employees:
      A18.2.3.1. Time spent traveling (but not other time in travel status) away from his or her
      official duty station is "hours worked" when it cuts across the employee’s workday. The
      time is not only "hours worked" on regular workdays, during normal work hours but also
      during the corresponding hours on nonwork-days. Thus, if an employee regularly works
      from 0830 to 1700 from Monday through Friday, the time spent traveling during these
      hours is work time on Saturday and Sunday, as well as on the other days.
      A18.2.3.2. Actual meal periods are not considered "hours worked." The employee must
      be completely relieved from duty for eating regular meals. If an employee’s meal periods
      are uninterrupted, except for rare and infrequent emergency calls, meal periods can be
      excluded from work time. On the other hand, if meal periods are frequently interrupted
      by calls to duty, the employee is not considered relieved of all duties and all meal periods
      are considered as "hours worked." If an employee is completely free from duties during
      his or her meal periods, it is not necessary that he or she be permitted to leave the
      premises for the time to be excluded from work time.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 437


       A18.2.3.3. Excused absences with pay (holidays, sick, annual, or other paid leave) are
       not periods of work, even though the employee is compensated for these periods of non
       work. Therefore, for the purpose of determining whether more than 40 hours have been
       worked and whether overtime entitlement exists, such periods of non work are not
       included in the "hours worked" during the workweek. For example, an employee whose
       tour of duty is Monday through Friday, takes 8 hours (1 day) of annual leave on
       Wednesday, and then works 8 hours on Saturday, has 40 "hours worked", and is not
       entitled to overtime.
A18.3. Overtime Entitlement and Computation:
   A18.3.1. Overtime Entitlement. Overtime entitlement does not begin to accrue until the
   employee has first completed 40 hours of actual work in a week. For example, an employee
   who has any paid time off during the week (holiday, annual or sick leave, or any excused
   absence with pay) does not accrue any entitlement to overtime pay until additional actual
   work exceeds the paid hours of non work, and is in excess of 40 hours of actual work in the
   week.
   A18.3.2. Overtime Rate of Pay:
       A18.3.2.1. Nonexempt Employees. The overtime hourly rate of pay is one and one-half
       times the employee’s hourly rate of basic pay exclusive of any premiums or differentials.
       A18.3.2.2. Exempt Employees. For the exempt NF or CC employee whose rate of basic
       pay –
Does not exceed the minimum rate for GS-10, the overtime hourly rate of pay is one and one-
half times the employee’s hourly rate of basic pay.

Exceeds the minimum rate for GS-10, the overtime hourly rate of pay is one and one-half times
the hourly rate of basic pay at the minimum rate for GS-10.

                                        Attachment 19
  THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT (FLSA) COMPLIANCE AND COMPLAINT
                             SYSTEM

A19.1. General Information. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for
administering the FLSA for most federal employees. This responsibility encompasses
individuals paid with either appropriated or nonappropriated funds. Under the Act, the OPM
assumes the same protective relationship for federal employees covered by the FLSA as the
Department of Labor (DOL) has traditionally assumed for the nonfederal work force in matters
related to overtime pay, minimum wages, equal pay, and child labor. The law, its legislative
history, and the DoL precedent clearly call for the OPM to engage in vigorous enforcement of
the Act. Conducting compliance reviews of agency-FLSA-related actions and resolving
employee complaints alleging violations are two main aspects of the OPM’s role as administrator
of the Act.
A19.2. Scope of OPM FLSA Compliance and Complaint Activities.
   A19.2.1. The OPM operates a federal FLSA compliance and complaint system in a manner
   that parallels the basic outlines of DoL practice; that is, a statutory investigative and
   compliance procedure. Therefore, an employee alleging an FLSA violation has a right to file
   a complaint directly with the OPM. The law itself also establishes the right for an employee
   to bring action in a US District Court, either directly or after having received the OPM
   decision on his or her FLSA complaint.
   A19.2.2. The OPM requires that any FLSA violation brought to its attention and
   substantiated by the facts be corrected. Corrective action ordered includes paying retroactive
   wages, ensuring that the Act is complied with in the future, and other necessary or proper
   actions. Further, in keeping with the OPM’s intention to parallel DoL practices, the burden
   of proof in FLSA complaints is primarily on the employer. Unlike the DoL, however, the
   OPM continually must be aware of the legal requirements of 5 U.S.C. provisions.
   Consequently, the OPM treats its responsibilities under the FLSA in a most comprehensive
   way. This duality of legislative application requires that OPM personnel assigned to FLSA
   administration functions be knowledgeable of 5 U.S.C. pay matters and correct improper
   employer actions under 5 U.S.C.
   A19.2.3. The OPM’s Directorate for Agency Compliance and Evaluation (DACE) and its
   counterpart regional evaluation divisions operate the OPM’s FLSA compliance and
   complaint system. These organizations now conduct reviews of personnel management in
   federal agencies.
A19.3. Operation of the Compliance Component of the Federal FLSA Compliance and
Complaint System. Compliance reviews are integrated with the OPM’s personnel management
evaluation program. Adherence to the Act is probed during OPM personnel management
evaluations, as well as being the subject of special OPM compliance reviews. Within the AF, it
is a part of the AF’s human resources quality assessment evaluation system.
A19.4. Types of Complaints the AF Entertains.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                439


   A19.4.1. An employee or former employee (or his or her representative) may bring to the
   attention of the AF matters which include, but are not limited to, those where the complaint
   alleges:
       A19.4.1.1. Working regular, nonovertime hours without compensation.
       A19.4.1.2. Working overtime hours without proper compensation.
       A19.4.1.3. Being improperly scheduled to work less hours than guaranteed, or required
       for their employment category.
       A19.4.1.4. Being improperly scheduled to work more hours than in a regular work
       schedule, or employment category without the benefit of additional benefits.
       A19.4.1.5. Not being paid Sunday premium pay, holiday pay or shift differentials, etc.,
       when entitled to such pay.
A19.5. Operation of the AF Compliance and Complaint System.
   A19.5.1. Employees or former employees who believe they have been denied pay or benefits
   as outlined in paragraph A19.4 file a claim against the NAFI to secure proper payment if
   informal efforts to resolve the issue fail.
   A19.5.2. The claim must be fully documented at the time it is filed and, normally, is
   presented to the local NAF-HR within 15 days of the event resulting in improper payment, or
   of the date the employee first became aware of the fact that he or she was improperly paid, or
   the date of the informal decision.
   A19.5.3. Failure to meet this time constraint is a factor considered in honoring any later
   claim submitted for retroactive pay adjustments, when there is evidence that the delay was
   within the claimant’s control, and also serves to establish an earlier ending period than
   claimed.
NOTE: Management always has the prerogative, as well as the duty, to correct erroneous
personnel actions, regardless of how it becomes aware of them.
   A19.5.4. In no event, however, will a claim of this type be accepted more than 2 years after
   the alleged improper payment or the date the employee first became aware of it (3 years for
   claims of willful failure to pay proper compensation).
   A19.5.5. When the NAF-HR accepts a claim and determines it is valid, the NAF-HR is
   authorized to direct payment of retroactive wages and benefits, as appropriate, for no more
   than 2 years (3 years for willful violations) back from the date the claim is received by the
   NAF-HR.
A19.6. Types of FLSA Complaints the OPM Entertains.
   A19.6.1. An employee or third party may bring to the OPM’s attention any matter
   considered to be a violation of the FLSA. "Third party" generally means any person or
   organization representing the employee. Typically, these matters involve such things as
   failure to pay proper overtime wages, including:
Allegations that employees have been "suffered or permitted" to work outside regular hours
without proper compensation, in violation of the Act.
440                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


"Equal pay" issues that involve paying different wages to men and women for performing
substantially the same work in the same establishment (in effect, the violation of classification
principles).

Minimum wage violations.

Child labor violations.
   A19.6.2. Relative to employee complaints on exempt or nonexempt determinations, the
   OPM does not require a complainant to demonstrate injury, due to his or her categorization.
   However, the OPM does not entertain complaints on merely hypothetical issues.
A19.7. Operation of the Complaint Component of the Federal FLSA Compliance and
Complaint System. The OPM complaint procedure operates along these lines:
   A19.7.1. An employee who believes the FLSA has been violated files a complaint with the
   applicable OPM regional office. The regional Personnel Management Evaluation Division or
   DACE in the Washington area, investigates the complaint and requests a written
   presentation from the employer.
   A19.7.2. The employee has the opportunity to review and rebut the employer’s presentation
   in writing. The Evaluation Division or DACE determines if onsite investigation is necessary
   and conducts any such investigations. This includes reviewing time and attendance records,
   payroll records, and all other pertinent documents. Sworn statements, in affidavit form, are
   obtained, if necessary.
   A19.7.3. Compliance orders are issued by the OPM regional directors or DACE, if
   violations are found, and all affected employees are notified.
   A19.7.4. A request to reopen and reconsider an FLSA decision is directed to the Director,
   OPM. Such a request is made by either the employee, a representative of the employee, or
   the NAFI involved. Any such request explains in full, with supporting documentation, why
   the case should be reopened.
   A19.7.5. As indicated previously, an employee has the right to bring action in a US District
   Court if dissatisfied with an OPM determination. The employee could go directly to the
   court if he or she so desires.
A19.8. Confidentiality for Complaint System.
   A19.8.1. The OPM operates its FLSA complaint system in such a way as to maintain
   confidentiality for complainants, unless it is not possible to do so under the circumstances.
   Every reasonable effort is made to preserve confidentiality. Such efforts include expanding
   an investigation to cover an entire work unit from which the complaint originated. If the
   work unit is very small, the investigation is further expanded to make sure that the blanket
   approach preserves the confidential nature of the complaint.
   A19.8.2. It is hoped that employees (as well as their agencies) who have complaints make
   every effort to resolve complaints through the regular supervisory channels, before beginning
   formal investigation under AF or OPM compliance and complaint procedures. However,
   because of the OPM intention to protect employee confidentiality, there is no requirement
   that this be done. If employers discriminate against or take reprisal in any form against an
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 441


   employee who exercises his or her rights by filing an FLSA complaint, the FLSA makes it
   clear that they are engaging in illegal practices.
A19.9. Sources of Compliance and Complaint Program Information.
   A19.9.1. OPM personnel in 10 regional agency compliance and evaluation (ACE) divisions
   are trained to operate the compliance and complaint system.
   A19.9.2. NAFI managers and NAF-HRs share the primary responsibility for making
   exemption determinations on the basis of the individual duties performed. There may be
   situations when an OPM determination is needed on exemption questions that involve groups
   of positions or particularly complex exemption matters. The NAF-HR directs requests for
   such determinations, in writing, through the MAJCOM to HQ AFSVA/SVXH.
   A19.9.3. Requests include PDs and PGs, current classification evaluation statements, an
   NAF-HR statement giving reasons for using the proposed course of action, and any other
   pertinent internal documents. Although the OPM helps in making exemption determinations
   on groups of positions, such determinations are not necessarily binding on all positions in the
   group. It must be recognized that the greatest standards for making exemption determination
   are the individual duties performed. Such duties, on an individual position basis, change
   over a period of time, so that a single position, in a group of generally exempt positions, may
   properly be categorized as nonexempt.
A19.10. Time Limits on Filing Complaints. An FLSA complaint by an NAF employee must
be filed within 2 years of the alleged violation. Three years are allowed for claims involving
willful violations of the Act.
A19.11. Disputes on Pay Computation. If there is a question on whether or not monies due
the employee are correct, the employee has a right to present a claim directly to HQ
AFSVA/SVXH for final determination of monies due. For example, he or she presents the
statement: "The employer and I agree on the number of hours of overtime that I have worked
and that I am nonexempt. Nevertheless, the NAF-HR or NAF AO is not computing correctly the
amount of money owed to me."

                                         Attachment 20
       TRAVEL TIME AS HOURS OF WORK FOR THE EXEMPT EMPLOYEE

A20.1. Travel Time Considered Employment. Time in travel status away from the official
duty station of an employee is deemed employment only when:
It is within his or her regularly scheduled administrative workweek, including regular overtime
work; or

        The travel:

        Involves the performance of actual work while traveling.

        Is incident to travel that involves the performance of work while traveling.

        Is carried out under such arduous and unusual conditions that the travel is inseparable
        from work.

        Results from an event that could not be scheduled or controlled administratively.
A20.2. T ravel Time Not Considered Employment. It is recognized that there are times when
the employee is required to travel away from his or her official duty station outside regularly-
scheduled work hours. When this travel is performed under one of those four conditions shown
in paragraph A20.1, it is hours of employment for pay purposes. When the travel is not
performed under one of those four conditions, it is not hours of employment for pay purposes.
A20.3. Travel Time and Overtime Entitlements. Although time in a travel status away from
an employee’s official duty station meets conditions for being considered as hours of
employment, it is not payable as overtime unless travel outside regularly scheduled duty hours is
officially ordered and approved. Thus, to be payable as overtime, an official must require the
employee to travel outside his or her regularly scheduled work hours, under one of the qualifying
conditions, or after the travel is performed, he or she must approve the time of travel. To this
extent, time in a travel status is no different than other overtime hours.
A20.4. When Travel Time is Considered Hours of Work. Before considering those various
conditions under which travel is considered hours of work, it is well to consider when an
employee’s time in travel status begins, and the meaning of "official duty station" and "travel
status".
   A20.4.1. Official duty station means the employee’s designated post of duty, the limits of
   which are the corporate limits of the city or town in which the employee is stationed. If the
   employee is not stationed in an incorporated city or town, the official duty station is the AF
   installation on which stationed, or other established area having definite boundaries within
   which the designated post of duty is located. The meaning of this term is as used in the JTR.
   A20.4.2. In determining the amount of time in a travel status, which would be included as
   hours of employment, an employee is considered to be in a travel status only for those hours
   actually spent traveling between the official duty station and the point of destination, or
   between two TDY points, and for the usual waiting time that interrupts the travel.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                    443


   A20.4.3. Usually, when traveling by means of a common carrier, time in travel status begins
   with the scheduled time of departure from the common carrier terminal, and ends upon
   arrival at the common carrier terminal located at the point of destination. Thus, travel from a
   station, wharf, or other common carrier terminal to either a place of business or residence
   (including temporary place of business or residence), and from either a place of business or
   residence to a station, wharf, or other common carrier terminal, is not considered time in
   travel status. An exception to this rule is when the employee must spend 1 hour or more in
   travel between the common carrier and the place of business or residence; then the entire
   time spent traveling between the carrier terminal and the place of business or residence (that
   is, actual time spent traveling, exclusive of any waiting time at terminal before scheduled
   departure time) is considered hours of employment.
   A20.4.4. If an employee travels by automobile, time spent in transit between the residence
   and the place of business may not be regarded as time spent in travel status away from the
   official duty station. The time in travel status begins with the departure from the employee’s
   place of business or headquarters, and ends with the arrival at the point of destination. If the
   employee travels from his or her residence directly to the point of destination, the time used
   is considered time spent in travel status away from the official duty station. However, the
   estimated travel time from the employee’s place of business to the point of destination is
   regarded as the maximum limitation on travel time that is payable.
   A20.4.5. If an employee, for personal reasons, such as an aversion to flying, does not use the
   mode of transportation selected by the AF, or, for his or her own convenience, travels by an
   indirect route or interrupts travel, the employee is considered to be in a travel status only for
   the estimated time spent in traveling to the point of destination, by the mode of transportation
   selected by the AF.
A20.5. Travel Under Arduous and Hazardous Conditions. Travel that occurs within the
employee’s regularly scheduled hours of work, that is carried out under such arduous and
unusual conditions that it is inseparable from work, are not new conditions under which travel is
considered hours of employment. Usually, the travel or transportation conditions must be
viewed in the light of the particular circumstances under which the travel is required. Travel
under arduous conditions would include travel over unusually adverse terrain during severe
weather conditions, or travel to remote, barely accessible facilities by foot, horseback, or a truck.
Travel by automobile over a hard-surfaced road, when no unusual adverse weather conditions are
encountered, or travel by rail would not usually constitute travel under arduous conditions. Also,
the time of travel (whether to be performed during the day or night) or distance of travel is not
usually considered in determining whether the travel is performed under arduous conditions. A
distinction is also drawn between arduous conditions and hazardous conditions, keeping in mind
that the latter may contribute to the former.
A20.6. Travel That Involves the Performance of Work While Traveling. This means work
that can only be performed while traveling. But, if a NAFI requires an employee to work while
traveling, the time spent doing the job is considered work, even though it is the kind of work that
would ordinarily be done at the employee’s place of business. In this latter situation, criteria
used in determining whether or not the work is required to be done while traveling are those
same standards used in determining whether or not overtime work is officially ordered or
approved. Pay, if warranted, is limited to the time actually spent working.
444                                                     AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


A20.7. Travel Incident to Travel that Involves the Performance of Work While
Traveling. An employee is usually in this situation when on a "deadhead" trip, either traveling
to a destination to board a means of transportation on which he or she will be doing work while
traveling, or, having performed work while traveling, returning to the official duty station.
Entitlement under this condition is limited to the situation where the work done while traveling is
work that can only be done while traveling. But, the travel must meet the requirements of being
"away from the official duty station" to be considered hours of work.
A20.8. Travel Which Results From an Event That Cannot be Scheduled or Controlled
Administratively. The phrase "could not be scheduled or controlled administratively" refers to
the ability of the NAFI to control the event that necessitates an employee’s travel. The control is
assumed to be the NAFIs, whether the NAFI has sole control, or the control is achieved through
a group of NAFIs or other government organizations acting in concert. For example, training
courses throughout the country usually are scheduled to start at the beginning of the workweek,
and usually start at 0900 daily. Attendance at training centers located away from an employee’s
duty station, therefore, usually require the employee to travel outside normal work hours.
Because the government organization that is conducting the training course can schedule the
hours of training, the training course is an event that can be scheduled or controlled
administratively. The employee’s time in travel status outside of normal duty hours, regardless
of whether employed by the government organization conducting the training course or another
government organization, is not considered as hours of work for pay or compensation purposes.
Travel is considered hours of work if it results from unforeseen circumstances (for example, a
breakdown of equipment) or from an event that is scheduled or controlled by someone or some
organization outside of the government.
A20.9. Examples of Travel Not Administratively Scheduled or Controlled.
      A20.9.1. Case Number 1:
SITUATION: For reasons of economy, an employee is directed to travel by military aircraft,
boat, etc., although commercial transportation is available within the employee’s regularly
scheduled tour of duty.

DETERMINATION: Availability or limitation on travel funds does not constitute an
administratively uncontrollable event, and the hours of travel are not hours of work.
   A20.9.2. Case Number 2:
SITUATION: Training courses by private organizations usually are scheduled to start at the
beginning of the workweek. Attendance at a training course conducted in a location away from
the employee’s duty station may require the employee to travel outside normal work hours.

DETERMINATION: Unless the training course is conducted by a private institution (outside
the government) for the benefit of the government, it is an event that cannot be scheduled or
controlled administratively. Required travel outside the employee’s regular work hours to attend
the training course is considered hours of work. However, if a training course is conducted by an
institution for the benefit of the government, the event is considered under the administrative
control of the government.
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   445


       A20.9.2.1. Thus, if a training course is conducted by a private institution, but not solely
       for the benefit of the government, and if the course is completed on Thursday, and the
       employee returns that night, the hours spent traveling are hours of work. This applies
       only if the employee is ordered to return that night, and return is required by an event that
       could not be scheduled or controlled administratively.
       A20.9.2.2. If permitted the option of returning during regularly scheduled work hours on
       Friday, return on Thursday night is not payable because he or she is not officially ordered
       to return that night.
       A20.9.2.3. But, if the employee (whose regular hours of work are 0800 to 1700, Monday
       through Friday) completes the course at 1700 Friday, travel on either Friday night or
       Saturday (depending on available transportation) is payable, because he or she is not
       entitled to per diem if remaining until Monday. Thus, travel time cannot be controlled
       realistically.
A20.10. Condition Under Which Travel Is Work. The above conditions do not apply to work
situations involving travel time that is an inherent part of, and inseparable from, the work itself.
In such events, when the NAFI determines that the travel represents an additional incidental duty
directly connected with the performance of a given job, and is considered to be an assigned duty,
the time spent in travel is work time and is payable at regular or overtime rates.
A20.11. Responsibility for Scheduling Travel. NAFIs are required to record reasons for
requiring travel outside the workweek, if the travel is not payable according to this attachment.
The official who has the authority to order or approve overtime work has the authority to
determine when travel is required to be performed outside the workweek, subject to this
attachment.
A20.12. Conclusion. If possible, an employee’s travel should be scheduled within regular work
hours. However, situations may develop when the employee is required to travel outside regular
work hours, and that travel takes him or her away from the official duty station. If the travel
meets criteria for one of the four conditions described in paragraph A20.1, the travel time is
considered hours of work and payable; if not, the travel time is not payable, and the reasons for
requiring the travel must be recorded.

                                         Attachment 21
      TRAVEL TIME AS HOURS OF WORK FOR THE NONEXEMPT EMPLOYEE

A21.1. General Information.
   A21.1.1. Whether time spent in authorized travel by an employee is to be considered hours
   of work depends on the kind of travel involved. This attachment contains basic principles for
   determining whether travel time is properly considered hours of work, when the travel is:
       A21.1.1.1. From home to work (work to home).
       A21.1.1.2. Within the limits of the employee’s official duty station.
       A21.1.1.3. Away from the official duty station and the travel involves the performance
       of work while traveling (including travel as a driver of a vehicle).
       A21.1.1.4. Away from the official duty station as a passenger in a public or private
       conveyance. A further consideration for determining hours worked for travel as a
       passenger is whether the employee travels to, and returns from, a temporary duty station
       during the same day, or whether the employee remains overnight at the temporary duty
       station.
   A21.1.2. These instructions apply only to the time actually spent traveling between an
   employee’s official duty station and the point of destination, or between two temporary duty
   points, and for usual waiting time that interrupts such travel.
A21.2. Definitions.
   A21.2.1. Authorized Travel. Authorized travel is defined as travel that is performed:
Under the direction or control of a responsible official of the employing NAFI.

For the benefit of the employing NAFI.
   A21.2.2. Official Duty Station:
       A21.2.2.1. Official duty station has been defined in federal travel regulations as the
       employee’s designated post of duty, the limits of which will be: "....the corporate limits
       of the city or town in which the employee is stationed. If the employee is not stationed in
       an incorporated city or town, the official station is the reservation, station, or established
       area, or, in the case of large reservations, the established subdivision thereof having
       definite boundaries within which the designated post of duty is located."
A21.3. Home to Work Travel.
   A21.3.1. Hours of Work. Travel by an employee to and from work, before and after the
   regular workday, is a normal incident of employment. The usual travel from home to work is
   not counted as hours worked. However, there are some cases where an employee may
   perform an activity, as a requirement of his or her employing NAFI while traveling from
   home to work, that could result in such travel time being considered hours worked.
   A21.3.2. Official Duty Station:
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   447


       A21.3.2.1. Usually, an employee’s home to work travel to his or her usual duty location
       or a job site within the limits of the official duty station is not considered compensable
       hours worked. For instance, if an employee travels directly from his or her home to a job
       site, located within the official duty station instead of reporting to his or her normal duty
       location, this is considered the usual home to work travel and is not compensable.
       A21.3.2.2. The rules in this attachment are used to determine whether an employee is
       compensated for time spent traveling (in excess of the usual home to work travel) to a
       TDY station located outside the limits of the official duty station. When determining
       travel time entitlements, an employee may only have one "official duty station." If an
       employee reports to a headquarters located in one city, but usually works at a branch
       office or at various job sites located in another city, a NAFI may establish the place
       where the employee performs the greater portion of his or her duties as the employee’s
       "official duty station." In this case, the employee is not entitled to compensation for
       travel within the designated "official duty station."
   A21.3.3. At a TDY Station:
       A21.3.3.1. An employee is not compensated for the usual home to work travel. This
       same principle applies to the commuting time of NAFI employees while assigned to a
       TDY station overnight. The employee’s TDY station is equivalent to the official duty
       station during the period of the TDY assignment. Therefore, the time spent by the
       employee commuting from his or her temporary lodgings (hotel, motel, etc.) to the usual
       duty location, or to a job site within the limits of the TDY station, is considered home to
       work travel. It is not considered work time, unless it meets one of those specific
       conditions discussed in paragraph A21.1.1.
       A21.3.3.2. When an employee, for personal reasons, does not use temporary lodgings
       provided at a TDY station and commutes daily from his or her home (or from temporary
       lodgings other than those specified at the TDY station), the daily home to work travel
       (commuting time) is not work time. However, the employee’s travel time, in excess of
       the usual home to work travel, to and from the TDY station on the first day of the
       temporary duty assignment, is considered hours worked. Of course, such travel must
       meet the rules for compensable travel time discussed in paragraph A21.5.
   A21.3.4. While Driving a Passenger Vehicle. If an employee drives a passenger vehicle
   outside regular working hours (including outside corresponding hours on a non workday)
   from his or her home to a TDY station, the employee may only count as "hours of work" the
   time spent driving that is in excess of the usual home to work travel. This deduction of the
   normal home to work travel is also proper when the driver of a passenger vehicle picks up
   and drives another employee or a group of employees directly to a TDY station, if the driver
   was not required to do so by the employing NAFI. If the employee drives from his or her
   home directly to temporary lodgings at the TDY station (or between lodgings at one TDY
   station and another TDY station), this travel is not considered home to work travel and,
   therefore, is not deducted from compensable travel time.
A21.4. Travel Within the Limits of the Official Duty Station. Time spent by an employee in
authorized travel, as part of a job assignment during the workday, is considered travel that is all
in the day’s work. Such travel time is counted as hours worked. This rule applies to time spent
traveling by an employee (either as a driver of a vehicle or as a passenger in a vehicle) during
448                                                      AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


regular working hours, within the limits of the official duty station. Also, when an employee
must travel before or after regular working hours within the limits of the official duty station as a
part of a job assignment that extends the employee’s regular tour of duty, the time spent traveling
is also considered hours worked. The usual home to work (work to home) travel and bona fide
meal periods are not included in hours worked.
A21.5. Travel Away From Official Duty Station.
   A21.5.1. Work Done While Traveling. Any work that an employee must do while
   traveling is counted as hours worked. When an employee is required by an employing NAFI
   to drive a vehicle, pilot an aircraft, or (when the seaman exemption does not apply) pilot a
   boat to a given destination, the time spent traveling is counted as hours worked. An
   employee who rides on such trips and who is required to help in operating the conveyance is
   working while riding, and such time spent traveling is similarly counted as hours worked.
   Also, any other employee required to work while traveling must have the time spent traveling
   counted as hours worked. Bona fide meal periods are deducted from hours worked. Under
   certain conditions, sleeping periods or periods when an employee is relieved from duty are
   not included in hours worked.
       A21.5.1.1. When an employee is required to be on duty (traveling continuously) for 24
       hours or more, authorized sleeping periods of not more than 8 hours may be deducted
       from hours worked, if adequate sleeping facilities are furnished and the employee can
       usually enjoy an uninterrupted period of sleep. However, if the sleeping period is
       interrupted by a call to duty, the interruption must be counted as hours worked and if the
       employee cannot get at least 5 hours sleep during the sleeping period, the entire time is
       working time.
       A21.5.1.2. When an employee is completely relieved from duty for a period long enough
       to enable the employee to use the time effectively for his or her own purpose, this off-
       duty period is not hours worked. For example, driver of an automobile terminates his or
       her travel at 0600 the next morning; or a security specialist guarding classified equipment
       aboard a train is relieved from duty at 1800 and is not scheduled to report for duty until
       0600 the next morning.
   A21.5.2. Travel as a Passenger on a One-Day Assignment. Travel as a passenger to and
   from a TDY station, outside the limits of the official duty station during the same day, is
   viewed as a part of the employee’s principal duties for that particular day. The time spent in
   authorized travel as a passenger (by common carrier or by automobile) during the 1-day
   assignment is considered working time. Bona fide meal periods are deducted from hours
   worked. The unusual home to work (work to home) travel and time spent waiting at a
   common carrier terminal in excess of the normal waiting time, which occur outside regular
   working hours, are not included in hours worked.
       A21.5.2.1. A common carrier may require an employee to arrive at a common carrier
       terminal at a designated predeparture time (for example, 30 minutes before the scheduled
       departure time of the common carrier). Such waiting time at the common carrier, from
       designated predeparture time until scheduled departure time of the common carrier, is
       counted as hours worked. Also, if an employee has to wait for a connecting flight at an
       intervening common carrier terminal to continue traveling to a TDY station, the usual
AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   449


       waiting time at the intervening common carrier terminal is considered the usual waiting
       time and is counted as hours worked.
   A21.5.3. Travel as a Passenger That Keeps an Employee Away From Official Duty
   Station Overnight. When an employee must travel as a passenger to a TDY station outside
   the limits of the official duty station and must remain at the TDY station overnight, such
   travel is in excess of the 1-day assignment and, therefore, is considered to be travel that keeps
   an employee away from an official duty station overnight.
       A21.5.3.1. When an employee travels during regular working hours on regular
       workdays, the time spent traveling is considered hours worked. This rule also applies
       when an employee travels as a passenger during corresponding hours on a non workday
       (hours that correspond to an employee’s regular working hours on regular workdays).
       A21.5.3.2. When an employee travels as a passenger outside regular working hours (and
       outside corresponding hours on non workdays), the time spent traveling is not considered
       hours of work, if the travel keeps the employee away from the official duty station
       overnight and the employee performs no work while traveling. Thus, if an employee
       regularly works from 0900 to 1730 (with a 30-minute meal period), from Monday
       through Friday, travel performed during these hours on any of the 7 days of the
       workweek (including travel time on Saturday, Sunday or a holiday), is working time.
       Bona fide meal periods are deducted from hours worked. Time spent waiting at a
       common carrier terminal, in excess of the usual waiting time that occurs during
       corresponding hours on non workdays, is not included in hours worked.
A21.6. Special Situations.
   A21.6.1. Travel by Mode of Transportation Other Than That Selected by the
   Employing NAFI. When an employee, for personal reasons, such as an aversion to flying,
   does not use the mode of transportation selected by the employing NAFI, the employee is
   credited with the lesser of that portion of the:
       A21.6.1.1. Actual travel time that is considered work time, under these instructions; or
       A21.6.1.2. Estimated travel time that would have been considered work time, under
       these instructions, had the employee used the mode of transportation selected by the
       employing NAFI.
   A21.6.2. Travel at a Time Other Than That Selected by the Employing
   NAFI. Employing NAFIs must specify, within reasonable limits, the time during which
   authorized travel must be performed by its employees. To the maximum extent practicable,
   the travel of an employee away from official duty station is scheduled within the employee’s
   regularly scheduled workweek. When an employee, for personal reasons, travels at a time
   other than the time selected by the employing NAFI or, for personal convenience, travels by
   an indirect route or interrupts such travel, the employee is credited with the lesser of that
   portion of the:
       A21.6.2.1. Actual travel time considered work time, under these instructions; or
       A21.6.2.2. Estimated travel time that would have been considered work time, under
       these instructions, had the employee traveled at the time and by the route selected by the
       employing NAFI.
450                                                     AFMAN34-310 28 SEPTEMBER 2011


      A21.6.3. Travel That Involves Two or More Time Zones. If an employee’s travel
      involves two or more time zones, the time zone from the point of the first departure for the
      workday is used to determine whether the employee performed the travel during regular
      work hours (or during corresponding hours on non workdays). For example, an employee
      commences travel on Monday in Washington DC, with a short stop-over in Denver,
      Colorado, and then travels to Los Angeles, California, later that same day. The eastern time
      zone (point of first departure for that workday) is used to determine whether the travel was
      performed during the employee’s regular working hours. If the same employee later returns
      from Los Angeles, California, to Washington DC, on Saturday (a non workday), the pacific
      time zone is used to determine whether the travel was performed by the employee during
      hours that correspond to his or her regular work hours.
