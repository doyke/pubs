SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been changed substantially for compliance with AFOSH Standard 48-137
IC2, dated 7 April 2009, and must be reviewed in its entirety. Changes/revisions include
changes to responsibilities, emergency escape respirator selection, specific documentation
requirements, and procedures for Quantitative Fit Testing (QNFT) military gas masks.
1. Policies.
     1.1. Use of Respirators. RP will be worn where specified by an applicable directive or when
     required in writing by 75 AMDS/SGPB. The requirement to wear RP will be validated by
     the results of air sampling conducted in the workplace. 75 AMDS/SGPB will make a
     determination when the policy requirement is not explicit and will work with the supervisor
     to request clarification or change, AFTO Form 22, Technical Manual (TM) Change
     Recommendation and Reply. In work situations where timely air sampling is not feasible, 75
     AMDS/SGPB may require RP based on observation of the work process, professional
     judgment, and experience.
        1.1.1. Respirator Certification. RP used under this program will be certified by the
        National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Certification numbers
        are prefixed with the letters TC (Test Certification) followed by numerical sequence.
     1.2. Written RPP. All workplaces where RP is used must establish a written RPP IAW
     AFOSH Standard 48-137. At Hill AFB, the workplace Respiratory Protection Operating
     Instruction (RPOI) will be written and provided by 75 AMDS/SGPB. Supervisors will
     coordinate on the RPOI annually.
     1.3. Type of Respirator. The type of RP to be used in workplaces will be specified by 75
     AMDS/SGPB personnel. RP will be deemed required if directed by an AF Technical Order
     (T.O.) or a substance-specific instruction/regulation or a 75 AMDS/SGPB workplace
     evaluation. No elective-use RP will be worn; however, Filtering Face Piece Devices
     (FFPDs), commonly called “dust masks,” may be used when authorized in writing by 75
     AMDS/SGPB for comfort use when no documented health hazard exists. All personnel must
     go through their supervisor to obtain an FFPD; however, those supervisors must first attend
     the Supervisor Training Course 1767 (MHPMED0001767SU) before allowing their
     employees to wear FFPDs.
     1.4. RP for Disease Prevention/Control. If a disease outbreak occurs, the type of mask and
     personnel required to wear them will be in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health
     Administration (OSHA) requirements, 29 CFR 1910.134. Use of surgical masks by
     individual workers/patients to prevent infection is not controlled by this regulation.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. Unit Commanders or Officers in Charge. Establish and conduct an installation RPP
     conforming to the requirements of this standard and applicable OSHA standards when RP is
     required and used within their organization.

       wearing a tight-fitting RP.
       2.9.5. Perform positive and negative pressure checks in a “clean air” environment each
       time the RP is donned.
       2.9.6. Do not wear normal eyeglasses or gas mask inserts with tight-fitting full-face
       piece RP. 75 AMDS/SGPE can assist with procurement of appropriate eyeglass inserts.
       OSHA allows the use of contact lenses where individuals have successfully worn such
       lenses in the past (see OSHA Technical Manual, Section VII: Chapter 2 for additional
       guidance).
       2.9.7. Inspect all RP or supplied-air system components before each use and perform
       necessary cleaning and maintenance as prescribed by 29 CFR 1910.134 and AFOSH
       Standard 48-137.
          2.9.7.1. (OO-ALC Only) Employees will clean respirators per the workplace-
          specific respirator operating instruction (OI) after each use using a non-alcohol
          respirator wipe.
          2.9.7.2. (OO-ALC Only) Employees will turn-in respirators for thorough cleaning
          by using the Hazmart respirator cleaning facility service after every 8 hours of
          accumulated use (to coincide with filter cartridge replacement).
          2.9.7.3. Ensure breathing air hoses are stored so that openings are not contaminated
          with paint, loose blasting media, dirt, etc. Breathing air hoses must be capped when
          not in use.
          2.9.7.4. Hill organizations not using the OO-ALC respirator cleaning facility will
          ensure that all tight fitting RP are cleaned in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134, on
          at least a weekly basis if used during that week.
          2.9.7.5. Blast helmets and non-disposable supplied-air hoods should be cleaned after
          each work day, properly stored, and maintained according to manufacturer’s
          recommendations or BE approved local procedures.
       2.9.8. For initial fit tests, complete and provide medical questionnaire to 75
       AMDS/SGPO soon as possible. NOTE: Under no circumstances will a worker be fit
       tested with RP without being medically cleared by a PLHCP.
3. Selection, Use, and Limitations.
   3.1. Personnel will be placed on the RPP only for protection against significant airborne
   chemical, biological, and radiological exposures. Additionally, emergency response
 8                                                           HILLAFBI 48-102 1 APRIL 2014


     personnel may be required to wear specific RP for CBRNE responses (reference the shop-
     specific RPOI).
     3.2. 75 AMDS/SGPB quantifies potential exposures. If the hazard cannot be controlled via
     engineering or administrative controls, 75 AMDS/SGPB will select the type of RP (e.g.,
     SCBA full or half-face air purifying and supplied air), cartridge, or canister type most
     suitable for controlling exiting hazard and specify when the cartridge/canister must be
     changed based on estimate of service life from specific manufacture databases or using
     professional judgment. If personnel are concerned about potential chemical, biological, or
     radiological hazards they should contact 75 AMDS/SGPB.
     3.3. The work center must procure RP of the same manufacturer, model, and size for which
     shop personnel are fitted.
4. Emergency-Use Respirators.
     4.1. If personnel believe emergency-use RP are required for egress, the shop supervisor must
     contact 75 AMDS/SGPB. 75 AMDS/SGPB will review emergency/spill scenarios and select
     the best egress RP, if one is required.
     4.2. Tight-fitting SCBA with backpack style tanks are not adequate egress RP and will not
     be used for egress purposes.
     4.3. 75 AMDS/SGPB and 775 CES/CEF personnel must review other emergency scenarios
     (e.g., rescue and spill response) prior to purchase of emergency-use RP.
     4.4. A monthly inspection (every 30 days) is required for SCBA, air-line, and any other
     emergency-use RP. This inspection must be documented on an AF Form 1071, Inspection
     and Maintenance Record.
5. Training.

6. Fit Testing. 75 AMDS/SGPB and/or 75 AMDS/SGPO will ensure all fit testing is
accomplished, including quantitative and qualitative fit testing. All fit testing will be performed
at Building 249. 75 AMDS/SGPO is required to use US Air Force School of Aerospace
Medicine (USAFSAM) mandated standard RP names and models in Defense Occupational and
Environmental Health Readiness System (DOEHRS). Supervisors must coordinate all fit testing
with 75 AMDS/SGPB and/or 75 AMDS/SGPO before individuals report for fit testing. Under
no circumstances will individuals be fit tested if not medically cleared by the occupational health
consultant or other PLHCP.
7. Respirator Cleaning Facilities. All respirator cleaning facilities must clean RP in
accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134. Shops with large numbers of RP are encouraged to have
their RP cleaned and serviced at the OO-ALC Respirator Cleaning Facility, Building 535. The
respirator cleaning facility in Building 535 is a contractor run operation funded under the OO-
ALC. Non OO-ALC organizations wishing to utilize this capability should contact the Base
Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight and the OO-ALC Contract Management Office (OO-
ALC/OBC).
   7.1. 75 AMDS/SGPB will inspect all respirator cleaning facilities annually to ensure
   compliance with 29 CFR 1910.134.
   7.2. (OO-ALC Only) . Supervisors will ensure all employees using tight-fitting RP turn in
   RP to the OO-ALC Respirator Cleaning Facility after eight hours of total use.
   7.3. (OO-ALC Only) Organizations wishing to receive the same respirators back should
   attach a waterproof tag (or metal dog tag) to the respirator identifying the servicing Hazmart,
   building number, organization, and employee name. All efforts will be made to return
   original respirators, though this cannot be fully guaranteed.
   7.4. (OO-ALC Only) Respirator drop-off/pick-up locations will follow the guidance at the
   following         link        for      management       of         this       operation:
   https://org.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/309MXW/OSHA/Regulations%20and%20Guidence/For
   ms/AllItems.aspx.
8. Administrative Procedures. Shop supervisors will maintain access to RPP documents. This
must include the following: AFOSH Standard 48-137, Hill AFB Instruction 48-102, the shop’s
RPOI provided by 75 AMDS/SGPB, copies of each individual AF Form 2772, Certificate of
Respirator Fit Test, or equivalent T.O. 42B-1-22, Quality Control of Compressed and Liquid
Breathing Air, and copies of breathing-air sample results if supplied air respirators are used. If
an organization maintains material electronically, workers will be briefed how to access the
information. The OO-ALC Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) system maintains access to a
number of these documents. NOTE: A copy of T.O. 42B-1-22 is only required to be
maintained if the breathing air is supplied by compressor or air bottle.
9. Program Evaluation.
   9.1. 75 AMDS/SGPB will conduct an annual review of the shop RPP. These shop-level
   reviews will be incorporated into the program’s annual review that is reported in writing to
   the AMC and the ESOHC.
 10                                                           HILLAFBI 48-102 1 APRIL 2014


   9.2. The annual review of the shop RPP will normally be conducted during the 75
   AMDS/SGPB annual industrial hygiene survey visit. Military-unique shops, SFS and EOD,
   will be addressed individually in their shop-specific RPOI, reference 2.3.10.
10. CBRNE Protective Mask Quantitative Fit Testing (QNFT).
   10.1. Individuals needing a fit test can call 75 AMDS/SGPB at 777-4551 to schedule an
   appointment. Fit testing is performed on Mondays from 0900-1530 in 15-minute increments.
   Appointments may be made outside this window for special needs only; i.e., short notice
   deployments, mass fit-tests, etcetera.
   10.2. QNFT will be conducted in accordance with AFOSH Standard 48-137.
   10.3. The following is required of the individual being fit tested:
      10.3.1. Do not eat, drink (except water), smoke, suck on a cough drop, chew gum, or
      brush teeth 30 minutes prior to their appointment.
      10.3.2. Cologne/perfume should not be worn on the day of the appointment for it can
      hinder the test from giving an accurate result.
      10.3.3. If optical lenses/contacts are worn to perform duties, the inserts must be
      appropriate for the individual mask and brought to the appointment (contact lenses are
      not to be worn during the QNFT fit test). 75 AMDS/SGPB will not fit test individuals
      without special inserts appropriate to mask.
      10.3.4. Masks are fit to size so the individual is not required to bring their own mask.
   10.4. M-45 Land Warrior Masks. In accordance with QNFT and Training Program Policy
   letter, dated 25 June 2004: “Individuals declared hard-to-fit by 75 AMDS/SGPB and/or
   issued a M-45 Land Warrior, Chemical-Biological Mask will continue to deploy with same
   mask used for QNFT.” Once the individual has received their M-45, they must schedule an
   appointment with 75 AMDS/SGPB to be fit to that mask. Individuals issued the M-45 mask
   will retain possession of it between duty stations until he/she terminates active or reserve
   service.
   10.5. Currently, an individual’s unit funds must be used to order the CBRN protective masks
   and spare parts. Optical inserts (if applicable) are purchased through the 75 AMDS/SGPE.
