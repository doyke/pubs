                           INFOCON LEVELS

 The INFOCON system is a series of prescribed and standardized
 actions to maintain or reestablish the confidence-level of networks
 under a commander’s authority.

 INFOCON 5: Information networks are operational. Normal
 readiness of information systems and networks that can be
 sustained indefinitely.
 INFOCON 4: Limited risk to ongoing military operations.
 Operational impact of degradation or loss of information and
 information systems is LOW to MEDIUM. Impact to end-users is
 negligible.
 INFOCON 3: Risk to mission accomplishment is moderate.
 Requires vigilance to maintain network security. Impact to end-
 users is minor.
 INFOCON 2: Risk of mission failure is HIGH. Operational impact of
 degradation or loss of information and information systems is
 MEDIUM to HIGH. Impact to end-users could be significant for
 short periods, which can be mitigated through training and
 scheduling.
 INFOCON 1: Risk to mission operations is EXTREME. Operational
 impact of degradation or loss of information and information
 systems is HIGH. Impact to end-users could be significant for
 short periods, which can be mitigated through training and
