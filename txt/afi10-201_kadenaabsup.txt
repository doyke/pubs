access to the computer and the files. Note: Internet or local area network (LAN)-based files are
not considered “on-hand” as outages will render them inaccessible.
1.11.11.2.6. (Added)Provide a reply MFR of corrective actions taken in response to 18
WG/CPR-conducted staff assistance visits (SAVs). MFRs are due to the 18 WG/CPR no later

2.4.Any reportable change in a unit’s SORTS that occurs out-of-cycle from scheduled monthly
reporting must be approved by the measured unit commander. The change must also be
reviewed by, and briefed to, the applicable group commander and the wing commander
respectively. This review should occur before transmission of the change by 18 WG/CPR, but
may occur soon after if the review process will delay the 24-hour reporting requirement for out-
of-cycle SORTS reports. Only those SORTS worksheets and supporting documentation that
reflect the change(s) need to be included for an out-of-cycle report unless otherwise directed.
Note: Usually this will include updated over-all, measured area and remarks worksheets).
Contact 18 WG/CPR to set up a time to accomplish the out-of cycle report. If necessary, 18
WG/CPR can be contacted after duty hours by calling the Kadena Command Center at 634-1800.
2.4.1.The 18 WG units must accomplish SORTS reports in sufficient time to ensure the report is
ready for submission to 18 WG/CPR by the scheduled monthly appointment time. The
appointed time assures the wing commander reviews the SORTS data and 18 WG/CPR can
transmit SORTS on the last duty day of the month. 353 SOG units must accomplish SORTS
reports in sufficient time to ensure the report is ready for submission to the COMREP or 18
WG/CPR by their scheduled monthly appointment time(s). The appointed time assures the 353
SOG/CC reviews the reports on the Mondays before the 2nd Wednesday of each month when
COMREP or 18 WG/CPR will transmit them.
2.4.1.1.When an 18 WG unit misses their mandatory SORTS appointment, a no show letter will
be sent to the unit commander and the unit SORTS monitors. The unit’s group commander, the
18th Wing Director of Staff (18 WG/DS) and 18 WG/CV will also be courtesy copied on each
no show letter.
2.9.1.Units have an option of having the SORTS monitor or tasking unit orderly rooms
(personnel specialists) determine assigned/available personnel numbers and provide data to the
SORTS monitor in the form of an unclassified memorandum. Whichever method is used, the
unit manpower personnel roster (UMPR), UMD, and SORTS Desire listing must be used to
calculate and validate these numbers and provided to the unit SORTS Monitor for inclusion in
the report supporting documentation. Determine personnel availability in accordance with AFI
10-201, paragraph 3.2.
3.1.4.Non-Flying units complete SORTS in accordance with AFI 10-201, Chapter 3, using the
extract from the Manpower and Organization Office and the Personnel Desire List. Flying units
must also use the documentation provided by 18 MXG on PEC-coded AFSCs and provide this
documentation in supporting documentation for each report.
