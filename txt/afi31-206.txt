                                            Chapter 1

                                     RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Headquarters United States Air Force. HQ USAF/A7S determines how SF members
conduct criminal investigations throughout the Air Force.
1.2. Headquarters Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI). HQ AFOSI develops
guidelines on investigative jurisdiction within the US Air Force. It also manages the USAF
Polygraph Program. AFOSI and SFS work cooperatively on the Joint Drug Enforcement Team
(JDET) which is a drug enforcement initiative in which SF personnel serve with AFOSI special
agents on the installation’s drug suppression team.
1.3. Headquarters Air Force Security Forces Center (HQ AFSFC). HQ AFSFC provides
Air Force SF commanders with guidance on investigative matters.
    1.3.1. SF compiles information reportable under DoD Directive 5400.15, Obtaining
    Information from Financial Institutions.
1.4. Installation Defense Force Commander (DFC). The DFC will establish a SF
Investigations Section within their squadron to handle incidents and/or crimes as delineated in
Attachment 2, AFOSI and SF investigative matrix, as established by AFI 71-101, Volume I,
Criminal Investigations. The matrix is used as a guideline; however, AFOSI must be
immediately notified on all incidents falling within their investigative responsibility. AFOSI has
sole authority for deferring all matters falling within their investigative purview; however, if a
matter cannot be resolved by special agents and investigators, the decision on who will take the
case will be determined by the DFC and AFOSI special agent in charge/commander. The matrix
is not intended to remove discretionary authority from the DFC or AFOSI Special Agent-in-
Charge/Commander. The DFC should consider having SFI report directly to him/her to prevent
any possible conflict of interest with internal investigations. ANG may replace SFOI with
MOA/MOU with local and state Law Enforcement and responsible AFOSI detachment.
1.5. NCOIC of Investigations and/or Chief of Investigations (if civilian), roles and
responsibilities.
    1.5.1. Ensure Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) or similar information is disseminated
    appropriately.
    1.5.2. Brief senior leadership on relevant information for situational awareness affecting
    local area.
    1.5.3. Conduct Force Protection Intelligence quarterly training for SF personnel focused on
    local force protection intelligence issues. ANG may establish an MOA/MOU as needed to
    meet needs.
    1.5.4. Ensure liaison is maintained with AFOSI and other local military bases. Coordinate
    with state and local civilian police agencies, when required.
    1.5.5. Monitor any criminal or threat trend analysis. Produce quarterly and annual trend
    analysis of suspicious activities, incidents, and criminal activity affecting the installation.
AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   5


   1.5.6. Serve as a member of the installation Threat Working Group. Attend weekly local
   Threat Working Group (TWG) meetings hosted by the local installation and other regional
   TWG meetings, as needed.
   1.5.7. Use unit Commander’s Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs) to determine the
   type of information required for known threats that may affect friendly forces and mission
   success.
   1.5.8. Ensure immediate dissemination of any potentially dangerous or pertinent information
   to squadron leadership received through intelligence channels.
   1.5.9. Ensure Force Protection Intelligence binders at all installation entry control points,
   Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC) are current.
   1.5.10. Review Commander’s PIRs annually or sooner if changes in the threat environment
   require them to be updated.
   1.5.11. Assist AFOSI in the development of the annual installation Defense Threat
   Assessment (DTA).
   1.5.12. Assign cases to be investigated.

   1.6.1. Assist in immediate dissemination of any potentially dangerous or pertinent
   information to squadron leadership received through intelligence channels.
   1.6.2. Update Force Protection Intelligence binders at all installation entry control points,
   Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC).
   1.6.3. Assist AFOSI in the development of the annual installation Defense Threat
   Assessment (DTA).
   1.6.4. Conduct investigations as assigned.

                                           Chapter 2

                   ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATIONS PROGRAM

2.1. Investigative Jurisdiction. SF members investigate all crimes, offenses or incidents falling
within their investigative jurisdiction as set forth in Attachment 2 and AFI 71-101 IC-1, Volume
I, Criminal Investigations. These cases may involve coordination with federal, local or host
nation law enforcement agencies/forces to complete a thorough investigation. SF may close out
cases AFOSI determines do not warrant further AFOSI investigation. If Attachment 2 and AFI
71-101 IC-1 matrix do not match, then AFI 71-101 matrix takes primacy.
    2.1.1. DFC or designated representative can coordinate with AFOSI to work other cases
    beyond Attachment 2. If AFOSI or SFI/S-2 initiates a case and it is later determined the
    other agency will take over the case, a written memorandum declining investigative
    responsibility by one organization and the acceptance of investigative responsibility by the
    other must be accomplished. AFOSI or SFI /S2I will then transfer all case file information
    and evidence to the other agency. SFI/S2I will keep these memorandums on file for a period
    of 12 months after close out of the case.
    2.1.2. When authorized, SF will provide investigative assistance to AFOSI. The AFOSI
    detachment commander or special agent in charge and DFC jointly make determinations of
    need.
    2.1.3. For guidance on search and seizure refer to AFI 31-201, Security Forces Standards
    and Procedures.
2.2. Training. Investigators/Detectives should complete the Military Police Investigator
Course, AFOSI Special Investigators Course, an overseas U.S. Army Major Command Military
Police Investigators Course, or have experience from an equivalent civilian course/position (e.g.
civilian police course/training).
    2.2.1. As a minimum investigation sections should have their own AF Form 797 for
    certification/training. See Attachment 9, for a sample AF Form 797. The position of
    investigator will have a 797 specific to their job.
    2.2.2. IAW the SF JQS, an investigator is awarded the SEI after completion of MPI School
    and 12 months of experience as a full-time investigator and the recommendation of the DFC.
    ANG traditional guardsman must fulfill 36 months prior to being awarded the SEI.
2.3. Credentials. The DFC issues an AF Form 688, Security Forces Investigator Credential, to
SF investigators (military) in the rank of senior airman or above as well as for detectives
(civilian).
    2.3.1. Issue credentials to the graduates of the Military Police Investigator Course, AFOSI
    Special Investigators Course or of an overseas US Army Major Command Military Police
    Investigators Course.
    2.3.2. The DFC may issue credentials to SF members who the DFC believes have the nec-
    essary technical expertise, formal education and/or training. Note: In the absence of a
    qualified Investigator, the DFC may issue credentials to persons with less experience or
AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                      7


   part-time investigators, provided the number of credentials issued does not exceed the
   number of authorized investigators. Formal training for these individuals is the goal.
   2.3.3. The DFC ensures SF investigators and DAF detectives carry the AF Form 688 in the
   performance of official duties only. Credentials are valid only as long as the holder is
   performing investigative duties within the issuing unit. The credential expiration date should
   generally not exceed three years from date of issue.
       2.3.3.1. Destroy withdrawn credentials upon change of duty status or reassignment.
       Document credential destruction on AF Form 310, Document Receipt and Destruction
       Certificate, and maintain the certificate with other AF Form 688 accountability records.
       Note: The DFC may present an Investigator their credentials as a change of duty station
       or retirement memento. When done, the commander must render the credentials
       unserviceable. Marking the credentials in red block letters "INVALID" or encasing them
       in poured acrylic are two options.
       2.3.3.2. Ensure control and protection of blank credential forms against theft and
       unauthorized use. If blank or issued credentials are lost or stolen an investigation will be
       conducted and documented via ROI or AF Form 3545A, Security Forces Incident Report.
   2.3.4. 0083 Detectives are employed by Security Forces Squadrons. They will be issued a
   Department of the Air Force (DAF) Detective Badge (similar to ―DAF police badge‖ sample
   in AFI 36-801, Chapter 3, Uniforms for DAF SF Civilian Police and Guards) in lieu of the
   Security Forces Shield which will be funded by the issuing unit. 0083, Detectives have the
   same authority, jurisdiction, and limitations covering a normal Security Force member.
2.4. Uniform Wear. It is highly encouraged investigators/detectives not wear the military
uniform with the SF shield while performing investigative duties. SF military investigators and
civilian detectives are authorized to wear civilian clothes when performing investigative duties
with DFC approval. Protecting the grades of investigators/detectives and the wear of civilian
clothing are part of an overall effort to achieve efficiency in the investigative office. SF
investigators/detectives interact daily, often in an adversarial role, with individuals who are
junior and senior in grade to them. Military investigators will maintain a duty uniform/gear
immediately available. If SF Investigators are required to wear ABUs/BDUs and if authorized by
DFC, may wear BDUs/ABUs with no rank or function badge (i.e. OSI). Civilian attire when
worn will be casual and in good taste. Military active duty personnel permanently assigned as
investigators may be authorized a one-time initial civilian clothing allowance as determined by
the DFC, IAW AFI 36-3014, Clothing Allowances for Air Force Personnel, paragraph 3.3.1, and
Department of Defense Regulation 7000, 14-R, vol 7, chapter 29, Financial Management
Regulation..
   2.4.1. Civilian dress allows SFI to communicate by dissolving barriers, bias, anger and
   disdain toward the military that may arise during contact with potential sources and/or
   suspects. Civilian dress will put SFI at an advantage and not portray an authoritative military
   image. This gives investigators the appearance of being on the same level as civilian
   personnel. This also gives a psychological advantage during interviews; civilian dress allows
   the interviewer to be on equal footing with the interviewee. An interviewer cannot influence
   the interviewee by the use of his/her rank. A subject/suspect cannot influence the interviewer
   by the use of his/her rank and therefore in court relay he was fearful/coerced into a false
   admission. SFI is prepared to interview anyone at any given time. Civilian clothes allow SFI
8                                                          AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009


    to retain a certain amount of anonymity. You should never address another investigator by
    his/her rank when dealing with subjects/suspects. Studying name and rank on a uniform can
    stick in the mind of the offender, presenting possible future threats/crimes against the
    investigator.
    2.4.2. The DFC may authorize the purchase of specialized clothing for crime scene
    processing and evidence retrieval (i.e. overlarge jumpsuits and rubber boots) which can be
    worn over normal clothes.
    2.4.3. Members will wear the SF shield affixed to the belt while armed or on duty, when it
    does not interfere with the performance of their duties.
    2.4.4. Air Force civilian employees assigned as investigators wear the DAF police badge
    when performing official duties in civilian clothing, when it does not interfere with the
    performance of their duties.
    2.4.5. Installation DFC may authorize the use of locally procured clothing items with shield
    or POLICE embroidered for use while on duty in civilian clothes. DFC may also authorize
    the appropriate winter/cold weather attire for DAF civilian detectives.
2.5. Arming. Investigators/detectives often respond to incidents within moments of a flight
response in order to immediately secure the crime scene. SF investigators/detectives are
authorized to carry firearms in the performance of daily official duties with the approval of the
flight chief or NCOIC/Chief of Investigations, if the DFCs delegates responsibility. When
armed, investigators/detectives must carry their credentials and AF Form 523, if concealed.
Investigators/detectives do not routinely conceal their weapons unless necessary to protect the
integrity of an investigation with the approval of the DFC or designee. When a weapon is openly
displayed in civilian clothes, the SF Shield or DAF badge will be clipped next to the holster for
quick identification. IAW DOD Directive 5210.56 Para 4.1, Use of Deadly Force and the
Carrying of Firearms by DoD Personnel Engaged in Law Enforcement and Security Duties,
―DoD personnel regularly engaged in law enforcement or security duties shall be armed.‖ The
DFC may authorize the storage of investigator firearms and ammunition within their duty section
if all storage requirements are met IAW AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense. If SFI stores weapons
outside of the SF Armory, then local procedures must be developed to ensure security of the
weapons, notification and approval for non-duty hour usage, and clearing procedures are being
met. Investigation personnel must also comply with all clearing procedures and requirements as
set forth in AFMAN 31-222, USAF Weapons Handling Manual and comply with AFI 31-207,
Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, when carrying weapons openly or concealed.
If approved by DFC and available investigators/detectives may be issued an M-11. It is highly
encouraged investigators be armed whenever they respond.
    2.5.1. IAW AFI 31-2226, Combat Arms Program, credentialed SF investigators will be
    assigned, as a minimum, the M9 pistol as their primary duty weapon. SF investigators must
    qualify on the M9 Air Force Qualification Course (AFQC) with Air Force Air Provost
    ensemble standard issue gear. SF investigators must qualify on the AFOSI Practical Pistol
    Course (PPC) using a concealed carry holster. SF investigators must qualify on the AFOSI
    PPC prior to being authorized to carry a concealed firearm. If mission requirements dictate
    an immediate need for an authorization for concealed carry, the AFOSI PPC will be fired
    prior to carrying the M9 concealed without regard to the previous AFQC qualification date.
    Once initial AFOSI PPC qualification has been completed, and with commander approval,
AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                     9


   the AFQC/AFOSI PPC cycles will continue to qualify the SF investigator for concealed
   carry. Based on manpower or operations tempo, SF commanders may allow current SF
   investigators a waiver to the PPC until the next firing cycle.
   2.5.2. IAW AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force, Chapter 2, investigators not in uniform
   who have to openly bear firearms when performing official military duties must:
       2.5.2.1. Obtain an AF Form 523, USAF Authorization To Bear Firearms.
       2.5.2.2. Carry the AF Form 523, when armed.
       2.5.2.3. Surrender the form to the issuing authority when you complete the duties
       requiring you to bear a firearm.
   2.5.3. The AF Form 523 must have standardized permit numbers. For example, 37SFS 08-
   0002 (CONCEALED) refers to the 2nd concealed permit issued in 2008 by the 37th Security
   Forces Squadron at Lackland AFB, Texas.
   2.5.4. The AF Form 523 issued for off-base operations require full frontal face photographs.
   All others contain the statement "VALID ON (INSTALLATION NAME) ONLY."
   2.5.5. The expiration on the AF Form 523 will not exceed the expiration date on the
   Investigator’s AF Form 688, Security Forces Investigator Credential or as long as the DFC
   authorizes. Note: All qualifications are still required to be maintained even if the expiration
   on the AF Form 523 is longer than the qualification.
2.6. Reimbursement. SF investigators submit an SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for
Expenditures on Official Business, for all reimbursable expenses incurred while conducting an
official investigation. DFCs must pre-approve reimbursement for expenses incurred while
conducting an investigation.
   2.6.1. With authorization from the Installation DFC, the SF Investigations office may
   maintain its own Contingency funds account. Contact your local legal office for further
   guidance. This account will be established and maintained in coordination with the
   squadron's Resources Advisor, and the base Comptroller Squadron to ensure all financial
   management instructions are followed.
   2.6.2. MAJCOMs/Wings may program and fence funds for the above expenses each fiscal
   year. The DFC or designee will oversee expenditures.
2.7. Handling Evidence. DFCs appoint evidence custodians in writing. You must positively
identify and strictly account for evidence to assure admissibility for legal proceedings.
   2.7.1. Investigators must ensure the following procedures are met:
       2.7.1.1. Ensure the first law enforcement officer assuming custody or finding evidence
       marks the evidence itself for future identification. The marking will consist of time and
       date of acquisition and the initials of the person who assumes custody of the evidence. Do
       not mark items of evidence when doing so would reduce the evidentiary or financial
       value of the item. In those cases, place the item in a sealed bag or container and mark the
       bag or container with the time and date seized and initials of the person seizing the item.
       Caution must be taken in order to prevent cross-contamination of evidence at all levels of
       evidence processing.
10                                                        AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009


     2.7.1.2. An AF Form 52, Evidence Tag, will be attached to each item of evidence or
     evidence container as soon as possible after collecting items of evidence to identify and
     control them. The investigator will thoroughly describe the evidence and identify each
     person who has had custody of the item. Evidence may be consolidated on one AF Form
     52, provided the evidence is collected by the same person, at the same place, and as part
     of the same case. Only evidence of the same type should be on each evidence tag. (e.g., if
     you seize a dry blood stain on a carpet, victim’s clothing, drug paraphernalia and
     incriminating documents they should be put on different evidence tags due to then being
     sent to different offices in USACIL or other labs.) The investigators will have to split the
     tags later to separate the evidence. If multiple AF Forms 52 are used, number them
     consecutively (e.g., 1 of 3, 2 of 3). Ensure you maintain the chain of custody.
     2.7.1.3. Except in unusual circumstances, physical evidence will be released to the
     evidence custodian no later than the first working day after it is acquired. The evidence
     will be controlled by the person securing it until released to the custodian. Activities
     served by an evidence custodian in a separate location will release the evidence either
     physically, by registered mail, or by a recognized major U.S. commercial shipping
     service with an accountable tracking system (for example, FedEx, DHL, UPS, Airborne
     Express) to the servicing evidence custodian normally within 2 working days after the
     evidence is acquired.
     2.7.1.4. Record all evidence in ink in a permanently bound evidence log with
     consecutively numbered pages. Do not remove pages from the log or erase entries. Do
     not use correction fluids or correction tape. Draw a line through mistakes and initial
     them. If the Security Forces Information Management System (SFMIS) releases an
     evidence-tracker, that will be the only electronic evidence log authorized. If an electronic
     evidence log occurs due to SFMIS, evidence accountability will be done via
     Memorandum for Record.
     2.7.1.5. Store evidence in lockers, safes, or rooms designated solely for that purpose.
     Designate such areas as Controlled areas and comply with the requirements of AFI 31-
     101, Integrated Defense. Develop procedures to make evidence storage containers or
     rooms accessible only to the evidence custodian(s). Found Property must be stored
     separately from evidence when stored in the same room.
        2.7.1.5.1. When evidence is temporarily released from the evidence room for any
        reason (for example, sent to USACIL for examination, or provided for an Article 32
        hearing or court-martial), the original AF Form 52 will accompany the evidence.
        Annotate the location of the evidence in the evidence log.
     2.7.1.6. Store firearms and ammunition evidence in approved containers in the SF
     armory or Investigations office. Storage of this type of evidence outside the armory must
     be approved by the DFC in writing.
     2.7.1.7. Secure controlled substances (other than residue and paraphernalia) away from
     other evidence. If the evidence room does not meet physical security requirements,
     controlled substances will be secured in a GSA approved Class 5 safe (safe maybe
     located in same room as evidence).
AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                     11


           2.7.1.7.1. Weigh controlled substances upon receipt and disposal. Record the weight
           on AF Form 52. If the weight is so small as to be negligible, state this on the AF
           Form 52.
           2.7.1.7.2. Storage of drug evidence with military working dog training aids is
           prohibited.
           2.7.1.7.3. Controlled substances will not be annotated on a different AF Form 52
           than paraphernalia or other contraband.
       2.7.1.8. Conduct inventories of all evidence as determined locally, but at least quarterly,
       and inform the DFC in writing of discrepancies. Conduct an inventory when changing
       evidence custodians for both changes in the primary or alternate. Document the transfer
       of custodians in the front of the evidence logbook.
       2.7.1.9. Obtain written approval from the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) before disposing
       of evidence. Document the final disposition on evidence tags and in the evidence
       logbook. Have one witness present when SF destroys drugs or other items not returnable
       to the owner. Witnesses must be in the grade of E-7 or higher (appointed by the Mission
       Support Group Commander or designee) and may not be assigned to the SF squadron. It
       is recommended you have the local police department or other law enforcement agency
       destroy drugs and/or weapons.
       2.7.1.10. Send evidence directly to military, federal, or state forensic laboratories using
       DA Form 4137, Evidence/Property Custody Document and a DD Form 2922, Forensic
       Laboratory Examination Request. State-preferred forms may be used when using state
       facilities. Send evidence by certified mail, return receipt requested.
       2.7.1.11. Evidence being submitted to military, state, or federal laboratories will have the
       original AF Form 52 for the respective evidence included in the packaging to continue
       tracking the chain of evidence. If the evidence is sealed in an individual container, attach
       the evidence tag on the outside of the respective evidence container.
       2.7.1.12. All evidence, associated with the same case file, being sent for examination
       will be listed on the DA Form 4137, in the ―Description of Articles‖ block. The
       Description of Articles block must contain the evidence tag number, the description,
       condition, identification, and location from where it was seized. The description must
       match the description on the AF Form 52 evidence tag.
2.8. Receipt/Disposition of Property. When appropriate, SF may take custody of private or
government property not requiring the same degree of legal accountability as evidence. SF will
generally not take custody of property (except for weapons) left with another installation agency
(for example, luggage left by passengers at the passenger terminal, personal property left in or
around barracks, exchanges and commissaries). MAJCOM/A7S should establish guidelines on
conditions and circumstances under which their units accept lost, found or acquired property.
   2.8.1. Use an AF Form 52 as a receipt for lost, found, or acquired property.
   2.8.2. Use locally developed procedures to log and track this type of property. Use separate
   books for acquired and evidential material.
12                                                           AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009


     2.8.3. Store lost, found, and acquired property separately from evidence. Lost or found
     property may be stored in an evidence room. However, it must be clearly separated (i.e.,
     separate bin or shelf) from stored evidence.
     2.8.4. The Base Property Disposal Board (subject to Installation Commander approval) may
     choose to dispose of property in one of the following manners:
        2.8.4.1. Turn the item(s) in to the Defense Reutilization and Management Office
        (DRMO) in accordance with DoD Manual 4160.21, Defense Reutilization and Marketing
        Manual.
        2.8.4.2. Donate the item(s) to a military or private charity, for example, Airman’s Attic
        or Salvation Army.
        2.8.4.3. As otherwise directed by the Installation Commander or SJA, for example;
        destroy, convert to government use or through no cost contract with local
        business/agency (for disposal of abandoned vehicles).
     2.8.5. Regardless of disposal option(s) selected, you must still comply with the requirements
     of DoDM 4160.21, Defense Reutilization and Marketing Manual, regarding identification
     and notification of owners and the time frames required for holding property before
     disposition.
     2.8.6. Demilitarize all unclaimed firearms. Do this through turn in to DRMO or through
     destruction procedures found in DoD 4160.21-M-1, Defense Demilitarization Manual.
     Demilitarize all major assemblies to preclude reuse or reassembly with other parts.
     2.8.7. Retain money until the end of the calendar year, until funds exceed limits prescribed
     by the installation DFC, or release it immediately to the local finance office via AF Form 52.
2.9. Joint Drug Enforcement Team (JDET). AFOSI, in coordination with the installation
DFC and Installation Commander, may establish an AFOSI/SF JDET. Once formed, these teams
become the focal point for the Air Force anti-drug efforts at the installation level. The local
AFOSI detachment commander and installation DFC determine the type and extent of direct
participation the JDET will have in AFOSI operations. JDET members are OPCON/ADCON to
the host SF unit and TACON to the AFOSI detachment. JDET members are considered part of
the Investigations/S-2 branch.
     2.9.1. Joint Force Protection Team (JFPT): AFOSI, in coordination with the installation
     DFC and Installation Commander, may establish a JFPT. Once formed, these teams become
     the focal point for the Air Force anti-terrorism/force protection matters at the installation
     level. The local AFOSI detachment commander and installation CSF determine the type and
     extent of direct participation the JFPT will have in AFOSI operations. JFPT members are
     OPCON/ADCON to the host SF unit and TACON to the AFOSI detachment. JFPT members
     are considered part of the Investigations/S-2 branch.
2.10. Polygraph Support. Only AFOSI can conduct Forensic Physiological Detection of
Deception Examinations (FPDDEs) in support of SF investigations. Request FPDDE according
to AFI 71-101, Volume I. AFOSI XOUP is the office responsible to approve this support.
2.11. Field Testing Controlled Substances. If specifically trained (i.e. MPI, other formal drug
course(s) or localized training [conducted by OSI]), SF can field-test suspected marijuana,
AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    13


hashish, other cannabis products, phencyclidine (PCP) and cocaine. Contact AFOSI if a
suspected substance tests positive for an illegal substance.
   2.11.1. Determine field testing for other drugs on a case-by-case basis depending on SF and
   AFOSI responsibility for a particular investigation. Contact the servicing AFOSI office
   before conducting tests not specifically authorized above.
   2.11.2. SF may field-test other narcotics discovered during routine police actions at
   installations with no AFOSI presence. The servicing AFOSI detachment may provide
   specific training for these tests.
   2.11.3. SF investigators/detectives can get field-test training from their local AFOSI unit, by
   someone who has been trained or through local civilians who have been trained. Once
   training is complete annotate it on your AF 623A, OJT Continuation sheet, it is a one-time
   requirement.
   2.11.4. Training in field-testing for narcotics must address reading and recording of results,
   safety practices, and environmental considerations. Document this training as determined
   locally.
   2.11.5. SF Investigations will notify the local AFOSI detachment anytime they are con-
   ducting a drug related investigation.
2.12. Technical Surveillance Equipment. AFOSI is the sole Air Force agency authorized to
conduct interceptions of communications for Air Provost purposes as outlined in DoDD 5505.9,
Intercept of Wire, Electronic and Oral Communication for Law Enforcement, and AFI 71-101,
Volume I, Criminal Investigations. This prohibition does not affect administrative telephone
monitoring and recording (example: taping of all calls terminating at the Base Defense
Operations Center [BDOC]), closed circuit television for monitoring personnel entry to US Air
Force Restricted or Controlled Areas, monitoring inmates in a corrections facility, or for overt
video or audio equipment installed in a marked patrol vehicle.
   2.12.1. Security Forces investigators may engage in still photographic surveillance. Before
   engaging in any photographic surveillance, the DFC must review the surveillance plan and
   consult with the local SJA to ensure privacy concerns are addressed.
   2.12.2. Security forces personnel may only use video equipment overtly. This could include
   documentation of a crime or accident scene, line up, interview session, etc. Except for
   installed in-car video, disable the audio pickup of this equipment unless all personnel within
   recordable distance provide written consent. If there is a need to use video equipment
   covertly, you must request assistance from the local AFOSI.
2.13. Interviews. When conducting interviews, ensure you identify yourself as a Security
Forces investigator/detective. The investigator has no legal power to compel persons to divulge
information. However, you may ask them to disclose what they know. If a witness or
complainant refuses, ask the SJA for assistance.
   2.13.1. Before interviewing them, advise military suspects of their rights under Article 31,
   Uniform Code of Military Justice, when they are suspected of committing a crime. Use
   AFVA 31-231, Advisement of Rights, or the AF Form 1168, Statement of
   Suspect/Witness/Complainant. Failure to advise suspects of their rights may make their
   statements inadmissible in judicial proceedings. Before any rights advisement, investigators
14                                                             AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009


     must first determine whether a suspect has requested counsel for this or any previous matter.
     If so, contact the SJA before attempting the interview. Immediately cease the interview if the
     suspect asks to consult legal counsel. Make a note in the case file that the suspect invoked
     his/her right to counsel. Coordinate with the SJA office if for any reason you desire to
     attempt a later interview.
     2.13.2. For civilians (e.g. civil servants, NAF employees, contractors and privatized housing
     residents that are not military or military dependents) the law requires rights advisements
     under 5th Amendment, U.S. Constitution, for a custodial interview. When conducting a non-
     custodial interview on civilians, rights advisements are not mandatory. During a non-
     custodial interview, civilians must be told the offense they are suspected of, their
     participation is strictly voluntary, they may leave at any time and they don’t have to answer
     any questions. Ensure this is either being recorded or witnessed by another SF member.
     Note: During a Custodial interview, a person being interviewed would reasonably believe
     that they were not free to leave or terminate the interview. The person would believe they
     were being held in custody and not free to leave. (i.e. a suspect being held and questioned in
     locations such as: in an interview room, the back of a police car, under guard, or at the loss
     prevention office at the Base Exchange, but, this is not an all-inclusive list.).
        2.13.2.1. Seek the advice of the SJA before interviewing a DoD/DAF civilian suspected
        as the perpetrator of a criminal offense. According to the Weingarten Rights, union
        employees employed by the Department of Defense have the right to have a union
        representative present during questioning. Investigators do not need to advise union
        employees of their Weingarten Rights; however, if a union employee requests a union
        representative, investigators must cease the interview until the representative is present.
        Other factors with bearing on if and how you can interview a civilian include
        custodial/non-custodial status, location (overseas) and jurisdiction.
     2.13.3. If, after advisement, the suspect still does not understand his or her rights, reread the
     rights and attempt to explain what it means. If that does not resolve the problem, seek advice
     from the SJA office. Never threaten, trick or cajole a suspect into waiving his/her rights.
     2.13.4. Make every attempt to have a parent/legal guardian present during the rights
     advisement of a juvenile suspect. Seek SJA advice if you can’t locate a parent/legal guardian
     or they can’t respond in a timely manner. Stop the interview if the suspect (or parent/legal
     guardian in cases involving juveniles) requests an attorney. The suspect may consult with a
     lawyer and have a lawyer present during the interview. If the suspect initiates contact with SF
     after requesting a lawyer, contact the SJA for advice before asking any more questions. You
     must have another interviewer and/or witness present when the suspect is a juvenile or of the
     opposite gender of the interviewer. Whenever possible, ensure one of the two interviewers
     (or witness) is of the same gender as the suspect.
        2.13.4.1. When interviewing children you should be sensitive to the fact they are
        children. DFCs should attempt to send investigators/detectives to the Child Abuse
        Prevention and Interview Techniques course at Fort Leonard Wood, MO. If assistance is
        needed in interview techniques contact your local Family Advocacy Office.
     2.13.5. Following interviews with DoD personnel who are the subject of an investigation, SF
     investigators will release the individual to his/her first sergeant, commander, supervisor or
     their designee. The release must include person-to-person contact between the SF member
AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    15


   and unit representative, be immediate, and in writing. DD Form 2708, Receipt for Inmate or
   Detained Person, will suffice for this purpose.
       2.13.5.1. Commissioned Officers who are the subject of an investigation may only be
       released to their supervisor, commander, or designee.
   2.13.6. If any individual appears to be emotional, distraught or stunned following an
   interview, the interviewee will not be allowed to depart alone. The interviewee can only be
   released to his/her first sergeant, commander, supervisor or their designee. They will help
   ensure the individual receives the necessary support to safely handle his or her personal
   crisis.
2.14. Line ups. Line up policy can vary depending on jurisdiction, location, and local policy.
Contact your local SJA office for guidance on line up procedures.
2.15. Report of Investigation (ROI) (RCS: DD-P&R(M) 1973). For uniformity in reporting
under the Defense Incident Based Reporting System (DIBRS), complete via Security Forces
Management Information System (SFMIS) and attach AF Form 3545A, Incident Report, to all
ROI. You should then copy and paste the ROI to the AF Form 3545A. The case number will
stay the same as the initial report. Initiating a new case is the only time you would get a new
case number for your report. When writing an ROI, use the format in Attachment 3 to maintain
consistency with reports of other DoD investigating agencies.
   2.15.1. When forwarding completed ROIs and AF Forms 3545A outside SF channels, cover
   these documents with an AF Form 445, Security Forces Report of Investigation Cover Sheet.
   This cover sheet draws attention to the report and the responsibility on the part of the
   recipient to protect the potentially sensitive information contained in the report.
   2.15.2. SF Notes and Supporting Documentation. Must be included with the original case
   report and should enclose these documents in an AF FM 3986 if able, Case File Document
   Outer Envelope so they are not lost or misplaced. For smaller items which are placed in the
   AF Form 3986, place these items in an AF Form 3987, Case File Document Inner Envelope,
   to prevent them from getting lost and also keep them together. Restrict access to case notes to
   those with a need-to-know. NOTE: AFOSI is responsible for DCII indexing participants of
   SF investigations meeting the DCII indexing standard IAW DODI 5505.7, Titling and
   Indexing Subjects of Criminal Investigations in the Department of Defense (see paragraph
   4.11.1). The SF is responsible for providing complete and accurate identifying information
   for each participant that must be indexed. The local SF Analysis and Reports (SFAR) Section
   will provide AFOSI with all original documents for indexing and archiving.
2.16. Records Checks. SF may access personnel, Defense Eligibility Enrollment Reporting
System (DEERS), medical, dental and financial records in the performance of official
investigations. Use the AF Form 686, Substantive Investigations Record Check Summary, to
collect detailed information as required on each subject during the investigation. Maintain this
form with the completed ROI.
2.17. Release of Information. AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice, outlines Air
Force policy on the release of statements, confessions and other forms of information relating to
criminal proceedings. Consult the local SJA with questions.
16                                                             AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009


2.18. Informants. The SF Investigations Section may gather information through the use of
informants. When used, establish a central informant information file. Maintain complete
security over this file by securing it in a locked file cabinet. Access to this file will be limited to
the investigator, DFC, and as directed by court order.
     2.18.1. Instructions will be given to the informant, to ensure he/she knows when and how to
     contact the investigator for any type of emergency. The investigator should also know when
     and how to contact their informant. All informants training will be documented in the
     informant file. The informant will be given specific instructions and training before any
     tasks are given. They will be briefed on all safety precautions, what to do in an emergency
     and their limitations.     The investigator will ensure that the informant understands the
     difference between providing an opportunity for a suspect to violate the law versus providing
     the inspiration. They will additionally be trained on the law regarding entrapment.
     2.18.2. Generally, the defense of entrapment exists when the design or suggestion to commit
     the offense originated in the government and the accused had no predisposition to commit the
     offense. The ―government‖ includes agents of the government and individuals cooperating
     with the government, such as informants. The fact that individuals acting for the government
     afford opportunities or facilities for the commission of an offense does not constitute
     entrapment. Entrapment occurs when the criminal conduct is the product of the creative
     activity of government law enforcement agency activities. If you have any questions as to
     what entrapment is, contact the local SJA office.
     2.18.3. Maintain all known information on informants, including their background,
     occupation, attitude, motivation for cooperation, criminal record (if applicable), reliability
     and data on each case for which the informant has provided information. Also maintain
     information on each contact with the informant. This includes the time and place of each
     contact, individuals present, information provided by the informant, direction or tasking
     given by the Investigator and money spent, if any for the information provided. When writing
     information on informants, use the format in Attachment 4.
     2.18.4. The informant file, because of its confidential nature, is exempt from inspections
     unless specifically authorized by the DFC.
     2.18.5. Contact AFOSI if an informant desires to provide information for financial gain,
     provides information not in the investigative purview of the SF or has access to criminal
     activity that could result in their being threatened or harmed.
2.19. Field Interview (FI) Data. AF Form 3907, Security Forces Field Interview Data, will be
used to record routine contact between SF members and the public. Data obtained from the AF
Form 3907 should be compared by investigators against reported criminal activity to obtain
possible leads. Refer to your Security Forces Administration and Reports/S5R section for
disposition.
2.20. Defense Clearance and Investigations Index (DCII). The purpose of indexing a
participant (SUBJECT and Descendent) or entity (company) in DCII is to ensure that pertinent
information contained in an ROI is retrievable during future law enforcement or security
inquires.
     2.20.1. The DCII has a central file search and retrieval capability. SF investigators may
     request searches of DCII through their local AFOSI unit. This search discloses any DoD
AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                     17


   investigative files on individuals. Such searches provide valuable investigative leads and
   background on individuals involved in ongoing investigations or individuals considered for
   use as informants. If able, it is recommended investigations/S-2 branch attempt to get DCII
   access through their MAJCOM.
   2.20.2. Within the Air Force, AFOSI is the agency responsible for inputting data in the
   DCII. Security Forces Analysis and Reports/S-5 will provide originals of all completed
   reports of investigation, AF Form 3545A, and CVB Form 1805, United States District Notice
   Violation, for crimes meeting the DCII indexing standard IAW DODI 5505.7, Titling and
   Indexing Subjects of Criminal Investigations in the Department of Defense. AFOSI will be
   responsible for the filing and storage of these documents. Security Forces Analysis and
   Reports/S-5 will be responsible to answer any Freedom of Information Act requests made
   concerning these reports until AFOSI has taken complete control of the case and a copy of
   the report is no longer available.
2.21. Financial Investigations. DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5400.15, Obtaining Information from
Financial Institution, prescribes the procedures for the DoD to use in gaining access to financial
records maintained by financial institutions (banks, credit unions, etc.). SF Investigation
personnel seeking access to an individual’s financial records during an investigation (bad checks,
etc.) must first ask for the customer’s consent. DoDI 5400.15, Enclosures 3 and 10 establish the
exact format for consent.
   2.21.1. SF Investigation personnel seeking access to an individual’s financial records during
   an investigation may issue a formal written request for financial records when the records
   sought are relevant to a legitimate Air Provost inquiry. Issue this request only if the customer
   declined to consent to the disclosure of his/her records or if you determine that seeking
   consent from the customer would compromise or harmfully delay a legitimate Air Provost
   inquiry. Seek SJA guidance before using this procedure. DoDI 5400.15, Enclosures 4, 11
   and 13 establish the formal written request format. Strictly adhere to the customer
   notification procedure and waiting period specified in Enclosure 4.
   2.21.2. SF investigators who wish to obtain a subpoena for financial records needs to contact
   the local SJA. Ensure you notify AFOSI first, to see if it meets the requirement for them to
   assume control of the case.
   2.21.3. You may not transfer financial records obtained under the provisions of DoDI
   5400.15 to another agency or department outside the Department of Defense unless the head
   of the transferring law enforcement office or delegate certifies in writing there is reason to
   believe the records are relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry within the
   jurisdiction of the receiving agency or department. Maintain these certificates with the DoD
   component’s copy of the released records.
   2.21.4. Whenever incorporating financial data obtained under DoDI 5400.15 into an ROI or
   other correspondence, take precautions to ensure you make no distribution of the reports or
   correspondence outside the DoD except in compliance with procedures set forth in
   Enclosure 8 of DoDI 5400.15. The report or other correspondence must also contain an
   appropriate warning restriction on the first page or cover. DoDI 5400.15, Enclosure 8
   provides a suggested restrictive legend.
18                                                             AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009


     2.21.5. The provisions of DoDI 5400.15 do not govern obtaining access to financial records
     maintained by military banking contractors in overseas or other financial institutions in
     offices located on DoD installations outside the continental US, Puerto Rico, Guam, District
     of Columbia, American Samoa or Virgin Islands. In overseas areas it is preferable to obtain
     access to financial records maintained by military banking contractors by customer consent.
     2.21.6. Access to financial records maintained by all other financial institutions overseas by
     Air Provost activities must comply with local foreign statutes or procedures governing such
     access. NOTE: Financial institutions are only legally obligated to provide information in
     response to procedures that invoke search warrants or subpoenas. Compliance with other
     procedures (customer consent and formal written notification) is voluntary. If a financial
     institution is reluctant to release information, consult with your local SJA.
     2.21.7. All SF units must collect statistics (e.g. large deposits, withdraws, etc and how often)
     on requests for access to financial records held by financial institutions in accordance with
     the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978. Specifically, any request for financial records
     made during the course of an investigation, either by a suspect in cooperation with
     investigators or by use of other formal written request, must be reported in writing to the
     customer.
2.22. Investigation of Sexual Misconduct. See Attachment 2 for types of sexual misconduct
Security Forces Investigations/S2 may investigate.
     2.22.1. An action authority (normally the suspect’s commanding officer) evaluates
     allegations involving only adult private consensual sexual misconduct according to DoDI
     5505.8, Investigation of Sexual Misconduct by the Defense Criminal Investigative
     Organizations and Other DoD Law Enforcement Organizations. Action authorities normally
     dispose of such allegations without the investigative services of AFOSI or the SF. Installation
     SF may not initiate an investigation solely for an allegation of sexual misconduct between
     consenting adults.
     2.22.2. Before the initiation of any investigation into sexual misconduct, the DFC should
     meet with the SJA to ensure if SF investigation of the matter is in the best interests of the Air
     Force. If it is unknown who will handle the investigation, SF Investigations should have a
     representative during any questioning.
     2.22.3. You must limit investigations to the factual circumstances directly relevant to the
     specific allegation.
     2.22.4. Do not initiate an investigation to determine sexual orientation, that is, whether a
     service member is a heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual.
2.23. Victim/Witness Assistance Program (VWAP). According to DoD Directive 1030.1,
Victim and Witness Assistance; and DoDI 1030.2, Victim and Witness Assistance Procedures,
identification of victims and witnesses is the responsibility of the agency that investigates the
crime, e.g., SF, OSI. The term ―investigates‖ also applies to first responders. These two DoD
publications and AFI 51-201, Administration of Justice, provide guidance on the implementation
of these programs in the Air Force.
     2.23.1. Scope of VWAP. VWAP applies in all cases in which criminal conduct adversely
     affects victims or in which witnesses provide information regarding criminal activity. Pay
AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   19


  special attention to victims of violent crime, but ensure all victims and witnesses of crime
  who suffer physical, financial or emotional trauma receive the assistance they are entitled to.
  2.23.2. SF Role in VWAP. SF are critical members of a multi-disciplinary team. As first
  responders and investigators, Security Forces members contribute to the success of other
  team members (e.g. OSI, SJA, Chaplains) who follow during resolution of the incident.
  2.23.3. Security Forces Goals in VWAP. Security Forces goals are more far-reaching than
  effective first response. They are:
     2.23.3.1. Immediate and permanent termination of the harmful act(s).
     2.23.3.2. Favorable resolution of the incident. Incidents are considered favorably
     resolved when offenders have been identified and held accountable, and the victim has
     been referred to the appropriate agencies for assistance in recovering from the incident.
     2.23.3.3. Recovery of the victim. Complete recovery from an incident is largely
     dependent on a victim’s willingness to participate in the recovery process. Although SF
     cannot do the actual recovering for the victim, they can ensure the victim is properly
     treated and informed about available resources.
  2.23.4. Providing Information. Every SF member on-duty must carry a supply of the DD
  Form 2701, Initial Information for Victims and Witnesses of Crime. Distribute the DD Form
  2701 to any person meeting the requirements of paragraph 2.23.1. When in doubt as to
  whether a person meets the requirements to be issued a DD Form 2701, issue the form.
  Annotate the AF Form 3545(A) whenever a DD Form 2701 is issued. If no AF Form
  3545(A) is completed, then the SF Blotter must annotate a DD Form 2701 was issued.
     2.23.4.1. Provide all victims with reasonable ideas for protection. Examples of
     reasonable ideas for protection would be properly securing homes, work places and
     property. For victims of domestic violence or abuse, staying with family members or
     friends would be an example of a reasonable idea for protection.
     2.23.4.2. Brief all victims and witnesses on the four phases of the judicial process
     (response, investigation, prosecution and confinement) and provide them with
     information on what may be expected from them during each phase.
  2.23.5. SF, in conjunction with the base SJA, develop a training syllabus for local use that
  includes those items unique to the base and local area as well as any state law and available
  resources that might apply to the victim (e.g. SOFA agreements, age of adults, etc). This
  training applies to investigators and other Security Forces personnel as appropriate.
  2.23.6. If necessary, SF and AFOSI will provide protection or coordinate with other federal,
  state or local law enforcement authorities to protect the victim/witness. SF must notify the
  SJA when they identify a victim. This allows the SJA to administer the victim/witness assis-
  tance process.
  2.23.7. Units must "flag" incident reports to indicate it is a "victim/witness" case. Adding a
  prefix or suffix to the case number aids in the SJA auditing process of victim/witness cases.
  2.23.8. Per DoDI 6495.02, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Procedures, all SF
  personnel are required to complete initial and periodic training on responding to sexual
  assault incidents. The topics required to be covered in this training are listed in Enclosure
20                                                           AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009


     6.3.4 of DoDI 6495.02, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program Procedures.
     Annual completion of this training will be documented by the SF training section. A Tactics,
     Techniques, and Procedures Guide (TTPG) that covers all required topics is available on the
     HQ Air Force Security Forces Center web site.
2.24. Fingerprinting Suspects Under Investigation. DoD Instruction 5505.11 requires an FD-
249, Suspect Fingerprint Card, be submitted on all suspects under investigation by SF for
offenses listed in DoDI 5505.11, Fingerprint Card and Final Disposition Report Submission
Requirements, Enclosure 3, only when such offenses are disposed of by court-martial or
command action by an Article 15. For ease of operation, those offenses have also been listed in
Attachment 5. Units must obtain two complete sets of fingerprints on Forms FD-249, R-84, and
three photographs of military subjects: one frontal, one left and one right side. Attachment 5
provides guidelines to assist in determination of when to submit suspect fingerprints. Personnel
must ensure administrative data required on both forms is the same. Attachment 6 provides
instructions for completion of the FD-249. Attachment 7 provides instruction for completion of
form R-84. The address to send the fingerprint cards to is located on the FD-249 and R-84.
     2.24.1. Offender criminal history data records required under DoDI 5505.11 will be initiated
     by preparing and submitting FD-249 to the FBI. Submit the FD-249 when the commander
     initiates military judicial proceedings or takes action in nonjudicial proceedings against a
     military subject investigated for an offense listed in Attachment 5 of this document. Submit
     the FD-249 within 15 days of initiation of military judicial or nonjudicial proceedings.
        2.24.1.1. For civilian suspects submit form FD-249 within 15 days of arrest, indictment,
        or information, as applicable
     2.24.2. If final disposition of the proceedings is expected within 60 days, hold the FD-249
     and submit it with command action taken. If proceedings are expected to take longer than 60
     days, submit the FD-249 without command action and follow it up with FBI/DOJ Form R-
     84, Final Disposition Report, when action is taken. Do not delay filing the FD-249 past 60
     days.
     2.24.3. Send one completed Form FD-249 on military members to the FBI within 15 days
     after referral (not preferral) of court-martial charges or command action on an Article 15.
     NOTE: Do not confuse ―referred for action‖ (i.e., sent to the action authority), which appears
     on the ROI title page, with ―referral of court-martial charges,‖ which means the convening
     authority is ―referring‖ the case for trial by court-martial.
     2.24.4. Send the completed Form R-84 on military members to the FBI within 15 days after
     the SJA notifies you of final disposition of military judicial or nonjudicial proceedings.
     NOTE: Do not send Criminal History Data to the FBI for offenses disposed of by nonjudicial
     punishment if such punishment does not meet criteria outlined in Attachment 5.
        2.24.4.1. For civilian suspects submit Form R-84 within 15 days of sentencing.
     2.24.5. File the Forms FD 249 and R-84 when fingerprints are taken and the investigation
     does not result in the referral of court-martial charges or command action on an Article 15.
     2.24.6. If at any time after a Form FD-249 and R-84 is sent to the FBI, you determine an
     error has been made, or if appellate action changes the disposition, you must immediately
     notify the FBI. SF Investigations must send a memorandum to the FBI to have the
AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    21


   information corrected or withdrawn, as appropriate, within 15 days of notification of the
   appellate action. Include the FBI number, the Originating Agency Identification (ORI)
   number, file number, name and SSN of the subject with the correction or changed
   disposition. Send the letter to: Assistant Director, Criminal Justice Information Services,
   Federal Bureau of Investigation, 1000 Custer Hollow Rd, Clarksburg, WV, 26306-0001.
   2.24.7. Please refer to Attachment 5 for guidance on submitting criminal history and
   fingerprints of suspects.
   2.24.8. Approvals of requests for discharge, retirement or resignation in lieu of court-martial
   and/or a finding of lack of mental competence to stand trial shall be recorded as final
   disposition on either the FD-249 or R-84 as appropriate.
   2.24.9. Procedures for obtaining the necessary forms and training are found in DoDI
   5505.11.
   2.24.10. For identification purposes, suspects must submit to fingerprinting and photographs,
   regardless of requesting legal counsel or not. One photograph should be full face, the other a
   profile. File the fingerprints and photographs.
   2.24.11. In cases investigated jointly with another law enforcement organization when that
   organization agrees to obtain and forward fingerprints and criminal history data to the FBI,
   prepare a memorandum for the case file. The memorandum shall identify each subject and
   the law enforcement organization collecting and forwarding the data. Attach to the
   memorandum a copy of the submitted data.
2.25. Obtaining Bad Checks from AAFES. SF investigators/detectives may obtain copies of
bad checks from a local AAFES via the Fraud Watch program. The documentation can be
provided by either loss prevention personnel or management.
   2.25.1. Upon receipt of checks, the investigator will sign them into evidence. Once the
   checks are no longer required as evidence, the investigator will ensure they are destroyed
   appropriately.
2.26. Computer Crimes. SF investigators may seize the government CPU from the
Information Technology section of the suspects unit. The CPU should be secured via AF Form
52.
   2.26.1. Contact your local SJA to determine if a search authorization is needed before
   attempting the steps below (Para 2.26.2., 2.26.3. and 2.26.4.)
   2.26.2. The Investigator/Detective should make all attempts to copy the hard drive to an
   external hard drive.
   2.26.3. The investigator/Detective uses the external hard drive to search for evidence on the
   computer.
   2.26.4. If Investigations/S-2 requires assistance for the computer crimes, contact your local
   AFOSI office.
2.27. Fatal Vehicle Accidents. Fatal Vehicle Accidents without suspected homicide or suicide
are investigated by a certified traffic investigator. Due to the extreme nature of the accident
Investigations/S-2 can assist the traffic investigator and assist in answering questions the
22                                                            AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009


investigator may have. For further information on accidents refer to AFI 31-218(I), Motor
Vehicle Traffic Supervision.
2.28. Investigations/S-2 office recommendations: Based on the unit’s mission and the nature
of cases investigated, DFCs can consider the following assets for Investigations sections:
unfettered internet access, a landline dedicated to ―anonymous‖ tips, a dedicated line with an
―unlisted‖ number, and an assigned GOV.
2.29. Crime Scene Investigations: There is no steadfast rule that can be applied to defining the
dimensions of a crime scene. Valuable physical evidence is normally found at or near the site
where the most critical action was taken by the criminal against the victim or property. Crime
scene processing is important to meet legal requirements concerning evidence. The investigator
must identify each piece of evidence, describe the exact location of the item, indicate when the
item was collected, and maintain and show a proper chain of custody. The investigator or a
trained crime laboratory technician must also describe changes that may have occurred in the
evidence between the time it was collected and its introduction as evidence before the court.
     2.29.1. Conduct a crime scene assessment so the investigator in charge can determine the
     type of incident to be investigated and the level of investigation to be conducted. Plan for the
     coordinated identification, collection, and preservation of physical evidence and for the
     identification of witnesses. During the scene assessment, an exchange of information
     between law enforcement personnel can occur. The investigator in charge identifies specific
     responsibilities, shares preliminary information, and develops investigative plans according
     to policy; federal, state, and local laws; and the laws of the HN when applicable.
        2.29.1.1. Evaluate search and seizure issues to determine the necessity of obtaining
        consent to search and/or the requirement of obtaining a search warrant.
        2.29.1.2. Evaluate and establish a path of entry and exit to the scene to be used by
        authorized personnel, such as medical, HAZMAT, and other law enforcement agencies, if
        not already accomplished by the first responders.
        2.29.1.3. Determine and prioritize the number and size of the scene(s). Establish and
        maintain communication with personnel when multiple scenes exist.
        2.29.1.4. Determine and request additional investigative resources as required, such as
        personnel, specialized units, legal consultation, prosecutors, and equipment.
        2.29.1.5. Ensure that witnesses, suspects, and/or victims to the incident are identified and
        separated.
        2.29.1.6. Ensure that the surrounding area is canvassed and the results documented.
        2.29.1.7. Ensure that the preliminary documentation, such as notes, photographs, and
        sketches of the scene, is complete. The initial photographs should include any injured
        individuals and vehicles involved in the incident.
     2.29.2. Crime scene photographs. The crime scene is photographed as soon as possible and
     before any evidence is disturbed. Photographs are not a substitute for crime scene sketches.
     All photographs are documented in a photograph log with camera positions indicated on a
     sketch. The crime scene photograph log records the photograph, describes the type of
     photograph, precise photograph location, and the identifying data is recorded as each shot is
     taken.
AFI31-206 16 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 23


      2.29.2.1. One of the most important elements in investigative photography is maintaining
      perspective. Photographs must reproduce with the same impression of relative position
      and size of visible objects (the scene as it would appear to someone standing in the
      photographer’s shoes). Any significant distortion in perspective will reduce, or destroy
      altogether, the evidentiary value of the photography.
      2.29.2.2. Photograph evidence before recovery.
         2.29.2.2.1. Ensure that a progression of overall, medium, and close-up photographs
         of any objects of evidence are taken.
      2.29.2.3. Photograph the interior crime scene using a series of overlapping 360°
      photographs and a wide-angle lens.
      2.29.2.4. Photograph the exterior crime scene establishing the location of the scene by a
      series of overall photographs including landmarks. Photographs should have a 360°
      coverage.
         2.29.2.4.1. Consider aerial photography to capture large areas, roads, and other
         means of approach or departure. Coordinate with the laboratory on proper aerial-
         photography techniques.
      2.29.2.5. All evidence should be photographed three times. An evidence establishing
      photograph should be taken to show the evidence and its position in relation to other
      evidence, and a close-up photograph that fills the frame should be taken with and without
      a ruler.

XXXXXX Squadron/XXXXX. CI believes there is drug activity within the unit, because he
hears talk of marijuana use around the smoke break area. CI has a personality in which he talks
to lots of people he works with. As such, he has access to all offices in his work place. CI grew
up in an area where marijuana was very prevalent and understands the current street language.
