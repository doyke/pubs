1. Objectives.
     1.1. Enable work center supervisors to identify and correct oversights.
     1.2. Enable commanders to identify management problems within their organization.
     1.3. Implement and track status of corrective actions.
     1.4. Elevate problems as necessary to resolve them.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The 56 FW Inspector General (IG) has overall responsibility for the program.
     2.2. Group commanders will establish their own self-inspection program.
     2.3. Group commanders will appoint a responsible officer, SNCO or Civilian equivalent to
     be the group self-inspection monitors. Group self-inspection monitor appointment letters
     will be forwarded to 56 FW/IGI. Group self-inspection monitors will conduct and document
     periodic spot checks of self-inspection programs of units within their respective group.
     Commanders will appoint self-inspection monitors for their respective unit and forward their
     appointment letter to the group self-inspection monitors. 56 FW Staff Agency Chiefs will
     forward their appointment letters directly to 56 FW/IGI. Management Internal Control
     Toolset (MICT) generated self-inspection appointment letters will be used and may be
     forwarded to the Group or 56 FW/IGI electronically. All self-inspection monitors are
     responsible for implementing and managing a functional self-inspection program. 56
     FW/IGI will provide self-inspection monitor or MICT training on request.
     2.4. Unit commanders or staff agency chiefs not assigned to a group are responsible for
     establishing and managing a self-inspection program. Adequate written procedures, if
     required, may be developed by each organization to allow for a viable self-inspection
     program.
3. Procedures.
     3.1. Self-Inspection Book. A loose-leaf binder shall be maintained in each organizational
     unit (or work center functional area, if unit size or complexity merits more functional areas
     than one) to hold checklists, discrepancy work sheets, and relevant source material pertaining
     to that area. Flight-sized work centers may elect to maintain their self-inspection materials in
     a designated area of their continuity binder. Items will be accomplished through MICT;
     paper copies will be printed from the exported PDF copy of completed checklists and filed in
     the appropriate section of the binder. At a minimum, each binder will contain the following:
        3.1.1. Commander’s MICT generated letter of appointment, designating primary and
        alternate self-inspection monitors.
        3.1.2. All applicable self-inspection checklists.
        3.1.3. Copies of the last two (at a minimum) self-inspection checklists completed.
        3.1.4. Open discrepancies.
        3.1.5. Closed discrepancies.
        3.1.6. Documented periodic spot checks.
        3.1.7. Other reports and cross feed information.
LUKEAFBI90-201 13 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              3


     3.1.8. Additional items as deemed appropriate by the group commander or agency chief.
  3.2. At a minimum, self-inspections will be conducted semiannually in July and January.
  The inclusive periods will be 1 January through 30 June and 1 July through 31 December.
  Group commanders may stagger inspections throughout the inspection period in order to
  accommodate large numbers of work centers. Forward these reports according to paragraph
  3.7., paragraph 3.8., and Table 3.1.
  3.3. Inspections will be in-depth, using all applicable AETC Inspection Guides, Special
  Interest Items, Staff Assistance Visit Reports, etc.
     3.3.1. Attachment 2, Table A1.1 and Table A1.2 contains the list of recommended
     checklists and their descriptions. When determining what checklist to assign, units will
     select, in order of precedence, the AETC, AFIA, or HAF checklist.
     3.3.2. Functional Area Managers (FAM), Program Managers (PM), FW, or group self-
     inspection monitors will review the checklists and determine what items will be
     accomplished at the wing, group, squadron, and flight level. FAMs/PMs will work with
     56 FW/IGI to resolve any questions of checklist validity, completeness, or currency.
     FAM’s/PM's, FW, group, and unit monitors will supplement checklists as required to
     cover local supplements to AFIs or local OIs.
     3.3.3. Each checklist item will include comments describing how each item is
     accomplished, where the supporting data is located, the timeframe for when it is
     accomplished, or other details as appropriate. Comments will be placed in the
     “Comments” block of the applicable inspection line item.
        3.3.3.1. For “Yes/Comply” responses, describe how the unit accomplished the
        described task.
            3.3.3.1.1. For example, the “Yes/Comply” item, “Attend exercise planning
            conferences, as required” could include the comments, “Weekly planning
            meetings are held with core EET staff beginning 60 days prior to an exercise.
            Sign in sheets are filed with the exercise report and are also scanned and stored on
            the ERM drive at \\luke\dfs\ERM\IGI\files folder.”
        3.3.3.2. For “No/Non-Comply” responses, describe why the unit is not in
        compliance, what the corrective action will be, and the estimated completion date.
        Non-compliant items will be answered with the AF eight-step problem solving model
        as outlined in the AFSO21 Playbook and required by AFI 90-201 AETCSUP Para
        2.6.3.7
            3.3.3.2.1. For example, the “No/Non-Comply” item, “Are the two most recent
            completed checklists kept on file?” could include the comments, “During a recent
            SAV after personnel changeover we discovered that previous self-inspections
            were not kept on file. We have placed an MFR in the Self-Inspection Binder and
            provided training to all squadron members on correct records management. The
            discrepancy will be closed 31 July 2011 after two self-inspection cycles have been
            completed and two records are on file.”

             3.3.3.3. For “N/A Not Applicable” responses, describe why the item does not apply.
                3.3.3.3.1. For example, the “N/A Not Applicable” item, “Does the HARM office
                maintain a log to account for each AO number published?” could include the
                comments, “IAW FAM directions this item is accomplished at the Wing level and
                does not apply to the Squadron 1COs.”
     3.4. Additional checklists may be used, tailored to meet the work centers’ particular needs
     and requirements. They should be updated regularly to ensure accuracy.
     3.5. Open items will be followed-up every 90 days in a format that is convenient to each
     individual organization and group commander.
     3.6. As applicable, all squadron-level self-inspection reports will be reviewed by each
     squadron commander or staff agency chief. After review, reports will be sent to their
     respective group self-inspection monitors. Group monitors will consolidate the reports and
     have their group commander review and coordinate. The consolidated reports will cover
     major deficiencies and planned recovery actions.
     3.7. Group commanders will forward a self-inspection completion letter to the 56 FW/IGI
     IAW Table 3.1.

Table 3.1. Self-Inspection Completion Dates.

     If Inspection Period is:        Completion letters are due to 56 FW/IGI NLT:
     1 January - 30 June             31 July
     1 July - 31 December            31 January
     3.8. All wing staff agencies will establish their own self-inspection programs according to
     this guidance and submit reports directly to 56 FW/IGI.
NOTE: The above procedures do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the self-
inspection program. Each unit will manage their own program according to their respective
mission using the procedures outlined above. The objective is to identify deficiencies, which
preclude attainment of required standards.
