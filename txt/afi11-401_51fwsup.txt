This supplement implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 11-401,
Aviation Management, 7 March 2007/Incorporating Change (IC) 1, 13 August 2007/IC 2, 18 May
2009: This instruction establishes policies for requesting and conducting orientation flights in 36th
Fighter Squadron (36 FS) aircraft as well as orientation rides in the A-10 or F-16 simulators. This
instruction applies to all 51 FW flying, maintenance, and support units. The conduct of orientation
flights will comply with AFI 11-401 as supplemented.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes include
reductions to incentive allocations, clarification for periods when personnel or aircraft are ―chopped‖ for
ADCON or OPCON, added a requirement for orientation approval records to be maintained by the 36
FS for one year, added the requirement for commanders to review every orientation candidate’s weight,
and numbered paragraphs to align to new basic publication.
1.9.4.7.1.3.1. (Added) Twenty incentive flights are allotted per fiscal year for annual award winners (4
per group, 4 for 51 FW staff). These allotments are filled by the group commanders and the vice wing
commander. In addition, the Maintenance Professional of the Year (MPOY) winners who have not
previously flown an F-16 at Osan are allotted an incentive slot. A written request IAW Attachment 6 is
required from the award winner’s group commander.
1.9.4.7.1.3.2. (Added) Additional incentive flight requests as well as quarterly award winners or
superior performers may be considered for an incentive ride in an A-10 or F-16 simulator, a ride in a U-
2 chase car, a business effort tanker, and/or guided tour of an A-10, F-16, UH-60, or U-2.
1.9.4.7.1.3.3. (Added) When deployed, the 36 FS may conduct incentive flights but must ensure
compliance with additional host nation, base, and organization regulations.

1.9.4.7.1.3.3.1. (Added) The DETCO may submit incentive flight requests for multiple personnel on
one memorandum, NLT 10 days prior to departure. The memorandum must be approved by the 51
OG/CC and 51 FW/CC and is valid only for the specified deployment.
1.9.4.7.1.3.3.2. (Added) Orientation flights for non-51 FW personnel must have the approval of their
individual group commander (or equivalent) for line of duty considerations before consideration by 51
FW/CC. The flight approval process is the same as for 51 FW personnel.
1.9.4.7.1.3.3.3. (Added) If the 36 FS has been ―chopped‖ for Operational Control (OPCON), then the
approval authority for the flight is the owning wing commander or equivalent. 51 OG/CC and
51 FW/CC will be included in the orientation approval chain prior to the owning WG/CC.
1.9.4.7.1.3.3.4. (Added) Each person receiving an orientation flight must have approval from their
group-level commander for line of duty considerations. If the individual has been ―chopped‖ for
Administrative Control (ADCON), this is the owning group-level commander.
1.9.4.7.1.6. (Added) Requesting Orientation Flights.
1.9.4.7.1.6.1. (Added) Submissions must be staffed on a memorandum to be indorsed by the 51
OSS/OSCT, the 51 OG/CC, and the 51 FW/CC for approval IAW Attachment 6. If no waivers or special
considerations are included submit an AF Form 1768, Staff Summery Sheet, without any memorandum
(one page only). All requests must include the nominee’s rank, full name, organization, duty phone,
unclothed weight, DEROS, and justification on the orientation flight request memorandum or staff
summary sheet (if submitted alone).
1.9.4.7.1.6.1.1. (Added) . Osan AB tenant units, to include 7 AF, may apply for orientation flights but
are not provided an allocation. Each unit’s detachment/group commander or equivalent is authorized to
submit one name per year to compete. 7 AF units should strive to balance their requests proportionately
between the 8 FW (with two F-16 squadrons) and the 51 FW (with one F-16 squadron). The 51 OG/CC
will determine mission impact and feasibility.
1.9.4.7.1.6.1.2. (Added) For nominees within the 51 FW, but outside the 51 OG, the POC must first
attain their group-level commander/vice commander’s signature prior to submitting the memorandum to
51 OSS/OSCT for coordination.
1.9.4.7.1.6.1.3. (Added) For nominees within the 51 OG, squadron commanders will submit a
memorandum directly to 51 OSS/OSCT for coordination.
1.9.4.7.1.6.2. (Added) POCs will review the individuals weight and only submit individuals for
Orientation Flights if their weight falls between 140 lbs and 211 lbs, their buttock to knee measures a
maximum of 27.1 inches and sitting height is a maximum of 39.7 inches. The waiver authority for this
requirement is the 51 FW/CC. Waivers will not normally be considered but if requested must be
submitted as a seperate Tab within the staff summary sheet in Attachment 6.
1.9.4.7.1.6.3. (Added) The 51 OG/CC will review all Orientation Flight requests to determine
eligibility, mission impact, pilot and aircraft availability prior to consideration by 51 FW/CC. A signed
copy of the 51 FW/CC approval letter will be provided to 51 OSS/OSCT for record and to 36 FS/SARM
for go-no-go prior to the individual’s flight.
1.9.4.7.1.7. (Added) Orientation Flight and Orientation Ride Execution.
1.9.4.7.1.7.1. (Added) The primary purpose of an incentive flight is to reward the outstanding
performance of an officially recognized award winner. The 36 FS will schedule approved incentive
flights to be flown on Fridays during daylight hours unless operational training needs dictate otherwise.
AFI11-401_51FWSUP 13 JULY 2009                                                                             3


Simulated emergency procedures will not be flown. Incentive flights will not be scheduled for hot pits or
sorties requiring anti-exposure suits due to stress on the passenger.
1.9.4.7.1.7.2. (Added) The primary purpose of a familiarization flight is to introduce 51 FW personnel
who normally have aviation-related responsibilities to USAF aircraft and combat missions to increase
their ability to contribute to the mission. Familiarization missions will be flown on a non-interference
basis using normal training profiles in conjunction with a scheduled training mission. The mission
flown should correspond to the individual’s area of contribution to the combat mission (a J-TAC should
be flown on a CAS mission primarily, a COBRA Weapons Director on an Air-to-Air mission primarily).
Familiarization flight individuals will participate in the mission planning, flight briefings, and flight
debrief if they possess the security clearance.
1.9.4.7.1.7.3. (Added) Pilot In Command (PIC) procedures for Orientation Flights
1.9.4.7.1.7.3.1. (Added) The PIC of the Orientaton flight aircraft will be, at a minimum, a mission
ready flight lead or experienced wingman or have the explicit approval of the 36 FS/CC. For General
Officer and Distinguished Visitor flights, the pilot must be an instructor pilot.
1.9.4.7.1.7.3.2. (Added) The PIC will ensure the individual has 51 FW/CC approval, medical approval
documented on an AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty,
Egress and Hanging Harness training IAW AFI 11-301, Vol 1, Aircrew Life Support (ALS) Program,
and AFI 16-1301, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, And Escape (Sere) Program, within the past 72 hours,
and will personally brief the individual on stick interference and the proper operation of the oxygen
regulator. The PIC will ensure that any individual flying on a waiver for weight signs a memorandum
for record stating that they are aware of the increased risk of injury in the event of ejection and that they
elect to accept that risk.
1.9.4.7.1.7.3.3. (Added) If tapes and DTC’s are used for orientation flights, their classification level
will not exceed the clearance possessed by the individual receiving the orientation flight.
1.9.4.7.1.8. (Added) Division of Responsibility for the Orientation Program
1.9.4.7.1.8.1. (Added) 51 OSS/OSCT will:

Orientation Flight approval letter Attachment 6 on file for a period of one year.
1.9.4.7.1.8.2.2. (Added) Be prepared to provide 51 OSS/OSCT with a list, within five duty days after
the end of each quarter, of all orientation flights flown.
1.9.4.7.1.8.2.3. (Added) Make every effort to fly approved individuals within one month.
1.9.4.7.1.8.2.4. (Added) Notify each orientation flight participant by letter Attachment 7 of their
scheduled ground training and flight time one week prior to the event to permit time to coordinate with
their supervision for the time away from their workplace.
 4                                                                 AFI11-401_51FWSUP 13 JULY 2009

F-16 Incentive Flight for Rank Firstname Lastname                                  20080101
SUMMARY

1. PURPOSE: Request 51 FW/CC approval for an incentive (or familiarization) flight for Rank Name.

2. DISCUSSION: Request an incentive flight for:
Name                    Rank            Organization Duty Phone                                         DEROS              Weight
Lastname, First         Rank            Org          784-XXXX                                           Jul 09             XXX lbs

XXXXX has consistently distinguished himself as (his job). During his tenure at Osan AB, he has
(place accolades here). For a familiarization flight DO NOT include accolades but instead detail the
individuals aviation-related responsibilities and how the flying mission will benefit from the experience
the individual will gain by flying. If a specific mission is appropriate for a familiarization flight for the
individual, include the type of mission desired for training (CAS, OPSAT, BFM, etc).My POC for this
request is XXXXX.

3. RECOMMENDATION: 51 FW/CC review and approve request.

FROM: (Group CC or Higher)

SUBJECT: Incentive Flight Request With Accomaning Waiver For Weight Out of Limits

1. Request an incentive flight for the following individual:

Rank Name                     Organization           Duty Phone     DEROS           Weight
SSgt Lastname, First          51 SQ/OFFICE           784-XXXX       3 Jan 09        XXX

2. This memo should only be completed if there will be a weight waiver attached or if there are
special circumstances (multiple individuals, deployment incentive requests, foreign national
involvement, irregular profiles). Include a strong justification for an orientation ride to include
annual award winners or equivalent for incentive rides. For familiarization flights please replace
all references to ―incentive‖ in the above SSS and this memorandum with ―familiarization.‖ The
separate weight waiver memo (if required) only needs the wing commander’s signature block
and should reference AFI 48-123, VOL 3 paragraph A5.10.1.4.

3. My POC for this program is Capt Group Exec, 51 GP/CCE, 784-XXXX.

           Surgeon General NOTAM
        RISK MANAGEMENT LESSONS
                                        October 23, 2006


The following Notice to Airman (NOTAM) is released by the Air Force Medical Operations Agency
(SGPA) and The Office of the Surgeon General.


                       ATTENTION:
         THE FOLLOWING IS AN OFFICIAL SG NOTAM
       PLEASE PRINT, READ, AND DISSEMINATE TO ALL
                  PERSONNEL ASSIGNED.
TARGET AUDIENCE: This NOTAM should be reviewed by all Flight Medicine and Human
Performance Training Team (HPTT) staff


              06-01. Incentive/Orientation Flight Medical Clearance
This NOTAM should be reviewed by all Flight Medicine and HPTT staff who perform incentive
or orientation pre-flight medical clearance.

Recently, a fighter incentive flight for an active duty member resulted in suffocation after the
incentive rider inadvertently placed the oxygen regulator (CRU-93) in the ―off‖ position and then
was unable to analyze the situation, return the regulator to the ―on‖ position or drop his oxygen
mask. Training and proficiency issues were cited in the mishap investigation as causal factors in
this unfortunate event.

AFI 48-123, V3, Medical Examinations And Standards Volume 3-Flying And Special
Operational Duty, Attachment 5 establishes the medical requirements for incentive/orientation
flights in USAF ejection seat aircraft. It does not however, establish essential elements of the
history and physical exam or information that must be briefed to the potential flyer before
medical clearance is issued via AF Form 1042. The required minimum includes:

   1. A comprehensive past medical history screening form to identify any conditions that may
      predispose the incentive rider to medical difficulties inflight from hypoxia, barotrauma or
      exposure to G forces.
   2. A targeted physical exam to include visualization of satisfactory Valsalva maneuver and
 12                                                                AFI11-401_51FWSUP 13 JULY 2009


         auscultation of the heart and lungs. Further physical exam to characterize and resolve
         any items identified in the historical screening form.
      3. Anthropometric measurements must be assessed and applied to the unique airframe IAW
         AFI 48-123, V3, paragraph A5.10.1.3.. Individuals selected for flight who do not meet
         standards will be dispositioned IAW AFI 48-123, V3, paragraph A5.10.1.4.

      4. A brief discussion of the unique environment of flight to include: acceleration and G
         forces; vertigo and airsickness; effects of altitude on pressure and oxygen tension; and the
         cockpit pressurization and oxygen delivery systems.

The foregoing list is not all-inclusive but should serve as a guide. Standardized forms or
overprints may be developed and used while deployed/TDY. Education may be individualized or
accomplished in a group setting by Flight Surgeons or Aerospace Physiologists. This clearance is
valid for no more than 14 days IAW AFI 48-123, V3, paragraph A5.10., and should be re-
accomplished if the flight is delayed. The hands-on training with Life Support personnel in a
Part Task Trainer (cockpit mock-up) will serve to reinforce the education portion of the medical
clearance and demonstrate proficiency with the actual systems used inflight. This enhanced
awareness of incentive/orientation flight medical clearance must be part of a team approach with
Life Support and flying personnel to maximize safe flying operations.
