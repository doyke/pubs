It implements AFPD 36-8, Employee Benefits and Entitlements. This instruction establishes procedures
for flexible work schedules for civilian employees. It applies to all USAFK appropriated and non-appro-
priated fund US and Korean National (KN) employees. All decisions concerning work scheduling, arrival
and departure times, lunch breaks, and credit hour usage must be coordinated with and approved by the
employee’s supervisor.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision converts previous regulation to new instruction format and makes minor changes in some of
the definitions. A “|” indicates revised material since the last edition.

1. Definitions:
   1.1. Flexitime. A system of work scheduling which splits the work day into two different types of
   time: core time and flexible time.
   1.2. Core time. That portion of the day during which all employees must be present for work.
   1.3. Flexible time. That portion of the work day during which the employee has the option to select
   and/or vary starting and quitting times within limits established by the organization. Additionally, it
   may include a flexible period between 1100 to 1300 for an employee to select a varying and/or
   extended lunch break.
   1.4. Working Hours. Those time periods of the day during which each employee will complete the
   designated number of hours for his or her workday.
   1.5. Credit Hours (US appropriated fund civilians only). Hours which are in excess of the basic eight
   hour day. Credit hours are distinguished from overtime hours in that they are not officially ordered in
   advance by management. Unless limited by organization policy or the supervisor, there is no restric-
   tion on the number of credit hours an employee may earn during a biweekly pay period. However, the
   employee may not carry forward more than 24 credit hours from one pay period to the next. The num-
2                                                                    7AFI36-801 16 DECEMBER 1996


    ber of credit hours worked daily or weekly may be limited by the organization or supervisor. Credit
    hours earned do not increase an entitlement to overtime.

2. Policy. The use of flexitime in an organization is at the discretion of the commander and supervisors;
once adopted, flexitime schedules may be discontinued by the commander and/or supervisor if the mis-
sion demands it. Under the concept of flexitime, fixed times of arrival and departure are replaced by core
time and flexible time. Flexible time for beginning the workday is established between 0600 and 0900;
the flexible time ending the workday is between 1500 and 1800. Core time is the period between 0900 and
1500. The latest time an employee may begin work is 0900 and the earliest time that an employee may
leave work is 1500. Each employee must work a minimum block of 8 hours and 30 minutes, including a
mandatory midday 30 minute lunch break, between the hours of 0600 and 1800. Employees may take
from 30 minutes to two hours for lunch between 1100 and 1300. The following are examples of varying
degrees of flexibility which are possible within the basic work day.
    2.1. Flexitour. The employee selects arrival and departure times within a flexible band; however, once
    selected, the hours become the employee’s regular work schedule until another selection is made. This
    could be as frequently or infrequently as desired or allowed by the supervisor or organization.
    2.2. Modified flexitours. Similar to Flexitour, the employee selects a starting time, but is given a
    degree of flexibility on either side of the selected arrival time which may be 5, 10 or 15 minutes. If an
    employee selects 0730 as a starting time and is given a 15 minute variation, then the employee could
    report for work anywhere from 0715 to 0745. However, it is understood that the basic schedule is
    0730 or other selected starting time and, under normal circumstances, the employee is expected to
    adhere to the schedule. The employee may occasionally deviate from this schedule for emergencies,
    medical appointments or other unforeseen circumstances.
    2.3. Modified gliding schedule. A combination of flexitour and modified flexitour. The supervisor/
    organization identifies a flexible time band, core time band and also establishes an eight hour cus-
    tomer service band. This schedule is normally used where coverage for a certain period of the day is
    required. A certain percentage of the employees would be placed on a flexitour or modified flexitour,
    selecting a starting time which would maintain coverage for the customer service hours.
    2.4. Gliding schedule. Employees may select an arrival time each day and may change that arrival
    time without prior notification to the supervisor so long as it is within the established flexible time
    band.
    2.5. Organizations and work units may or may not elect to establish flexible and core time bands to
    meet their needs. All offices must be sufficiently staffed to ensure business can be transacted, services
    rendered, and employees are adequately supervised. This may at times require employee(s) to forfeit
    their option to use flexitime.

3. Notice Requirements:
    3.1. Supervisors must give KN employees three days advance notice and US employees seven days
    advance notice before changing to/from flexitime schedules.
    3.2. Under flexitime, supervisors may change US and KN employee schedules at anytime with one
    day prior notification.

4. Procedures:
   4.1. Each employee signs his or her name on 7 AF Form 4, Daily Sign-In/Sign-Out Record (Attach-
   ment 1). Employees enter the time of arrival and departure (Attachment 2), and category of leave
   taken, if applicable.
   At the end of each day the employee enters the total number of hours worked, accounts for any leave
   taken, and initials in the applicable block. Record sign in/out time in five minute increments. Signing
   or making entries for another employee is strictly prohibited.
   4.2. Organizations retain the sign in/out record for a period of three years. The Civilian Payroll Office
   audits these sheets periodically. Instances of abuse, including failure to sign in/out or errors in compu-
   tation, are resolved by the employee’s supervisor and may result in the loss of flexitime privileges
   and/or disciplinary action. At the discretion of the supervisor, letters or warning may be issued to the
   employee. Supervisors must inform employees of any errors and other discrepancies found on the 7
   AF Form 4, Daily Sign-In/Sign-Out Record.

5. Forms Prescribed: 7 AF Form 4 (EF), Daily sign-In/Sign-Out Record.

**Midday Flex Times include time agencies allow employees for lunch.
To find the time an employee’s workday ends, find the time he/she began the workday along the left-hand column of the grid; then along the
top of the grid find the amount of time he/she spent in the midday flex band (for lunch and/or personal time). The point at which the Workday
Starting Time row intersects the Midday Flex column is the Ending Time for an 8-hour day. For example: Gene Gliding arrives at his desk to
commence his workday at 6:05 a.m. At 11:30 a.m., he goes out to lunch and to run an errand and comes back at 12:35 p.m. (1 hour and 5
minutes later). Thus, his 8-hour workday ends at 3:10 p.m. (the time at the point of the 6:05 Starting Time row and the 1 hr, 05 Midday Flex
Time column).
