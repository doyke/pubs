                                            Chapter 1

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Policies.
     1.1.1. The 49 FW/XP is the OPR for local exercises and evaluations conducted under the
     authority of AFI 90-201, ACC Supplement, IG Activities, AFI 10-2501, AF Emergency
     Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, and AFI 10-2603, Emergency Health
     Powers on Air Force Installations. All units specifically tasked under approved scenarios
     will participate unless exempted by 49th Fighter Wing Commander (49 FW/CC) or
     designated authority.
     1.1.2. All EET members are trusted agents and will have access to privileged information
     regarding exercise planning. This information includes, but is not limited to, exercise start
     (STARTEX) times, scenarios, specific areas for evaluation, exercise end (ENDEX) times,
     etc. Divulging such information adversely affects exercise objectives and will result in
     removal from the EET and possible disciplinary action.
     1.1.3. In addition to major exercises, EET may be used to conduct functional inspections of
     particular areas or as directed by 49 FW/CC. For example, an evaluation of mobility folders
     for a given unit may be conducted outside of a mobility exercise.
     1.1.4. Exercise policies should focus on competency of and compliance with the
     requirements listed in Holloman AFB CEMP 10-2, Holloman AFB 10-403, Installation
     Deployment Plan, Holloman AFB 10-404, In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plan (IGESP), the
     49 FW Anti-Terrorism Plan, and 49th Medical Group (49 MDG) Medical Contingency
     Response Plan (MCRP). Exercises must evaluate and reinforce the capabilities to meet
     those requirements. Readiness and disaster exercise requirements are listed in Chapter 3.
     1.1.5. Due to the unique missions of the 29th Attack Squadron (29 ATKS), 16th Training
     Squadron (16 TS), 6th Reconnaissance Squadron (6 RS), and the 849th Aircraft Maintenance
     Squadron (849 AMXS), EET activities will be limited to emergency and major accident
     response in order to reduce impact to training syllabus.
     1.1.6. Administration Support. The wing, through the 49th Force Support Squadron
     Manpower and Organization section (49 FSS/FSMM), will task each group to provide
     personnel to support administrative functions of the IG work center as needed.
     Administrative support personnel will report to the IG work center and be supervised by 49
     FW/XP personnel. Administrative support personnel are exempt from the Resource
     Augmentation Duty (READY) program.
1.2. Objectives. The installation’s EET Program is structured to meet three objectives:
     1.2.1. Provide Installation Commander a means to plan and conduct realistic, integrated
     exercises, and training for all installation personnel.
     1.2.2. Maximize the benefits gained through exercises and provide accurate, honest feedback
     to commanders for planning, preparation, and training purposes. Specifically, the exercise
     program and evaluator training strive to enhance readiness, boost capabilities, streamline
     procedures, and improve mission readiness.

        Initial Response, e.g. C2, Deployment Processing (personnel/cargo), Employment
        Readiness (aircraft gen/regen), Info Operations and Force Protection.
        1.4.1.2. Each event will usually range from 12 hours to 5 days depending on scope. It
        may begin with execution of the wing’s recall plan, proceed to Initial Response activities,
HOLLOMANAFBI90-201 10 FEBRUARY 2010                                                             9


     and possibly include beddown of incoming forces in some cases. This includes effective
     Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS) C2 operations from Unit Control
     Centers (UCCs) up to the Crisis Action Team (CAT) also known as Installation Control
     Center (ICC).
  1.4.2. Phase II ORE.
     1.4.2.1. These exercises evaluate a unit’s ability to perform wartime or contingency
     missions and consist of Employment, Mission Support, and Ability To Survive and
     Operate (ATSO). Phase II Operational Readiness Inspections (ORIs) are similar to
     typical Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF) taskings for some units; however, a Phase
     II ORI will be much more robust for most units in order to completely assess the
     organization’s ability to fight today’s war as well as the wars of the future.
     1.4.2.2. These exercises are conducted over a period of several days and incorporate
     attack-response exercises along with primary flying mission operations. Exercise
     objectives are based on the planning assumptions as illustrated in applicable OPLANs,
     operations orders, and directives. Robust TBMCS C2 operations are required.
  1.4.3. MAREs/Natural Disaster Exercises. These exercises are developed from the
  planning assumptions as identified in wing’s CEMP 10-2 and IAW this instruction. These
  exercises are designed to meet the following objectives with minimum simulation:
     1.4.3.1. Accident scenarios simulate the types of aircraft, cargo, vehicles, munitions, and
     hazardous commodities operated, handled, or otherwise processed by Holloman AFB
     personnel.
     1.4.3.2. Off-base scenarios IAW local emergency response agencies.
  1.4.4. Terrorist Use of CBRNE/Anti-Terrorism Exercise (ATX). The base Anti-
  Terrorism Officer (ATO) must work with EET Team Chief, Anti-Terror Working Group
  (ATWG) members, AF Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI), and medical agencies to
  develop plausible exercise scenarios based on the threat IAW AFI 10-245, para 2.9.3.8
  These exercises will also be included in the wing’s annual schedule.
  1.4.5. Public Health and Disease Outbreak Exercises. These exercises involve large scale
  Public health emergencies and disease outbreaks (whether naturally occurring or as a result
  of a biological attack) and can appear and spread rapidly, leading to widespread health,
  social, and economic consequences. These include personnel quarantine/isolation, facility
  decontamination, etc. Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) scenarios may be considered in
  this category. Requires close coordination with Public Health Emergency Officer (PHEO)
  and the Installation ATO.
  1.4.6. Special Interest Item (SII) Program. The Air Force-level SIIs provide a means to
  focus management attention, gather data, and/ or evaluate the status of specific programs and
  conditions in the field. SIIs also provide feedback from the field that functional staffs use to
  enhance decision-making and policy adjustments. Active Air Force-level SIIs should not
  exceed more than five at any given time. Wing/unit personnel: Obtain SII information via
  MAJCOM IG or SAF/IGI at SAF/IGI - Inspector General, Inspections Directorate.
  Wings/units not inspected during the active period of this SII will conduct a one-time self-
  inspection and report results to their MAJCOM IG for their fourth quarterfinal report.

  1.4.7. The following conditions may also be exercised during exercise scenarios:
     Aircraft Decontamination                      Contamination Control
     Aircrew Extraction                            Information Operations

  1.4.8. Other wing exercises may be directed to test other objectives, such as civil support
  requirements.
  1.4.9. Squadron Readiness Exercises (SRE) may be conducted for areas requested by
  squadron commanders. 49 FW/XP may provide an informal evaluation to the group and
  squadron commanders if requested.
HOLLOMANAFBI90-201 10 FEBRUARY 2010                                                              11

                                EET PROGRAM STRUCTURE

2.1. General. The 49 FW/XP Chief is the focal point for the overall wing exercise program.
Each group, staff agency and associate unit will designate EET group representatives (primary
and alternate), functional area chiefs, and team members to ensure each area is properly assessed
to meet evaluation program objectives. While performing evaluations, the group representatives
oversee and provide direction to functional area chiefs and team members. They also conduct
post-exercise reviews, write reports, and report directly to the 49 FW/XP Chief.
2.2. Basic Structure. The following indicates all the key elements and functional areas within
each group that make up the wing’s EET team. The composition and size of the team will vary
depending on the type of exercise, participants, location, etc. Minimum EET member
requirements are listed in referenced tables IAW paragraph 2.3

Figure 2.1. EET Organizational Structure




2.3. EET Member Requirements – By Functional Area. Each area may have more members
qualified/trained and available as EET members. For example, six personnel may be trained as
EET members, but only two will perform EET duties for a particular exercise, leaving the
remaining four available to participate in the exercise. This gives the unit the flexibility to have

                                   EET MANAGEMENT

3.1. General. The complexity of a major exercise requires a clearly organized exercise program
led by and executed by a well trained and skilled EET. Unit commanders and senior leaders
must select and appoint the candidates who are most experienced and understand the function
and management of each unit’s mission.
3.2. Training Requirements.
   3.2.1. Prior to evaluating installation activities, EET members will complete the core
   training outlined in Table 3-2. Additional training may be required when directed by the
   EET Chief or to enable EET members to meet specialized team, functional area, host-nation,
   or local requirements or standards.
   3.2.2. All Referenced ―ONLINE‖ training courses are available in the AF Portal, Advanced
   Distributed Learning Service (ADLS), under the EM course list. The following Tables

                                   EXERCISE PLANNING

4.1. Exercise Schedule:
    4.1.1. The 49 FW/XP Team Chief compiles, coordinates, schedules, and obtains approval for
    the wing’s calendar year exercise schedule. To the largest extent, the schedule includes all
    requirements listed in Table 4-1, depending on priorities and calendar events. For efficiency,
    exercises may be combined into one, so long as activities are not included in same scenario.
    4.1.2. The Wing’s senior leadership will determine exercise timeline, objectives, and scope.
    4.1.3. The 49 FW/XP will publish the schedule at least annually and as often as changes
    occur.
    4.1.4. In-house exercises that groups/associate units conduct that may affect the overall
    exercise schedule must be coordinated with 49 FW/XP prior to execution.
    4.1.5. The installation Antiterrorism Officer (ATO) will work with 49 FW/XP Chief,
    AFOSI, and base agencies to develop plausible anti-terrorism exercise scenarios based on the
    threat IAW AFI 10-245. These exercises will also be included in the wing’s annual schedule.

     Note 1–MAJCOMs will determine types, scenarios and scope of exercises for their installations
     in their MAJCOM supplements to this instruction.
     Note 2–Installations will determine if outside exercises such as the AF All Hazards Response
     Training, Department of Homeland Security or other multi-jurisdictional agency exercises count
     as part of their exercise requirements.
     Note 3–MAJCOMs will provide specifics for their installations for exercise frequency and
     types.
     Note 4–An exercise (major accident, natural disaster, terrorist use of CBRNE or an ORE) must
     be conducted at least quarterly. Installations can combine types of exercises to limit the total
     number of exercises per year.
     Note 5–COCOM/CC can modify these requirements to meet their specific area/theater needs.
     Note 6–Types can be combined in the same exercise period and in the same scenario.
     Note 7. Off-base Response, Mass Casualty, HAZMAT Team, CBRNE Incident, and Public
     Health and disease outbreak exercises may be conducted simultaneously.

4.2. Exercise Cycle Planning Procedures. The 49 FW/XP Chief will conduct EET planning
sessions on a weekly basis and advance planning using the following process:
    4.2.1. Step 1. Conduct needs assessment. Determine/finalize exercise objectives through
    commanders and EET member inputs, applicable OPLAN and contingency plan procedures,
    previous exercise reports; command SIIs, and IG exercise findings from other bases.
    4.2.2. Step 2. Determine the following:
       4.2.2.1. If natural disaster or major accident, determine type of emergency or activity
       (Tornado, flood, etc.). For ORE exercises, determine focused areas, such as cargo
       processing, aircraft generation, mobility process, etc.
       4.2.2.2. Location (Where and who will be affected?)
       4.2.2.3. Functions (What functional areas/processes will be evaluated?).
            4.2.2.4. Participants.
    4.2.3. Step 3. Develop exercise objectives consistent with specific activities/focused areas
    using SMART guidelines:
            4.2.3.1. Specific
       4.2.3.2. Measurable
       4.2.3.3. Achievable
            4.2.3.4. Realistic
 20                                          HOLLOMANAFBI90-201 10 FEBRUARY 2010


       4.2.3.5. Task-Oriented.
   4.2.4. Step 4. Prepare narrative (Situation leading to STARTEX)
   4.2.5. Step 5. Identify major and detailed events and develop:
       4.2.5.1. Scenario
       4.2.5.2. Exercise input messages
       4.2.5.3. Master Scenario Events List (MSEL), include validating simulations
       4.2.5.4. Player Instructions
   4.2.6. Step 6. Establish actions. Formalize Explosives Safety Plan if needed and submit
   augmentee personnel request, as required. Obtain unexploded ordnance (UXO) simulated
   assets from EOD as required.
   4.2.7. Step 7. Final preparations.     Develop Control Staff Instructions. (HHQ messages,
   directives, etc.)
4.3. Augmentee Support. Personnel needed to augment EET or form moulage teams will be
requested by FW/XP to FSS/FSMM via base detail request. During mass casualty exercises each
group will also be tasked to provide augmentees. The group representatives will coordinate
requests for additional exercise props in sufficient time to be available for the exercise.
Administrative Support personnel will report to the IG work center (building 296) and be
supervised by XP personnel.
4.4. Exercise Simulations. Local simulations are considered non-standard simulations and
require FW/CC approval. Simulations should be kept to an absolute minimum.
   4.4.1. Group Commanders will review and submit simulations requests to 49 FW/XP NLT
   one week prior to exercise start time IAW Attachment 3.
   4.4.2. Commanders must make every effort to eliminate shortfalls or restrictions in order to
   ensure unit readiness and the unit’s ability to execute real-world peacetime/contingency
   plans.
   4.4.3. Approval Process. The 49 FW/XP Chief will notify the group by email when a
   simulation is disapproved or provide a hard copy memorandum with a locally assigned
   control number if the simulation is approved. Only MAJCOM and 49 FW-approved
   simulations listed in the 49 FW Plans and Inspections CoP will be used.
   4.4.4. Refer to appropriate AFI 90-201 supplement for additional guidance on simulation
   process prior to IG inspections.

                               CONDUCTING AN EXERCISE

5.1. Trusted Agent Clause. EET members/special agents who possess details or information
on an upcoming exercise are considered "trusted agents." Supervisors and commanders must
refrain from requesting information pertaining to exercise timelines, scenarios, etc., for the
purposes of anticipating events to game ratings or obtain predictable results. Disclosing exercise
details outside EET channels will undermine the evaluation process and produce false unit
capabilities. Commanders at all levels must ensure the integrity of the trusted agent system.
5.2. Pre-Exercise Actions:
   5.2.1. Group representatives will identify EET members by functional area, name, and shift.
   The list will be provided to XP one week prior to the exercise to facilitate radio call sign

                                           Chapter 6

                                 ANALYSIS AND REPORT

6.1. Exercise Evaluation: Evaluators will document and collect exercise details and
observations immediately from STARTEX to facilitate report writing and classifying
observations (e.g. deficiencies, strengths, etc.). Group representatives are at the core of this
process. They obtain inputs from EET member during the course of the exercise and collectively
determine and classify observations as follows:
   6.1.1. Findings. By definition, a finding is normally a Critical, Significant (Major), or
   Minor deficiency. These are usually associated with non-compliance with tech data,
   OPLAN, manuals, timelines, etc., of policy or technical nature. It corresponds to a unit’s
   inability to comply with published guidance.
   6.1.2. Recommended Improvement Areas (RIAs). RIAs are not findings, instead they are
   an identified process, product, or capability which could be improved by a suggested course
   of action. RIAs are included in exercise reports under ―Areas for Improvement‖ without a
   deficiency number assigned.
   6.1.3. Strengths. Strengths are programs, processes, products, or teams that clearly exceed
   minimum standards or are key to a unit’s success.
6.2. Hot-Wash. At the Wing Commander's discretion, immediately after ENDEX, an exercise
hot wash may be conducted to provide immediate feedback to commanders. The hot wash will
be a broad overview of the exercise scenario, lessons learned, and observations without including
specific findings. If conducted, participants include squadron/group commanders, group
representatives, area chiefs, staff agency chiefs, and key personnel from evaluated areas.
6.3. Validation Process. Group representatives will meet with evaluators and/or exercise
players as soon as practical and discuss observations/findings and validate each accordingly.
   6.3.1. Findings will be validated at ENDEX with individual unit commanders. Units will be
   given an opportunity to clarify/rebut observations and conclusions to avoid
   misunderstandings and improve accuracy.
   6.3.2. Disagreements that cannot be resolved during the validation process will be elevated
   to the Team Chief for further consideration. Note that an area for improvement or
   observation is not final until the report is published.
6.4. Report Writing:
   6.4.1. The Team Chief is the OPR for producing the report NLT 15 days from ENDEX.
   6.4.2. Each Group Representative will input their portion in the provided exercise report
   shell as validated data becomes available, but NLT 48 hours after ENDEX. Each objective
   must be properly evaluated and rated accordingly. During exercises, the Administrative
   Support personnel may assist group representatives with this task.
   6.4.3. The report will provide specific reporting and closure instructions. The Team Chief
   and respective group representatives will track findings until closure and maintain a record of
   all exercise reports and replies.

6.5. Rating System: All exercises at Holloman, to include disaster preparedness exercises
(MARE, HAZMAT, natural disasters, etc.), will be rated using the IG’s five-tier rating system.
For readiness exercises, EET Members must become familiar with and utilize specific criteria
contained in AFI90-201_ACCSUP1_Addendum-A.
   6.5.1. Outstanding.
   6.5.2. Excellent.
   6.5.3. Satisfactory.
   6.5.4. Marginal.
   6.5.5. Unsatisfactory.
6.6. Remedial Action Program (RAP). The EET Chief will develop deficiency tracking
program and procedures. This program will complement the Air Force RAP per AFI 10-204.
   6.6.1. The 49 FW Plans and Inspections CoP will be the main program for tracking and
   resolving significant problems identified in HHQ inspections, installation exercises, unit self-
   assessment, and real-world operations after-action reports.
   6.6.2. This program documents the problem, establishes accountability for corrections and
   monitors corrective action through implementation and conclusion.
