SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision updates numbering and addition of High Speed Taxi Checks (HSTC).
1. General. This instruction expands upon guidance provided by AFI 21-101, AFI 11-2C-
130V3, C-130 Operations Procedures; Technical Order (TO) 1-1-300, Acceptance/Functional
Check Flights and Maintenance Operational Checks; and TO 1C-130E (H)-6CF-1, Acceptance
and/or Functional Check Flight Procedures USAF Series C-130E/H, AC-130H, EC-130E/H,
HC-130H/N/P, LC-130H, WC-130, HC-130(H)N Aircraft. All unit functions that support the

2. Policy. All 302 AW assigned aircraft are required an FCF when directed by T.O. 1C-130A-6.
Following Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System cleanup a FCF may be accomplished at the
discretion of the Quality Assurance Superintendant. The following instructions will be used to
administer the FCF/OCF program.
     2.1. Maintenance Group (MXG) Quality Assurance (MXQ) Superintendant assigns an FCF
     Program Manager. Quality Assurance maintains a copy of all FCF qualified aircrews as
     designated by the 302d Operations Group (OG) Commander (CC).
     2.2. The Plans, Scheduling and Documentation section will coordinate FCF requirements
     with Quality Assurance and the 731st Airlift Squadron (AS).
     2.3. Quality Assurance will coordinate with the Production Superintendent and the aircraft
     crew chief to ensure that all ground operable systems required during the FCF are
     functionally tested during the preflight inspection.
     2.4. High Speed Taxi Checks (HSTC) may be utilized with MXG/CC and OG/CC
     authorization.
        2.4.1. When a HSTC is utilized in lieu of an FCF all FCF procedures will be followed
        for scheduling, QA review and briefings.
     2.5. When all mission-essential maintenance inspections are completed on the aircraft, the
     Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Information Management Tool (IMT) 781 Mission Flight
     Data Document binder will be hand carried to Quality Assurance for review by the Program
     Manager. The AFTO IMT 781 Mission Flight Data Document binder is normally delivered
     to Quality Assurance No Later than 24 hours prior to scheduled takeoff or ground engine
     runs, whichever occurs first. In the case of a post-major Isochronal Inspection (ISO) FCF,
     the AFTO IMT 781 Mission Flight Data Document binder must arrive no later than 48 hours
     prior to the scheduled FCF take-off time. The Quality Assurance Supervisor or MXG
     Commander may waive the 24/48-hour requirement under extenuating circumstances. In all
     cases, the AFTO IMT 781 Mission Flight Data Document binder will be thoroughly
     reviewed for adequacy of completed maintenance actions prior to release of the aircraft. The
     AFTO IMT 781 Mission Flight Data Document binder must include all maintenance actions
     that caused the FCF to be generated.
     2.6. Quality Assurance will accomplish a 100% Quality Verification Inspection on the
     Preflight Inspection and notify the Maintenance Operation Center when the aircraft is
     released for flight the Plans, Scheduling and Documentation section will coordinate with 731
     Airlift Squadron to establish a takeoff time.
     2.7. The aircrew will schedule a briefing time with Quality Assurance no later than two
     hours prior to scheduled ground engine runs/takeoff time.
     2.8. At the pre-FCF briefing, Quality Assurance will furnish the aircrew with a binder
     containing:
        2.8.1. TO 1C-130E (H)-6CF-1, Acceptance/Functional Check Flight Procedures.
        2.8.2. 302 Airlift Wing Instruction 21-102, Functional Check Flight Instructions.
        2.8.3. Acceptance and/or FCF checklist worksheet.
302AWI21-102 1 DECEMBER 2011                                                                   3


     2.8.4. TO 1-1-300, Acceptance/Functional Check Flights, Maintenance Operational
     Checks.
     2.8.5. Letter designating FCF-qualified aircrew members.
  2.9. The Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Information Management Tool (IMT) 781
  Mission Flight Data Document binder and Weight & Balance Handbook are reviewed and
  presented to the flight crew.
  2.10. After completion of the FCF, Quality Assurance will meet the aircrew and conduct a
  thorough mission debrief. After normal duty hours, Quality Assurance or the flight line
  supervisor will debrief the crew. This procedure is utilized to ensure that all items requiring
  checks are completed and properly debriefed and documented. If any items or systems failed
  the FCF and require an additional FCF to verify aircraft safety or dependability, Maintenance
  Operation Center will coordinate with Quality Assurance and the Plans, Scheduling and
  Documentation section to reschedule the aircraft for another FCF after all maintenance is
  completed.
  2.11. All discrepancies discovered by the FCF crew will be documented on the AFTO IMT
  781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. The crew chief monitors the
  discrepancies on the AFTO IMT 781A, until they are cleared or deferred to the AFTO IMT
  781K, Aerospace Vehicle Inspection, Engine Data, Calendar Inspection and Delayed
  Discrepancy Document. When corrective actions have been taken on discrepancies found
  during the FCF, the forms must be hand carried to Quality Assurance for review. This is to
  ensure proper clearing actions have been taken and the FCF data is entered into the Quality
  Assurance Tracking and Trend Analysis System. The crew chief will then forward the
  aircraft forms to the Plans, Scheduling and Documentation section for records action.
