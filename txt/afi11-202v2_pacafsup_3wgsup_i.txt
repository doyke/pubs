                UNIT STAN/EVAL FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION

3.1. Scope. Units include levels of organization under HHQs required to establish a stan/eval
function for purposes of this instruction. Most units are composed of an Operations Group (OG)
and flying squadrons. Where there is no parent OG, squadrons/detachments will assume duties
listed for OGs, where applicable.
3.2. Operations Group. The conduct of the unit level stan/eval program is directed by the
OG/CC.
   3.2.1. Operations Group Commander Responsibilities. Specific responsibilities of the
   OG/CC that relate to the stan/eval program:
       3.2.1.1. Establish and provide manpower to staff a stan/eval function to perform the
       duties directed by this instruction.
       3.2.1.2. Ensure materials provided for mission planning are accurate and current.
       3.2.1.3. Provide a suitable stan/eval testing area.
       3.2.1.4. Direct evaluations to maintain a quality aircrew force.
       3.2.1.5. Direct supplementary evaluations.
       3.2.1.6. Chair and determine the composition of the SEB.
   3.2.2. Operations Group Stan/Eval Functions. At the Operations Group stan/eval (OGV)
   level, emphasis is on unit standardization. Under direction of the Chief of OGV, flight
   examiners will ensure standardization among squadrons and squadron-assigned flight
   examiners. The OGV will:
       3.2.2.1. Establish procedures for review and quality control of AF Forms 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Qualification, and AF Forms 8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (Multiple
       Aircraft).
          3.2.2.1.1. (Added-3WG) . Review and quality control of AF Forms 8, Certificate of
          Aircrew Qualification, will occur during the initial and annual flight evaluation folder
          (FEF) reviews performed by squadron CCV offices, and by 3 OG/OGV during SAVs
          and when reviewing FEFs for review and certification (R&C) boards.
       3.2.2.2. Establish procedures to maintain and review unit Flight Evaluation Folders
       (FEFs). Document these procedures in unit supplements to this instruction. Maintain unit
       FEFs, if applicable.
       3.2.2.3. Establish procedures for the Aircrew Examination Program according to
       Chapter 6 and Chapter 8 of this instruction. Document Aircrew Examination Program
       in the unit supplement to this instruction.
       3.2.2.4. Establish and maintain a trend program.
          3.2.2.4.1. Scope will include trend analysis of all evaluations.
              3.2.2.4.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Trend analysis will include all flight and EP
14                           AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


        evaluations as well as all requisite and periodic written examinations. Flight
        examiners, IPs, and, unit supervisors may identify trends to OGV for performance
        observed outside of evaluations. Units will define procedures in the unit
        supplement to this instruction for identified trends.
        3.2.2.4.1.2. (Added-3WG) . The trends program is designed to identify areas of
        concern within the 3 OG training and evaluation programs and monitor those
        areas for possible process/program improvements. The primary source of trend
        information is aircrew evaluations, but also includes supervisor observations,
        training review panel (TRP) or stan/eval board (SEB) recommendations, aircrew
        testing, instructor comments, and any special emphasis areas identified by HQ
        PACAF. Areas of concern not constituting a statistical trend may also be tracked
        by OG/OGV if requested by OG/CC.
        3.2.2.4.1.3. (Added-3WG) . Evaluation and Testing Trends. Squadrons will
        use Patriot Excalibur (PEX) ®, to the max extent possible, to track and compile
        evaluation trends. Areas/Sub-areas graded U or Q- can be tracked through PEX’s
        ―Trending Criteria‖ under the ―Reports‖ tab. An area constitutes a trend if it is
        graded to a U or Q- in at least 15% (min sample size of 5) of the evaluations
        administered.      Testing trends will comprise individual aircrew written
        examination questions missed by more than 15% of the examinees (minimum
        sample size of 5).
     3.2.2.4.2. For units with more than one type of aircraft, combine discrepancies
     common to all aircraft/aircrews to determine trends (e.g., instrument procedures).
     3.2.2.4.3. For Formal Training Units (FTUs)/Combat Crew Training Squadrons
     (CCTSs), maintain separate trend data for students and qualified/instructor aircrews.
     3.2.2.4.4. When trends are noted, recommend corrective action and assign an
     OPR/Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR); report trends and status to the
     OG/CC during the SEB until closed. OGV will publish and define the trend program
     in the unit supplement to this instruction and maintain trend data for at least one year.
        3.2.2.4.4.1. (Added-PACAF) Units may include minimum sample size and
        percentages that constitute a trend in the unit supplement to this instruction. An
        evaluation area or test question with a discrepancy rate of 15% or higher is
        considered a trend unless inherent system capability dictates otherwise. If sample
        size is less than 20, three discrepancies are considered a trend.
     3.2.2.4.5. (Added-3WG) The OGV is the OPR for the Trends program; however,
     SQ/CCV will manage the squadron trends program and provide squadron trend
     information to OGV for group analysis. The SQ/CCV Chief will appoint a primary
     and alternate program manager for the squadron trends program.
     3.2.2.4.6. (Added-3WG) SQ/CCV will ensure all discrepancies from flight
     evaluations, emergency procedure evaluations, and written examinations are recorded
     and tracked. A computerized trend database is the primary method for tracking and
     recording trends.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                 15


        3.2.2.4.7. (Added-3WG) Informal Trends Identification. Feedback provided by
        crewmembers, squadron supervisors, instructors, and evaluators on day-to-day
        missions, instructional sorties, ground training sessions and evaluations may identify
        weak areas before they become formal Stan/Eval trends. Any weak areas identified
        in this manner will be forwarded to SQ/CCV who will compile and forward to OGV
        (via monthly reports) for analysis and possible inclusion in the formal Stan/Eval
        trends program. SQ/CCV should also develop a plan to reverse any informal trend.
        The OGV monthly stan/eval meeting will place emphasis on identifying informal
        trends.
        3.2.2.4.8. (Added-3WG) Time Period. Data collection is a continuous process,
        and trend analysis will normally be conducted on a floating 6-month period. The
        floating 6-month window allows for early identification of trends and appropriate
        action plans. Longer periods may be used if the sample size warrants it. Advise
        OGV via the monthly report if greater than 6 months were used to establish a trend.
        3.2.2.4.9. (Added-3WG) Trends Reporting and Tracking:
            3.2.2.4.9.1. (Added-3WG) Trends identified in the squadron will be forwarded
            to OGV via monthly reporting, unless more timely action is required. The
            squadron will work with OGV to assign an appropriate OPR, office of collateral
            responsibility (OCR) and develop realistic and effective courses of action to
            correct/stop negative trends. This corrective action will also be included in the
            monthly report. See paragraph 3.3.2.9, this publication, for requirements.
            3.2.2.4.9.2. (Added-3WG) All trends will be assigned a tracking number by
            OGV. OGV will analyze all formal and informal trends reported throughout the
            group and determine whether there are any trends that are applicable to the group
            as a whole. The OGV will inform all squadron CCV’s of group trends and
            identify them via flight crew information file (FCIF), special interest items (SII)
            and/or SEB. For trends developing early in any period, the OGV Chief will not
            wait until the SEB to initiate corrective action.
            3.2.2.4.9.3. (Added-3WG) Formal and informal trends should be closed out via
            the supplementary evaluation program if practical.
     3.2.2.5. Conduct Supplementary Evaluations as directed.
     3.2.2.6. Conduct a SEB and publish minutes IAW the minimum outline of this
     instruction (Attachment 2) and guidance in the MAJCOM supplement to this instruction.

        3.2.2.6.2. (Added-PACAF) Complete the SEB as soon as practical after the end of
        the semi-annual period (periods end 30 June and 31 December).
        3.2.2.6.3. (Added-PACAF) Forward SEB minutes to HQ PACAF/A3TV,
        AFRC/A3TV, 10 AF/A3V, parent HQ NAF/A3, and MDS similar PACAF units
        within 30 days following the SEB. Include all flight evaluation and EPE
        discrepancies noted during the semi-annual period.
        3.2.2.6.4. (Added-PACAF) Include the following in the unit SEB minutes.

        ready/combat mission ready (MR/CMR) status may perform duties as a flight examiner.
     4.2.7. (Added-3WG) Flight Examiner Upgrade Procedures:
        4.2.7.1. (Added-3WG) All prospective SEFEs will be approved for entry into upgrade
        by the 3 OG/ CC using the Flight Examiner Nomination Letter example found on the 3
        OGV webpage. The 3 OG/CC, or designated representative, will interview FEs upon
        completion of all unit defined upgrade events and certify them using the
        Standardization/Evaluation Flight Examiner Certification Letter example, found on the 3
        OGV webpage, prior to the SEFE conducting any unsupervised evaluations. Any FE not
        assigned at the squadron or OGV level must be approved, in writing, by the 3 OG/CC.
            4.2.7.1.1. (Added-3WG) Prospective C-17 evaluators will also be entered into
            training management system (Boeing)® (TMS) for flight examiner computer based
            training (CBT) through squadron training with squadron CCV approval (SQ/CC may
            waive requirements for previous flight examiners in accordance with AFI 11-2C-
            17V1, C-17 Aircrew Training).
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                 25


      4.2.7.2. (Added-3WG) SEFEs upgrading for the first time will monitor at least one of
      each type of evaluation pertinent to their mission design series (MDS) and crew position.
      Upgrading SEFEs will be administered an FE objectivity check ride (documented as a
      SPOT evaluation) by a current SEFE of the same crew position and MDS. The
      upgrading SEFE will not sign any AF Forms 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, for
      check rides accomplished during this upgrade. For previously qualified evaluators, the
      squadron commander may tailor the qualification program to the individual based on
      previous qualifications. As a minimum, previous evaluators will review PACAF and 3
      OG Supplements to applicable instructions with an evaluator, complete the SEFE test at 3
      OG/OGV and receive a FE objectivity check ride. Upon completion of the upgrade
      requirements, the completed squadron SEFE Certification Letter will be filed at the
      squadron CCV office, and a copy will be forwarded to 3 OG/OGV.
      4.2.7.3. (Added-3WG) The upgrading SEFE will monitor evaluations within their
      aircrew specialty during the upgrade. At least one evaluation will be administered or
      supervised by a 3 OG/OGV FE (if available). The squadron commander, or DO, will
      determine which squadron SEFE may fulfill this requirement should an OGV FE not be
      available.

        4.3.5.2. (Added-3WG) Prior to any flight evaluation, the SEFE will brief evaluation
        requirements in accordance with the 3 WG SEFE guide for the MDS. Following the
        flight, the SEFE will conduct a formal debriefing and critique with the examinee and
        examinee’s supervisor (SQ/CC or SQ/DO preferred). Supervisors may be back-briefed
        for evaluations graded Q-1.
            4.3.5.2.1. (Added-3WG) Supervisory         involvement      (SQ/CC/DO,        Flight
            Commanders, Operations Superintendents/Supervisors, Standardization/Evaluation)
            is a critical element in the success of the Standardization/Evaluation program.
            Supervisory attendance at evaluation debriefings is highly encouraged on every
            evaluation and will be documented in the comment block, under mission description,
            of the AF Forms 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (Multiple Aircraft). . If
            unable to attend, a supervisory debrief is required and will be documented in the
            comment block under mission description of the AF Form 8/8a.
     4.3.6. Immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline during an evaluation
     (this applies to all aircrew members). If this situation occurs, the flight examiner will also
     debrief unit supervision, as designated in the unit supplement, and if appropriate, document
     the deviation on an AF Form 8/8a.
     4.3.7. Immediately notify the examinee’s squadron commander/operations officer and flight
     commander whenever Qualification Level 2 or 3 (―Q-2‖ or ―Q-3‖) performance is observed.
        4.3.7.1. (Added-PACAF) If the flight commander does not supervise the examinee’s
        flying duties, the appropriate flying supervisor should be notified in addition to the
        examinee’s flight commander.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                   27


      4.3.7.2. (Added-3WG) One copy of all Q-2 and Q-3 evaluations and commander
      directed downgrades will be hand carried or e-mailed to 3 OG/OGV within 2 working
      days of the evaluation (or within 2 working days of the examiner’s return to home
      station).
   4.3.8. Will not administer evaluations outside of their MAJCOM unless specifically
   requested by the MAJCOM stan/eval organization of the examinee and approved by the
   MAJCOM stan/eval organization of the examiner.
   4.3.9. (Added-PACAF) HQ PACAF/A3TV flight examiners may perform flight examiner
   duties for PACAF-gained units/aircrews upon request by the unit commander.
   4.3.10. (Added-PACAF) Debrief a squadron supervisor (preferably the examinee’s
   supervisor) as soon as practical after the evaluation on the results and pertinent elements of
   the evaluation.
   4.3.11. (Added-3WG) If an evaluation results in a qualification level of less than Q-1, a
   formal debrief with the examinee will be administered with the SQ/CC or DO in attendance.
   Additionally, SQ/CCV will notify OGV who will in turn notify the 3 OG/CC.
   (EXCEPTION: If an evaluation results in a qualification level of less than Q-1 while off-
   station, the SEFE will contact the SQ/CC as soon as possible).
   4.3.12. (Added-3WG) If applicable, the SEFE administering the formal flight evaluation
   should not fly as an instructor for an individual's subsequent pre-evaluation flights.
4.4. Senior Flight Examiner Program.
   4.4.1. Flying NAF/CCs and OG/CCs may maintain flight examiner status in their primary
   assigned aircraft. Vice commanders and deputies may perform this function if the principal
   incumbent is not qualified or available.
   4.4.2. NAF/CCs, OG/CCs, and OG/CDs that fly different aircraft from the OG/CC in multi-
   MDS wings, do not require, nor do they have to maintain, instructor certification or
   MR/CMR status. To become a flight examiner, NAF/CCs, OG/CCs, and applicable OG/CDs,
   must maintain BMC status and be flight examiner certified. For other than SPOT evaluations,
   Senior Flight Examiners will evaluate only events for which they are current and at a level
   for which they are qualified.
4.5. Aircrew positions that do not require a flight phase evaluation do not require flight
examiners.

                                           Chapter 5

                                        EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes three types of evaluations to ensure
qualification of aircrew members and standardization of operations. Aircrew qualification
evaluations are administered periodically and documented on the AF Forms 8/8a to ensure
aircrew qualification. EPEs are requisites for some aircrew qualification evaluations.
Supplementary evaluations are unstructured tools to be used by the commander to ensure
standardization of flying and other operations.
     5.1.1. (Added-3WG) Formal course student evaluations. Prior to administering an
     evaluation that completes a formal upgrade, SEFEs will ensure all requisites are completed.
     If possible, SEFEs should not administer evaluations to aircrew when more than 50 percent
     of the examinee’s upgrade training, or the last flight prior to the flight evaluation, was
     conducted by the SEFE.
5.2. Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. Aircrew qualification evaluations consist of two
structured phases, ground and flight. Each phase requires the completion of requisite tasks. The
ground phase, when required, includes a series of examinations and evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment. The flight phase includes an
inflight or, if applicable, simulator evaluation of aircrew performance. EXCEPTION: For
specialized aircrew qualified IAW Universal Qualification guidance see paragraph 5.2.18
     5.2.1. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Categories. There are five types of aircrew
     qualification evaluations. Periodic aircrew qualification evaluations are administered to
     ensure basic qualification in the MDS and crew position of an aircrew member (QUAL),
     qualification to operate in instrument meteorological conditions (INSTM, when applicable)
     and qualification to employ the MDS of the air-crew member in accomplishing the unit’s
     operational mission (MSN). Evaluations are accomplished to ensure aircrew are certified and
     maintain instructor qualification (INSTR). Evaluation and certification of specific aircrew
     performance may also be accomplished (SPOT). Aircrew will complete the following types
     of aircrew certification evaluations as appropriate:
        5.2.1.1. QUAL Evaluations. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in
        their primary assigned aircraft, to include requisites, as specified in the applicable AFI
        11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
            5.2.1.1.1. (Added-3WG) Loadmaster QUAL/MSN evaluations should be
            administered on off-station missions. Exceptions to policy may be approved by
            SQ/CC prior to scheduling the evaluation. Notify 3 OG/OGV each time an exception
            is made.
        5.2.1.2. INSTM Evaluations. All Air Force pilots (and other pilots flying operationally
        with the Air Force, e.g., exchange pilots) will maintain instrument qualification.
        EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI 11-401,
        Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft pilots;
        USAFA T-41 and T-51 pilots. Note: Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may also be
        assigned to other aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument qualification in
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                 29


     non-excepted aircraft. To obtain/maintain instrument qualification, pilots must
     successfully complete a periodic INSTM evaluation.
        5.2.1.2.1. A commander may revoke the instrument qualification of any pilot under
        his/her command who fails to maintain minimum instrument flying skills. To revoke
        an instrument qualification for reasons not related to an evaluation, use the
        procedures in Chapter 7 for a commander-directed downgrade.
        5.2.1.2.2. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification may not fly as a
        pilot in aircraft in which instrument qualification is required except in a training
        program leading to requalification. Pilots in this situation must be in supervised
        status. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed in paragraph 5.2.1.2)
        5.2.1.2.3. (Added-PACAF) For INSTM/QUAL flight evaluations for non-
        experienced fighter pilots, mission tasks other than required by 11-2MDS Vol 2 will
        be BFM or non-demanding events.
        5.2.1.2.4. (Added-3WG) F-15/F-22 Instrument Evaluations. Inexperienced pilots
        will be scheduled for a dedicated instrument sortie. Experienced pilots will not be
        scheduled for a sortie that would cause the examinee not to complete the
        planned/briefed profile. Inexperienced pilots will fly their instrument evaluation to a
        location other than Elmendorf.
     5.2.1.3. MSN Evaluations. All aircrew members maintaining MR/CMR or BMC
     aircrew status will complete a periodic MSN evaluation in their primary assigned aircraft,
     to include requisites, as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
     The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required in the
     performance of normal operational and training sorties. The requirement for a MSN
     evaluation may be waived for those aircraft where performance of normal operational,
     test and training sorties involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM
     and/or QUAL evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2. QUAL and
     MSN evaluations may be combined into a single evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2
     MDS-Specific Volumes 2.
        5.2.1.3.1. (Added-PACAF) C-130 assault procedures will normally be evaluated
        during the examinee's MSN evaluation. For those pilots who are assault-only mission
        qualified, the assault procedures evaluation may be combined with the
        INSTM/QUAL evaluation (INSTM/ QUAL/MSN). Include the following restriction
        on the AF Form 8: "The examinee is an Assault-Only MSN qualified pilot". ANG
        units may combine assault procedures evaluations with the INSTM/QUAL
        evaluations and IAW local guidance.
        5.2.1.3.2. (Added-3WG) Mission evaluations should be flown using the highest
        qualification of the examinee.
     5.2.1.4. INSTR Evaluations. Aircrew members maintaining instructor qualification in a
     particular MDS aircraft must complete initial and periodic evaluations of instructional
     capability in that MDS aircraft. Specialized qualified, universally qualified, or multiple
     qualified aircrew maintaining instructor qualification in multiple similar aircraft will
     accomplish initial and periodic evaluations as specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or
     AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2.
30                              AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


        5.2.1.4.1. To initially qualify as an instructor in a particular MDS aircraft, the aircrew
        member must successfully complete an initial instructor (INIT INSTR) evaluation.
        Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions whenever
        possible. When students are not available or mission requirements/crew composition
        requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator may
        serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability.
        5.2.1.4.2. Periodic evaluation of the ability of aircrew members to instruct will be
        conducted during all subsequent periodic evaluations. The AF Form 8/8a
        Mission/Check description for these periodic evaluations will not include INSTR as
        the AF Form 8/8a aircraft/crew position is already annotated with highest
        qualification demonstrated during the previous evaluation (e.g. IB, IN, IP).
        5.2.1.4.3. If instructor qualification is lost in an MDS aircraft, it may be regained
        through an instructor requalification evaluation (see paragraphs 5.2.3.2.2 and
        5.2.3.2.4) as directed in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1.
        5.2.1.4.4. (Added-PACAF) Perform initial and requalification INSTR evaluations
        with the examinee occupying the seat/crew/flight position normally occupied when
        acting as an instructor. The emphasis on an initial instructor evaluation should be
        placed on examinee demonstration of instructional ability. This does not preclude the
        update of a required periodic evaluation, unless restricted by AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2, if
        all required flight phase requirements are completed during the instructor flight
        evaluation and the examinee subsequently completes all ground phase requirements
        for the evaluation within the periods described in paragraph 5.2.7 Label the
        evaluation appropriately (EXAMPLE: "INIT INSTR/MSN"). Do not add on missions
        (sorties) to complete the requirements for a periodic evaluation unless the group/
        squadron commander concurs.
        5.2.1.4.5. (Added-3WG) F-15C Instructor Pilot Rear Cockpit (RCP)
        Evaluations. All RCP landing qualified instructor pilots (IP) must be designated as
        such via AF Form 8 in accordance with MDS Volume 2 procedures. The RCP
        landing qualification may occur on any sortie during the upgrade program. If not
        completed by or during the actual instructor evaluation sortie, the instructor (INSTR)
        AF Form 8 must contain the following statement after ADDITIONAL EXAMINER
        REMARKS: ―Not qualified to perform rear cockpit landing instructor duties until
        successful completion of a RCP landing SPOT evaluation.‖
     5.2.1.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional). A SPOT evaluation is an
     evaluation not intended to satisfy the requirements of a periodic evaluation (e.g., INSTM,
     QUAL, MSN or INSTR). SPOT evaluations have no specific requisites or requirements,
     unless specified in MAJCOM supplements. An evaluation that begins as a SPOT
     evaluation may become (and be documented as) a required periodic evaluation if all
     required flight phase requirements are completed during the SPOT eval and the examinee
     subsequently completes all ground phase requirements for the evaluation within the
     periods described in paragraph 5.2.7 Do not add on missions (flights) to complete the
     requirements for a periodic evaluation unless the group/squadron commander concurs
     with the aircrew member’s desire to realign the evaluation expiration date and approves
     the additional flight time requirements. Evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1 -
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                       31


       5.2.1.4 will be documented as SPOT evaluations. Note: When the flight examiner
       administering a SPOT evaluation is not qualified in the MDS and same crew position of
       the examinee, the evaluation will not be credited towards a periodic evaluation.
           5.2.1.5.1. (Added-PACAF) Flight examiner objectivity evaluations are SPOT
           evaluations used by HHQ flight examiners, commanders, and OGV flight examiners
           to evaluate flight examiner performance. Do not conduct unless qualified in the same
           MDS as the flight examiner being evaluated. Do not use flight examiner objectivity
           evaluations to fulfill the requirements of periodic evaluations. Use the grading criteria
           for the areas listed in Table 5.1 (Added) Only Q-1 or Q-3 qualification levels will be
           used. Award a Q-3 if a grade of Q- with additional training or a U in any area is
           awarded. Consider cumulative deviations when determining the qualification level.
           The OG/CC will determine the future status of any flight examiner receiving a Q-3.
           Document evaluation on the AF Form 8 (an example Form 8 is provided in Figure
           A3.12
               5.2.1.5.1.1. (Added-PACAF) If an examinee assigns incorrect area grading or
               assigns an incorrect qualification level, the flight examiner administering the
               flight examiner objectivity evaluation will assign the appropriate area grade or
               qualification level and complete the documentation for the evaluation being
               administered by the examinee.

            5.2.1.5.2. (Added-3WG) Spot Evaluations will be used to document an initial flight
            examiner certification.
     5.2.2. Combined Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. To promote efficient use of flying
     resources, accomplish evaluations concurrently, whenever practical. If combined, include the
     designation of each evaluation in the Flight Phase of the AF Form 8, e.g., QUAL/MSN or
     INSTM/QUAL/MSN. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM
     supplements.
     5.2.3. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used,
     when applicable, to further describe the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1 -5.2.1.5:
        5.2.3.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for a crew position or instructor
        qualification in an MDS (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT MSN, INIT INSTR).
        5.2.3.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
        qualification due to expiration of a required periodic evaluation, loss of currency, a flight
        recheck following a failed periodic evaluation (see paragraph 7.3.9 for ground rechecks),
        or loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                   33


        5.2.3.2.1. When loss of qualification is for expiration of a required periodic
        evaluation, the evaluation given will be IAW the guidance for that periodic
        evaluation. The AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an
        RQ prefix. Note: When expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure
        to complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.2.4), the
        flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period for an
        in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in paragraph 5.2.7.2 for
        an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, and the OG/CC determines that
        qualification will be re-established by completion of the ground requisites without re-
        accomplishment of the flight evaluation or completed ground requisites as outlined in
        paragraph 5.2.16, the AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will not be
        documented with an RQ prefix.
        5.2.3.2.2. When loss of qualification is due to loss of currency, the evaluation profile
        will be as directed by the squadron commander and will include, as a minimum, those
        items for which the individual is non-current. The AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check
        description will be documented with RQ SPOT. See also AFI 11-202, Volume 1,
        Aircrew Training, for policy regarding loss of currency.
        5.2.3.2.3. When loss of qualification is for failure to pass a flight evaluation, the
        recheck evaluation will be IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.2.13 The AF Form 8/8a
        Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT, as
        applicable.
        5.2.3.2.4. When loss of qualification is due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
        paragraph 7.4.8), the evaluation profile will be as directed by the commander. The AF
        Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ
        SPOT, as applicable.
        5.2.3.2.5. Do not use RQ to prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
        qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
        5.2.3.2.6. When requalification deals with instructor capability, the AF Form 8/8a
        Mission/ Check description will be documented with RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
     5.2.3.3. No-Notice (N/N). A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified
     of the evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. The
     beginning of normal preparation for a mission will be determined by the flight examiner
     and may be defined in supplements to this instruction. The intent is to preclude
     extraordinary preparation for the mission.
        5.2.3.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
        daily air-crew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
            5.2.3.3.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Publish unit no-notice program objectives and
            goals in the unit supplement to this instruction.
               5.2.3.3.1.1.1. (Added-3WG) No-Notice (N/N) Evaluation Program and
               Goals. The goal of the N/N program is to assess unit readiness and identify
               potential weak areas or trends to senior leadership.
               5.2.3.3.1.1.2. (Added-3WG) The 3 OG annual no-notice goal is 15% of
34                                  AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


                    available and qualified crewmembers. All qualified crewmembers are eligible
                    for no-notice evaluations. No-notice evaluations may be in the form of a
                    ground evaluation, flight evaluation, or both. An individual crewmember
                    should not receive more than one no-notice or spot evaluation per calendar
                    year (EXCEPTION: ASEV and/or commander-directed evaluations).
            5.2.3.3.2. An examinee may utilize a no-notice evaluation to update a
            QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
            evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.2.7 If all
            requirements were not completed on the first flight, subsequent flights are authorized
            to complete required events. If the examinee elects not to update a
            QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date, the evaluation will be documented
            as a N/N SPOT evaluation.
            5.2.3.3.3. (Added-3WG) N/N evaluations will not be used for initial or upgrade
            qualification evaluations. Evaluations will be approved or directed by the 3 OG/CC,
            SQ/CC, DO or 3 OG/ OGV. SQ/CCV will be the focal point for no-notice
            evaluations.
            5.2.3.3.4. (Added-3WG) As a minimum, all N/N evaluations will include items
            designated under ―General‖ as defined in the appropriate aircrew member’s chapter
            of the AFI 11-2MDS Volume 2. Evaluate other areas, as appropriate. Evaluators will
            use items from the special interest program to target and assess specific areas during
            all N/N evaluations. An evaluator will not change the mission profile in order to
            evaluate a specific area; however, the evaluator may direct a specific maneuver/item
            if the maneuver has been determined to be a weak area or trend and does not interfere
            with normal mission profile.
            5.2.3.3.5. (Added-3WG) SQ/CCV will maintain a N/N log. This log is to be
            maintained for each calendar year and N/N check rides will be included in each unit’s
            monthly standardization/ evaluation report to OGV. Any N/N check rides
            administered by OGV will also be logged in the unit’s tracking system.
            5.2.3.3.6. (Added-3WG) Squadron Commanders will develop criteria for no-notice
            evaluation eligibility. The criteria should include, as a minimum; multiple
            downgrades on previous check rides, recently upgraded to current certification,
            observed substandard performance and normal no-notice evaluation distribution.
        5.2.3.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
        in a simulator.
        5.2.3.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
        (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
        evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes will be explained under Mission Description
        in the Examiner’s Remarks (see paragraphs 7.3.7.3 and 7.4.7.3).
     5.2.4. Ground Phase Requisites. The ground phase for periodic aircrew evaluations
     includes requisites listed below. See Chapter 6 of this instruction for additional guidance on
     aircrew examinations.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                     35


     5.2.4.1. QUAL Evaluations. Open book examination, closed book examination,
     Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
     5.2.4.2. INSTM Evaluations. Instrument examination.
     5.2.4.3. MSN Evaluations. As specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
         5.2.4.3.1. (Added-PACAF) MAF pilots, navigators, flight engineers, and
         loadmasters will accomplish the MAF open book tactics exam as a requisite for their
         mission evaluation (N/A for aeromedical evacuation crew members, flight attendants,
         communications system operators and UH-1 aircrew). Boom operators will
         accomplish the MAF tactics exam as a requisite for their QUAL/MSN flight
         evaluation and not in association with their MSN CARGO evaluation.
             5.2.4.3.1.1. (Added-PACAF) AMC tactics has created a classified secure
             question bank (SQB) for each MDS. They may be obtained (OG/CC or
             designated rep) by contacting AMC/A3D at DSN 312-779-1765. Instructions for
             obtaining     the   SQB      are   also   available   on      SIPRNET       at:
             http://www.amc.scott.af.smil.mil/hosted_orgs/dok/ and select "go60 tactics and
             training".
             5.2.4.3.1.2. (Added-PACAF) Unit tactics personnel will produce and administer
             the tactics exam using questions from the AMC tactics SQB (minimum of 25
             questions). Tactics exams are not crewmember specific and only two test versions
             are required IAW para 6.4.1.1. Tactics exam scores will be passed to STAN
             EVAL for inclusion on the form 8. Document the tactics examination under the
             ground phase examination block as ―TACTICS.‖ If there is not sufficient room in
             the ground phase block, annotate ―TACTICS‖ with date and score in the
             comments section. OG/CCs are encouraged to use resources at their disposal to
             provide suitable classified testing and study areas. Access to electronic
             publications is preferred where practical.
  5.2.5. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
  in the MDS or, if applicable, a suitable simulator profile that will allow evaluation of aircrew
  performance. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
  appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, and allow
  accurate measure of the proficiency of the examinee. Evaluation profiles will reflect unit
  tasking, daily training missions, be realistic, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the
  unit mission.
  5.2.6. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
     5.2.6.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the
     17th month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a
     periodic evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 04 expires on 31
     Mar 06.).
     5.2.6.2. Scheduling. Schedule periodic evaluations in the eligibility period (six-month
     period prior to expiration date).
         5.2.6.2.1. (Added-3WG) Flight evaluations should be completed no later than the
         5th month of the individual’s eligibility period.

     5.2.6.3. Extended Evaluations. Periodic evaluations may be extended on a case-by-
     case basis according to the following criteria:
        5.2.6.3.1. Squadron Commander-Extended Evaluations. Squadron commanders
        may extend the expiration date of periodic evaluations up to three months for the
        reasons listed below.
           5.2.6.3.1.1. Individuals assigned PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
           5.2.6.3.1.2. Individuals departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft
           type.
           5.2.6.3.1.3. Individuals undergoing unit aircraft conversion.
           5.2.6.3.1.4. Individual removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or
           retirement from the Service).
           5.2.6.3.1.5. Individuals participating in real world operations (to include
           operations other than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required
           flight evaluation(s) before or during deployment. This will be on a case-by-case
           basis and is not authority to grant blanket extensions for scheduled operational
           deployments.
        5.2.6.3.2. For squadron commanders and above, the approval authority is the next
        commander in the member’s flying chain of command, with the concurrence of the
        member’s immediate supervisor, IAW the guidance provided in paragraph 5.2.6.3.1
        For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval authority.
        5.2.6.3.3. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize the
        extension of expiration dates of periodic aircrew qualification evaluations.
        5.2.6.3.4. Documentation. Document extensions with a memorandum for record
        (MFR) placed in Section II of the FEF specifying extension authority, the new
        expiration date, and include a brief description of the extension.
           5.2.6.3.4.1. Extension MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any
           affected periodic evaluation.
           5.2.6.3.4.2. File the MFR on top of the affected AF Form 8/8a in Section II of the
           FEF.
           5.2.6.3.4.3. Requisites not completed during original eligibility period must be
           completed prior to extended expiration date indicated on the MFR.
           5.2.6.3.4.4. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
           AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments,
           when action is complete and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record
           become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed
           by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a. Example: If an
           evaluation was extended based on an HHQ waiver, an MFR will remain in the
           FEF until such time as the next evaluation is completed. That waiver reference is
           commented on in para D of the Form 8/8a.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                   37


     5.2.6.4. Requirements Before Permanent Change of Station/Temporary Duty. If a
     periodic evaluation will expire within three months after the proposed departure for a
     Permanent Change of Station (PCS) to a flying assignment in the same aircraft MDS, or
     during an upcoming Temporary Duty (TDY) (flying or non-flying), complete the
     required evaluation(s) before departing for either the PCS flying assignment or the TDY.
     Obtain a MAJCOM stan/eval waiver for unusual situations.
  5.2.7. Requisite Completion. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements
  of combined evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2. Requisites from a
  completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations provided they cover all
  required areas and are within the requisite zone for each evaluation. See also paragraph 5.3.1.
  For aircrew possessing multiple instrument qualifications, the instrument exam may count for
  separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs for each evaluation IAW the
  provisions of paragraphs 5.2.7.1 and 5.2.7.2 For all evaluations, accomplish requisites as
  follows:
     5.2.7.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
     the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the six-month eligibility
     period prior to the expiration date of the current evaluation period to update that
     expiration date.
     5.2.7.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations outside the eligibility
     period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period encompassing the
     month in which the flight evaluation was administered. EXCEPTION: For extended
     evaluations, requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
     eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
     5.2.7.3. Recheck. For evaluations used to remedy a failed evaluation:
         5.2.7.3.1. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.2.7.1 or
         5.2.7.2 remain valid, IAW paragraph 5.2.13.1
         5.2.7.3.2. Valid requisite completion dates from the Q-3 AF Form 8/8a will not be
         annotated on the recheck AF Form 8/8a. The recheck AF Form 8/8a will only include
         documentation of the flight phase evaluation, unless requisites were not completed or
         are required to complete the recheck. If the flight recheck is completed prior to
         completion of required requisites, delay completion of the AF Form 8/8a until
         requisites are complete and enter the requisites on the recheck AF Form 8/8a.
     5.2.7.4. (Added-3WG) Completion of Flight Evaluation Requisites.                   Flight
     evaluation requisites should be completed prior to administering an evaluation. Squadron
     CCV will develop a process to ensure that requisites not completed prior to the
     evaluations are completed in accordance with paragraph 5.2.7 (parent regulation).
  5.2.8. Alternate Means of Evaluation. When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not
  possible, the area may be evaluated verbally or in an Aircrew Training Device (ATD). Flight
  examiners will make every effort to evaluate all required areas in-flight before resorting to
  this option. See the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, for areas prohibited from
  verbal/ATD evaluation.
38                                  AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


     5.2.9. Evaluation Criteria Source. The MAJCOM designated as lead command in AFPD
     10-9, in coordination with other user commands, will establish and maintain standardized
     INSTM, INSTR, MSN and QUAL evaluation criteria in the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-
     Specific Volume 2. The lead command is responsible for coordinating the establishment of:
        5.2.9.1. Areas/subareas to be used for documenting required evaluations including those
        required and critical for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged
        into general and specific evaluation areas. Where required, mission areas/subareas will be
        further subdivided into general and specific mission areas.
        5.2.9.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Check. This is required for QUAL
        evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
            5.2.9.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for required flight publications as
            outlined in applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific series publications.
                5.2.9.2.1.1. (Added-3WG) SEFEs will conduct a publications check as a
                requisite for all recurring evaluations. FEs will inspect all publications issued to
                the aircrew member. Any SEFE (of the same MDS) may conduct the requisite
                publications check.
            5.2.9.2.2. Satisfactory performance requires individual flight publications be current
            and properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
            members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
            required for the mission.
        5.2.9.3. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM) evaluation criteria in the
        appropriate areas/ subareas. Use AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management
        Training Program, and MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
        5.2.9.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
        and procedures. Must specifically ensure compliance with minimum safe maneuvering
        speeds below 10,000 ft MSL and NAS awareness in all areas of mission planning and
        flight operations.
     5.2.10. Grading System. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and document
     aircrew performance. On one level, individual scores are recorded for examinations while
     areas/subareas of aircrew performance are individually graded against established evaluation
     criteria. Performance less than fully qualified is documented. On the second level, an overall
     qualification level is determined from the compilation of these individual scores/grades.
        5.2.10.1. Area/Subarea Grades. AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 will establish
        areas and subareas to be evaluated during emergency procedure and other evaluations - to
        include the appropriate grading criteria for those areas/subareas. Areas/subareas will have
        a two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system. Discrepancies will be
        documented against the listed subareas.
            5.2.10.1.1. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a
            satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within
            the prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
            5.2.10.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned
            area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                   39


        flight examiner. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the
        prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety.
        5.2.10.1.3. U indicates a breach of flight discipline, performance outside allowable
        parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely
        affected mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee
        receiving an area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in
        the judgment of the flight examiner, additional training will not constructively
        improve examinee’s performance, it is not required. In this case, the flight examiner
        must thoroughly debrief the examinee.
     5.2.10.2. Critical Area. The lead MAJCOM is responsible for the establishment of
     evaluation areas that, upon failure, would most adversely affect the qualification of an
     aircrew member. Critical areas include, but are not limited to, Airmanship, Flight
     Discipline and Safety. Grade all critical areas as either Qualified (Q) or Unqualified (U).
     5.2.10.3. Qualification Levels. EPEs and overall evaluation performance are graded by
     qualification levels as follows:
        5.2.10.3.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The aircrew member demonstrated desired
        performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within
        tolerances specified in the grading criteria. This will be awarded when no
        discrepancies were noted, and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
            5.2.10.3.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any
            area(s)/subarea(s).
            5.2.10.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies
            preclude awarding of an overall Qualification Level 1.
            5.2.10.3.1.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during
            the debrief of that evaluation.
        5.2.10.3.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The aircrew member demonstrated the
        ability to perform duties safely, but:
            5.2.10.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training
            was assigned.
            5.2.10.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
            5.2.10.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based on
            performance in one or several areas/subareas.
        5.2.10.3.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The aircrew member demonstrated an
        unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge.
            5.2.10.3.3.1. An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires an overall Q-3
            for the evaluation.
            5.2.10.3.3.2. An overall Q-3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight
            examiner, there is justification based on performance in one or several
            areas/subareas.
40                                 AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


        5.2.10.4. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs examinations as either Qualified (Q)
        or Unqualified (U).
        5.2.10.5. Written, Computer Based, or Electronic Examinations. Grade written,
        computer based, or electronic examinations as a percentage of correct answers. See
        paragraph 6.4.4.1 for minimum passing grade criteria.
     5.2.11. Grading Policies.
        5.2.11.1. Requisite Examinations. The flight examiner will consider performance on
        requisite examinations in assigning the overall qualification level.
        5.2.11.2. Performance Areas/Subareas. Use the two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-
        /U) grading system when applying the grading criteria definitions specified in the
        applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, to grade areas/subareas.
            5.2.11.2.1. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as ―required‖ in
            the general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
            Volume 2.
            5.2.11.2.2. The flight examiner will grade any area/subarea observed during an
            evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts the specific evaluation
            accomplished or flight safety.
            5.2.11.2.3. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft
            conditions.
            5.2.11.2.4. Minor momentary deviations from grading criteria tolerances are
            acceptable, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such
            deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider cumulative deviations when
            determining the overall area/subarea grade.
            5.2.11.2.5. The flight examiner may further identify an area/sub-area as
            ―Commendable‖ if, in the examiner’s determination, the aircrew member has
            demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in that particular area/sub-area.
            Document commendable areas in the examiner’s remarks section of the AF Form
            8/8a.
        5.2.11.3. Overall Qualification Levels.
            5.2.11.3.1. The overall qualification level awarded on an evaluation is based on
            performance during both the flight and ground phases. An overall grade of Q-1 or Q-
            2 will be awarded only after all evaluation requirements have been completed and
            given due consideration. An overall grade of Q-3 may be awarded at any time.
            5.2.11.3.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the aircrew member must
            satisfy the criteria set forth in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, and
            demonstrate ability to operate the aircraft and/or equipment safely and effectively
            during all phases of an evaluation.
            5.2.11.3.3. Overall qualification grades will be a cumulative process. While AFI 11-2
            MDS Specific Volume 2 guidance may dictate the highest grade for a flight or EPE
            based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will always be the
            determining factor in deciding the overall qualification level.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                  41


     5.2.11.4. Exceptionally Qualified Designation. An exceptionally qualified designation
     may be awarded by the flight examiner. The designation can only be applied to the total
     evaluation - not to separate requisites. The designation may be awarded when:
         5.2.11.4.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
         all phases of the evaluation;
         5.2.11.4.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
         5.2.11.4.3. The aircrew member received a qualified grade with no remedial action
         on all areas/subareas evaluated during emergency procedures and flight evaluations.
  5.2.12. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or less require action to remedy the discrepancy
  and/or deficiency in performance. Remedial action includes debriefing discrepancies and/or
  assignment of additional training. See paragraph 5.2.13 when discrepancies result in failure
  to pass a flight evaluation.
     5.2.12.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the
     evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides briefing/instruction concerning the
     discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
     proficiency to remedy the discrepancy. The discrepancy area/subarea description is
     annotated with ―Debriefed‖ in paragraph B of the Examiner’s Remarks section of the AF
     Form 8/8a Comments.
     5.2.12.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by a flight examiner to
     remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
         5.2.12.2.1. Additional training may include self-study, ground instruction, use of a
         simulator or flying. To complete additional training, the examinee must demonstrate
         attainment of satisfactory knowledge or proficiency.
         5.2.12.2.2. Additional training is documented in paragraph C, Recommended
         Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks in the AF Form 8/8a Comments
         section. Description of assigned additional training will include how satisfactory
         knowledge or proficiency will be demonstrated to a flight examiner or instructor.
         5.2.12.2.3. Due dates and dates on which additional training is completed will be
         documented in the appropriate areas of the AF Form 8/8a (see paragraphs 7.3.5.5 and
         7.4.5.5).
         5.2.12.2.4. The flight examiner or instructor who completed the additional training
         will sign as the Certifying Official under Additional Training, Section II, verifying
         completion of all assigned training as documented in paragraph C, Recommended
         Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks.
         5.2.12.2.5. Commanders will ensure required additional training is completed.
         Accomplish additional training by the last day of the third month following the date
         of the discrepancy, e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 06, additional training must be
         accomplished by 30 Apr 06. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for
         completion of additional training, the squadron commander will review the situation
         and direct appropriate action. Document the circumstances with an MFR placed in
         Section II of the FEF of the affected individual. Incorporate the information contained
         in the MFR onto the affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D,
42                                  AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


            Additional Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFRs from the FEF.
            Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major
            discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
                5.2.12.2.5.1. (Added-PACAF) If the examinee completes additional training
                that differs from that recommended by the flight examiner (recommended
                additional training changed by reviewing or approving officer), document the
                additional training and justify the change in the Additional Reviews section of the
                AF Form 8.
                5.2.12.2.5.2. (Added-3WG) Additional Training Follow-Up. Procedures for
                documentation and tracking of corrective actions for failed tests/evaluations will
                be developed by each squadron in conjunction with OGV as part of the 3 OG
                standardized Go/No-Go process to ensure crewmembers do not fly unsupervised
                while unqualified.
     5.2.13. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
        5.2.13.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or
        ground recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first
        failure, e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 07, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 07. A
        recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q criteria (Q or
        Q-/debriefed) for each area graded U. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the time limits in
        this paragraph on a case-by-case basis. Document such action with an MFR placed in
        Section II of the FEF. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
        AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when
        action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a
        permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not
        addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a. Every reasonable effort must be made to
        requalify the individual. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed
        during this period, based on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and
        hours of training required. The flight examiner that administered the original check will
        not normally administer the recheck.
        5.2.13.2. Status Downgrade. Downgrade aircrew members receiving a Q-3 INSTM,
        QUAL or MSN evaluation to non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-
        CMR), non-basic mission capable (N-BMC), or non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ)
        status, as applicable. For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC)
        need not be downgraded if the discrepancies were only in instructor areas.
     5.2.14. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
     judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
     successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
        5.2.14.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
        requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
            5.2.14.1.1. Substandard performance in any area/subarea may require restrictions to
            ensure operational safety or mission accomplishment.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                   43


         5.2.14.1.2. If defined in the MDS specific Volume 1 and/or Volume 2 , formal
         schoolhouses will include restrictions on the AF Forms 8 for any core item not
         accomplished due to training limimitations, regardless if the method of qualification
         is by evaluation or instructor certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew
         perform core items in which they are not qualified unless under the direct supervision
         of an instructor. In this case, MDS specific guidance will set the time requirement for
         completion of additional training.
     5.2.14.2. Specific restrictions and the criteria for the removal of the restrictions will be
     documented as the first item of the AF Form 8/8a Comments. Restrictions associated
     with failed requisite examinations will not be documented on the AF Form 8/8a.
     5.2.14.3. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q-3 on an evaluation until a successful evaluation
     is completed:
         5.2.14.3.1. For QUAL evaluations, place the examinee on supervised status in the
         aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the
         evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For specialized
         qualified, universally qualified, or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining
         qualification for similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2
         may direct supervised status in all aircraft in which the individual maintains
         qualification.
         5.2.14.3.2. For INSTM evaluations, restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
         examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
         5.2.14.3.3. MSN       Evaluation.    The      examinee      may      perform    basic
         qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
         supervised status for mission tasks.
         5.2.14.3.4. INSTR Evaluation. Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any
         instructor area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is
         completed.
  5.2.15. Supervised Status. If unsatisfactory performance or restriction requires the aircrew
  member be placed on supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated
  supervisor) will be determined by the squadron commander (or equivalent) and as specified
  in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1. Supervision will be accomplished by instructors or
  designated supervisors (as specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1) qualified in the
  specific aircrew position.
  5.2.16. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
  member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
  eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in
  paragraph 5.2.7.2 for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, the aircrew member loses
  the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph 5.2.14.3 apply.
  Qualification may be re-established by administering a requalification evaluation (see
  paragraph 5.2.3.2) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation. OG/CCs may approve
  waivers to preclude the re-accomplishment of completed requisites to complete the
  evaluation on a case-by-case basis. Document such action with an MFR placed in Section II
  of the FEF. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected AF Form
44                                  AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


     8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when action is complete,
     and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF
     only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a
     later Form 8/8a.
        5.2.16.1. (Added-3WG) Crewmembers who fail to complete an evaluation within the
        required period will be put in supervised status until the evaluation is completed.
     5.2.17. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members
     who maintain qualification in two or more mission design series aircraft. When differences
     between series aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead MAJCOM, in
     coordination with using MAJ-COMs, will identify requirements for separate qualification
     requirements. When separate qualification is not required, document certification in different
     MDS series using AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training, or AF Form
     4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification
     document signed by an authorized official (such as a Letter of X’s).
        5.2.17.1. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
        including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained, in an MFR placed in
        Section II of the FEF. (For Air Force Materiel Command [AFMC], MAJCOM authority
        may be delegated, but not lower than wing commander.) See AFI 11-202, Volume 1, for
        additional guidance.
            5.2.17.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Units may use a ―Letter of Xs‖ as a unit certification
            document.
        5.2.17.2. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
        include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified
        by the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are
        directed by the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
        5.2.17.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL
        evaluation, and, if applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each mission
        design series aircraft according to applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2. When
        specified IAW paragraph 5.2.17, QUAL and MSN evaluations are required for different
        series aircraft in the same MDS.
            5.2.17.3.1. (Added-PACAF) For pilots qualified in multiple MDS (i.e. C-37 & C-
            40) a recurring eval must be accomplished in each aircraft. For communication
            system operators (CSO), flight attendants (FA), and Aeromedical Evacuation Crew
            Members (AECM or ACM) qualified on multiple MDS, one evaluation in the
            eligibility period will satisfy recurring qualification requirements in all aircraft
            assigned. Closed and open book examinations will contain representative questions
            from respective flight manuals, and EPEs will include discussions on aircraft
            differences in systems, performance, and limits. For all crew positions a separate
            initial qualification eval must be accomplished on each aircraft assigned.
        5.2.17.4. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q-3 on an INSTM evaluation results
        in a downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A
        downgrade resulting from a Q-3 in QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                     45


     for which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the
     discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft.
     5.2.17.5. (Added-PACAF) PACAF/A3 authorizes PACAF CSO’s and FA’s multiple
     MDS qualification on C-37A and C-40B aircraft. HQ PACAF/A3T is the approval
     authority for other exceptions to this paragraph.
  5.2.18. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized
  aircrew who maintain qualification in two or more mission design series aircraft where
  qualification is attained/maintained via a minimum of a ground phase examination.
  MAJCOMs may require a flight phase evaluation. AE crewmembers require a ground and
  flight phase evaluation, IAW AFI 11-2AE, Volume 2. The flight phase evaluation, when
  required, may be accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either
  gaining or maintaining qualification, and will update qualification on all aircraft listed on the
  specialized aircrew member’s Aeronautical Order (AO). MAJCOMs may specify additional
  ground phase requisites.
     5.2.18.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualifications
     IAW Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified
     crewmember eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
         5.2.18.1.1. (Added-PACAF) The following specialized aircrews are authorized to
         maintain qualification in two or more mission design series aircraft IAW Universal
         Qualification guidance: Flight Surgeons, Combat Rescue Officer, Pararescuemen,
         Aerial Still Photographers, and Aerial Broadcasters.
     5.2.18.2. Documentation. Specialized aircrew qualifications maintained under
     Universal qualification guidance will be documented on an AF Form 8a, IAW paragraph
     7.4 AECM qualification will be documented using AF Form 8, IAW paragraph 7.3 Flight
     surgeon qualification may be documented using either AF Form 8 or AF Form 8a, IAW
     paragraph 8.2.8 or paragraph 8.2.9
     5.2.18.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications
     maintained under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A
     MSN evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2
     and/or MAJCOM supplement to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will
     include a flight phase evaluation in one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member
     maintains qualification.
     5.2.18.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally
     qualified aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in
     loss of applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI 11-2 MDS-
     Specific Volumes 2.
  5.2.19. Aircrews Flying in Non-US Air Force Aircraft and with Non-US Air Force
  Units. Aircrew members authorized to perform duties in non-US Air Force aircraft IAW
  AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached to non-US Air Force units for flying, abide by host
  service or host country guidance, except for the requirement to maintain a current physical
  and review their flight records according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1. They do not necessarily
  abide by USAF guidance, including AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
  Volume 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF units, they must complete applicable
46                                    AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


     requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF evaluations that expired during their tour.
     The restrictions in paragraph 5.2.14 of this instruction apply to such individuals until
     successful evaluations are completed.
NOTES:
     1. MAJCOMs may approve exceptions to requirements for returning aircrew members to
        complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if, after case-by-case
        review, they determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2
        MDS-Specific Volume 2 evaluations. Document such action with an MFR placed in
        Section II of the FEF on top of the non-USAF AF Form 8 equivalent.
        2. Air Force units that use non-US Air Force aircraft to execute an Air Force flying
           program will comply with current Air Force guidance, unless excepted by proper
           authority. See AFI 11-401 for definitions of Air Force and US Government aircraft.
     5.2.20. (Added-PACAF) Pyramid Evaluation Structure. Units will adhere to the
     pyramid evaluation structure to the maximum extent possible. This in no way shall interfere
     with leadership’s discretion to conduct evaluations on aircrews assigned/attached to their
     squadron:

5.3. Emergency Procedures Evaluations.
     5.3.1. Scope. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs and systems
     knowledge for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate MSN specific emergency procedures and
     systems knowledge during MSN evaluations. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for
     each combined evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN
     evaluation). A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
     INSTM/QUAL eval). The combined EPE must be of a scope and duration to cover required
     areas and must be within the requisite zone for each evaluation.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                 47


       5.3.1.1. (Added-PACAF) C-130 pilots who are ―assault only‖ mission qualified require
       only one EPE. Assault landing, takeoff procedures and maximum effort TOLD will be
       evaluated during this EPE.
   5.3.2. Satisfactory Performance. Satisfactory performance for EPEs requires taking the
   proper action in the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is
   responsible for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
   5.3.3. Content and Administration. AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 will specify
   contents of EPEs, grading areas to be evaluated, grading criteria and whether EPEs may be
   done inflight, in an ATD, or verbally.
   5.3.4. Grading. The flight examiner will assign an EPE grade 1, 2, or 3 (Qualification
   Level 1, 2, or 3) in the Qualification Ground Phase block of the AF Form 8/8a, regardless of
   whether all or a portion of the EPE was performed inflight.
   5.3.5. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight examiner
   will indicate if the additional training will be accomplished before next flight under
   restrictions in the Comments block of the AF Form 8/8a.
   5.3.6. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP situation during
   an EPE requires an unqualified (3) EPE grade. An aircrew member who receives a 3 grade as
   a result of Bold-face/CAPs error will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
   accomplished.
   5.3.7. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an unqualified EPE grade (3) will be
   placed on supervised status until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.
5.4. Supplementary Evaluations. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by
a commander to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to operational problems. These
evaluations are most often administered as inspections (using specifically prepared checklists)
where results are reported to the commander. The form and content of supplementary evaluations
is at the discretion of the commander.
   5.4.1. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.
   5.4.2. Commanders will determine evaluated areas. The stan/eval function will determine the
   method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative management of data collection, and
   will report results as directed by the commander.
       5.4.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Accomplish the following when a specific area is identified
       for a supplementary evaluation:
          5.4.2.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Outline the specific objectives of the evaluation and
          determine an adequate time frame to achieve the objectives.
          5.4.2.1.2. (Added-PACAF) Develop checklists to ensure standardization and
          minimize oversight.
          5.4.2.1.3. (Added-PACAF) For non-flying supplementary evaluations include a
          review of lesson plans, syllabi, training, tactics, etc.
          5.4.2.1.4. (Added-PACAF) Evaluate the results and determine discrepancies,
          recommended corrective action, suspense dates, and OPR for corrective action.
48                                AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


            5.4.2.1.5. (Added-PACAF) Report supplementary evaluation results to the
            appropriate OPR through the OG/CC. The report will include the objectives of the
            evaluation, the time frame during which it was performed, discrepancies that were
            noted, recommended corrective action and suspense dates for completion of
            corrective action.
            5.4.2.1.6. (Added-PACAF) Perform follow-up to ensure that completed corrective
            action is effective. The stan/eval function will recommend when the commander
            should close corrective action items.
            5.4.2.1.7. (Added-PACAF) Retain a copy of supplementary evaluation reports for
            at least 1 year.
     5.4.3. Individuals other than flight examiners, as determined by the OG/CC, may conduct
     supplementary evaluations.
     5.4.4. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight
     evaluation. If conducted in-flight, supplementary evaluations should not be all-
     encompassing, nor result in the assignment of an overall rating for any specific aircrew
     member, nor be documented on an AF Form 8/8a.
     5.4.5. Supplementary evaluation results will be documented in SEB minutes.
     5.4.6. (Added-3WG) Responsibilities:
        5.4.6.1. (Added-3WG) OGV will conduct supplementary evaluations as directed by the
        3 OG/CC. Duties permitting, OGV will conduct squadron-level supplementary
        evaluations at the request of the SQ/CC.
        5.4.6.2. (Added-3WG) Normally,      SQ/CCV         will    conduct SQ/CC-directed
        supplementary evaluations. Duties permitting, SQ/CCV personnel will assist with
        OG/CC-directed supplementary evaluations at the request of OGV.
        5.4.6.3. (Added-3WG) The SQ/CCV Chief will appoint a primary and alternate
        program manager for the squadron supplementary evaluations program.
     5.4.7. (Added-3WG) Program Management:
        5.4.7.1. (Added-3WG) The 3 OG/CC-directed supplementary evaluations will normally
        be administered to all OG flying squadrons in an effort to identify trends across the
        group.
        5.4.7.2. (Added-3WG) Specific areas, programs or topics will be evaluated based on
        PACAF’s Squadron Self-Inspection Checklists. Additionally, SEFEs will evaluate any
        OG ground training class they attend. The ground training critique can be found on the 3
        OGV webpage. Supplemental evaluations will be conducted by OGV quarterly as a
        minimum.
        5.4.7.3. (Added-3WG) Results will be reported via the monthly report to OGV. These
        reports will be maintained for a minimum of 1 year. Following a squadron-level
        supplementary evaluation, SQ/CCV will forward a copy of the report to OGV. OGV will
        maintain copies of all reports.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                 49


     5.4.7.4. (Added-3WG) OGV and SQ/CCV will maintain logs of all supplementary
     evaluations that track (as a minimum) the event or program evaluated, unit inspected,
     date of evaluation, examiner, grade, suspense date for corrective actions, date of follow-
     up evaluation and closeout date. The OGV log will contain entries for all supplementary
     evaluations conducted within the OG.
     5.4.7.5. (Added-3WG) Evaluators will accomplish a follow-up evaluation on any
     program graded less than satisfactory or any program requiring corrective actions. This
     evaluation will normally be conducted following the suspense date for corrective actions,
     unless all corrective actions are reconciled before the suspense. Prior to close out, the
     program must be graded to at least a satisfactory level with no remaining corrective
     actions.
     5.4.7.6. (Added-3WG) Evaluators will use the following definitions to grade
     supplemental evaluations:
         5.4.7.6.1. (Added-3WG) Outstanding: Programs/Procedures are error free and far
         exceed all requirements. Program execution serves as a model which others should
         emulate.
         5.4.7.6.2. (Added-3WG) Excellent: Programs/Procedures exceed requirements and
         enhance overall program effectiveness.
         5.4.7.6.3. (Added-3WG) Satisfactory:          Programs/Procedures met mission
         requirements. Procedures and activities are carried out in an effective and competent
         manner. Minor deficiencies may exist; however, they do not impede or limit program
         effectiveness or mission accomplishment.
         5.4.7.6.4. (Added-3WG) Marginal: Program/Procedures met most requirements,
         but are not in full compliance with directives. Performance and program
         effectiveness are degraded by deviations from procedures.
         5.4.7.6.5. (Added-3WG) Unsatisfactory: Major deviations or omissions from
         programs or procedures. Little compliance with appropriate directives is evident.
     5.4.7.7. (Added-3WG) Additional comments that may be used in inspection reports
     from supplemental evaluations:
         5.4.7.7.1. (Added-3WG) Strengths:       Used to specify superior unit procedures
         identified during the evaluations.
         5.4.7.7.2. (Added-3WG) Areas for Improvement: Used to identify procedures or
         non-compliance areas that may detract from mission performance or mission
         accomplishment.
         5.4.7.7.3. (Added-3WG) Findings: Used to identify deviations from published
         directives or activities that result in unsatisfactory performance. Corrective action
         must be identified, accomplished and reported in writing to 3 OG/OGV no later than
         30 days after receipt of the supplementary evaluation report. Findings will be re-
         inspected during subsequent supplementary evaluations.
  5.20.1. (Added-PACAF) OGV FEs may conduct evaluations in all squadrons flying
  aircraft/missions in which they are qualified. To increase objectivity and standardization
50                                 AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


     across the wing, whenever possible, squadron FEs should give checkrides in squadrons in
     which they are not primarily assigned/attached (exception: FTU student evaluations).
     5.20.2. (Added-PACAF) When no qualified examiner is available above the examinee in
     the pyramid evaluation structure or chain of command, the highest available evaluator will
     administer the evaluation.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                  51


                                          Chapter 6

                         AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written, computer-based
or electronic examinations. Poor testing performance on examinations indicates areas requiring
increased training emphasis.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, navigators, and air battle managers), career
enlisted aviator (CEA), and non-rated X-prefix AE aircrew. For Flight Surgeons (rated) and non-
rated aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code), see Chapter 8. The
examination program in this chapter includes requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and
unit periodic examinations. Requisite examinations include qualification open book and closed
book examinations, instrument examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in
paragraph 5.2.4 The ability to focus on specific knowledge areas is enhanced by the management
of examination content and use of appropriate master question files.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will describe the unit aircrew examination program
   in the unit supplement to this instruction.
       6.3.1.1. (Added-3WG) OGV will serve as the avenue for corrections to exams within
       PEX.
       6.3.1.2. (Added-3WG) The SQ/CCV Chief will appoint a primary and alternate
       program manager for the squadron examination program.
   6.3.2. Computer Based or Electronic Examinations. Computer based or electronic
   information management tools may fulfill the requirement for examinations as outlined in
   this instruction.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. The stan/eval function will retain graded exam
   answer sheets/computer records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
   6.3.4. Examination Question Review. The stan/eval function will review all MQFs, secure
   question banks, and prepared exams for accuracy annually and after any changes in source
   documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a source document change it may
   be annotated as the annual review. Units will document their procedures for reviewing and
   updating MQFs and prepared exams in their unit supplement to this instruction.
       6.3.4.1. (Added-3WG) OGV will solicit input from SQ/CCV when conducting annual
       reviews of applicable master question files (MQF), secure question banks (SQB), exam
       databases, and prepared exams. OGV will forward MQF discrepancies to lead command
       through PACAF/A3TV. Outdated/incorrect MQF questions will not be included on
       requisite exams.
       6.3.4.2. (Added-3WG) OGV review will be conducted in the first quarter of each
       calendar year or when a source document changes.
52                                 AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


     6.3.5. End-of-Course Examinations. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses
     listed in the Air Force Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) database
     (https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) examinations to fulfill the
     requirements of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite
     examinations.
        6.3.5.1. The stan/eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate
        with the MDS lead command to ensure the EOC examination meets the requirements of
        this instruction and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 before awarding credit for
        requisite completion.
        6.3.5.2. EOC examination test questions do not need to incorporate MAJCOM MQFs.
        All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures
        and not conflict with any MQFs.
        6.3.5.3. All EOC examinations that fulfill the requirements of requisite examinations will
        be graded according to paragraph 6.4.4.1 and entered on the AF Form 8 according to
        paragraph
6.4. Requisite Examinations. Aircrew members will complete open book, closed book and
Boldface/ CAPs examinations (if applicable) as requisites for periodic QUAL evaluations (see
paragraph 5.2.4.1), instrument examination as requisite for periodic INSTM evaluations (see
paragraph 5.2.4.2), and any other examinations required by the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-
Specific Volume 2 (see paragraph 5.2.4.3).
     6.4.1. Requisite Examination Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs
     examinations, maintain either requisite examinations for each crew position or generate a
     unique test for each aircrew member requiring an exam.
        6.4.1.1. If requisite examinations are maintained for each crew position:
            6.4.1.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two requisite
            examinations for each crew position.
            6.4.1.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one
            examination.
            6.4.1.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information,
            units are not required to maintain separate examinations for each crew position.
            6.4.1.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on requisite
            examinations each calendar year.
        6.4.1.2. If a unique test is generated for each aircrew member requiring an exam:
            6.4.1.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for test creation.
               6.4.1.2.1.1. (Added-3WG) Evaluation requisite testing will primarily be
               accomplished in PEX. In the event PEX is not available, contact OGV for
               alternate testing methods. Classified tests must be completed in an appropriately
               secure environment and may be computer or paper based tests.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                 53


         6.4.1.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain a sufficient number of questions to
         ensure a probability of no more than 50 percent duplication of questions for each test
         generated.
     6.4.1.3. (Added-PACAF) Unless specifically directed otherwise by AFI 11-2MDS Vol
     2, open and closed book exams will consist of a minimum of 40 questions.
     6.4.1.4. (Added-3WG) To the max extent possible, all requisite examinations should be
     completed by the end of the third month of eligibility, and prior to the flight portion of
     the evaluation.
     6.4.1.5. (Added-3WG) Questions may be contested following the exam with the
     squadron or OGV testing monitor; squadron testing monitors will forward all contested
     question to OGV for determination. If OGV finds reasonable cause during the question
     review, credit may be given and the question may be updated in the master question
     bank.
     6.4.1.6. (Added-3WG) Deployed Testing Procedures. Deploying personnel who will
     be in the zone should make every effort to complete all testing prior to deploying.
         6.4.1.6.1. (Added-3WG) Requisite examinations may be taken at deployed
         locations at the discretion of the squadron commander. The process and procedure
         for deployed requisite testing must be coordinated through and approved by OGV, the
         affected SQ/CCV, and the SQ/CC.
         6.4.1.6.2. (Added-3WG) CCV members may administer the squadron periodic
         examination while deployed. If no CCV personnel are available, the detachment
         commander (DETCO) may assign these duties at his or her discretion.
  6.4.2. Examination Security. Stan/eval personnel will maintain positive control of all
  requisite exams, applicable answer sheets and associated computer based/electronic media.
  EXCEPTION: Requisite Open-book Flight Surgeon examination will be maintained by
  AFMOA/SG3P.
     6.4.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Tests should be administered in designated testing location
     and monitored by stan/eval personnel.
         6.4.2.1.1. (Added-3WG) Tests may be administered by SQ/CCV personnel using
         squadron facilities and equipment or at 3 OG/OGV. SQ/CCV will designate, in
         writing, personnel authorized to administer testing and authorized testing locations.
            6.4.2.1.1.1. (Added-3WG) Due to limited facilities and manning, personnel
            wishing to test at OGV should call ahead to ensure testing is available prior to
            walking in.
     6.4.2.2. (Added-3WG) SQ/CCV will maintain positive control over all printed exams
     and answer sheets. When not in use, these materials will be stored in a secure location.
     If an exam is compromised, SQ/CCV will replace the exam immediately.
  6.4.3. Grading Policy For Examinations.
     6.4.3.1. Minimum Passing Grade. The minimum passing grade for Boldface/CAPs
     exams is 100 percent. The minimum passing grade for all other stan/eval requisite
     examinations is 85 percent - corrected to 100 percent.
54                                 AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


        6.4.3.2. Requisite and Boldface/CAPs Examination Grading Restriction. Units will
        grade all completed requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew member’s
        next flight. In the unit supplement to this instruction describe how this restriction is
        enforced.
        6.4.3.3. (Added-3WG) Any squadron flight examiner or standardization/evaluation
        liaison officers (SELO) may administer an exam for any crewmember, regardless of
        MDS; however, the exam will be graded by a FE and the results will be given to the
        crewmember’s standardization/ evaluation section for documentation. Incorrectly
        answered questions will be explained and entered into the trend analysis program by the
        crewmember’s standardization/evaluation section.
        6.4.3.4. (Added-3WG) The 3 OG/OGV will be the OPR for developing and
        maintaining all open book requisite examinations for all crew positions in every 3 WG
        MDS with the exception of the E-3 battle director technician (BDT). Unclassified open
        book examinations will not be developed for C-17 crewmembers as Boeing ® phase
        training CBTs satisfies open book exam requirements.
            6.4.3.4.1. (Added-3WG) The 962 AACS/CCV will be the OPR for BDT requisite
            examinations.
            6.4.3.4.2. (Added-3WG) All publications for unclassified open book testing are
            available on the stan/eval web page and will be accessible during testing. Paper
            copies may be used if available.
            6.4.3.4.3. (Added-3WG) Either electronic or paper copies of publications required
            for the classified portion of any test will be made available at the squadron testing
            facility.
            6.4.3.4.4. (Added-3WG) If not digitally available, paper copies of publications
            required for the instrument refresher course (IRC) test will be made available at any
            squadron or group testing facility.
     6.4.4. Examination Question Sources.
        6.4.4.1. Open Book Requisite Exam. Open book questions will come from
        publications containing information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and
        performance of the assigned mission. The open book subject areas and the publications
        used to generate the exam will be made available to aircrew. Each unit may develop an
        open book secure question bank (SQB) that serves as the source for some or all of the
        open book examination questions. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
        safeguard it in the same manner as any other required stan/eval examination. Electronic
        publications may be used for open book examinations.
        6.4.4.2. Closed Book Requisite Exams. Closed book questions will come from MQFs.
        These questions will emphasize system knowledge and information necessary for safe
        flight and mission accomplishment.
            6.4.4.2.1. MDS-Specific MQFs. Lead command MAJCOMs will ensure MDS-
            Specific MQFs containing approved questions for closed book testing are available
            for MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable aircrew.
               6.4.4.2.1.1. The highest organization with a stan/eval function (NAF or unit) may
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                  55


            develop, maintain and publish MQFs for weapons systems without MAJCOM
            expertise. That organization will submit these MQFs to the MAJCOM for
            approval prior to their publication.
            6.4.4.2.1.2. MAJCOM OPRs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes
            to MQFs as necessary.
                6.4.4.2.1.2.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures,
                administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational
                procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
                6.4.4.2.1.2.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate
                MAJCOM.
        6.4.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local
        procedures MQF databank to augment HHQ MQFs.
     6.4.4.3. Instrument Requisite Exams. Instrument test questions come from the
     Instrument MQF maintained by the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA). The
     selection and content of the questions is dictated by the provisions of AFMAN 11-210.
  6.4.5. Boldface/CAPs Requisite Examinations.
     6.4.5.1. Aircrew member knowledge of applicable Boldface/CAPs will be evaluated
     through a written examination as a requisite to all periodic QUAL evaluations.
        6.4.5.1.1. (Added-PACAF) For aircrew that have published Boldface/CAPs,
        include a separate Boldface/CAPs examination with closed book exams.
        Boldface/CAPs exams given in conjunction with an EPE may satisfy this
        requirement.
     6.4.5.2. Satisfactory performance for the Boldface/CAPs examination requires writing
     the proper actions in the correct sequence, not necessarily a verbatim response. The flight
     examiner will assign a Boldface/CAPs grade (Q or U) in the Qualification Ground Phase
     block of the AF Form 8/8a.
  6.4.6. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam. An evaluation will not be complete until all
  failed items have been successfully re-accomplished.
     6.4.6.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination at
     any time must be afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other
     than Boldface/CAPs, the aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
     6.4.6.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite examination
     must complete a successful reexamination by the end of the third month following the
     date of the first failure, or the end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first.
     Waiver authority to extend the time allowed to successfully complete the examination is
     the OG/CC. Document such waivers with an MFR placed in Section II of the FEF of the
     affected individual. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
     AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when
     action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a
     permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not
     addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
56                                  AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


        6.4.6.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
        Boldface/ CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful reexamination is
        accomplished.
        6.4.6.4. Supervised Status Requirement. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite
        open book, closed book, or instrument examination in supervised status until successful
        retesting is completed. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications,
        supervised status resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination
        applies only to the aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of a
        requisite instrument exam results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all
        aircraft in which instrument qualification is required.
        6.4.6.5. (Added-3WG) Personnel who fail an exam will not be re-tested the same day.
        Failure of any requisite examination will be reported immediately to the SQ/CC.
        SQ/CCV will inform SQ/DO, applicable Fight/CC, squadron training, squadron
        scheduling and ARMS of any crewmember not eligible to fly due to failure to pass an
        exam. Squadron CCV will ensure the appropriate grade is annotated in the individual’s
        AF Forms 8/8a. (Refer to the 3 OGV webpage for the Restrictions and Additional
        Training Sample Letter).
6.5. Unit Periodic Examinations (optional). Each group/squadron stan/eval function may
conduct periodic testing for all aircrew. The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional
knowledge beyond the scope of requisite exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge,
tactical/threat knowledge, and/or operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge
deficiencies exist within the unit. This exam may be open or closed book, but will not count as a
requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy the requirement for a periodic exam. Units will
describe this program in the unit supplement to this instruction, to include procedures for failed
exams.
     6.5.1. (Added-PACAF) Units will conduct semiannual testing. Test will consist of a
     minimum of 25 questions. Unit stan/eval should determine specific objectives prior to testing
     (MQF vs. non-MQF questions, inclusion of weapons or Intel questions, questions from past
     trends, etc.) Report the results (including percentage of aircrews tested) at the semi-annual
     SEB.
        6.5.1.1. (Added-3WG) SQ/CCV offices will accomplish semi-annual testing for all
        crew positions during the second and fourth quarters (calendar year).                  All
        assigned/attached combat ready mission/basic mission capable (CMR/BMC)
        crewmembers will test. Newly assigned crewmembers, and those returning to
        CMR/BMC status after a prolonged period of non-flying, will test in the current semi-
        annual period if they attain CMR/BMC status prior to 1 week before the end of the semi-
        annual period. Semi-annual tests may be open book tests. The minimum passing grade
        is 85%. A different test (at least half the questions changed) will be administered for all
        retests. Crewmembers will retest within 1 month after the date of the first failure or by
        the end of the half, whichever occurs first. Commanders will be notified if any
        crewmember receives a failing score. SQ/CCV will inform OGV/SQ CC/SQ DO of the
        names and scores of each individual who fails their semi-annual test.
     6.5.2. (Added-3WG) Each Squadron CCV will administer OGV approved semi-annual
     periodic exams for all crew positions.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                 57


       6.5.2.1. (Added-3WG) SQ/CCV will report testing results to OGV via monthly reports.
       Include questions missed and percentage of crewmembers answering each question
       incorrectly.
   6.5.3. (Added-3WG) Semi-annual periods are based upon the calendar year (that is, Jan-Jun
   and Jul-Dec).
   6.5.4. (Added-3WG) At least 25 percent of the periodic exam questions will be replaced
   each semi-annual period.
6.6. (Added-PACAF) All units will establish a Boldface/CAPs written examination program
for all applicable crew positions. As a minimum, all applicable aircrew members will
successfully complete a Boldface/CAPs written examination prior to the first flight of each
month. The examination will be taken in the month of or up to 7 days prior to the month for
which it is applicable.
   6.6.1. (Added-3WG) SQ/CCV will ensure that monthly Boldface exams are conducted for
   all applicable crewmembers.
   6.6.2. (Added-3WG) Boldface accomplishment will be documented in PEX.
   6.6.3. (Added-3WG) Crewmembers who depart on a mission that passes over the end of a
   month may continue to fly without accomplishing the current (new) month’s Boldface as
   long as they do not return to home station. In the event the crew returns to home station
   complete the Boldface prior to next home station departure. (EXAMPLE: A crew leaves on
   22 November with a 12-day -- scheduled return time (SRT) – each crewmember must
   complete their November boldface prior to home station launch, but are not required to do a
   December Boldface until they are put onto a subsequent mission or local after they return to
   home station from the current mission.)
   6.6.4. (Added-3WG) Failure to complete monthly Boldface. SQ/CCV will place any
   member who does not complete monthly Boldface in supervised status until the individual
   has successfully completed the monthly boldface missed.
   6.6.5. (Added-3WG) Boldface failures. Any member who fails monthly Boldface will be
   placed on supervised status until successful re-accomplishment. SQ/CCV will accomplish an
   Additional Training Letter using the example found on the 3 OGV webpage.

                                      DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications and authorizations for which an aircrew member is to be
evaluated are determined from the unit certification document. The results of aircrew evaluations
are recorded on the AF Form 8 or AF Form 8a, which certifies the qualification of the aircrew
member. The chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF
Form 942, Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF for the aircrew
member. EXCEPTION: Not required for cadets participating in USAFA airmanship programs.
7.2. Qualifications and Certifications. Aircrew qualifications are attained through evaluations
and documented on the AF Form 8 or the AF Form 8a, as applicable. Aircrew certifications
attained through methods other than evaluation (instructor-certified events and commander
certifications for example) may be documented on an AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air
Crew Training, or AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. As an alternative to use of AF
Form 1381 or AF Form 4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document
signed by an authorized official.
     7.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Units may use a ―Letter of Xs‖ as a unit certification document.
7.3. AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
     7.3.1. Purpose. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification. Certification of an AF
     Form 8 is accomplished by four individuals, beginning with the Flight Examiner, who
     completes the evaluation by signing the AF Form 8. Next, the Reviewing Officer and Final
     Approving Officer review the contents, the flight examiner’s overall assessment, ensure all
     required additional training was adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete,
     and sign the AF Form 8. The final signature is provided by the examinee, who will sign the
     completed AF Form 8. EXCEPTION: For a Commander-Directed Downgrade AF Form 8,
     only the commander signs as the Final Approving Officer. See paragraph 7.4.8
        7.3.1.1. Use a separate AF Form 8 for all flight phase rechecks.
        7.3.1.2. Ground rechecks will be completed on the original Q-3 AF Form 8 (see
        paragraph 7.3.9).
     7.3.2. General Data Entry. Use the following guidance when completing an AF Form 8.
     See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8.
        7.3.2.1. For date fields in the AF Form 8 use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-
        digit year format. For electronic forms, use the date format required by the form.
        7.3.2.2. The Eligibility Period and Expiration Date of Qualification will use a three-letter
        month and two-digit year format. For electronic forms, use the date format required by
        the form.
        7.3.2.3. Except for the organization of the Comments block described in paragraph 7.3.7,
        sample AF Forms 8 are provided to demonstrate the content, not the format, of the data
        presented (see Attachment 3).
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                 59


     7.3.2.4. To facilitate the entry of data on the form, except where specifically noted
     otherwise, use upper and lower case letters.
     7.3.2.5. Requirements for letter font, numbers of spaces for indentation and justification

         7.3.4.3.1. Enter the aircraft MDS in which the evaluation was given.
         7.3.4.3.2. Enter the examinee’s highest qualification reflecting the intention of the
         evaluation (e.g., IP, MP, MN, MF, MAWO, ISD, IAM, etc.) in that particular aircraft
         MDS. Note: Examiner is not a qualification, it is a certification, and should only be
         entered when demonstrated during the evaluation, i.e., a SPOT evaluation in which
         the examinee receives an evaluation while administering an evaluation.
     7.3.4.4. Eligibility Period.
         7.3.4.4.1. Enter the 6-month period preceding the expiration date from the last
         similar periodic aircrew qualification evaluation (e.g., if the last MSN evaluation

        examiner, type evaluation, qualification level, and date completed. List any discrepancies
        by area/subarea, any restrictions, any additional training and any additional training due
        dates. The examiner completing the evaluation will sign and date the certificate.
        Procedures concerning the temporary evaluation certificate will be outlined in the unit
        supplement.
           7.3.8.2.1. (Added-3WG) Temporary evaluation documentation or a draft AF Forms
           8/8a will be completed no later than 5 working days after the evaluation is completed
           and placed in Section II (right side) of the FEF. After all signatures have been
           obtained on the original AF Form 8, remove the evaluation documentation or draft
           AF Form 8 and insert the original AF Form 8 into Section II. Make the appropriate
           entry in the AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. If requisites have not been
           completed by the end of the flight portion of the evaluation, the evaluation is
           incomplete, and a draft copy of the AF Form 8 will be placed in the FEF pending
           completion.
        7.3.8.3. Remove the temporary evaluation certificate when the permanent AF Form 8 is
        filed in the FEF.
        7.3.8.4. File the completed AF Form 8 (all reviews/approvals accomplished) in the FEF
        not later than the end of the third month following the date completed on the AF Form 8.
           7.3.8.4.1. (Added-3WG) Do not withhold filing an AF Form 8 while awaiting
           additional training. If AF Form 8 signatures are completed outside of this window,
           annotate as a minor discrepancy.
     7.3.9. Ground Rechecks.
        7.3.9.1. Ground rechecks are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of an
        unqualified evaluation when the flight examiner deems a flight recheck unnecessary.
        7.3.9.2. The ground recheck will be documented on the original AF Form 8 generated to
        document the Q-3 flight evaluation.
        7.3.9.3. To document the ground recheck, follow instructions in paragraphs 7.3.3
        through 7.3.6, except as noted below:
           7.3.9.3.1. Date Completed. Use the latest completion date (ground phase or
           successful ground recheck) of the evaluation.
           7.3.9.3.2. Flight Phase. Document the date of the ground recheck on a separate line
           as ―GROUND RECHECK‖ below the flight evaluation entry under Flight Phase.

   7.4.1. Purpose. Use the AF Form 8a to record aircrew qualification in multiple aircraft as
   demonstrated in required ground and flight evaluations. Certification of an AF Form 8a is
   accomplished by four individuals, beginning with the Flight Examiner, who completes the
   evaluation by signing the AF Form 8a. Next, the Reviewing Officer and Final Approving
   Officer review the contents, the flight examiner’s overall assessment, ensure all required
   additional training was adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete, and sign
   the AF Form 8a. The final signature is provided by the examinee, who will sign the
   completed AF Form 8a. Certification will not occur until all requisites of all aircraft for
   which the aircrew member possesses an aircraft AO are complete. EXCEPTIONS: Flight
   Surgeons and non-rated aircrew with only a ground phase examination do not require a
   Reviewing Officer’s signature, IAW paragraph 7.4.6.2 For a Commander-Directed
   Downgrade AF Form 8a, only the commander signs as the Final Approving Officer. See

         Comments/Examiner’s Remarks.
7.5. Commander-Directed Downgrade.
   7.5.1. Purpose. Any commander (squadron/detachment or above) in the aircrew member’s
   chain of command may direct a downgrade to an intermediate level of
   qualification/certification or unqualified/decertified status without administering an
   evaluation under the following guidance:
      7.5.1.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only, e.g., breach of flying discipline or
      flight safety - including incidents not observed by an examiner, or observed, but by an
      examiner of another aircrew specialty.
      7.5.1.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
      administrative or judicial actions. Use in cases where such actions directly affect the
      commander’s confidence in the aircrew member’s flying or performance ability to safely
      operate the aircraft and/or equipment.

7.6. AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training. Optional. If used, comply
with the following guidance when completing an AF Form 1381. MAJCOMs may prescribe use
of AF Form 1381 or AF Form 4348 (see paragraph 7.7). If prescribed, use either form. See
Attachment 6 for sample AF Form 1381.
   7.6.1. Purpose. The AF Form 1381 provides a permanent record/certification source for
   aircrew certifications not attained through an AF Form 8/8a qualification. (MAJCOMs may
   approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized official. An authorized
   official for a unit certification document will be an official authorized to approve an AF
   Form 8 or 8a, or another appropriate authority designated in writing by this official.)
82                              AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


     7.6.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 1381 in the FEF, Section I, documenting
     certifications by individual assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew members
     with multiple aircraft certifications attained through difference training, only one AF
     Form 1381 is required; specify the primary mission MDS designation. File AF Forms
     1381 in chronological order with the most recent on top. Note: May also be filed in an
     aircrew member’s permanent training folder, as a training completion document. When
     AF Form 1381 is used as a training completion document, refer to AFI 11-202, Volume
     1, for guidance.
     7.6.1.2. Unit stan/eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
     aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
     certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
        7.6.1.2.1. The AF Form 1381 will document all certifications attained in previous
        and current MDS(s). Retain as a historical source document. File AF Forms 1381 in
        chronological order with the most recent on top.
        7.6.1.2.2. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review AF Form 1381
        entries in the aircrew member’s training folder to determine applicable certifications
        of new assigned/ attached aircrew members. Document aircrew certifications as
        specified by the assigned/ attached flying unit commander on a new AF Form 1381.
            7.6.1.2.2.1. The OGV/DOV Chief or other individual designated by the squadron
            commander will sign a one line entry below all other entries signifying acceptance
            of those events listed above (see paragraph 7.6.7 for documentation
            requirements).
        7.6.1.2.3. AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF Form 1381
        certifying officials, IAW paragraph 7.6.3.4
            7.6.1.2.3.1. (Added-PACAF) HQ PACAF/A3TV approves the use of a unit
            certification document signed by an authorized official (such as a Letter of X’s) in
            lieu of an AF Form 1381. An authorized official for a unit certification document
            or AF Form 1381 will be an official authorized to approve an AF Form 8 or 8a, or
            another appropriate authority designated in writing by this official.
        7.6.1.2.4. (Added-PACAF) When differences between series aircraft in the same
        MDS are great enough (ex: KC-135A to KC-135R), the lead MAJCOM (ex: AMC),
        in coordination with using MAJCOMs (ex: PACAF), will identify requirements for
        separate qualification requirements. When separate qualification is not required (ex:
        KC-135R Block 30 to KC-135R Block 40), document certification in different MDS
        series using AF Form 1381 or unit certification document.
     7.6.1.3. Do not use AF Form 1381 to document one-time training/new equipment unless
     directed by HHQ.
     7.6.1.4. Appropriate guidance that may require aircrew certification using AF Form 1381
     entry include AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement; AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
     Volume 1; AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 3, MDS XX - Operations Procedures;
     CONOPS; HHQ messages; and local unit guidance.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                    83


     7.6.1.5. MAJCOMs supplements may specify procedures or sources for preparing AF
     Forms 1381.
         7.6.1.5.1. (Added-PACAF) The AF Form 1381 provides a permanent
         record/certification source for aircrew certifications not attained through an AF Form
         8/8a qualification. A completed AF Form 4022 (specific to required training) which
         includes AF Forms 4023, 4024, 4025, training guides, and additional information
         (waivers, etc.) will be used as source documentation for AF Form 1381. Refer to
         AFI11-2-MDSV1 for guidance on form completion.
  7.6.2. General Data Entry.
     7.6.2.1. Complete individual identification block with last name, first name, middle
     initial, any titles (e.g., Jr. or II) and last four of SSAN.
     7.6.2.2. Use one line for each certification or decertification.
     7.6.2.3. Enter each certification or decertification in chronological order base on the date
     the action is completed.
     7.6.2.4. For date fields in the AF Form 1381, use a two-digit day, three-letter month and
     two-digit year format (e.g., 20 Dec 05), or as required by electronic form (20051220).
  7.6.3. Certification.
     7.6.3.1. (DELETE.)
     7.6.3.2. Subject Title. Enter each certification title on the AF Form 1381.
     7.6.3.3. Date Certified. Enter the effective date of certification.
         7.6.3.3.1. For certifications attained as part of a FTU, the date will match the date of
         the applicable AF Form 8/8a, or enter the date of completion or graduation from FTU
         if no AF Form 8/ 8a is issued.
     7.6.3.4. Certification Official/Organization. The Certifying Official will sign above their
     typed name, rank, organization and office symbol.
     7.6.3.5. The Certifying Official is the person authorized by governing directives to
     approve or certify an aircrew member for a specific position or event.
     7.6.3.6. If a certification is given with restrictions, state the restrictions on the AF Form
     1381. Use additional lines on the AF Form 1381, as necessary.
  7.6.4. Decertification. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for
  Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
     7.6.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
         7.6.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
         but also apples to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
         substandard performance).
         7.6.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, line out the event, date and
         certifying official/organization/location; annotate ―Decertification for Cause‖ under
         Training Requirement/ Subject Title; enter date of decertification under Date
84                                 AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


            Completed; enter name, rank, organization, and office symbol and signature of
            decertifying official under Certifying Official/Organization.
        7.6.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
        performance.
            7.6.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
            occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1, when
            instructor certified events become core mission events, or when a higher certification
            is obtained making the previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also
            applicable for decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than
            substandard performance.
            7.6.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification: line out the event, date and
            certifying official/organization/location; annotate ―Discretionary Decertification‖
            under Training Requirement/Subject Title; enter date of decertification under Date
            Completed; enter name, rank, organization and office symbol of the decertifying
            official under Certifying Official/ Organization. Note: For decertification due to loss
            of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the effective date of
            decertification will be the date of certification loss.
            7.6.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
            Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: line out the event, date and
            certifying official/ organization/location; annotate ―Renamed (new name)‖ under
            Subject Title.
            7.6.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
            stan/eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 1381 indicating the new MDS and
            transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.6.1.2.2
     7.6.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional

7.7. AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. Optional. Use in place of AF Form 1831
when used. If used, comply with the following guidance when completing an AF Form 4348. See
Attachment 7 for sample AF Forms 4348.
   7.7.1. Purpose. The AF Form 4348 provides a permanent record and certification source for
   aircrew certifications not attained through an AF Form 8/8a qualification.
       7.7.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 4348 in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1
       documenting certifications by assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew
       members with aircraft certifications in multiple MDS aircraft which do not require
       qualification in each aircraft (i.e. F-16C and F-16CG), only one AF Form 4348 is
       required; specify the primary mission MDS designation. File AF Forms 4348 in
       chronological order with the most recent on top.
       7.7.1.2. Unit stan/eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
       aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
       certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
          7.7.1.2.1. The AF Form 4348 will document all certifications attained in previous
          and current MDS(s). Retain in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1, as a historical source
          document. File AF Forms 4348 in chronological order with the most recent on top.
          7.7.1.2.2. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review previous AF Form
          4348 entries to determine all applicable certifications of new assigned/attached
          aircrew member. Then, document applicable aircrew certifications accepted by the
          gaining flying unit commander on a new AF Form 4348.
              7.7.1.2.2.1. The OGV/DOV Chief or other individual designated by the squadron
              commander will sign a one line entry below all other entries verifying that above
              certification transcriptions are accurate (see paragraph 7.7.7 for documentation
              requirements).
          7.7.1.2.3. AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF Form 4348
          certifying officials, IAW paragraph 7.7.3.4
       7.7.1.3. Do not use AF Form 4348 to document one-time training/new equipment unless
       directed by HHQ.
       7.7.1.4. Appropriate guidance that may require aircrew certification using AF Form 4348
       entry include AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement; AFI 11-2 MDS Specific,
       Volume 1; AFI 11-2 MDS Specific, Volume 3; CONOPS; HHQ messages; and local unit
       guidance.
       7.7.1.5. MAJCOMs supplements will specify procedures or sources for preparing AF
       Forms 4348.
   7.7.2. General Data Entry.
       7.7.2.1. Complete individual identification block with last name, first name, middle
       initial, any titles (e.g., Jr. or II), last four of SSAN, unit MDS and unit
       organization/location.

        approve or certify an aircrew member for a specific position or event.
        7.7.3.6. If a certification is given with restrictions, state the restrictions on the AF Form
        4348 in the Remarks block.
     7.7.4. Decertification. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for
     Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
        7.7.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
            7.7.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
            but also apples to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
            substandard performance).
            7.7.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, place an ―X‖ in the appropriate

        7.7.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
        performance.
            7.7.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
            occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1, when
            instructor certified events become core mission events, or when a higher certification
            is obtained making the previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also
            applicable for decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than
            substandard performance.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                    87


          7.7.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification, place an ―X‖ in the appropriate
          box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
          organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
          Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7. Note: For
          decertification due to loss of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the
          effective date of decertification will be the date of certification loss.
          7.7.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
          Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: annotate ―Renamed (new
          title)‖ under Remarks.
          7.7.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
          stan/eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 4348 indicating the new MDS and
          transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.7.1.2.2
   7.7.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional
   information for an AF Form 4348 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the
   AF Form 4348.
   7.7.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 4348. Units may use a computer-generated AF
   Form 4348 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
   maintained. Computer-generated AF forms must mirror AF forms published on the Air Force
   e-Publishing web site.
      7.7.6.1. A computer-generated AF Form 4348 must be signed IAW paragraphs

         Individuals who maintain qualification in two or more mission design aircraft or two
         or more crew positions in the same mission design aircraft will file AF Forms 8/8a in
         chronological order – without consideration of MDS or crew position.
         7.9.2.2.2. Memos for record documenting waivers and extensions are filed on top of
         the affected AF Form 8/8a. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto
         the affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional
         Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Permanent
90                                    AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


            MFRs documenting major discrepancies relating to qualification (see paragraph
            7.8.5.1.1) are filed immediately above the latest affected AF Form 8/8a or, in cases
            where the memo is for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a, in
            chronological order with AF Forms 8/8a. Memos for record become a permanent part
            of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed
            or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
            7.9.2.2.3. Memos for record documenting major discrepancies of a particular AF
            Form 8/8a will be filed on top of that AF Form 8/8a regardless of date the
            discrepancy is discovered.
            7.9.2.2.4. Memos for record documenting similar discrepancies found on multiple
            AF Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.
            7.9.2.2.5. Copies of these source documents may be filed with other unit agencies for
            evaluation program management.
     7.9.3. Description of Folders.
        7.9.3.1. Folders must be letter size, able to separate contents into two sections and
        constructed of heavy stock (recommend press board folder or equivalent).
        7.9.3.2. Standard 2 ¾-inch metal fasteners may be used.
        7.9.3.3. Affix a label bearing the individual’s name and last four of SSAN to the inside
        back cover so that the folder may be identified when filed. Include additional information
        on the label if required.
        7.9.3.4. Folders must bear the ―Privacy Act‖ statement or a ―For Official Use Only‖
        label/stamp on both sides of the FEF folder.
     7.9.4. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
     and how to implement the annual review of FEFs in the unit supplement to this instruction.
        7.9.4.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
        aircrew members to establish their currency and qualification prior to their first flight.
            7.9.4.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the currency and
            qualification of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable
            documentation in Sections I and II of the FEF. Following determination of the
            currency and qualification of the aircrew member, the unit maintaining the FEF is
            responsible only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
            7.9.4.1.2. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
            stan/eval function at their assigned stations, that stan/eval function will also review
            the FEF prior to their first flight.
            7.9.4.1.3. (Added-PACAF) Document initial reviews with a one-line entry on the
            AF Form 942. Annotate ―Initial Review‖ in the Type of Evaluation block and the date
            conducted in the Date Completed block.
        7.9.4.2. Posting Review. The stan/eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a, AF
        Form 1381, or AF Form 4348 when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and
        completeness. This review will confirm that the eligibility period and qualification as
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                 91


     documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events were accomplished and
     requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that the AF Form 8/8a
     contains all signatures and initials within allotted time. AF Forms 1381/4348 will be
     reviewed for correct certification signature and to ensure all previous entries are
     accounted for and are accurate. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM
     supplement.
     7.9.4.3. Periodic Review. The stan/eval function will review all unit FEFs to confirm
     expiration dates used to track required aircrew qualification evaluations are the same as
     those listed in the FEFs. The interval between reviews will not exceed the qualification
     period window established by paragraph 5.2.6.1 unless a more restrictive review period is
     established by the MAJCOM supplement. Document the periodic review IAW unit or
     MAJCOM supplement. Periodic review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is not
     required.
        7.9.4.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Document annual reviews with a one-line entry on the
        AF Form 942. Annotate ―Annual Review‖ in the Type of Evaluation block and the

  Form 1381, AF Form 4348, and AF Form 942.
     7.9.5.1. Categories of Discrepancies. Discrepancies are categorized by their impact on
     qualification/certification.
        7.9.5.1.1. Discrepancies that alter the qualification/certification of the affected
        aircrew member are considered major.
        7.9.5.1.2. Those discrepancies that do not alter the qualification/certification of the
        affected aircrew member are considered minor and include typos, formatting and
        misspellings.
     7.9.5.2. Major Discrepancies Disposition. Identified major discrepancies are
     documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section I or II immediately above the affected
     AF Form 8/8a/1381/4348, or in chronological order with the AF Forms 8/8a/1381/4348
     for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a/1381/4348. An MFR created to
     document late evaluations, OG/CC waivers, etc. is removed from the FEF once the
     information is incorporated onto the completed affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner
     Remarks paragraph D, Additional Comments. Memos for record become a permanent

does not apply to X-prefix Aeromedical Evacuation crewmembers.
8.2. Flight Surgeon.
     8.2.1. Flight Surgeon Qualification. Basic initial and periodic flight surgeon qualification
     consists of an open-book examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion
     of the basic examination, flight surgeons will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal
     qualification). MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and MDS-
     Specific flight surgeon requirements. Qualification requirements will be documented on AF
     Form 8/8a. Certification requirements will be documented on AF Forms 1381/4348.
     Qualification and certification, when required, must be accomplished before flight as an
     aircrew member.
     8.2.2. Evaluations. Flight surgeon initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required)
     examinations are considered QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this
     AFI, but may be prescribed in MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
     8.2.3. Timing of Flight Surgeon Evaluations.
        8.2.3.1. Expiration Date. The required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the
        17th month following the month in which the date of the AF Form 8/8a was successfully
        completed.
        8.2.3.2. Scheduling. Schedule the periodic evaluation in the eligibility period (6-month
        period prior to expiration date).
        8.2.3.3. Extended Evaluations. The OG/CC may extend the expiration date of the Flight
        Surgeon periodic evaluation up to three months on a case-by-case basis. Inform
        AFMSA/SGPA. Document extended evaluations IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.4
     8.2.4. Requisite Completion. MAJCOMs may establish requisites for flight surgeons as
     necessary. Requisites from a completed evaluation or an examination used for re-currency
     will not be used for subsequent evaluations. All requisites for scheduled periodic evaluations
     in the eligibility period must be completed within the 6-month eligibility period prior to the
     expiration date of the current evaluation period to update that expiration date.
     8.2.5. Grading Policies. An overall qualification level of Q-1 will be awarded upon the
     successful completion of the flight surgeon examination(s).
     8.2.6. Flight Surgeon Failure to Complete an Evaluation Within the Required
     Period. If a flight surgeon fails to complete an evaluation prior to the qualification
     expiration date, the flight surgeon loses the qualification covered by the evaluation. The
     flight surgeon will not fly as a crew member until successful completion of the delinquent
     evaluation.

                                ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS

9.1. Flight Crew Information File. Units will establish and maintain a library consisting of a
current read file and publications. This library will consist of a minimum of four volumes as
listed in Table 9.1 in either hardcopy or electronic format.
   9.1.1. Required Volumes. Volume I is a table of contents for all volumes and current read
   file items, Volumes II through IV are made up of publications and flight manuals, and
   Volume V (optional) is reserved for flight safety information. If units choose hardcopy
   format and the contents of any volume exceed the capacity of its binder, use an additional
   binder and identify the first and subsequent binders by a letter of sequence (e.g., IIIA, IIIB).
   Label binders on the spine indicating Volume and Title as follows:

Table 9.1. Required Volumes.
VOLUME                     TITLE
VOLUME I                   Table of Contents/Current Read File
VOLUME II                  Publications—Air Force Directives MAJCOM Supplements
VOLUME III                 Publications—MAJCOM/NAF/Local Directives
VOLUME IV                  Flight Manuals/Checklists/Aircrew Aids/Technical Orders
VOLUME V                   Flight Safety Information (Optional)
       9.1.1.1. (Added-PACAF) The unit Stan/Eval organization is the OPR for any
       information to be entered into FCIF Volumes I - IV. Limit entries to those items with a
       direct bearing on immediate flight requirements.
       9.1.1.2. (Added-PACAF) NAFs generating Volume I FCIF items and/or SIIs should
       coordinate with their units’ OGV prior to publication for the purpose of the units’ OGV
       providing stan/eval expertise. NAFs will forward a copy of all Volume I FCIF items and
       SIIs to HQ PACAF/A3TV.
   9.1.2. Current Read File. Volume I consists of a minimum of two parts to include an Index
   (Part A) and Current Read Files (Parts B and C (Note: Part C is optional)). MAJCOMs may
   add additional components to Volume I as appropriate.
       9.1.2.1. Part A is a table of contents listing all material contained in FCIF Volumes I
       through V.
       9.1.2.2. Part B is the Current Read File of FCIF messages. Messages contain information
       temporary in nature, directly pertinent to the safe conduct of flight, and must be read
       before flight.
          9.1.2.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Part B may also contain information designated by the
          MAJCOM/A3 or OG commander as required to be read before flight. Lengthy
          documents should be summarized or salient points highlighted to avoid
          overwhelming aircrews.
          9.1.2.2.2. (Added-3WG) These items will be considered Go/No-Go information and
          the OPR for inputs to Part B is 3 OG/OGV. Squadrons may submit proposals for
102                               AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


         inputs to 3 OG/OGV in draft form. Final approval authority for inputs is the 3
         OG/CC, or designated representative. Part B will contain a numerical index of
         current and rescinded Part B FCIF items as well as all current Part B FCIFs.
      9.1.2.3. Part C is the Current Read File that contains information temporary in nature but
      not related to the safe conduct of flight and not required to be read before flight. Part C is
      optional.
         9.1.2.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Part C, General Read File will be used for publication
         changes, policy notices, etc. Lengthy documents should be summarized or salient
         points highlighted to avoid overwhelming aircrews. Use Part C to provide current
         operations guidance that is neither critical nor required to be read before flight.
         9.1.2.3.2. (Added-3WG) Part C will contain a numerical index of current and
         rescinded Part C items as well as all current Part C CRFs.
      9.1.2.4. Squadrons with both primary crewmembers and mission crewmembers may use
      separate sections in Volume I for mission crewmembers. In addition, these squadrons are
      exempt from the requirement to maintain mission crewmember checklist and aircrew aids
      in the FCIF volumes.
      9.1.2.5. Refer to Attachment 8 for a sample message format for use when issuing an
      FCIF item from a MAJCOM/NAF stan/eval organization.
      9.1.2.6. (Added-PACAF) Part D (optional) is reserved for the Flight Crew Bulletin
      (FCB). At the OG/CC’s discretion, a FCB may be used to ensure vital aircrew
      information, not otherwise immediately accessible by aircrews, is published and updated.
      Maintain a current copy of the unit FCB in Part D.
         9.1.2.6.1. (Added-PACAF) OGV manages the FCB process if utilized. Review,
         publish, and consolidate FCBs quarterly. Active duty host units will coordinate FCBs
         with their guard/ reserve associate units as applicable. The FCB will include Official
         Memorandum indicating crewmember applicability. The memorandum will be signed
         by the OGV Chief and approved by the OG/CC (or equivalent) and (if applicable)
         guard/reserve associate OG/CC (or equivalent).
         9.1.2.6.2. (Added-3WG) Squadrons may request MDS-specific Flight Crew
         Bulletins (FCBs) through OGV.
      9.1.2.7. (Added-PACAF) Part B and C Admin.
         9.1.2.7.1. (Added-PACAF) Annotate Part B and Part C FCIF items with, as a
         minimum, an approved date, a control number, subject, originator and originator title,
         expiration date, and suspense date (review date) and a cross-reference of classified
         items (if used). Note: the subject should match the MAJCOM FCIF subject, when
         applicable. The NoGo box will be checked for all Part B items. Units will review
         items for applicability in conjunction with the PACAF quarterly message.
         9.1.2.7.2. (Added-PACAF) Part B and Part C will each consist of a numerical index
         of current FCIF items, a numerical index of rescinded FCIF items, and FCIF items
         filed in reverse numerical sequence with the last item on top.
         9.1.2.7.3. (Added-PACAF) Part B and C indexes may be combined.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                              103


        9.1.2.7.4. (Added-PACAF) Part B and C indexes will contain at a minimum the
        following information: subject, control number, and suspense date (review date).
        9.1.2.7.5. (Added-PACAF) List the subject, control number, expiration date, and
        disposition in the rescinded FCIF index. Remove from index at the end of the quarter
        following the quarter of rescission. OGV will maintain rescinded items in a separate
        file for at least 6 months. Electronic copies are adequate.
        9.1.2.7.6. (Added-3WG) 3 OG/OGV will disseminate Volume I, Part B FCIF and
        Part C crew read file (CRF) items via the 3 OGV web page. In addition, an e-mail
        will be sent to each affected SQ/CCV and Aviation Resources Management function
        (if required). SQ/CCV will notify OGV when the FCIF/CRF is received.
            9.1.2.7.6.1. (Added-3WG) The 3 OG/OGV will update the applicable index
            with each new FCIF/CRF item. The SQ/CCV will print and post the new index in
            the FCIF/CRF binder. Each FCIF/CRF will be numbered sequentially. Since all
            FCIFs/CRFs will not apply to all MDSs, the index will indicate the applicable
            FCIF/CRF items for each MDS. Each squadron will maintain only those items
            that apply to their MDS.
        9.1.2.7.7. (Added-3WG) The 3 OG/OGV will release all Technical Orders,
        Operational Supplements, and USAF/MAJCOM instructions and manuals related to
        flying activities via FCIF, Volume I, Part C, the CRF, unless specified otherwise by
        the releasing authority or OG/CC. Urgent changes or Safety Supplements may be
        posted via FCIF, Volume I, Part B, FCIF. All technical order, operational/safety
        supplements, AF/MAJCOM instructions and manuals related to flying activities are
        affected by this policy. Squadrons will not distribute instructions or publications
        prior to release by 3 OG/OGV. This policy does not affect the distribution/release of
        DOD FLIP.
        9.1.2.7.8. (Added-3WG) Squadron CCVs will forward urgent messages, publication
        changes and safety supplements to the Elmendorf Command Post for distribution to
        their deployed/temporary duty (TDY) crews.
     9.1.2.8. (Added-3WG) The 3 OG/OGV, the OPR for the FCIF program, will ensure all
     FCIF messages are routed and distributed to SQ/CCV as applicable to individual MDS.
     9.1.2.9. (Added-3WG) SQ/CCV will manage the FCIF program at squadron level. The
     SQ/CCV Chief will appoint a primary and alternate program manager for the squadron
     FCIF program.
     9.1.2.10. (Added-3WG) All FCIF Part B messages will be coordinated through the 3
     OG/CC (176 OG/CC if C-17 related) prior to release. FCIF Part C messages will be
     coordinated through OGV.
     9.1.2.11. (Added-3WG) Off-station aircrews will check the 3 OG/OGV website or
     EPEX ® (if available) for updated Part B FCIFs prior to departure of their next mission.
     If internet connectivity is unavailable, aircraft commanders will contact the Elmendorf
     Command Post for FCIF updates.

      9.1.3.5. (Added-3WG) If paper copies of the FCIF library are maintained, separate each
      publication in Volumes II – V with a divider marked with the publication number and
      title. For example, ―AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.‖ Each required publication will
      have a divider, even if the actual publication is missing or non-current. Arrange
      publications in the same order shown in the Table of Contents. If a publication is
      missing, or incomplete, insert a MFR in the binder behind the divider for the publication.
      The squadron FCIF Monitor or Chief of CCV will sign the MFR identifying the
      missing/incomplete/non-current publication, the status (on order, and so forth), a
      projected ―get well date,‖ and any follow-ups done. Publications maintained in squadron
      FCIFs must be in good condition.
      9.1.3.6. (Added-3WG) If a publication will be maintained in a location other than the
      squadron FCIF library, insert an MFR behind the divider for each affected publication,
      stating where the publication is stored.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                    107


       9.1.3.7. (Added-3WG) To reduce the workload involved with maintaining the Squadron
       Master FCIF Publications Library, 3 OGV has developed an electronic publications (E-
       Pubs) database that is located on the 3 OGV web page.
       9.1.3.8. (Added-3WG) At the SC/CC’s discretion, all Vol. II and non-MDS specific
       Vol. III publications are permitted to be kept in electronic format only (not required to be
       kept in hard copy) if the following conditions are met (EXCEPTION: The 517th AS
       will maintain all volumes of the FCIF Publications Library electronically):
          9.1.3.8.1. (Added-3WG) A computer will be made available that is dedicated to the
          use of the E-Pubs database. The computer must have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed
          and have an E-Pub shortcut on the desktop.
          9.1.3.8.2. (Added-3WG) In addition to 3 OGV E-Pubs database, required
          publications must be saved on external media (computer disk (CD), thumb drive,
          external hard drive, and so forth) to be used should the 3 OGV database not be
          accessible. These media must be controlled in the same way as the Master
          Publications File (that is, they will be signed out if they are removed from the
          library). Due to problems associated with keeping the database current, copies of the
          database should not be distributed beyond the Publications Library.
          9.1.3.8.3. (Added-3WG) Squadrons put a MFR in the front of Vol. II and Vol. III
          stating which publications in each volume are maintained electronically.
          (EXCEPTION: The 517th AS will have a single binder with the FCIF Library Index
          and a memo describing how the electronic FCIF library can be accessed.)
          9.1.3.8.4. (Added-3WG) The following publications will be kept in hard copy in the
          squadron publications library (N/A for 517th AS):
              9.1.3.8.4.1. (Added-3WG) 11-MDS Specific Volumes 1, 2, and 3.
              9.1.3.8.4.2. (Added-3WG) All required TOs, Checklists, and In-flight Guides.
              Minimum one copy per crew position.
              9.1.3.8.4.3. (Added-3WG) Any other required publications the squadron
              commander directs.
9.2. Flight Related Special Interest Item (SII).
   9.2.1. Flight Related SIIs are items of emphasis of existing procedure(s) designed to mitigate
   or eliminate specific risks or trends. SIIs do not add to or amend established procedures. SIIs
   will be based on analysis of risks and trends from a variety of sources to include Safety
   Investigation Board (SIB) findings/recommendations, safety related incidences, trend
   analysis, deployed area of operations and potential problems with equipment/procedures.
   9.2.2. SII(s) should normally be of limited duration (i.e. not to exceed 90 days) so as to
   maintain the focus. If the situation for which the SII was issued remains, consideration
   should be given to amending current procedures and issuing corrective action via a command
   message or FCIF.
   9.2.3. SII(s) may be issued/rescinded from the MAJCOM, NAF or unit level.
   9.2.4. MAJCOM/NAF SII(s) will be issued to applicable unit OGVs in a message format
   identifying the following elements: subject/title, unique DTG, specific MDS applicability,
108                                AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


   references (document, SIB, etc) risk and trend details, specific emphasis actions to
   reduce/eliminate the risk or trend that is the SII topic, effective date of rescission, and
   SME/POC for further information.
   9.2.5. Units will place all MAJCOM/NAF issued SIIs into the FCIF, Current Read File, Part
   B, for dissemination to crewmembers.
   9.2.6. All current flight-related MDS-Specific and CRM/ORM related SII(s) will be briefed
   during flight briefings for the duration of the SII(s). Mission related SII(s) need only be
   briefed on those missions for which the SII is relevant.
       9.2.6.1. (Added-3WG) Units will post higher headquarters (HHQ) and OG SIIs in
       mission planning rooms for ease of access during mission briefings. SIIs will be
       displayed prominently.
   9.2.7. Current MAJCOM/NAF and unit issued SII(s) will be identified in Flight Crew
   Information Summary (FCIS) attachments. Units that do not publish a FCIS will maintain
   current SII(s) in Part B of their FCIF until rescinded.
   9.2.8. (Added-3WG) Special Interest Item (SII) Program. The 3 OG/OGV will serve as
   OPR. Proposed group SIIs will be approved by the 3 OG/CC. Once approved, Group SIIs
   will be published via FCIF and posted on the OGV web page. SQ/CCs may develop
   squadron SIIs independent of the group program. Squadron SIIs will be posted via squadron
   read file (SRF) in Volume I, Section D of the FCIF. CCV will notify 3 OG/OGV of any
   squadron level SIIs. Aircrews will emphasize all SIIs during daily mission briefs, flights, and
   debriefs until rescinded.
9.3. Go/No-Go Procedures. Units will establish a positive control system that ensures aircrew
members have completed all ground training and stan/eval items required for flight.
   9.3.1. As a minimum, the Go/No Go system will monitor:
       9.3.1.1. The training items from AFI 11-202, Volume 1, required for flight.
       9.3.1.2. The ground training items required for flight from the applicable AFI 11-2
       MDS-Specific Volume 1.
       9.3.1.3. The aircrew physical, physiological training, centrifuge training, egress training,
       and current Aeronautical Order items IAW AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management.

       2/MAJCOM Supplement.
          9.3.1.4.1. (Added-PACAF) All applicable aircrew members will successfully
          complete a Boldface/CAPs written examination prior to the first home station flight
          of each month. The examination will be taken in the month of or up to 7 days prior to
          the month for which it is applicable.
              9.3.1.4.1.1. (Added-3WG) SQ CCV or OGV (if taken at OGV) will inform
              appropriate supervisor and DO of any testing failures. Any crewmember that fails
              a monthly Boldface/critical action procedures (CAP) exam will be grounded until
              successful completion. A suitable study period of at least one day is required
              prior to retest (waiverable by SQ/CC). The squadron CCV Chief will establish
              written policy for grading monthly Boldface/CAPs exams. Grading may be
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                 109


             delegated, if necessary, to other than squadron FEs as designated in the squadron
             policy letter, but in no case delegated below the flight commander level.

     prior to their first flight of the month. SEPTs may be accomplished in the month prior
     but no earlier than the first day of that month. For example, the earliest that crews could
     accomplish November’s SEPTs is October 1. One SEPT session will NOT fulfill this
     requirement for two months. An EP simulator may count as the monthly SEPT as long as
     the minimum SEPT requirements are met. Squadrons will track SEPT accomplishment
     in such a way as to ensure all emergency procedures (EP) are covered at least once within
     the calendar year.
  9.3.2. Units will define and publish their positive control system in the unit supplement to
  this instruction.
     9.3.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Units will develop procedures to notify off-station aircrews
     of new Go/No-Go items prior to the aircrew’s next takeoff.
         9.3.2.1.1. (Added-3WG) Each squadron will notify off-station aircrews by fax, e-
         mail, telephone, or any other means necessary to ensure they are aware of appropriate
         FCIFs or other Go/No-Go items. Off-station aircrew may access the 3 OG/OGV
         webpage, from any military networked computer at a deployed or contingency
         location.
     9.3.2.2. (Added-PACAF) Accomplish and annotate an annual review of FCIF Vol 1,
     Part B/C items. Inactive flyers for greater than 90 days will accomplish and annotate a
     review of FCIF Vol 1, Part B/C items.
         9.3.2.2.1. (Added-3WG) In September of each year (end of the fiscal year), 3
         OG/OGV will issue a CRF directing all 3 OG aircrew members to complete their
         annual review of FCIF Part B/C items. Individual acknowledgement of the CRF will
         serve as the required documentation and must be completed before the first flight of
         the new fiscal year.
     9.3.2.3. (Added-PACAF) Units will designate individuals (ops admin, 1COs, etc.)
     required to verify Go/No-Go status of aircrew members prior to releasing aircraft for any
     scheduled mission. Aircraft Commanders may perform this duty.
         9.3.2.3.1. (Added-3WG) The Operations Supervisor (or designated representative)
         will complete a thorough check to ensure all Go/No-Go items are
         completed/accomplished and signed off before the mission. The designated
         representative will not be part of the aircrew and is an independent check of Go/No-
110                               AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010


         Go compliance.       The Flight Lead/Aircraft Commander (and Mission Crew
         Commanders for E-3 Aircraft) will be the final check to ensure all Go/No-Go items
         are accomplished for all aircrew before crew step. This applies to deployed as well as
         home station sorties. ORM will be evaluated as a Go/No-Go item in accordance with
         AFI 11-418, Operations Supervision, 3 OG Sup 1, and squadron developed
         procedures.
      9.3.2.4. (Added-PACAF) Use the Go/No-Go procedures to document the review,
      certification, and acknowledgment of Volume 1 Part B information by assigned, attached,
      and visiting aircrew members. Volume 1 Part C may be monitored by using Go/No Go
      procedures at unit discretion. Units will utilize PEX for Go/No-Go to ensure verification
      that aircrews have acknowledged each applicable item. Backup Go/No-Go procedures
      will be maintained to permit Go/No-Go verification procedures when information system
      connectivity difficulties are experienced.
      9.3.2.5. (Added-3WG) Visiting Aircrew. Host units will assign a point of contact
      (POC) responsible to ensure visiting aircrew complete all requirements, to include the 3
      OG Local Area Orientation (LAO) briefing, prior to flight operations. These flight
      operations are defined as any sortie using locally approved procedures (3 WG IFG, 3WGI
      13-201, Airspace Management, AFI 13-212/Wg Sup 1, Range Planning and Operations,
      and so forth). The 3 OG/OGV will develop and maintain the LAO. The LAO will
      include, as a minimum, airfield layout, taxi route/arm-dearm procedures,
      arrival/departure procedures, airspace restrictions, pattern procedures, hot/hung
      armament, and hot brake locations.
   9.3.3. (Added-3WG) The 3 OG Program Management:
      9.3.3.1. (Added-3WG) The 3 OG/OGV is the OPR for the Go/No-Go program.
      SQ/CCV will manage the Go/No-Go program at squadron level.
      9.3.3.2. (Added-3WG) The SQ/CCV Chief will appoint a primary and alternate
      program manager for the squadron Go/No-Go program.
      9.3.3.3. (Added-3WG) Units will verify Go/No-Go status of all visiting aircrew prior to
      authorizing flight on 3 WG aircraft. In such cases, the visiting aircrew member will
      provide a letter approving their participation in the specific flights and a current copy of
      their individual training summary (ITS). The ITS will be used to verify items listed in
      the mandatory items paragraph above. A sample visiting aircrew flight release form is
      located on the 3 OGV webpage.
         9.3.3.3.1. (Added-3WG) Visiting aircrew flying on 3 OG aircraft will provide a
         copy of their AF Form 942, AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or
         Special Operational Duty, Letter of X’s, ARMS printout, interfly approval (if
         required), and training records (if upgrade training is to be accomplished). If
         additional information is required by individual units, that squadron CCV, in
         conjunction with the squadron operations section will develop unit-tailored visiting
         aircrew flight release procedures. The example found on the OGV webpage should
         be used as a guide to develop the unit process.
      9.3.3.4. (Added-3WG) The 3 OG crewmembers will ―sign off‖ FCIFs in PEX and
      Aircraft Commanders will use PEX to verify Go/No-Go status of each crewmember prior
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                                  111


       to crew launch. Squadrons may continue to use any specific mission launch checklists
       for crew launch; however, PEX will be used to validate crewmember Go/No-Go status.
       9.3.3.5. (Added-3WG) All crewmembers must show a ―Go‖ status for each Go/No-Go
       category in PEX or be annotated as approved to fly on a ―No-Go‖ status by an orders
       authenticating official. Additionally, a description of the decision to override a ―No-Go‖
       status is required.
          9.3.3.5.1. (Added-3WG) Squadron Aircrew Resource Management (SARM) will
          import PEX resource and training data from ARMS a minimum of once every duty
          day.
       9.3.3.6. (Added-3WG) SQ/CCV, or designated representatives, will continue to
       produce paper FCIF and Read File products in addition to loading them into PEX. In the
       event that PEX is unavailable prior to launch, crews may indicate acknowledgement of
       current FCIFs/read files by annotating the most recent FCIF number and their initials on
       the original crew orders.
       9.3.3.7. (Added-3WG) SQ/CCV will conduct monthly spot checks of the Go/No-Go
       program and report accomplishment and findings in the monthly report. Additionally,
       any findings of non-compliance require immediate notification to an appropriate
       supervisor, DO or SQ/CC.
   9.3.4. (Added-3WG) Off-Station Go/No-Go. Crewmembers will accomplish a new
   Go/No-Go check prior to each new crew duty day while off station. This check will
   encompass confirmation that no individual has become duty not to include flying (DNIF),
   accomplish a new ORM for the upcoming duty day, and checking for new FCIFs in Volume
   1 Part B. Check for new Part B FCIFs by any means available.
   9.3.5. (Added-3WG) Extended Beyond Scheduled Return Time (SRT). In the event of a
   crew being extended beyond their original SRT, the Aircraft Commander is responsible for
   contacting a squadron orders authenticating official to verify each crewmembers Go-No/Go
   status for the entire duration of the extension.
   9.3.6. (Added-3WG) Red Flag Alaska units operating out of Elmendorf will be in

is a message or another FCIF item, pertinent to the FCIF entry. If more than one reference is
needed, use REF B, C, etc.
      1. Applicability paragraph. This paragraph lists the MAJCOM(s) that the FCIF item is
         applicable to, lists the MAJCOM(s) that will retransmit the FCIF item and those
         MAJCOMs for which the FCIF item is ―for information only.‖
      2. Directive paragraph. FCIF authors will use this paragraph to give direction to aircrews
         regarding procedures or guidance. This information will be placed immediately
         following the applicability paragraph in order to ensure a consistent place for new
         procedures or guidance.
      3. Amplification paragraph. This paragraph should focus on background information to the
         aircrews or any other amplifying data deemed necessary by the FCIF item author for
         aircrews to understand the impetus behind the FCIF item. The FCIF item should be
         limited to one or two pages in length. Additional supporting background documentation
         should be included in attachments or references.
         a. Amplifying data may be organized into subparagraphs or follow-on paragraphs.
         b. If follow-on paragraphs are used, ensure paragraphs are numbered correctly.
      4. Administrative paragraph. Use this paragraph to show where the FCIF item is to be
         placed (Part B or C), and how for long the FCIF item is to remain in effect. Other items
         of an administrative nature may also be placed in this paragraph.
      5. Receipt/POC paragraph. This paragraph directs units to acknowledge receipt of the FCIF

                 RECOMMENDING CHANGES TO AF PUBLICATIONS

A9.1. General. The stan/eval function is responsible for the orderly and efficient processing of
recommended changes to Air Force flying-related publications at each command level. Unless
different guidance is provided by the appropriate AF publication OPR, submit recommended
changes and improvements to Air Force publications on AF Form 847 according to the
procedures below and in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3 (covering completion of the form). Submit
recommended changes for conditions that have negative effects on operational efficiency, to
correct content errors or to recommend improved procedures or processes. Do not use the AF
Form 847 to call attention to typographical, printing or quality errors unless they cause
misinterpretation. Such deficiencies can be remedied by direct communication with the AF
publication OPR.
A9.2. Processing AF Forms 847.
   A9.2.1. Submit and process all AF Forms 847 through MAJCOM channels as outlined in the
   MAJCOM supplement to this instruction, in accordance with routing as outlined in Figure
   A9.1 and in compliance with instructions in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3. ANG units will
   utilize the NAF/MAJCOM command structure with oversight responsibility. Units will
   submit AF Forms 847 electronically to the maximum extent possible.
   A9.2.2. At each level the stan/eval function will document receipt of original AF Forms 847,
   ensure the AF Form 847 reaches the appropriate functional OPR at that level for review,
   forward approved original AF Forms 847 to the next command level while informing the
   preceding command level of disposition (positive and negative) with comments. The advent
   of electronic Forms 847 may allow each level to inform all levels below (including the
   originator) of such disposition. The goal is to keep each command level and the originator
   advised of the progress and disposition of a submitted AF Form 847.
   A9.2.3. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will forward the reviewed original AF Form
   847 to the AF publication OPR. Once the AF publication OPR decides on disposition of the
   AF Form 847, the AF publication OPR will notify the submitting, parent MAJCOM as to
   disposition. The parent MAJCOM will then inform the lower command levels of the
   disposition of the original AF Form 847.
   A9.2.4. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will simultaneously forward information
   copies of AF Forms 847 to all other MAJCOMs that utilize the subject AF publication. The
   other using MAJCOMs may forward comments on the information AF Form 847 suggestions
   to the AF publication OPR.
   A9.2.5. An AF Form 847 may be disapproved by any command level reviewing the original
   AF Form 847. All disapproved recommendations will be returned to the submitting
   command level with justification annotated on the AF Form 847 stating the reason for the
   disapproval. Disapproved recommendations are not normally forwarded to other MAJCOMs,
   but may be forwarded for additional considerations if desired. MAJCOMs may address how
   to resubmit an AF Form 847 disapproved at a command level below the AF publication OPR
   in their supplement to this instruction.
AFI11-202V2_PACAFSUP_3WGSUP_I 11 MARCH 2010                                             169


  A9.2.6. The movement and disposition of the original AF Form 847 will be tracked by the
  stan/eval function at all command levels that review the original AF Form 847. There is no
  requirement to track receipt or disposition of information copies of an AF Form 847.
