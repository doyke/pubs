1. Recall Procedures. Mountain Home AFB (MHAFB) may be required to increase its
readiness posture to prepare for or respond to many possible scenarios, including exercises or
inspections, severe weather, increased terrorist threat, contingency operations, or general war.
There is a continuous threat of terrorism, sabotage, and other clandestine or covert activities
against U.S. civilian and military installations.
    1.1. Recall execution postures the wing for contingency operations and involves activities
    such as installation control center (ICC) activation, unit control center (UCC) stand up,
    personnel accountability, sortie generation, and disaster response. 366 FW/CC will
    determine the extent and type of recall.
    1.2. The pyramid system provides a means to rapidly spreading alert messages and recalling
    personnel within a unit, beginning with the key position in each organization down to the
    lowest levels of the command chain. Each person notified will pass the recall information to
    others. See Attachments 2, Recall Roster Template Front, and Attachment 3, Mandatory
MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI10-202 11 FEBRUARY 2010                                                       3


  Use Recall Roster Back, for proper formatting of recall rosters. Units are authorized to add
  information to the back of the recall roster as long as the mandatory items in place.
  1.3. Immediate action is required by each individual to pass recall information and ensure
  continuity of the pyramid. Prompt response to the recall is required, tempered only by safety.
  For accountability recalls during natural or manmade disasters or crisis, AF personnel and
  family members are encouraged to log into https://afpaas.af.mil, or call 1-800-435-9941 to
  report individual and family member status.
  1.4. Continuity of the pyramid is essential. Therefore, when an individual cannot be
  contacted, the person attempting contact is responsible for alerting all personnel whom the
  absent person would normally contact. In the event an individual cannot be contacted, that
  information is passed to the next available person. Personnel at the bottom of the pyramid or
  unit-designated representatives will contact their UCC and work center to inform them their
  portion of the pyramid recall is complete. Additionally, personnel at the bottom of the
  pyramid or unit-designated representatives will forward names of personnel not contacted to
  their UCC and work center as directed.
  1.5. Upon arrival, each person must report/sign-in at their UCC, then duty section and
  receive a briefing explaining why they were recalled. Strength reports are consolidated by
  the UCC. Strength reporting procedures are outlined in Section 2 of this instruction.
  1.6. 366 FW agency chiefs and unit commanders will periodically brief their personnel on
  366 FW recall procedures. They must stress the importance of expeditious and safe
  response, relay accurately the recall message to those under them on the pyramid, and to
  report any changes that will affect the pyramid system, immediately.
  1.7. Update recall rosters and publish a minimum of once each month. Group commanders
  are responsible for ensuring rosters for their group/staff agencies are current and accurate.
  Group and wing staff agency recall rosters will be forwarded to 366 FW/CP (Command Post)
  "366FW.CP@mountainhome.af.mil" no later than the 1st of each month.
     1.7.1. Each recall roster must contain the following: recall pyramid, list of 366 FW
     recall types, and marked For Official Use Only (top, bottom, front, and back). Units are
     encouraged to place additional unit specific information on the recall rosters. The
     pyramid system will work only when the chain is unbroken. In the event a person cannot
     be contacted, the person attempting contact becomes responsible for notifying those
     individuals in the pyramid structure below the individual who cannot be contacted. They
     must also pass the names of the personnel who have not been contacted. Personnel need
     to instruct all adult members of their families on the importance of recall notification.
     This appendix requires the collection and/or maintenance of information protected by the
     Privacy Act of 1974. The authority to collect and/or maintain the records prescribed in
     this appendix is Title 10, USC Section 8013. Consult AFI 33-332 for specific guidance
     on statements.
  1.8. During nonduty hours, and when directed by 366 FW/CC or designated representative,
  366 FW/CP will initiate the recall type directed by contacting individuals identified in this
  plan. Each unit commander or Director of Staff (DS) will then activate their pyramid recall
  plan.

    1.9. During normal duty hours, 366 FW/CP is responsible for contacting all group
    commanders and 366 FW/DS. Group commanders and 366 FW/DS are then responsible for
    further recall notification of assigned personnel.
       1.9.1. 366 FW/CC determines the type, option(s) and extent of the recall.
       1.9.2. 366 FW/CP Emergency Actions controllers will:
          1.9.2.1. Define and communicate Recall Initiation Time (RIT) in local time.
          1.9.2.2. Complete the appropriate recall Quick Reaction Checklist (QRC).
          1.9.2.3. Contact the 366th Security Forces Squadron (366 SFS) and request a sentry
          for ICC entry control point (ECP) duties if in Force Protection Condition (FPCON)
          Charlie or other emergency circumstances exist.
       1.9.3. Squadrons/units will initiate 24-hour UCC operations until further notice and
       recall in accordance with (IAW) this instruction.
       1.9.4. When authorized by 366 FW/CC, commanders may excuse personnel from
       responding to a recall (days off, leave, passes, etc.). Commanders may exempt selected
       individuals involved in essential peacetime activities (e.g., aircrew in crew rest, hospital
       shift personnel, AF Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), etc.). Personnel operating
       24-hour work centers or currently not on duty during a recall may be placed on telephone
       stand-by instead of being recalled. It is the unit commander or agency chief's decision to
       place shift workers on telephone stand-by.
       1.9.5. UCCs will begin strength reporting IAW this instruction.
       1.9.6. Personnel response:
          1.9.7.1. Recalled personnel who feel they cannot safely and legally respond to a
          recall (e.g., under the influence of medications or alcohol), will notify their supervisor
          immediately.
          1.9.7.2. Recalled personnel will not shave, shower or eat prior to reporting to their
          work center. Response to a recall is not a sufficient reason to exceed normal speed
          limits or drive without due care and caution.
          1.9.7.3. Recalled personnel will report to their normal duty stations in uniform (battle
          dress uniform (BDU)/Airman battle uniform (ABU)/flight suit) with the appropriate
          gear as soon as possible.
          1.9.7.4. During recall responses, personnel will increase security, vigilance, and
          antiterrorism awareness incrementally based on the force protection condition
          (FPCON) and should assume recall procedures are monitored.
       1.9.8. Augmentees will report to their normal duty locations and wait for tasking from
       their unit.
    1.10. Recalls are not accomplished by public announcement (news media) unless 366
    FW/CC or designated representative advises otherwise. Press releases will only be as
    directed by the appropriate higher headquarters (HHQ) or 366 FW/CC (Commander) through
    366 FW/Public Affairs. The actual reason for a recall will not be announced. The word
    "exercise" is used when appropriate. Personnel will respond to recalls as directed.
MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI10-202 11 FEBRUARY 2010                                                         5


   1.11. Although units must be able to recall personnel from leave or temporary duty (TDY),
   no action will be taken locally to require physical return of these members unless specifically
   directed by the appropriate major command, HHQ, or 366 FW/CC.
2. Strength Reporting:
   2.1. Recall phase starts with approval of 366 FW/CC or designated representative, and ends
   when wing accountability is 100 percent or as directed by 366 FW/CC or designated
   representative.
   2.2. As soon as possible after a recall, UCCs will begin strength reporting procedures. Upon
   activation, liaison officers (LNO) will call the ICC Emergency Action (EA) controllers to
   obtain RIT, if not known. LNOs will relay RIT to each UCC in their group.
      2.2.1. Theater Battle Management Computer System (TBMCS) is the primary strength
      reporting tool.
      2.2.2. Strength reports should flow directly from UCCs to LNOs to the ICC. The ICC
      Director briefs 366 FW/CC on the recall status.
      2.2.3. Report data NLT the following timeline:
UCC UPDATE                   LNO UPDATE                       ICC DIRECTOR
RIT + 0:40                   RIT + 0:45                       RIT + 1:00
RIT + 1:40                   RIT + 1:45                       RIT + 2:00
RIT + 2:40                   RIT + 2:45                       RIT + 3:00
      2.2.4. Each report will include:
          2.2.4.1. Total number contacted (but not present for duty) + present for duty. Percent
          of available personnel contacted or reported for duty (number present for duty +
          contacted, divided by number available).
          2.2.4.2. Only the first report will include:
              2.2.4.2.1. Total assigned.
              2.2.4.2.2. Total excused (which includes leave, TDY, hospital/quarters, confined,
              exempt, in-processing, out-processing).
              2.2.4.2.3. Total available (assigned - excused).
          2.2.4.3. Strength reporting goals are as follows:
              2.2.4.3.1. 80 percent of available personnel contacted or present for duty RIT+2
              hours.
              2.2.4.3.2. 100 percent of available personnel contacted or present for duty at
              RIT+3 hours.
              2.2.4.3.3. UCCs will continue strength reporting hourly until 100 percent of
              available personnel are contacted or present for duty.
          2.2.4.4. Use Manual Strength Reporting if problems prevent TBMCS usage and a
          UCC update is due. LNOs and UCCs will use the Manual Strength Reporting table in
          Attachment 4, Sample of Manual Strength Collection, as a backup at all times during
          a recall.

    2.3. 366 FW/CP will complete the appropriate recall QRC and announce over the
    "Gunfighter" land mobile radio (LMR) net (during duty hours) type of recall being initiated
    (e.g., Installation Control Center (ICC), Emergency Operations Center (EOC), General, etc.)
    and any special instructions required. Refer to Attachments 5, 366th Fighter Wing General
    Recall Pyramid, and Attachment 6, Sample of Initiating a Recall.
       2.3.1. Recalls:
           2.3.1.1. Tier 1 (Installation Control Center (ICC)) Recall – A recall intended to
           assemble senior military leaders in the ICC to advise 366 FW/CC during contingency
           response decision making. A Tier 1 Recall may or may not include activation of
           EOC. See paragraph 2.3.1.3.1. for composition of the ICC.
           2.3.1.2. General Recall – A recall of all personnel to their LNOs/UCCs/work
           centers, or direct personnel into crew rest/shift work or to account for them during a
           contingency response. Wing recalls flow from the EA Cell to group commanders and
           down to squadron/unit commanders/agency chiefs down to individuals. Wing recalls
           require activation of all LNOs/UCCs and 24-hour operations unless otherwise noted.
           Wing recalls require strength reporting. Wing recalls will include RIT in local time.
           Reference wing recalls with using "Options" and a "FPCON." For example, an
           Airman could be contacted with the following words: "This is (Rank, Name) General
           Recall Option 2 and 4. Recall initiated at 0530L." This would direct the Airman to
           report to his/her work center with his/her mobility bags at his/her normal shift time,
           or at the time specified by 366 FW/CC or group commander via recall message.
           2.3.1.3. Selective Recalls can recall any of the following functions:
              2.3.1.3.1. ICC, which is comprised of: 366 FW/CC, 366 FW/CV (Vice
              Commander), all group commanders, 366 FW/DS, 366 FW/Command Chief
              Master Sergeant, ICC Director, 366 FW/Historian, 366 FW/Safety, 366
              FW/Plans, Programs, and Assessments, 366 FW/Force Protection Office, 366
              FW/PA, 366 FW/Judge Advocate, 366 SFS/CC, the 366th Logistics Readiness
              Squadron Commander, the 366th Communications Squadron Commander (366
              CS/CC), 366 FW/Chaplain, 366 FW/CP Chief/Superintendent, ICC Coordinator
              and two ICC Information Managers (ICC IM).
              2.3.1.3.2. Core Threat Working Group (TWG), which is comprised of: the 366th
              Operations Support Squadron, Intelligence Flight, AFOSI Det 221
              Superintendent; 366 FW/Force Protection, 366 CS/Information Assurance, 366
              SFS/CC and the 366th Aerospace Medicine Squadron, Public Health Flight (366
              AMDS/SGPM).
              2.3.1.3.3. EOC Recall (Incident Commander will normally direct the recall of
              appropriate Emergency Support Function (ESF) agencies (reference 366 FW 10-
              2).
              2.3.1.3.4. Accountability Recall – This recall tests the unit’s ability to make 100
              percent contact with all wing personnel. Strength reporting will be derived from
              the Air Force Personnel Acountability and Assessment System (AFPAAS)
              website at https://afpass.af.mil.
MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI10-202 11 FEBRUARY 2010                                                        7


  2.4. Recall Postures:
     2.4.1. Normal. This is the normal day-to-day posture. Normal wing policies are in
     effect.
     2.4.2. Twelve-Twelve (12-12). Critical personnel not on leave or TDY will follow the
     12-12 principle. Under the 12-12 principle, personnel will remain within 12 hours of
     contact from MHAFB and be able to report for duty within 12 hours after contact. This
     does not constitute leave policy, but rather assures personnel not available for up to 12
     hours (e.g., camping, hunting, skiing, away from contact), can be notified in the required
     time and report for duty. Assuming worst case scenario using the 12-12 principle, an
     individual will be available for duty within 24 hours.
     2.4.3. Six-Six (6-6). Critical personnel not on leave or TDY will follow the 6-6
     principle. Under the 6-6 principle, personnel will remain within 6 hours of contact from
     MHAFB and be able to report for duty within 6 hours after contact. This does not
     constitute leave policy, but rather assures personnel not available for up to 6 hours (e.g.,
     camping, hunting, skiing, away from contact), can be notified in the required time, and
     report for duty. Assuming worst case scenario using the 6-6 principle, an individual will
     be available for duty within 12 hours.
     2.4.4. Three-Three (3-3). Critical personnel not on leave or TDY will follow the 3-3
     principle. Under the 3-3 principle, personnel will remain within 3 hours of contact from
     MHAFB and be able to report for duty within 3 hours after contact. Assuming worst case
     scenario using the 3-3 principle, an individual will be available for duty within 6 hours.
     2.4.5. Telephone Stand-by. Critical personnel not on leave or TDY will be on
     telephone stand-by. When under telephone stand-by, personnel will remain within
     immediate contact vicinity (e.g., telephone, cell phone, pager, radio - number known to
     supervisor). Under this principle, an individual will be available for immediate
     notification and report to work in minimal amount of time (e.g., home to work, Boise to
     work).
     2.4.6. Communications-Out (Comm-Out) Recall:
         2.4.6.1. Recall notification procedures for situations when normal communications
         are not available. For a wing recall, EA controllers will attempt to notify ICC
         members using all communications available (LMR, cell phone, e-mail etc.). EA
         controllers will request 366 SFS send a runner to recall those members they were
         unable to contact. As with normal recalls, group commanders and 366 FW/DS will
         develop procedures for notifying their groups. If normal communications are
         available, but security is the over-riding concern, EA controllers will notify ICC
         members via secure communications or by runner.
         2.4.6.2. Comm-Out Procedures:
            2.4.6.2.1. When directed to conduct a "Comm-out" recall, EA controllers initiate
            the following sequence of events:
            2.4.6.2.2. Notify ICC members by the most efficient means available. If security
            is the overriding concern, communications will be over secure means or with a
            runner. "WING RECALL, TYPE "TIER ONE, GENERAL, or SELECTIVE"

              (one of the four is chosen to indicate the scope of the recall), OPTION 1, 2, 3, or 4
              (one of the 4 are chosen to indicate required equipment), FPCON: ALPHA,
              BRAVO, CHARLIE, or DELTA (to denote FPCON)."
              2.4.6.2.3. If personnel are not home, the team will leave a recall notice instructing
              them to report to their work center IAW recall instructions.
              2.4.6.2.4. Notification team will go to every home on their list, in order, to
              maintain continuity of the notification process. Log all contacts with member’s
              name, time notified, alternate point of contact (POC) name (i.e., family member),
              or if there was no contact made, but recall notice was left at the residence.
              Reasonable attempts should be made to contact the member. Also note problems
              encountered, such as failing to locate the residence, unable to access residence
              due to gate guard or vicious pets, or natural or manmade obstacles.
              2.4.6.2.5. After the teams have completed their list, return to their unit to report
              the results to the senior-ranking individual.
              2.4.6.2.6. See Attachment 7, Communication-Out Pre-Departure Checklist
    2.5. Use of Local Media to Recall MHAFB Personnel:
       2.5.1. 366 FW/CC or his designated representative is the only approval authority for use
       of local radio and television (TV) stations to announce a recall.
       2.5.2. When directed by 366 FW/CC, 366 FW/PA will contact local TV and radio
       stations and request the spot announcements listed below to advise military personnel
       assigned to MHAFB to immediately report for duty:
           2.5.2.1. "All 366th Fighter Wing personnel are directed by 366 FW/CC to report to
           their duty sections immediately."
           2.5.2.2. "All military personnel of the (specify unit) are directed by 366 FW/CC to
           report to their duty sections immediately."
           2.5.2.3. Upon receipt of notification through radio and/or TV of an actual recall of
           this wing, all personnel will immediately report to their duty sections.
    2.6. Recall Rosters:
       2.6.1. Military personnel are required to carry a recall roster on their person at all times.
       It is the individuals’ responsibility to keep the information on this roster current by
       immediately informing their supervisor and mobility office of any changes. The
       commander may modify this policy at any time to ensure an appropriate level of
       deployment readiness.
       2.6.2. Personnel will receive information about the type of recall, options, FPCON, and
       special instructions or reporting procedures when contacted.
       2.6.3. Personnel will pass the exact message as received. If unable to contact an
       individual, leave a message, contact the next person on the list, and notify UCCs of who
       was not contacted. If you are the last person on the list, contact your UCC and notify
       them you received the message and names of individuals not reached. Supervisors or
MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI10-202 11 FEBRUARY 2010                                                         9


     designated representatives will continue to attempt to contact individuals who were not
     contacted on the initial recall and inform the UCC status of the recall.
     2.6.4. Immediately proceed to the squadron/unit. Do not shave, shower, eat, or exceed
     the speed limit. Bring appropriate gear IAW recall option.
     2.6.5. Upon arrival at the squadron, immediately sign-in with your exact reporting time,
     review initial instructions, review ICCDs and proceed to your duty section for further
     instructions. Supervisors will account for their assigned personnel and report the
     following information to the mobility monitor: number assigned, number available for
     duty, number not available for duty with reason (e.g., TDY/leave, medically excused, or
     other). Attempt to contact initially noncontacted members by all means necessary. ICC
     members will report directly to ICC and then notify their respective UCC of arrival.
     2.6.6. For comm-out procedures, commanders/supervisors will implement a door-to-door
     recall. Once informed of the comm-out recall, follow paragraphs 2.4.6.2.1..
  2.7. Leave/TDY Personnel Recall Procedures:
     2.7.1. In the event members are TDY, each organizational commander is responsible for
     preparing recall messages IAW: Attachments 8, Sample Military Addressed Recall
     Message; Attachment 9, Sample Listing of Personnel TDY/On Leave Outside the Local
     Area; Attachment 10, Sample Recall Listing of Personnel TDY/On Leave in Local Area
     or TDY in AOR; and Attachment 11, Sample Message – Recall of Personnel from TDY.
     Units will deliver messages to the Personnel Readiness Unit.
     2.7.2. If an individual is TDY to another AF installation, the message goes directly to the
     TDY unit. If unable to determine TDY unit from orders, address message to the Forces
     Support Squadron, Personnel Readiness at the TDY location requesting assistance in
     notification. Do not send messages to the TDY location's wing or group commanders.
     2.7.3. If an individual is TDY to another branch of the Armed Forces, send the message
     directly to the TDY unit.

     and outside the local area. Deliver lists to the UCC and LNOs. Status of TDY/leave
     members is tracked until reaching 100 percent accountability.
     2.7.7. Unit commanders will need to establish procedures for recall of assigned
     personnel from leave/TDY. Recall of personnel from leave/TDY may be directed by HQ
     Air Combat Command, 366 FW/CC or unit commander. Reference Joint Federal Travel
     Regulations, Volume I, paragraph U7220, for responsibilities of expenses incurred during
