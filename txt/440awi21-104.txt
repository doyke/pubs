       2.2.5. Notify MOC of alpha or aircraft status change.
       2.2.6. As a minimum attend debrief for final sortie of the day.
    2.3. The Debrief Section (DS) will:
       2.3.1. Ensure debriefing is conducted at the termination of each sortie/mission regardless
       of landing status to include when a sortie/mission is aborted and after the last flight of the
       day for each aircraft. For off station missions and truck debrief refer to paragraph 3 of
       this instruction.
       2.3.2. Verify with aircrew member that mission data is entered and legible to include
       mission number, mission symbol, International Civilian Aviation Organization
       (ICAO)/Geographical Location (GEOLOC) code, total landings, total full stops, flying

      2.3.8. Verify the time entered in the MIS corresponds with the airframe time (sortie
      flown time) annotated on the AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and
      Maintenance Document and is corrected as necessary. At the completion of the flying
      period or last flight of the day close out and initiate a new AFTO Form 781H.
      2.3.9. Record flying times in the appropriate blocks of the AFTO Form 781J, Aerospace
      Vehicle Engine Flight Document. At the completion of the flying period or last flight of
      the day a new AFTO Form 781J, Aerospace Vehicle Engine Flight Document, may be
      initiated.
      2.3.10. Enter debrief discrepancies into GO81. The expediter will inform DS of what
      Symbol and Work Unit Code (WUC) to assign each job. The Pro Super will make the
      final determination of aircraft status.
      2.3.11. Enter aircraft discrepancies into GO81 that were discovered for aircraft off
      station that were not issued Job Control Number’s (JCN) by MOC.
      2.3.12. At a minimum the last five copies of the debriefs will be kept.
      2.3.13. Leave transcribed AFTO Form 781H in the 781 forms inbox for Plans,
      Scheduling & Documentation (PS&D) personnel to pick up daily.
   2.4. Operations Supervision will: Ensure an aircrew member takes part in each debriefing
   session.
   2.5. The Aircraft Commander (AC) will:
      2.5.1. Ensure Pope Command Post (CP) is contacted 20 minutes prior to landing to relay
      alpha status, fuel, LOX, and a short description of any discrepancies.
      2.5.2. Ensure applicable crewmember attends debriefing at the Debrief Section, after the
      last flight of the “flying period”.
          2.5.2.1. When the aircraft is flying again the same flying period, regardless of
          landing Alpha status, the crews will “Truck Debrief”.
      2.5.3. Ensure upon return from cross country missions all AFTO Forms 781, ARMS
      Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, and all aircraft mission related documents are
      brought in for debriefing.
          2.5.3.1. During non-duty hours leave forms on aircraft and fax 781 to Debrief at 394-
          6944 or scan to 440 MOC org box, 440.MOC.Org@us.af.mil.
3. Procedures:
   3.1. Cross-Country/Off Station Missions: The Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) will
   ensure that all discrepancies identified while aircraft is off station are called in or faxed to the
   MOC and thoroughly annotated on the AMC Form 278. Discrepancies will be entered by
   MOC into GO-81 and a JCN issued/entered into the aircraft forms by the MEP. When
   corrective actions have been accomplished for discrepancies, the MEP will call MOC with all
   the appropriate information for JCN sign off or closure. For discrepancies completed
   between flights, the crew chief will write “Corrected” after the discrepancy on the AMC
   Form 278, Debriefing Form. The MEP will attend final cross-country debriefing.

        3.1.1. At deployed locations aircraft will be debriefed following deployed location
        requirements. If deployed location debrief procedures are not available, debrief will
        follow established local procedures. For aircraft deployed the AMC Form 278,
        Debriefing Form, may be used to record discrepancies for multiple legs of a sortie on the
        same day. In the event multiple discrepancies are annotated on the same AMC Form
        278, Debriefing Form, each job control number needs to have sortie of the day/leg and
        base identifier recorded in the remarks section. For discrepancies completed between
        flights, the crew chief will write “Corrected” after the discrepancy on the AMC Form
        278, Debriefing Form.
     3.2. Truck Debrief: The AC or Flight Engineer (FE) will give the 781 Forms Binder to the
     Production Supervision before they do their post flight walk around. The Production
     Supervision will fill out the AMC Form 278. After crew post flight duties are complete,
     applicable crew members will meet with the Production Supervision to help complete the
     278 and answer any questions. When “Truck Debriefing”, give careful consideration when
     you make a write up Mission Essential (ME) or Mission Critical (MC). A MC discrepancy
     on a previous flight may be ME for subsequent flights on the same day. Once the AMC
     Form 278 is complete, take the AMC Form 278 & AFTO Form 781 flying hours form (not
     the binder) to the Debrief office. Do not take the 781 forms binder away from the aircraft,
     unless it is the last flight of the day. Once the debriefer reviews the forms, make copies of
     both. The crew will take the original 781 & copy of the AMC Form 278 back to Squadron
     Ops & give both to the Operations Supervisor.
     3.3. Flying Time Verification: A DS representative will go to the Squadron Aviation
     Resource Management (SARM) office (daily) to initial block 39 on the audited AFTO Form
     781. Any incorrect 781’s will be accompanied by SARM personnel to DS to input the
     corrections in GO81. DS will initial block 39 once the corrections are made.
4. Aircraft Flying Hour Accounting procedures.
     4.1. Operation Support (OS) Monitors and DS will:
        4.1.1. Following the completion of a flying period or completion of an off station
        mission, all sorties will be reconciled by the next duty day IAW AFI 21-103 AFRC SUP
        1.
     4.2. PS&D will:
        4.2.1. Request Maintenance Data System Analysis (MDSA) to provide daily and
        monthly Aircraft Utilization Reports (AUR) to the Aerospace Vehicle Utilization
        Monitor (AVUM), OS monitors, PS&D and the DS office.
        4.2.2. Validate flying hours daily with MDSA provided reports and the MIS.
     4.3. AVUM and PS&D will compare flying hours IAW AFI 21-103 AFRCSUP 1.
