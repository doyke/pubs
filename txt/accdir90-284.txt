1. General.
    1.1. Compliance and Standardization Requirements Lists (C&SRL) are the primary lists
    used during HQ ACC/IG Unit Compliance Inspections (UCI) to access unit compliance with
    guidance governing each particular area of operations. Items in this C&SRL are defined by
    the HQ ACC and, as applicable ANG and AFRC (for associate units only), staffs and based
    upon existing ―by-law‖ requirements, Executive Orders, DoD directives, AF and ACC
    guidance, and mission areas deemed critical by AF, ACC and/or ANG leadership in
    assessing and assuring unit organizational health and/or performance. The objective of the
    C&SRL is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities.
    1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCO) represent the highest priority of inspection items
    and are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCA) and the
    mission areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower tier Core and
    General Compliance Items may be stand alone or subordinate to a CCO. It is the intent of
    the evaluation team to inspect 100% of the CCOs as a minimum during the UCI, that apply to
    the inspected unit. However, C&SRL items listed do not limit the scope of the inspection.
    Critical, core and general compliance criteria are defined as follows:
       1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). A CCO is an area or item where unit
       failure to comply with established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of
       life or serious injury or significant mission impact. Key mission areas are:
- Airman development programs
- Ability to deploy forces
- Ability to employ forces
CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.
ACCDIR90-284 27 AUGUST 2009                                                                 3


        1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). A CCI is an item or area that requires special
        vigilance and is important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed
        "Critical." Non-compliance would result in some negative impact on mission
        performance or could result in injury or possible litigations. CCIs are shown in ALL
        CAPS FORMAT.
        1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). A GCI is an item or area deemed fundamental
        to successful overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in
        minimal impact on mission accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or
        possible litigation. GCIs are shown in sentence case format.

Terms
Compliance and Standardization Requirements List (C&SRL)—A comprehensive list of
items drawn from numerous directives that help determine unit compliance with public law,
executive orders, Department of Defense, and Air Force directives.
Core Compliance Item (CCI).—An item or area that requires special vigilance and is important
to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical." Non-compliance would
result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result in injury or possible
litigations.
Critical Compliance Objective (CCO).—An area or item where unit failure to comply with
established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or serious injury or
significant mission impact. Key mission areas are:
- Airman development programs
- Ability to deploy forces
- Ability to employ forces
ACCDIR90-284 27 AUGUST 2009                                                         39


General Compliance Item (GCI).—An item or area deemed fundamental to successful overall
performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal impact on mission
accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible litigation.
