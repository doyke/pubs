1. General:
     1.1. The Precious Metal Recovery Program (PRMP) is established to make sure precious
     metals, e.g., gold, silver, platinum, etc. are reclaimed, refined or used for authorized internal
     purposes. In keeping with the increased emphasis on precious metals, all base activities must
     make sure adequate controls are in effect and security measures are taken. The recovered
     metals must be properly accounted for, documented, and safeguarded at all levels. Glossary
     of References and Supporting Information are contained in Attachment 1.
     1.2. Control and accountability must be maintained on Precious Metals (PM) at all times.
     The use of PM is based on their great resistance to heat and oxidation. Silver may be
     recovered from two main sources: (1) various exhausted processing solutions, (2) scrap
     Polaroid film pack, film ash, drilling from anodes, unserviceable silver cell batteries, spent
     welding rods, photographic silver-foil battery plates, brazing wire and scrap produced from
     its use, silver-bearing amalgams or scrap from it, expended X-ray film, expended desalting
     kits and any other items which are produced or can be produced as scrap made up of
     economically recoverable silver. Attachment 2 Table A2.1. lists metals covered by the DoD
     Precious Metals Recovery Program.
        1.2.1. Exemption:     Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability Cost Designator
        (ERRCD) XD,XF,ND, NF, and XB3 items which retain their identity after use are
        exempt from the requirements for record keeping set forth in this instruction. These will
        be processed IAM normal turn-in process.
     1.3. Activities subject to generating PM scrap are overhaul and repair shops, plating shops,
     photographic laboratories, medical or maintenance x-ray laboratories, and Pass and
     Identification of the Security Forces Squadron. This instruction does not govern excess
     property shipped from the Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) to the DLA Disposition
     Services. Normal excess procedures apply to LRS excesses.
     1.4. Precious Metal Indicator Codes (PMIC) are used to identify defense material items that
     contain precious metals and the content value of the metal. PMIC are used on Electronic
     Turn-in Documents (ETID) to advise the Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services of
     the presence or absence of precious metals in or on an item of supply (Attachment 3). These
     codes are assigned only to national stock numbers (NSN). Organizational Bench Stock
     Listing (S04) denotes the PMIC assigned to an item. The appropriate phrase will also appear
     on the Asset Management delivery label.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. The installation commander appoints the Commander, 436th Logistics Readiness
     Squadron (436 LRS/CC) as the representative for the base PMRP. This designation will
     ensure an effective program for identification, control, and recovery of PM. The PRMP
     manager will ensure activities receiving, issuing, and using fine precious metals and/or items
     having a high content of precious metals which are assigned CIC ―R‖ appoint an
     individual(s) in writing to receipt and issue these materials.
     2.2. The 436 LRS/CC appoints the primary and alternate (respectively) Base Precious metals
     Monitor (BPMM) to act on behalf of the 436 LRS/CC. The BPMM will ensure procedures
     outlined in this instruction are enforced within each activity and will provide guidance for the
     safeguarding, accountability, and processing of PM to DLA Disposition Services.
