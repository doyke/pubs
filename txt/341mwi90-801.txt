SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been renamed and completely rewritten to streamline wing-specific
instruction while emphasizing mandatory AF-level guidance.
1. Overview: To ensure that information about the dangers of all hazardous chemicals used on
Malmstrom Air Force Base (MAFB) is known by all affected employees, the following
Hazardous Communication (HazCom) Program Instruction has been established.
 2                                                          341MWI90-801 25 OCTOBER 2011


2. Objective: Under this program, you will be informed of the contents of the OSHA Hazard
Communications standard, the hazardous properties of chemicals with which you work, safe
handling procedures and measures to take to protect yourself from these chemicals. This program
applies to all work sections/industrial shops on MAFB where you may be exposed to hazardous
chemicals under normal working conditions or during an emergency situation. All work sections
using and/or handling hazardous materials will participate in the Hazard Communication
(HazCom) Program.
3. Program Criteria: The HazCom Program consists of three parts.
     3.1. Workplace-specific written HazCom program, see Attachment 2.
     3.2. HazCom binder, see para 4.1 of this instruction
     3.3. Workplace-specific employee training plan, see para A2.1.4 Workplace supervisors
     will develop and maintain a written hazardous communication program and will be
     composed of a HazCom binder, a workplace specific HazCom written plan as in Attachment
     2, and a workplace specific employee training plan.
4. Responsibilities: Workplace supervisors of work sections/industrial shops using and/or
handling hazardous materials will maintain a HazCom Program.
     4.1. HazCom Binder: The binder will consist of a three-ring binder divided into nine tabs.
     The binder will be labeled with the unit or organization, workplace name and the words
     “HazCom Program Binder”. The written HazCom Program binder will have the following
     information contained in the tabs. Any item not in the binder will have an Optional Form 21
     Cross Reference Sheet, or similar document inserted in its place.
        4.1.1. Tab 1 – Workplace-specific written HazCom Program, see Attachment 2.
        4.1.2. Tab 2 – AFI90-821, Hazard Communication.

            Safety Office, and Fire Department review and approve the shop specific hazard
            training program for technical accuracy and completeness prior to implementation in
            the work area/shop. This training plan will contain all the elements outlined in AFI90-
            821, Para. 2.7.2.1.1. through 2.7.2.1.8.
        4.1.5. Tab 5 – Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs)
            4.1.5.1. An MSDS for each hazardous material in the workplace used for
            occupational
purposes. The manufacturer listed on each MSDS must match the manufacturer identified on the
hazardous material, as ingredients may change from manufacturer to manufacturer, within a
specific national stock number. MSDSs for products no longer in use will be removed.
        4.1.6. Tab 6 – Employee Information and Training.
            4.1.6.1. Documentation of all HazCom Program Training.
        4.1.7. Tab 7 – Hazardous Chemical Inventory & AF Form 3952’s
341MWI90-801 25 OCTOBER 2011                                                                     3

           temporary duties outside of the individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Code.
       4.1.9. Tab 9 – Misc. (Bioenvironmental Engineering Correspondence)
           4.1.9.1. Bioenvironmental Engineering         health    risk   assessments     of   the
           workplace/shop for the past 10 years.
5. Hazard Determination. The Air Force will rely on the hazard determination of the supplier
or manufacturer of purchased chemicals. For Air Force produced chemicals, the Air Force
activity controlling the formulation will make the hazard determination and produce an MSDS,
IAW 29 CFR 1910.1200. The Air Force activity producing the chemical will include hazard
determination procedures in their written program, and ensure their personnel are trained on the
hazards. If the chemical is transferred to any other organizations, the producing organization will
provide a MSDS with the shipment and transmit the MSDS to USAF School of Aerospace
Medicine.

                  HAZARD COMMUNICATION PROGRAM GUIDANCE
A2.1. This workplace specific Hazard Communication (HazCom) written program provides
information specific to the implementation of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 90-821, Hazard
Communication, at Malmstrom AFB, MT. AF HazCom program requirements apply to any
chemical hazard, except Materials Exempt from the AF HazCom Program as stated in AFI 90-
821, Para. 2.2., known to be present in work area/shop(s) in such a manner employees may be
exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable emergency. This program, a copy of
AFI 90-821, a work area hazardous chemical inventory, and list of non-routine tasks involving
hazardous materials will be maintained in this work area.
   A2.1.1. Supervisor Responsibilities: IAW AFI 90-821 Para 1.8.2.6. Supervisors will
   develop and maintain a work area/shop-specific HazCom written program. This written
   guidance serves as the written program and meets criteria outlined in AFI 90-821.
   A2.1.2. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs):
       A2.1.2.1. The (Shop’s Name) shop supervisor, maintains the MSDSs for each hazardous
       chemical.
       A2.1.2.2. MSDSs are in the form(s) of Hard Paper Copies and are kept explain where
       they are kept.
       A2.1.2.3. They are accessible to all workers during each work shift and can be easily
       obtained in the event of an emergency.
       A2.1.2.4. If a chemical is received without a MSDS, the shop supervisor will contact the
       manufacturer to have one sent or faxed. A temporary MSDS can be obtained from BE.
       A2.1.2.5. Supervisors will notify BE each time a new chemical is introduced into the
       work area.
   A2.1.3. Labels and Other Forms of Warning:
       A2.1.3.1. The shop supervisor will ensure labeling of hazardous chemical containers
       used in this work area is done according to 29 CFR 1910.1200(f), and DoDI 6050.5-H,
       DoD Hazardous Chemical Warning Labeling System, and AFI 90-821.
       A2.1.3.2. Shop supervisors will ensure labels meet HazCom requirements, remain
       affixed to their containers, and are not obliterated or covered.
       A2.1.3.3. Labels are verified for accuracy when products are received or replaced. A
       labeling system has been developed to identify hazardous chemicals that are issued by the
       Hazardous Material Pharmacy. Additional labeling is completed if primary containers
       are broken down and transferred into secondary containers.
   A2.1.4. Employee Information and Training:
       A2.1.4.1. The shop supervisor is responsible for ensuring all workers are properly
       trained on the AF HazCom.

       A2.1.4.5. The shop supervisor is required to document both worker initial and
       supplemental hazard communication training on AF Form 55 or in CAMS or in
       Enterprise Environmental Safety and Occupational Health-Management Information
       System (EESOH-MIS). This includes external HazCom training provided to AF
       supervisors and employees from contractor organizations where applicable. Supervisors
       may use the AF Form 3952 or BE special survey letters as sources of information to meet
       this training requirement.
    A2.1.5. Hazardous Chemical Inventory:
       A2.1.5.1. The shop supervisor maintains the hazardous chemical inventory and updates it
       as necessary. This inventory will be reviewed periodically by BE.
       A2.1.5.2. The inventory includes: the name of the chemical, the manufacturer, the work
       area in which the chemical is used, dates of use, and quantity used. Further information
       on each chemical may be obtained from the MSDSs. When new chemicals are received,
       this list is updated (including date the chemicals were introduced) within 30 days.

  A2.1.6. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials:
     A2.1.6.1. Supervisors will prepare a written description of all non-routine tasks
     performed, which involve hazardous materials. These tasks include work performed
     infrequently (i.e. cleaning a solvent tank and changing the solvent) within the workers
     normal work area and temporary duties performed outside an individuals normal AFSC
     or job series. All workers will review these procedures and be familiar with the hazards
     associated with the task(s) before performing the non-routine tasks.
     A2.1.6.2. Written descriptions are not required if Technical Orders or other official
     documents adequately describe non-routine task(s) or if the non-routine task is performed
     outside the work-center.
