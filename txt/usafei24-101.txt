TALKING PAPER
ON
AF SPOUSE TRAVEL


PURPOSE
To provide information on the criteria, approval authorities, and procedures by which spouses of Air
Force members may travel in conjunction with the member’s official duties


BACKGROUND
DoD policy on spouse travel has evolved over the past few years from an open-ended program with few
guidelines to the current program that stresses official needs and appropriate use of DoD resources.
Spouse travel is a subject of Congressional interest involving public scrutiny, GAO review and Inspector
General examination. For these reasons, DEPSECDEF has pronounced that both official and unofficial
spouse travel should be the “rare exception” and not the rule.
Policy guidance on spouse travel is contained in:
DoDD 4500.56, DoD Policy on Use of Government Aircraft and Air Travel;
DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility;
Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), Appendix E, and
AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement


BASIS FOR APPROVING OFFICIAL SPOUSE TRAVEL
Spouse travel at Government expense by commercial carrier or by MilAir may be approved by the appro-
priate approval authority only when one of the two following criteria is met and fully documented:


1. Where there is an unquestionably official event in which the spouse will actually participate in an offi-
cial capacity. Documentation must describe an overall itinerary, the official event(s) involved, how the
spouse will participate, and what benefit the Air Force or DoD will receive by funding the travel. In each
case, a separate itinerary for the spouse’s travel helps greatly in documenting and justifying the travel.
Some examples that may meet this criteria are:
22                                                                 USAFEI24-101 4 SEPTEMBER 2007


Participation in a DoD or Air Force sanctioned training course or conference for spouses supporting readi-
ness [see paragraph 2.8 of AFI 24-101 for circumstances and restrictions]. Documentation for travel to
these types of events must also include identification of the training source or conference speakers and a
description of the subject matter to be presented. A course syllabus or complete conference itinerary helps
support approval.
Provision by the spouse of advice or guidance as a “subject matter expert” in his or her own specialty.
Documentation for travel to these types of events must also include a description of the subject matter the
spouse would present (including his/her qualifications) and a description of the audience receiving the
presentation.
Accompanying his or her sponsor on unit or “site” visits (normally limited to units subordinate to the
sponsor at an installation under the sponsor’s command/control) only when the spouse will actually par-
ticipate by conferring with unit members/DoD officials on official DoD matters through an exchange of
substantive information, advice, and or guidance, and in a manner that directly benefits the Air Force.
Merely visiting facilities such as schools, hospitals, day-care facilities, family service centers, family
housing areas, commissaries, etc., is not on its own sufficient justification for spouse travel at Govern-
ment expense.
Documentation must record the audiences to be addressed, the issues to be covered and the anticipated
benefits to the Air Force. Where possible, documentation should also indicate the number of members and
dependents assigned to the unit(s) being visited.
Prospective travelers should also note the limits on the number of trips/events imposed by AFI 24-101,
paragraph 2.8.
It is also recommended that spouses making unit or site visits prepare a short after-action report of their
observations and recommendations for submission to their senior official’s spouse and others who may
benefit from the comments (e.g. host MAJCOM if location is overseen by a MAJCOM other than that to
which the senior official’s spouse is assigned). It will also help document the spouse’s participation in
official activities.


2. Where travel is deemed in the national interest because of diplomatic or public relations benefits to the
United States. While a spouse’s participation at some of these events may only be a representational role,
documentation must indicate how the spouse’s presence supports a diplomatic or public relations benefit
to the United States. The benefit must transcend the Air Force or DoD interests and be truly of national
interest. Involvement of foreign personnel alone does not justify spouse travel; the requisite national inter-
est must be clearly established. Documentation must specifically identify the event and attendees that
make the function a diplomatic or public relations event. Examples include, but are not limited to:
Attending official events involving senior foreign officials and their spouses.
Escorting foreign military spouses during counterpart or attaché visits.
Accompanying civic leaders of foreign Governments and their spouses, on Air Force-sponsored tours.
Official spouse travel cannot be approved merely to allow attendance at a promotion, retirement or
change of command ceremony. Official travel involving these types of events can only be approved if it
meets the “actual participation in an official event” criteria, addressed above. In most cases, this will be
hard to establish.
USAFEI24-101 4 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                                               23


Merely attending a ceremony over which the sponsor will preside is not sufficient justification for Gov-
ernment-funded spouse travel.
A spouse’s attendance at a wing change of command ceremony predicated upon the spouse’s intent to
present a gift to the outgoing unit CC’s spouse, and/or provide an orientation to the incoming unit CC’s
spouse, is not sufficient justification for Government-funded spouse travel.
When the spouse travel criteria is not met and the senior official wants his/her spouse to attend a cere-
mony, “unofficial travel” options can be pursued. Unofficial travel is addressed below.


AIR FORCE DESIGNATED SPOUSE TRAVEL APPROVAL AUTHORITIES
Only a very limited number of senior officials can self-approve spouse travel. All justification, documen-
tation and retention requirements identified herein apply to self-approved spouse travel.
Four-star general officers may self-approve as outlined in DoDD 4500.56, DoD Policy on the Use of Gov-
ernment Aircraft and Air Travel.
DoD policy authorizes select three-star general officers who serve as component/combined commanders
(e.g., 5 AF/CC, 7 AF/CC, 11 AF/CC and 16 AF/CC), while acting as the combined commander, to
approve spouse travel for themselves as well as for spouses under their command; however, for all other
travel they must seek approval through their Air Force chain of command.
Spouse travel approval for all other situations was delegated by Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) to
Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF), and the CSAF delegated this authority to MAJCOM/CCs and
CVs (also includes the Director, ANG) for all spouse/family member travel within their commands. See
SAFO 625.1, 21 Feb 02; AF/CC memo, 7 Mar 02; and AF/CC memo, 2 Feb 05.
MAJCOM vice commanders cannot approve their own spouse/family member travel, nor may the Vice
Commander approve MAJCOM Commander spouse/family member travel.
AF/CV must approve spouse/family member travel for Commander, Air Force Special Operations Com-
mand (AFSOC/CC), Commander, Air Force Reserve Comamnd (RE/AFRC/CC) and three-star Air Force
officer serving as the Director, Air National Guard (NGB/CF).
AF/CV must approve spouse travel for personnel assigned to the Air Staff, Field Operating Agencies
(FOA), and Direct Reporting Units (DRU) (except ANG). Requests are processed through AF/ILG.
SECAF must approve spouse travel for personnel assigned to the Air Force Secretariat.


PROCESSING SPOUSE TRAVEL REQUESTS
A separate spouse travel request must be forwarded to the appropriate approval authority for each event.
“Blanket” travel approval and Invitational Travel Authorizations (ITA) will not be issued.
All spouse travel requests will include full justification and indicate how the travel meets the established
spouse travel approval criteria. Spouse travel documentation will identify the proposed dates of travel and
the inclusive dates of the function/event to be attended. A separate spouse’s itinerary is required as part of
the spouse travel documentation package. Travel requests that are not fully substantiated will be returned.
24                                                                USAFEI24-101 4 SEPTEMBER 2007


Requests requiring Vice Commander, United States Air Force (AF/CV) or Commander, United States Air
Force (AF/CC) approval must be forwarded through command channels to AF/CV with an info copy to
AF/ILG.
AF/ILG will route all packages through General Counsel of the Air Force (SAF/GCA) for coordination
prior to staffing to AF/CV or AF/CC for approval.
All requests should be sent to AF/ILG not less than 20 days prior to the desired travel date.
Travel arrangements may not be made for spouse travel until approved by the appropriate approving offi-
cial.
As a general rule, upon approval, the spouse is issued an ITA, which authorizes funded transportation
only. Per diem or other reimbursements are not authorized unless approved in advance.
The following statement must be on the ITA: “This travel authorization authorizes the spouse to accom-
pany the sponsor to attend an official function. It does not authorize per diem or other expense allowances
for the spouse. If the spouse does not want to bear the expenses ordinarily reimbursed through per diem or
other expense allowances, this travel authorization is canceled”.
Per diem or other actual expenses may be paid in rare instances where the spouse travel can be justified as
“mission essential.” In these rare cases the spouse travel request must be routed through Deputy Chief of
Staff for Personnel, United States Air Force (AF/DP) for review and approval by AF/CC prior to travel.
This approval authority has not been delegated.
A record of all approvals, including justification, will be retained for two years at the approval authority
level.


Unofficial Spouse Travel
Unofficial travel allows a spouse to accompany a senior official who is using MilAir. Unofficial travel is
the “rare exception” and shall be carefully controlled by requiring approval in advance and in writing.
(DoDD 4500.56, DoD Policy on the Use of Government Aircraft and Air Travel).
This type of travel is limited to spouses of senior DoD officials (general officer or Senior Executive Ser-
vice (SES) member).
The DoD sponsor must reimburse the Government the cost of a “full coach fare” for the transportation
provided.
Full coach fare” is the fare a commercial carrier would charge for travel over a similar route on the dates
of the travel. Advantage can be taken of early purchase discounts and Internet purchasing alternatives as
long as the fare matches the times and dates of actual travel and is available to the general public. Docu-
mentation of the source of the ticket price should be maintained.
Members make reimbursement by including a check payable to Treasurer of the United States with their
travel voucher.
Other conditions must also be met before unofficial spouse travel can be approved, including:
The aircraft is already scheduled for an official purpose;
A larger aircraft than originally identified is not required;
USAFEI24-101 4 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                                             25


The travel is on a “noninterference” basis;
Official travelers are not displaced;
The travel is approved in advance and in writing by the appropriate authority for MilAir travel.


CONCLUSION
Spouse travel is a highly visible and sensitive area requiring careful oversight and prudent judgment by
both requesters and approval authorities.
Each case must be reviewed on its facts - prior approval of similar travel does not automatically grant
carte blanche approval of future similar official spouse travel. Justification for each trip must meet estab-
lished criteria, and the proper authority must grant approval.
Proper documentation of requests will help both the approval process and responses to inquiries by those
charged with oversight.
This guidance has been approved by the Air Force General Counsel's office. Refer questions to Dave Tho-
mas in SAF/GCA, 703-697-2687.
