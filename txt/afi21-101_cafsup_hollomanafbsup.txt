SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: This supplement was drafted using Guidance Memorandum 3 (GM3) dated 24
September 2012. We assessed our publication for non-value added language, areas that
previously limited the ability for maintenance leaders to make field level decisions, and for

irrelevant and unrealistic expectations with limited resources. Many deletions stem from
duplication between the parent AFI and other governing directives. These deletions may not
have changed previous requirements but only removed the duplication between directives. All
references to Air Force Global Strike Command aircraft and resources removed. Changed
verbiage as required to clarify responsibilities and renumbered paragraphs to better flow with the
parent publication. The supplement has significant changes from the previous version.
